I see what you're doing here, and this comment seems to allude to the reasons 
behind it without spelling it out.

Are you switching mms in order to avoid all of the overhead associated with 
flushing an active mm during task exit?  If so, it makes much more sense to 
do this in the generic helper, as it should be a win on x86 and x86-64 
where switching to init_mm is relatively low cost given the support for 
global pages.  I'll run some tests on a couple of systems this evening and 
post the results.
