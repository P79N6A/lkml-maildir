  I don't think what GRUB does is a wrong thing basically. Some types
of software always need (or want) to access raw devices, for example,
FDISK programs, filesystem resizers, and fast database servers. So,
AFAIK, all the realistic operating systems export raw devices to
user-level programs and support one or more system calls to keep
anything in the kernel consistent.
  For now, the grub shell calls sync() (twice before any operation)
and ioctl(fd, BLKFLSBUF, 0) (after and before operations) under
Linux. I thought that was enough, since sync should make filesystems
and buffer caches consistent, and BLKFLSBUF should flush buffer caches
to actual disks. I even thought that was overkill.
  Therefore, I was surprised when I heard that wasn't still enough. If
that is not a problem which should be fixed in Linux, how should we
fix the grub shell? What is supposed to do with raw devices?
