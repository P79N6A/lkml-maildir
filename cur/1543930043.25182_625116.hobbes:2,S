Given that it *didn't* totally break the build, it's likely a fencepost error
or some similar issue...

I wanted to give a heads-up, in case there was a D'Oh! patch hiding. At worst,
I just need another 6 or 7 bisects to figure out which of those 120-ish patches
is the culprit.  With luck I'll end up stopped on a patch that in retrospect
was obviously busticated.  If not, we'll have to apply the usual more drastic
measures.  If you don't have a box that's already demonstrating it, and you
don't have any obvious candidates, it's likely that the most productive
use of everybody's time is for you to chase down any other kobject issues
while I bisect the problem down further...
