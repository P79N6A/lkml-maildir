Hi,
2.6.5-rc1 compilation fails at arch/ppc/syslib/indirect_pci.c lines 47 and
86: variable dev isn't defined.
The change breaking it is a change from out_be32() to PCI_CFG_OUT (line
17513 of the patch at
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/testing/patch-2.6.5-rc1.bz2
 ,
which strangely enough doesn't show in bkweb interface).
