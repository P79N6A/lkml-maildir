| Converted to what/how?  I am confused by your question.
and:

OK, you made me look.  Most of that header file is reasonable except
for that set of #defines (IMO of course).
Being there doesn't mean that it was properly reviewed....
It can just mean that a merger/maintainer trusted whoever sent it
to them not to do undesirable things.

I see, thanks.

| Randy, here's an explanation given by Hollis Blanchard and Paul
| Mackerras that I'll add to the code as a comment.
| 
| The hcall interface involves putting 8 chars into each of two registers.
| We load up those 2 registers (in arch/ppc64/hvconsole.c) by casting
| char[16] to long[2].  It would work without __ALIGNED__, but a little
| (tiny) bit slower because an unaligned load is slower than aligned load.
Yes, thanks again.
