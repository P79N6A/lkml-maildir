It will be like tail packing in reiserfs, I believe.  FFS has fixed-sized
'fragments' while reiserfs has arbitrary-sized 'tails'.  The ext2 tail
packing will be arbitrary-sized tails, stored as an extended attribute
(along with any other EAs that this inode has.  With proper EA design,
you can share multiple inode's EAs in the same block.  We also discussed
for very small files that you could store the tail (or other EA data)
within the inode itself.
Cheers, Andreas
