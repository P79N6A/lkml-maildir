Could you please elaborate, why this is needed and put more info about
this requirement into this patch description?
People worked hard to push data allocation from stack to heap to make 
THREAD_ORDER of 0 and 1 possible. So why increase it again and why does this
help scalability?
Many thanks and Best Regards
