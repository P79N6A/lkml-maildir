I think you'll find that gets into trouble on the header page,
entry 0, which pmdisk/swsusp does access through this interface,
but swapping does not: I'd expect its swap_duplicate to fail.
I've put off dealing with this, wasn't a priority for me to
decide what to do with it.  You might experiment with setting
p->swap_map[0] = 1 instead of SWAP_MAP_BAD in sys_swapon, but
offhand I'm unsure whether that's enough e.g. would the totals
come out right, would swapoff complete?
Just an idea, not something to finalize.
Hugh
