It should be OK to rcu-free cgrp and have it still safe to call
cgroup_path() on it - as long as we're confident that the dentry (and
all its parents) won't be released until after the RCU section as
well, since that's where we get the path elements from. And that does
seem to be the case from looking at dcache.c
It's certainly nicer than having two calls to synchronize_rcu() in
quick succession in cgroup_diput().

I think it would be simpler to not have the cgroup exposed to the
subsystem until the dentry and other structures have been created. The
current order (create subsystems, then create fs structures) is more
or less a carry-over from when I extended cpusets, rather than an
explicit design choice.
