Your patch is very close to mine. I'll merge tthe two and will include
it in my next version.
My understand of opcontrol is that is passes the information from ophelp
to the kernel via /dev/oprofile. I don't know how it passes it to the oprofiled
daemon.
The daemon should not be difficult to change. I hacked something quickly
and got it up on pentium M. The only remaining problem is ophelp, I think.

I think it would be easier to check in /sys/kernel/perfmon to detect
that it is running on perfmon2. Then opcontrol can pass the inormation
around to ophelp, oprofiled is necessary. Ophelp then just needs
to know the perfmon2 register mapping for each CPU. I don't know
how this information is represented today.
