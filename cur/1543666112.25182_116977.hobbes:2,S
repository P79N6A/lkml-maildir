TCP/IP only requires two-way communicaton. It does not even
have to be reliable. There are IP/SCSI adapters and fibre
channel adapters already in the kernel.
Therefore, you just make a driver that substitutes for a
network communications adapter and away you go. PPP does not,
in principle, require simultaneous two-way communications.
However, current implimentations expect that a modem is
attached.
You should be able to use any serial cmmunications device
for a PPP link although one would have to make a serial driver
that handles the TX/RX direction-change in a transparent manner
as well as the RS-485 "address" problem. If the drivers on each
connected host communicate with each other, i.e., resolve their
own address problems,, then the payload between these hosts can
be the communications channels for PPP.
