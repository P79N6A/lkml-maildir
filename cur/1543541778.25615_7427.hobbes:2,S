Yes, unfortunately it should work. :(
No chance of the smbfs module being from an older kernel version? If you
only rebuilt your kernel and not the modules and somehow managed to get
the modules from the wrong version ... I know it sounds unlikely but could
you make sure that the smbfs module (assuming you are using a module) is
from the right kernel version?

I doubt it touched smbfs. URL?

Ok, that's a start. However the smbfs code is after the change more or
less identical to the smbclient code for reading a directory.
    linux-2.2.x/fs/smbfs/proc.c:smb_proc_readdir_long
    samba-2.0.7/source/libsmb/clientgen.c:cli_list
This problem was thought to be solved in 2.2.14. Some things were removed
from that code in 2.2.16, but it shouldn't make any difference with NT.
If you don't want to hunt this yourself I can have a look. I need a list
of the files in that dir (probably not the files themself). Here is a
"list" of empty files I made for testing the problem 2.2.14 fixed

I'm looking for something like that at best, but I'd be happy with the
output of the DOS dir command. Feel free to unpack this on the server and
see if you have problems with that dir too.
