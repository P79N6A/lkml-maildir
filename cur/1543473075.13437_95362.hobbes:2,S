If you want lots of flexibility from the shell, have a flexible
shell and lots of utilities available, rather than folding things 
into the kernel.  The kernel is not there to do the job of every
possible utiltity; the kernel is there to do jobs that no single
utility can do.  If you believe that the operating system should
be able to do the jobs of lots of applications, you know where
Microsoft is.

Everything you list as examples of "useless bloat" are things
that only the kernel can do properly in a multiuser system.
The point is that if you want to spew a lot of repeated data into 
a disk file, writing a small user-space utility to do it will
actually be _faster_ (because it doesn't have to read() a block
for every write() it does) and quite likely smaller than the
amount of extra kernel code needed to implement a pseudodevice.
