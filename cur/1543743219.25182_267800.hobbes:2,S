64 bytes is the minimum packet size of an ethernet frame (which includes 
the CRC).  ARP requests don't take up that much space so the kernel pads 
them out to be large enough.  A tcpdump will show you exactly how it looks.

802.3 stipulates 64 bytes for all ethernet frames.  If you have a 
program that is somehow sending frames smaller than that, yes, you (or 
something) is broken.  How exactly are you sending frames that you think 
are too small?
