Smart teams from IBM and Hitachi have been hammering away at this code
for a year or two now, and yet (roughly) here we are.  There have been
experiments involving plopping branches instead of int3's at probe
locations, but this is self-modifying code involving multiple
instructions, and appears to be tricky on SMP/preempt boxes.
