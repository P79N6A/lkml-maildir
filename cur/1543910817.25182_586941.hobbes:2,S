I seem to get a clear performance improvement in the kmalloc fast path.

This one:
SLUB Use cmpxchg() everywhere.
It applies to "SLUB: Single atomic instruction alloc/free using
cmpxchg".

Yes. slab_free in these tests falls mostly into __slab_free() slow path
(I instrumented the number of slow and fast path to get this). The small
performance hit (~10 cycles) can be explained by the added
preempt_disable()/preempt_enable().

Ok.
