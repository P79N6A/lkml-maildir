I can add a "me too" to this thread.
I began playing with 2.4 releases (again) at 2.4.2-ac23 and i can't
manage to boot it properly, even the 2.4.3-ac2. I have an adaptec 2940U
(aic7860 as driver tells me) and both drivers, old and new, dont work
properly. Either i get request_module[scsi_hostadapter]: Root fs not
mounted, and then what seems to be a random oops a couple of seconds
later in the beginning of the init scripts, or, root fs doesnt get
remounted rw, which is followed soon by some oopsen. I reported one back
then (
http://boudicca.tux.org/hypermail/linux-kernel/2001week13/0077.html
 ).
Looks weird ... have there been any changes around aic driver recently?
I can try to write down some more oopsen if anyone is interested ... 
On the other side, 2.2.19 with new aic driver 6.1.10 is working just
nice ...
