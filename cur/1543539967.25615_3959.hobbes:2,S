   ok, then I'd recommend it instead :)
   Vinay, have a look at how fs/exec.c:sys_uselib() (uselib(2) system
   call) works by using name lookup and then dentry_open() and
   file->f_op->read().
sys_uselib doesn't actually try to use f_op->read.  For that, you have
to look at kernel_read(); note the magic calls to set_fs(get_ds()) and
setfs(old_fs).  This does work, but it's not something which I suspect
we want to encourage wide-spread usage of in the kernel.
In general, it's far better to do file i/o outside the kernel than
inside the kernel, if it is at all possible.
