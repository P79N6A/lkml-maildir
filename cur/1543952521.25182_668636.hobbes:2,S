Subject: [PATCH 23 of 31] x86: unify pgd ctor/dtor
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/3/18/24

All pagetables need fundamentally the same setup and destruction, so
just use the same code for everything.
