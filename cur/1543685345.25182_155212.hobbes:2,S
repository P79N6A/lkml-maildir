I dug out my old (Panasonic) dot matrix printer (only parallel port
printer that was handy) and some continuous/fan-fold paper.
I'm using 2.6.0-test2 and it prints.  However, it's not in
USASCII characters that I can read, but I suspect that's a
different problem.  The good news is that my PC sends data to it.
