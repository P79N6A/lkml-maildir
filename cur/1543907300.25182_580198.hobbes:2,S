The trouble is you need to avoid conflicting attributes, otherwise
you risk cache corruption. This means the direct mapping needs to be fixed
up and the kernel needs to keep track of the ranges to prevent conflicts.
Also when there is already a MTRR it might not work due to the complicated
rules of MTRR<->PAT interaction.
Then there are old CPU errata that need to be handled etc.
There are also some other issues.
You didn't solve all that at all. If it was as simple as your patch
we would have long done it already.
