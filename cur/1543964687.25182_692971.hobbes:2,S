I saw you post a patch for macbook for correcting a bug with ata_ppiix.
But it doesn't seem the same problem. I don't get 0 but others values.
May be a problem occurs when merging the master and slave status register ?
Any idea how to debug this.
For information this happen on a HP Compaq dc7700p, and there no way on 
the bios to change the controller to ahci mode
Thanks
