I'd also like to note that I've had nothing but problems from WinModems. I
had a brand new P5/166 and a 3Com WinModem. The fastest transfer rate I
could get out if the damn 56K Winmodem was about 100btyes/s. That's
right...bytes/sec. Once I went out and bought a real modem, I now get
transfer speeds of what a 56K modem should do.
