I encountered this exact problem some time ago. Some discussion
but in the end the problem was blamed on rsync and nothing came
of it. I'll post an URL to the thread later on when I have the
time to dig it out.
I could swear that during early 240-testX this was not a problem,
but when I finally made a report about it and tried to go back
through earlier kernels, I could not reproduce. Also, this is
not reproducable under 2.2.X (for me, at least).
