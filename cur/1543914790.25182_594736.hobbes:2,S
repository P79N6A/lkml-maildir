I doubt your claim is true since the vast majority of kconfig users
are most likely not kernel developers.
@Greg:
Do you have any numbers regarding how your "Linux Kernel in a Nutshell" 
is selling?
Even download numbers?

It's not only about switching, the same problems awaits people when 
configuring a kernel for their hardware the first time.

Why don't we dump kconfig and write the .config by hand?  ;-)
More seriously:
Yes, there are many other important issues in the kernel.
But not fixing kconfig UI problems doesn't fix these issues faster.
I have seen people running into problems because some required 
option wasn't set - in the simplest cases things like IDE without DMA 
because a help text wasn't updated when more hardware support was added 
to a driver.
You might not care about the kconfig users.
But other people do.
