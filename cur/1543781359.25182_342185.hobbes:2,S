Hi Nathan,

You should probably be using the --no-index option of quilt 0.42 (if you
are using quilt as I presumed), as I heard Linus doesn't like these
index lines in the patches he receives.

Couldn't we check for the return value of driver->attach_adapter()? That
way this function could conditionally prevent i2c_probe() from being
run. This is just a random proposal, I don't know if some drivers would
have an interest in doing that.
Also, maybe we can put this new code in a separate function to be called
from both i2c_add_adapter and i2c_add_driver, so as to not duplicate
code? Or would this be too much overhead? It could be made inline then.
Again, just a random thought.

Thanks for the documentation update. However, you didn't update
i2c/porting-clients accordingly. Could you please?
Thanks,
