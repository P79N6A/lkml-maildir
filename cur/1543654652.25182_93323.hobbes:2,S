   So, does this mean you are happy if I produce patches with kernel/compat.c
   in them rather than code #ifdef'ed into the mainline? This, of course,
   begs the question of whether it should all go into kernel/compat.c or
   should there be an fs/compat.c, mm/compat.c ...
Yes, I'm fine with it.
My personal take on the next issue is that I do believe we should
have fs/compat.c et al.
But for you initial patch, just put it into kernel/compat.c
