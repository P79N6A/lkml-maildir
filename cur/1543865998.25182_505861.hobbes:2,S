We do that. IRQ0 is not happening. So simply it does not increment the
interrupt count. And it is human readable.

It is readable, as it reflects the reality which is going on in the
system and not some artificial view which you think is how the interrupt
count should be presented. /proc/interrupt _IS_ statistics about the
number of interrupts on particular interrupt numbers and nothing else.

Local APIC is not really part of the interrupt subsystem as it uses a
seperate entry vector for historic reasons and therefor is not handled
by setup/request/free/... _irq() functions.
