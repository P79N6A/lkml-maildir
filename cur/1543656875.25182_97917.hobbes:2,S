Subject: [PATCHSET][2.4]  generic support for systems with more than 8 CPUs (0/2)

Second attempt at 2.4 patch to support more than 8 CPU, non-NUMA systems in a generic way.
The main change since the first version is to use the physical destination APIC mode 
on such systems (reusing the summit code). This has made the patch simple, small and confined.
Now, I will only be looking at using the clustered APIC mode in the context of 2.5,
mainly due to the amount of change that it requires.
The patch set is as follows:
1/2 : checking for xAPIC support in the system
2/2 : switching to physical mode APIC setup in case of more than 8 CPU system
Thanks,
