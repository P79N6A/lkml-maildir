ok this is a real potential deadlock in a way, it takes two locks of 2
skbuffs without doing any kind of lock ordering; I think the following
patch should fix it. Just sort the lock taking order by address of the
skb.. it's not pretty but it's the best this can do in a minimally
invasive way.
I still agree with the comment that this code shouldn't live in the atm
layer...
