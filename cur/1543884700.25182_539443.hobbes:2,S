Yeah, I was getting too clever for my own boots :)
I think the patch has merit though. Unfortunate that it uses another page
flag, however it seemed to have quite a bit speedup on unlock_page (probably
from both the barriers and an extra random cacheline load (from the hash)).
I guess it has to get good results from more benchmarks...

That barrier was one too many :)
However I believe the fastpath barrier can go away because the PG_locked
operation is depending on the same cacheline as PG_waiters.
