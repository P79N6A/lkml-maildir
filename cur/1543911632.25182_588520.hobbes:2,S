If there is a way to toggle the power state from userspace, then a 
desktop environment or userland tool can emulate the Windows behavior if 
that is desired.  A lot of devices can charge via USB now, and this is 
actually more convenient on Linux than on Windows (in effect Windows 
requires drivers in order to charge something).  However, having direct 
control over this is useful.
According to the following thread, it appears one can get the needed 
functionality through libusb:
