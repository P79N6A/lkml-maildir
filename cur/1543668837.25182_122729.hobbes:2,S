I think that rather than blaming the cpu, the motherboard could be the
culprit.
the "nodma" option actually had me running around for about 4-5 months
earlier last year just because i was furious with the simple issue that
win9x worked flawlessly and my simple 2.4.x kernels just wouldnt work.
note: the 2.4.x kernels also used to show similar (but not exact)
symptoms... the system used to reboot automatically while the kernel bootup
was in progress (albeit, the automatic reboot used to take place while
initializing the hard disks... precisely speaking it used to reboot while
checking for partitions, or sometimes simply while checking for any ides
available..))
the "ide=nodma" option helped there, and have been working in all later
2.4.x kernels...
but a similar option for 2.5.x kernels dont seem to be doing the trick..
as far as the suggestions from dave are concerned, i have tried setting
1. cpu to 386 compatible
2. removing mce option
but the problem still remains..
at the moment i am trying to remove *all* options which are not required for
a simple kernel to function (eg. networking/ ). and trying it all over
again...
i'll send the new .config file over, if it works...
affly
