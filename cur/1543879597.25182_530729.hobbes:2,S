Yes, this does seem to work, thanks. Was thrown of a bit by having named the 
branch "v2.6.20". GIT and I disagree what it is that I want to happen when I 
say "git checkout v2.6.20" if v2.6.20 is also a tag on master.
The pull behaviour does not follow further branches:
rene@7ixe4:~/src/linux/local$ git branch
* 2.6.20
   master
rene@7ixe4:~/src/linux/local$ git checkout -b 7ixe4
Switched to a new branch "7ixe4"
rene@7ixe4:~/src/linux/local$ git pull
Warning: No merge candidate found because value of config option
          "branch.7ixe4.merge" does not match any remote branch fetched.
No changes.
This might in practice not be all bad in fact, and I suppose I understand 
how to "fix" it along the same lines as above.
But as happens very frequently with GIT, I get the feeling that I just don't 
understand how it's all intended to be used. It seems that what I wanted 
above is not standard? What would be expected use of the stable GIT repo? 
Just cloning that outright into another repo?
A "GIT WHYTO" from someone with the oversight would be very useful...
Rene.
