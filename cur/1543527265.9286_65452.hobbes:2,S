Subject: Fix for "unable to read partition table" bug in 2.3.48-pre1

The following patch is against 2.3.48-pre1 and corrects a bug
introduced in 2.3.48-pre1 which prevents reading of the partition
information from the slave drives of the IDE interface.  It probably also
(though I have no way of verifying) effects all but the first disk drive on
a SCSI bus.
