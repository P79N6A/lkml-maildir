There should be some diagnostic text just above this panic message,
what does it say?  At a guess, I'd say you have a corrupt inode on
disk, and your nightly cron jobs are tripping this up each time.
The panic happens cos the kernel detects an inode with an extent
map which claiming to have an extent starting at the offset of the
primary superblock.  I've seen another case of this recently which
looked like a possible compiler bug, so could you send me both the
full diagnostic message and your compiler version number?
Also, the diagnostic will contain an inode number - for bonus points
run "xfs_db -r -c 'inode XXX' -c print /dev/foo" and send me that as
well.  Thanks!
cheers.
