I have the same controller, but welded into an MSI KT4 Ultra.
With Mandrake 9.2 it gets detected and I was able to use the pata port with a 
20Gig Maxtor drive.
The module Mandrake uses for this is the pdc-ultra module, although I'm not 
sure if its in the kernel or a 3rd party addition by Mandrake.
Mark.
