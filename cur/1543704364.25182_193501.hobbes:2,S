The almost right solution here would be to write an xkb keyboard
description that matches the 2.6 keycode->scancode mappings, so that
once you get the 'setkeycodes' command right, both the kernel and X will
understand the keys correctly.
With your approach you got the keys correct solely in X, not the kernel.
I'll take a look at this.
The completely right approach would be to teach X to either use the
event interface or at least the medium raw mode.
