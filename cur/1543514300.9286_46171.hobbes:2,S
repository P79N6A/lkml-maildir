   As I see it, the ONLY part of all this that belongs in the individual
   tty driver is this part:
    1. When the driver is called to probe for the relevant hardware,
       it finds the state flag set to NOT-HERE.
    2. If the driver finds the relevant hardware present, it sets
       the state flag to FULL-DUPLEX.
Actually, I'd put the state flag in the line discpline specific data.
If you want half-duplex, when you change your tty to use a half-duplex
line discpline, it will set up the state variable accordingly.  Whether
or not a tty has any "duplexity" is function of the line discpline.  For
some, such as SLIP, or PPP, it may not make any sense at all.
