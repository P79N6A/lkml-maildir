They are here:

I should update to .20 soonish.

I'm still torn between CLOCK-Pro and CART. 
CLOCK-Pro is still vulnerable to the cyclic scan use case, since at that
time all pages will have equal distance.
CART might be fixable (my CART-r approach) but I still have to study the
full ramifications of that (does it hurt other workloads?).
Both seems quite capable to distinguish between recency and frequency.
Neither use this horrid swappiness knob to distinguish between mapped
and unmapped pages.
The main problem I'm having is test cases, notably the lack thereof.
(and lack of time ofcourse ;-)
