Can you clarify the situation here ... how did you change kernels?  Is
this an upgrade from say Redhat 5.2 to Redhat 6.0 or similar. If so then
I'd suggest that this has nothing to do with the kernel, but is a
run-level issue. When your distribution starts it first of all loads the
kernel, checks devices/memory etc. and then starts something called init
which can take you system into one of a set of "runlevels". Generally
runlevel 1 is "single user mode", runlevel 2 (or 3) is multi-user
without graphics (Or more properly without "X") ie you get a text based
login, and run level 4 or 5 is a graphical login which I think you may
be referring to.  If this is the case then it is your system which has
changed not the kernels, to fix this edit the line in  /etc/inittab to
change from:
id:5:initdefault:
to:
id:3:initdefault:
Note: These values are correct for a Redhat Linux system. Other systems
should have a description of each runlevel in the file /etc/inittab,
adjust accordingly.  If this isn't your problem then apologies for being
patronising, but you didn't explain things too well ...
