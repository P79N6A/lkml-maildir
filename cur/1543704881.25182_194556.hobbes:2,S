yes - any proposal is going to require reviewing all PIO reads
and how the read return value is consumed (or discarded).

yeah. My hope was it would be less invasive.
But more changes are probably needed than I expected.

While ia64/parisc platforms have HW support for this,
I totally agree it won't work well for most (x86) platforms.
I'd like to reduce the burden on the driver writers for common
drivers (eg MPT) used on "vanilla" x86.
And like I pointed out before, linux kernel needs to review panic()
calls to see if some of them could easily be eliminated. The general
robustness issues (eg pci_map_single() panics on failure) aren't
prerequisites for IO error checking, but the latter seems less
useful with out the former.
I'd like to defend the pci_map_single() interface. It was designed
to reduce the complexity at the cost of robustness.
I think it was a fair trade off at the time and it sounds like
the time has come for a different trade off.
thanks,
grant
