If CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED everything should work just fine with all old
initrd scripts.  It's only if you enable that option (which is enabled
by default) that you need to ensure that your distro has the latest
functionality so that everything works properly.
So, we should be fine here.  The distros that are up to date, and the
users of them, can disable the option.  All others need to keep it on.
