Dear Kernel People,
Since nobody followed up I've decided to provide additional information
which might help to pin point the problem.
I've loaded pcmcia_core with pc_debug=255
Troublesome lines for me are:
Jul  5 15:52:25 vaio kernel: pcmcia: registering new device pcmcia0.0
Jul  5 15:52:25 vaio kernel: cs: pcmcia_socket0: cs: overrun in pcmcia_get_next_tuple
Jul  5 15:52:26 vaio kernel: cs: pcmcia_socket0: cs: overrun in pcmcia_get_next_tuple
Full kern.log is available from
http://www.onerussian.com/Linux/bugs/pcmcia.modem/kern.log.debug
Please advise what else could I do to revive this modem to life
Thank you in advance
