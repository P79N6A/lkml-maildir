I noticed this interesting timing:
real    19m40.978s
user    28m7.860s
sys     5m19.660s
[summer@possum w3library]$
for running a command
I have another command that takes a while (a short one) so I ran this test:
[summer@possum summer]$ date;time /usr/bin/time -p sp.consolidate ;date
Tue Mar 28 08:31:06 WST 2000
real 365.74
user 568.52
sys 80.08
real    6m5.748s
user    9m28.520s
sys     1m20.100s

I don't know whether its related, but I've also noticed the bogus MIPS 
figure changed recently:
/var/log/dmesg:Calibrating delay loop... 233.47 BogoMIPS
/var/log/dmesg.2.2.14:Calibrating delay loop... 233.47 BogoMIPS
/var/log/dmesg.2.3.45:Calibrating delay loop... 233.47 BogoMIPS
/var/log/dmesg.2.3.47:Calibrating delay loop... 233.47 BogoMIPS
/var/log/dmesg.2.3.49:Calibrating delay loop... 233.47 BogoMIPS
/var/log/dmesg.2.3.99-pre1:Calibrating delay loop... 466.94 BogoMIPS
/var/log/dmesg.2.3.99-pre3:Calibrating delay loop... 466.94 BogoMIPS

Much as I'd like to explain it thus: "I have upgraded my CPU," the truth 
is that I haven't; it's still the same old Pentium II 233 that I've had 
for two years.
[summer@possum summer]$ grep -w Hz /var/log/dmesg*
