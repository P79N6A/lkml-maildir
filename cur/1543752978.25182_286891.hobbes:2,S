By the time I got there is was 35-01 :-)
I have 1 squawk and one question.
The squawk is the extra "-RT" in the Makefiles Extra-Version, I made 
it 3 times and failed to boot to it with my script before that light 
came on.
And, what happened to drivers/ieee1394/amdtp?  Its not even in the 
xconfig choices now.  And I use it with my Sony Digital8 camera.
Also, and this is a more general squawk, I have to unload all those 
ieee1394 stuffs, turn on the camera, and then reload it all before 
the camera is recognized and usable.  Ditto if I have it working, 
then turn the camera off, before I can access the camera again I have 
to  rmmod all that stuff and reload it again. This is probably 
something that can be done with hotplug, but the last time I played 
with that it was lockup the whole machine disaster.
This was true with 2.6.11-rc1, but I haven't checked that stuff yet 
after getting this to boot just now.
