If your RAID has 64K stripes, and the XFS partition is also tuned
for 64K, you expect those two to match, right ? But I bet the start
of the partition isn't aligned to a multiple of 64K..
In those cases I just use the whole disk instead of a partition,
or I dump the partition table with sfdisk, move the start of the
partition I'm using to a multiple of X, and re-read it. You need
to re-mkfs the fs though.
Not sure if it has any impact in your case, just thought I'd mention it.
Mike.
