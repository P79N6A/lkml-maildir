We can't use 64bit HPET everywhere because quite some chipsets only
support 32bit HPET. So it has to be a runtime switch depending on the 
capabilities of the hardware.

Hmm - didn't notice anything particularly slow. Or what were you thinking 
about regarding the latency? And it should only run at each timer interrupt,
so it isn't a fast path. So I guess it's best to run it always.
