Why not just specify the union of the different sets,
and those that don't implement parts leave those parts out?

If we have to export all these totally different implementations
via totally different paths, then we failed.

sysfs is great for demos from a shell prompt,
but isn't such a great programming interface, either
from inside the kernel or from user-space.

No need to poll for status that hasn't even changed.
This is what events are for.
Also, critical battery alarms are important events.
Please do not add more polling to user-space, else DaveJ
will be putting it up as a further example of "Why userspace sucks"
at the next OLS:-)

I think the question is where the GUI is going to go look for it.
I could imagine it would be simple for userspace to look for
/dev/battery0
/dev/battery1
/dev/battery2
until it finds no more, and then present the capacity of each
if it wants to.
