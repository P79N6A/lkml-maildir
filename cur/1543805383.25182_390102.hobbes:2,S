Ironically enough, it's security. :)

Nah, it's used for vfprintf() argument-area checking.
Specifically, it's the Linux implementation of __readonly_area(),
located in sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/readonly-area.c in glibc-3.4-to-be,
and used by vfprintf() on behalf of __vfprintf_chk(). Calls to this
function (and the other __*_chk() functions) are expanded by glibc's
string headers and generated by GCC 4.1+ automatically when possible
(and by GCCs out there in the field: this patch is shipped by RH
already, known as FORTIFY_SOURCE).
FORTIFY_SOURCE zaps a whole class of security vulnerabilities stone
dead. Breaking it would be a bad idea. Therefore, /proc/self/maps has to
remain readable, even in setuid programs, because setuid programs are
one class of programs for which FORTIFY_SOURCE is crucial.
