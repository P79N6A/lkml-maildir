No. The softirq implementation is buggy.
I can trigger the problem with the TASKLET_HI (floppy), and both net rx
and tx (ping -l)

Ok, there are 2 bugs that are (afaics) impossible to fix without
checking for pending softirq's in cpu_idle():
a)
queue_task(my_task1, tq_immediate);
mark_bh();
schedule();
;within schedule: do_softirq()
;within my_task1:
mark_bh();
; bh returns, but do_softirq won't loop
; do_softirq returns.
; schedule() clears current->need_resched
; idle thread scheduled.
--> idle can run although softirq's are pending
I assume I trigger this race with the floppy driver.
b)
hw interrupt
do_softirq
within the net_rx handler: another hw interrupt, additional packets are
queued
do_softirq won't loop.
returns to idle thread. --> packets delayed unnecessary.
What about the attached patch? Obviously the other idle cpu must be
converted to use the function as well.
