Definitely. One thing is: how to do it instead ? I've been thinking
about it for a while and am still wondering... do we want a list
mecanism with add/remove notifiers so the PM walk can keep in sync
with devices added/removed ? or should addition/removal be simply
postponed until the end of the sleep/wakeup process (I tend to vote
for that).
