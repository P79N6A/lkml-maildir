Actually my guess is that the _data_ itself is not corrupt, neither the
original set located on 3ware RAID nor the backup'ed set on aic-connected SDLT.
The problem is - according to my personal opinion - flawed during the readback
that occurs while verifying. I do not know if the data is already corrupted by
the aic-driver (less probable currently) or some flaw inside the caching of the
_original_ set. The situation is complex because of the multiple involved
subsystems. 
My experience is this:
If you reboot and make backup/verify cycle from 3ware to aic/tape everything
seems fine.
If you reboot and push data over NFS to 3ware-disk, then do the backup/verify
cycle (with this data) from 3ware to aic/tape the corruption is very likely.
If you do try another verify run of the data you see corruptions happen on
_other_ files than the verify before. It is therefore unlikely that both data
"ends" are part of the problem, because you would expect the same corruptions
to show up - at least this is my hope.

Stephan
