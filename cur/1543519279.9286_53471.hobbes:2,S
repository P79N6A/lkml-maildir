     According to various faqs I've read, Qlogic/ISP ISP1000 based disk
controllers including those made by PTI are supported.
     So, needing to connect some single-ended ultra-wide SCSI disks and needing
more I/O than the 10mb/s fast-narrow controller could accomodate, I purchased a
PTI SBS450S-10704 SCSI controller and attempted to install it on a Sun 4/670MP
running Linux 2.2.13, using a kernel I built which did include the ISP drivers.
     The probe-scsi-all command saw this controller and all the drives attached
fine despite being document as not being supported.
     When I tried to boot linux, I got the following error:
qpti0: IRQ 53 SCSI ID 7 <0>qlogicicpt0: Firmware dload failed, I'm bolixed!
Kernel Panic: SBUS Qlogic/ISP firmware load failed.
     It then proceeded to do the:
AIEEE Interupt handler... something or other and then spinlocks...
     There must be a secret but I don't know what it is.  Can anyone enlighten
me as to what the magic incantations are that are necessary to get this to
work?
