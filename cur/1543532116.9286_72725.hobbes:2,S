That would solve the problem of a given thread seeing its own thread, but it
doesn't deal with the problem of pthread signal semantics.  Under pthreads, if
you send a signal to a process (a bunch of threads), it can be handled by any
thread which isn't blocking that signal.  Linux only allows you to send signals
to a particular task.  If you put all the tasks into a group you could signal
them all, but that's not right either, since the signal could be handled
multiple times by multiple threads.
