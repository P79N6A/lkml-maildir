I've been running 2.4.0-test12 patched with only the O_SYNC bug fix and I have
_not_ experienced any lockups on this machine.
Classic Athlon 825(750) MHz, 128MB Ram,
RH 7.0 based w/glibc 2.2, XFree-3.3.6 (S3 Trio 64 accel server), gcc 2.95.2
Not sure what the problem is yet... keep trying folks. :)
