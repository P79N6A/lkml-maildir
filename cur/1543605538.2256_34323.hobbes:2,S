I did say that in the original report:
"It used to give a nice error when disk size was exceeded with 2.2.18pre19
and a tad older cdrecord..."
but I could have been clearer.

Ok. I'll compile the newest from source.
But do you think the too-large-image lock up might be cured with a newer
cdrecord, or should is the kernel the prime suspect?
I will try anyway and report back to you.

Well, most software software seems to work with both 2.2 and 2.4. I didn't
think carefully enough to realize that some interfaces must have changed.

I see. Thanks for the clarification.
