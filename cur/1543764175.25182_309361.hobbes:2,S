Hi.
My mouse stopped working in x.org with 2.6.12-rc1. Problem is still there in 
2.6.12-rc2. Works on 2.6.11.x with same .config (except for make oldconfig / 
defaults).
Mouse is ImPs2, xorg.conf is using /dev/input/mouse0, which seems to be 
present. Board is Asus p4p800 deluxe.
More info available on request.
I'm not subscribed to the list so please cc any response.
Cheers,
Joe
