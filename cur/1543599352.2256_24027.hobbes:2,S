Most linux kernel ports export the sys_call_table symbol to be used in
modules. I have not succeeded how to automatially figure out the size
of a syscall pointer without inspecting the assembler for the
architecture in question. Examples are mips and sparc64. Have I
missed a syscall_t type available or shouldn't there be one?
Harald.
