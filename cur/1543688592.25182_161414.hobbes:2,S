Do you get any slowdown with the extents on small files though?
The plan is to add extent reading code to the three other stable trees so
that at the very least you could have read-only access to the extent based
ext2/3.
Remember, if the implementation of journaling hadn't have been so extensive,
we wouldn't have an ext3, but ext2 with journaling (and called ext2).
So what this will be is ext2 format with extents, and with (ext3) or without
journaling (ext2).
And this is planned for 2.7, so if anything goes into 2.6, it'll be
read-only support of extents.
