As long as each sound card has it's own /dev/dsp:
esd -port 5001 -d /dev/dsp1 &
esd -port 5002 -d /dev/dsp2 &
esd -port 5003 -d /dev/dsp3 &
For each stream, you'd need to set the ESPEAKER env. var.
accordingly:
card 1: export ESPEAKER=:5001  or  setenv ESPEAKER :5001
card 2: export ESPEAKER=:5002  or  setenv ESPEAKER :5002
card 3: export ESPEAKER=:5003  or  setenv ESPEAKER :5003
Alan, you want to let me know if^H^H how that works out? =)
