I'm not seeing this here, and I'd be very surprised to find anything at vger
fiddling with message headers like this. Some people's MUAs may generate tabs
in the headers, but AFAIK this is perfectly valid. If you're seeing it on
*all* linux-kernel posts, it must something between you and vger doing
something silly..

I can't imagine that it would be too difficult to fix this "grepmail" program
to understand RFC822 properly :-)
