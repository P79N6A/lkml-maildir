I should have captured the debug printk I put in while testing.  I think 
the base address specified in the register was 0xf0000000, with a size 
of 256M marked enabled.  Arjan points out that this likely conflicts 
with other BIOS mappings, which is probably why I saw my machine hang 
when I tried to use it.
As for ACPI, I assume you mean the MCFG table?  I haven't looked at it, 
but the stock kernel complains about a lack of the MCFG range in the 
e820 table and subsequently disables mmconfig.
But won't the bridge register value control what actually gets decoded?  
If so, it sounds like this BIOS is buggy wrt mmconfig mapping in 
general; good thing I'm not using any PCIe devices I guess...
Thanks,
Jesse
