I know there isn't an absolute or stable ordering, but can't a temporary 
ordering be exported?
I was under the impression that the bk->cvs gateway squashed changes into a 
sort of order, way back when.  Admittedly this order wasn't stable, and new 
changes perturbed the whole list.  But just for debugging purposes with a 
"patch vs last -rc"?
