The last bit of the SuS text means:
pa <-- len --> eof <-> page boundary
Anywhere from pa to page boundary will generate SIGBUS.  This is a
rather useless definition no?  I think what they meant is:
"References within the address range starting on the first whole page
at least len bytes after pa shall result in delivery of a SIGBUS 
signal."
(I am assuming, of course, that pa is the result of the mmap call. If 
I'm
wrong please tell me, thanks!)
