There are two problems I see here.  First, there are several known ways 
to elevate privileges.  If a virus can elevate privileges, then it owns 
you.  Second, this is a multi-OS virus.  If you dual-boot into Windows,  
any ELF files accessible can be infected.  With this one, that isn't a 
prob, but when somebody codes in an ext2 driver to their virus, then 
we've got issues.
