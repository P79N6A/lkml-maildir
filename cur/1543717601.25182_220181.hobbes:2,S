We seem to be in a strange situation with respect to -funit-at-a-time:
    arch/i386/Makefile:
    # Disable unit-at-a-time mode, it makes gcc use a lot more stack
    # due to the lack of sharing of stacklots.
    CFLAGS += $(call check_gcc,-fno-unit-at-a-time,)
    arch/x86_64/Makefile:
    # -funit-at-a-time shrinks the kernel .text considerably
    # unfortunately it makes reading oopses harder.
    CFLAGS += $(call check_gcc,-funit-at-a-time,)
    arch/ppc64/Makefile:
    # Enable unit-at-a-time mode when possible. It shrinks the
    # kernel considerably.
    CFLAGS += $(call check_gcc,-funit-at-a-time,)
It looks like i386/x86_64 led the way to -funit-at-a-time, ppc64
followed, and then i386 had second thoughts because of increased stack
usage around the time of 4K stacks.
No other archs have a position one way or another.
