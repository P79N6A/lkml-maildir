Hi,
I've got some semi-embedded device here, a plain consumer-grade x86 with 
a VIA Nehemiah/Eden C7. After a while it just locks up, but neither is 
that deterministic nor does it give out kernel messages. CPU Frequency 
Scaling (which has been known to be a problem with this CPU) is already 
disabled.
I tried the "nohz" boot option to but until it finally hangs (which may 
take hours or days) I can't say for sure whether it works. It shall be 
noticed that watching the interrupts in /proc/interrupts (using 
/usr/bin/watch e.g.) shows that the IRQ0 interrupt does not fire at 100 
Hz, even with nohz, but more like 40-60 Hz. Also, the LOC line in 
/proc/interrupts is not increasing at all (presumable due to the APIC 
emulation).
dmesg:
[    0.000000] No local APIC present or hardware disabled
[    0.000000] mapped APIC to ffffb000 (011ec000)
[   39.983680] Local APIC not detected. Using dummy APIC emulation.
[   39.983426] CPU0: Centaur VIA Nehemiah stepping 08
[   40.545396] PCI: VIA PCI bridge detected. Disabling DAC.
[   40.545564] PCI: Bypassing VIA 8237 APIC De-Assert Message
[   41.803665] PCI: VIA VLink IRQ fixup for 0000:00:0f.0, from 255 to 5
Ideas be welcome, although I guess it's pretty much trial-and-error on 
my side :(
2.6.21 seemed to be a last known good one, though I'd stick with a 
distro kernel as usual.
thanks,
Jan
