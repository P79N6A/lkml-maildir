Hmm, I'll test those bk-snapshots and when it locks up, I'll try to 
access the pc form another machine. As I said it seems (when I wait long 
enough, within the first minute nothing in the log survives the reboot, 
probably due to reiserfs journalling) the log writes the oops I posted 
in the first message infinite times.

Maybe it is a nforce2 issue then. I think it is ACPI specific. I'll also 
try compiling latest kernel without ACPI and report back.
Thanx,
