Subject: [PATCH 11/55] KVM: VMX: Let gcc to choose which registers to save (x86_64)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

From: Laurent Vivier <Laurent.Vivier@bull.net>
This patch lets GCC to determine which registers to save when we
switch to/from a VCPU in the case of intel x86_64.
* Original code saves following registers:
    rax, rbx, rcx, rdx, rsi, rdi, rbp,
    r8, r9, r10, r11, r12, r13, r14, r15
* Patched code:
  - informs GCC that we modify following registers
    using the clobber description:
    rbx, rdi, rsi,
    r8, r9, r10, r11, r12, r13, r14, r15
  - doesn't save rax because it is an output operand (vmx->fail)
  - cannot put rcx in clobber description because it is an input operand,
    but as we modify it and we want to keep its value (vcpu), we must
    save it (pop/push)
  - rbp is saved (pop/push) because GCC seems to ignore its use in the clobber
    description.
  - rdx is saved (pop/push) because it is reserved by GCC (REGPARM) and
    cannot be put in the clobber description.
  - line "mov (%%rsp), %3 \n\t" has been removed because %3
    is rcx and rcx is restored just after.
  - line ASM_VMX_VMWRITE_RSP_RDX() is moved out of the ifdef/else/endif
