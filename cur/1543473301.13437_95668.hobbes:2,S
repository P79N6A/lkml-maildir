It appears 2.2.0pre1 (and 2.1.132 after I checked) has a problem recording
from a sound device after playing sound.  I'm pretty sure I didn't have
this problem in 2.1.131.
Playing sound and then trying to read from a sound device anytime after
that fails with "Device or resource busy".  I have to reboot to be able to
record again, and then I can't play any sound or else it breaks again.
I have a Soundblaster Vibra/16 PnP:
OSS/Free:3.8s2++-971130
Load type: Driver loaded as a module
Kernel: Linux jeffd 2.2.0-pre1 #1 Mon Dec 28 21:30:45 EST 1998 i586
Config options: 0
Audio devices:
0: Sound Blaster 16 (4.13) (DUPLEX)
I'm not doing anything special with the sound, just loading the module as
usual in the startup scripts, playing a sound (wavplay), and then trying
to record (wavrec).
