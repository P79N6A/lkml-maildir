Great!  Andrew, please include the appended patch in -mm.

Subject: [patch] x86_64, irq: use mask/unmask and proper locking in fixup_irqs
From: Suresh Siddha <suresh.b.siddha@intel.com>
Force irq migration path during cpu offline, is not using proper
locks and irq_chip mask/unmask routines. This will result in
some races(especially the device generating the interrupt can see
some inconsistent state, resulting in issues like stuck irq,..).
Appended patch fixes the issue by taking proper lock and
encapsulating irq_chip set_affinity() with a mask() before and an
unmask() after.
This fixes a MSI irq stuck issue reported by Darrick Wong.
There are several more general bugs in this area(irq migration in the
process context). For example,
1. Possibility of missing edge triggered irq.
2. Reliable method of migrating level triggered irq in the process context.
We plan to look and close these in the near future.
