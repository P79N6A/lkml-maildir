   Clearly FAQ means frequently asked, not answered. I can't find the
   appropriate patch, clearly some people regard allowing source routing to
   be a benefit.
Source routing exists in every single 2.4.x kernel every released.
What are you talking about?  There is no patch to speak of, it's
already there.
Franks a lot,
