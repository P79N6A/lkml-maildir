Well...
iirc, flush_anon_page() was introduced to fix non-working fuse on parisc,
which occurs because fuse wants to use get_user_pages() to read data from
the current processes memory space.
get_user_pages() contains a call to flush_dcache_page(), whose behaviour
is defined for shared mappings.  Anonymous pages are unspecified.  It
appears that flush_anon_page() was introduced to correct this oversight.
Looking at some of the other users of get_user_pages() which want to
access the current processes memory space, one finds the following:
some use flush_cache_page():
- binfmt_elf coredump
- ptrace (in arch code)
others don't:
- aio
- bio
- block (block_dev::blk_get_page seems to be for direct-io, there's problems
   reported with this on ARM)
- direct-io
- fuse
- vmsplice
So, anything except coredumps and ptrace are currently unsafe on ARM
without something being added to get_user_pages() to ensure coherency
of anonymous pages.
Given that we have reported corruption with direct-io, and debian bug
#402876 for nonworking fuse, it seems the correct thing to do is to
implement this function.
