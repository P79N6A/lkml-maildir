I agree.  The only reason for doing it that way was I couldn't think of 
any other approach.

That's a little too simple to work.  You can see from examining the 
existing code in bus.c and dd.c; there are places where the device needs 
to be locked but not the parent, places where the parent needs to be 
locked but not the device, and places where both need to be locked.
A slightly different way to accomplish much the same thing might be to
have a per-bus parent_needs_to_be_locked flag (or method).  It wouldn't be 
quite as elegant, though.
