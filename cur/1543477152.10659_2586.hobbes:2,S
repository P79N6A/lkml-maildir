	Please, take your advocacy and stuff it somewhere unpleasant.
This is the kernel list.  If you want to be a pain, take it up with
the list admin.  I doubt he wants to hear it either, but at least it'd
be a more appropriate forum.
	IIRC, they're using Zmailer.  I never liked Zmailer much, but 
I have run it and it performs at least as well as qmail is likely to.
