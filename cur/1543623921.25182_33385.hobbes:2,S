Hi Russell,
Yes. I'll change the serinfo line rev marking from 1.0 to 1.1 and label 
the  iomem value as "mem". If I remember correctly, kudzu detects that 
field by its delimiters, so it does not matter that we change the field 
label. It's probably easiest for me to verify by just trying it. If there 
is a surprise there, I will inform Bill Nottingham at Red Hat. 
Also, I'll verify that the port statistics flow unit runs for the iomem 
case.
Thanks,
Ed Vance
