I agree. i18n efforts won't help one iota because people just have
to know English in order to participate in l-k development.
They should be able to read _and_ reply_ to lkml posts,
and read and understnd code _and_ comments_.
Those who cannot participate in development because they don't
know English, won't get much help from some bits of semi-obsolete
Documentation/* being available. Ok, they will read it, then what?
How they are supposed to read the code? Write email? etc...
There is only one practical solution: learn the language.
It's not about *English* per se. It just happened so historically
that CS has originated in English speaking countries.
BTW, I learned it by reading sci-fi (Asimov's Foundation was the first thing),
and then lkml. :)
