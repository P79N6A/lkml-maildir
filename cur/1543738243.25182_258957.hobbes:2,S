My reason for asking is because having special parent pointers like that,
without corresponding children pointers, makes it impossible to guarantee
that parents aren't suspended until after their children when doing a
selective suspend.
What sort of special nodes are you thinking of inserting, and how would 
they affect selective suspend?
