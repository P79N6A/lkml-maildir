A good question.
My pid spaces while isolated from each other are connected together in
something that resembles the mount relationship when mounting a filesystem.
The init process of a child pspace is visible in the parent pspace,
by it's wid.  So you should be able to ptrace pid == 1.  The other
children remain inaccessible directly.
The idea was to do my very best to preserve the unix process tree when
constructing a separate pid space.
I have to admit I have not yet tested the ptrace corner case, or
digested all of it's ramifications.  Unless I have messed up somewhere
it should just work.
This visibility of the child tree by a single pid inside the parent
tree is why I think my approach doesn't suffer from most of the
problems a completely isolated pid space has.
In fact I would even be willing to look at it as a global but
hierarchical pid space if that proved an interesting case.
So you could have something like pkill(int sig, int which, char *pid_path).
Where pid_path is something like "1537/3/58", and which specified
what kind of pid you are talking about (thread, pid, process group...)
From a security stand point I want the option of a fully isolated
group of processes, so there is a possibility of keeping secrets from
the system administrator, but there is no reason that needs to be tied
to a pid space.
