please send delta patches instead - so that we can review the changes.

hm, what link warning did you get? Perhaps the following __cpuinit:
> -void __cpuinit setup_local_APIC (void)
does not mix well with an __init call:

and you hack it around by using a function pointer. Nasty and still 
buggy. The proper solution would be to mark enable_IO_APIC as __cpuinit 
too (or something like that).
