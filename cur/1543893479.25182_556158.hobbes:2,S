Hi Linus,
Please pull the 'drm-patches' branch from the drm git tree,
ssh://master.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/airlied/drm-2.6.git drm-patches
It contains a fix for a radeon 32/64-bit issue along with
hw support for some new Intel hw. Sorry for the lateness but I rely
on AGP PCI IDS being in the tree before DRM ids become useful.
Dave.

     The alignment on 64-bit is different for 64-bit values.

commit dc7a93190c21edbf3ed23e678ad04f852b9cff28
Author: Wang Zhenyu <zhenyu.z.wang@intel.com>

     drm/i915:  Add support for the G33, Q33, and Q35 chipsets.
     These require that the status page be referenced by a pointer in GTT, rather
     than phsyical memory.  So, we have the X Server allocate that memory and tell
     us the address, instead.
