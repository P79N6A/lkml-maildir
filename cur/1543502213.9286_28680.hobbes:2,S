I don't see that, but maybe you trimmed that out.

ARRRGH!!!!
Why is it that so many people have trouble with this concept?
First of all, an idle disk should be clean. If it isn't, then I ask
why your OS was wasting all that idle disk bandwidth? You will need
to flush the disk eventually, and the delayed IO may conflict with
future IO. You also tie up your memory with dirty pages. Ugh.
Second of all, "how can it flush the buffers ??" is a silly question
to ask when the disk is simply GONE. Answer: you don't. You junk them.
You free memory. You kill processes that were paged out to the disk.
If desired, one may add a hook for userspace "put disk back" dialogs.
This is very nice, but the basic behavior (free mem, kill procs) is
far more important. Last I heard, Linux got a D- on this, but I don't
want to risk a test right now. I'd most likely end up with a process
that can only be killed via "emacs /proc/kcore".
