Yes, actually I didn't check closely enough - arch/i386/kernel/acpi/* gets
built even if CONFIG_ACPI=n (!)
So the code will actualy compile and link OK if we do:
#ifdef CONFIG_X86_IO_APIC
extern void check_acpi_pci(void);
#else
static inline void check_acpi_pci(void) { }
#endif
But we'd need the acpi guys to tell us what's actually intended here,
please.  Does it make sense to be calling this function in a non-ACPI
kernel?
erk, your patch was against include/asm/...  - please don't do that - it
doesn't work very well if the patch receiver isn't using a setup-for-i386
tree.
