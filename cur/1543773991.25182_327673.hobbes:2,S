Reviewing my notes, there were a few subtle restrictions I forgot
(most of which originally suggested by Miklos):
(a) User's can't mount file system types not deemed "safe" (via  flag
in the file system type) -- this should help mitigate user's
exploiting bugs in existing file systems to interfere with the system.
 Judging when a file system type is "safe" is a nasty kettle of fish
though...
(b) Enforce NODEV along with NOSUID so that user-based synthetics
can't have device inodes with compromised permissions, etc.
