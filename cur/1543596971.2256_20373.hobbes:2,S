Hmm, I have a similar machine.
	K7-800, KT7 RAID, 2.4.5 kernel (was .0 at install time).

Err.. attempted to kill the idle task? Are you sure you don't have an
overheating processor?

SysRq will only help if the machine is responsive; and then even still
it's not going to correct issues like overheating processors and etc.

Shhouldn't be a problem with KDE. It *could* be with X, since (unless
you're using the framebuffer driver), it's directly accessing the
hardware.
Try starting up to a console and building a kernel with fb support, and
then use X through that and see if that solves any problems. (I haven't
had a single crash since; just that, for some reason, the sysrq key gets
disabled on startup and occasionally a framebuffer program will crash and
take my keyboard along with it. "Oops".)
