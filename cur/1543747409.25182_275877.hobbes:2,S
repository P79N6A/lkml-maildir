Thanks I have just updated fs/Kconfig and fs/cifs/xattr.c in the patch 
(actually in the cifs bk tree) to make the cifs POSIX ACL enablement 
dependent on cifs xattrs and to properly ifdef that function as it was 
in the CIFSSMBGetPosixACL
Today I had also made some minor error mapping changes on errors when 
various types of servers don't support POSIX ACLs (the servers did not 
return consistent error messages).
The CIFS code has had major recent update (most importantly the 
cifs_readdir rewrite which can be enabled in mm by "echo 1 > 
/proc/fs/cifs/NewReaddirEnabled", but also the POSIX ACL support which 
will work to Samba 3.10pre server, and also various misc fixes).
If the testing of the readdir change goes ok, and the misc. Windows and 
Samba testing continues ok over the next few days I would like to push 
this up (although I will remove the /proc/fs/cifs/NewReaddirEnabled and 
the corresponding old cifs_readdir, and the old CIFSSMBFindFirst and 
CIFSSMBFindNext routines when I get additional feedback from the mm tree 
and users running the equivalent cifs only patch).
Let me know if you find any additional problems.
Thanks,
Steve
