It has been done actually (in the intel ia32el JIT)

int 0x80 from 64bit will call 32bit syscalls. But some things
will not work properly, e.g. signals because they test the 32bit
flag in the task_struct. So you would still get 64bit signal frames.
There are some other such tests, but they probably wont affect you.
There were some plans at one point to allow to toggle the flag 
using personality or prctl, but so far it hasn't been implemented.
There is also no way to do 64bit calls from a 32bit executable.

64bit processes always get 64bit signals.
