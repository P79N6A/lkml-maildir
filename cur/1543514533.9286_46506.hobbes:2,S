utmp.ut_tv contains the time, as returned by gettimeofday(2), at which the
entry was created. This field is of type struct timeval, which contains two
fields: tv_sec and tv_usec. tv_sec contains the number of seconds since the
beginning of 1970 (GMT), and tv_usec contains the number of micro-seconds into
the second. The two together give a very precise timestamp for the entry.
