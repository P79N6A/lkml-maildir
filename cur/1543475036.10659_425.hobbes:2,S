I was using 2.2.0pre3 and it had DMA on for IDE, and my disk had serveral
failures because of this...  it whined, corrupted data, and accessed
really slow.  I'm compiling w/o DMA for 2.2.0pre4, as I write this.
I lost data and damaged some libs, this bug like sucks.  I started using 2.0.36
agian with PIO and it worked fine. I included my HD info in the attachment, 
thanks.
later,
Terry
