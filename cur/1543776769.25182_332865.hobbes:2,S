Yesterday evening, I used my time here at Debconf5 constructively!  ;-)

The sensor gives us two 10-bit AD values (corresponding to 0..1 volts on the
ADI chip), temperature (Celsius) and three status bits indicating:
  * lid open/closed
  * keyboard activity
  * nipple movement
On the X40 I borrowed (thanks Robert McQueen), at rest the outputs hover
around 512 (0x200).  Gravity is supposed to fall off in a sine-wave during
rotation, but I found that:
  theta = (N - 512) * 0.5
provides a surprisingly good approximation for pitch/roll values in degrees
in the range (-90..+90) so I think the sensor can do ~= +/-2.5G .

PS.  Coincidently, the name of the machine I borrowed is 'theta'...
