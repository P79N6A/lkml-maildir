those sound like productive ideas.  my concern was mostly for
practicality, in terms of what might be acceptible to those who are
worried about cache miss latency in production kernels.

certainly, the scheduler variables could be read out of a table during
processor detection, but we still have the problem of cache misses when
accessing the values.

that's what i was thinking, but i'm no expert.
