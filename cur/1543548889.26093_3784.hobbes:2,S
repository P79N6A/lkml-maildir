There's several of similar ones that have been renamed...
copy_to_user_ret
put_user_ret
get_user_ret
....
replace with 
if(get_user(..))
	return -EFAULT;
Along these lines, I've made a patch to lm_sensors so that they work
under test8. Patch is available at
http://www.haque.net/software/patches/lm_sensors-2.5.2
+2.4.0-test8-pre2.diff.gz
