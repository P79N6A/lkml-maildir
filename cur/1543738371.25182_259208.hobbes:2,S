If you want people to write workaround for functions that intentional
break applications depending on dysfunctional behaviour, you should
document it. You didn't, and therefore most applications will be broken:
google survey:
Results 1 - 10 of about 13,100 for udp select recv. (0.18 seconds)
Results 1 - 10 of about 636 for udp select recv o_nonblock. (0.16 seconds)
Results 1 - 10 of about 4,350 for select recv SOCK_DGRAM. (0.40 seconds)
Results 1 - 10 of about 685 for select recv SOCK_DGRAM o_nonblock. (0.39
seconds) 
I think nobody complaining results from nobody sending bad UDP packets,
and nobody sending bad UDP packets resulted from nobody complaining.
BTW: If you're breaking select() for blocking sockets, you can as well
return -EBROKEN. It's as close to the specification as waiting after
guaranteeing not to wait, but it will not result in hidden flaws.
