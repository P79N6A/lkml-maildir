Subject: [PATCH] 2.4.18 IDE corruption (update)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Hi...  This is a slightly "improved" version of the patch I first
floated last week (uses the spinlock now).
Summary: if a channel is shared by a DMA-using disk and a DMA-capable
CD, then loading the ide-cd or ide-scsi modules is liable to kill any
DMA transfers in flight on the disk while initialising the CDROM.  This
can cause serious disk corruption (has on my machine).
(Unless of course I've totally missed the point.)
Andre - can you check that this seems sane to you?
cheers
Neil
PS: bug also exists in 2.5.14, patch for that will go direct to Marcin.
