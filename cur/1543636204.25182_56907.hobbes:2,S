This is all done already for both LVM and EVMS snapshots.  The filesystem
(ext3, reiserfs, XFS, JFS) flushes the outstanding operations and is
frozen, the snapshot is created, and the filesystem becomes active again.
It takes a second or less.  Then dump will guarantee 100% correct backups
of the snapshot filesystem.  You would have to do a backup on the snapshot
to guarantee 100% correctness even with tar.
Most people don't care, because they don't even do backups in the first
place, until they have lost a lot of their data and they learn.  Even
without snapshots, while dump isn't guaranteed to be 100% correct for
rapidly changing filesystems, I have been using it for years on both
2.2 and 2.4 without any problems on my home systems.  I have even
restored data from those same backups...
Cheers, Andreas
