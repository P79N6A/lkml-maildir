Does anyone know how far along the lfs support in kernels 2.3.x are?
If I understand correctly all that is missing is file locking?
What would need to be added to get samba to work with this
lfs support?  Currently it detects that glibc supports it but
it still refuses to turn on the support...  May this be because of missing 
file locking functions?
Thanks,
Mike
