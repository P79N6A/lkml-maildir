    If no one reports bugs, they don't get fixed.
    Pavel Machek <pavel@suse.cz> is the swsusp maintainer, and should
have been CC'd on this, otherwise he'll probably never see it.
Linux-kernel is a busy place. :-)
    I know Mr. Machek wants swsusp bug reports filed in Bugzilla at
http://bugzilla.kernel.org
 , so you should do that, and then send a
follow up to this, CC'd to Pavel, with a bugzilla bug number.
CC'ing Rafael J. Wysocki <rjw@sisk.pl> as well probably wouldn't hurt.
