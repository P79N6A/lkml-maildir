Hi!
Acpi seems to create short-lived kernel threads, and I don't quite
understand why. 
In thermal.c
                        tz->timer.data = (unsigned long) tz;
                        tz->timer.function = acpi_thermal_run;
                        tz->timer.expires = jiffies + (HZ * sleep_time) / 1000;
                        add_timer(&(tz->timer));
and acpi_thermal_run creates kernel therad that runs
acpi_thermal_check. Why is not acpi_thermal_check called directly? I
don't like idea of thread being created every time thermal zone needs
to be polled...
