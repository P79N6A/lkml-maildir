> The patch reduces the numer of cylces by 25%
Er, I'm not getting that from just the numbers you show.
The total ave number of cycles in alloc_skb before is approx 268.
Total number of cycles in alloc_skb after is approx 468. 
So in order to reduce the total ave number of cycles, you
need __kfree_skb to reduce by more than approx 200. (Since
thats where you moved the code to).
So unless we see the total cycles in __kfree_skb, how
do we know? Or what am I missing?
thanks,
Nivedita
