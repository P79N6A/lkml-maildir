    Did the two debugging steps listed below.  Tried the nmi_watchdog=1 and
also the kdb debugger.  Unfortunately neither debugging feature gave me any
results.  When the machine locks up the result is total.  The nmi_watchdog
does not produce any output (after the lockup) and the kdb debugger fails to
load up when pressing the pause key (after the lockup).  I suppose this is
indicating a hardware issue.  However as I said before my burning test under
FreeBSD was successful.  No machine lockup.  And the last test (under
FreeBSD) burned in for two days.  I also tried removing a processor.  Just
as with the non-smp kernel, the lockup did not occur.  Tried single
processor mode with each processor, both were successful.  Also gave
2.2.17-rc2 a try, just in case.  Same result.  As it stands looks like I'm
still in the same boat.  8-(  Anything else I can do to debug this issue?
    By the way.  Are people:  Successfully using the Abit VP6 motherboard
under Linux?  Successfully using the ICP GDT7528RN raid controller under
Linux in an SMP system?  Successfully using an ICP GDT7528RN on a Abit VP6
motherboard?
