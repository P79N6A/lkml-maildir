I just said the same... Board is a SuperMicro H8DCE. From the FAQ section
at supermicro:
Question
I have an H8DCE motherboard with 4 x 1GB DIMMS installed but the amount of memory displayed in the BIOS is 3.865GB and in 64-bit XP is 3.76GB. I have the hardware memory hole option enabled in BIOS (rev 1.1a). How I can get the board to count the full 4GB of memory?
Answer
The total available size depends on the PCI-e card you are using; some high-end cards may occupy more memory. For example, with a Quadro FX4500 on the H8DCE with the memory hole enabled, 4GB memory will show up as 3728MB in BIOS and 3.64GB in Windows. For some low-end PCI-e VGA cards, it may show up as 4048MB in BIOS.
Why ? Who knows...
Chipset is all nVidia. I have a GeForce 8800GTX with 768 Mb. It eats up
400Mb.
This are my settings:
BIOS-provided physical RAM map:
 BIOS-e820: 0000000000000000 - 000000000009fc00 (usable)
 BIOS-e820: 000000000009fc00 - 00000000000a0000 (reserved)
 BIOS-e820: 00000000000e6000 - 0000000000100000 (reserved)
 BIOS-e820: 0000000000100000 - 000000009ffd0000 (usable)
 BIOS-e820: 000000009ffd0000 - 000000009ffde000 (ACPI data)
 BIOS-e820: 000000009ffde000 - 00000000a0000000 (ACPI NVS)
 BIOS-e820: 00000000fec00000 - 00000000fec01000 (reserved)
 BIOS-e820: 00000000fee00000 - 00000000fee01000 (reserved)
 BIOS-e820: 00000000ff780000 - 0000000100000000 (reserved)
 BIOS-e820: 0000000100000000 - 0000000147000000 (usable)
cicely:~# cat /proc/mtrr
reg00: base=0x100000000 (4096MB), size=1024MB: write-back, count=1
reg01: base=0x140000000 (5120MB), size=  64MB: write-back, count=1
reg02: base=0x144000000 (5184MB), size=  32MB: write-back, count=1
reg03: base=0x146000000 (5216MB), size=  16MB: write-back, count=1
reg04: base=0x00000000 (   0MB), size=2048MB: write-back, count=1
reg05: base=0x80000000 (2048MB), size= 512MB: write-back, count=1
This is with BIOS set for MTRR=Discrete.
With MTRR=Continuous, the mtrr's are simpler, a full range and a non-usable
hole. Which is better for Linux ? Many separate usable zones or one big zone
and an un-usable hole ?
BTW, mtrr formatting should be set to 0x%013lx000, to get them aligned with
nowadays memory amounts and similar to e820 map, 16 hex digits...

That's how they are plugged. The strange thing is that I filled the 1st
and 2nd slot (by mobo manual numbering), but dmidecode (BIOS?) thinks they
are 3rd and 4th. I don't know if it matters, probably not, but who knows...
This s***t of PC architecture is a Pandora's Box.

Nor I do...
