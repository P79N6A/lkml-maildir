the PII L1 cache is 16K and is 4-ways associative. This means the first
time we have a _chance_ to get cachelines kicked out is with 5 running
threads. There is no way you can place 4 task_structs to be misaligned.
And chances are almost zero to get a collision in the 512K+ L2 cache.

the (obvious i think) cost is in the indirection of the 'outsourced'
runqueue (well, scheduling) part of task_struct. Think of it this way: you
are basically doing the CPU's job, you are slightly fixing up the cache
architecture via introducing one more indirection (and quite some added
complexity).
