Softupdates were introduced to enhance performance by batching and
deferring disk operations.  I belive that initially, performance was the
only consideration in determining what actually got written to disk
when.  All the BSD/OS manuals I read at my last job warn against
enabling softupdates because data loss could occur.
Someone later realized that if you batch the disk operations in a way
that considers the atomicity of the filesystem operations being
implemented, softupdates can help *ensure* data integrity.  This is a
pretty recent development I think.
