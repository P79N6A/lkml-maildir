I just moved them from mousedev.c.

A simple userspace program or kernel handler can use BTN_TOUCH, and
it'll trade off configurability for simplicity. BTN_TOUCH will most
likely be present on all touchpads, touchscreens and tablets, too, so it
can be relied on as a generic feature. An advanced one can be
configurable to use ABS_PRESSURE with user defined thresholds.
Another of the reasons is that ABS_PRESSURE is hardware-dependent.
Different device types will need very different thresholds. With the
driver providing the thresholded value, a generic handler (like
mousedev) can work without external configuration.

No. It's a statement you're missing near the beginning of
joydev_connect().

It is possible. Maybe it's time now to define what event types each type
of device is supposed to have so that problems like this don't appear.

Hmm, I thought I've merged them in already, but obviously I did not.
Please resend them (rediffed if possible). Thanks.
