I guess in theory, you're right, though if a write() could succeed,
shouldn't select() say that it would?
And this assumes you're calling select() with a timeout.  In Apache,
the caretaker process wakes up periodically and polls the pipe with a
timeout of zero.  If it gets back the pipe is not writable, it kills
the process.  With this false negative situation, this is a bad thing.
