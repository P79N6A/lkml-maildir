I'm not sure where to report this....
In some sort of freak accident, I had a .s file in my source tree.
Whenever I did a build (make bzImage modules), the build process would:
(1) check out the corresponding .c file
(2) build the .s into the .o
(3) delete the .c file
Which I find odd, because:
(1) It never used the .c file, but checked it out anyway
(2) It _did_ delete the .c file, without using it
