How about 2 new PTRACE requests: PTRACE_SET_SIGIGN_MASK,
PTRACE_GET_SIGIGN_MASK
Both taking a "sigset_t *mask" as a parameter? The mask would be filled
by the debugger as usual using sigemptyset(), sigfillset(), sigaddset(),
etc.
Of course, the implementation would do error checking for legal values
of signals to mask, etc.
And this might require augmenting task_struct {} to store this mask,
kind of like last_siginfo which is already used by the
PTRACE_SETSIGINFO/PTRACE_GETSIGINFO ptrace requests.
