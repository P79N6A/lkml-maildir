People with different os'es prefer different adressing schemes.  It is
that simple, they don't want to use the scheme used in another os. Not
even if you think it is better somehow.  Most people don't want to deal 
with many os'es.
If you want to provide a multi-platform app with an acceptable user 
interface, then
you have to cope with the different adressing schemes.  If that is too much
work, consider taking patches from volunteers similiar to how the linux 
kernel
and many other big projects are managed.  I am sure you can get someone to
write "perfect" support for /dev/XYZ on linux for you, if you're willing 
to apply
such a patch.  And similiar for other os'es that diverge from your own 
preferred way.
