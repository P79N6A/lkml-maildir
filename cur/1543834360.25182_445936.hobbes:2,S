What is 2.6.17-test-1.29?
How do you know that 5d0cf410e94b1f1ff852c3f210d22cc6c5a27ffa caused this?

That code's a bit sick.  But nothing much has changed in there.

OK.
Are you able to test the below?  It should fix up the reporting.
Are you able to compare the present bootlog with the 2.6.17 bootlog?
AFAICT the "fixed it up" claim is simply untrue.  Odd.
