Err,
Isn't this WRONG.
Why is losetup considering the kernel at compile time?
Should it not be determining the kernel version at runtime and using the 
right structures then?
In which case it should have obtained a conceptual .../user/loop.h from 
a 2.4.x release and include a private copy
If 2.6.x is nice enough to provide an explicit .../user/loop.h then take 
a private copy of that into the losetup tree.
(Agreed that busybox may want to shrink as much as possible so allow 
build flags to say --with-24x-abi --with-26x-abi)
