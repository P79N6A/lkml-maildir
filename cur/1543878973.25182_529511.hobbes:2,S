Removing daemonize is a must have bug fix.  This falls short of that so
it is a good fix, but it doesn't solve the core problem that kernel daemons
are being assigned pids inside of child pid namespaces.
It doesn't solve the problem that some kernel daemons are using signals
to communicate with user space.
It doesn't solve the problem that we have to do a lot of massaging and
maintenance to get kernel threads from grabbing references to namespaces
and other kernel pieces they should not be grabbing.
