I'd agree.  I previously had a dialog with one of the BK developers
about making the email nicer (better subject, etc), but having it
dump the output to a file and fire up $EDITOR is probably a lot
better.  Maybe with a "bk send -e ..." or so.

Yes, I ended up doing the same "bk send - > cset.X.bk" instead of
sending directly, because I wanted to add in a patch description or
other text to the beginning of the email.
