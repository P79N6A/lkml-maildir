Why do you need to do this?  The clock select register is automatically
reset to zero after a hardware reset, and I don't see anything in the
16C950 data sheet which indicates that resetting the UART is necessary
before reading the ID bytes.
I have some 16C950 and 16C954 boards, and their of these lines are
necessary.

I'll send you my U.S. Mail address under separate cover.
