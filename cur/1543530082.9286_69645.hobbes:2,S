We already have it, it is called Documentation/xxx/yyy.txt.  Don't
bother creating a single file with every possible command line and/or
module option, you will never keep it up to date, especially with
external modules.  Each driver or subsystem needs its own doc file
saying what it does, what options it takes and what the more esoteric
error messages mean.  And that file should be maintained by the
developers of that section of the kernel.
