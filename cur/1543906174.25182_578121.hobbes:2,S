Are you sure you are using the latest version of the patch?  This seems
like a bug, if the device doesn't support HIPM or DIPM it shouldn't attempt
to use ALPM.  There was a check for this put into the patch on about the 
second or third version - maybe I'm not doing it right.

It works because after EH you've reset the port, and when you reset the
port you turn off ipm (note the value of SControl).  I left this the way
it was without attempting to renable link pm after a reset because I figured
if there was something bad happening and we needed to reset we should leave
ipm off.
As far as the failure you are seeing goes - this may not actually be a
hardware problem but just a case of us not understanding which bits we
need to clear out of the Interrupt status register once we enable
ALPM. The value of SErr indicates that this device has gotten PhyRdy - 
which is normal for power state changes, and the interrupt status indicates 
that a d2h FIS was received which is also normal - the TFES bit seems to be 
set - it may be that we need to modify the interrupt code to not only ignore 
PhyRdy when ALPM is enabled, but also clear out bit 0 - this is definitely 
something we can try.  But, meanwhile, please make sure you are testing 
with the latest version of the patches.

this looks like the same issue as above.

Make sure you are using the latest version of the patches - and that
the devices are not resetting themselves for some reason.  I don't see
how hotplug can work if we are indeed ignoring PhyRdy.

Not sure what part of disable_alpm you think is broken here - I see
the issue to be more likely in the interrupt handler.  I'll 
regenerate the patches today against the latest kernel and you
should rerun your tests just to make sure we aren't trying to fix
something that's already been fixed.
