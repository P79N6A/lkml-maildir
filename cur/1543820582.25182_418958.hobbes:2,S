Well I know that there are ways in Perl to overwrite arbitrary memory  
(it's considered a bug of a certain XS library, although it has no  
security implications because you could do the equivalent in Perl  
anyways).  I would assume that it's quite possible to do the same in  
bash with a specially formatted bash script.  Once you can scribble  
on arbitrary memory, you can load a compiled ELF loader and execute  
it without much trouble at all.  A signed perl binary would open a  
hole the size of a barn door in your scheme, I think.
