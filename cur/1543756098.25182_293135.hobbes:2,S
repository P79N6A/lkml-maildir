Hello.
I just tried (again) to get the most recent kernel version working on my
  laptop.  All is clear except for one small detail: the trackpad and mouse
  buttons don't work.  When using the eraser mouse, it moves around fine.
  When using the trackpad, the cursour jumps around as though it were using
  the wrong protocol.  Additionally, the mousebuttons either have no effect
  or cause the mouse to suddenly jump left.  The kernel log has tons of error
  messages (attached).
This behavior started occurring in 2.6.11-rc2; it works fine in 2.6.11-rc1.
  The behaviour here was listed with software suspend 2, but when I was
  testing it with -rc2, no software suspend patches were applied and I still
  saw the behavior.
Pertinent log data and config attached.
Thanks!
-Joseph
