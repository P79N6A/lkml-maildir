This sounds like a hardware problem -- none of the Athlons I'm using
experience such problems, but then I'm using boards with AMD, ALi and SiS
chipsets, but no VIA.  Try updating your BIOS and making your memory
settings more conservative.  If that doesn't help, I suggest replacing
your motherboard.
