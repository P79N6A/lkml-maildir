That's how it is.  The kernel drivers are to attempt to do their best to
give proper readings.  But if they don't, the library can apply
arbritary user-configurable adjustments.
I'd rather different attribute names like "raw_temp#" were used when the
adjustment thorugh libsensors is *required*, though.
