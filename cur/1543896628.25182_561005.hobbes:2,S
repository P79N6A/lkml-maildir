As we have previously stated we are not using pathnames for IPC.  The
use of pathnames for file access mediation is not a design issue that in
anyway prevents us from extending AppArmor to mediate IPC or networking.
The current focus is making the revision necessary for AppArmor's file
mediation at which point we can focus on finishing of the network
and IPC support.

AppArmor currently controls file and capabilities, which was explicitly
stated in the documentation submitted with the patches.  And it has
been posted before that network and IPC mediation are a wip.
