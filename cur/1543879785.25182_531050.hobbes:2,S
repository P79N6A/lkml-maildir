The license that protects the code we write is far from nonsense.

I suggest the first thing you do is contact the ZFS developers and
convince them to release their code under a license that's GPL
compatible, then we can start looking at a Linux port.

FUSE is nice for trying out new and interresting ideas in userspace -
it has its uses.

Can't tell you that, all I can tell you is my own oppinion.  I believe
ZFS for Linux would be interresting, if not for any other reason then
for compatibility. I'd personally like to see it - but, settle the
license issue first.
