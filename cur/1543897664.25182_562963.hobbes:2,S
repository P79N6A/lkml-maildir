I don't like random applications blocking my sound card.
Joe user wants to play sound, and he couldn't care less about "random IPC" or 
what-fucking-ever.
Dmix using the low quality sampling rate converter by default was another bad 
decision.
You are concerned about your precious audio quality? Me too. Most people, 
however, are using god-awful plastic speakers for twenty euros and shitty 
onboard sound chips. Sad but true.

ALSA appeared in 1999, KDE 2 with aRtsd (another catastrophic failure of 
technology) was released in october 2000.
Linux 2.6.0 seems to have appeared in 2003, so you are right for realistic 
values of "being around".

No, I kinda gave up on ALSA after reading its API (rather "functions 
that happen to be exported") documentation and kinda hoped it would go away 
ASAP.
[long rant on ALSA's developer "friendliness"]
If you want to see an example try this one:
http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/alsa-lib/hcontrol.html
or this one
http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/alsa-lib/group___h_control.html#g881a1bbb1e95b7bcadc5c2a88124c3d1
and now program against it! Having fun already?
Observe how "HCTL"s seem to be used everywhere, and the documentation is
"typedef struct _snd_hctl_elem snd_hctl_elem_t : HCTL element handle". Wow.
the struct looks like this:
struct _snd_hctl_elem {
        snd_ctl_elem_id_t id;           /* must be always on top */
        struct list_head list;          /* links for list of all helems */
        int compare_weight;             /* compare weight (reversed) */
        /* event callback */
        snd_hctl_elem_callback_t callback;
        void *callback_private;
        /* links */
        snd_hctl_t *hctl;               /* associated handle */
};
Notice how compare_weight should probably be called comparison_weight or 
priority, or relative_priority, or rel_priority or (...). The comment is 
worse than no comment. The author couldn't be bothered to use a dictionary? I 
think he wanted to tell us whether higher priorities have higher or lower 
numbers, but I still don't know which.
callback_private should be callback_opaque. The construct has always been 
called opaque pointer. If it was private it wasn't in this struct.
What about "must be always on top"??? Is it trying to tell us that you should 
not randomize the struct layout?
Bonus points for using abbrvns ("helems") in cmts, thy r mch mr nformtv tht 
wy.
There are two other structs of the same quality in the same header file
alsa-lib/control/control_local.h.
(control_local? As opposed to... remote? With a different interface or what? 
It doesn't make any sense.)
This mess probably couldn't have survived a real review by the kernel 
community.
For comparison, a comment taken from KDE's Phonon, copyright Matthias Kretz:
/**
 * This signal is emitted whenever the volume has changed. As the
 * volume can change without a call to setVolume (calls over dbus)
 * this is important
 * to keep a widget showing the current volume up to date.
 */
 void volumeChanged(qreal newVolume);
Spot the difference?
Kernel or user space, again:
Put everything in kernel OR userspace but not both. Either is OK, but the 
arguably more "modern" approach is userspace for error resilience and easy 
hacking (i.e. more features faster). Latency is an issue? - Well you can't 
play sound without userspace creating it so you're not adding any new 
problems.
Kernel only would have the advantage of being able to present "everything as a 
file" which is a good tradition. And no IPC.
ALSA took the disadvantages of both approaches and added the disadvantage of 
having to get two chunks of code to get it working. It takes a twisted mind 
to have two obvious right options and pick the third, obscure, and wrong 
option. So sampling rate conversion is hard ("too dangerous for the kernel"), 
boo hoo. It sure isn't more difficult to get right than a filesystem. Deal 
with it.
History of ALSA:
I examined the lkml archive 1999 to 2002 a bit. There was much talk about 
using all the DSP, bass boost, and other sundry hardware capabilities of 
cards just appearing at the time. The focus was on adding support for 
everything which
a) didn't happen (DSPs almost never get used to their full potential, I think)
b) somehow became uninteresting over the years. I don't want to "enhance" my 
sound with cheap DSP effects, I'll take a good stereo, thank you very much.
c) is only relevant for games because you don't want to use any effect off 
your card in professional audio applications
d) is plain stupid if you don't know what exactly you are going to need 
beforehand.
Sorry for the long rant - I've regularly gotten worked up about ALSA in the 
last few years whenever I got in touch with it. Mostly as a user and once as 
a potential client developer, but I was disgusted and turned away.

Random quote from the internet: "It all sounds perfectly reasonable until you 
have to explain to your granny why her PC sounded like shit over the last 
couple of months."
This can be fixed in the driver. It's called a quirk.

Yes. It just seems like nobody feels in charge to revisit the big picture 
issues where things really went wrong.
The last signals from Jaroslav Kysela I found on the net look like he is 
convinced of having created a great architecture, especially for professional 
audio applications(*). He is employed by Novell like Takashi, apparently, 
which won't make Takashi feel too adventurous, right? My guess is that 
Jaroslav is (officially or not) assigned to everything but drivers, and he is 
just not doing anything ALSA at all.
Meanwhile, ALSA continues to be crap and annoy people.
(*) ALSA is not lacking in raw capability, to be sure.

Maybe you could try a recent KDE or show me the command-line equivalents of 
Amarok or KPDF or Gwenview :)
