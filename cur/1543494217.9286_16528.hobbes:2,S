User programs do occasionally access memory, above and beyond what the
kernel uses...

Fine. Are you then claiming that it's impossible for a program to
touch a lot more than the minimum number of TLB entries, or are you
claiming that you think this is a big effect even for apache due to
the mandatory hits? The first is clearly not true (I write programs
which are extremely TLB-intensive); the second I have no idea about.
