Making that sort of thing available to userland is not a good idea, IMO.
Apart from anything else, I do NOT want to see Linux tools for upgrading
firmware etc. for exactly the same reasons I don't want to see Windows
ones: Why assume/require that I am running Linux or Windows?
A vendor supplied bootdisk is completely OS neutral, since the OS is out
of the equation. I could use that bootdisk whether my main OS is Linux,
NT, FreeBSD, Netware, whatever I want.

I'd rather keep it out completely.

It's dangerous - and the only legitimate use of this "feature" is one
which shouldn't be done from within Linux in the first place.
