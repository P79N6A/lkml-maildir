Your logs shows several
"Jul 18 14:58:33 localhost kernel: wvlan_cs: This is a PrismII card, not a 
Wavelan IEEE card :-( "
I have found that the best driver for PrismII cards is the orinoco, this is my
> lsmod
orinoco_cs              4328   1
orinoco                29408   0  [orinoco_cs]
hermes                  3328   0  [orinoco_cs orinoco]
ds                      6368   1  [orinoco_cs]
yenta_socket            8384   1
pcmcia_core            37984   0  [orinoco_cs ds yenta_socket]
...
I do also use USB, memory card with quite big transfers. And I have never seen 
this problem - I will look for it...
