What's happening there is that new CLIP connections start as normal
native ATM VCs, owned by atmarpd. When atmarpd clears them for IP
traffic, all the data that has been queued so far (i.e. any ATMARP
messages, and any IP - typically I'd expect to find a SYN there)
is removed from the native ATM VC's queue, and fed into the non-ATM
part of the stack, for de-encapsulation, etc.
Note that ATMARP will be delivered again to the "native ATM" VC's
queue, because that's how atmarpd receives ATMARP messages.
Figure 6 of 
http://www.almesberger.net/cv/papers/atm_on_linux.ps
shows the overall design (some details have changed since then,
though).
