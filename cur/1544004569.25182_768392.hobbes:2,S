As I mentioned there is a race here. :(
echo 1 > /memcg/memory.use_hierarchy
 =>if (list_empty(&cont->children))
                                      mkdir /memcg/0
                                       => mem->use_hierarchy = 0
       mem->use_hierarchy = 1;
Now it ends up with parent's use_hierarchy is set but its child's
use_hierarchy is not set.
