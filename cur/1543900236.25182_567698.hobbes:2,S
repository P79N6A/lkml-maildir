can you please send the part of /proc/bus/usb/devices concerning the
modem, while the modem is plugged in and (supposedly) using isoc mode.
If /proc/bus/usb isn't mounted, you can mount it like this IIRC:
	mount -t usbfs usbfs /proc/bus/usb/
Also, looking in the driver I see that if isoc mode is disabled you
should see one of the following messages:
	- setting interface to ?? failed (??)!
	- isochronous transfer not supported - using bulk
The first one may be a debug message, so you will not necessarily see
it depend on which level of kernel debug messages you have turned on.
(I have made some changes in my tree so that if you asked for isoc
transfer but get bulk then a message is printed).
Ciao,
Duncan.
