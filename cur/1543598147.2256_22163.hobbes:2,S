The 0.01 kernel is very crude. The keyboard and IDE drivers are
written in assembly. The memory management uses 1 page table for
everything, with segmentation used to split it up into 63 processes
of 64 MB each plus a 64 MB kernel space. Swap isn't supported, so
you'll need at least 4 MB of RAM to run gcc.

Red Hat is kind of new. :-) Use an old Linux distribution like MCC
or Tamu. Those came first, then SLS, then Slackware and Yggdrasil.
I gave you a URL for a slightly-hacked MCC that might do the job.
Remember to use the minix filesystem instead of ext2.
