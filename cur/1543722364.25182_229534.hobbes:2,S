It's a bit hard to generate out-of-order packets. You must have 2 links 
and some bakancing between them.
With sch_ooo you can test network protocols (including TCP) how they 
behave when out-of-order packets are received.
Another application is when you develop a network monitoring application 
(userspace) that must reports out-of-order packets.
