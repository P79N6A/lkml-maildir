exactly. Cruft hanging around does hurt in the 'generic' kernel. There is
'leaf' code where it hurts much less. Sure, we'd like to have clean code
everywhere, and a driver with a clean and recent codebase will get more
attention from the architecture point of view, but to the user, an
outdated but working driver is better than no driver at all.
