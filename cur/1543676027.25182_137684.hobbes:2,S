Yes, I didn't read the mailing list,
only the SBP2 page.
I did, now, read the thread "initial bus scan gone" and YOU refer this
as a known bug, not as a normal feature.
I may be lucky, but I never had a Ooops.
You're right on one point: I ALWAYS unload/reload the sbp2 driver.
I do this on a PC about once a day and had an 30 days uptime.
I don't do it on the Mac because it's a laptop and I usually
keep the disk mounted until I stop it.
I know that echo to /proc/scsi/scsi is needed for device REMOVAL,
but, as I said before, I NEVER needed it for device's insertion.
I use sbp2 devices every day for monthes, but never tried to know how it
worked since it was working well for me, so please don't tell me I never
used it...
Sorry to have talked to you, making you so angry,
won't disturb you again.
Time to close this thread, now.
