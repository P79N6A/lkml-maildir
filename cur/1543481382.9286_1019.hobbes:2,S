Disable CONFIG_SCSI_MULTI_LUN.
I once posted a patch to permanently disable it for ide-scsi, but apparently 
the Panasonic PD-CD drives need it. 
If you need multi-lun support, then I'm afraid you're screwed. What we _ought_ 
to do, I suppose, is disable multi-lun support on ide-scsi except for certain 
known drives.
