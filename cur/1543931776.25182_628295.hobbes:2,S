How so? idle notifiers should work for acpi idle too.

The original use cases were: 
- Accounting for idle time with stopped counters in oprofile and eliminate
the need for idle=poll.
That never was implemented unfortunately but would be still a worthy
feature I think.
- Perfmon for similar uses.
- noidletick -- my original noidletick implementation used the idle
notifiers similar to the s390 implementation. Obsolete now. 
Right now it is used for the machine check early notification, but I never
liked that (imho it just "fixes" a non problem only relevant 
in non realistic testing situations) and it would be fine to drop that one 
I think.  In fact I already made it a config in the patchkit to use the 64bit
mce code on 32bit too.
