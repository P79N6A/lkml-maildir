Subject: [PATCH] fix timer interrupts on NUMA-Q
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Since I turned on the IO-APICs on secondary quads, we are receiving 
timer interrupts on *all* quads, not just the first quad, each from their 
local timer chip. This causes time to progress far too rapidly ;-)
The simple patch below turns off the timer interrupts for IO-APICs other
than interrupt 0, and has been tested to fix the problem. As it switches
on clustered_apic_mode, it should be safe from hurting anyone else.
This fix is already in 2.4 - I'm playing catchup with 2.5 - the same patch
applies with just a line offset
Please apply ...
Thanks,
Martin.
