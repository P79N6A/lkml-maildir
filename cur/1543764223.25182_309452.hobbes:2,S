Hi all,
Can you tell me if there is currently support in the
kernel for HP's new LightScribe technology?
(
http://h30015.www3.hp.com/hp_dec/lightscribe/index_FL.asp
).
If there is not, are there plans for it?
Supposdly, you can burn DVD's or CD's, then flip the
media over and burn a label directly onto the CD or
DVD (no ink or toner...the laser burns it directly
onto the CD)
Thanks
Alan
