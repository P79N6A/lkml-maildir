of course, but that has to be maintained with locking too that
invalidates the simplicity of such approch. My point was that if we have
to play with the tasklet locking I guess we can as well drop the tasklet
from the queue and be more scalable so you can schedule thousand of
disabled tasklets at zero do_softirq cost (that was first Dave
suggestion).

yes, dropping it only after it run is an implementation detail, it can
delay a bit but it doesn't matter much. If we change the "disabled
tasklet" case (also for tasklet_kill, so you can kill also a disabled
tasklet) it may end to be more handy to also kill a scheduled tasklet
before it run, these will be more implementation details too and I agree
with you and Alan that here the semantics of running the tasklet before
killing it or not doesn't matter and should be considered undefined
behaviour. The only semantics of tasklet_kill are that the tasklet will
stop running after tasklet_kill returned and as Alan noted it depends on
the timing anyways.
btw, the patches I seen floating around checking the ->count before
tasking are racy.
