I wouldn't do that.  There are ACL patches out there, which seem
to be stabilising quite nicely.

I'd avoid that, since inodes get reused.  An attacker can start up
a priveleged binary, and suspend it until /etc/shadow gets the old
inode, and which point the app can start writing to the shadow file.
Better to store file permissions in files.
