I had the same problem. A quick sift through some of the relevant
headers leads me to believe that line 378 of loop.c should read:
		if (!inode->i_op->smap) {
(i.e. the "bmap" should be changed to "smap").
It now compiles properly, but I havent yet had a chance to test it
properly ('cos of the fs compile problems with the 2.3 series), so it
might go wildly wrong, but since the inode->i_op structure has no
member "bmap", but does have a member "smap", I think the chances of
it working are pretty high. I'm also surprised that no-one spotted
this one before the kernel got out. I would have thought it would be
wise to test the kernel compile with all (or at least most) of the
options enabled before releasing it (but what do I know ;)
