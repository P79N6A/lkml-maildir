Hi!
... Yes, it has to do with X.
When I have just booted and not started X a sleep 10 lasts 10 seconds.
But when I start X all the timings are messed up.
I still don't understand how X can make the clock running slow. I think
that the kernel should not allow programs to mess up the system timings.
Greetings, Michael
