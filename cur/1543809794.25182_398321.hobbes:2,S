Its only use right now is that on some arches we increment jiffies when
we detect lost ticks. This then forces xtime to be updated the
appropriate number of times.
It probably could be killed and the arches can just call do_timer() the
appropriate number of times. That might clean some things up. My TOD
work would also make it unnecessary.
