If the huge patch would support some way of redirecting the clearing of a
huge page then we could:
1. set the huge pte to not present so that we get a fault on access
2. run the bte clearer.
3. On receiving a huge fault we could check for the bte being finished.
This would parallelize the clearing of huge pages. But is that really more
efficient? There may be complexity involved in allowing the clearing of
multiple pages and tracking of the clear in progress is additional
overhead.
