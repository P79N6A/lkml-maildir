I meant with kexec and dump hook, there could be many more things can be 
done in addition to full core dump.  Initiating failover to other node 
will be one example.   Starting with this hook, there must be many good 
ideas.   So my idea is to make this hook general purpose, not for 
specific core dump tool.
