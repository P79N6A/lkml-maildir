A new and improved version for the 2.3.40 kernel, and with a patch
for util-linux-2.10e:
ftp://icaftp.epfl.ch/pub/people/almesber/misc/umount-root-5.tar.gz
The main improvement here is that it can forcibly chroot processes
sitting on the root of a file system. This avoids all the problems
with kernel threads that don't CLONE_FS from init, daemonize(), or
exit_fs(). (Adding exit_fs is dangerous - e.g. my change to lockd
in umount-root-4 would probably have crashed lockd when forking a
reclaimer.)
In order to keep umount semantics sane, I've added two new flags.
A patch for the latest version of util-linux teaches umount the
new tricks. I've also added an option -x to keep umount(8) from
trying to be clever. (E.g. translating /dev/hda1 -> / or
attempting turn an umount into a remount. Both are very bad ideas
in this particular scenario.)
This is probably the last version before I send it to Linus. So
please give it a good beating.

P.S. No, there's unfortunately no easy way to generalize this into
     an umount -f that can get rid of arbitrary processes.
     fuser -km  is your friend ...
