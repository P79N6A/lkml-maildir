Hi Matthew,
I have an Jenoptik JD 5200 z3 photo camera, which is supported by Linux.
Carsten Busse (who sent in the unusual_devs.h entry) has no problems with it.
I see 16K of junk at the beginning.
Is there a way to work around this somehow or should I claim firmware
error and send it back to the manufacturer?
Thanks & Regards
Ingo Oeser
