hi,
this was spotted by coverity (id #880).
We use simple_strtoul() earlier to initialize pe,
if the function fails, it also does not initialize it.
Therefore we should initialize it ourselves, so the check
in the OPT_TAGS case "if (pe && *pe == '/')" makes sense, and
actually makes the command line parsing more robust.
