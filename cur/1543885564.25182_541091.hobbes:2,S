Yeah, the intent of DWRR was to provide proportional fairness and rely
on the underlying scheduler to support interactivity. In a way, DWRR
ensures that each task receives its fair share, while the underlying
scheduler determines the right order to run the tasks. Since SD is
structurally similar to the stock scheduler, DWRR should co-exist with
it easily. Co-existing with CFS requires more work, but I think the
round-robin mechanism in DWRR could be applicable to CFS to facilitate
cross-processor fairness.

The disadvantage of DWRR is its potential overhead and the advantage is
it can provide stronger fairness. If we have 2 processors and 3 tasks,
DWRR ensures that each task gets 66% of the total CPU time, while
smpnice would keep two tasks on the same processor and the third one on
another. I did an analysis and showed that the lag bound of DWRR is
constant if task weights are bounded by a constant. On the other hand,
the cost DWRR pays is that it requires more task migrations. I tested
with a set of benchmarks on an SMP and didn't see migrations were
causing much performance impact, but this is certainly a big issue for
NUMA.

PS. I'm now porting the code to the latest kernel and will post as soon
as I'm done.
