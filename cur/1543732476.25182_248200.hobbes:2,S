Sure, but there are plenty of existing interfaces that you could 
emulate.  One could make a small library to use a transactional 
filesystem to implement the Berkely DB interface (libdb) for example.  
So on filesystems without such support your app could use the regular 
userspace database, but on a transactional filesystem it'd just use 
regular files, which would simplify database management and likely 
increase performance over the userspace-only version (libdb is pretty 
slow).  In terms of functionality it'd just be a drop-in replacement, 
just like math libraries that use MMX/SSE when available.
