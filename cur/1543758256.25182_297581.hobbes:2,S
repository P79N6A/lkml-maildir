You call it "breakage" because you have a relatively dogmatic view 
regarding the selection of user visible symbols.
Other people care more about the usability of the kernel config system, 
and therefore a select of one of the I2C* options is quite common from 
both outside and inside the i2c subsystem.
There are two possbile situations:
- these RTC drivers are nice add-ons that could be shown if all
  required I2C* options are already enabled
- these RTC drivers are pretty essential and should really be enabled
  on the platforms they are for
Which of these two cases describes the situation of these RTC drivers?
