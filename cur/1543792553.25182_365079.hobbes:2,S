I doubt it.

First make sure that you do not inherit a signal mask where SIGALRM is
blocked, and that you do not inherit a SIG_IGN signal disposition for
SIGALRM either.
Cat /proc/pid/status and look for the SigBlk line (blocked signals)
and the SigIgn (ignored signals).  SIGALRM is 14, look for bit 14,
that is 0000000000002000.  This bit should not be set.
