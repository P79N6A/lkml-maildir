Depends on what you call big :) The one I ran on is a 2-node NUMA
16(32)-way with HT. I can't find anything bigger than this
in our server farm. On a 8-way ppc64 box too, there was no difference
at all.
Can you think of some non-microbenchish workload with more open/sec ?
I privately pointed out this thread to John Hawkes from SGI to see
if they care about the potential issues. In the mean while,
I will investigate some more.
Thanks
