Cases rather than case, sadly. Determining whether the hardware is on AC 
or not tends to be much more awkward than you'd think. On HPs, it seems 
to be done by making a specific call to the embedded controller. This is 
very model specific, whereas the brightness values aren't. It's also 
likely to go horribly wrong if the hardware is trying to access the 
embedded controller at the same time. Realistically, it's impossible 
without making the driver depend on ACPI and exporting acpi_ac_get_state 
from the ACPI layer, which would be a shame since the rest of the 
functionality isn't ACPI dependent at all.

I think providing a consistent interface for what information we can 
provide is worthwhile.
