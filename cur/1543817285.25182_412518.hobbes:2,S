Thanks for the information.

Well, it would cause less confusion. It seems that ~90% of rebuilt files
are due to the following makefiles where full paths to includes are
specified:
./drivers/media/video/cx88/Makefile
./drivers/media/video/Makefile
./drivers/media/video/cx25840/Makefile
./drivers/media/video/saa7134/Makefile
./drivers/media/video/em28xx/Makefile
Any objections to fix these?

Carl-Daniel
