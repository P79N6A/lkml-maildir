It only matters if the lock is meaningful over an involuntary reboot (aka
crash). Usually it isn't. So yes, the fsync() is usually not necessary.
Sometimes the lock file may contain real data that is meaningful for 
recovery, though. The pid generally isn't, but it could point to a log 
that describes what the thing was about to do. Or it could just be helpful 
on next reboot when you have a stale lockfile, and you want to match that 
lockfile to any syslog messages or similar.
