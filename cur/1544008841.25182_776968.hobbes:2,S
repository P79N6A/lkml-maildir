Or use inline routines rather than micros for proper typechecking.  
(Although that's not tremendously important, since the buffers are all
unsigned byte arrays.)  Honestly, which is easier to read and
understand, this:
		lba = load_be32_noalign((__be32 *)&fsg->cmnd[0]) & 0xffffff;
or this:
		lba = get_be24(&fsg->cmnd[1]);
-- especially considering that the value being loaded is defined in the
spec as a 3-byte field starting in byte 1 of the command buffer?

IMO it's a lot worse than
	put_be32(&buf[0], curlun->num_sectors - 1);
	put_be32(&buf[4], 512);

In the end, it comes down to a matter of taste.
The aligned versions could be used in a few cases, but on the whole the 
advantage would be negligible.  I say it's not worthwhile to worry 
about using them -- which is consistent with the behavior of the 
original code.
