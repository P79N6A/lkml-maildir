Subject: problems with IRDA under 2.4.18 (SUSE)

Dear kernel developers,
I suspect that there might be some bug in the IRDA functionality
in 2.4.18. The IRDA-ircomm communication already worked on my UMAX
notebook - Motorola phone under the original 2.4.16 kernel from SUSE7.3
distribution, but after update to SUSE8.0 with their original 2.4.18 
kernel I do not get even irdadump working. The procedure I used was the same
in both cases and followed the Infrared-HOWTO.
I do not have an idea where the bug might be, it can be in the userspace IRDA utilities as well. I just saw that there were some changes in the kernel
in the IRDA part between 2.4.16 and 2.4.18 and maybe something went wrong.
Best regards,
Jiri Pittner
