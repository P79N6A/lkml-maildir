Didn't get any replies in linux-ide so I'll try here.
Can anyone tell me if/how one could add device support for the sis180 
chipset pata ports to the sis5513 module? I've tried adding this as 
others have said it works for the 965 southbridge,
if ((trueid == 0x5518) || (trueid == 0x0180)) {
but it stll doesn't see a real sis180 on a Jetway S755MAX MB.
Here's the device info.
