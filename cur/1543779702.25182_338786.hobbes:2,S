Sorry about the noise. Dann Frazier and I ran through a bunch of patches
from 2.6.12-stable to see which onese were appropriate for Debian's
2.4.27 and 2.6.8. This patch did indeed get backported to 2.6.8.
And in the course of juggling all the patches I made a mistake and added
it our 2.4.27 patchset and subsequently sent it here.
cx88 indeed is not in 2.4 and the patch is completely invalid for that
tree. Please ignore :)
I do have few other patches from 2.6.12-stable that do seem appropriate
for 2.4, but after this mess up I am waiting for all the builds to
finish before forwarding stuff on.
