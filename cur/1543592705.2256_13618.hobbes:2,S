Subject: Current tulip driver from 2.4.5 is plain broken

I mentioned that before but this should be stated clearly.  As far as I
am concerned "Linux Tulip driver version 0.9.15-pre2 (May 16, 2001)",
as used in 2.4.5 - and other kernels - is totally buggered.  It comes up,
and ethernet interfaces can be configured, but does not matter how I am
playing with options I cannot get a single packet through.
Replacing it in 2.4.5 with "Linux Tulip driver version 0.9.14d (April 3,
2001)", which I have handy, restores sanity immediately and a network
simply works without any heroic efforts.
My NIC is "Digital DS21143 Tulip rev 65 at 0x8800".  BTW - a version
"tulip-1.1.7" from sourceforge behaves exactly like 0.9.15-pre2.
This is an output of 'tulip-diag -af' from a working setup:

 Port selection is 10mpbs-serial, half-duplex.
 Transmit started, Receive started, half-duplex.
  The Rx process state is 'Waiting for packets'.
  The Tx process state is 'Idle'.
  The transmit threshold is 72.
  The NWay status register is 000052ca.
  Internal autonegotiation state is 'Negotiation complete'.
And this what shows up when I am trying to use "the-new-and-improved":
