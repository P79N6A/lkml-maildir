I have to ask...
What sorts of performance characteristics are needed here?  The reason
that I ask is because putting a straight synchronize_qrcu() into a
workqueue (or something similar) and then using a timer to provide
any needed wakeup seems a lot simpler than rearranging the innards of
synchronize_qrcu().
(Yes, I am feeling cowardly.  Why do you ask?)
