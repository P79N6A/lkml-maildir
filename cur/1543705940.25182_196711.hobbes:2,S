oops, i thought i told you that my blocksize is exactly 4k - sorry
btw, i hit this bug again a few days after i reported it
one time it went crazy and oopsed 8 times in about 8 minutes
i think it only happened when the system was swapping heavily
(swapd creating new swapfiles as fast as it could) and i manually
swapon'ed another (bigger, ~50MB) swapfile by hand
