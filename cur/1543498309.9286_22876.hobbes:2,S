Ultimately I'd like to see proper volume-based mounting. Not UUIDs (as
Linus said to me privately, 128 bit numbers are ugly), but proper
names. Like "root", "usr", "local", "home", "data", "tmp", "swap" and
so on.
I'm still debating with myself whether volume names should be
registered with devfs. In other words, the code that determines volume
names registers them under /dev/volumes/

Are your concerns related to the devfs concept or to the particular
naming scheme?
