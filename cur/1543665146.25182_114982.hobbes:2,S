No, sorry. Bad choice of words.
The traditional "synchronous wakeups" as used by fs/pipe.c is a hint to 
the scheduler that the waker will go to sleep.
And no, that's not the hint I'm using at all. I'm only interested in 
"process-synchronous", since if the wakeup isn't process-synchronous then 
"current" doesn't make much sense to me.

Note that "in_interrupt()" will also trigger for callers that call from
bh-atomic regions as well as actual BH handlers. Which is correct - they 
are both "interrupt contexts" as far as most users should be concerned.
The unix domain case may well be bh-atomic, I haven't looked at the code. 
I'm pretty much certain that the TCP case _will_ be BH-atomic, even for 
loopback.
David?
