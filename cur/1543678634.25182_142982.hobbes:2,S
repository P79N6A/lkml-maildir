It's funny -- all of this political talk going on about the effect of 
Open Source on commercial software.  Well, for some people, writing open 
source software may have political motivations, but for an even greater 
number of people, writing open source software is something they do 
purely for personal enjoyment.  In terms of motivation, this is no 
different from wood working or launching pumpkins.
The great thing about the open source community that exists is that 
there is a huge body of work out there that you can borrow from in order 
to make getting your enjoyment easier.
How many of you kernel developers out there hate coding but work on the 
Linux kernel just for the sake of beating Microsoft?
For many of us, this is just a hobby.  Yeah, it's awesome that other 
people can benefit from it and use it commercially, but it's just 
something we do for fun.
