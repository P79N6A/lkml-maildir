This release is code named "Ginseng" in honor of the healing
properties it will have for your machine:
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/davem/TIGON3/tg3-0.94.patch.gz
Healing list:
[FIX] Some DELL variants not monitoring PHY link status properly.
[FIX] RX ring could still empty and hang chip.  TX/RX paths completely
      revamped.  People please beat on this sucker hard.
[FIX] Jumbo RX buffer sizing wrong.
[FIX] RX ring replenish threshold settings were inaccurate.
[FIX] VLAN layer forgets to set dev->last_rx
[FEATURE] Syskonnect and Altima AC1000 Tigon3's supported.
[FEATURE] Full 5703/5702fe/5702x support.  Please test if you have
	  these chips since we don't :(
Have at it.
How does this thing perform for people?  In particular lmbench
'bw_tcp' and 'lat_tcp' numbers over gigabit on beefy hardware are
considered very interesting...
