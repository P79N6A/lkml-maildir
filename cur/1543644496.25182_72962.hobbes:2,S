   Even on ia32 you'll need 8 bytes if the controller is operated in DAC
   mode (which is what you want for a machine with >4GB of memory), no?
Right.  But if we know the top 32-bits will always be zero (f.e. if
CONFIG_HIGHMEM is disabled on x86) one might want to optimize this
to avoid the first 32-bit store.
