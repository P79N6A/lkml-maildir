How large? This patch is rather small? Where can I find it?

Replace this disk or the sata controller maybe, but usually people don't want 
to replace a big cluster, even if it is already 3 years old, this has to wait 
at least another 3 years.
The problem came up, when 200GB drives were replaced by *newer* 250GB drives 
(well maybe not the newest, no idea were they came from).
Anyway, I'm testing for more than 24h already and didn't observe any data 
corruption as without the patch. I know this is only an obersavation and no 
definite prove...
Also, this is with 3114, maybe this chip behaves a bit different than 3112?
Thanks,
Bernd
