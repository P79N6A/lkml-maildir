Its called current. We write a lot of current->state type things where it makes
a lot of sense. Being a define is ugly because it hits struct fields. Being a
global is sane. Its also something that is inbuilt into every driver and every
book or article on linux driver/kernel stuff. Changing it would be extremely
bad.
