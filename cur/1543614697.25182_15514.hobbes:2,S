  Do you have RAID1 on the disks ?
  Apparently "noapic" option helps, e.g. breaking the SYMMETRIC part of SMP.
  You may also try "nmi_watchdog=1", if you have serial console attached
  to the box for kernel message logging (and command).

   Yes, looks familiar.  My hangups have been during high disc activity too.
   My box is located into a place into which I have difficult access, e.g.
   I can't use it to collect the debug data, and do magics (press reset)
   to recover.
