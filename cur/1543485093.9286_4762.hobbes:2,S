With the 2.2.1s bttv, you should start alevt with the -oldbttv option.
Without this option, you'll see the running headers but it's pure luck
to get a complete page.  With that option, it should be as fast as your
normal TV and after a while (when the cache is filled) you should get
each page instantly.

Hmm.. This is new.  Either something was changed in the ac-patches or in
xawtv.  But it's not so bad.  There are occasional crashes/frequent hangs
if /dev/video and /dev/vbi are used at the same time.

I don't know, if the MIRO has a SAA5249, but every Bt8xx card can do
teletext.  A real decoder chip may use less cpu-time, but it isn't
necessary.
Ciao, ET.
