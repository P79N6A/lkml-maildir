Both are incorrect.  When CONFIG_PREEMPT=n we have no support for
determining whether schedule() may be called.  The calling code has to sort
out its stuff on its own.
<greps for preempt_count>
The LEDs code seems to be the sole offender.  print_vma_addr() might be
wrong too, but Ingo did it, and perhaps he knows that all code paths which
call print_vma_addr() from deadlockable contexts have already called
inc_preempt_count().  But is that true for all architectures?

omigawd, what have we done, and how can we fix it? :(
