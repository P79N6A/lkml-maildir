Seems that way.
It also seems that yesterday I sent you the URL of two patches:
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/2.4/2.4.17-pre1/vm-fixes.patch
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/2.4/2.4.17-pre1/elevator.patch
and I explicitly asked you to report on the result of applying them?
If you apply them, you'll find that the problem goes away. If you're
using ext3, you'll get better results if you mount with the `noatime'
option.
So please - test the patches, report the results.  It's how things
work around here.  Sometimes :)
Thanks.
