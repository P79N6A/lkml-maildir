No, it also survives as an add-on tarball for the standard kernel:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/drm-4.0.x.tar.bz2
Let me dig through my old mail so I can quote Linus on this... Here's
what he said in his Linux 2.4.8 announcement message (Subject
"Linux-2.4.8", sent on August 10th of this year):

The impression I get (for 2.4) is that DRM 4.1 comes standard but you
should still be able to use 4.0 if you want, via that tarball.
