I've been reading through the latest kernel traffic trying to find a
definitive answer on this but haven't had any luck.  Here's the
questions:
1) does linux 2.4 support >2GB files with ext2 on rh6.2 by just loading
   the new kernel?
2) if not, what is required to support larger files on i386?
Thanks,
Mark
