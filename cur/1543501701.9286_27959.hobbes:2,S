True - and I for one would expect the diskette to get destroyed
anyway, in these circumstances. Certainly the second option would be
my preference though...

Nodz...

That sounds like the argument that because Linux is best installed
in an ext2 partition, it can be installed without destroying one's
Windows setup, since ext2 must be a subset of FAT32 !!!

The only diskettes whose contents I keep permanently are master
diskettes for software I've obtained at some time or other, and other
than that, I expect my floppies to be regularly reformatted between
FAT12 and ext2 as needed...

Not necessarily - the FAT12 filesystem is wonderfully resiliant in
many ways, and it's quite legitimate to format what's really a 1.4M
diskette with 40 tracks, 1 head and 8 sectors per track., thus giving
it a capacity of 160k. Generate a FAT12 header that says there's only
a single file on the disk, its name being PANIC.IMG (or whatever), and
both FAT tables indicating that it occupies the entire disk, then
write out that header followed by however much messages fit in the
remainder and you're laughing.
Since we're talking of Linux and it requires at least a 386 to run, we
can probably assume a basic minimum spec of 2 heads and 9 sectors per
track, and either 40 or 80 cylinders as appropriate (I believe there's
a BIOS call that can return that information), so make that either
360k or 720k of messages as appropriate.
*** Time passes ***
Oooooopppsss......
I hadn't realised this didn't get sent - apparently, I lost my link
around this point, so it stayed waiting for me. I've written a proof
of concept of the above since I penned it...
Best wishes from Riley.
