Hi,
The inotify patch just added a line
+				fsnotify_open(f->f_dentry);
to sys_open, but it missed the x86_64 compatibility sys32_open()
equivalent in arch/x86_64/ia32/sys_ia32.c.
Andi, perhaps it's time to factor out the guts of sys_open from the flag
munging to keep as much of that code as common as possible, and avoid
this sort of maintenance problem in the future?
