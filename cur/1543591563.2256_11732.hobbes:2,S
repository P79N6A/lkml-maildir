Hello all.
I have a little problem, I have an Pentium 266Mhz linux box with kernel 2.4.2 
with 64mb of memory, After about an 1 day of running i get this msg loged in
/var/log/messages
kernel: TCP: too many of orphaned sockets
after that noone can telnet to the box or anything couse of the sockets 
beeing all used. I have to reboot then its ok again for about a day, and Im 
not running many processes
if i do netstat i get about 100 connections...
why are all the sockets used?
If i do the
cat /proc/net/socketstat
sockets: used 405
TCP: inuse 102 orphan 0 tw 0 alloc 156 mem 2
UDP: inuse 12
RAW: inuse 0
FRAG: inuse 0 memory 0
So if i look at socketstats more often the "sockets: used XXX" the XXX number 
is going only up! and never down.
What should i do to fix this?
Where is the problem?
Thank you all for your help!
