All this just to avoid that symlink? What is so wrong with that? Yes,
the ugliest thing is some additions to top-level Makefile but I think
this the reason those prepare{1,2,3....} targets were meant for.

Mailed 'compressed-test' module along with usage to Bret (CC'ed to
you, Richard, linux-kernel). This makes it very easy to test this LZO
code.
Thanks for comments.
