Ugh, you're right. Doing a reasonably normal build without modules nets us
	  205K mm/built-in.o                                            
	  336K kernel/built-in.o                                            
	  451K sound/built-in.o                                            
	  864K net/built-in.o                                            
	 1016K fs/built-in.o                                            
	  2.3M drivers/built-in.o                                            
which is kind of scary. Of course, in the drivers, about half a meg of
that is just the PCI name translation, so some of it is trivial (and
thrown away at boot), but most of it is just spread out in fat all over. 
It's hard to go on a diet.
