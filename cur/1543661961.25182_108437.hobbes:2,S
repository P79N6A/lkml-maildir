Yes it is very clear from the numbers that your tree is more than
150% the speed for reads. As I said I don't know too much about
SCSI, but it is very interesting that writes don't get a noticable
improvement although they would be using the bigger request sizes
too, right? Something is causing this but the cpu, bus, wire
overhead of using small requests does not seem to be it.
