Hello Linux World,
Is there a way to add a generic and transparent presenation layer in the
path of TCP/IP packets. I am speaking about something probably in the
path between the user space mechanims (send/recv/read/write) and the
actual sock_sendmsg/sock_recvmsg (and their proto counterparts).
Thanks for all replies.
Best regards
Khaled
