Subject: netconsole: fix soft lockup (2.6.21) and memory leak when removing module
From: Jarek Poplawski <jarkao2@o2.pl>
#1
Until kernel ver. 2.6.21 (including) cancel_rearming_delayed_work()
required a work function should always (unconditionally) rearm with
delay > 0 - otherwise it would endlessly loop. This patch replaces
this function with cancel_delayed_work(). Later kernel versions don't
require this, so here it's only for uniformity.
#2
After deleting a timer in cancel_[rearming_]delayed_work() there could
stay a last skb queued in npinfo->txq causing a memory leak after
kfree(npinfo).
Initial patch & testing by: Jason Wessel <jason.wessel@windriver.com>
