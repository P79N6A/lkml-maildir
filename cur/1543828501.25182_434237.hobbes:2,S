Nick,
Here are some requirements we(Resource Groups aka CKRM) are working
towards (Note that this is not limited to CPU alone):
In a enterprise environment:
 - Ability to group applications into their importance levels and assign
   appropriate amount of resources to them.
 - In case of server consolidation, ability to allocate and control
   resources to a specific group of applications. Ability to 
   account/charge according to their usages.
 - manage multiple departments in a single OS instance with ability to
   allocate and control resources department wise (similar to above
   requirement :)
 - ability to guarantee "time to complete" for a specific user
   request (by controlling resource usage starting from the web server
   to the database server).
 - In case of ISPs and ASPs, ability to guarantee/limit usages to 
   independent clients (in a single OS instance). 
 - Ability to control runaway processes from bringing down the system 
   response (DoS attacks, fork bombs etc.,)
In a university environment (can be treated as a subset of enterprise
requirements above):
 - Ability to limit resource consumption at individual user level.
 - Ability to control runaway processes.
 - Ability for a user to manage resources allocated to them (as 
   explained in the desktop environment below). 
In a desktop environment:
 - Ability to control resource usage of a set of applications 
   (ex: infamous updatedb issue).
 - Ability to run different loads and get the expected result (like 
   checking emails or browsing Internet while compilation is in 
   progress) 
Generic:
Provide these resource management capabilities with less overhead on
overall system performance.
regards,
chandra
