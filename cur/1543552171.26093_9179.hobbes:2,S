I've proposed this in the past, but there you refused on the grounds
that it breaks assumptions in the VFS. I'm otherwise happy with this
sort of thing. It ensures both shared mmap() and cache consistency.
The only problem I can think of would be for dirty pages that haven't
yet been msync()ed, however I'm far from being competent to evaluate
any side-effects on the VM.

This is already in place.
