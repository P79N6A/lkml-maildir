well, parsing pnp would be easiser because the id is always 7
letters, so no need for that...

no, not modules.alias but the old modules.isapnpmap, which depmod
should generate, too.

hmm, i thought it checks the device ids but apparently it's not.
IMO, this is a bug, because there are cards with the same card id but
different device ids. (e.g. sound/isa/cs423x/cs4236.c)
in the logic above, only the first matching entry is checked and it
results in the failure of probing.
Adam, what do you think?

yes, sure, the alias stuff should reflect to the driver's probing logic.
well, in the case of hotplug, the device ids aren't meaningful,
because (so far) there is no confliction between drivers with the same
card id.  i mean, in theory, it's possible that the driver A supports
only ids X:Y while the driver B X:Z (where X is the card id, Y and Z
are device ids).
