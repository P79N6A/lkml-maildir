Yes, I have read that. I also have one board running without problems and 
45 boards which have the problem. The running one has been bought over a 
year ago. The 45 boards which are not running have been bought a few weeks 
ago.
So I think they have made a bad change to the board design since the 
prototype board which is running perfect or there is a bug in the CPUs 
(maybe memory controller, or hypertransport). In the running board CPUs 
with stepping 1 are installed, the not running ones have CPU stepping 10.
Bye,
