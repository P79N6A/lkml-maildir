The resource pool indeed provide extra robustness, the initial pool size will
be equal to min_count + grow_count. If the pool object count goes below
min_count, then pool grows in the background while serving as emergency
pool with min_count of objects in it. If we run out of emergency pool objects
before the pool grow in the background, then we go to OS for allocation.
Similary, if the pool objects grows above the max threshold,
the objects are freed to OS in the background thread maintaining
the pool objects close to min_count + grow_count size.

We need several objects of size say( 4 * sizeof(u64)) and reuse
them in dma map/unmap api calls for managing io virtual allocation address that
this driver has dished out. Hence having pool of objects where we put 
the element in the linked list and and get it from the linked list is pretty
fast compared to slab.

We had this kmem_cache_alloc() with mempool concept earlier and Andi suggest to 
come up with something pre-allocated pool.  
Andi, Can you chime in please.
