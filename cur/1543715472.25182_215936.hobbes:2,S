We use a patch for Lustre which solves this problem.  When there is
a lookup-by-inum done on the server there is the possibility to get a
DISCONNECTED dentry as you say.  However, if we ever do another lookup
on this inode we verify that either this is a disconnected dentry and
return the existing dentry, or if it is a connected dentry we essentially
"rename" the disconnected dentry and connect it to the tree and return
that.  There can never be both connected and disconnected dentry aliases
on an inode at one time.
This is handled inside the ext3 lookup code, I'm not sure how easy/hard
it would be to make a generic VFS patch to do the same.
Cheers, Andreas
