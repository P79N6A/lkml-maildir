Hmm, sounds like this would also need a "MAP_NOREUSE" flag of some  
kind for security sensitive applications.  Basically, I wouldn't want  
my ssh-agent pages holding private SSH keys to be reused by my web  
browser which then gets exploited :-D.  It would also be a massive  
information leak under SELinux.  To fix it properly according to the  
SELinux model you would need to tag each page with a label  
immediately after it's freed and then do an access-vector-check  
against the old page and the new process before allowing reuse.  On  
the other hand, that would probably be at least as expensive as  
zeroing the page.
