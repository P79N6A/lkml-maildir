No. Not complete crap. It's a thirty two bit integer. What do you expect
when you hit the "limit"?
What will ext2 report when you have 4G inodes in use?
Just capping is the best way. 
And as Reiserfs has the option of still storing (at least)
LARGE_NUMBER more files it can simply report that as well. 
Anyway, I happen to (also) work for a company called
"harddisk-recovery.nl". We get to see varying types of uses for
harddisk and their contents. So far we've had two clients with more
than half a million files. One had 3.6 and the other had 4.7 million
files. Trust me, those are extreme. Oh, and we have on the order of 10
million files ourselves (but notquite that many inodes!). We're
extreme.
The tendency is that when disks get larger, so do the files. The
number of files grows much slower than the number of bytes. 
So a factor of 1000 will last us some 40 years instead of the 20 that
Mr Moore predicts. Now Alan is saying that by the time we have
512Mbyte of RAM on video cards we'll all be using 64 bit anyway. Well
I predict that he's a bit optimistic in that respect. But in 40 years,
you'll have your new 64 bit statfs. You can be certain of that.

1) I can still work on files smaller than 2G without problems. 
2) If my shell uses O_LARGEFILE, I can redirect stdin and stdout
to large files anyway, even if the app would open without O_LARGEFILE.
