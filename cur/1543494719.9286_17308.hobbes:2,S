I don't know what the kernel does when the filesystem is full. But you
can avoid that by automating the truncating of the accounting file.
If you don't want to just truncate the file but keep a summary of the
data, try my acctsum package (
http://hjb-net.de/download/acctsum_e.html
).
I use it since nearly three years and all the summary data use only
3 MB of disk space (and they aren't even compressed).
Oh, that's one thing I could add: compression of the data. Thanks for
the inspiration ;-)
My package works for kernel 2.2 too, although 2.0 and 2.2 are not
compatible.
