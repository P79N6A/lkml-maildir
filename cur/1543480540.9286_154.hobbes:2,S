Using kernel 2.2.0-pre7-ac4 (and also 2.1.131), I get the following
message when trying to play some sound:
Jan 18 22:34:54 dslab7 kernel: Sound error: Couldn't allocate DMA
buffer
This seems to happen after I've been doing a lot of floppy-work (i.e
cat'ing kernel-images to /dev/fd0). The following is a piece of my
dmesg:
VFS: Disk change detected on device fd(2,0)
VFS: Disk change detected on device fd(2,0)
DMA memory shortage. Temporarily falling back on virtual DMA
VFS: Disk change detected on device fd(2,0)
VFS: Disk change detected on device fd(2,0)
So what might be happening is that the floppy driver leaks DMA memory
buffers. Or not. But this behavior is quite repeatable, so something
somewhere is wrong.
