I'd be very happy to see MMC support getting into the vanilla kernel. 
I'm about to purchase a HP NX7010 which has a currently unsupported 
MMC/SD card reader. It is my intention to attempt to write a driver for 
this reader (a Winbond w83l518d) and it'll make it easier with the MMC 
routines already in the kernel.
Memory cards are beginning to replace floppys so the sooner linux has 
good support for them the better =)
Are there any reason SD[IO] is left out? From what I can gather the 
unencrypted parts of SD are in the open now. Am I missing something here?
