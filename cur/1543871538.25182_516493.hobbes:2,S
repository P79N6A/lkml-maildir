I assume that the *only* reason for having multiple dentries is really 
just the output in /proc/<pid>/fd/, right? Or is there any other reason to 
have separate dentries for these pseudo-files?
It's a bit sad to waste that much memory (and time) on something like 
that. I bet that the dentry setup is a noticeable part of the whole 
sigfd()/timerfd() setup. It's likely also a big part of any memory 
footprint if you have lots of them.
So how about just doing:
 - do a single dentry
 - make a "struct file_operations" member function that prints out the 
   name of the thing in /proc/<pid>/fd/, and which *defaults* to just 
   doing the d_path() on the dentry, but special filesystems like this 
   could do something else (like print out a fake inode number from the 
   "file->f_private_data" information)
There seems to really be no downsides to that approach. No existing 
filesystem will even notice (they'll all have NULL in the new f_op 
member), and it would allow pipes etc to be sped up and use less memory.
