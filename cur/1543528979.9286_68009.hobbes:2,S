The was an even more recent change in the kernel that changed all the
operations structures to use labelled initialisers.  The new recommended
syntax is this:
static struct file_operations th_fops = {
       write:	th_write,
};
Trailing commas are used extensively in the kernel, to avoid typos when
cutting and pasting or when using #ifdef.  E.g. take a look at mem.c and
lp.c.
have a nice day,
