Perhaps, but this also violates the principle that the kernel
should just *work* with sensible defaults.  I don't use an initrd,
or an initramfs, and have no intention of ever doing so.
I *like* having a single boot image with no unneeded/unwanted complexity.
It's only recently that I've even come round to using some loadable
modules for things like network drivers -- I prefer a single image
for as much as possible (like Linus there).
If putting a C-library and utilities "into the kernel" still leaves
me with a single image file, then.. maybe.  Seems clumsy, though.
Handling interrupts efficiently is a very basic, core function
for any operating system kernel.  With CONFIG_IRQBALANCE=y, Linux is
fine at present.  But that's not available in 64-bit mode,
so we have a deficiency there.
I guess I'll patch it into my kernels soon-ish.
Cheers
