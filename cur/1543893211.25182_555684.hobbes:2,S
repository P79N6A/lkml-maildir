Oh really?
UTF-8 works even for Japanese.  Thank you and Jan for the suggestion.

Yes, that's the point.
At least for Japanese, there is a great activity "JF" as Tsugikazu 
Shibata mentioned.  It is a separate project from the tree, and it often 
happens that some documentations are outdated.  If we could merge them, 
they could be kept up-to-date IMHO.
But, on the other hand, it is fact that kernel tar ball would bloat.
Your opinion above as "creating official space in kernel.org and putting 
pointer in Documentation" seems good for me.
Hmm...
