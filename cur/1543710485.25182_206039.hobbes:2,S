IIUC, the current VM loses the aging information as soon as a page is 
swapped out.  You might be asking for a LFU list instead of a LRU list.
Though, a reverse LFU (MFU -- most frequently used?) used only for swap 
might do what you want also...

There was talk in Andrea's objrmap thread about using two LRU lists, but 
I forget what the benefits of that were.

In short, that probably would require some major surgery in the VM.
