Subject: [PATCH?] mount flag to turn off nfs-client lockd (2.3.49-2)

I've been running 2.3.x on one of my workstations for a little while now
(as part of my "well, magicfilter 2 is almost ready to go, so I might as
well start testing my kernel patches" February scheme) and, aside from
the usual crop of things that I had to convert to get 2.3 to actually
work on Mastodon, I found that the nfs client was spitting out a
fantastically large number of bitter complaints about lockd not running
on my (linux 2.0.28+logo + userland nfsd) local file server.  Tonight, I
finally got fed up and hacked in a little patch to add the mount options
"lock" (try to run lockd) and "nolock" (what you'd expect) to
fs/nfs/nfsroot.c
They shut the kernel up, which is good.  Are they correct?
