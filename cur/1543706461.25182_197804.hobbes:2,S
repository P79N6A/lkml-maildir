To followup on this: I've recently moved my entire installation to ext3 (I had 
to RMA the disk, tarred everything up, formatted another disk, put everything 
back but on ext3 this time), on which the laptopmode actually makes a 
difference. I can hear the disk spindown, and it stays that way for a 
reasonably long time (e.g. +- 10 minutes has happened).
So there does seem to be a serious difference between the reiserfs commit 
option and the ext3 option.
Just letting you folks know.
