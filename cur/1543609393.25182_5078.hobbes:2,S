That was reassuring enough that I persisted and found that the problem
was this: my home-spun SYN-flooder wasn't changing the TCP sequence
number, and so the "victim" was discarding the packets.  
The three-second pause I observed previously was a red herring that
went away when I started using separate hosts for flooding and
connection-testing. 
Now I see a night-and-day difference between with and without SYN
cookies (although when tcp_max_syn_backlog is set to more than a five
it takes a long time to fill the queue).
Thanks again.
