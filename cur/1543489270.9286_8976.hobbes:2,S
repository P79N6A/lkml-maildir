Ok, I guess I am the maintainer. And, yes, I am aware of a few reports
of machines on which the detection does not work. The problem is that
there seem to be a lot of different implementations of the PS/2 mouse
port out there. The old detection code seemed to work ok, but was
removed because the mouse had to be plugged in at boot in order to be
detected. Then, for a few kernel versions, we didn't have any detection
at all, but always assumed the port was present. This had the slight
disadvantage of locking up the keyboard if a nonexistent mouse port was
accessed.
Suggestions? Personally, I'd like to see the old BIOS based code back.
