This is the vmlinux.lds.S problem. The cleanup patch from Sam Ravnborg
moved the __initramfs_start and __initramfs_end symbols into
the .init.ramfs section. This is in itself not a problem, but it
surfaced a bug: there is no *(.init.initramfs), that needs to be
*(init.ramfs). I corrected this in the upstream patch but 2.6.23-mm1 has
the older one that still causes the "Cannot open root device". For
2.6.23-mm1 use the patch below.
