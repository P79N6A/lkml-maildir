In my version they'd run unchanged as well.
And  BTW,  I wasn't  talking  about introducing  a  new  open at  libc
level.  I was  talking about  modifying the  open system  call  in the
kernel and having libc provide compatibility for the old call.
Since  I'm not  sure  how much  breakage it  takes  to make  a file  a
directory.
