Huh. Somehow there was this entry in /etc/iftab:
eth0 mac 00:0d:61:44:90:12 arp 1
But that's not my mac address. Damned if I know how that got there, but
if the persistent rules only work on later kernels, that'd explain it.
And indeed ... removing that entry makes it work more normally.
Thanks for the pointers - most helpful.
