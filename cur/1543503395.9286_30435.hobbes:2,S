Greetings!  We had a complete ethernet lockup last weekend.  We did an
ifconfig eth0 down, ifconfig eth0 up ... , which restored the network,
but with enormous delays in all traffic, e.g. ping.  Only ifconfig
eth0 down; modprobe -r 3c59x; /etc/init.d/network (reloading the
module) restored normal functionality.  The system itself did not
hang. 
Machine: i486, 48M RAM, PCI, Vortex 3c590 PCI card, Sangoma wanpipe
	 card, mitsumi cdrom, 2 modems, printer.
Kernel: 2.2.7-ac1, gcc 2.7.2.3
