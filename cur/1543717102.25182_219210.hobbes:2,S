I believe the relevant point is that it is no longer a 'patch' but merged in 
mainline 2.6. in fact, it was merged early-mid 2.5 (don't know the precise 
version, didn't pay that much attn).

Unfortunately for those of us who still like the 2.4 kernel, the Preempt patch  
for 2.4 (previously maintained by Robert Love) is, to my knowledge, no longer 
maintained except by some distros. The official stance is that everybody 
should go with 2.6. And as the preempt patch is not something that can be 
trivially ported/maintained (requiring intimate knowledge of internals), it 
shall likely remain so.
