Yes .. I know about this but it can allow plug some subset of current 
coding style problems. Prodicing Perfect-Word in sigle step is probably 
impossible but start this step by step will be probably rationale :)
Look below is it not will be good now start:
1) review current tree for fix/change code allow pass throw indent without
    errors and commit all neccessary for this changes,
2) produce diff for whole source tree and start disscuss on "are
    current Lindent script indentation rules are correct or not ?",
3) after prepare acceptable by Linus indent rules set setup kind of
    moratory for all (co)developers for submitting indentation changes
    during normal changes submission (month or even half year but IMo
    shorter will be better),
4) aftter passing moratory date Linus can commit all pending changes in
    single commit.
