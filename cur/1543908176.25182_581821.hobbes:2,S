There are currently two RDMA solutions available.  Each solution has 
different requirements and uses the normal network stack differently. 
Infiniband uses its own transport.  iWarp runs over TCP.
We have tried to leverage the existing infrastructure where it makes sense.

Currently, the RDMA stack uses its own port space.  This causes a 
problem for iWarp, and is what Steve is looking for a solution for.  I'm 
not an iWarp guru, so I don't know what options exist.  Can iWarp use 
its own address family?  Identify specific IP addresses for iWarp use? 
Restrict iWarp to specific port numbers?  Let the app control the 
correct operation?  I don't know.
Steve merely defined a problem and suggested a possible solution.  He's 
looking for constructive help trying to solve the problem.
