A popular way which also resolves atomicity issues is to just have a 
'control' file, to which you write(2) a command code and 
command-specific data, and read(2) results of the operation (if any). 
This would allow you to do a new-table command, a suspend command, a 
resume-with-existing-table command, a resume-with-new-table command, 
etc.  In other words, a more flexible ioctl(2) ;-)
Preferred method of data input is always ASCII, but if that is 
unreasonable, make sure your binary data is fixed-endian and fixed-size 
on all architectures.
