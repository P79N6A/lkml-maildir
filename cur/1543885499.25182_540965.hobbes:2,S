I don't worry about non-2's-complement machines (they don't exist, and 
likely won't exist in the future either).
So I worry about compilers rewriting my code.
So "(long)(a-b) < 0" (with "a" and "b" being unsigned long) is basically a 
portable way of testing the high bit of the result.

That certainly works too, but the difference is irrelevant, since Linux is 
unlikely to work on insane machines anyway (ie we do make a lot of other 
assumptions about the architecture, being two's-complement is the least of 
those).
So you basically shouldn't worry about hardware: everybody is pretty much 
the same. You should worry about *compilers* - that's where the 
differences show up.
So "(long)(a-b)" may be "implementation defined" (but since 
implementations are all 2's complement, we don't care), but a signed 
"(a-b)" that over/overflows is *undefined*, and that is much worse because 
it means that the compiler can do some funky stuff, and _that_ is a real 
practical worry.
And no, I also don't worry about porting Linux to 18-bit machines, or to 
ternary CPU's.
