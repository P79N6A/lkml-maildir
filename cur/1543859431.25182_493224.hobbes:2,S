It's about ergonomics, not technical capabilities or fairness.

Then that means you can't have usable autodetection and power savings
at the same time.  That's a pefectly acceptable answer, you just have
to give the choice between the two to the user.  From the kernel
p.o.v, it just means that you probably need 3 modes:
1- active and exchanging packets
2- inactive but waiting for plugging and able to tell something is
   going on fast (like 0.5s fast)
3- powered off
and they probably already exist (UP+addr/procmisc. set, UP and DOWN).
And if the second mode can't be lower power than the first, that's
just life.  An hypothetical mode 4 identical to 2 without the "fast"
part is just not worth bothering with.
  OG.
