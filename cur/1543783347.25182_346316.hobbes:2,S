Where are the benchmarks and stability analysis?  How many hours does it 
survive cerberos running on all nodes simultaneously?  Where are the 
testimonials from users?  How long has there been a gfs2 filesystem?  Note 
that Reiser4 is still not in mainline a year after it was first offered, why 
do you think gfs2 should be in mainline after one month?
So far, all catches are surface things like bogus spinlocks.  Substantive 
issues have not even begun to be addressed.  Patience please, this is going 
to take a while.
Regards,
Daniel
