Statically allocating platform devices works, I can register those just
fine and I don't see any oops when loading/removing the module. Even
though there are no signs of breakage, should I change my code anyway?
I'm trying to keep the code as simple as possible. The platform device,
platform driver and the input device will live only as long as the
module is loaded. There is nothing else that would rely or depend on my
driver. Any advices you can give? Or is there nothing that I could use
to keep the code simple?
