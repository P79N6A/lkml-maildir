Realistically, I don't think the delay will amount to anything more than
using the lock instruction: as soon as the write propagates through the
store buffers (which would have to be emptied for a locked cycle anyways),
the requests of other cpus to read that location will result in their copy
being updated at the earliest possible time.  Of course, a benchmark could
proven me wrong =)
