well, maybe the SGI folks can give us some numbers?

you are a bit biased towards low-latency NUMA setups i guess (read: 
Opterons) :-) Obviously with a low NUMA factor, we dont have to deal 
with memory access assymetries all that much.
But i think we should expand our file caching architecture into those 
caching details nevertheless: it's directly applicable to software 
driven clusters as well. There pagecache replication on nodes is a must, 
and obviously there it makes a big difference whether files are cached 
locally or remotely.
