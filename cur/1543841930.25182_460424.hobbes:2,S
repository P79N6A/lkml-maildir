No, in several cases it was a problem with a broken/damaged sensor cable.
But it seems there are a number of different problems with thermal
management, a non-working sensor cable only being (albeit a significant)
one of those.
Google "MacBook random shutdown" will provide tons of information.

Let's hope people get that braindamage resolved, either via BIOS updates
(hmm, but probably not helpful in case of ACPI?) or by shipping/repairing
into working hardware (an astonishing amount of people already had their
2nd or 3rd non-working repair).
