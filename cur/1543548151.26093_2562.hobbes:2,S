You are right for some reason my last 5 upgrades have copied the correct System.map(with version numer in the name) into /boot but not updated the link. I have to investigate why this happens. I guess most tools use the right
version anyway otherwise I would have seen this error before.
Is there some way I can fix the old report I don't have a unprocessed version of the oops as klogd "fixed" it automatically.
Sorry for the bogus report.
