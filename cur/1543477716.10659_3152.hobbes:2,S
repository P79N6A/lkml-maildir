There's no point developing our own partitioning scheme; if we want a
better partitioning scheme, we should just use the BSD disklabel format.
The real problem with any alternative scheme, though, is that it becomes
incompatible with Dos/Windows/NT systems, and many Linux users need to
be able to coexist with them.  The BSD systems have developed some
schemes where two partition tables (one for their own and one for
DOS/Windows/etc.) coexist, but there's lots of potential for lossage if
the two partition tables get out of sync.  (For exampe, if a fdisk
program under Linux or Windos which doesn't know about the BSD label
modifies the partition table; now the BSD label is out of sync.)
