I am sorry if this is old news but I have not seen any mention of it in the
list.
I keep getting "kernel: Sound error: Couldn't allocate DMA buffer" in my
syslog. However sound was working until this morning. The machine uptime is
below :)
The PC is a IBM PS/2 486DX2, with an AWE32 with 256k. The PC is fitted with
16mb of ram. I have never reported a problem before so excuse if it is a bit
strange.
Sean
