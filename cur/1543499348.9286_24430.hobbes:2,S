Alan,
I agree that this is a nice feature of IRIX, but in my benchmark I make no
use of disk access in the process itself,
The process  does only sit in a loop and write() data from RAM to /dev/dsp
( RT FIFO scheduled),
and in background I call scripts which write / copy / read from/to large files,
trying to disturb the RT thread.
Obviously my disk I/O processes are scheduled without realtime priority.
The scheduling latencies on Linux go up to 70-130ms on pretty high end HW.
The thing which I wanted to say, was that runnning these benchmarks on IRIX,
(playing audio from RAM using a small audiobuffer ( <20ms)  and doing 
while other processes perform heavy disk I/O, would not cause such
long lasting process stalls.
regards,
Benno
