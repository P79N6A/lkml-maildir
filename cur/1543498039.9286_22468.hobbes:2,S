Hi,
We're running clean 2.2.9UP (with the deleted line in ip-options.c), and
the server crashed with many oops first at EIP 0010:[<3ea160f4>] (process
netscape) :
Call Trace: [inet_sendmsg+0/164] [tcp_v4_sendmsg+92/104] [inet_sendmsg+143/164] [inet_sendmsg+0/164] [sock_sendmsg+138/176] [inet_sendmsg+0/164] [sock_write+153/164]
            [sock_write+0/164] [sys_write+196/236] [system_call+52/56]
Then during the show_registers function ;-(
There were many oops at these addresses and one at sys_lseek.
The logs are too huge so I put them onto web :
                   
http://oxygene.terra.vein.hu/~lgb/report/
All the information we have :
* kernel log with oops messages
* System.map
* the vmlinux file
I hope it will be enough and the report will be usefull.
Thx : Gabor,
