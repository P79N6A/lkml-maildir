Maybe you shouldn't trust that, then :-)
Seriously, I suppose it depends on the drive or maybe that IBM
interprets the bits differently. This puppy:
IC35L040AVVA07-0
says it doesn't support it either, but I can damn well assure you that
it does. What it doesn't support (like other IBM's) is trying to change
it, then it complains.
So I'd be willing to bet lots of money that you drive generates service
interrupts just fine. As I said, I've yet to see one that doesn't.
