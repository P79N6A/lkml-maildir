How about this patch?  This doesn't leak memory hopefully.

Patch to cleanup reads to f_count from ppp driver, deprecate PPPIOCDETACH 
ioctl, and print warning messages if the ioctl is used.  
A new 'detached' field is included in struct ppp_file, and the ppp
channel/interface is marked as detached when PPPIOCDETACH is invoked
instead of checking the f_count and failing the ioctl for 'if the fd was
dup'd' case. The ppp structure is freed on last close.
 
Patch tested with ppp-2.4.0 and ppp-2.4.2.  I could actually dial out :)
