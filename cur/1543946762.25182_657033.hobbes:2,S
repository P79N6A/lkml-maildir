They're for saving and restoring GPU state across suspend/resume.  They're 
particularly useful if your machine doesn't re-POST at resume time.  In that 
case your GPU may be totally uninitialized, so either the kernel or X has to 
set it up for you (X only does that partially).

Interesting, which chipset do you have?  AFAIK that shouldn't cause a hang.

I know I fixed that problem in at least one configuration...  Can you try:
  # echo test > /sys/power/disk
  # echo disk > /sys/power/state
and see if that also turns your screen green?
Also, getting a GPU register dump would be helpful.  The intel_reg_dumper tool 
is built as part of the xf86-video-driver build 
(git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/xorg/driver/xf86-video-intel), can you 
pull that down and try it out?
Thanks,
