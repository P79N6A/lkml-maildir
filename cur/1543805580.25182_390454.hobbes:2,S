IIRC, Martine Silberman did some of the developement for
ia64 support. At least she provided the original documentation
for 2.6.4 kernel. So this is mostly not new code.

I've also posted 2.6.10 tg3 patch to enable MSI:

I've been using MSI-X on ia64 with OpenIB for over a year.
My guess is that was also starting with 2.6.10.
Here's current output with 2.6.15:

Could you post the debug output you've collected so far?

It should look similar for ia64 since both use 0xfeeXXXXX
Processor Interrupt Block address and similar intr vectors.

APIC_DEAFULT_BASE isn't used.  See 
fgrep MSI_ADDRESS_HEADER drivers/pci/*
drivers/pci/msi.c:      dest_id = (MSI_ADDRESS_HEADER << MSI_ADDRESS_HEADER_SHIFT);
drivers/pci/msi.h:#define MSI_ADDRESS_HEADER            0xfee
drivers/pci/msi.h:#define MSI_ADDRESS_HEADER_SHIFT      12
drivers/pci/msi.h:#define MSI_ADDRESS_HEADER_MASK       0xfff000
This is one of the things that Mark Maule/SGI needs to change
to support MSI on SN2.
