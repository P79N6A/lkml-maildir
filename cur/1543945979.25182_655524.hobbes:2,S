Some more numbers, with exact scenario
1. Mount the cgroup
2. Make 3 groups
3. Start kernbench in each group
4. Start chew.
This is the chew output from the root cgroup 
[root@llm11 dhaval]# ./chew2 
pid 29345 preempted 544115 us after 1560 us
pid 29345 preempted 588109 us after 3935 us
pid 29345 preempted 632122 us after 3941 us
pid 29345 preempted 794259 us after 3954 us
pid 29345 preempted 972163 us after 3963 us
pid 29345 preempted 1024219 us after 3942 us
From within one of the groups
[root@llm11 dhaval]# ./chew2 
pid 27961 preempted 4028 us after 1708 us
pid 27961 preempted 28090 us after 5466 us
pid 27961 preempted 52021 us after 6505 us
pid 27961 preempted 56100 us after 7183 us
