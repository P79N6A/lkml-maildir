Greetings,
Andrew asked me to test the 2.6.16-rc1 in regards to an Oops I got at
bootup in 2.6.15 a few weeks ago.
The error was due to a null pointer dereferencing in the USB HID code
(drivers/usb/input/pid.c line 262):
OLD (error) code:
struct hid_input *hidinput = list_entry(&hid->inputs, struct hid_input, list);
NEW (fixed) code:
struct hid_input *hidinput = list_entry(hid->inputs.next, struct
hid_input, list);
The code fix is indeed in 2.6.16-rc1 and the Oops on bootup doesn't
happen on my system anymore with 2.6.16-rc1.
The original debug and Oops messages are still available online in
case anyone doesn't have anything more interesting to read... ;-)
