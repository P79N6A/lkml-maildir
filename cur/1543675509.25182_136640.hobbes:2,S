Subject: [2.5.70] Config options for PS/2 console

Which config options are *required* for PS/2 keyboard support?
With 2.5.70 (or 2.5.69) I cannot use remote console redirection of a
Siemens Primergy H450 system.  Some keys are dead, others result in
error messages such as:
atkbd.c: Unknown key (set 0, scancode 0xed, on isa0060/serio0) pressed.         
2.4.x worked fine (but I didn't enable special input support or things
like that).
