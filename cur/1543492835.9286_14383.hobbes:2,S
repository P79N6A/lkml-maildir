Mindcraft, not Netcraft! Netcraft is a very accurate monthly survey of web
server usage, please do not confuse them with Mindcraft.
Incidentally Netcraft's April report was released yesterday, it shows that
NT based server usage is starting to drop drastically after months of
stagnation. [NT platform relative usage is down to 24.97%, thats a -0.66%
drop from a month ago, pretty large considering the millions of hosts
involved. Apache platform up +1.19% to 59.87%.] See:

Microsoft is certainly feeling the heat from Apache, and they cannot give
IIS any cheaper. (well, not counting negative price) I guess this is the
first time in computer history that Microsoft is losing a dumping war, and
this is a new experience for them. So no real surprise that they are
beginning to panic and publish a clearly rigged comparison of NT vs.
Linux. (especially considering that the Halloween II. document admitted
that their own NT Performance Group found Linux _2.0_ to be on equal
footing regarding Samba performance :)
so stay calm and work on those fixes :) the goal is to have Linux
outperform NT even under the most unfair settings and configuration.
