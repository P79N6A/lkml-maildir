Ok, I'll consider move the old interface part to a separate file as Arjan suggested.

Not sure if I understand. Using attribute_gropu?

If it really does matter, I'll. Other drivers have the same issue, and
nobody complains. I suppose it's really module instead of build-in. In
the meantime it's meanless to let the module build-in, as the firmware
usually isn't in initramfs.

We need update it when suspend/resume and hotplug. Userspace can
manually update it as well.
