Wrong. Ingo patch was cooked up with help of benchmark and DOES NOT have any
strong design under it. Unfortunatelly THE ONLY thing that can be proved with
benchmark is UNAVAILABILITY of hard real-time, not AVAILIABILITY of anything.

Not at all. It's matter of guarantee. RTLinux CAN guarantee real-time (modulo
bugs) - it was designed for it. Ingo patch CAN NOT. It fixes places which is
known (more or less known, raither less then more; but it's other sory) to be
bad for latency. It does not guarantee yu anything - it's pretty possible that
some other software/hardware configuration will trigger situation where (even
with Ingo patches!) Linux will not respond for second or so. It's does not even
gurantee that on some weird (for you but not for user) configuration we'll not
get such drop-outs for every minute or so. It's just quick hack "to make it
wotk here and now" - nothing more.

Yeah. And Ingo patch DOES NOT guarantee you peak sheduling latency. Neither 5ms
nor even 1s. Want to see sluggish system with Ingo patch applied ? I can cook
up kernel module to make such a system in minutes. Now take look on number of
available drivers. Do you really assume there are NO drivers/filesystem/modules
who will make system sluggish with Ingo's patch ? You are joking, right ?
And if you can con induce user to not use ANY such "bad" module (or perhaps
even program - I'm quite sure some stupid program can trigger high latency
as well even with Ingo patch) then why the hell you can induce the usage user
to use your own "patched for this great application" kernel ? Gosh...

Oh yeah. Just there are difference betweek more-then-5ms-latency-once-per-week
and 1sec-latency-once-per-minute . Ingo patch claims to give you first thing
while in fact in quite likely situation it'll give you second. RTLinux does
not suffer from such problem.
DO> That's not really interesting to this discussion though,
It IS interesting. The more discussion progresses the less likely standard
linux looks like good platform for your application. First you need 5ms latency
in application without disk I/O, then you need 5ms latency for network
application, now some developer request 101% reliability. It looks more and
more like request for RTOS to me. And Linux is NOT RTOS. For better or for
worse it's not RTOS and not trying to be RTOS. Larry's initial decision of
request ("Other operating systems offer "soft realtime" and we don't want to
port our code from that to the RT Linux model" and translation: "other
operating systems have made poor design decisions, let's try and pressure
Linus into doing the same thing with Linux") looks more and more justified.

Yeah ? With how much systems and how much @##$$% drivers, third-party modules
(like softmodem ones) and how much weird programs (like VMWare) ? I repeat:
if you can control other parts of user environment then why you can not control
his choice of kernel ?

Let me not believe in it. I'll put this 8 years old IDE without DMA support
and weird timing requirements (so you can not even use unmask irq hack) in my
700MHz Athlon system and your 5ms goal is way out of reach. And if you can
control THIS aspect of system then why you can not control user's kernel
choice ?

If it's true that it's the end of story - Linux will not suit you, go use
RTLinux or some other OS.

It just adds god knows how much petential deadlocks - not a big deal, really.
"Lets add potentially dangerous code so millions will suffer and thusands will
benefit". Does not look like good deal to me.

Benchmarketing, yeah ? Not @ lkml, please.

If it's so great for YOU then use it. If you push EVERYONE to use it... It's
other story (see above).

WHAT kind of patches ? Few (really few) small, justified changes can slip
in 2.4 at any stage. Deep rework of linux internals (if there are no way to
fix problem with few simple kludges - and by few I mean few: 3,5 may be 8,
but NOT 20 or 50) is 2.5 stuff anyway. Just remember that you can just one
try: if Linus will accept few such kludges and then week later you'll come
and say "oh, it was not enough, let's add some more" then most probably you'll
get nothing and Linus can even pull out old kludges - such scenario is not
impossible (= it happended). Of course Linus can accept some of proprosed
changes and then if it's not enough can accept some more from initially
proposed set - it's other story.
