That will already happen today.  /sbin/hotplug will be called whenever a
new PCI card is added or removed, IF you have a PCI Hotplug controller
driver that works for your cPCI board.

Yes, you are correct.  But odds are there is not a PCI Hotplug
controller for your hardware, so this probably will not work.  However,
your driver should work just fine to control your card.
What kind of cPCI controller do you have?
