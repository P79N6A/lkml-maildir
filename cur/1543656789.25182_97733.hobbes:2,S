Just because a bug is 'owned' does not stop someone else working on it.
That would be silly. All the owner field says is, "if someone is
interested in this bug, and they happen to fix before $owner does,
$owner would like to know about it." This way $owner can reject bad
fixes, or get further clues as to whats actually causing the problem.
