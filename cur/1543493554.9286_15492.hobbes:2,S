wrong.  only Trio64V+ and newer chips support newmmio mode 
and need 64M footprint/alignment (and only for newmmio mode!).
this is a plain old Trio64 chip, so base address is fine here.

wrong. PCI config regs are not about _installed_ memory but about 
address space requirements (footprint) of the card.
if you'd like to know how much memory is installed on your card,
check the S3 chip's config register CR36.

which Trio64 version and chip revision are you talking about?
I don't know any plain Trio64 which occupies 64M, and no
more recent version which doesn't correctly claim the needed 64M.
AFAIK only S3 868 and 968 have a similar bug: they require 64M
but only claim 32M causing bad layout/alignment if the main BIOS
doesn't know/fix this bug.

again: not needed for Trio64 rev. 10.
