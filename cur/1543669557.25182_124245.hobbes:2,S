Its a thing from the old 8bit gaming world.  You code in 5bit chunks
with a leading length marker. 5bits is enough for a-z and some bits
of punctuation, plus capital implying space and 'escape' for an 8bit
sequence block.
Gets you a bit under 40% compression with real life data and takes about
200 bytes to decode
