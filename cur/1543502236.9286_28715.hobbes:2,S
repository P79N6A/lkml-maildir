Appart from the fact that the quota format is endian and wordsize dependent,
so you cannot take a disk with quotas, move it from Sparc to Intel and
expect things to work.
If it had at least some magic which would contain at least the endianess and
wordsize, quotaon could convert the file format from any format to any other
one, but now it has no way to guess it.
