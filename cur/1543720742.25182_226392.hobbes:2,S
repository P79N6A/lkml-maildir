That is how it looks from fs side, from disk side it may look like this:
write some data sectors (rest stays in cache)
write rest of data sectors (from cache)
write some commit sectors (rest stays in cache)
write rest of commit sectors (from cache)
fs atomic operations != disk atomic operations

Yes.
The quoted part of my mail is about situation when poweroff happens between
'write some commit sectors' and 'write rest of commit sectors (from cache)'
or during transferring commit sectors to a disk.
In both situations we end up with corrupted journal.

Sure.  What's your opinion about doing blk_issue_flush() and ordinary commit
(pros+cons given in my previous mail)?

Yes but things get more complicated with write caching on a disk side,
i.e. it is too late to report to application when you discover I/O error.
