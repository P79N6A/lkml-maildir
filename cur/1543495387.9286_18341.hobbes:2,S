   I tried `modprobe rd rd_size=8192' and got:
   /lib/modules/2.2.6/block/rd.o: invalid parameter rd_size
   You ment changing the value of rd_size in drivers/block/rd.c, did you not?
   How difficult would it be making it a module parameter? Does not
   kernel/setup.c, kernel/head.S use this value?
That's funny.  There's a MODULE_PARAM(rd_sizd, "1i") declaration the
drivers/block/rd.c which should have allowed this to work, which is the
answer to your question about how to make things a module parameter.  
I have the ramdisk compiled into my kernel at the moment, so I can't
test this, but it should work....
