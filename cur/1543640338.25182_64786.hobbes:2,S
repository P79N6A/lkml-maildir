I think that sounds good.
I have a patch which I can send - it needs to be rediffed I suspect -
that has each network device feed the entropy pool. (Actually, it
creates a new flag, SA_NET_RANDOM, that defines to SA_SAMPLE_RANDOM or 0
depending on a configure setting.  If you want it unconditional, that is
just as easy though).
