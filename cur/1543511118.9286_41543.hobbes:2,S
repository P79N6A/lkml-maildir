After I read your mail, I read spinlocks.txt and some of the ide code.  Bear
in mind that I probably have very little idea of what I'm doing, but I was
trying to learn.
Anyway, I did this, which seemed to fix the problem:

This patch applies cleanly against 2.2.12.  I believe it should apply
cleanly to any newish 2.2 or 2.3 kernel.
I did some minor stress testing on this kernel, and it doesn't crash after
20-30 minutes of constant concurrent channel acces, and it used to crash
within a second.
Like I said, I don't know the faintest thing about kernel development, so if
this is conceptually wrong somewhere, it's not surprising.  However, I think
it at least narrows down the field a bit.
Thanks,
Tom
