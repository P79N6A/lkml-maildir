Does anyone know the status on these patches?  I see that they've been
taken out of the latest 2.2.x redhat kernels.  Are they completely
unusable currently, or is it e.g. a problem where some % of the
motherboards or chipsets out there don't like them and need workarounds?
I'd like to put them on some dual proc PIII/500 ASUS P2B-DSes and Tyan
Thunderbolts.  Anyone know if they're suitable or not?
