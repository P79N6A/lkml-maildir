If we are going to extend the concept of machines for i386 we should
add a default CONFIG option for the generic case.
Then we could do something like:
core-$(CONFIG_MACH_I386GENERIC)  += arch/i386/mach-generic
core-$(CONFIG_MACH_VISWS)        += arch/i386/mach-visws
core-$(CONFIG_MACH_SUMMIT)       += arch/i386/mach-generic
mflags-$(CONFIG_MACH_VISWS)      := asm/mach-visws
mflags-$(CONFIG_MACH_SUMMIT)     := asm/mach-summit
mflags-y                         += asm/mach-generic
AFLAGS += $(mflags-y)
CFLAGS += $(mflags-y)
There is something similar done for arm in newest kernel.
