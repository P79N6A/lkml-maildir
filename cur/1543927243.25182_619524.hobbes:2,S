this is not the first time (and not the last time) that a missing 
PF_NOFREEZE is causing hard to debug suspend problems. I think we should 
be more robust about this and at minimum include some debug mechanism 
that determines when a PF_NOFREEZE annotation is missing. (or at least 
detect the condition somehow and report it) This bug took 10 days to 
track down.
