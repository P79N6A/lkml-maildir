If that's the cause, the fix is to back out whatever was done to break
userspace. Breaking userspace is not ok. Upgrading from 2.6.x to
2.6.x+1 should not entail replacing substantial parts of userspace,
especially with NOT-EVEN-FRAKKING-RELEASED-YET CODE. 
I will try a new HAL when it shows up in Debian/unstable and not a
moment sooner.

Will double-check the iwconfig tests. It's been masked by
NetworkManager for a while.
