It makes it harder to page out pages from the task holding the
token.  I wonder if kswapd should try to steal the token away
from the task holding it, so in effect nobody holds the token
when the system isn't under a heavy swapping load.

partly one of time, he would explain. Where as the tourist generally hurries
back home at the end of a few weeks or months, the traveler belonging no more
to one place than to the next, moves slowly, over periods of years, from one
part of the earth to another. Indeed, he would have found it difficult to tell,
among the many places he had lived, precisely where it was he had felt most at
home.  -- Paul Bowles
