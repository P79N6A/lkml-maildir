Hi;
With 2.6.20, resuming from disk sometimes cannot returns on vt7 where X runs 
but everything seems working, so just changing to vt1 and returning to vt7 
solves the problem. But dmesg shows some BUG() output like [1] whenever this 
problem occurs
I'm using 20070207 snapshot of suspend, s2disk is used to suspend2disk, 
machine is a Sony Vaio FS-215B which is in the whitelist and works well with 
2.6.16/17/18 (all have fbsplash and vesafb-tng patches [from gentoo] 
applied).
