Well, the kernel compiles are just terrible at everything they could
plausibly be used to measure. I could, in principle, develop a benchmark
that simulates a forking server that does many things similar to what a
kernel compile is meant to measure without a number of its stupidities,
but I've got enough to do already.

NIH == "Not Invented Here." Basically a sort of idea theft, often used
to grab credit for patches. You're not the one involved there. That was
a digression. One could say, though, that a solution to the slab issues
is to NIH slab allocators e.g. via quicklist.h/quicklist.c without the
negative connotation.

Short answer: No.
Long answer: Most of the local patches are not likely to be of interest
to the world at large. The ones I probably don't mind mentioning so
much are things like ports of ipt_TARPIT.c to -CURRENT, support for
mmap() of /proc/profile, things to make the notsc boot parameter
actually do what you'd expect it to do instead of the kernel ignoring
the option when you actually need it and mucking with the TSC behind
your back, and so on. There are also things I'd rather keep under wraps
so they don't mysteriously appear on lkml a few years later posted by
someone else without any attribution to me (i.e. the NIH's that bother
me). I've not got any of them ported to current mainline anyway, and
some data loss from fried disks seems to have eaten most/all of the
post-2.6.0 revisions of these patches anyway, though I've got compiled
kernels with them on various kernel versions between then and 2.6.10
(not to say that's any impediment to my hammering out fresh ports).
