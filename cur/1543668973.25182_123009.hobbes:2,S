For the NMI watchdog to fail (if you have it enabled) requires pretty
major disaster to have occurred since the NMI will be delivered through
any kind of system hang

Memory errors normally generate "Oops" type lines rather than other
stuff

Your choice of components looks fine, its all stuff I trust, even if the
ethernet card is not good for performance it ought to be fine in
