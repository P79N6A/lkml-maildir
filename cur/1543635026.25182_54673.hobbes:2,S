Yeah "bonnie" is a mickey mouse benchmark.

Using the hardware to help us and by working with it it, once can
basically boost the write and slash the cpu usage.

On writes restrict which are small the ordering is almost instant.
Specifically ONE maybe TWO passes will sort.
Reads may need more as we optimize best on big reads.

*BLINK*
It has been generally been ignored so I am glad to see a change, thanks!
I do not do 2.5, remember I go booted and backstabbed.
