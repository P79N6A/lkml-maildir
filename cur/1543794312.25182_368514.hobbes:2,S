Hi all
      I've try to use RS485 on Linux 2.6.8 kernel with PC to RS485
panel keypad. But there is failure and no communication received. I
have used search but no results found for Linux and RS485. Is anyone
got use RS485 and Linux correctly? Does anyone have example
application that can share with me? Thanks in advance.
Sincerely,
Ken
