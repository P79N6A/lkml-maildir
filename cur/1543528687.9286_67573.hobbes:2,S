Of course, take a look at 
ftp://ftp.ucsd.edu/,
 I believe it
is somewhere below 
ftp://ftp.ucsd.edu/hamradio/packet/
You'll also find many other variants of KA9Q NOS there 
(JNOS, Wampes, etc).
What do you want it for, BTW? We have a superb TCP/IP stack
in the kernel, we have kernel AX.25 and applications supporting
it.
