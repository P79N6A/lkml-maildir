I've got driver/firmware that is about 2months old that
certainly helped; prior to that I was getting card
timeouts (although I also upgraded the e1000 driver
at the same time so it might have been that rather
than the 3ware that helped).
(Note: I don't expect a driver to perform a dangerous
operation like firmware flashing on boot!)

Well my ~30MB/s is sucking over gig ether and writing
in 10MB chunks; but still 50MB/s for RAID5 feels like
it sucks.
