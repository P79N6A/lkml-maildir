Dave,
Sorry, false alarm; "make mrproper" fixed that problem.
So here are some results from testing on my SMP box
(dual Celeron abit); all these worked:
  - advansys driver (*)  holds my root fs
  - aha1542 driver (*)  lightly tested
  - imm (*) 100 MB parallel port zip drive
  - scsi reset [part of James's reservation+reset patch]
  - usb-storage to an ATA maxtor 6L040J2 disk via a lava
    external enclosure
  - usb-storage to a sandisk (8MB compact flash card)
  - usb-storage to a casio digital camera
  - scsi_debug driver
Notes:
  - those drivers marked with (*) are broken on SMP 
    machines in 2.5.7-pre2
  - unfortunately my ieee1394 card is another box,
    the sbp2 driver works in 2.5.7-pre2 (although
    it does have some quirks: my lava box claims
    that an ATA disk is SCSI 6 compliant!)
  - as can be seen, several other subsystems depend on
    the scsi subsystem. My guess is the scsi subsystem
    will be seeing more ATA disks (and cd/dvd writers) 
    in external enclosures via usb-2 and 1394 in the 
    future
  - obviously the scsi mid level patches (I'm thinking of
    the report_lun+twin_inquiry) are not causing any
    problems.
  - I noticed the sym53c8xx-2 driver has been updated.
    There is a dc-390u3w on another machine here. If
    there is any problem, I'll contact you
So all in all the scsi subsystem looks pretty good in
"dj1". I did lose some time when my keyboard + mouse
disappeared (.config problems). For those still having
trouble finding their mouse read Documentation/input/input.txt

Fine.
