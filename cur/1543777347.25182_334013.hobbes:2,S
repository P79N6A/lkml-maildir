I did ask for a process listing a while back.  I don't want to
speculate on possible causes until we have some real information
from the system as to what's going on.
Please run up your test program and get the machine into the
problematic state.  Let it remain like that for about 2 minutes,
and then run via a telnet session or other window:
ps aux > /tmp/ps-forrmk.txt
and send me that file.
