Dear all,
Its time that there should be a fix applied to the FAT12 subsystem in
Linux.
I have noted that removable device FAT12 formatted in Camera like
digital media does NOT have the FAT12 in sector 0 instead it has a
partition table that speaks about the FAT12 fs start sector.
Such devices that do NOT have the file system in sector 0 instead have
the partition table are failing to mount under Linux.
Why is it so?
I have even tested USB mounted device suspecting the in-built
card-reader driver I am using?
Even it fails.
Who has to handle this? which layer?
Regards,
Mukund Jampala
