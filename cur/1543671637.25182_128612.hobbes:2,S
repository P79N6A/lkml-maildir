Ok, for clean dma_* implementation on alpha (and others, I guess) we need
to move root level IO controller data from struct pci_dev (pdev->sysdata)
to struct dev. Actually, the latter already has such field (platform_data)
but right now it's kind of parisc specific. ;-)
I'll look into it after short vacation (4-5 days).
Ivan.
