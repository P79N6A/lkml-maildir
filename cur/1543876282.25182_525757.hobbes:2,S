CONFIG_SMP=n:

arch/i386/kernel/microcode.c:628: error: 'suspend_cpu_hotplug' undeclared (first use in this function)
arch/i386/kernel/microcode.c:628: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
arch/i386/kernel/microcode.c:628: error: for each function it appears in.)
arch/i386/kernel/microcode.c: In function 'mc_sysdev_add':

arch/i386/kernel/microcode.c: In function 'mc_sysdev_remove':
arch/i386/kernel/microcode.c:745: error: 'suspend_cpu_hotplug' undeclared (first use in this function)
Given this, and the overall intrusiveness of the change, I'd worry about
trying to get this into 2.6.21.
