There isn't much we can do about that, memory is filled and your network
card tries to allocate memory in a mode that doesn't allow freeing some.
Looking at the timestamps its not very frequent, so it doesn't hurt
performance much if anything. If you're really bothered with this, you
could quiet it by sticking in a __GFP_NOWARN in __netdev_alloc_skb() or
something..
