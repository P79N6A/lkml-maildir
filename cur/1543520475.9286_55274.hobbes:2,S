Hi,
    I am recently having a problem with my clock and date functions
skewing time.  I know that my BIOS is okay because I have tested the
system under NT and al works fine.  It only happens under Linux and it
is always during the boot sequence.
    If I use either the clock or the date function to set the time the
system runs fine,  however due to certain circumstances I have to reboot
the system occasiionally.  When the system sets the system clock, the
time is off and skewed forward.  It is usually skewed forward about 30
minutes to 40 minutes and this is after I issue a reboot command.  If
I turn off my computer and leave it off for a few hours or days the
system clock is then skewed forward several days.  This morning when
I started my Linux box it was skewed forward to the 30th of Dec 1999.
I reset the clock and then rebooted and when the system came back it was
again ahead in time but this time only 30 minutes or so.
    I tried the same test and booting into Win NT and after setting the
time once I was able to reboot to NT and not have any problems with my
system time.
    Because I have recently just moved and am not completely set up I
must shut down my system occasionally.
    The only thing that has changed is that I have recently started
using kernel 2.2.13.  The system runs RH 6.0  and the clock gets set in
/etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit script.  When it boots and shows me the time it is
always faster than it should.
    Also there was one point that the date function was returning one
time and the clock function was returning another time.   Although this
is probably not a kernel bug, I am wondering if anyone here can help me
figure this out?
thanks..Joe
