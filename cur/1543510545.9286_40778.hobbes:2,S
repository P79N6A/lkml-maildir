Subject: Poor SMP performance with 2.3.18ac8

I am running 2.3.18ac8 on an ABit BP6 with dual Celeron 300s and 128MB
RAM. When running a uniprocessor kernel, the system performance is as
expected, but when running an SMP kernel, the system is generally slow and
clunky. My RC5 keyrates are half (or less) than they are when the
uniprocessor kernel is running. A quick look at the procinfo output
reveals the following:
irq  0:   6507260 timer                 irq  6:         3                      
irq  1:     25880 keyboard              irq 10:    277422 NE2000               
irq  2:         0 cascade [4]           irq 13:         1 fpu                  
irq  4:    128804 serial                irq 14:    229244 ide0                 
irq  5:  44716209 soundblaster          irq 15:         3 ide1
Doesn't the interrupt count for IRQ5 look a little high in comparison with
the timer count? Could this be an indication as to what's causing the poor
performance?
When the system is sitting idle in GNOME/Enlightenment with a couple of
xterms running, the load is in the 3-5 range which seems abnormal as well.
Any assistance is appreciated. I can provide any more additional
information as necessary.
Mike.
