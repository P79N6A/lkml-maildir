This is true, but if you are going to make a report, make a 
report, don't advocate changing something which works for 
most as it stands.  From the subject, one got the idea that 
people wanted to do some willy-nilly rearranging of the 
configure options.  The real issue here is that you really 
should *not* be copying 2.4 .config's over to a 2.5 tree. 
That way you'll be forced to go through all the options and 
get the proper "default" options for your platform enabled 
automatically.
Cheers,
Nicholas
