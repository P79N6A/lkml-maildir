I just uploaded 0.1.17 of Powertweak to 
http://powertweak.sourceforge.net
This fixes a bug where changing from a 2.4 kernel back to a 2.2 kernel
would cause hangs.
Development on this tree has stopped (asides bugfixes like this one),
as work is being done on the 0.99.x tree in CVS (more info same URL as
above). The first release of the new tree will follow sometime real soon.
regards,
Dave.
