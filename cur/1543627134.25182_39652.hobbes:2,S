No, I had not. I will though, and will report if this causes some change.
Everything looks fine for the first five minutes though.

Very interesting. I could do the same thing, and have a similar lock with
a PS/2 mouse. I will start looking in smplock.h if the MPS change does not
help.

I received the motherboard used, so I do not know if this is a recent
development. I have tried several other kernels which all show the same
locking behavior with PS/2 mice (2.4.17, 2.4.18, 2.5.7-dj3.) The previous
owner ran Windows XP (developer preview) on the board, and it had a
tendency to lock often, especially under high IO. I attributed this to
software issues, though now I wonder why the previous owner _really_ gave
it to me!
I have used a Tyan Tiger 100 with two processors and an Intel BX chipset,
with great success and no similar locks, so I am 50% certain that a
hardware difference is the root cause of the problem. Hopefully, someone
else will have seen similar problems.
