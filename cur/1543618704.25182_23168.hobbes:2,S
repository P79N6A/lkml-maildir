GFS uses (provide) a module which provides these symbols.
I don't know if this is still the case with their non-free software but
you can certainly find the last free GFS release.
You can have a look at 
   
http://www.sistina.com
but I guess that if they provide a way to get the last free release this
will not be a easy to find link.
Or at
   
http://www.opengfs.org
But IIRC these symbol were used only for the 2.2 kernel (that I assume
you are using?) and the support for 2.2 kernel was removed in the
opengfs fork.
