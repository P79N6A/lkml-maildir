Resend of the path_* API patches.  This is against the VFS cleanup
patches posted recently.
Description is in the first patch header.
Changes from the previous submission:
 - rename() API is made more symmetric
 - all impacted vfs_* functions are made static
Comments (not just Al's) are welcome ;)
Thanks,
Miklos
