| That would work, too. I do not get your comment about busybox.
Busybox is a bare minimum of unix tools, yet still includes things like
tar/bz2.  With such a system, you can use the most basic (sub-GNU)
versions of tools like cp, cat, sh, ls, and so on, to do much more
complex operations.  What's more, you can see everything you can do to a
file just by looking at it.  I can certainly imagine doing
	cat foo.tgz/metas/README
rather than a google search for tgz, followed by a "man tar" and "man
gzip". Assuming I know nothing about tar/gzip files, it's a lot easier
as a new user to have one common interface for everything -- including
docs.  Fewer commands to memorize, faster to learn new stuff.
