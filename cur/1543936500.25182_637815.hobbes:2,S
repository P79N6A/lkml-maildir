This won't let us get rid of the name attribute. As I repeatedly
explained, removing that file now would instantly break at least all
versions of lm-sensors before 3.0.0. This alone is enough to make it
unacceptable for the years to come.
Not to mention that this seems like a waste of kernel memory. The name
attribute certainly takes one order of magnitude less memory than
registering the same driver multiple times.
I'm not sure why you want these i2c chip names to go way, given that
the module aliases you'd like to add are almost the same, just in a
different form and using OF names instead of arbitrary names.
