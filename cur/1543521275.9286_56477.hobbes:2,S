Hi,

You can't do this. Suppose I poll for 20000 descriptors with a timeout.
You'll hang in that loop until the timeout expires until getting around
to checking the second batch of file descriptors.
Instead, you need to pass a linked list of descriptors to do_poll, ideally
using a linked list of single kernel pages. The big 128-kByte allocation
will fail anyway, if the machine is tight on memory.

Guillotine: The inventor, a French physician, J. I. Guillotin, thought his
invention was a great humanitarian contribution: a speedier and more efficient
method than the drawn-out tortures which had been used previously for
administering the death penalty.
