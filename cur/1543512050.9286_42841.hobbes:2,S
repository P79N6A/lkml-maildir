The devfs fans should listen to this guy.  I don't know all the details
but what he is saying sounds right; I've been here before and device
nodes should definitely be handled in their own way, they aren't files,
they are devices.
But even that's not the main point.  The main point which he is making
is that you need to think hard about the file system interfaces and the
semantics of those interfaces.  I dunno if he's right or wrong about
devfs tying the VFS' hands, it's certainly plausible, but I'll let the
devfs guys argue that point.  However, if he's right, that's the best
anti-devfs argument I've heard in this whole thread.
One last comment: as far as I can tell, most people aren't against devfs,
they are against the current implementation.  The basic idea is useful at
some level.  If that is correct, perhaps you're all arguing about nothing
(not that I've ever done that; sigh).
