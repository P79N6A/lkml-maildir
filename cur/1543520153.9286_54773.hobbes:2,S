Hi all,
I'm a new kernel programmer at the networking layer. Just to start, I've
been looking at the IP and TCP headers and taking out some performance
statistics such as number of packets/bytes rx and tx per connections or
number of connections in order to access a web page,... Now I would like
to extract info from the payload. More specifically, I would like to be
able to read the contents of the http fields. Reading the contents of
the TCP or IP headers was easy since from the linux network source code
I can get the iphdr (e.g. iphdr->ttl) and tcphdr structs. But I don't
know the way that the http fields are stored in the TCP payload.
Does anybody knows how can I get to sniff the info inside the TCP
payload for the case that this one is carrying an HTTP message without
having to access the (e.g.) Netscape source code itself but by just
coding at the linux networking source code level?
Thanks a lot!!
Jordi
