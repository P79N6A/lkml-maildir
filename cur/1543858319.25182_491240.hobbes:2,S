sorry - I should be a little more context specific.
for KERNEL modules that used the _syscallX macros - what mechanism should be used?
I'm aware that the drivers I'm having a problem with (ATI, vmware) are closed source - but my own work machine's dependant on it and I'm not going to waste another 3 months to get
a response from either company.
and since the macros were pulled...  and I'm kind of stuck with bleeding edge until some of the other hardware I'm working with is supported...  *frustrated sigh*
At the moment my workaround is just to copy the macros from released kernel in.   I don't like that solution - but it DOES work.
Unless someone can suggest a low-price but recent - and still sold - laptop model that works well with linux.  (rhetorical - if anyone DOES answer, keep it off the list - thanks *g*)
