Subject: [patch 21/21] slab defrag: Obsolete SLAB
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/5/9/408

Slab defragmentation introduces new functionality not supported by SLAB and
SLOB.
Make slab depend on EXPERIMENTAL and note its obsoleteness and that
various functionality is not supported by SLAB.
Also update SLOB's description a bit to indicate that certain OS
support is limited by design.
