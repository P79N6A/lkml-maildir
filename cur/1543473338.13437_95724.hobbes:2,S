That last-minute Intel smp patch necessitates fixups on
the Alpha side as well.
I also tried to streamline handle_ipi, send_ipi_message
and send_cpu_message.  Jay, if you could verify at your
convenience that I have not somehow flubbed that, I 
would be grateful.  Those are the couple of bits that I
can't actually test from running a single cpu.
