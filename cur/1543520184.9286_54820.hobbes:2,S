Do you have:
#ifndef CONFIG_VMDUMP
#define CONFIG_VMDUMP
#include <linux/vmdump.h>
#endif
at the top of the file?  This might be needed if you're compiling the
new vmdump.o, but you don't have CONFIG_VMDUMP set.  Just a thought.
If that file gets built, it's because CONFIG_VMDUMP is in the object.
Look at arch/i386/kernel/Makefile for an example:
ifdef CONFIG_VMDUMP
O_OBJS += vmdump.o
endif
