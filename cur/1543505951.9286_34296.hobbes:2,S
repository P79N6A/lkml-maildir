   hi,i'm a software engineer for linux.
   Ginius GF100 net Adapter is one of the products by my company.
   It uses rtl8139 chip,so we can use rtl8139.c to drive it.
   1:
   My question is how can i make the GF100 net adapter item appear
   in the options of net adapter installation?
   May i ask for linus or distributor?
   2:
   Another question :the kernel image -- vmlinuz,which size is about 600k 
   for linux 2.2.5,but when i made the image by myself,which size is even 
   over 1M.the lilo told me "the image is too big".
   i wonder if the "make "command has some option to reduce the image      
size or other method?
   ps:my cpu is intel,linux 2.2.5
   thanks
