Hi,
I spend lot's of hours to figure that my kernel need hdx=remap to 
understand EZD disk.
It was very long because I had to figure it have something to do with 
EZD and then find the solution (easy).
If EZD drive are not remapped, why in fs/partitions/msdos.c, there 
aren't some info in case of EZD driver about hdx=remap option ?
Futhermore it will much cleanner to panic in this case, as log spaming 
could mask the message.
