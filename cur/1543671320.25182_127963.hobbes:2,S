This starts to get very long over time, and quite messy, and pretty much
is pointless.  I used to do it for my drivers, but have given up due to
no one ever reading it, and the advent of bitkeeper (you can get
individual revision history for every file now quite easily.)

This is already listed in the MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE and can be parsed
later by userspace tools quite easily.
