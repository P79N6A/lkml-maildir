Hello, Ravi.
First of all, it usually attracts more people if you include full source 
code of something runnable.

Yeap, both cfq and anticipatory pause queue processing to improve 
performance.  This is a bit counter-intuitive at first but the loooong 
seek time justifies such pauses if they can reduce seeks.

After such pauses, cfq does the needed 'nudging' by itself.  cfq has 
changed quite a bit so I might be mistaken but such 'nudging' ends up 
calling blk_start_queueing() which either runs request_fn directly or 
unplug the queue if plugged.  So, does your driver's queue have proper 
unplug function?  How is your queue initialized?  (you can see why it's 
much better to post full working source.)
