Randy, maybe it is totally irrelevant but I also used to get an oops in
swapper but for a very understandable and well-defined reason. Namely I
use a serial console, do you? I used to use serial console at 9600 speed
which was slow enough (on a 4-cpu box) for NMI watchdog to detect the
"lockup" and force an oops. Changing the setting to 38400 fixed the
"problem". I am just mentioning it on the odd chance that same happens to
you...
