I remember this nice thread a month ago about the difficulty on installing
Linux on VAIO's (due to the CDROM using a PCcard driver, and ports being
USB).
The new 505SX model seems really neat - integrated 10/100 ethernet and
modem, 128 mb ram, p2/366 and all. Has anyone tried installing Linux on
one ? It should be possible to boot from the USB floppy maybe, and then
install over the built-in ethernet, if that is supported. Is it ? :)
