This bit?
define rule_vmlinux__
        set -e
        $(if $(filter .tmp_kallsyms%,$^),,
          echo '  Generating build number'
          . $(src)/scripts/mkversion > .tmp_version
          mv -f .tmp_version .version
          $(Q)$(MAKE) $(build)=init
        )
        $(call cmd,vmlinux__)
        echo 'cmd_$@ := $(cmd_vmlinux__)' > $(@D)/.$(@F).cmd
endef
Is it possible to define $(SINGLE_MAKE) or something as well as $(MAKE),
where it strips the -j, and use that in the instances where it can't
take a -j? Would be nice to get rid of that one last warning ... ;-)
