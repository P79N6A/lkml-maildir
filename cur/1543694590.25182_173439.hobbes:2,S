Greetings!
Mohammed Al-Foudari has created a ThinkGeek.com wish list and 
has sent this e-mail to you to tell you about it.
If you think they deserve it, you may follow the link provided below to
see what they have in their wishlist. You may also select any of the
items for purchase. Don't worry about buying a double for them, our
software will tell you what items have already been purchased so that 
you can avoid being the tenth person to give them a copy of the same book.
To view Mohammed's wish list, simply click on (or copy) this URL:

Your fellow smart masses,
Jen, Jon, Scott, Willie, JenH, Chris, Mat, Andy, John & Trevor
