There is no enforcing advantage for this.
newbie question: how to provide file operations like poll
without an entry in the filesystem? (in the meantime I will try
to answer this myself :)

Still you can open a file in the namespace and write some commands to it.
Then it turns out to be a socket on port 25:
fd=open("/dev/socket",O_RDWR);
write(fd,"connect stream 25\n",sizeof(..));
write(fd,"helo mail.my.com\n",..);
...
Just one more question: would it be possible to specify a poll operation
for /proc/blah?
