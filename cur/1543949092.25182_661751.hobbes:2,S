This still leaves us with the workqueue interface:
__create_workqueue_key
destroy_workqueue
flush_workqueue
queue_work
ndiswrapper has its own workqueue implementation, but it would be great
to avoid code duplication.
As for task_nice(), it's strange that task_nice() is GPLONLY, but
set_user_nice() is not.  Anyway, it can probably be worked around.
