if a repository is corrupted then it pretty much needs to be dropped 
anyway. Also, with a 'replicate the full object on every 8th commit' 
rule the risk would be somewhat mitigated as well.
but yeah, i can very much see the point of trying to avoid that 
complexity. (Also, it's not like delta blobs couldnt be introduced later 
on, if there's enough (if any) pressure to reduce storage overhead.)
