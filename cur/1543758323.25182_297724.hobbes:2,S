I have seen something similar on S3 cards with bad video ram (we had
>3 of them). If it survives soft reboot... well, that looks like
hardware problem to me. [We may do something bad in linux, too, but
strange effects should not survive reboot, that's hw bug. I'd suggest
memtest on video ram, but someone would need to write that tool, first].
