Hello
With 2.5.69-mm3
<0> Kernel panic: Fatal exception in interrupt.In interrupt handler - not
syncing.
I couldn't put the hole message because it's bigger than the screen size.
This happens when running killall5 in the shutdown (rc.6) script
I'll try to boot with console lp0 and see if I can get it on printer
Config and programs version attached. Kernel compiled with gcc-3.2.3
but happens even when compiled with gcc-2.95.3
