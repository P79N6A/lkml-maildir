how is this one different from PT_GNU_STACK

do you actually need this? the number of apps that have actual
trampolines is *really really* low. At that point you get to a balance
between complexity and very limited added security. And the answer is
really not straight forward since complexity is a security risk in
itself; or more direct, by allowing this at all you in theory can open
other security holes. (note the "can" here. I'm not saying the
implementation does, but there sure is added complexity which in turn
means added chances for bugs. If the number of things that need this is
really low (and it should be) the balance isn't so clear).

This one could in theory be useful. However need info on what breaks. I
know that if you do full blown ES/PaX level randomisation the build
process of some older emacsen, and build process won't benefit from such
a flag unless you can make the toolchain insert it automatic (I suspect
that will be hard); once it's manual and during build only using setarch
is sufficient to cover that one.

Is this what PIE would be for? Eg if you change binaries why not just
change them to be PIE ?

Actually SELinux currently has stuff for this. Does this need to be in
the binary or would SELinux policy be enough (I assume that any hardened
linux distro nowadays also enables selinux so this question is quite
relevant).

actually fc4 and such don't have that many markings so I wonder what the
usefulness is. (most of the spurious markings we had in the past were
due to assembly files not being correctly marked, not due to recursive
functions)

eh yeah need coffee ;)

since you duplicate PT_GNU_STACK exactly it seems (well inverse meaning
but a ! in C is cheap) I think there's no point in obsoleting
PT_GNU_STACK. I realize some people see PT_GNU_STACK as an Exec-Shield
thing and thus evil, but lets ignore all that politics and stick to
facts here: No need to obsolete/remove existing things if they're not
broken and are good enough.
