IIRC NUMA-Q can be dynamically detected at boot by means of an MP OEM
table's presence, in particular if there's a matching string in the 8B
OEM record in the OEM table, with a value of "IBM NUMA" IIRC. This is
probably a line or two's worth of change to mpparse.c and declaring a
variable for clustered_apic_mode. If it were difficult to detect, I
wouldn't have suggested implementing it (though do so at your leisure). =)
I still think this is 2.5 material + backport once it gets testing there.
