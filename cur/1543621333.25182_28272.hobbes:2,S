Not sure if your the one to contact, but compiling 2.5.5pre1 errored out
compiling the ramdisk driver in /drivers/block/rd.c because it is still
using bi_end_io with the nr_sectors Argument.  I simply removed the
nr_sectors arg to make the kernel compile past that point.  I don't know if
that's the right route to go, but wanted to let someone know. 
Thanks,
Bruce H.
