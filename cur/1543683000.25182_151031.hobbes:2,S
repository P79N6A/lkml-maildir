Yeah the bit about "Nasal Sex with Dead Plants" just makes one wonder, is
a rose just a rose?  (note to self, don't read RMS's diary again)
Has anyone ever asked why it is okay for RMS to suggest it is okay to
invalidate another person/company license (BitKeeper is the example) yet
become offended when their own license is to desired to be invalidated?
Why is it that nothing but gpl can exist with gpl?
Why is that a superior option to license under which follows the
original spirit of GPL but goes further to promote the ideas of open
source is frowned upon?
Maybe it has something to do with self pollenation.
Cheers,
