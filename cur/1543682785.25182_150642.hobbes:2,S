I just patched my tree and compiled it. It does not work.. It freezes
the system when I try to start X.. I gives a huge error message and
the last line is something like :
<6>note: X[1306] exited with preempt_count 1
I checked all the logs and I cannot find the complete error message
anywhere. Any suggestions where to look? 
I also had to set root=0307 instead of /dev/hda7 to make it boot. But
I guess that is unrelated to this issue..
