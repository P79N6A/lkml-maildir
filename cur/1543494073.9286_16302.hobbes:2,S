I know that it has been suggested in the past that the jiffies counter
should be set so that it rolls over within about 10 minutes to make
everything that has a problem with this break.  Maybe looking back with
20/20 hindsight we should have done this in the 2.1.x series.  Perhaps in
2.3.x??? 
I'll probably go ahead and do this on my laptop and see what explodes in
my face ;)
