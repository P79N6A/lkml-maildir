The race happens between pid_revalidate() and proc_pid_environ(). When
sys_execve() is called, you get into prepare_binprm() which first checks
the i_mode flags and the owner of the file to be executed and later
tries to read the file.
When a process is set non-dumpable, its files are owned by root:root
while permissions are kept, and the "environ" file also gets non-readable
for everyone.
The owner is basically set by proc_revalidate(), the check whether
"environ" may be read happens in proc_pid_environ() (the call to
ptrace_may_attach() to be exact).
Now prepare_binprm() first gets owner and permissions, which are
root:root and 04755 respectively, permissions were changed regularly,
owner was set to root:root, because the process is non-dumpable.
Later prepare_binprm() actually tries to read /proc/$PID/environ and
usually this would fail, because the process is non-dumpable. Now, if
the syscall gets preempted in between these two, you can change the
process back to be dumpable, the read succeeds and that's it.
