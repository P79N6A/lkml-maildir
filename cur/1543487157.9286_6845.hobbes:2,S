It won't, but you can coax the NT boot code into booting LILO.
Basically, the boot= option in LILO should point to your Linux
partition (not to the MBR), then after each run of LILO you need to dd
the LILO boot sector to a file on your FAT (or NTFS, if you're gutsy)
partition that you then specify in your boot.ini (I think it's called)
file...
