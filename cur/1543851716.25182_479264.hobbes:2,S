This has almost nothing to do with elapsed time.
How about doing, in free_pages_bulk():
	if (zone->over_interleave_pages) {
		zone->over_interleave_pages = 0;
		node_clear(zone_to_nid(zone), full_interleave_nodes);
	}
?

Well it grossly changes the meaning of "interleaving".  We might as well
call it something else.  It's not necessarily worse, but it's not
interleaved any more.
Actually by staying on the same node for a string of successive allocations
it could well be quicker.  How come MPOL_INTERLEAVE doesn't already do some
batching?   Or does it, and I missed it?
