This is in Doc*/power/kernel_threads.txt:
KERNEL THREADS
Freezer
Upon entering a suspended state the system will freeze all
tasks. This is done by delivering pseudosignals. This affects
kernel threads, too. To successfully freeze a kernel thread
the thread has to check for the pseudosignal and enter the
refrigerator. Code to do this looks like this:
        do {
                hub_events();
                wait_event_interruptible(khubd_wait,
!list_empty(&hub_event_list));
                try_to_freeze();
        } while (!signal_pending(current));
...do you know about better place?
