Hello,
    During the last stage of make modules_install on 2.4.3-ac9, I received the following:
depmod: *** Unresolved symbols in /lib/modules/2.4.3-ac9/kernel/net/wanrouter/af_wanpipe.o
depmod: wanpipe_mark_bh
depmod: wanpipe_queue_tq
depmod: wanpipe_find_card
Regards,
Frank
The previous build steps seemed to work without problems:
