Um, what about delivering a SIGSEGV?  So, copy_to/from_user always
returns 0, but a signal is delivered.  Then the only places which need
to be clever are the mount option copying, and the signal delivery
code for SIGSEGV (which uses copy_to_user).
This has the benefit of not breaking existing kernel code, whichever
interpretation of the return value is used.

That's certainly possible,
Rusty.
