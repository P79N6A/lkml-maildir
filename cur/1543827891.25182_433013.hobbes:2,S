When i submitted this patch, i didn't really think about the different
ways to export these symbols. I simply used the EXPORT_SYMBOL() that is 
used by all the other exports in net/socket.c including kernel_sendmsg()
and kernel_recvmsg().
I am OK with either option(EXPORT_SYMBOL or EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL) and i will
leave it to David Miller to make that decision at this point.
Thanks
