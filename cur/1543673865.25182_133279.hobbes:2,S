Bullshit. Try it. So called Linux 9 /Professional did **NOT** allow
anybody to break in. Maybe you didn't try it, or maybe it wasn't
tested in a machine that uses initrd to make the hard disk accessible,
but it absolutely positively fails to run any 'init' when the LILO boot
is interrupted and we entered, in addition to the linux OS label, the
parameter init=/bin/bash. We even tried, probably nearly a hundred
boots, over two days various things like init=/bin/csh.... various
possible shells, plus init=/sbin/init 1, etc. Any time 'init' was
defined on the boot command-line, the machine would panic with
'attempting to kill init'.
Also, when booting on the distribution media, the ALF-F2...F5  keys
no longer function so you can't access a shell. Try it before you
claim I'm "mis-informed". I wasted an entire weekend until I took
the damn hard disk out, brought it home, and "fixed" it.
Cheers,
