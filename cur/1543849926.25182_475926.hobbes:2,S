well, if it is the right thing to do, why not doing it. (note: I don't
claim it's the right thing to do though). Futhermore such change is
going to move a lot of files _but_ if after the move it compiles, then
it works...

So, to sum up, if I have a lcd named 'foo_lcd' which use 4 ks0108
controllers (256x128), and want to make your fb driver work on it, I
need to copy your  cfag12864b.c file, rename it to foo_lcd256128.c and
just change the number of controllers, is that correct ?

well you actually haven't answered to the initial question... I
suspect it won't work since you haven't setup "info->fix.smem_start"
anywhere. But I may be wrong since I don't know fb code.
