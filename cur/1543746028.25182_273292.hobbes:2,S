varargs is implemented entirely by GCC (GCC owns the stdarg.h header
and implements the builtin functions that are used in the va_* macros).
You can call va_start on the same args list twice, both:
void foo (int x, ...)
{
  va_list ap, ap2;
  va_start (ap, x);
  va_start (ap2, x);
...
  va_end (ap);
  va_end (ap2);
}
and
void foo (int x, ...)
{
  va_list ap;
  va_start (ap, x);
...
  va_end (ap);
  va_start (ap, x);
...
  va_end (ap);
}
are ok.  What you can't do is e.g.
  va_list ap;
  va_start (ap, x);
  bar (x, ap);
  bar (x, ap);
  va_end (ap);
(i.e. once you pass the ap to some other function, the only thing that you
have to do with it in the caller is va_end).
