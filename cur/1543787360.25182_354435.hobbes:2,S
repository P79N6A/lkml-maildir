as DervishD already explained, the kernel driver doesn't, but lasers can 
easily cause severe irreversible eye damage. doesn't matter if you actually 
*see* the laser beam. NEVER use a non-closed cd drive (either standard simple 
stereo units or dvd burners, they all present similar dangers). most drives 
have hardware safety features that disable all lasers when tray is open, but 
some other may not...
