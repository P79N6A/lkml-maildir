Hello.
Since linux-2.4.5 always the same errors occur sporadically after the cold boot
     in the morning. (My computer is powered off during the night.) Every second
day I noticed my syslog sais something like the  following:
Aug 21 09:01:06 adlib kernel: EXT2-fs error (device ide0(3,5)): ext2_new_block:
Allocating block in system zone - block = 3

Today it destroyed my super block and all my root-directories were placed in
/lost+found. I rescued everything with e2fsck-1.14 from a very old rescue-disk
and then again with 1.23, renaming and replacing the directories by hand. A lot
of devices and some .h-files were not recoverable.
These fatal errors are occuring since 2.4.5 (2.4.8 I've not tested.). When I
work with 2.4.4 everything is fine !
I already use the newest version of e2fsck (1.23) and util-linux (2.11f). My
RedHat (Rotkäppchen) 6.2 is rather old, but I don't like gcc 2.96 at all.
I posted this report as the errors occured after a complete crash with 2.4.6
also to the ext2-developers directly but they didn't answered.
Maybe you could help me here ?
