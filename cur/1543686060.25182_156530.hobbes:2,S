I have a couple uniprocessor ICH5 systems from different vendors, with 
similar behavior:
2.6:  HyperThreading works, ACPI works, all irqs properly routed
2.4:  HT works only works with ACPI enabled, but,
       ACPI kills the irq routing for the external PCI slots.
       pci=noacpi or whatever doesn't work.  !CONFIG_ACPI + "noapic"
       fixes irq routing, but then no HT sibling appears.
It seems like kernel 2.4.22-rc is missing some ACPI and possibly some 
APIC fixes?
