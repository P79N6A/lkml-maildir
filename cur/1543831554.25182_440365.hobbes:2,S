I believe that implementing RAID in the filesystem has many benefits too:
 - multiple RAID levels: store metadata in triple-mirror RAID 1, random 
write intensive data in RAID 1, bulk data in RAID 5/6
 - improved write throughput - since stripes can be variable size, any 
large enough write fills a whole stripe

Do not meddle in the internals of kernels, for they are subtle and quick to panic.
