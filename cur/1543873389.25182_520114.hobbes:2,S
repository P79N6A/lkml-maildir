Not really for compatibility, its the numerical values that matter.
iproute hasn't been changed to use the FRA_* attributes for routing
rules, but it might be a good idea to do this before adding the next
RTA_* attribute since RTA_FWMASK doesn't have any meaning for routes
in the kernel, so the next RTA attribute we add could just use the
same value instead of leaving a hole.
