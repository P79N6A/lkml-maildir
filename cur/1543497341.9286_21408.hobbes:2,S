Hello,
running 2.3.4 I get the following message:
wait_on_bh, CPU 1
irq: 0 [0 0]
bh:  1 [1 0]
<[c0109625]> <[c01627b1]> <[c016d5a6]> <[c0174973]> <[c015e1cf]> <[c0174e06]>
I tried to look up those values in my System.map but there are no exact
matches. So I'll attach my System.map to this message. My system is
dual P133
128MB
SMC EtherPower II (epic100.c is 1.06)
Tonight I'll rebuild a kernel with the original epic100.c driver (1.04).
If you need further informations just let me know.
Regards,
   Jogi
