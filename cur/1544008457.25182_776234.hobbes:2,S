Actually, I'm fine with taking it out. But when we register a function 
graph, we register both a entry and exit. I would think it should still 
work if one was still set as the default. Unless we document it someplace 
that either the entry or exit must be set.
This change has the function graph work if one or the other is set to 
something other than the default.
Also, this is only in the static ftrace path, not dynamic, but then again, 
maybe that means it is even hotter.
I'm fine with pulling this out. It was not really needed, I was just 
trying to make it intuitive.
