Well you just might know everything, but with some versions of
gcc, I have found it necessary to use -I`gcc --print-file-name=include`
on the command line. On this system it is:
Script started on Sat Jul 24 19:58:12 2004
# gcc --print-file-name=include
/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/i686-pc-linux-gnu/egcs-2.91.66/include
# exit

And it isn't a mis-configured gcc although some versions of gcc
don't always do what you are expecting.
Cheers,
