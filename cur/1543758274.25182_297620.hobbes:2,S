Yeah, your case could check for zero in the physical sector stuff too, but 
I'm not sure that matters, since nobody really cares about the physical 
values and they've long been too limited to matter. So I'm not at all 
convinced that adding a few more checks for zero would be any better than 
checking the one zero that Andries does.
I think Andries' patch is fine. We should probably do the same for the 
extended partition case, just to be consistent.
