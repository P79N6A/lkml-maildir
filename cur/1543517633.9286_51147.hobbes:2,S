Hi,
Thanks for your comments.
1. Coda's ctime not set on create is a bug -- I'll send a fix with the
other 2.3 fixes we will do over the next week or so.
2. Hard links across directories are not permitted.  Jan explained that
security is an issue here.  
I think there is wrong thinking in the way Unix does things normally and
the security argument goes away when the following reasoning is followed.
Unix pretends a hard link is merely a modification of a directory. Of
course it does add a name to new directory but it also subtly alters the
attributes of the file in question, since it raises the file's link count.
A perfectly acceptable fix for the (many) problems with link are to permit
links only if:
 - the process can write to the target directory
 - process can modify the attributes of the file it wants to link 
This would work fine in Coda and also solves the problem that arise from
people keeping hardlinks to insecure suid programs, since they normally
cannot change their attributes.
Would Aegis be happy with that?   Would Linux in general?
