At some point in the past, I wrote:

I'm not entirely surprised at this, CONFIG_HIGHMEM is probably just
not quite a strict enough criterion for eliminating ->virtual as it's
a time/space tradeoff that just happens to be bad on ppc64. Maybe we
should figure out some other criterion in addition to it.
