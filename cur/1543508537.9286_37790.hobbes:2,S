1. I hope that someone follows through on the BSD like poll()
optimization.
2. This declare/event API is one of the coolest things I've seen in
years!
I've always found select() is quite kludgy and poll() seemed
inefficient.
However, I'm not really sure I like the API label
(declare_fd() & get_next_fd() would be my suggestion).
This is so cool I wouldn't mind implementing it myself.  Does anyone
else think they can get a 2.3.17 based patch ready by the end of next
week? ;)
We _should_ be able to match the performance of Solaris 7 and AIX 4.3.3
even without this new API.  With this API Linux will have the
_potential_
for unbeatable network performance!
