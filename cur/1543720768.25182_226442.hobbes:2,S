I think the mentioned error is not dependent on any specific interface
(let it be eth0, or ppp0), but any interface in general which has a
routing entry and is the target/source of IP traffic. This is based on
the fact that my fixes play with the refcounting on any interface. not
just eth0 specifically, and pertain to both IPv4 and IPv6 core.
However, I detected this behavior on my eth0, since this is the only
interface I have on my laptop. You just can try both patches against
2.6.7-rc3 or 2.6.7-rc3-mm1 to see if them cure your problems.

In my case, I was able to trigger the problem by running "cardctl eject"
which was then stuck at D state. Killing any program using a network
socket, and waiting for opened connections to transition from
ESTABLISHED to TIME_WAIT and then being closed, allowed "cardctl" to
exit the D state.
