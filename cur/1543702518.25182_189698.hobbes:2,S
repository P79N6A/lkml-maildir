Hi,
I was wondering if there is a way to make the boot-process look 
StarWars-like:
   		lalallaal
  	llalalallalalalalalalalalala
lalalalalalalaalallalalalalalalalallala
and let it scroll up the screen. I would think that this could be done 
with the Framebuffer-Device. Maybe something like fblogo or so.
Thanks,
Niels

Supremest Wisdom, and primeval Love.
Before me things create were none, save things
Eternal, and eternal I endure.
All hope abandon, ye who enter here.
