I'm still looking at doing work in the tty layer but it is turning out
to be more complex that I initially thought. I may give removing the
BLK another attempt when I understand things better.
I have all of the lock debugging turned on in my kernel. I did get
nice messages when I did dumb things like sleeping with locks held or
deadlocking that led to quickly fixing the code. Much better than the
old system of freezing the box up.
