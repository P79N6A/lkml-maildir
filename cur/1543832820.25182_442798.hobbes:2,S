Sorry but is a Windows solution the best on the whole world?
Is there any problem to imagine an abstract sound device which virtually 
always works but uses real device chosen by user, network redirection or 
  emulating work and we have some control panel/app which can control 
connections/plugins/redirections etc. (also this can be done by some 
kind of daemon responding to hw change events)?
Do we really need to program every sound app to have device setting code?

So why they are still exist in so many Linux distributions?

Format changing, resampling, mixing and supporting additional plugins
does not seems to be just low level HAL for hw device. It creates some 
kind of virtual functionality which means more then this provided by 
hardware device itself.
