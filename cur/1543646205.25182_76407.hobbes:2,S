The kernel has such locks too, no big deal

not to bad...

ehm sys_spipe doesn't exist, neither do all but 2 of the others you
showed.

iBCS is dead. It's called linux-abi nowadays.....

Profilers don't actually NEED this.... OProfile is fixed for this for
example in the 2.5 branch. 
Taking over "random" unimplemented system calls really sounds bad..... I
mean, for the next minor release of the kernel Linus can assign that
number to something official and different......
