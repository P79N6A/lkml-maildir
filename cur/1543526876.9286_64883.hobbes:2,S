linux-2.0.x should only be compiled with gcc-2.7.2.3, later ones are risky
(and the compile may bomb). egcs-1.1.2 and gcc-2.95.2 _should_ be OK with
2.2.x and 2.3.x, but there seem to be some areas where they generate wrong
code left. YMMV.
Latest kernels (2.3.47pre at least) crash egcs and latest gcc's, the fix
was placed into the CVS master repository for gcc a couple of days
back. 2.7.2.3 works, as a workaround for a different bug there works around
this one too ;-)
