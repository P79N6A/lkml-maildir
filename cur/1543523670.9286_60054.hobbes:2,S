rmb() is broken on PPC. Not really broken, but it does a sync, which is a
_huge_ overkill and which should be avoided except when interrupt synchro
or SMP synchro must be acheived.

Hum. It should be there. Did I miss this when you asked my about your
patch, Brad ? I Need some more sleep ...
More simply, I beleive you can directly use readl/writel instead of using
your own asm accessors. (Yours allow to use the index regiser. So they
may actually be good for perfs).

I don't completely agree. Putting them before or after is a matter of
style. The rare cases where this actually matters must usually be
hand-tuned. (For example, filling some HW cursor datas in the
framebuffer, so without using eieio, and then writing a register that
will cause the chip to use those datas. One eieio is needed before the
write in this case. I tend personally to prefer having them before.
Again, rmb() is evil on PPC since it does a sync, which is, I think, very
expensive on recent PPC CPUs.

Optimisation ? Doing so this way allow to use the 2 parameters of the
stwbrx/lwbrx instrutions for the base and the index. That means that the
compiler can store the register base address in one register, and keep it
there all the time, changing only the offset in a second register.

Right.
