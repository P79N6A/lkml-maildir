Not to interested in the BIOS versions anymore. As the tyan boards in
question have been rma'd I'm not exactly sure whats going on with them
now. The tyan boards I have in here right now appear to work properly
except for the pmd issue, i've noticed nothing wrong with them besides
that. 
What we need is to try and single out the variables that are causing the
badpmd's. Also the more people who report badpmd's with Andi Kleen's
intial patch the better. Especially on different archs; would also be
good. So far from lkml i'm only seeing Tyan S28* boards as of recent.
