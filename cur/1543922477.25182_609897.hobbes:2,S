modeled means copied and modified, right?
This is wrong. I compared efi_32.c and efi_64.c and a large amount of
the code is simply the same. The small details can be sorted out by
two sets of macros/inline functions easily.
Please fix this up.

Why needs this to be called lin2win? We do not call Windows, we call
EFI services, so please use a naming convention which is related to
the functionality of the code.

Again, these are wrappers to access EFI and not Windows.
