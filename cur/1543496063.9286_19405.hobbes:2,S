I'm sorry; I think we're talking about two different issues here.  We
have established:
1. POSIX requirements don't apply here.
2. The current VFS doesn't handle it correctly.
3. This is necessary for reasonable behaviour.
Conclusion:
a. The VFS interface need to change.
I don't see why this implies multiple dentries for a directory.
