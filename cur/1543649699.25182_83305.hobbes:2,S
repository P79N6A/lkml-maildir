Let me give you an example of what would be illegal.
Using this netif_rx() hook to implement a proprietary TCP stack
to replace the GPL'd one in the kernel right now.  And that is exactly
the reason I want any such netif_rx  function pointer crap to be
EXPORT_GPL
And before someone, I forget who it was, barks again, EXPORT_GPL has
no legal significance, it is merely an annotation.  Whether a symbol
is marked this way or not has no consequence on legal matters.
