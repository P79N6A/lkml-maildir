  Hi, all. Version 146 of my devfs patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
The devfs FAQ is also available here.
This work has been sponsored by SGI.
This is against 2.3.31. Highlights of this release:
- Removed obsolete DEVFS_FL_COMPAT and DEVFS_FL_TOLERANT flags
- Fixed compile problem with fs/coda/psdev.c
- Reinstate change to <devfs_register_blkdev> in
  drivers/block/ide-probe.c now that fs/isofs/inode.c is fixed
- Switched to <devfs_register_blkdev> in drivers/block/floppy.c,
  drivers/scsi/sr.c and drivers/block/md.c
- Moved DAC960 devices to /dev/dac960
				Regards,
					Richard....
