Yes there are actually two projects by SGI that also ran into the same 
issue that motivated the work on this. One is XPmem which allows 
sharing of process memory between different Linux instances and then 
there is the GRU which is a kind of DMA engine. Then there is KVM and 
probably multiple other drivers.
