I think (2) *is* going to be more complex than (1). More code and more
data. And for what benefit? Not that many people have multiple video
cards, and those who do probably have CPUs with >2 MTRRs. Even the el
cheapo Centaurs have 8. Time for AMD to pull their finger out...
Anyway, once my current patch gets applied, I can ponder this more
closely. One step at a time.
