The "struct dm_io *io" that is passed to dec_pending() can be accessed by 
multiple threads at the same time, thus some form of locking is required.
I had been thinking about whether the "error" field could be an atomic_t, 
which would remove the requirement for the spinlock in dec_pending(). 
However, I don't know how atomic_t's behave with negative values. I know 
atomic_t's are only guaranteed to have 24-bits of precision, yet all arch's 
define atomic_t with a signed integer. Can anyone enlighten me on this?
Perhaps we could make "error" and atomic_t, and store the absolute-value of 
the error code, and always return -error in the bio_endio() call. Or is that 
just too ugly?
