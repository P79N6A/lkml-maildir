Yes, we do need better driver support.  But that's nothing that udev
itself can do :)
I have a number of patches pending for 2.6.1 that will add more driver
support for sysfs.

The people keeping the klibc kernel bk tree have enough support in it to
place udev into initramfs.  Again, nothing that udev needs to do for
this.

We now support wildcards in udev.permissions, forgot to mention that in
the 006 release.  So it's just a matter of distros building up a
permissions file that matches their needs.

Mostly it's a implementation issue with a distro to get everything tied
together properly.  Much like devfs had issues when it was added to the
kernel and people had to tweak userspace a bunch to get it to work
properly.

Initial setup will be done by distros when they implement it into their
system.  What do you mean by "lack of functionality"?  What users are
telling you this, and what functions are they?  Please feel free to
forward them on to me, otherwise I will not know...
Now yes, I do know that udev still has a way to go to be solid and
mature, but it is usable for the most part :)
