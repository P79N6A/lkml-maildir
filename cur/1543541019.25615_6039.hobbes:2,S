	Donald, thanks for taking the time to respond to my email, and I am
sorry that it has taken me a week to respond to yours.  I wanted to
try a few things with your National Semiconductor DP38815 driver
first.  I have made only a little progress, but I figure I owe you a
reply already.

     I don't know ACPI other than having a vague understanding that
there is no ACPI BIOS on the hardware platform on which this driver
must work.

       Thanks.  I have updated your section of the credits in the
2.4.0-test5 driver to indicate that it appears to be derived from
your code.  (My current working copies of my attempts to port both
the Wyse/TeamF1 version and yours are in
ftp://ftp.yggdrasil.com/private/adam/ethernet/
 if anybody is interested.)

	The only calls to udelay(2000) that I see are when the hardware
is being reset, a hopefully a rare event.  However, I agree it would be
good to determine if those 2ms delays can be eliminated.
	Anyhow, here is the current status of my relatively novice
attemps at porting these two drivers to the PCI-based facilities of
2.4.0-test5:
	natsemi.c (Don's driver) - This driver used {read,write}{b,w,l}
to memory addresses that apparently mapped into IO ports, which the
2.4.0-testX kernels discourage strongly by printing a warning every
time it happens.  (I guess this ability is going to be removed.)
Changing the code to use {in,out}{b,w,l} has not worked as far as I
can tell, even though the IO addresses appear to be correct, and I
have verified that porting the TeamF1 routine for reading the mac
address into this driver works (and in this style of this driver), so
the board is alive.
	dp83815.c (Wyse/NatSemi/TeamF1 driver) - This driver works but
is buggy.  Most notably, emacs takes longer and longer to save a file
when this is my ethernet driver, until the delays become intolerable
(presumably this probably operates through NFS).  The driver used to
occasionally segfault at initialization, but I am pretty sure that was
due to my not null terminating the table of PCI ID's.  That is fixed now.
	My more recent efforts have been aimed at getting natsemi.c
working, but I think I am going to take a look at the other
TeamF1/Natsemi-based dp83815 drivers that John Halewood and Ian Nelson
sent me, and see if that exposes the problem in dp83815.c.
	Anyhow, if anyone wants to take a look at this work in progress,
both drivers are in 
ftp://ftp.yggdrasil.com/private/ethernet/.
