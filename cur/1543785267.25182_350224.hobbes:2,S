In the Intel Architecture Optimization document it specifically states 
(Chapter 2.6) :
"Avoid instructions that unnecessarily introduce dependence-related
stalls: inc and dec instructions, .....".
And again on page 2-11 :
"The inc and dec instructions should always be avoided. Using add and
sub instructions instead avoids data dependence and improves performance".
And on page 2-71 :
"The inc and dec instructions modify only a subset of flags in the flag 
register.
This creates a dependence on all previous writes of the flag register.
This is especially problematic when these instructions are on the critical
path because they are used to change an address for a load on which
many other instructions depend. "
However, the kernel include and arch have a liberal sprinkling of inc/dec,
and AFAICT some of these in hot-path.
