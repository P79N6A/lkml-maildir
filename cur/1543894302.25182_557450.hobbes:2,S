hm, mplayer is not running alone when it does video playback: Xorg is 
also pretty active. Furthermore, the task you are using to monitor 
mplayer counts too. The Core2Duo has a shared L2 cache between cores, so 
it is pretty cheap to move tasks between the cores.

hm, which ones are improved? Could this be due to some other property of 
CFS? If your app relies on /proc/stat then there's no extra precision in 
those cpustat values yet.
i've Cc:-ed Balbir Singh and Dmitry Adamushko who are the main authors 
of the current precise accounting code in CFS. Maybe i missed some 
detail :-)
