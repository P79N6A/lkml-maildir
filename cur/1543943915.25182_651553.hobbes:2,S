I already checked, it's never called AFAICS. And I couldn't find a place
where it should be installed, otherwise, I would have sent a patch. The
dock driver already calls the notify methods on devices in the dock
station before doing the real undock.

immediate_undock=1:
 User presses undock button on the dock station, dock driver calls ACPI
 undock method immediately.
immediate_undock=0:
 User presses undock button on the dock station, dock driver throws uevent
 and waits for userland to undock the system via sysfs.
immediate_undock is currently set to 1 by default.
