ini9100u.* and i91uscsi.* is all of it.

I haven't had any problems so far. Is it an ultra scsi controller, or fast
scsi? The fast scsi controller isn't supported by this driver. I've got
a driver for the INI-9100 here, but haven't ported it to 2.2.x yet.
If you want, I can spend some time in porting it, but I'd need you to test
it, since I haven't got that particular controller.
If the suggestion in a previous post doesn't help (the 'noapic' thingy),
and it's a Initio 9100U(W) card, please let me know, and I'll see if I can
find where the driver is going wrong.
