I think the work done by the U. Wisconsin group for IRON ext3 is the
way to go (namely checksumming of filesystem metadata, and possibly
some level of redundancy).  This gives us concrete checks on what metadata
is valid and the filesystem can avoid any (or further) corruption when
the hardware goes bad.  The existing ext3 code already has these checks,
but as filesystems get larger the validity of a block number of an inode
is harder to check because any value may be correct.  Given that CPU
speed is growing orders of magnitude faster than disk IO the overhead of
checksumming is a reasonable thing to do these days (optionally, of course).
Cheers, Andreas
