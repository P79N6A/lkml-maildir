"expensive syscalls" are a mistake of non-linux unixes :)

it's no more syscalls than are already required to set up stdin, out, and
error... the open() calls replace dup2() calls.
if the path walking is a problem then create a openparent(int parent_fd)
syscall... which would have to do all the same permissions checking that
using an open("/proc/ppid/...") would.
note that for this to be generically useful for CGI you also need to be
able to setuid(), and chdir().  this is why NT CreateProcess has a zillion
arguments -- and why it's really suspect...
