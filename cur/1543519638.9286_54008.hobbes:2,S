Hello,
since somewhere in the 2.2.14pre serie, I see occasionally this message.
It occurs when I am using gnome, e, xemacs, xdvi, some xterms, and
netscape, which I suspect to eat way too much memory.
VM may kill a daemon, which may go unnoticed; a compilation or even the X
session, which is quite annoying.
Would it be possible to add an entry in /proc/sys/vm, where we could write
the PID of the process we prefer to die in case of memory shortage ?
Placing there THE memory hog would solve cleanly the problem ;-)
Greetings
