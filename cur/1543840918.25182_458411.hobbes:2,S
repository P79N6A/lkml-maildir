Just why is it, that when there is a change to make locally defined 
booleans into a more generic one, it is converted into integers? ;)
But seriously, what is gained by removing them, other then less 
understandable code? (Not talking about FALSE -> 0, but boolean_t -> int)
I can understand if authors disprove making an integer into a boolean, 
but here it already were booleans.
But hey, you are the maintainer ;)
