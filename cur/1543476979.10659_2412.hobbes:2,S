Subject: clock ticking slow after CONFIG_SMP

In the 2.2 kernel CONFIG_SMP was set by default and I failed to change 
it.  I have reinstalled 2.2 without SMP but my clock seems to be
messed up.  Running 2.0.36 doesn't help either.  Is this because of
something that happened with SMP?  How do I get the clock working?
Here is the output from adjtimex --adjust:

adjtimex: Invalid argument
my system clock is ticking about 5 times slower than the hardware clock.
