does this still happen with 2.3.44? David noticed a bug in
__flush_tlb_global. Does this happen if you boot it with CONFIG_M386 -
there might be a bug somewhere around individual x86 features we detect.
(although in all cases we should panic visibly if a CPU does not have a
feature a kernel relies on.)

(this is fixed in 2.3.44 - it's a workaround for a bug none of my SMP
systems have.)
