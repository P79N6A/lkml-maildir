Nobody is answering for almost hour, so I'll do...
It was surprise to me that after patching about 100 lines in my
kernel I can live without modules ;-) I cannot redistribute it because
of vmmon/vmnet are linked directly to kernel, but it works. Maybe
I should be constructive, and update module-init-tools to fit my
needs (-p, -s; error messages from insmod going to screen and
not to the dmesg by default..., post-install/pre-install/post-remove/pre-remove
support in modprobe), but after comparing size of modutils and
module-init-tools I'll just leave this job to others: it looks like 
fulltime job for couple of months.

... now when we have setxattr() in kernel, what about using
setxattr() on module directory instead of separate control file? 
I know, you cannot manage it with "echo" then, but it looks
strange that mkdir automatically creates control file while
rmdir does not remove it automatically... and without control
file, sys_delete_module() could then use simple setxattr/vfs_unlink/vfs_rmdir
instead of doing vfs's job by hand.

You are skipping security_ops hooks. Can you use vfs_mkdir() instead
of modfs_mkdir(), just to make sure that if someone adds some new
features into vfs_mkdir(), you'll not miss them ?

One pair of these lines is redundant...
And one minor comment: do you really need both module_dir->module
and module_data->module? Do you use it only to make sure that
sys_delete_module will not operate on modules not created by
sys_init_module? 
It has unfortunate feature that sys_create_module(); 
sys_delete_module() (without suceeding sys_init_module between
them) will return -ENOENT, and you'll have to use rm/rmdir to get 
rid of module :-(
