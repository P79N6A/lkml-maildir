The answer could be to the raw mode emulation of the current 
aux and kbd modules. The best thing would be to let the raw 
codes just bleed through the layers, together with the 
translated ones, and then letting the input event choose which 
one to pass on to the application depending on whether the 
application requested raw access or not. I don't know if this 
would work with AUX, but it would be the best solution for the 
keyboard driver.
In the specific case of the keyboard module, the biggest 
problem (I don't know if it's a bug or WAD) is that some raw 
scancodes don't get emulated correctly *unless* very specific 
keycodes are assigned to it. I have seen this happen with the 
multimedia keys on my keyboard, which do not have any keycode 
assigned by default. Basically what happens is that a key with 
scancode xx, assigned a keycode of yy might return a scancode 
of zz != xx. See for example Chris Osicki's post.
What happens is basically that the 'raw emulation' table is 
*not* updated by changes in the keycode assignments. I don't 
know if this is a bug in setkeycodes, a bug in the kernel 
modules, or some kind of misinteraction between the two.
Considering that in case of multiple keyboards one *should* 
have multiple raw emulation tables (one for each keyboard), I 
really think that it would be more troubles than anything to 
keep and maintain this 'raw emulation' method, which is why I 
suggest a 'bleed through' of raw codes, to be passed on when 
application request them.
At least in theory this shouldn't be much of a problem: just 
adding a parameter to the interface between the input events 
modules and the lower level modules.

WRT this, would it be possible to create a GPM driver for the 
event interface? This way, once kernel support for all the GPM-
supported mice is complete, we would have the three-layered:
kernel | gpm | app
stream, which IIRC should work even with X, since X can read 
the gpm socket ...
BTW, what degree of support do we have for non-Synaptics 
touchpads, in particular ALPS?
