   I got these errors when accessing SATA disk (via scsi):

   when the disk was mounted I got it only when accessing certain 
directories but now any disk access generates these errors and processes 
that touch the disk are in disk wait state (I tried fsck, mount, 
dd_rescue), looks like some of them get out if it after very long time 
(1h+).
   I have another SATA drive (pretty much same, both are Maxtor 
DiamondMax 9, 250GB) and that one works when I connect it to same SATA 
and power cables so I think there is a problem with disk (not my setup 
or cables etc.).
   Since I didn't see any read error before I think it might be the 
electronics being dead, not the disk itself - considering that I have 
another disk of same model is it possible to swap the disks (right now I 
can't try it because I don't have funny screwdriver to fit the screws on 
the disk).
   my system: kernel 2.6.9, debian unstable, SATA disks seen as scsi 
disks (CONFIG_SCSI_SATA=y).
   Is there anything I can do to rescue (some of) the data on the disk?
   TIA,
	erik
