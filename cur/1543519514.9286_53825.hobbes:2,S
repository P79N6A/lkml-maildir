Subject: Oops in 2.2.14pre12

Hello,
I've received some OOPSen in 2.2.14pre12 while I was working with it
remotely (running X clients on linux laptop, X server on PC). High network
load might be the culprit.
I'm using pcmcia drivers version 3.0.13; these seemed to work fine always. I
never had crashes in similar situations with 2.2.13.
The problem might have been fixed already in a newer 2.2.14pre, or it might
disappear with a newer version of the pcmcia package; I don't know what the
preferred version of pcmcia is for use with recent 2.2 kernels?
I'm afraid that the OOPS as I caught it is rather useless. I had to copy it
by hand and ksymoops couldn't locate any of the symbols that were in
modules. The second oops was mostly off the screen and therefore I didn't
try anything with it.
The only kernel configuration-change that I made recently, was to turn on
CONFIG_MODVERSIONS.
compiler version: egcs 1.1.2; binutils: 2.9.5.0.22
Kernel compiled for -march=i586 (instead of the standard -m486) and with -O6
(instead of -O2); however, this has never given me problems, so I'm not too
suspicious of that...
BTW, what is the way to decompress a vmlinuz file into a vmlinux file? This
might help ksymoops to find more info.
Included below are the output of ksymoops, as far as it makes any sense; my
.config file and the output of dmesg.  What else would be useful to include?
Regards,
--Tim
