X already has codes for many of the hotkeys defined in. They have 
names like XF86AudioMute etc. The inet rules define the proper 
scancode -> keycode assignment for X for many keyboards modules.
Yes, I think it would be an interesting idea to have some kind of 
standardization of this for the Linux kernel as well, but before 
thinking about this (or at the same time) it would be nice if we 
could fix the bug in the atkbd driver that makes some of the hotkeys 
that use extended keycodes inaccessible or "shifty".
