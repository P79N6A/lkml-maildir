Debian unstable; since it has no kexec-tools, I built those from source.

/etc/init.d/reboot:
===================
echo -n "Rebooting... "
#reboot -d -f -i
/usr/local/sbin/kexec -f --exec --debug
Loading the Kernel in /etc/init.d/umountfs, before umount'ing /boot:
====================================================================
echo -n "Loading kernel for kexec()..."
/usr/local/sbin/kexec --load /vmlinuz
echo "done."

Nope, no booting. I get one line of output which I don't remember;
I'll have to retry.
> - Would be nice if I can get serial console output.
Sorry, no serial port here.
