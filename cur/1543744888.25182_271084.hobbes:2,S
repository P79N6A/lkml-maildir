Subject: 2.4.27 suddenly hangs

Hello, all!
I‘m not sure that the below problem is kernel related, however, I think, 
this mailing list is the best place to start. I've got 2x1.8 Xeon on 
Intel SE7500CW2 motherboard with Intel SCSI RAID (GDT driver). The 
system powered by Red Hat Linux 7.3 with custom kernel version 2.4.27.
Occasionally, the system just hangs, without giving any error messages 
to syslog or any panic-like messages to the screen. No response to ping. 
Usually it happens on weekends in early hours, but not at particular 
time and day, when users’ activity is minimal. Couple of times the last 
few messages before, the hang had strange timestamps. It seems like the 
system time entered a TIME LOOP within a period of 1 second.
Nov 6 05:37:31 service dhcpd: Message...
Nov 6 05:37:32 service named: Message...
Nov 6 05:37:31 service named: Message...
Almost all the time last messages came from different services, except 
three times, when mgetty was the last. I'd updated mgetty, pppd, kernel 
(from 2.4.20), BIOS, dhcpd etc., however, the problem remains.
Can anyone tell me, how I can detect, what application or hardware cause 
such a problem.
Any ideas would be appreciated.
Thank you in advance
