That is a lame argument.
We've just seen that very competent people can make really silly
mistakes because of generic code without type safety.
*IF* the code had type safety, such silly mistakes would be caught at
compile time.
Now there are arguments for and against implementations such as the type
safe list implementation.  But an argument against type-safety is
rediculous.  If the language does not allow for type safety in any
convenient manner, so be it, but type-safety really is useful for
avoiding silly mistakes, and this should be exploited whenever the
language (and clever *use* of the language) allows for it.

No, C has types.  It is not just portable assembly.
Why do you think it allows for typed pointers and not just void* or
even long?

Wrong.  Look at Atheos for an example.  There is *nothing* you can do in
C that you cannot do in C++ with equal or better performance (there is C
code that is not valid C++, but it's small semantic details and scope
rules, re-writing is simple).
But this is of course irrelevant, as there are other good reasons for
not rewriting the kernel in any other language.

Who is talking about OO ???
What Joshua presented is a C implementation of a list using
parameterized types using macros (instead of templates as could have
been used in C++).  Parameterized types has nothing what so ever in any
way to do with OO  (it goes well with some OO concepts, but that's an
entirely different story).

Yes. And I think that was a very clever decision - even if there had
been proper C++ compilers at the time (which there wan't, because the
language wasn't even standardized until 1998).
But did Linus decide to use "crappy C" or "error-prone C", or is there
some chance that the most generic code could perhaps be implemented in
"robust C" ?
Macros are not a pretty solution, but it is as I see it the only way to
achieve type safety in generic code.  If someone else out there has
other suggestions, please let me know - I actually like to be proven
wrong (because that means I learn something new).
I'd take macro-hell in generic code over void* hell in every single
list-using part of the kernel any day.
