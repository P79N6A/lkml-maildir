Oh sure, will do. I'm not about to submit anything yet anyway, and it
will go through a cleanup phase. The above is just residual of quilt
picking up a file where I added something, then removed it.

The above isn't whitespace damage, it's aligning of the 3 variable

this, but it's definitely intentional.

I think you are beeing anal here, but I'll think about it ;)

Will do.
