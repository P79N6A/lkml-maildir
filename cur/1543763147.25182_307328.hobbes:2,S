this method can be applied, as you've written, only for shell (which 
have to be hacked before). so, every program that runs any other program 
should be hacked to use pre-execution-renice-database. rewriting all the 
programs in the world takes a bit more time than i have to the death. 
woudn't it be simplier to implement it in kernel, somewhere near 
setuid/setgid bits? if it would make system slower, support of such 
attribute could be optional, just like acl-s.
i've found a way to perform such function in userland, but it is awful, 
and, if some program runs another, that should be reniced, very often, 
starting a shell (even ash) for each call will surely smoke my cpu.
this feature without doubt belongs to kernel - it is performed every 
time kernel starts a program, and it is not so complicated like, let's 
say, hotplug support, is it?
thx for replies
