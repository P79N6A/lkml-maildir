Compiling on power5 I get
drivers/built-in.o(.text+0xd448): In function `.rpaphp_config_pci_adapter':
: undefined reference to `.of_scan_bus'
drivers/built-in.o(.text+0xe704): In function `.dlpar_add_slot':
: undefined reference to `.of_create_pci_dev'
drivers/built-in.o(.text+0xe90c): In function `.dlpar_add_slot':
: undefined reference to `.of_scan_pci_bridge'
make: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
Looks like drivers/pci/hotplug/rpadlpar_core.c calls of_create_pci_dev and
of_scan_pci_bridge, and drivers/pci/hotplug/rpaphp_pci.c calls of_scan_bus,
each of which are statically defined in arch/ppc64/kernel/pci.c.
Odd that these are introduced in this patch...  Do they rely on another
patch which was not included in 2.6.14-mm1?
thanks,
