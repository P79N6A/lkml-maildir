Howabout instead of more pointless armwaving and "What about we make
it a compiler option?" messages, someone who thinks the compatability
stuff is a problem posts some _data_.  Do some real benchmarks and
show that on a real network with real latencies you get a real
speedup.  Anything else is a waste of bits.
You could even find that adding #ifdefs around the compatability cruft
(and there's not really that much) will confuse the optimiser enough
that you'll actually lose overall.
Don't speculate.  Benchmark.

P.S.  The last line goes equally for all those who imagine we have a CPU 
affinity problem on SMP without doing any tests.
