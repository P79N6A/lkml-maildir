Hi,
This is an updated RedHat kernel for rh72, with
Intel(R) PRO/100 Network Driver - version 2.2.21-k1
Copyright (c) 2003 Intel Corporation
 What I see from dmesg:
PCI: Found IRQ 11 for device 01:03.0
e100: selftest OK.
divert: allocating divert_blk for eth0
e100: eth0: Intel(R) PRO/100 Network Connection
  Hardware receive checksums enabled
  cpu cycle saver enabled
PCI: Found IRQ 11 for device 01:04.0
e100: selftest OK.
divert: allocating divert_blk for eth1
e100: eth1: Intel(R) PRO/100 Network Connection
  Hardware receive checksums enabled
  cpu cycle saver enabled
e100: eth0 NIC Link is Up 100 Mbps Full duplex
hw tcp v4 csum failed
(repeated many times):hw tcp v4 csum failed
I just don't like it. Is it a known problem with e100?
