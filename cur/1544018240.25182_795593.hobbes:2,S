No it cannot because in SLUB objects must come from the same page.
Multiple objects in a queue will only ever require a single page and not
multiple like in SLAB.

You are not responding to the issue. If you have queues that contain
objects from multiple pages then every object pointer in these queues can
pin a page although this actually is a free object.

This gets better and better.

Groan. Please have a look at do_tune_cpucache() in slab.c
