Have you read the whole thread?
I'd like to have st_flags added to struct stat64, so adding the actual
feature in Linux 2.5 (if it has a chance to get in - that's why I'm
interested in a comment by Linus on this) will not need a new version
of struct stat (and a new  libc to use it), after just having introduced
a new one in Linux 2.4.
Adding some pad to have room for a few features (that will come ...)
makes sense IMHO.
I think planning a little bit in the future is not stupid.
