Subject: HDA DMA Timeout issue

Hello,
in my notebook I sometimes see:
hda: dma_timer_expiry: dma status == 0x20
hda: DMA timeout retry
hda: timeout waiting for DMA
hda: status timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }
hda: drive not ready for command
ide0: reset: success
It happened when I do scp from network or tar xjf kerneltree
It seems that notebook is just not fast enough to not fulfill DMA request.
Is something I could do?
