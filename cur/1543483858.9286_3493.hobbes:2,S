Hi Thomas,
The xconfig ATI Mac64bug is fixed in 2.2.1-ac3.  Try it out and
please send me e-mail if it works.
There are a lot of other xconfig bug fixes in 2.2.2-1, including a
fix for the "I've got CONFIG_PEANUT_BUTTER in my MenuChocolate" bug.
If anyone else on linux-kernel has reported any xconfig bugs in
the past four, please re-send them directly to me.  I got hit by the
"no digests to .net subscribers" bag, er, bug.  :)
Michael
