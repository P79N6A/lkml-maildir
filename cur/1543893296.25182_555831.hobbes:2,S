It would be very helpful to have a clear merge path for dmaengine
changes and the async offload api.  Neil has been extremely helpful
reviewing the raid specific changes, and I received his "Acked-by" for
the changes to MD[1].  However I have thus far been unable to attract
someone to 'ack/nak' the async_tx api and the changes to drivers/dma/
[2].  Jeff commented on an early revision...
I have recently gravitated to Herbert and the crypto directory since
async_tx and crypto have some structural similarities [3].

Sorry, the crypto/Kconfig bustage was a goof on my part as I moved the
async_tx files from drivers/dma/, to the top-level directory, and
finally to crypto/.  Hopefully these recent build breakages I have
caused in -mm have not put the series in too negative a light...
I was hoping the git-ioat.patch situation would be solved by me
rebasing my series on a version of mainline with Chris' changes
merged, but his attempts over the past two merge windows were ignored.
 Should my series wait outside of -mm until git-ioat.patch makes
forward progress?
Overall, I feel that async_tx is perhaps justifiably receiving the
silent treatment because offload engines are not a mainstream
occurrence.  Currently only people with an Xscale IOP or a PPC 440spe
[4] will notice that mainline lacks support for all the features of
their platform.  I see async_tx as a nod to the embedded space where
offload engines act to make up for the absence of multi-Ghz CPUs with
streaming SIMD instructions.
Herbert's offer is greatly appreciated as it will give guidance to the
parts of the series outside of Neil's purview.

Dan
[1]: The ack from Neil was in an offlist message for the MD specific
portion of the series
[2]: I asked DaveM and netdev to take a look at the two patches in the
series that change drivers/dma/ and net/core/dev.c since that was the
original merge path for I/OAT and dmaengine
[3]: async_tx is similar to crypto in that they both provide a library
of memory transforms that can in some cases be carried out by
hardware.
[4]: async_tx has attracted at least one other developer that I know
about to write a driver for their engines:
