Hell no. I was simply commenting that there is some general qualitative
information available from those numbers, even if it is hard to quantify
them. Not working as well for a benchmark may indicate much better typical
performance, and as I understand dbench the io scheduler may improve that
significantly as well.
No, clearly there are other, probably a lot more representative numbers,
which show 2.5 is better. "Isn't working as well" for one thing doesn't
mean "in general," but might be of interest to the primary developers.
The fact that the curve doesn't end in a reload from backup tells me that
the IDE code is much better that it was ;-)
What time I have for diddling kernel code is spent on making network code
changes, and is all against 2.4 base.
