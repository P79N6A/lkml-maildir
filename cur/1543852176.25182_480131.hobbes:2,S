You mean if I wasn't bothered about -not- having the legacy semantics?
Let me put this another way - could you drop the
CONFIG_CPUSETS_LEGACY_API option, and make whatever is needed to
preserve the current cpuset API always present (if CPUSETS themselves
are configured, of course)?
If you're reluctant to do so, why?
