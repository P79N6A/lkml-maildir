Hi
I have seen this problem before, but there was no answer for it. So I
write to this list, too.
On my system, the linux-kernel v2.2.2 won't compile.
I tried to unpack the sources, patch to the current version and use "make
oldconfig" to get a clean .config file, but it fails with the error
"dereferencing pointer to incomplete type" in
/usr/src/linux/drivers/net/loopback.c
I also tried a "make -ki" after that. The problem seems to be in file
"/usr/src/linux/include/net/sock.h", which gets included.
I have put my .config file together with a script what I typed at the URL
http://www.stud.uni-hannover.de/~ingo/pub/10704d72cc6b3831d06bf3d43a9c4385/
- I don't want to post them here;^)
If you have any further questions, please email me, but don't expect an
answer before monday.
    Ingo
