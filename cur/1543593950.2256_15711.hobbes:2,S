It's overkill.  This adds many hundreds of scheduling points
to the kernel, of which we need only five.  It makes more
sense to simply open-code those five.
- generic_file_read/write
- read /dev/zero, /dev/mem
- memcpy_to_iovec()
This will by no means provide a low-latency kernel, but it will
fix the most common causes of poor interactivity in normal
use.
Just doing generic_file_read/write would suffice, actually.
