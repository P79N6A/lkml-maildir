Hi,
have you already looked at the irq's from the lspci output? Especially
the
usage from 16 to 19, for graphics-, sound- and network-card looks a bit
wrong.
From your kernel-configuration I can see that you have acpi enabled, the
first I would do is booting with acpi=off as kernel option. If you
really need acpi later on, you should try with pci=noacpi or pci=biosirq. Also
consider to use a more recent acpi from acpi.sf.net.
If this doesn't help, I would suggest that you also send some lines from
dmesg-output, so that the real experts can see whats going on with your
irq-routing.
Best regards,
        Bernd
