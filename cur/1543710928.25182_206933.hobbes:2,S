ChangeSet@1.1608.54.5, 2004-03-03 00:31:24-05:00, dtor_core@ameritech.net
  Psmouse: some hardware does not ACK "disable streaming mode" command.
           Since we already have an idea that it's a mouse device that
           is present (from its response to GET ID command), instead of
           aborting, issue a warning and continue.
