It also provides them as VESA modes yes. On further inspection, 0x14 is 
actually a bit different:
BIOS 0x14 =              132x25, 8x16 char cell on 1056x400
BIOS 0x54 = VESA 0x10A = 132x43, 8x8  char cell on 1056x350
BIOS 0x55 = VESA 0x109 = 132x25, 8x14 char cell on 1056x350
Booting 2.6.20.1 on the machine with vga=ask finds BIOS 0x14 as 0214 and 
VESA 0x10A as 030A but allows me to select 0254, 0255 and 0309 as well.
('scan' finds BIOS 0x14 as 0114 and BIOS 0x54 as 0154)
Rene.
