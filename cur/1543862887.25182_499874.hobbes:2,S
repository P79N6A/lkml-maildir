i preferred to introduce this as a non-intrusive change, which didn't
*require* any change to actual source code or header files.  note that
you can add these two new categories (and any other categories you
can dream up) without changing *anything* else about the build
process.  and once those two categories are in the init/Kconfig file,
subsystem maintainers can, on their own time, make the appropriate
changes to their subsystems.  it's all perfectly voluntary.
also, code that's deprecated can still be tagged with
"__attribute__((deprecated))" in the source code.
