I had in mind fallback as opposed to a changed base, but a particular
choice of the base may cover enough cases. The bugreport below seems to
say there's no need for a change.

This sounds like nothing is needed, then.

Fishing around down there to utilize it for mmap() placement should
happen anyway if things fall back far enough in the top-down scheme.
Answers like "I've thought about it" or "I've seen this and dealt with
it" are good enough for me. There isn't much of a normative aspect to
user virtualspace layout.
Thanks.
