and if it really cripples the one real user of the API.. then it's
clearly a wrong thing and it should be fixed (by going away and going
direct instead).
As for your argument about the bickering... well... afaics most of the

that LSM exports were _GPL only .. or when their modules were reviewed
and shown to be architecturally broken.
Who's left today?
