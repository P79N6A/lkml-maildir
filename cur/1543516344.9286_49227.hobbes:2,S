Nothing. Kernels from 2.3.27 are not supported yet. The new /proc code is
not able to create devices inside /proc directory :-((
It would be good to include the following patch (or similar) into kernel.
Please, let me know, if someone will do it, because I'm not checking 2.3
kernel changes every day.
