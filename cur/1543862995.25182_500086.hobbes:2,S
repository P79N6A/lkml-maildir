Thank you all for all your input. The tune2fs option was eventually
used and we run into other problems. I think Andries was right in
that the initrd was interfering, that's where we run into issues
after the tune2fs.
I was trying to avoid the tune2fs as it involves booting into
a live CD and brings the system down to where I can't access
it over the network (it is a 4 hour drive).
At the end we had to replace the drive and recreate all file
systems. If it ever happens again I will pay closer attention
to the initrd commands to see if the rootfstype=ext2 was overridden
with what's there.
Thanks,
Alberto
