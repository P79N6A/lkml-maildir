The cpio initrd isn't documented in
linux-2.6.17/Documentation/initrd.txt.
(but it is in
linux-2.6.17/Documentation/filesystems/ramfs-rootfs-initramfs.txt)
initrd.txt shouldn't be updated?
Two possible updates follow, use patch -p1 inside the kernel tree.

 Third, you have to create the RAM disk image. This is done by creating a
 file system on a block device, copying files to it as needed, and then
 copying the content of the block device to the initrd file. With recent
-kernels, at least three types of devices are suitable for that:
+kernels, at least four types of devices are suitable for that:
 
  - a floppy disk (works everywhere but it's painfully slow)
  - a RAM disk (fast, but allocates physical memory)
  - a loopback device (the most elegant solution)
+ - a cpio containing the initrd files, described in
+   Documentation/filesystems/ramfs-rootfs-initramfs.txt
 
 We'll describe the loopback device method:

+It is also possible to use a cpio archive (instead of a file system), 
+and pack all the files inside it.
+The kernel will create a ramdisk, unpack the contents of the initrd

+
+To create such a file:
+
+ 1) Enter the directory containig the unpacked initrd files:
+    # cd /path/to/initrd
+ 2) Create the cpio file (whithout any leading path).

 For experimenting with initrd, you may want to take a rescue floppy and
 only add a symbolic link from /linuxrc to /bin/sh. Alternatively, you
 can try the experimental newlib environment [2] to create a small
