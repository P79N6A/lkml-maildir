Sounds cool, I'll try that.
Thanks.

Hasn't happened yet.

Fair enough, but I've got mdmonitor to send me an email when that happens.

Cool, a cron job should take care of that.

Oh....  Sounds a bit like it's not really as good as you once said it was.

Definitely not, I want to shut down Samba because it's using a
filesystem, which is using a MD device.

Fair enough.
I guess a dependency system would have to be more complicated, then,
taking into account which particular resources a process depends on,
not just which subsystem.

Right.

I'm not sure I buy your argumentation.  But I do acknowledge that
being able to modify init scripts, without having C knowledge is
definitely a plus, seeing as they're obviously often far from perfect.
> Learn to manipulate the initscripts then.
Yeah, I chould sit down and look at how Red Hat did their whole init thing.
OTOH, I don't really have time to dissect 'em and find what problem
they have.  I think I'll just switch distro and see if I have better
luck with something else.

I have a feeling that this is not the problem.
After all, this should be something that every distro has gotten
right, it's not really an issue you have to think long about.
I think the problem occurs in the "sending processes the TERM/KILL
signal" phase.
Perhaps because one phase is initiated too early, before various
services such as Samba has shut down.
Anyway, let's all forget about the init scripts forthwith, they're not
really relevant for LKML I think.
Concentrate on the ext3 issue :-).
