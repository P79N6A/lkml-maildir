n is the total amount to write: to_do is the amount still unwritten. The
rest is buffered but written.

Same here. I'm sort of surprised that it *did* change. The last change
to anything in that function was in 2005, and the fragment shown is
ten years old.
I suspect some other change made it easier to see this pre-existing
behaviour. I wonder if something in glibc used to call __fpurge() for
you?

And since it looks like a kernel bug idiots like me are going to keep on
bugging the l-k list with a non-kernel bug.

Well, the machine's still running after more than six hours, where before
it would freeze solid in half an hour or less.
So I'd say it's fixed :)
