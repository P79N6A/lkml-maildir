But for users this is a recent regression since 2.6.24 worked
and 2.6.25 does not.
If this problem was on x86 Linus himself and some other core developers 
would most likely have debugged this issue and Linus would have delayed 
the release of 2.6.25 for getting it fixed there.
And stuff that "only showed up on one particular machine" often shows up 
on many machines (we only know in hindsight) and the "one particular 
machine" is often due to the fact that of the many machines that might 
trigger a regression only one was used for testing this -rc kernel.
This not in any way meant against you personally, and due to the fact 
that the powerpc port is among the better maintained parts of the kernel 
this regression eventually got fixed, but in many other parts of the 
kernel this would have been one more of the many regressions that were 
reported and never fixed.
