We have discussed this a number of times.  There are several issues with
it; one being that per-cpu != per-thread (we can switch CPU whereever
we're preempted), and another that many versions of gcc uses hardcoded
registers, in particular %fs on 64 bits, but the kernel *has* to use %gs
since there is no swapfs instruction.
