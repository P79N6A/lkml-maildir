	Great, thanks.
>(oh, care to add a "Signed-off-by:" line to your patches?)
	When we first started using Signed-off-by: lines, I did,
and then somebody commented on it to me in some way that gave me

patches, but I'm happy to resume adding Signed-off-by: lines to all
of my patches that are proposed for integration in the future.
