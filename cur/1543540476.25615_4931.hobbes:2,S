For what its worth:
In the 2.4.0-test2 tree the function  plusb_bh() in
../drivers/usb/plusb.c calls schedule() and appears to be called as a
bottom half from the "tq_secheduler".  As I understand it this will
cause the indicated symptoms.  The source does not say, and I have no
idea what plusb.c is used for, but it is in the usb directory.
