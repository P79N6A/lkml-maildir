That's really wierd.  Can you make the code in question be:
~            } else if (nblock > 0) {
~                printk("Number of blocks left: %d\n", nblock);
~                end_request(1);
~            } else {
and then send the results when it happens?
It turns out my machine does not have an ISA bus slot, so I can't plug 
my drive in anywhere.
Thanks,
