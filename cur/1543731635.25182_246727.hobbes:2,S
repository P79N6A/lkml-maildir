no, it'll stop distributions from shipping kernels with both drivers
built-in, modular kernels will work fine, X picks the driver to load, if
people are building in the drivers then I believe they know what they are
at...
Having both drivers built-in is obviously broken and actually doesn't work
at all (someone reported it in an Xorg bug...)
