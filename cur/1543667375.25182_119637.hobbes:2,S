Okay, this indeed works for me too.
Interesting is this:
MPS 1.4 disabled in BIOS (no irq rerouting table in memory), acpi enabled in 
kernel, apic on: 3Com module tries to claim IRQ 0, which is of course 
incorrect.
the IRQ rerouting causes trouble for my SCSI card too, I guess we're still a 
long way from usable ACPI and APIC :( If I can be of any help to test things, 
please let me know.
