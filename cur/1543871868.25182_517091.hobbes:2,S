How about SysRq-r?

Maybe that means the process is dying but isn't completely dead yet, and 
it's stuck running something inside the reiser4 driver.  Unless we can 
find out what it is, though, there isn't much we can do.

Most of those (maybe all of them) are built-in kernel threads.

Something is badly messed up somewhere, but I have no idea what it could 
be.
These problems start with some USB resets, right?  Did they occur with 
earlier kernel versions, or is this new behavior?
How often does the problem occur?
