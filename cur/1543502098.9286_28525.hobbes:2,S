The basic purpose of the IRQ line on the video card is to make life hard. A
number of manufacturers realised some time ago that if they made their video
IRQ lines quirky, and only vaguely subject to control, they could make life
even harder. Their basic distain for customers made them gleefully opt for
this. Many strange PC problems go away if you just put the video card on a
separate interrupt, and don't use it. That way the card can generate all the
interrupts it likes, but the interrupt controller on the motherboard just
ignores them. It can make life hard to loose a precious interrupt to a card
that isn't using it, but on balance life becomes much easier. This is just as
true for 95, 98 and NT as for Linux, since its a hardware issue.
An additional pain with Windows is that a number of video drivers don't seem to
function properly unless the video card gets interrupt 9, even though they
don't actively use the video interrupts. I've never investigated the reason,
but I know that reselecting the interrupt for the video card slot to make it 9
can make a lot of Windows hangups go away.
