Andrew,
This set of patches should address most of perfctr's
coding issues that you've noted recently.
I'll start writing documentation on the low-level
drivers today.
The parts that follow are:
1/6: fix CONFIG_PERFCTR_INIT_TESTS && !CONFIG_X86_LOCAL_APIC
     linkage error
2/6: Kconfig-related updates
3/6: add __user annotations
4/6: PPC32 cleanups
5/6: reduce stack usage
6/6: misc minor cleanups
