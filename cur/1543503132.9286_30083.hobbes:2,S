SYN+FIN+data frames look ok in 793 to me.  Receiver has the option to
ignore the data or not -- depends on receiver's initial window.  And
1379 gives an example SYN+FIN transaction which it says is standard 793.
Or do you mean T/TCP as a whole is a violation of 793?  I think this is
not so if done properly as a 793 implementation will ignore the T/TCP
options and the T/TCP implementation should then use the standard 793
timeouts & state machine.

Agreed :)  The T/TCP options mechanism doesn't look as well thought out,
as clear or as well tested as the TCP options we do use (from reading
the RFCs).  I'm not surprised it's still considered experimental.
