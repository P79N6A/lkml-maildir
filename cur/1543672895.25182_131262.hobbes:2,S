SMP PIII 1.4 GHz, dual Adaptec AIC-7899P U160/m (rev 01)

I cannot say which version of the driver it was, the only thing I can tell you
is that the archive was called aic79xx-linux-2.4-20030410-tar.gz.

I can't tell, basic problem in my setup is that it seems virtually impossible
to bring some 100GB of data onto a streamer connected to the above aic. It
crashes almost every day with a freeze and no oops or other message. I am at
the moment willing to await 2.4.21 and see, and if that does not solve it, then
I will probably go back to a dual symbios controller which I used before and
never had any glitches with.
This is a system in production and not particularly useful for debugging a lot
and correspoding downtime.

Stephan
