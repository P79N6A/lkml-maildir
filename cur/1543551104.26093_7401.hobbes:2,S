Not needed.  This is a misunderstanding.  Maybe that needs
some work (in Help maybe), but not this patch.
You have the first USB option ("Support for USB") set to Y,
right?
Then if you select USB HID support, that builds the hid driver,
which handles mice, keyboards, joysticks, gamepads, speaker
buttons, any-old-kind-of buttons, toaster buttons, etc.
OTOH, if you want just some basic USB mouse & keyboard support,
you don't have to use the hid driver, you can use the HIDBP
(HID Boot Protocol) drivers instead.  However, these drivers
(hid and hidbp) are mutually exclusive and you shouldn't
try to select both of them.
