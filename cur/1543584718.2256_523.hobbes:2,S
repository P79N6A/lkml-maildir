Probably the rate at which is called sys_sched_yield() is not so high to let
the performance improvement to be measurable.
If You're going to measure the schedule() speed with the test program in which
the schedule() rate is the same of the sched_yield() rate, this could clean Your
measure of the schedule() speed.
