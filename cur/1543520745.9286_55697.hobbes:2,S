No/yes
1. No: Given the following:
    X server --->NAT---->remote host -- X app
   Then a straight X application running on the remote host cannot establish
   a session with the X server. That would require some type of relay on the
   NAT host - which then depends on the relay to be able to establish
   links from (potentially) multiple servers(hosts) behind the NAT to multiple
   remote hosts. Not likely or desirable.
2. yes: Given the following:
    X server -- ssh client ---->NAT--->remote host -- sshd server -- X app
    and that the sshd server permits X forwarding.
    Secure shell can/does establish a TCP link to a remote sshd server.
    If the sshd server is configured to allow X forwarding, then the
    sshd server will establish a tunnel from the sshd server back to the
    ssh client, which then passes it to the X server. The sshd server
    creates a pseudo X server, along with X authentication keys, and allows
    the X app to connect to the pseudo X server. This provides an encrypted
    communication path from ssh client  to sshd server for all X traffic.
    In some cases the transfer can be faster since the encryption also does
    a compression on the data passed.
