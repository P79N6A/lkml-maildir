It is instead. Otherwise you would drop the flushtime field and you would
simply tell kupdate to flush all dirty buffers out there.

And when you say "ah, I wrote the wrong vmlinuz file, so just overwrite it
with the right one" and you have to wait the double of time before being
able to extract the floppy. That's ugly IMHO.
