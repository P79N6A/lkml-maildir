I saw one report where the recent drm security hole fix broke dri
for one user.  Whilst it seems an isolated incident, could this have
more impact than we first realised ?
Worse case scenario we can drop out the multi-bridge support for now
if it needs work. Mike left SGI now, so we'll need to find someone else
with access to a Prism to make sure it still works correctly on a
real multi-gart system.
