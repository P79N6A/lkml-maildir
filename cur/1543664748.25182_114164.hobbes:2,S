I find myself thinking, in passing, why we don't have these
architectures define something like the following in architecture
specific code:
	struct dma_addr {
		unsigned long cpu;
		unsigned long bus;
		unsigned long size;
	};
	#define dma_bus_addr(x)	((x).bus)
	#define dma_cpu_addr(x)	((x).cpu)
and have:
	dma_map_single(dev, &dma_addr, addr, size);
	dma_sync_single(dev, &dma_addr);
Architectures which only need the CPU address can place only that in
their structure definition, and make dma_map_single and friends no-ops.
I feel that this would get rid of all the shouting DMA_* macros found
in various pci.h header files.
This may be something considering for 2.7 though.
DaveM, as the author of the original PCI DMA API, any comments on this
(probably ill-thoughtout) idea?
