That looks like it'll work fine with respects to grouping by mobility but 
there is a slight functional difference worth noting. Specifically, the 
old code did not obey cpuset limits because __GFP_HARDWALL was not set. 
This change gets it's GFP mask from bdget() calling mapping_set_gfp_mask() 
which is GFP_USER and so will obey CPUSET limits. This new version looks 
more correct.
