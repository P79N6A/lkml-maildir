noooooooooo.  You're approaching it from the wrong direction.
Step 1 is to understand what is happening on the affected production
system.  Completely.  Once that is fully understood then it is a relatively
simple matter to concoct a test case which triggers the same failure mode.
It is very hard to go the other way: to poke around with various stress
tests which you think are doing something similar to what you think the
application does in the hope that similar symptoms will trigger so you can
then work out what the kernel is doing.  yuk.
