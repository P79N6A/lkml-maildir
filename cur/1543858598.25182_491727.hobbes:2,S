I realize it isn't text you added, but what's that supposed to mean?
Surely the 8-character indents are made up of spaces.  Does it mean
"spaces other than 8-space blocks"? In any case, how does it synch
with the following chapter's statement that continuations " are placed
substantially to the right" - isn't that done with spaces, too?
Or am I just totally spacing out on what was meant?
