All,
I wish to suggest a possible 2.6 or 2.7 feature (too late for 2.4.x and 
2.5.x, I believe) that I believe would be helpful. Currently, printk 
messages are all in english, and I was wondering if printk could be 
modified to print out user messages that are in the default language of 
the machine. For example,
printk(KERN_WARN "This driver is messed up!\n", 'en'); //Prints the 
english text .
printk(KERN_WARN "This driver is messed up!\n", 'wel'); //Prints the 
welsh translation of the english text.
printk(KERN_WARN "This driver is messed up!\n", getdefaultlanguage());
I'm looking for a possible uniform design to make this happen, short of 
adding a complete machine translation module to the kernel. :) Userland 
internationalization support is already provided(I haven't personally 
used other languages besides English, but I've seen the options), but a 
kernel module or printk addition that handles localized kernel messages 
seems reasonable.
Thoughts, comments?
Regards,
Frank
