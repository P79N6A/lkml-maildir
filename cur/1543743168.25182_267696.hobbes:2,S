"page < highmem_start_page" would be equivalent to page->mapped == 1.
I'll try to reproduce the problem, frankly I wondered how
DEBUG_PAGEALLOC could ever work with the current pageattr code that is
far from be usable outside a single device driver that owns the physical
region (then I thought DEBUG_PAGEALLOC perhaps was in an unusable state
like dead code). The current change_page_attr is basically only for
symmetric use via ioremap_nocache or AGP explicit code, that _owns_ the
region by registering in resource.c. Attempting to use the current
restrictive API in random page resources not registared and owned by the
caller, may not even be fixable without creating an universal API.
