Yup, exactly.

I agree, that could apply on top of the monotonic cycles patch. It's
just a different way to see it : dealing with wrapping TSC bits,
returning the LSBs given by the hardware, rather than simply
accumulating time. This is what the patch I sent earlier (which I use in
LTTng) does. I currently expects 32 LSBs to be given by the hardware,
but it would be trivial to extend it to support any given number of
hardware LSBs.
