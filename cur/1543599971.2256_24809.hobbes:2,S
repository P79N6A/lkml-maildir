It might be that the elevator works now... :-)
You will only see it once there are no remaining free pages of an even higher
order left - then you will start to fail...
Two things are required:
1) You have lots of memory.
2) You have used it all at some point.
Another thing to do could be to add a order parameter to free.
The pages allocated has to be freed sometime... if we make sure that
they are freed together it could simplify things - no chance that the
first part gets allocated directly...
Or/and we could remove the sources of higher order allocs, as an example:
why is the SCSI layer allowed to allocate order 3 allocs (32 kB) several
times per second? Will we really get a performance hit by not allowing
higher order allocs in active driver code?
