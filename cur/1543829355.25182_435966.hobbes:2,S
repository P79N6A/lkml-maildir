WTF?  This is a REGRESSION from the repeatedly expressed desire -- clear 
throughout libata -- that single-use PCI device IDs should not ever 
receive PCI_DEVICE_ID_xxx constants.
I'm going to queue up a revert patch for this silliness.
Next time, please let the relevant maintainer(s) know when you are 
touching their driver, so they have a chance to filter out the crap.
This was -never- sent to me or linux-ide, or otherwise brought to the 
attention of the maintainers.
