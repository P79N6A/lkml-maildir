Unfortunately I don't think it's that simple -- drivers would have to
do something like
	if (IRQF_MSI == IRQF_SHARED) {
		// lose MSI optimizations, do an MMIO read, etc.
	} else...
As I said I think that if we're running on a system where MSI
interrupts might be shared, we should just have pci_enable_msi() fail
so drivers fall back to their usual interrupt handler.
