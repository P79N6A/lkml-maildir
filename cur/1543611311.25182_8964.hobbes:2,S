I have a similar problem with /dev/sda9.  Booting 2.4.11...16 results in a 
partition not found error (as reported by fsck).  Going back to 2.4.10ac10, 
fdisk tells me that the partition ID for sda9 is 0x0000 which is corrupt, and 
will be fixed on a write.  I do the write, and sda9 is still invisible.  
Delete and recreate the partition with the exact same cylinder values, and 
the partition comes back, but is unmountable and un-fsck-able.
Examining raw hex data from other partitions, I find that the ext2 label 
string (as set with the -L flag to mke2fs) occurs at offset 02160 (octal) 
into the raw partition.  But on /dev/sda9, it is occurring at 01160 instead - 
off by one 512 byte sector.  Foo.  2.4.16 has not made my day.
