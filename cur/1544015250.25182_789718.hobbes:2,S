Nadia,
it appears as if post-2.6.26 commit
cf481c20c476ad2c0febdace9ce23f5a4db19582 "idr: make idr_remove rcu-safe"
was buggy as it removed a memset(...0...) from idr_remove_all() without
any obvious replacement.  And this patch fixes it.  Is this correct?
This was observed by David in Fedora 2.6.27.* kernels and in 2.6.28, and
I have it seen in vanilla 2.6.28 --- but only after I disabled some
debug kconfig options.  The trigger for the bug is not the existing
usage of idr in drivers/firewire/, but a new usage which is not yet in
mainline.  More details:
http://marc.info/?l=linux1394-devel&m=123140439522563
The symptom is that after a few destructions of idr trees (which involve
idr_remove_all() of course), there appear spurious idr entries in
subsequently newly created idr trees.  These spurious entries then crash
the driver when it iterates over them.
Andrew,
the triggering code are feature additions which I vaguely hoped of still
getting ready for pull before 2.6.29-rc1.  I see as my options now
  - to queue up this lib/idr fix --- if reviewers like it --- together
    with my drivers/firewire updates for a pull request very very soon,
  - to send my firewire updates independently of this idr patch but
    with a simple temporary workaround at the new idr using driver code,
  - to wait with these firewire features for 2.6.30.
It's about these updates:

What do you think?
