I agree with all your arguments up to here. But being able to run Linux
in 4Meg or even 8M is important to a very large class of applications. 
Even if you are concerned mostly about bigger systems, making sure NT
remains at a serious disadvantage in the embedded boxes is key because
MS will certainly hope to use control of SOHO routers, set-top boxes
etc to set "standards" that will improve their competitivity in desktop
and beyond. It would be a delicious irony if MS were able to re-use
against Linux the "first control low end" strategy that allowed them 
vaporize the old line UNIXes, but irony is not as satisfying as winning.
