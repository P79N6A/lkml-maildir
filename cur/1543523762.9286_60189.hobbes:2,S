Init takes a segmentation fault early on (the fault address is just
beyond one of the areas mapped in by init by that stage).  The sig-11 is
delivered correctly to user space, but the user-space signal handler
recursively SEGVs itself.  User-visible symptom: complete system hang as
soon as the VFS is mounted.
