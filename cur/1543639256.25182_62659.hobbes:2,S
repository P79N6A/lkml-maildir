Agreed, it'll work when things are well behaved and the
system isn't overloaded.
However, having been a curious student myself I'm pretty
sure student workloads aren't always well behaved and do
have a tendency to overload the system once in a while.
I'm not sure Linux will be able to deal with the "I wonder
what happens if I ..." type students ;)
