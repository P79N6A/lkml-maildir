Right now there are only two possible values for mode --- it's not
clear what additional values there will be in the future.
How about two syscalls?  If we decide later on we need something more
complicated we can revisit this and *THEN* add another system call
which may end up being a superset of the other two.
I know that sounds somewhat icky but:
  * it's fairly simple
  * we get nice argument handling on all arches by dropping u32 mode
    (don't we?)
  * syscalls don't really cost a lot to keep about, they do cost in
    terms on maintenance though, but in this case i don't see it being
    all that much of a problem
  * IMO badly/over designed syscalls are going to be a bigger problem
    long term
Given that *NO* single fs in mainline right now can *reliably* use
this functionality for a while maybe whatever solution people come up
with next should sit in -mm for a while?  At least that gives people
exposure to it and a chance to make some changes as once it's merged
to mainline it's pretty hard to change.
