The overuse of atomics is horrific in what is being proposed.  All the
major architectures except powerpc (i386, x86-64, ia64, and sparc64) 
implement local_t.  It would make far more sense to push the last few 
stragglers (which mostly seem to be uniprocessor) into writing the 
appropriate implementations.  Perhaps it's time to add a #error in 
asm-generic/local.h?
