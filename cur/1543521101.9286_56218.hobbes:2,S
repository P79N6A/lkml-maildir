Because doing otherwise would break ANSI/ISO C compatibility?
In fact, ISO C0X approval is NOT ENOUGH: because breaking programs written  
perfectly correct according to C9X is not an option right now. In ten  
years, maybe.
Remember that those programs _do_ work right on a platform where time_t is  
64 bit and one standard integer type - say, long - is 64 bits, too. Such  
as most 64 bit platforms. Why break them for a 32 bit platform? There's no  
urgent need.
