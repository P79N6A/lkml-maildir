There is no requirement that the bridge driver be generic code. I
agree that it is simpler but there is nothing stopping a "generic"
driver from just having PCI IDs for all of the existing bridges built
into it and then load it like a normal driver. Loading all of the
bridge PCI IDs into the "generic" driver gets rid of the need for
driver priorities.
