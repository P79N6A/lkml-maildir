Yes, I realize that, but it's the old case of
  "I'm totally faithful to my husband - I never sleep with other men when 
   he is around"
joke.
Basically, if it's wrong to use, it's wrong to use even occasionally. In 
fact, having two different code-paths just makes the code worse.
Yes, I realize that sometimes you have to do it that way, and it might be 
the simplest way to fix something. In this case, though, the cost and 
fragility of a generic interface is not worth it, since the problem isn't 
actually in the generic code at all..
