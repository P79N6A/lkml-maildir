2.5 is older audio code than 2.4.19-ac
If your audio isnt working then a good starting point is to grab the
2.4.19-ac1 i810_audio (you can drop those files into 2.4.19 vanilla
fine)
1.	Does the mixer work, can you play a CD, control the volume etc ?
If so that means we have an active codec and the AC97 bus is running
2.	Do you get regular interrupts doing "yes oink >/dev/audio"
This is a good clue to whether the bus master engine is running. If it
is we should be getting regular interrupts (and if the audio works a
nasty squeak)
3.	Does the audio speed test report about 48Khz (expected except on some
Dell laptops)
