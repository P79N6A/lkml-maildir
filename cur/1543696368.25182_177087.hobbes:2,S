Hello,
2.6.0-test9 is just tremendous ;-)
I have also tried 2.6.0-test9-bk5 and 2.6.0-test9-bk12 and the system
seems much slower than under 2.4 :-(
Also when I change for a screen to the other (I use fvwm2).
I have a P4@2200 with 1Gb DDR, MSI Max2-BLR motherboard, two DVB-s
cards, one SB live, one Adaptec AIC-7892A U160/m, one Adaptec
AHA-2940U/UW/D / AIC-7881U and a Matrox G550.
Any idea why?
	Grégoire
