HP sells compaq nx5000 notebooks with Linux preloaded. Unfortunately
suspend-to-RAM is not there (IIRC). That's because suspend-to-RAM is
hard to do with ACPI.
PCMCIA... well, that's another obsolete technology. Too bad. 
They are people who care about notebooks, there's just no one that
cares about *old* notebooks any more.
