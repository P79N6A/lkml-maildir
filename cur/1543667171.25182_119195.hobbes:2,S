	It does.  That's the point.  monotonic_clock() is intended as a
portable and consistent wrapper around such access.  Otherwise, any
module that needs such access must do system specific work (TSC on x86,
cyclone on x86-x440, other stuff on S/390, etc).  In addition, having
speedstep handling in one place is a good thing.
