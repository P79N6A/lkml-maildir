Yes, I am just trying your new patch, and it works! Furthermore it seems 
to have less ipact on system performance than the tack one, as now 
hdparm reports the same figures as without using APIC. Well done!
Have you read the post  from Mathieu about his finding of APIC and 8254 
timer not being sync, which causes lock-ups? Maybe there should be the 
correct way of fixing it. Furthermore I saw this in latest ACPI update:
[ACPI] nforce2 timer lockup from Maciej W. Rozycki
Is this the fix or something else?
Cheers,
Prakash
