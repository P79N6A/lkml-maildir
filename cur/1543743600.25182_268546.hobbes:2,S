Can you throw your .config this way as well, I've just built 2.6.9
with i810 drm and no i810 framebuffer (CONFIG_DRM_I810 and
!CONFIG_FB_I810) and played tuxracer just fine for a few minutes under
a gnome session on a Fedora core 1 box with a prerelease of Xorg
6.8... (my i810 test machine doesn't get taken out all that often...)
I did just modprobe the i810 framebuffer module I also built and try
to start X and X wouldn't start with a unable to bind system texture
memory,.... so trying building a kernel without i810 framebuffer
switched on a see what happens..
Dave.
