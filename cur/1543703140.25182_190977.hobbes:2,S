I have some more info on this bug:
Apparently, lock/trigger is a named pipe that connects to
qmail-send.  I immediately tried stracing qmail-send while sending
the test message, but unfortunately, the bug is not reproducible
while qmail-send is straced.  The entire process is almost as
fast as it is under 2.4 when I strace qmail-send.
At least now we have a temporary workaround:
  strace -p $(pidof qmail-send) -o /dev/null &
:-)
Btw, the output from strace -p $(pidof qmail-send) can be viewed here:
(probably not interesting though, since the bug is not reproduced
under strace)
