You can pass acpi=ht into the kernel command line to disable
ACPI except the minimum required to get HT support.
From Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt:
acpi=       [HW,ACPI] Advanced Configuration and Power Interface
            ...
            ht -- run only enough ACPI to enable Hyper Threading
