Hi.  I Have a Radeon 9200c and ever since some time in the 2.6.9
series, I cannot get X to start using this card.  It dies in such a
way that there is no way to get the vga console out of that console
and chvt from another terminal just hangs and xinit cannot be
cancelled.
This is the lspci for the agp card.
