I just noticed that I have to add mem=256M to use all
the installed memory.  Note that I never have to do
this before, so there must be something changed along the 
line after 2.2.14pre10 or 2.2.14pre12.
Note also that all 2.3.x kernel up to 2.3.34 can detect
all 256MB of memory as well.  I'm using ABIT BH6 MB with
two 128MB DIMM's.  Anybody else notice this behavior too?
