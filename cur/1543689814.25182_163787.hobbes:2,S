Hi,
Please bear with me and enlighten me a bit. I've been fiddling with
2.5/2.6 for some time, and got most of my hardware working (including
acpi...) better than in 2.4. (in fact now I'm using only 2.6). So now I
got to the point where I'm looking at nice-to-have stuff like sensors.
I know libsensors is not yet 2.6 aware, but I thought sensed values
where available in sysfs if one wanted to manually read them. Since I
have via hardware:
00:00.0 Host bridge: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT8377 [KT400 AGP] Host
Bridge
00:01.0 PCI bridge: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT8235 PCI Bridge

(rev 04)
I build-in via-pro and VIA686A:
CONFIG_I2C_VIAPRO=y
CONFIG_SENSORS_VIA686A=y
Now there is no sensor-related message as far as I can see in my dmesg,
and I do not seem to find any temperature/fan related info in /sys:

So I'd like to know how I'm supposed to check if the kernel sensors part
works (and eventualy get some useful info out of it)
