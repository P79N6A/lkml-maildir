I observed the exact same behavior on a client's network not too long ago 
which used a Cyberguard firewall as a NAT gateway. I didn't have time to 
fully look into it but disabling TCP window scaling in Linux allowed me to 
work without problems.

I saw this with kernels v2.6.16, v2.6.17, and v2.6.18. Windows XP however 
didn't seem to have any problems. So unless Windows doesn't have window 
scaling on by default (or uses a workaround) it could be a broken kernel.
Wish I could be more help...
