Looking back over the thread, you have a failed cable detect.
I do not know why, but pat ide0=ata66 and ide1=ata66 to see if that is a
temp work-around.
You said nothing selected?
Does that mean your bios is set to [none] for all devices?
If so change it to [auto], [none] tends to do strange things.
