Hi,
I'm seeing these gcc warnings in test10-pre[23].
They could have occurred before that also -- I don't know.
I'm using gcc 2.7.2.3.  Is that a problem?
Also, I can't boot test10-pre[23].  I get an oops in swapper.
It's not logged so I can't see where it's actually happening.
I'll try to hook up a serial connection so I can get the info.
Would any of the problems below keep me from being able
to boot?
