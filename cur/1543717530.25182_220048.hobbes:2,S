There is some kind of implicit prohibition in Documentation/CodingStyle
(Chapter3: Placing braces):
"Heretic people all over the world have claimed that this inconsistency
is ...  well ...  inconsistent, but all right-thinking people know that
(a) K&R are _right_ and (b) K&R are right.  Besides, functions are
special anyway (you can't nest them in C)."
               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Maybe the way it is stated is too close so subliminal ;-) But I never found 
a real need for them in C.
