Yes. The cryptoloop compatible format will stay this way. The format
(basically the cipher used and the iv generation mode) can be specified.
I posted a small description some time ago:

The -cbc was renamed to -plain in order to make more iv generation
methods possible which of course also use the CBC mode.
