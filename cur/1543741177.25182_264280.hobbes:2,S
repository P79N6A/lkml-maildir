This has been changed so that LMA (Load memory address) reflects the
physical address where sections shall be loaded. This is required to
make sure that a kexec boot can load a vmlinux image.

This looks like a problem with the older binutils package. I had faced
similar problem on one of the machines but it was resolved as soon as I
switched to a newer binutils package.

Switching to latest binutils package should help.

To reflect the physical address where .text section shall be loaded. As
mentioned earlier, vmlinux booting using kexec requires this.
