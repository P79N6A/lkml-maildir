I have tried to track all regressions, but it is a lot of work, so I
center on development kernels.
There are two lists (both unmaintained)
http://kernelnewbies.org/known_regressions_2622
http://kernelnewbies.org/known_regressions_2621
If you compare them, you will see "New regressions (submitted after
2.6.21 a.k.a. for -stable team)" - a long list of problems reported
after 2.6.21 release. I really do not have time to track issues in
stable releases.

Michal
