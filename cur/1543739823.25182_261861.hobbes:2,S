Booted to single user and was able to get some network operations going
with
this version (w/ previously mentioned update). However, at the step where
I start CUPS, I got a number of traces on the display referring to
parport_pc
related function calls [but I don't use a parallel printer...]. It ended
with:
NMI Watchdog detected LOCKUP on CPU1, eip c0139b22, registers:
[not sure you want the all the details, I'll put a few key items in
and can try to reproduce on request]
Modules linked in: parport_pc lp parport autofs4 sunrpc 8139too mii dm_mod
uhci_hcd ext3 jbd
CPU:    1
... EIP is at sub_preempt_count+0x82/0xa0
... Process ksoftirqd/1 (pid:5 ...)
Pid: 1825, comm:    modprobe
... CPU: 0
... EIP is at flush_tlb_others+0x90/0xf0
(stack trace shows sys_init_module, parport_pc_init, ...
parport_announce_port,
 mcount, parport_pc_probe_port, parport_announce_port, __mcount,
parport_daisy_init, ...
 parport_wait_event, down_write_interruptible, error_code, show_stack,
etc.)
preempt count: 00010006
...
console shuts up...
Alt-Sysrq keys are recognized (displays command) but don't display any
data.
Will send whatever made it into to the system log shortly.
