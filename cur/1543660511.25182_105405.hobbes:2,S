I bought it as a generic enclosure (claiming to take cdrw/harddrive, no
mention of DVD).  I put my CDROM in it and it JustWorked(tm).  Same with
harddrives.  The plexcombo is the first thing I've put in it that
doesn't work.  I think I am going to do some more testing (I have a
friend with an iBook...) to find out where the problem lies.
Thanks for your help.
