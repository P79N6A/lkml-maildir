while reviewing the sysenter trampoline code i started wondering about the
HT case. Dont HT boxes share the MSRs between logical CPUs? This pretty
much breaks the concept of per-logical-CPU sysenter trampolines. It also
makes context-switch time sysenter MSR writing impossible, so i really
hope this is not the case.
