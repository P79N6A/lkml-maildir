Generally, why not, but I think Andrew has already pushed the patch to Linus,
so perhaps we can apply the changes on top of it?

Well, I think "access" is too weak here.  IMO we should say something like
"if you have booted without resuming and any journaled filesystems used before
the suspend have been mounted, you MUST NEVER EVER attempt to resume from the
'old' image.  In that case make sure the image is destroyed by running 'mkswap'
against the swap partition/file that contains it."
