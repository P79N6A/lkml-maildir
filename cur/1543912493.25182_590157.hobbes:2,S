Heh, thanks Randy.
All too often patches get missed since I don't happen to include the
right magic person to Cc. So I generally take a "better to have one Cc
too many than miss one" approach when sending patches - otherwise I
just end up resending it several times and eventually have to bother
Andrew to move it through -mm.
I see the point of people not getting things twice, but too many
patches slip through the cracks already (and not just my patches,
that's a general problem) so I'd rather inconvenience a few people
with one extra email than missing the proper maintainer by not Cc'ing
the right list.    Picking the right list/set of people to Cc is hard!
(whoops, mistakenly didn't do a reply-to-all initially; sorry Randy,
now you'll get this mail twice ;)
