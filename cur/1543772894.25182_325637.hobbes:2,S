2.6.11, and yes, although it's not set in the mount options.

Yes.

It's standard iozone --- mutliple processes writing to multiple files in
the same directory.
All the mount options are the defaults.
A sample test is:
mdadm -Ss
mdadm -C /dev/md0 -l 0 -c 1024 -n 2 -R  /dev/sdc /dev/sdk 
mke2fs -j  /dev/md0 
mount /dev/md0 /shift/oplapro97/data01
cd /shift/oplapro97/data01
iozone -MCew -t1 -f IOZONE -s32g -r256k -i0 -i1 > ~/tests/unsw_ext3/iozone_2_disk_1stream_ext3
rm -rf /shift/oplapro97/data01/*
iozone -MCew -t2 -f IOZONE -s32g -r256k -i0 -i1 > ~/tests/unsw_ext3/iozone_2_disk_2stream_ext3
