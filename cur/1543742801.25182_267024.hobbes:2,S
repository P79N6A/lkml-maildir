I have trouble with smart card readers and smart cards,
and somehow I think it might be kernel 2.6.*,
as people with the same hw and sw report no problems
with kernel 2.4.
Should I try this patch? anything in it that could help
me? or are there known problems?
In an strace I saw a poll/read loop read data and
got 8 bytes at a time. once it 16 bytes were lost.
I can't reproduce the errors, but they happen very
often (in every run of the regression test suite
I have).
I have no idea if my kernel config could have
anything to do with it, if it helps I will
post/link it.
