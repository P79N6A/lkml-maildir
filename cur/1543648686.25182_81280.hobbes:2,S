The AMD 8151 is AGP 3.0 compliant too, but the current driver is just
the page remapping support.  It's possible that some functionality
implemented both there and in agp3.c can be propagated both ways.
I'll look into this next week.
Despite it being support for a major protocol version bump, it's
still just another driver, which means it could go in after the
freeze if needbe.
Looks fine for merging afaics though.
