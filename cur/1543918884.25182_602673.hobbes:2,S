I'm sorry,I think I got your idea, if you do not need ptr in
my_task_that_may_sleep(), why you need to grab a reference to "ptr". If
your my_task_that_may_sleep() needs ptr, and according to the 
>"memory region pointed by "ptr" never be removed." you say,
it is ok to use "ptr" after rcu_read_ulock(). The basic idea behind RCU
is to split updates into "removal" and "reclamation" phases. If you
memory region pointed by "ptr" will not "reclamation" in sleep, it is ok
