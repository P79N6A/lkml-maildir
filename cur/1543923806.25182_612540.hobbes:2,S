Hi,
The 2.6.24-rc-git8 build fails with build error
  CC      drivers/pci/probe.o
drivers/pci/probe.c: In function 'pci_create_legacy_files':
drivers/pci/probe.c:56: error: implicit declaration of function 'class_device_create_bin_file'
drivers/pci/probe.c: In function 'pci_remove_legacy_files':
drivers/pci/probe.c:71: error: implicit declaration of function 'class_device_remove_bin_file'
make[2]: *** [drivers/pci/probe.o] Error 1
make[1]: *** [drivers/pci] Error 2
make: *** [drivers] Error 2
This is caused by the commit fcd239d3d5575e5cc63aab5c33cf6dc66904f6d6 (Driver core: remove class_device_*_bin_file).
These functions are still being used by drivers/pci/probe.c.
