The way you do this with the POSIX interface is to use the
low res CLOCKs.  Internally one would just set the
sub_jiffie in the struct timer_list to zero (as the
initialize code does).  This way the timer would always be
handled on the tick interrupt and would never cause a
"special" sub tick interrupt.
As the patch is currently written, it takes extra effort to
force a sub tick event (as it should) so one has to
"request" it.
