Ho hum, I'll have a poke at it this evening.
So...  what's the story here?  Should our position be that
CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED=n should only be used by distro kernel-builders,
who are concurrently shipping userspace which can handle it?  And that
these distros should (probably) set CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED=y in their
update kernels for older distributions?
