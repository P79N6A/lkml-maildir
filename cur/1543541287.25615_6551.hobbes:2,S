Sorry. There is only *one* call in the kernel to depmod.
Everything else is *not* kernel related at all.
<cite src="linux-2.4.0-test6/Makefile>
# If System.map exists, run depmod.  This deliberately does not have a
# dependency on System.map since that would run the dependency tree on
# vmlinux.  This depmod is only for convenience to give the initial
# boot a modules.dep even before / is mounted read-write.  However the
# boot script depmod is the master version.
ifeq "$(strip $(INSTALL_MOD_PATH))" ""
depmod_opts	:=
else
depmod_opts	:= -b $(INSTALL_MOD_PATH) -r
endif
.PHONY: _modinst_post
_modinst_post: _modinst_post_pcmcia
	if [ -r System.map ]; then $(DEPMOD) -ae -F System.map $(depmod_opts) $(KERNELRELEASE); fi

I cannot install newest modutils on our CPU servers (I'm no root
there!) and therefore can never do a sucessful
export INSTALL_MOD_PATH=$HOME
export INSTALL_PATH=$HOME
make oldconfig dep bzImage modules modules_install
same goes for this "build" symlink, which is also meaningless for
my purpose and ends up as a dangling link :-(
I also have a special install script, which replaces the one
under arch/i386/boot/install.sh and installs the Kernel
(including System.map) properly under $INSTALL_PATH/boot. 
So I also do a "make install" later and tar up $INSTALL_MOD_PATH
and $INSTALL_PATH, to put it at the slower hosts (like my
workstation or laptop (486, 8MB)).
Linus told us, that he likes the kernel to be buildable
everywhere. I don't know, whether this includes building it as
anybody, who has write access to the tree ;-)
