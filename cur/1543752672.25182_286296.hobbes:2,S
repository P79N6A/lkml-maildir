I do not run said machine, but I did have GCC crashes under similar large 
builds (notably the kernel) on one of my boxes.
It turned out the CPU was overheating and investigation revealed the heatsink 
paste was dried out (it is an old box, circa 1998 since paste was applied). 
As I only loaded the thing during GCC builds is why the problem revealed it's 
self.  A new heatsink and paste fixed it.
