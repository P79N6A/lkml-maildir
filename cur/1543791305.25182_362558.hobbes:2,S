Actually, it will.  Well, depending on terminology.
There are two usage models here - those which intend to remove physical
elements and those where the kernel returnss management of its virtualized
"physical" memory to a hypervisor.  In the latter case, a hypervisor
already maintains a virtual map of the memory and the OS needs to release
virtualized "physical" memory.  I think you are referring to RAM here as
the physical component; however these same defrag patches help where a
hypervisor is maintaining the real physical memory below the operating
system and the OS is managing a virtualized "physical" memory.
On pSeries hardware or with Xen, a client OS can return chunks of memory
to the hypervisor.  That memory needs to be returned in chunks of the
size that the hypervisor normally manages/maintains.  But long ranges
of physical contiguity are not required.  Just shorter ranges, depending
on what the hypervisor maintains, need to be returned from the OS to
the hypervisor.
In other words, if we can return 1 MB chunks, the hypervisor can hand
out those 1 MB chunks to other domains/partitions.  So, if we can return
500 1 MB chunks from a 2 GB OS instance, we can add 500 MB dyanamically
to another OS image.
This happens to be a *very* satisfactory answer for virtualized environments.
The other answer, which is harder, is to return (free) entire large physical
chunks, e.g. the size of the full memory of a node, allowing a node to be
dynamically removed (or a DIMM/SIMM/etc.).
So, people are working towards two distinct solutions, both of which
require us to do a better job of defragmenting memory (or avoiding
fragementation in the first place).
