Is that the end of the world?  Instead of having no information, we'll
end up with odd information.  If people complain, we can always
blacklist (indeed, won't the ACPI rolling blacklist catch the majority
of these machines?)

Not in terms of slot names.  There were various things that ACPI didn't
specify, like attention and latches, but the description of _SUN hasn't
changed.

Do you have any examples of this?
We should, IMO, be improving the way we tell users which device has
a problem.  'tulip7', 'eth4', 'pci 0000:04:1e.3' ... all the user wants
to know is which damn card it is so they can replace it.  And slot name
tells them that.
