Yep.

I did that first, and it pointed to  8527* as the bad one. During this bisect 
I took care to always start from a 2.6.24 .config, and do a make oldconfig from 
that. A clean series of good emerged.. Unfortunately I don't have the configs 
from the previous runs saved.
Given this, I concluded that the configs had to play a role in making a 
version go bad, so I decided to do another one between  8527* and 2.6.25-rc1
always based on the  8527* config (which _worked_ when tested with the 2.6.24 
config dragged forward. So the upped end of the first bisect was badly chosen)
The attahed was the result of that latter run...
