   Both of these are much more intresting then OS-A does X
   requests/sec while OS-B does Y requests/sec on a crazy hardware
   config, where X & Y are well beyond what 99.999998% of the market
   needs on a single server.
Standardized benchmarks often have little or nothing in common with
things like "real life" and "interesting".
It's quite simple, marketing departments at companies need some
"number" to tout around about their product.  A similar problem can be
seen in standardized academic tests like the SAT in the US, I nearly
failed mine, maybe that means I was meant to work at a gas station,
see? :-)
This is not to suggest that the "ideal" benchmark is craftable.
