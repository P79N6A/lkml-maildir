I want to give an update on FireWire (IEEE 1394) support for Linux:
All three drivers (Adaptec AIC-5800, TI PCILynx, OHCI) are now usable
and should not crash.  There is already a raw interface that allows
user space apps to send and receive over the bus, and a libraw1394
which is the supported interface to the kernel.  One tool, gnome1394,
already exists and can be used to manually initiate transactions.
Isochronous transmissions are not yet supported, that means digital
video over 1394 can not be used right now before anyone asks.  There
is also some standards compliancy missing.
Patches against both 2.2.11 and 2.3.14 are available from the project's
home at 
http://eclipt.uni-klu.ac.at/ieee1394/
 .  There you will also
find information about the mailing lists if you want to participate in
testing or developing.
Linus, I sent you the 2.3.13 patch on thursday (yep, a few hours before
2.3.14 came out), but didn't get an answer yet.  Do you consider it
worthy for inclusion in 2.3?
