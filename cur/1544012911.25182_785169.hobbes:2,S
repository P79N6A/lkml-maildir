So a month later this turns up in linux-next.  During the merge
window, giving a nice pile of rejects to keep me amused.
Can we do better than this, please?  A lot?

For better of for worse, we have a convention of using cpp-generated
helper functions for the buffer_head flags.  There's no reason why this
new code needs to diverge from that.  The above should use buffer_quiet().
The functions in fs/buffer.c have been nicely commented.
This function is poorly named.  What does "quiet_error" *mean*?
<tries to work it out>
Every caller of this function does `if (!quiet_error(bh))'.  Would it
not make more sense to invert the sense of its return value?
static int permit_bh_errors(struct buffer_head *bh)
{
	if (buffer_quiet(bh))
		return 0;	/* IO layer suppressed error messages */
	return printk_ratelimit();
}
Did I translate that right?  If so, then the addition of the
printk_ratelimit() to the non-buffer_quiet() buffers is an
unchangelogged and unrelated alteration.
The use of printk_ratelimit() needs some thought.  It shares
ratelimiting state with all other printk_ratelimit() callsites.  Was
that desirable?  Would it have been better to create a private
ratelimit_state for buffer_heads?  Per physical device?  Per
something-else?

And the above (which has coding-style errors and has apparently not been
checkpatched) should use set_buffer_quiet().

Add
+ BUFFER_FNS(Quiet, quiet)
around line 123 to generate the helper functions.
