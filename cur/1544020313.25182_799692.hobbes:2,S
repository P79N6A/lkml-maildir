This patch adds the PPS core support into Linux.
Currently I just propose the "core" so after inclusion we can add all
other related stuff as suggested by several people in this list. :)
PPS means "pulse per second" and its API is specified by RFC 2783
(Pulse-Per-Second API for UNIX-like Operating Systems, Version 1.0).
The code has been tested with the NTPD program
(
http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/ntp/html/index.html
) and several GPS
antennae.
Changelog
=========
Version [full patchset] -> 1
----------------------------
* stupid filenames removed.
* kernel-doc documentation of exported symbols.
* old BKL-locked ioctl removed.
* !uarg checks in the ioctls removed. 
* pps.h revisited but not splitted, since several stuff are shared between
  kernel and user land (I hope this will not stop inclusion...)
