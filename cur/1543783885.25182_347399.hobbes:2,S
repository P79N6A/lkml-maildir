For a single-user system errors=panic is definitely very useful on the
system disk, since that's the only way that we can force an fsck, and
also abort a server that might be failing and returning erroneous
information to its clients.  Think of it is as i/o fencing when you're
not sure that the system is going to be performing correctly.
Whether or not this is useful for ocfs2 is a different matter.  If
it's only for data volumes, and if the only way to fix filesystem
inconsistencies on a cluster filesystem is to request all nodes in the
cluster to unmount the filesystem and then arrange to run ocfs2's fsck
on the filesystem, then forcing every single cluster in the node to
panic is probably counterproductive.  :-)
