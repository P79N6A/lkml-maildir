I think Paul was going to take it, or at least Geert hinted as such.

Indeed, it's universally 512 or << 9, just use that...

What would be the point of such a helper? I've never seen a need for it.
Geert uses it as debug code here, but the fact is that the number of
bios in a request is a pretty pointless number. It doesn't tell you
anything. There's no 1:1 mapping between bios and segments (or anything
else for that matter), so the exercise is purely pointless.
