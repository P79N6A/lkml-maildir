Greetings;
I just had to reboot back to -mm2 after playing with some printer configs in
cups, although the test pages worked, so I'm not sure what this all about,
from var log/messages:
Sep  8 23:13:42 coyote cups: cupsd -HUP succeeded
Sep  8 23:13:43 coyote kernel: usb_unlink_urb() is deprecated for synchronous unlinks.  Use usb_kill_urb()
Sep  8 23:13:43 coyote kernel: Badness in usb_unlink_urb at drivers/usb/core/urb.c:456

Sep  8 23:13:44 coyote kernel:  [<c010425d>] sysenter_past_esp+0x52/0x71
repeat about 40-50 times before I rebooted cause it was very sluggish.
cups is 1.1.21-rc2, from rpm.
