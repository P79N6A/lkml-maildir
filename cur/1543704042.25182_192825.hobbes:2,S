The time it takes is beside the point.  If I find a bug, I'll write it up and
send it in -- but I'm not going to jump through arbitrary hoops to do it.  I
may as well just fork the code and fix the damned thing myself :).
If they want to close their list, fine -- but then they should set up a
separate bug-submission address which is open.
