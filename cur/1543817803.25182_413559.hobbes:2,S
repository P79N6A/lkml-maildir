That change looks correct to me, and I see that it's gone in.
It made me think of another issue affecting the accounting records in
related circumstances when the old group leader died after a non-leader exec.
I think this patch addresses that, and along with your patch, gives more
sensible times in all cases.
Thanks,
Roland
[PATCH] Take original leader's start_time in non-leader exec.
The only record we have of the real-time age of a process, regardless of
execs it's done, is start_time.  When a non-leader thread exec, the
original start_time of the process is lost.  Things looking at the
real-time age of the process are fooled, for example the process
accounting record when the process finally dies.  This change makes the
oldest start_time stick around with the process after a non-leader exec.
This way the association between PID and start_time is kept constant,
which seems correct to me.
