Removing this reduces a lot of might_sleep coverage scope. Page
lock isn't contended in a lot of cases. Why would you drop a
good debugging feature?

This one is unneeded because you didn't take the fsync livelock avoidance

Lockdep should catch this, I guess.

This could just be implemented with a VM_BUG_ON (or FS_BUG_ON) like the
pagecache refcounting. Wouldn't be a bad idea.

Again, why not an FS_BUG_ON for things like this too?
