In case someone is interested...
Windows 2000 SP1 now has the Realtek 8139 (Celeron 433, 192 MB, pure
SCSI); drivers as shipped with W2K. Using a 40 MB test file over FTP, I
get
  Realtek card sends with 3.5 MB/s
  Realtek card receives with 5 MB/s
The system that previously contained the 8139 card now has a (10 MBit)
8029 card - transfer rates with that card are about 850 KB/s, compared to
the 400KB/s to 530 KB/s with the (100 MBit) 8139 card.
This makes me conclude that there is some pretty serious problem left in
the 8139too driver.
