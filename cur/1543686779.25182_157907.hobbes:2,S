Hmm, that would mean that bufer in kernel is different than 16kb which is not 
true on UP x86 machines:
if defined(CONFIG_MULTIQUAD) || defined(CONFIG_IA64)
#define LOG_BUF_LEN     (65536)
#elif defined(CONFIG_ARCH_S390)
#define LOG_BUF_LEN     (131072)
#elif defined(CONFIG_SMP)
#define LOG_BUF_LEN     (32768)
#else
#define LOG_BUF_LEN     (16384)                 /* This must be a power of two 
*/
#endif
USB messages are filling whole buffer for me on my UP x86 machine so I don't 
see any messages before usb after fresh boot :(
Maybe this value should be increased in kernel to 32768 on UP, too?
