Subject: [PATCH] 2.4.20 fix file_readahead for ide-cd and ide-floppy
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The file_readahead setting in ide-cd and ide-floppy obviously
assumed read-ahead values are kept as bytes. This made them
totally useless. This patch unifies file_readahead with ide-disk
making values be stored correctly as pages and displayed as KB.
This also changes breada setting to match ide-disk as well (is it
really used at all? It appears the only place where it is referenced
is reiserfs).
The patch is agains Mandrake sources but as I assume it should apply to vanilla kernel as well.
cheers
