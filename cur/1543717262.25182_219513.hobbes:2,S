Thanks.
Rene, can you send me copies of /proc/ide/hda/identify and
/proc/ide/hdc/identify?  I still would like to know why these
drives don't accept flush cache commands (or it is a driver's bug?).

There is a problem with new 2.6 generic ->shutdown framework,
it doesn't differentiate between reboot / halt and power_off.
We may try to fix it or revert to 2.4 way of doing things if
this is too big change for 2.6.
Thanks,
Bartlomiej
