I would suggest a "semi-closed" List.
All Mails from know E-Mail Adresses can pass and only mails from unknown
addresses must be approved by a moderator.
This way everybody can post to the list. And except of the first Mail
there wouldn't be any delays.
(Yes i know that isn't perfect, but IMHO better than doing nothing)
Bis denn
