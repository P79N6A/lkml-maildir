The patch came from me, as part of the patch kit to make the kernel
safe(r) for the Pentium IV processor. There were several places
which made unwarranted assumptions about ->x86 not exceeding 6, and
they would break since Pentium IV has family 15.
[Reading #243192 ...]
Concerning the microcode update driver, I cannot find anything in
the IA32-Vol3 manual to suggest it is not P6 specific.
The Pentium IV is not a P6, hence the stricter test.
Of course, this should be reviewed once the PentiumIV-updated
IA32-Vol3 manual has been released.
You say the manuals suggest testing for family >= 6.
Exactly which manual does that, and where?
(But I should have passed the patch to you Tigran before Linus.
Mea culpa, but it seemed such an obvious bug&fix ...)
