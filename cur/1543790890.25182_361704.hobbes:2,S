Hence the -mm tree, which takes stuff that may still need to be debugged.  
Except that it has this nasty habit of taking stuff which still needs to be 
debugged from people _other_than_you_, which screws you up.  You seem to want 
a tree where the only stuff likely to break is your stuff, which is another 
popular option: maintaining your own developer tree.  Getting people to _use_ 
such a tree takes a bit of work, but that's not news to anybody.
Think about what you're asking for here.  Imagine that other people _also_ get 
what you're asking for, at the same time.  Is it still what you want?
Right now patches go from developer tree, to -mm tree, to -linus tree, with a 
larger audience each time.  The _reason_ linus's tree has a larger audience 
is exactly _because_ the patches in it have had more testing so it's less 
likely to break.  And the releases have a way larger audience than Linus's 
-rc releases, and the distro kernels have a larger audience than that...
