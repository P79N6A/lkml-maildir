The problem i was experiencing (albeit with 2.4.10-ac11) was losing
connectivity for 2-10s at a time, no messages in the logs, and the machine
would resume activity as normal afterwards. The machine is connected to
the network via two NICs (3c59x and eepro100) and i only get these freezes
when connecting to the IP address on the eepro100. Unfortunately, due to
the lack of error messages, this report doesn't help much. But i was
wondering wether this was what some people were experiencing.
connected via switch with moderately high network load (general purpose
server)

PS i have 2.4.17-pre5 and so far haven't noticed it, but haven't done much
testing either.
