OK, it gets an interrupt when I manually generate it with asm("int $42");
Applicom driver: $Id: ac.c,v 1.6 1999/02/05 16:11:55 dwmw2 Exp $
Applicom PCI board found at mem 0xf4101800, irq 10
Applicom interrupt on IRQ 10 occurred
APPLICOM 0xF4101800 - 1 card(s) installed driver V2.8.0
Should I then assume that they're lying to me, and there _is_ some magic 
incantation to get their board to generate IRQs, or is there something in the 
PCI setup that I (and Greg) might have missed?

Is this something I can do with the generic PCI handling code? I don't have 
much of a spec for the card. The ISA card works OK, and I was told that the 
PCI one should be identical.
As you can see, I've tried a few strange things with PCI, in case it helped...
     for (i=1; i<= MAX_PCI_DEVICE_NUM && !dev; i++)
            {
              dev = pci_find_device(PCI_VENDOR_ID_APPLICOM, 
                                    i,
                                    NULL);
            }
          if (dev)
            {
           /*    unsigned short pcicmd; */
/*            if (pci_read_config_word(dev, PCI_COMMAND, &pcicmd)) { */
/*                 printk("ac.o: error accessing PCI regs\n"); */
/*            } */
/*            else */
/*              { */
/*                printk("Setting IO capability and mastering\n"); */
/*                pci_write_config_word(dev, PCI_COMMAND, pcicmd | PCI_COMMAND_I
O);      */
/*                pci_set_master(dev); */
/*              } */
              mem = dev->base_address[0];
              irq = dev->irq;
              printk(KERN_INFO "Applicom %s found at mem 0x%lx, irq %d\n",applic
om_pci_devnames[dev->device-1], mem, irq);
            }       
 // else return ENODEV;
 
   RamIO = (unsigned char *)ioremap(mem, LEN_RAM_IO * MAX_BOARD );
    
 if (request_irq(irq, &ac_interrupt, SA_SHIRQ, "Applicom", &ac_open))
        {
                printk("Could not allocate IRQ %d for Applicom device. Exiting.\
n", irq);
                iounmap((void *)RamIO);
                return -ENXIO;
        }
        asm volatile ("int $42"); // raise IRQ10

How are interrupts handled on Intel UP machines? I always assumed that there 
was a single 'IRQ' line to the CPU, and the handler for that interrogated the 
PIC to find out which interrupt was raised. I can't find that code in the 
kernel though - it seems as if PIC interrupts are generating INT 0x20-0x2f 
directly. What am I missing?
