Ditto.  the right response.
| i'd be happy to, but based on my previous experience sending
| in a few patches, it's just not worth the aggravation any more.
| 
| just one of my patches that got adopted took, literally, several
| weeks of being dropped on the floor with no reason why.  and i
| had to resubmit it, slightly updated, for every BK rev of the
| kernel since the previous patch wouldn't apply cleanly --
| it might be a line or two off, which would require remaking
| the patch and resubmitting it *again*.  at which point, it
| would be dropped on the floor *again*.
| 
| don't get me wrong -- i understand that there has to be some
| form of QA in accepting kernel patches, and after a while, 
| regular submitters can build up a reputation.
and the QA is on patches, not (so much) on dialog.
| but, at this point, it's not terribly useful to encourage people
| to submit patches if those patches are just tossed.
| 
| it's like the classic catch-22:
| 
|   "we can't hire you.  you don't have enough experience doing
|     this job."
|   "ok, so how do i get experience?"
|   "well, you have to do this job for a while."
| 
| uh, right.  so, while there's not much point in my submitting
| patches, i can still toss suggestions from the sidelines, unless
| you have some ideas.  i'm certainly open to advice.
But suggestions from the sidelines are just too close to whinging
(Brit. spelling :) and moaning.  Not very helpful.
