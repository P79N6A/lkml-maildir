Hi,
We are runing Redhat Enterprise Linux AS 2.1 ( kernel
2.4.9-e.40) on a 
Dell 2650 box. There is a need in our application for
a user to belong 
to more than 32 groups. Is there a way to recompile
the kernel to 
support more than 32 supplementary groups ? 
I'm not a subscriber of the mailing list. Please CC me
your 
answers/comments posted to the list. Any help would be
greatly appreciated.
Brian Gao
