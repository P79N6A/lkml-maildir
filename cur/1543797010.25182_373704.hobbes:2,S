Hmm, this sounds a lot like the BIOS insanity we saw on one cheapo  
Chaintech board.  We knew it was bad when the thing reported in its  
boot display that the CPU was an "Intel Athlon".  Things only got  
worse from there; but sadly there was no BIOS update, and we ended up  
throwing away the $35 board just on general principles :-D.

There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to  
make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the  
other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious  
deficiencies.  The first method is far more difficult.
