Yes, exactly what I had in mind.  In other words, do the check when a 
!uptodate buffer is read.  This can go in ext2_bread, which already has 
dir-specific code in it (readahead), and ext2_getblk remains generic, 
for what it's worth.

I went through your patch and distilled out the stylistic changes you 
made.  I simplified the INDEX_FL handling along the lines you suggested 
and factored out a ext2_add_compat_feature routine among other 
incremental improvements.  I'll post the update tomorrow.
I did not attempt to address the check_ issue this time round.

For a completely empty page that's the right thing to do, much better 
than hanging as it does now.  We don't want to try to repair damage on 
the fly do we?
Now, if the check routine tells us how much good data it found we could 
use that to set a limit for the dirent scan, thus keeping the same 
robustness as the old code but without having all the checks in the 
inner loop.  Or.  We could have separate loops for good blocks and bad 
blocks, it's just a very small amount of code.
