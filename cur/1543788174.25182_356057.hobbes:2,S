Alan,
meanwhile we could generate a strace for the problem.
However, I guess that the strace does not give the desired
information (see parts below).
Additionally we added in the program the output of the return
value of the accept() system call . The return value is -512
and the errno value is 0!
Usually the return value should be -1 and the errno  should
contain the value without the sign of the error.
Any idea or comment on this ?
Thanks,
Peter Düllings
