Isolcpus will be using this code, but it does not need to be converted
in the kernel.  Isolated_cpu_setup() gets its string from the command
line and then makes the call to get_options with that string.  There is
a reference to the format of isolcpus= in kernel-parameters.txt, that
could reflect this enhancement.
Instead of:
Format: <cpu number>,...,<cpu number>
change to:
Format <cpu number>,...,<cpu number>-<cpu number>
<cpu number>-<cpu number> must be a positive range in ascending order.
