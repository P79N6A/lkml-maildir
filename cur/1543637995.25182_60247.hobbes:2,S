Hello Alan,
And a further small point to help me clear things up things cleanly...
>You will get connections completing, they will time out. If you expect

>seeing it on the connect. 
Perhaps also to further clarify the meaning og backlog in 2.4.  
The situation is this:
1. Pending requests up to backlog are always established.
2. Pending requests in excess of backlog are established, but may 
timeout if not accepted() in a timely fashion.
Have I got it right?
Cheers
Michael
