It's doable[1], but I'm not sure that the added complexity is worth of it.
I'm suprised that you see a big improvement. I'd expect that the image
write is bottlenecked by the disk performance. On my PC (Core2, locked
at 1.6GHz) lzf can compress 250-280MB/s; even with an older CPU that can
do 1/3 it's still more than the disk can handle.

[1] We may even use MPI to compress over a Beowulf cluster, it's
userspace ;)
