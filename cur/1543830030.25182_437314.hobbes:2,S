in a fully hierarchical system (not that I really think
this is required here) you would be able to 'delegate'
certain addresses (ranges) to a namespace (the child)
below the current one (the parent) with the ability to
limit/control the input/output (which is required for 
security)

what we are desperately missing here is a proper way
to testing this, maybe the network folks can come up
with some test equipment/ideas here ...

well, have you ever tried how much you can achieve

well, local is fine, but you cannot utilize that 
on-wire which basically means that you would have
either to 'map' the MAC on transmission (to the
real one) which would basically make the approach
useless, or to use addresses which are fine within
a certain range of routers ...

sure you can make up MACs, but you will never
be able to use them 'outside' the box

well, for loopback that would mean half the bandwidth
and twice the latency, no?

why? duplicate stack traversal takes roughly twice
the time, or am I wrong here? if so, please enlighten
me ...
