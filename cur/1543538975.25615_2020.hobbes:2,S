The man page for fclose says:
       Upon successful completion 0 is returned.  Otherwise,  EOF
       is  returned and the global variable errno is set to indi<AD>
       cate  the  error.   In  either  case  any  further  access
       (including another call to fclose()) to the stream results
       in undefined behaviour.
the suspicion is that fclose has already been called on the
stream, and so the second call to fclose results in the "undefined
behaviour" described above.  this can include a SEGV.
