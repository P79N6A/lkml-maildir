Neither do I, considering that the user can switch async scanning on
at any later time with the scan=async module option. The absence
of the async scan wait module will only screw things up for him later.
But then I don't consider an argument made out yet for doing this
via a separate module in the first place. scsi_wait_scan just does
_not_ want/deserve/need to be a module.
Of course, whining is useless, and discussions on lkml tend to be
most constructive / progressive only over code, so I'll try and see
if I can learn enough of the code in there to fix a patch to do the
async scan waiting thing using some other mechanism; this
module thing seems just horribly wrong/unnecessary.
