thanks - the numbers are pretty convincing. I've applied most of your 
patch (except the instrumentation bits), and it seems to work quite well 
- one of my testsystems that had interrupt storms before can now run 
IOAPIC_FAST. (i also enabled the option to be selectable for SMP kernels 
too. If things work out fine we can make it default-on.) I've uploaded 
the -50-39 patch with these changes included.
