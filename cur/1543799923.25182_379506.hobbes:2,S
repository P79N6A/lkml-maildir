Hello!
The TerraTec MIDI HUBBLE USB device provides two MIDI IN and OUT ports, 
but it seems to lack the correct interface class value (see attached 
output of lsusb -v). I thought this could be fixed by adding the 
following to sound/usb/usbquirks.h:
{
        USB_DEVICE_VENDOR_SPEC(0x0ccd, 0x0032),
        .driver_info = (unsigned long) & (const snd_usb_audio_quirk_t) {
                .vendor_name = "TerraTec Producer",
                .product_name = "MIDI HUBBLE",
                .ifnum = 0,
                .type = QUIRK_MIDI_STANDARD_INTERFACE
        }
},
But the USB subsystem still doesn't know it can use the snd_usb_audio 
driver for this device (e.g. shown by usbmodules), and it is not 
registered as an ALSA card. Is there anything I have to do in addition 
to this, or did I do something wrong? The files modules.alias and 
modules.usbmap got updated correctly, but I don't know who reads them 
at what time.
The strangest thing is that it worked on one day, even though I had not 
done anything special yet.
I hope you can help me. Thank you very much in advance.
BTW: I thought about posting this in the linux-sound mailing list, but 
it seems to be dead. Posts are almost never answered, including a post 
I made about a solution to another sound problem 
(http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-sound&m=113261865703607&w=2). 
(Since then, a few people who have the same problem have contacted me; 
all of them would like the fix to be integrated into the kernel.)
