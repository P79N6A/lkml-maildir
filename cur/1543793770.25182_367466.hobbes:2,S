yeah - i left it on by default, i usually do that with new debugging 
features, to give new code more exposure. In other words, mass 
distributed RCU stress-testing by stealth ;-)
I'll make it default-off once the RCU related changes have calmed down.  
The rcutorture kernel threads run at nice +19 so they should be barely 
noticeable. (except for a sudden and unexplained spike in the world's 
power consumption, and the resulting energy crisis ;-)
