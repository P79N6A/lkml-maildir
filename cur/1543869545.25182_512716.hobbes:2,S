Hi Jeff,
I'll be resending the series of incremental patches originally submitted 
on 02/22/07.
The series take in account Yoshifuji's comments.
Patch 2 - ioctl cleanup - is updated to secure backward compatibility.
The ioctls are now explicitly numbered.
Patch 6 is also updated with minor changes:
some comments are modified /* .. */  instead of // ..
The other patches remain unchanged.
Cheers,
Divy
