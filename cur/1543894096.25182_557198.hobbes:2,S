Good for you! :-) If this is standard syslogd, please send a patch
to the maintainer.

It doesn't matter that much.  With swap, you get a slowdown
as memory is used up, and eventually oom-kill when swap too runs out.
With swap, you run at full speed until you hit the wall.
Swapping is nice on a desktop machine, because:
* Light swapping is not a problem, so you can do work that
   would otherwise be impossible
* Heavy swapping is noticeable, so you close some apps in a
   civilized manner, instead of having the oom-killer
   surprising you.
This may or may not apply to your RT setup.

Yes.  You can never trust the oom-killer to do the "right thing"
in all circumstances - as you discovered. It can probably be improved on,
but there will be corner cases anyway.
When you use overcommit, the oom-killer is the alternative to having
the machine halt when it can't keep the promise of more memory.

I think so. You might want to modify "r" depending on how much your kernel
actually uses.
Note that not overcommitting tends to run out of memory very fast,
because of the way fork() is used. When a program forks,
it becomes two processes that initially shares all memory.
That means they don't use more memory after the fork().
But the memory will be spent as soon as one process changes
its memory, for the change is not supposed to be seen in
the other process. Without overcommit then, the kernel will
allow the fork() only if there is enough memory left to
copy the entire process being forked.  This is often
unnecessary in practice - if you have several shells running then
they share lots of memory that they never actually will need
to duplicate.  Overcommit is therefore popular, it lets
you run much more software as long as it behaves this way.
Another solution: Set memory_overcommit to 2. And get some swap.
The swap will never actually be _used_, unless you get so many
allocations that the oom-killer would have stepped in without swap.
You can then monitor swapping.  If anything is written to swap,
then you're using too much memory and should investigate.
For production, this is usually better than cleaning up after
the oom-killer busted some random processes.
