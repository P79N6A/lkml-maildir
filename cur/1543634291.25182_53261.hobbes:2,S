I see one: the space consumed by the explicitly managed stack is
known and control may be exerted over it. Also, the stack space
consumed by procedure calls is great enough on various non-x86 cpus
to make even shallow recursions problematic (ISTR 96B-120B/call with
a 4KB page in some prior discussions).
Cheers,
