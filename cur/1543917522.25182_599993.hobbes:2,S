Subject: [mm] Better help needed for UEVENT_HELPER_PATH
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Current help for CONFIG_UEVENT_HELPER_PATH is:
   Path to uevent helper program forked by the kernel for
   every uevent.
With default value of /sbin/hotplug.
Help! I don't have /sbin/hotplug (Debian unstable, using udev).
What do I do now? Will my hardware be unsupported because I don't have
/sbin/hotplug?
Should I leave it at the default? Make it empty? Or do I need to replace 
hotplug by some other magic command?
Please extend the help text to give some context and indication of how to 
use this option.
