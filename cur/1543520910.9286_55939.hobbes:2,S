I realize that CPUs are speeding up at an amazing rate, but being 
in the semiconductor industry, I know that the technology is 
reaching a minimun size because we are approaching atomic 
dimensions.  Since speed is not only about power, but how far you 
have to go, an essential factor in increasing speed is to decrease 
the distance you have to go.  Then add the fact that most 
motherboards are essentialy a bunch of RF transmission lines, I 
honestly don't see hardware speeding up much more.  At 1 Ghz, 
we are talking about waveguides, not wires.
Add this to the fact that many old 486s have been 'revived' with 
Linux, and I think we will still have 32-bit CPUs around come the 
year 2038.  
The argument that we won't have to deal with it in xx years sure 
sounds like the same one that got us into Y2K in the first place. 
They say oh, but this is different because.....I don't know that I buy 
into that.  It seems to me it is more an issue that 'we have too 
many other problems, and maybe that one will go away before we 
have to deal with it'.
