 # Uhm ... big deal. Don't all SPARC and UltraSPARC CPU's have serial numbers

Not only that, but I've heard from the naysayers that the concept of
having ANY unique ID in your computer is bad. The first thing I thought of
was MAC addresses. All those cable modem/ADSL users already have a method
of identifying themselves given the right software (no, not arp).
Also, don't BIOSs carry ID stamps, too?
G'day!
