Ugh. I must confess I am disappointed, Linus. I thought you had better taste.
Yes, the above code is correct. And yes, gcc should be more aggressive to
recognize that the above code is unambiguous. But that doesn't change the fact
that the code is UGLY AS HELL. Nor does it change the fact that each comparison
is broken if taken separately.
You make two UNSIGNED comparisons when you clearly mean to make two SIGNED
comparisons, and you call that _good_ code? Hmm.

Really? How so? We _know_ that the result of sizeof() fits confortably within
"int"'s range. So the natural way to write that comparison would be
	if (len <= (int) sizeof(short) || len > (int) sizeof(*sunaddr))
which is 100% correct, 100% obvious, and does not break horribly if you
remove one of the comparisons.
The compiler also _knows_ that. But the compiler can't change the implicit 
cast, because it would make it incompatible with every other compiler on
the planet. Yes, standards suck sometimes. So compiler warns us instead.
I consider that a feature.
