Please note that not every patch submitted and is added to this patch.
However all of them are in queue.
If you have submitted any patches in the past 2 months please resend.
I do expect some breakage in various archs; however, this change is to
allow them to have a native MMIO migration path.  Additionally a second
data-phase transport layer will be developed for SerialATA and all future
MMIO native Host-Controllers.  Please be away Ultra133 in the future will
require MMIO transport or Virtual DMA accross the PCI-DMA bus to the next
generation of ATA-Bridges.
Respectfully,
