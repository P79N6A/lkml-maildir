(Does this only apply to elf?)
If the old process has 64-bit virtual address space and the new process has
32-bit, you want to unmap the 64-bit space, yes?
And if the old process is 32-bit and the new process is 64-bit (possible?)
you want to unmap the 32-bit space.  But unmapping 64-bit space here is
harmless, yes?
Yes, it would be more logical to still be running with the personality of the
old process when we try to expunge all its mappings.  However I suspect we
need all those mappings to grab the exec arguments.
How about we make exit_mmap() be independent of the personality again by
doing something like this?
Looks like ia64 needs work, too...
