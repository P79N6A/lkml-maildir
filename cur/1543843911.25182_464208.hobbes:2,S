yeah - but i think to make it easier for SystemTap to insert a 
low-overhead probe there needs to be a 5-byte NOP inserted. There wont 
be any function call or condition at that place. At most there will be 
some minimal impact on the way gcc compiles the code in that function, 
to make sure that the data is not optimized out and is available to 
SystemTap. For example at the point of the probe gcc might already have 
destroyed a register-passed function parameter. (but normally there 
should be any effect, because it's pointless to trace data that gcc 
optimizes out.)
