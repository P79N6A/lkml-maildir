I seriously demand that this be changed into "RTC broekn under..."! :)

BTW2, 2.6.15 has an option in ALSA to use RTC as timing source 
(CONFIG_SND_RTCTIMER). I do not have it activated ATM, nor do I use it (as 
said, I used "-ao null" for mplayer), but would use of alsa with this rtc 
timesourcing also crash?

Well, it did not deadlock my system. Interesting! It displayed "BUG", as 
posted multiple times here. Otherwise, it just oopsed. That is, I could 
continue using the system, with the exception, of course, /dev/rtc. Opening 
rtc however did not lock a process trying to do so, but instead (as 
designed in the code) returns -EBUSY.

This patch fixes the rtc BUG for me.
