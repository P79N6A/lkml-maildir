I'm curious as to what boot argument equivalent you envision for e.g.
options ne io=0x280,0x300 irq=10,12 bad=0,1

As a related issue, this will allow me (or whoever) to kill off the
ether=x,y,z,ethN boot argument for compiled in ethernet drivers at
the same time.  It made sense back in 1.0/1.2 days when distro kernels 
were shipped with everything compiled in and ISA cards were the norm.  
Now it is hardly used and generally a PITA to support.
Paul.
