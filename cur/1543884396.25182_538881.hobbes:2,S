Windows XP doesn't use MMCONFIG or any extended configuration space. I 
believe Vista is supposed to, though. Not sure how they are handling 
this issue.

Can you post what your board has for PNPACPI reserved resources (I 
believe they're in /sys/devices/pnp0/*/resources IIRC, don't have a 
Linux box handy right now). Full dmesg would also be useful, I think it 
dumps out those reservations at boot nowadays..
