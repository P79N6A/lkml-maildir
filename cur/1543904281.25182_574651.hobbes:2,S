Hi,
it seems your "Libata status" page needs some update.
"
      NVIDIA
Driver name: *sata_nv*
Summary: No TCQ/NCQ in early chipsets. NCQ support added in later 
chipsets. Looks like a PATA controller, but with full SATA control 
including hotplug and PM.
*Update:* NVIDIA has provided information (under NDA) that permits 
implementation of NCQ support, and a sample Linux implementation 
<
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/jgarzik/libata/archive/2.6.17-nv-adma.patch.bz2>
 
(patch) as well. Unfortunately, the patch needs debugging, and no one 
seems to have the time or motivation.
*NOTE:* Newer NVIDIA chipsets are AHCI 
<
http://linux-ata.org/driver-status.html#ahci>,
 and use the ahci driver 
rather than the sata_nv driver.
"
There have been changes since you wrote the above.
ADMA has been incorporated mainstream for a while now
and SWNCQ is now in -mm. AHCI support is obvious.
Best regards,
Zoltán Böszörményi
