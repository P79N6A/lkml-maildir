In top-level Makefile we already distingush between external modules and
internal modules. See the different calls to Makefile.modpost
Could you try updating your patch so in the normal case we exit with
a fail in case of unresolved symbols but if a specific flag is specified
we only warn on unresolved symbols.
And then introduce the nw flag only for external modules in the
top-level Makefile.
