Yes, I can try - but I'd like to know the exact reason (I'm not developing UML 
as long as Jeff does).
My idea is that ghash.h is just trivial boilerplate which does not deserve 
generalized code, so that even rewriting the same exact code without using 
those macros (and maybe embedding some assumptions about this usage) would be 
a fine solution; also, there is just one user of it 
(arch/um/kernel/physmem.c, with just one hash defined), so it shouldn't be 
hard.
However, if the problem with ghash.h is different, I need more explainations.
