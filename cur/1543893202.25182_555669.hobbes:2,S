I have noticed such problems before - the depmod code just loads whole
module files into memory.  The situation is especially bad when
module-init-tools is configured with --enable-zlib - in this case memory
for all module files is allocated with malloc().  (Without --enable-zlib
depmod just mmaps all module files, which at least does not eat swap,
and probably does not bring unused pages into memory.)
I have made some patches to module-init-tools - unfortunately, they
probably don't apply to the current version (they were based on
v3.3-pre4):
