So, what did we decide? To bloat bio a bit (add a queue pointer) or to
use physical device limits? The latter requires to replace all occurence
of bio->bi_bdev = something_new with blk_set_bdev(bio, somthing_new),
where queue limits will be appropriately charged. So far I'm testing
second case, but I only changed DST for testing, can change all other
users if needed though.
