Yes, that's what I did.

yes too because I don't have enough time to try many combinations this week-end.

If you look at the CS column in vmstat, you'll see that there's about twice
as many context switches with CFS than with SD, meaning the average timeslice
would be about twice as short with CFS. But my impression is that some tasks
occasionally get very long timeslices with SD while this never happens with
CFS, hence the very smooth versus jerky feeling which cannot be explained
by just halved timeslices alone.

It is possible that only measurement is wrong because the time was evenly
distributed among the 64 processes. Maybe the fix could also prevent some
tasks from occasionally stealing one slice and reduce the jerkiness feeling.
Anyway, it's just a bit jerky, no more freezes as we've known for years ;-)

You're welcome !
