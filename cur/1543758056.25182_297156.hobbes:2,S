The most important thing about a /proc file format is that it has
a documented means of being extended in the future. Without such
documentation, it is impossible to write a reliable parser.
The "Name: value" stuff is rather slow. Right now procps (ps, top, etc.)
is using a perfect hash function to parse the /proc/*/status files.
("man gperf") This is just plain gross, but needed for decent performance.
Extending the /proc/*/maps file might be possible. It is commonly used
by debuggers I think, so you'd better at least verify that gdb is OK.
The procps "pmap" tool uses it too. To satisfy the procps parser:
a. no more than 31 flags
b. no '/' prior to the filename
c. nothing after the filename
d. no new fields inserted prior to the inode number

The more info the better. See the pmap "-x" option, currently missing
some data that the kernel does not supply. There are numerous other     
pmap options that are completely unimplemented because of the lack of   
info. See the Solaris 10 man page for pmap, available on Sun's web site.
