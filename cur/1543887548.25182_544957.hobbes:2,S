I think so far we've found that it fixes the MySQL scalability problem,
yes. I couldn't see any statistically significant difference with MySQL
in my tests with MADV_FREE (versus MADV_DONTNEED).
ebizzy is improved a bit at low concurrency but drops off slightly at
higher concurrency.
But basically, I don't think we've found a good reason to use a page
flag and introduce the potential performance regressions that the
MADV_FREE patch has.
