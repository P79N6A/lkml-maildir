"wants"?  Things happen for reasons other than the user explicitly willing
them to happen.
Anyway, an OS is supposed to be helpful, not insulting.

Political correctness has nothing to do with it.  If the user is stupid,
they're stupid; heck, we expect that they are.  But I'm not stupid, and too
many times I've ejected the wrong PCMCIA card or unplugged the wrong USB
device or tripped over a cord somewhere or even pushed the eject button on
the wrong floppy drive (though few machines have two floppies any longer).
It is probably beyond the realm of possibility to handle all of these user
fuckups, but to say that trying is a worthless goal because anyone who
hopes that they work is an idiot seems to me to be a rather defeatist
attitude.
