Hi djgera,
Anton isn't ignoring you, he's just extremely busy.
> total 191 warnings fixed!!! (it took enough hours to me)
Wow, thank you very much.  You've done an amazing job.
I've read through the patch (yawn) and tested it.  I found a couple of
problems (debug only), but they weren't your fault.  Several of the
ntfs_debug's had the wrong arguments.  I've rebuilt the patch and put it
here:

> Please review, and confirm to Marcelo Tosatti
Now we just need to keep poking Anton :-)
Thanks for your hard work.
Cheers,
