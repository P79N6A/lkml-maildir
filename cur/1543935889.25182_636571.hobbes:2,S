Hi Rik,
How much trouble am I asking for if I were to try to get your patchset
to fly on a fairly recent "stable" kernel (e.g. 2.6.22.15)?  If
workable, is such an effort before it's time relative to your TODO?
I see that you have an old port to a FC7-based 2.6.21 here:
http://people.redhat.com/riel/vmsplit/
Also, do you have a public git repo that you regularly publish to for
this patchset?  If not a git repo do you put the raw patchset on some
http/ftp server?
thanks,
Mike
