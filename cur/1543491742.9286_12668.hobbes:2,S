Hello David,
I've been using your previous patch for a long time(since 13 Mar).  
Below is the result from dmesg.  Could you please help out a little
though by making a unified patch with diff -urN.  It makes it easier
whenever there are other patches in the same module and adjustments are
necessary. BTW I have 128MB SDRAM.
Thanks,
Albert
