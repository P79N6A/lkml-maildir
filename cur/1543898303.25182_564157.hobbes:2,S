Actually I have to ask.  How in the world are these absolute symbols
ok from a relocation perspective.
If the kernel is not running at 0xc0100000 the offset value looks like
it will be completely bogus.
Maybe those are ok, but if you could please explain why those are
false positives I would appreciate it. (Especially in your patch
description).
If these are indeed false positives the patch looks ok.
