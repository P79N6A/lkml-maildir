That would be one of the nice aspects of a generic process container
abstraction linked to different resource controllers - you wouldn't
need to replicate the cpuset support, you could use it in parallel
with other resource controllers. (So e.g. use the cpusets support to
pin a group of processes on to a given set of CPU/memory nodes, and
then use the CKRM/RG CPU and disk/IO controllers to limit resource
usage within those nodes)
