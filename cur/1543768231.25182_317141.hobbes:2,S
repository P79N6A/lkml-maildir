Subject: [RFC][PATCH 2.4 0/4] inotify 0.22 2.4.x backport
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello
This are the patches for 2.4.x inotify 0.22 backport. While probably
there is no chance to have this included in vanilla 2.4.x I hope there
are interested people that can test it out. Any feedback is very
appreciated.
The modifications have been worked out on 2.4.27 (the kernel versions we
 need/use right now) and adapted for 2.4.30 to apply cleanly. We
performed our testing with usermode linux and UML (virtual) SMP feature.
While developing/working on it at some point we observed a "create file"
event not being generated for a new file. This only happened once and we
were unable to reproduce this so far. So be careful :)
Also because of the x86 only atomic_inc_return backport the codes
currently only compile for x86. It should be easy however to backport
those codes for other architectures.
The following patches will be:
- find_next_bit backport
- idr backport
- atomic_inc_return x86 backport
- inotify specific codes backport
