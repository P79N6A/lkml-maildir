All the inlines in this code are pretty pointless: all those functions have
a single callsite so the compiler inlines them anyway.  If we later add
more callsites for these functions, they're too big to be inlined.
inline is usually wrong: don't do it!

So we take the lock, look up an item, then drop the lock then return the
item we just found.  We took no refcount on it and we didn't do anything to
keep this object alive.
Is that a bug, or does the (afacit undocumented) lifecycle management of
these things take care of it in some manner?  If yes, please reply via an
add-a-comment patch.

Can this really be called with NULL?  If so, under what circumstances? 
(This reader couldn't work it out from a brief look at the code, so perhaps
others will not be able to either.  Perhaps a comment is needed)

Right, so I suspect what's happening here is that all iova's remain valid
until their entire domain is destroyed, yes?
What is the upper bound to the memory consumpotion here, and what provides
it?
Again, some code comments about these design issues are appropriate.

Am still wondering why we cannot use PAGE_SIZE, PAGE_SHIFT, etc here.

What determined that address?  (Needs comment)

So I'm looking at this and wondering "what type does addr have"?
If it's unsigned long then perhaps we have a problem on x86_32 PAE.  Maybe
we don't support x86_32 PAE, but still, I'd have thought that the
appropriate type here is dma_addr_t.
But alas, it was needlessly implemented as a macro, so the reader cannot
tell.
