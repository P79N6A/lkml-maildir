Yep.  I still laugh at those who say "bandwidth is free."  They've obviously
never bought anything from UUNet.  At any rate, a full DS3 (45mbps) will
run between 7k and 20k USD per _month_.  Last time I checked, kernel.org
didn't have the funds for 7k/year much less per month.
Server colocation is a far cheaper solution, but then they have the
same problems they have now... limited access to the hardware when something
goes wrong (and it always does.)
