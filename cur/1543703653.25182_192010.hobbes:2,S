Is that reproducable? The selftest code in slab noticed a change in a 
buffer that is not in use: All values should be 0x6b, but the first 4 
bytes are different.
Could you try to boot with CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC enabled? Perhaps that 
identifies who corrupts the page. Unfortunately it can't detect DMA writes.

put_page_testzero noticed that the page count was already 0. It seems 
that someone uses memory that was already freed.
