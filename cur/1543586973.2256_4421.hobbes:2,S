hi all
regently I see weird things with X.
XFree86 Version 4.0.2 / X Window System
(protocol Version 11, revision 0, vendor release 6400)
Release Date: 18 December 2000
(II) NV: driver for NVIDIA chipsets: RIVA128, RIVATNT, RIVATNT2,
        RIVATNT2 (Ultra), RIVATNT2 (Vanta), RIVATNT2 M64,
        RIVATNT2 (Integrated), GeForce 256, GeForce DDR, Quadro,
        GeForce2 GTS, GeForce2 GTS (rev 1), GeForce2 ultra, Quadro 2 Pro,
        GeForce2 MX, GeForce2 MX DDR, Quadro 2 MXR, GeForce 2 Go
(--) Chipset RIVATNT found
this is a SuSE 7.0 std X thing. no specific NVIDIA obfuscated source
binary or something.
what happens is that after some time, I switch back & forth from and to
X. sometimes, most within a day of work, switching from X to a VC, the
VC's blank. it reacts to commands but display is blank.
I don't have special modules launched and no patches to the kernel
except the lm_sensors / i2c stuff. removed it for test and still
happens.
someone an idea ?
