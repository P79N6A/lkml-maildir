I am having dma timeouts with my Maxtor 6Y120P0.  It is connected as the
slave on the primary channel of the nVidia nForce2 based Asus A7N8X DX.
I did not have this problem with 2.4.21.  On the 2.4.22-pre series, I
have encountered this problem in pre4, pre5, and pre6.  I did not try 
earlier pre's.  In the pre2 -> pre3 change log, there was a mention of 
fix ide dma timeout bugs.  I am wondering if this fix is causing my newly
experienced problems.
