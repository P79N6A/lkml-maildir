Ideally, you'd do an analysis first and then prioritize, based
on the severity of the bug, its exposure, how easy it is it fix,
etc.  If while doing that you already have a fix at hand, you're
almost done :)
Recursively, there's the problem of which bugs you analyze first.
I'm inclined to say that you want to analyze most if not all bug reports
in higher priority than working on fixing non-critical bug.
