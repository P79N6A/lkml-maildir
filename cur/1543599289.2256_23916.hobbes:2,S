You probably don't need to be doing oldconfig if you are doing
menuconfig and correctly filling everything out, although the correct
place to do it would be before menuconfig (let oldconfig prompt you on
new config options). thus,
`make oldconfig menuconfig dep clean bzImage'
is what you should do. if you are running `make dep', my theory is
wrong, and admittedly I don't know why it is not working for you.
