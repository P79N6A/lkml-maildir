Any decent guitar player who has used their computer as an effects unit
could tell you this.  I can easily perceive the difference between 1.3
and 2.6, and 2.6 and 5ms latencies.  And there's at least one person
(also a guitarist, who I have added to the cc:) who swears he cam
perceive the difference between 0.6 and 1.3ms.  Soundcard ADCs typically
add 1.5ms latency in each direction, so the actual floor seems to be
around 3-5ms.
