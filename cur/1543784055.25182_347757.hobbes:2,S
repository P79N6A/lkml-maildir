Hi, David. I think I have the same problem with a similar card, the SATA150
TX2plus. The sata_promise module sees the SATA ports, but not the PATA port.
Promise made up a driver called pdc-ultra (not based o ftlib.o) that worked with
2.4 kernels (I could see the PATA drive as a SCSI drive), but it spits back
"unresolved symbols" errors with 2.6. Promise is useless for tech support on
this.
Jeff Garzik says something on the libata website about a patch for preliminary
support of PATA on Promise SATA, but I haven't tried it out.
