       One size fits all fits an awful lot.
       In a paranoid case (you're running a multiuser machine and you
       know the world is out to get you, you certainly don't want new
       devices to spring into life singing "Yoo hoo, sailors! I'm
       Available!", so you set up the system to default new permissions
       to nobody can touch them.
       In a home-machine case (like a laptop) it's simpler to just give
       the world access to everything new that pops up.
       In the ultra-paranoid case, where you want to do fancy shuffling
       of permissions for every device under the sun, but you want new
       devices to populate themselves into /dev, you set up /dev in the
       traditional pentagram and candles method, open devfs as /devices
       (with major/minor number generation enabled), the write a little
       daemon that simply carries the major and minor numbers across
       into /dev.   De facto policy (unless you're much more dedicated
       at customising your system than I am, and I'm the person who's
       made an all a.out Linux distribution that uses BSD tools in
       preference to GNUware) means that your devices in /dev will be
       named in a consistant fashion, so the daemon will carry the
       majors and minors over via the device names, and when brand new
       devices are created, they'll be created in /dev with
       ultra-paranoia on, and you can hand- manipulate them at your
       leisure.
       The ultra-paranoid case is the scheme I was favoring when I was
       doing my hacking away at a devfs way back when;  I just wanted a
       /devices directory that could be used to properly populate /dev.
       But it didn't take too much reading to realize that Richard was
       doing it in a much better fashion than I was, so I dropped my
       horrible kludgery like a hot potato(e).

       Devfs breaks nothing.   It is not required that you mount a devfs
       on dev, and it is not required (unless Richard Gooch has pretty
       abruptly broken things) to not have major and minor numbers.
       It's a pretty major convenience to have a devfs mounted on /dev,
       but that's just a little something extra that comes on top of
       the utter bliss that is the kernel actually telling me what
       devices it knows about (in a fashion that standard tools can
       manipulate it.)
