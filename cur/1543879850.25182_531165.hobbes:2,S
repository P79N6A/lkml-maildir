I can't say that "Nvcsw" and "Nivcsw" is something less verbose as 
output above.
It is more usual  so it is more clear for you. But if you need this counters
you should know what are they and how to use them.
As for me "nonvoluntary_ctxt_switch" and "voluntary_ctxt_switch" is more 
verbose,
and it is not big deal to change names. But I think that information about
this counters and verbose name should be in user space tools, like ps.
