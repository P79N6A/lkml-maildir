Then change it to :
pci_enable_device(struct pci_dev *dev, struct pci_enable *enable_set)
typedef union {
	unsigned all	: 8;
	struct {
		unsigned bar0		: 1;
		unsigned bar1		: 1;
		unsigned bar2		: 1;
		unsigned bar3		: 1;
		unsigned bar4		: 1;
		unsigned bar5		: 1;
		unsigned reserved	: 2;
	} bar;
} pci_t;
struct pci_enable {
	pci_t		io_bars;
	pci_t		mem_bars;
...
	pci_t		wtf_bars;
...
	unsigned long	reg[6];
...
	(pick and add whatever gets the job done)
};
I am not picky, just want it simple so that It can be tabled out by device
classes.
