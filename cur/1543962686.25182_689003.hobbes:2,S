Kconfig is an interface for users.
From a developer perspective if might be the easiest to simply remove 
the "select" syntax, but from an UI perspective it would be horrible.

Why do we have to bother users with the MII option at all?
"E1000E=m and TULIP=m but MII=y" works, but it doesn't really make 
sense.
