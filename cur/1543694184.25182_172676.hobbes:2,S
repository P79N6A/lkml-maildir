hi Greg,
thanks for the reply.
i do reserve pci resources at boot time with kernel option as
"pci_hp_reserve=8,16,16" without quotes.
but still i am getting this problem.
is this problem coming because of mishandling of resources?
regards,
-Adarsh.

For 2.4, I think that Scott had a patch that would require the user to
reserve pci resources at boot time to solve this problem.
See the linux pci hotplug devel mailing list archives for the patch and
a description of how to get this to work on 2.4.
Hope this helps,
