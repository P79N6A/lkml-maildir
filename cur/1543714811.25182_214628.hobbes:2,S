My main interest in it is as a prerequisite for various methods of
"automatically" using hugepages for programs where it is difficult to
manually code them to use hugetlbfs.  In particular, think HPC
monsters written in FORTRAN.  e.g. automatically putting suitable
aligned anonymous mmap()s in hugepages under some circumstances (I
can't say I like that idea much), using an LD_PRELOAD to put
malloc()ated memory into hugepages, or using a hacked ELF loader to
put the BSS section (again, think FORTRAN) into hugepages (actually
easier and less ugly than it sounds).
In any of these cases having the memory have different semantics
(MAP_SHARED) to normal anonymous memory would clearly be a Bad Thing.
