I don't know of any Linux kernel that has ever been able to cope with PID1
dying.  I certainly remember facing the PID1 dying causing lockup as far
back as 1.3 kernels, and I even tried to fix it back then.  The argument
put forward for not fixing it is that PID1 should not exit.  Period.
The point here is not that the kernel itself can't cope with PID1 exiting,
but that the code _bypasses_ the protection put into the kernel against
PID1 exiting.
