Subject: Fib entries
Hi
	I have a question related to forwarding information base(FIB).
Depending upon destination IP address a packet can be 
a) for this machine
b) for a machine to which this machine is directly connected
c) for a machine to which this machine is not directly connected.
Does FIB contain the entries for delivery for all the 3 cases or only for
the third case
Thanks in advance for all the help
Manoj
