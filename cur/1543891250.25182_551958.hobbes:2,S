It has nothing to do with the struct device vs. class devices, you need
to think more carefully about the placement of the list_del().
My other concerns with this patch are that it exports incorrect
information on spitz (which I had warned about and I will get bug
reports about) and that "description" is not really a suitable name for
a sysfs attribute, "function" might give a better idea of what it
represents to developers.
I still question whether either colour or function properties are
actually particularly useful to userspace other than for naming purposes
which is why they were part of the device name.
Anyhow, I'm trying not to say too much more as it will just go in
circles. I'll await a reply from Greg.
Regards,
Richard
