Well I was going to do a few more tests and send a nice email doing just
that but in going through my package list with dpkg I spotted cpudyn and
cpufreqd installed. I've uninstalled them and now I cannot reproduce
the problem.
As such, and I hope I'm not speaking to you, it appears 'solved'. They
must've been interfering with the network layer somehow (or something)
and now that they are gone all's well.
My apologies if anyones time was wasted.
