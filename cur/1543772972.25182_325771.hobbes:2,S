I'm using the via-rhine module here, and it works just fine in both
2.6.12-rc6, 2.6.12-rc6-git6 and 2.6.12-rc6-mm1

If you are loading closed source vmware modules into your kernel and
then things stop working but they are fine without the modules loaded,
then yes, that's a problem between you and vmware - get in touch with
vmwares support.
If you can reproduce the problem *without* the vmware modules, then
it's an issue for LKML.
