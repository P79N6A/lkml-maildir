Hi there,
I've just tried the 2.6.13-mm1 kernel, and at the new boot i've noticed a strange stop in the init sequence.
Not a freeze, the system will shutdown with ctrl+alt+canc (even though it give a timeout on /dev/initctl).
After some tests i've figured out that the problem is in the init script /etc/init.d/makedev.
In fact if i run a "MAKEDEV something" in the /dev directory, i obtain the same problem.
When this happens, /proc/devices becomes also inacessible, and it's impossible to exec any other program that requires a new shell.
ps shows them ('MAKEDEV something' and 'cat /proc/devices') as D+.
It all works fine removing the makedev script from the init sequence, i use udev so it's not a problem at all.
Anyway, it should be good to figure out where's the problem, so, in the hoping that it will be useful, I enclose the config of my kernel and the kernel trace (the process is #2786).
Thank you.
Bye.
