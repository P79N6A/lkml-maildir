The first three patches in my set can go to -mm/mainline now, if it's ok w/
you.  I think this fs/ioctl.c cleanup is useful indepenent of unionfs.  The
3rd patch, making unionfs use vfs_ioctl, is a very small patch, and I can
wait on it until the first 3 patches are in Linus's tree (for now, I'll just
call the lower ->ioctl/unlocked_ioctl).

Sure.  I'd like to start with a re-review of the current code, since much
have changed.  I did promise Al a few weeks ago that I'll post the whole
thing against mainline.  But I'll also go dig up whatever old mail is there
for when we first posted the code.
Cheers,
Erez.
