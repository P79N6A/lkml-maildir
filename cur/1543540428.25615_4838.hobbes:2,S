I don't see that in the 2.4.0-test4 tree.  Any idea who will be doing
this, and when?

AFAICS, the pcmcia-cs `make install' target will look to see if you've
built your kernel with CONFIG_PCMCIA.  If you have, the pcmcia_cs
clients are not built.  So one approach would be to massage the pcmcia
config files at install time to refer to either 3c575_cb or to 3c59x.  
This doesn't feel right.
Another option is to use a new identifier altogether within the pcmcia
package (3com_nic) and then rely upon modprobe resolving it
appropriately, either via an if/then test or
	probe 3com_nic  3c575_cb 3c59x
in modules.conf.
Third option: globally replace 3c575_cb with 3c59x in the pcmcia_cs
package.
Any preferences?
