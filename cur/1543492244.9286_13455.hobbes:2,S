It seems that when binding multiple IPs to an interface,
a packet's source address will be set to the lowest-numbered
IP alias rather than the IP of the primary interface.
i.e. if eth0 is 192.168.1.55, eth0:1 is 192.168.1.44, and eth0:2 is
192.168.1.66, all packets will originate from 192.168.1.44.
