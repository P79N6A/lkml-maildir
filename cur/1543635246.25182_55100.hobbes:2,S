Hi,
  There's a new NFS_ALL package full of NFS client updates out for 2.4.19-rc1.
New features include:
  - UDP message round trip timing in order to improve the timeout + resend 
cycle.
  - UDP congestion control as per Van Jacobson.
  - Further improvements to the close-to-open code
  - Full support for the NFSv3 ACCESS function (as required by people who want 
to use ACLs).
A full description of all the components and features can be found in the file
   
http://www.fys.uio.no/~trondmy/src/2.4.19-rc1/HEADER.html
the patch itself can be found as
  
http://www.fys.uio.no/~trondmy/src/2.4.19-rc1/linux-2.4.19-NFS_ALL.dif
For those who have been following the contents of these files, please note 
that a lot of changes have been made w.r.t. the 2.4.18 version:
Amongst other things, the 'ping' patch (see 
http://www.fys.uio.no/~trondmy/src/2.4.18/HEADER.html
) is assumed to be 
replaced by the new and improved RPC round trip timing+congestion avoidance 
code.
The DIRECTIO patch has been removed pending a decision by Chuck on whether or 
not he wants to continue supporting it?
Happy testing,
  Trond
