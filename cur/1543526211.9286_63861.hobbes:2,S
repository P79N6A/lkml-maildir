I don't really agree with that.  The wide deployment of computers was
largely driven by lowering prices.  From that point of view the way that
the PC evolution just makes sense.  Development just isn't as straight as
everbody would like it to be.

Think about how you can combine some the best things of the mainframe world
with the best of other operating systems.  And you will end up with something
that looks like Linux on a mainframe.  IBM isn't just playing.  I bet
they've got a plan in their pocket.
