Andi,
The comment in mm/mempolicy.c for alloc_page_vma() states:
  Should be called with the mm_sem of the vma hold.
However it seems that the call chain (#ifdef CONFIG_NUMA):
  shmem_getpage ==> shmem_alloc_page ==> alloc_page_vma
where shmem_getpage() is called from many of the mm/shmem.c file
operations, is called without holding mmap_sem.  There is no
mention of mmap_sem in the entire mm/shmem.c file.
This doesn't seem right.
