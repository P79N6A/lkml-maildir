Ok, new results.
Built a new virgin 2.6.16.
1) able to stimulate a tx time out message
2) rebooted with 3c59x.global_enable_wol=0 on command line,
   able to stimulate a tx time out message
Applied the collision statistics fix fix. Changed the extraversion
in the top Makefile to preserve my baseline, also make does more
work than previous.
