Ok this looks good.  But it raises a couple of followup questions.
- Are there other places that use hard_smp_processor_id in 
  in a uniprocessor kernel?
- Does x86_64 have this same problem?
Anyway it looks like we have this working which is a big step forward
in having a reliable kdump mechanism.
