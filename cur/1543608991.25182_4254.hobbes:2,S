Do you have ext3 compiled into the kernel?  I suspect you have it as a module.
Also, given the large number of similar bug reports, maybe RedHat has a bug in
their mkinitrd script which doesn't try to mount the root fs with ext3?  I
don't know enough about their mkinitrd tools to say - Alan, Stephen?
