Ok, if I understand properly, all we have to do on PPC is to implement a
pci_request_legacy_resource() that will do the right thing for legacy
VGA memory as well ?
Then, please, check the return value of pci_request_legacy_resource()
for getting to the VGA memory. Some machines (typically PowerMacs)
simply don't give you a way to generate PCI cycles to those low memory
addresses (you can't do VGA on those).
Disabling VGA dynamically depending on the machine have been a real pain
until now. With that change, it will now just be a matter for our PPC
implementation of pci_request_legacy_resource() to fail on machines
where VGA memory can't be reached.
Ben.
