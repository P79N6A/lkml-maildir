I was looking through the memory overcommit code, and noticed that page
cache size
and swap size are being taken for granted if system needs to reclaim
memory either
paging to disk or swap. But in reality if VMAs are locked that
assumption is broken,
(for anon and file backed pgs) success maybe returned even though memory
request 
can't be met. Is that a known fact?
