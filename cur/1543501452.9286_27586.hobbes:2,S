Introducing default files will break fstat(2).

Interesting to note how stupid grep really is:
open("acpi", O_RDONLY)             = 4
fstat(4, {st_mode=S_IFDIR|0775, st_size=1024, ...}) = 0
read(4, 0x8060000, 32768)               = -1 EISDIR (Is a directory)
[lstat() returns file, file is exchanged by a directory until the open()
happens]

A real problem, however, is that fstat() does not allow you to check
whether you just opened a link. Maybe a solution would be to add an
O_NOLINK flag that makes open refuse to open a symlink (that is not root
owned?)?
