Neither in 2.2.0 nor in 2.2.1. Use 2.0.37 :-))

No. Problems with 8-16Mb could be resolved (and I hope will be resolved -- may
be some 2.2.x will work with 8Mb even better then 2.0.x -- wild dream, I know)
but 4Mb is "no way". The whole design of a lot of subsystems was changed and
thus there are no chances to get "normal" work on 4Mb systems.
