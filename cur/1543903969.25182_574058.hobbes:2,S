Not at all.  The kernel changed things numerous times that showed up as
bugs in udev, and I fully admit that (and have in the past, numerous
times.)

Um, the same way you change any codebase?  :)

That's great, and I have nothing against that, and encourage you to do
so.
But I don't suppose you are trying to complain to the ACPI developers
about this whole thing now are you?  Are you hasseling them and
demanding that they fully document their interfaces that you need to use
so that you can hook into their code differently than they wish you to
do so?

The firmware layer has never been fully documented, and the maintainer
of the code died a few years ago.  It has been well known that this is
one area of the kernel that needs a lot of attention and help.  Please
feel free to chip in if you can do so.

I fully agree.

Ir proably is, hence my suggestion on something that would be very
valuable to have documented.

Huh, I never stated that at all.  If you wish to fully document sysfs
and how it works, then great, do that.  But that was not the stated
intent of this document, and is why I think the author got confused as
he was attempting to put a narrow portion of how sysfs works as a
reflection on how the whole of the body works.
