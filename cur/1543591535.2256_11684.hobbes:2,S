Netfilter is going to stay. Rusty knew from early on in ipchains development
that the whole concept was wrong, but Alan told him to continue on, get it
into 2.2, and then do a new one for 2.4. There's a document detailing this
somewhere, I just can't forget where.

This is entirely incorrect and FUD. If enable Netfilter, look in the
Netfilter options, disable conntrack and IP tables support, you have
(*gasp!*) ipchains compatability, as well as (*ohmygod!*) ipfwadm
compatability.

The FUD has to be corrected.
