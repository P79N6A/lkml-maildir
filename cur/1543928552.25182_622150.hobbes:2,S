As Cornelia said, it would be worthwhile mentioning krefs in this
document as well.  They are simple enough to explain, after all.

kobject_init() isn't mandatory if you use kobject_register().  But then

In fact kset, ktype, and parent are optional, right?  You might mention
at this point that not all those fields are needed, and explain later
which combinations are legal.

It's worth mentioning here (and perhaps elsewhere too) that all of the
function calls described here can sleep and hence must be made in
process context, with the exception of the *_get() routines.  It's
possible to call *_put() in atomic context; the SCSI core does this
(with device_put, not kobject_put) and has to jump through hoops to run
the corresponding release routine in a waitqueue task.  In general,
though, it isn't safe.

Why not?  What's wrong with static kobjects?  I've never understood this.

Not to mention that doing this will leak memory.  Unless the kobject
is static...

Actually the current code doesn't seem to check whether kobj->ktype is
NULL or to use the value of kobj->kset->kobj.ktype.  Is this an oversight?

That's where a kobject shows up if its parent field isn't set when
kobject_add() is called.  But if the parent field _is_ set, does
anything (such as a symbolic link) show up in the kset's directory?

"almost all" isn't right.  "In some cases" would be more realistic.

There's no need to mention this here.  Not only is it wrong, more
importantly users of kobjects never have to initialize the refcount.

If there is no containing kset, the parent remains NULL.  What happens
then?  Does the kobject show up in the sysfs top-level directory?

There are no checks for this!  At least, not until the cleanup occurs.
Here's a question for you: The code in kobject.c is full of odd things
like this (from the start of kobject_add):
	if (!(kobj = kobject_get(kobj)))
		return -ENOENT;
What's the point of the assignment?  We know that kobject_get() always
returns its argument.  This sort of thing happens all over the place.
