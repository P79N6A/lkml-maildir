according to the chapter "Linux Kernel Overview" of the
kernelhacking-HOWTO the page cache holds pages associated with *open*
files:
The Page Cache
The page cache is made up of pages, each of which refers to a 4kB
portion of data associated with an open file. The data contained in a
page may come from several disk blocks, which may or may not be
physically neighbours on the disk. The page cache is largely used to
interface the requirements of the memory management subsystem (which
uses fixed, 4kB pages) to the VFS subsystem (which uses different size
blocks for different devices).
The page cache has two important data structures, a page hash table
and an inode queue. The page hash table is used to quickly find the
page descriptor of the page holding data associated with an inode and
offset within a file. The inode queue contains lists of page
descriptors relating to open files.

               For to be free is not merely to cast off
               one's chains, but to live in a way that
              respects and enhances the freedom of others
