Hi All,
I am trying to port a driver from x86 PCI based platform to ARM platform.
The x86 driver has scatter-gather list as one of the DMA mechanism.
Can I bypass this, As I believe sg list is for PCI buses and not for HSX buses.
Can any one give me the _source_ where I can understand the necessity for
a PCI bus to use sg list.
Regards,
deven
