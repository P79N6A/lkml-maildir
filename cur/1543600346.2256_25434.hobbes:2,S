I've just tried all -ac1 kernels from 2.4.5-ac1 to 2.4.9-ac1
and the problem exists with all of them. So it would appear that
it didn't work reliably with earlier kernels either. I find it
interesting however, that it is much harder to trigger in
earlier kernels and that it doesn't happen every time.
