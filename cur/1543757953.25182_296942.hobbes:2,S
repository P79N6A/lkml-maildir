Yes, that was my thinking.

Yesterday shattered in various directions, I hope to try today.

Of course, that does allow some simplifications in your for_each
macros; but it still looked like my p??_limits were better for
shortest codepath, and close to yours for codesize.

I'll take a quick look at David's today.
Just so long as we don't make them harder.

Oh, okay, thanks.  You weren't very happy with p??_limit(addr, end),
and good naming is important to me.  I didn't care for your tentative
p??_span or p??_span_end.  Would p??_end be better?  p??_enda would
be fun for one of them...
