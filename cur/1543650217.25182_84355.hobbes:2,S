That's not information hiding - there were 3 different locking 
implementations: first one with a per-queue spinlock that didn't support 
growing the number of queues at runtime, then one with a global rw lock 
and a per-queue spinlock, and the simple, global spinlock version that's 
part of 2.3.x-2.5.4x.

Which deadlock did you see? With the RCU ipc patch [part of 2.5.44-mm6], 
msg_lock again locks the queue, not the whole array. Calls to 
ipc_addid() with the msq spinlock aquired are not permitted.
