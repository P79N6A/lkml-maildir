Sounds to me you are causing the ISA bus to smoke... An ISA bus can only 
handle at most 16 MB / s but this is a pure theoretical limit, 8 MB / s is a 
more sane value. And when the SCSI controller fills the buffer of the disk it 
is damn good possible your ISA bus is flooded with data for about 1/8 sec.. 
this shouldn't happen, but iMHO you should use a PCI SCSI controller if you do 
"massive access" to disks...
