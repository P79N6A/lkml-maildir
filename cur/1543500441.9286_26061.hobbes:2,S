That is the whole point: filesystem support for multi-forked data
(mostly a performance issue) while supporting the highly desireable
view of documents being files.

One must be able to "rm" or "mv" the whole document with any old
tool. That really ought to include old statically linked tools.
Don't bother with ugly hacks for each individual issue. Suggest a
solution that _cleanly_ covers the whole thing if you can. I'll
expect to _not_ see "magic" file names in directories. I'll also
expect something that the NTFS driver can use.
