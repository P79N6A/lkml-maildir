Respectfully ignoring this until he can comment.  I suspect he made a

Even if A is doing A/V work and B is programming?

I see.  My instinct is to charge A if B just caused a sync, but change B
if B was automagically forcing A to do something...
But I still don't understand the layers involved well enough.

To be even more fair, but possibly launch another flame, Reiser4
reserves 5% of disk space by default to avoid this kind of thing.  But
that's talking about total disk, not quotas.
Also doesn't answer my question, but it seems I'm starting to get it.
How do we get over quota errors, btw?  Can we get them from write()
calls?  If so, I don't see a Problem(TM), just an annoyance.
