You still need to use cardmgr to bind the driver to the device.
It seems to work for me here on SA11x0 platforms, and I'm not aware
of it breaking at any point in the 2.5 series.
While it is true that Cardbus devices plugged into cardbus slots do
not need cardmgr, PCMCIA devices still do.

IIRC hermes provides the low level interface to the device, orinoco
provides the interface between it and the network stack, and orinoco_cs
provides a bridge between the PCMCIA subsystem and orinoco.
