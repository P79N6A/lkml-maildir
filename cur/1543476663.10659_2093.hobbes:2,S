According to Jes Sorensen:

I agree with your analysis.  I'm now running with the below patch.
(I decided to look into this because I use mutt.  :-))
Index: fs/select.c
*************** asmlinkage int sys_poll(struct pollfd * 
*** 335,339 ****
  		timeout = MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT;
  	else if (timeout)
! 		timeout = (timeout*HZ+999)/1000+1;
  
  	err = -ENOMEM;
--- 335,339 ----
  		timeout = MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT;
  	else if (timeout)
! 		timeout = ROUND_UP(timeout, 1000/HZ);
  
  	err = -ENOMEM;
