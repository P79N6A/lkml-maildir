Well, it does use hashes :)
        hash = sctp_assoc_hashfn(ep->base.bind_addr.port, rport);
        head = &sctp_assoc_hashtable[hash];
        read_lock(&head->lock);
        sctp_for_each_hentry(epb, node, &head->chain) {
            /* maybe your machine is traversing here a *really* long 
chain */
            }
