	To all which may be interested,
	I'm getting loads of e-mail (daily) about the Linux drivers for
the CMI8338 soundchip. Please consider this URL for further details.
http://www.cmedia.com.tw
	The howto included in the kernel source covers only the ISA
CMI8330 soundchip so please don't e-mail me about the other one.
Sorry if this was off-topic but I want to reduce by 50% my daily mailbombing :)
