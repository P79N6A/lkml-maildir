AHA-29160 is Adaptec's product name for the board
AIC-7892 (AIC=Adaptec Integrated Circuit, presumably) is the name of the
         scsi *chip* that is on your AHA29160 board.
A particular type of chip can be on multiple types of boards, hence most
(all?) linux drivers identify by chips rather than by manuf. product names.
(See tulip driver for all of the various boards DEC/Kingston/NetGear/etc
that are built with various types of DEC/Intel/etc "tulip-chipset" 21x4x, and
so on...)

                           ^^^^^^^^^^^
It appears the 7892 does drive ultra160 boards.  So its prob a AHA BIOS
setup issue, the drives are not negotiating correctly (not u160?), or
its just a driver issue with the linux driver (adaptec have till very recently
been largely unhelpful in the development of any linux driver.  Get a symbios
board, for example, if you want to support people who have helped linux
driver developers and gotten a good driver for their card out of it.)
