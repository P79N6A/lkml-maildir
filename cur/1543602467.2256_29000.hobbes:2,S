This is heavily dependant on the interrupt mitigation features that a card  
has.  At least for the ns83820 driver, I'm testing a technique where the 
driver essentially switches to polled mode once the interrupt load goes 
above a certain threshold, thereby limiting the load to ~2500 irq/sec.  
Combined with carefully placed data prefetching, I'm seeing a huge increase 
in performance.  Of course, this comes at the expense of latency.
