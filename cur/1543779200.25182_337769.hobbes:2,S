Not a problem.
The thing is, this is trivially solved by
 - disable irq controller last on shutdown
 - re-enable irq controller last on resume
Think about it. Even if you have screaming irq's (and thus we'll shut
things down somewhere during the resume), when we then get to re-enable
the irq controller thing, we'll have them all back again at that point.
Problem solved.
You can have variations on this, of course - you can enable the irq
controller early _and_ late in the resume process. Ie do a minimal "get
the basics working" early - you might want to make sure that timers etc
work early on, for example, and then a "fix up the details" thing late.
An interrupt controller is clearly a special case, so it's worth spending 
some effort on handling it.
In contrast, what is _not_ worth doing is screweing over every single
driver we have.
