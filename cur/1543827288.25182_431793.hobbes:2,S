You missed my point (or I didn't make it clear enough):
It's no question that an improved version of ext3 will be available.
The only question is whether it will be ext3 or ext4.
My point was that if it takes a bit longer in the ext4 case, and during 
this time some people have this pressure of requiring it, they have the 
workaround of using other file systems.
Whether the "improve ext3" or the ext4 approach are better is a 
different question. Whether ext3 is better than XFS is also not what I 
was talking about.
It's simply that for the few people who need it now, other file systems 
are available as a workaround.
