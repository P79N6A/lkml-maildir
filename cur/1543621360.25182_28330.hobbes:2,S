Yes GNOME works in 2.4.17... in 2.5.5-pre1 it works two but I have some problems...

They don't disappear but I can't reproduce the behaviour anymore...
I've run reiserfsck --fix-fixable, it detects one error, fixes that and after reboot the files were gone in 2.4.17 AND 2.5.5-pre1
So the problem seems to be solved
Now I have another problem... If I start the gnome-terminal 9 of 10 times it hangs and bash doesn't start
I had this behaviour before the reiserfscks but I thought it has something to do with the files
2.4.17, again, runs without any problems
Maybe somebody can test if he can start gnome-terminal with 2.5.5-pre1
