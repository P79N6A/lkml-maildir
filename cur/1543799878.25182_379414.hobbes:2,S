what is the effect on text size? Could you post the before- and 
after-patch vmlinux 'size kernel/test.o' output in the nondebug case, 
with Arjan's latest 'convert a couple of semaphore users to mutexes' 
patch applied? [make sure you've got enough of those users compiled in, 
so that the inlining cost is truly measured. Perhaps also do 
before/after 'size' output of a few affected .o files, without mixing 
kernel/mutex.o into it, like vmlinux does.]
