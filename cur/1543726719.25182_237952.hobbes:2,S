Ok, you convinced me that a thin layer would give something. However, I
still think it would be better to use the lists that are already present in
class core, and not create new lists that duplicate the main one. First, the
main list is the 'ultimate' source of information, second list could
occasionally get out of sync.

Well, *if* class_match will be implemented, it will become a part of class
core. So there shouldn't be a problem with manipulating that list.

You did a perfect summary of the problem. Greg, what's your answer?
