I was not thinking of them at the time, however dev_dbg is not an option
because we do not have a struct device at hand when we want to print
some debugging lines.
pr_debug might work, but I would rather have file and line already
there.
Though, admittedly, that would be a better argument if it used __FILE__
there instead of hard coding it.
In any case, I don't think any of the debug prints will have to stick
around that much longer.

Added.
(Along with associated changes so that it's kept const everywhere.)

It looks like psmouse handles it with a mutex lock around freeing stuff
and calling the callback function pointers we set on init, so we
_should_ be safe unless I've missed something.
Add to it that none of the other psmouse drivers are doing locking on
their own, and I'm fairly sure that this is correct. (But if someone
knows better, please correct me.)
Thank you.
