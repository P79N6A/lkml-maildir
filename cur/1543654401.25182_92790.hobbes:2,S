The culprit turned out to be an inherited CONFIG_NFS_DIRECTIO
setting.  Having the client kernel (2.4.20rc2aa1) this option
turned off, performance is stable 4 MB/sec (server hasn't
changed).  This is almost twice as good as with 2.4.19-rmap14b.
I understand the CONFIG_NFS_DIRECTIO warning in Configure.help,
but why does it affect 1) client performance and 2) shouldn't it
only matter for files opened with open(..., O_DIRECT)?

No, for various administrative reasons.
