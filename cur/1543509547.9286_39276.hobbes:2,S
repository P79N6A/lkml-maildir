I'm obviously missing something but it looks like sock_wake_async
always queues/sends a signal if SO_WAITDATA isn't set and that is
only set if something blocks on the socket. Event driven code
wouldn't be blocking on the socket. Then looking at the tcp code
it seems to call wake_async for each packet. This is fine for
a traditional SIGIO but with queued signals you have a situation
where increasing load causes a needless increase in overhead.
