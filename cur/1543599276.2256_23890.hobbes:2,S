ahhh I think I got it. nevermind the bit about CONFIG_PREEMPT not being
set, that is not it (as I am sure you all know).
The problem is that dec_and_lock.c is not being compiled (or at least
the object isnt being included).  I believe this is caused by having bad
dependencies.  My .depend has a dependency to compile the object -- I
wager your's does not.
So... did you rerun `make dep' ?
If not, try a fresh kernel tree and make sure to do `make oldconfig dep
clean' after patching.
Please let me know because I am trying to track this down, and I don't
have it happening to me.  I think this should do it.
Of note, I will release a patch against 2.4.9-ac2 and 2.4.10-pre1 soon.
