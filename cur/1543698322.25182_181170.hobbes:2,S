Ok, we'll avoid discussing a major point in XFS's life -- potentially
being merged into 2.4 -- on XFS list.  Makes sense.

This is bogus logic.
Nobody is forcing 2.6 on anyone.  People who wish to use XFS in 2.4
_can do so today_...  without any merging from Marcelo.
Merging is nothing more than moving a patch from one place to another.

This is bogus logic.
It's _very_ wise to hold off on a patch if
(a) the code is difficult to read, and therefore difficult to review and
    fix (read: style)
(b) the maintainer is not assured of patch reliability (read: "I'm not
    sure the patch won't break things")
Both (a) and (b) are vaild concerns for long term maintenance costs.
Particularly (b).  If Marcelo is not assured of patch reliability, then
he absolutely --should not-- merge XFS into 2.4.  That's just the way
the system works.  And it's a good system.
