Yes, that would be nice.
It will mean quite a bit of work, but I guess it should be the long
term goal. Loading restore kernel directly from bootloader means:
1) it is fast -- no need to boot another kernel
2) it is "classical" way of doing things
On the other hand, we loose flexibility that way:
1) it locks you onto one bootloader
2) you no longer have userland there to do uncompression, decryption,
etc..
