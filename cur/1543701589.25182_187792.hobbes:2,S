Ok. So far I have not had anyone requesting for 64 bit Linux OS HBA 
support. However I'm getting more request for 2.6 32 bit support as they 
are starting development with it. Might be different in your part of world.
I'm not a programmer myself so I'm not sure how involved it would be to 
tidy the driver up. If it's only a couple of additional lines than it can 
be address at the same time. But if that's not the case than I think 
Adaptec should tidy up the 32 bit support before working on 64 bit support. 
Last I want to see is a complete buggy driver release due to a complete 
rewrite of the driver for 32 and 64 bit support.
