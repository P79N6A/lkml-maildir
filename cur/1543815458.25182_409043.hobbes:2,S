Subject: [PATCH 38/46] kbuild: in makefile.txt note that Makefile is preferred name for kbuild files
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/3/21/250

As noted by Roland Dreier <rdreier@cisco.com> makefiles.txt told
one to use the name 'Kbuild' as preferred name for kbuild files.
This is not yet true so let makefiles.txt reflect reality.
