Apparently this information isn't needed.  It's very easy to verify:
$ ls /sys/devices/system/cpu/*/online
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online  /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu2/online
 /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu3/online
This is a quad core machine and cpu0 doesn't have the 'online' file
(2.6.19 kernel).  So, if nobody noticed this it's not needed and we can
just remove CPUs from /sys/devices/system/cpu when they are brought
offline, right?
