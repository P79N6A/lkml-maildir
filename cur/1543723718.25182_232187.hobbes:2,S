I recall text fragments like
 "Any device claiming compliance to ATA-3 or later as indicated in
  IDENTIFY DEVICE or IDENTIFY PACKET DEVICE data should properly
  release PDIAG- after a power-on or hardware reset upon receiving
  the first command or after 31 seconds have elapsed since the reset,
  whichever comes first."
that seem to imply that probing a nonexistent device may take 31 sec
before one is allowed to conclude that there is nothing there.
