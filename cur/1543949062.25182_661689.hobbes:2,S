page->end was introduced to have a unique pointer for each slab. The 
counter that you introduces can take over that role. So we could use a 
NULL pointer again as the end of the objects? Or some constant?
I am going to revert the change that introduced page->end for 2.6.25 since 
it seems that the new fastpath does not need this. It was specific to the 
old fastpath.
