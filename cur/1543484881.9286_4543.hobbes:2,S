Asking that is like asking if the parallel port driver provides
network printing services.

1600x1200x32x30 = 1.8 Gb/s = 2 point-to-point gigabit Ethernets
Gee, that sounds like a great way to spend your money.
I'd like to see the beefy server that handles multiple clients.
Hint: local CPU power is cheaper because you don't have to pay
the premium of high-end server CPUs like the latest Xeon or 21264.
Ethernet was not designed to be a point-to-point graphics bus.

I'm sick of this paranoid fear. Games written to the GGI API will
run in X just fine, assuming X can provide the needed performance.
