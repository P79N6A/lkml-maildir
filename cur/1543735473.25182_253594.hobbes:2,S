Yes. And it is indeed the Conexant modem seen by Windows.

Ok, I found the reason of the latter failure: in 2.6.7 I have 
ISA-PnP enabled (not in 2.6.5) and this loads the parport 
driver before the sound driver. parport steals the IRQ.
Module loading order is important: if I load the i8x0 sound 
modules first, the messages are more or less the same as the 
ones in 2.6.5 (including the "MC'97 1 converters and GPIO not 
ready" message), and then parport accepts IRQ 7 to be taken by 
resorting to polled operation:

I wonder what this means, and if something can be done about it 
(like: can the i8x0 sound modules use some other IRQ?)

I will. Do you have any idea on the "not ready" issue?
