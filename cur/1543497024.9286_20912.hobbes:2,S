Here is my /etc/issue file.  It's just the word Linux drawn with ascii
characters.  IMHO, it works pretty well on an 80x25 terminal screen.
If you like, feel free to use, modify, or share it.  
If you want to flame me for posting this in linux-kernel, please do so in
private e-mail.  I will take the blame for one off-topic post, but I do not
want to be responsible for any follow-up noise.
Thanks,
Phil Garcia
