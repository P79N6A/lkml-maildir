so?
A user can stick an USB memory card with _any_ malformed fs data and
make troubles via the automounter or user mounts. Yes, mount might do
some more checks but it sure won't do an fsck.
The user gets what he deserves when sticking crap in an USB port.
And that doesn't mean that the kernel should accept any fs image
when a user tries to cd into the file.
