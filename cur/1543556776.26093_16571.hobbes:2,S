Some more details:
I added the following code to put_last_free(bh) in buffer.c:
--- buffer.c.orig	Wed Dec  6 17:19:57 2000
+++ buffer.c	Thu Dec  7 19:55:39 2000
@@ -500,6 +500,11 @@
 	struct bh_free_head *head = &free_list[BUFSIZE_INDEX(bh->b_size)];
 	struct buffer_head **bhp = &head->list;
 
+	if(bh->b_page && Page_Uptodate(bh->b_page)
+			&& bh->b_page->mapping) { // XXX ???
+		BUG();
+	}
+
 	bh->b_state = 0;
 
 	spin_lock(&head->lock);
That is, if I want to put a buffer to the free list, I check if it is 
mapped and uptodate. If I understand the memory management correctly, this
is a Bad Thing and should not happen. But guess what? It does, in
invalidate_buffers. 
I think invalidate_buffers should check if the buffer belongs to a 
mapped page, and if it does, invalidate this mapping.
