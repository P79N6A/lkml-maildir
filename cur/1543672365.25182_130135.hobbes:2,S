Which were?
My reasons for this patch:
- Even if x86 is not the only platform that uses MSDOS partitions,
this should be a positive list, not a negative list. Else every new
platform has to explicitly express, *not* to use MSDOS partitions.
Seems awkward.
- Any platform needing MSDOS partitions but not explicitly listed can
still turn that option on through the advanced partitioning.
Currently, allnoconfig gives you MSDOS partitioning, which is not very
intuitive.
