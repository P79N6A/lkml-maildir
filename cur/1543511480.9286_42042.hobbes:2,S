Several people (including Stephen quoted above) have suggested that
this looks like a hardware issue.  Since I've run memtest86
extensively with no errors, I'm inclined to believe that it's *not* a
memory problem.
My question then becomes: What hardware problem *would* you look for,
though.  Like I said, memtest86 runs for hours on end w/o reporting a
single error...  /usr is on an EIDE 7200rpm 8.1G Seagate Medalist Pro
(ST39140A, 8693MB w/448kB Cache, CHS=1108/255/63).  Do you think it
could be my IDE cable or something similar?  HD problem?  Where would
you start?
Thanks.
