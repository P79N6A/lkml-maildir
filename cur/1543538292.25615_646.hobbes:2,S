Subject: Werror compiler option problems with modules and devfs

I've noticed that in the last few patches to 2.4.0-test3 (pre3 and
pre4), Werror is included in the CFLAGS. Unfortunately, this seems to
cause a problem when compiling modules as some of the functions are
never used, generating a warning which is considered an error. Also, it
complains that fs/devfs/base.c at line 2363 there is an "initialization
from incompatible pointer type". This would normally be a warning, but
it is treated as an error. It's rather easy to remove Werror from CFLAGS
in the Makefile, but I've included a patch below anyway.
I understand that using Werror probably helps enforce cleaner code, but
it definately does not work with modules. Also, I tried to figure out
how to fix the warning with devfs, but I was unable to. Other than that,
the kernel compiled without any warnings.
