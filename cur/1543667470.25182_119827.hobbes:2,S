Hi,
I've been running 2.5.x on my desktop the last months. It's working
great! But I had one issue with 2.4.x that 2.5.x hasn't solved. I can't
the the usb-keyboard working right.
I have an usb-printer, usb-scanner, usb-bluetooth and usb-serial, all of
them working like a charm. When I plug in the keyboard when my computer
is running, it works allright. (When I have booted with PS/2). But if I
boot with the keyboard inserted, I get the message "device not accepting
address". I have seen the faq on linux-usb.org, but I'm not able to boot
the pc without the noapic option.
The motherboard is a Asus CUV266-DLS dual P3 with integrated SCSI and
LAN. 
Anyone know what the problem is, or what I should try? It's kinda weird
that it works without hassle if I plug in it when running, but it won't
work when booting. Hmm.
Best regards,
Stian
