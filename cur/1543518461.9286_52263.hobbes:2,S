Ah, excellent. Now I am completely happy.
So, you have been bitten by the buggy code in ide_xlate_1024().
Giving boot parameters, as I said a moment ago, should help.
The culprit is the fragment of code
        if (drive->id) {
                drive->cyl  = drive->id->cyls;
                drive->head = drive->id->heads;
                drive->sect = drive->id->sectors;
        }
Let me check the kernel situation.
2.3.* is OK - I removed this fragment in patch 2.3.21.
2.2.* and 2.0.* are not OK.
I'll send Alan a patch to delete this also in 2.2.
