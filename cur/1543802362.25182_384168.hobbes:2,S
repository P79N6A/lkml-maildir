Can you please try this version?  It tries harder to correct any 
imbalance... hopefully not too hard.  In case you didn't notice, you need 
to let your exploits run for a bit before the throttling will take 
effect.  I intentionally start tasks off at 0 cpu usage, so it takes a bit 
to come up to it's real usage.
