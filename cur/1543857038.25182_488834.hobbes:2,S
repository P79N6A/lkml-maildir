Hello,
I'm interested in kevents and related things. I think it isn't a bad 
idea to incorporate more event kinds into the kevent implementation. Namely:
- processes (exitting/stopping/tracing)
- threads (ditto)
- futexes (for mutexes, semaphores and conditional variables)
- special communication events (such as on modem lines - see 
ioctl(TIOCMIWAIT,...))
- whatever can be found useful
Please consider this idea. Such solution may be useful for developers of 
large and complex applications. Thanks.
Regards,
Lukas Jelinek
