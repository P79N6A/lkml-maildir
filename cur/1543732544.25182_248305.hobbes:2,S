  Actually. Doesn't matter if it is in kernel or not for the users as
  long as it works.
  The problem is that I do not see either Gnome or KDE to ever get
  along to form one standard that everyone will use. Their libraries
  are huge and memory hogging which so many Linux users just do not
  like. What if a user doesn't want KDE or Gnome? Would all files
  created with either be broken?
  I doubt that something like file streams and meta-data can
  successfully be implemented purely in user-space and get the same
  support (ie be used by many programs) if this change doesn't come
  from the kernel. I just do not see it happen.
