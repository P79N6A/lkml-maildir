I tried it and it didn't work. The qc:s never got completed, so
they timed out and the ports got disabled.
Calling pdc_host_intr() instead, which calls ata_qc_complete(),
did work (see hack below). However, this means that pdc_interrupt()
should ignore ATA_TFLAG_POLLING, which seems strange and unsafe.
I'm just guessing here, but maybe pdc_interrupt()'s clearing of
PDC_INT_SEQMASK also affects whatever legacy ATA status bit libata
is polling to detect completion of the qc?

SETXFER is special: Promise chips snoop the commands and automatically
update internal timing registers when they see XFER MODE changes. They
may be hardwired to raise interrupts after these commands.
