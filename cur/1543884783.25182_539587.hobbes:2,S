Nah. I did a walkthrough once, and my discoveries were that
iso-8859-{2 .. 14} was a real minority if not nonexistant,
leaving you with almost obvious choices to guess what a file's
encoding is. If a name looks good, it must be UTF8 already.
Else try ISO-8859-1. If it still looks odd -- perhaps because
it's a weirdo character like "1/2" or it "does not sound right",
try cp437. etc.
