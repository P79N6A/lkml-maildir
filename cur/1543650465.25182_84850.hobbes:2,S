I think it's worth referencing e2compr here also,
which is a patch that provides transparent compression
for ext2 (& ext3?). Denis RICHARD (CC'd) is maintaining
the 2.4 implementation. I've version 0.4.42 (against
2.4.16) mirrored here:
http://www.iol.ie/~padraiga/patches/e2compr-0.4.42-patch-2.4.16.gz
Note I've used it without problems (to access filesystems
created with the kernel 2.2 version) here:
