You know, there is a LOT of instructions like that.  x86 has a single
instruction to do:
	a = b + (c << 3) + 3600;
(Assuming a, b and c are in eax, ebx, and ecx, respecively, the
instruction is "leal 3600(%ebx,%ecx,3),%eax".)
The C compiler really needs to recognize these kinds of idioms, not
just in the source, but that occur natually as a result of code
generation and optimizations.  The compiler lingo for this is
"peephole optimization."
