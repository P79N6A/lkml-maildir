Hmm .. so you are saying that this is a HARDWARE limitiation ?
How does Windoze manage this ?

What is the main drawback of this ?
What happens when I send a block of 3000 bytes to the midi device under
OSS/Free ?
A 100% CPU usage for 1sec ?
I can't believe this.

200bytes/sec is just rudiculous , how do you plan to drive an external synth
with that little MIDI bandwidth ?
Many songs uses up much of the 3000 bytes/sec bandwidth, especially
when there are many  controller/pitchbend events present.
Do you know if the RX FIFO of the MPU401 has the same problem (no interrupt) or
is there an interrupt present ?
Is there no other way to make the MIDI response better, without increasing HZ
to 1000 ?
Does this mean that sequencers running under Windows have the same problems
as we in Linux on the AWE64 ?
Or does Windows a "sane" busywaiting all the time ?  :-)
With these big midi delays you can't simply use your PC to act as a midi-tru
box, playing an external synth via masterkeyboard connected to the midi-in.

If this is true, then I will throw away my AWE64 and buy an AudioPCI
:-)
