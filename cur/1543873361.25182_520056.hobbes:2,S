Well, I'd like it to be 100% _eventually_, and just unify the 
architectures.
We've now done that both for S/390 and POWER, and I think in both cases 
it's been a clear win. So it's not like this is even a radical idea.
The POWER architecture merge was actually done exactly the incremental 
way, one file or directory at a time, and seemed to work out fine.
So while I'd like 100%, I'd be happy to even just get started with the 
really obvious stuff. And the stuff that we *already* share certainly fall 
under that "really obvious" label.

That's really illogical, because historially, i386 was the main one, so 
you'd have to either:
 - have a really strange mix
OR
 - move files around just to share them.
So I'd much rather have just a totally new architecture, and hope that we 
can migrate more and more to it. Whether we ever get to the POWER 
situation where only some really odd-ball special cases are still using 
ppc or not, who knows? It might be, for example, that only the odder i386 
cases (ie the "non-PC" subarchitectures - Voyager, Summit, NUMAQ and the 
like) would stay in i386.
There really is almost nothing in i386 that shouldn't be supported on 
x86-64 too, unless it literally is the actual low-level asm files and vm86 
mode support (which in turn is best left as just a config option that 
would just *depend* on 32-bit, so even that could sanely be represented 
in a shared tree without any real downside at all).
