In context you have cut, one updated signal mask between calls to event
delivery mechanism (using for example signal()), so it has exactly the
same price.

I created it just because I think that POSIX workaround to add signals
into the syscall parameters is not good enough.
Exactly with the same logic I created kevent to drive AIO completeness,
to work with socket notifications and timers and so on.
All above (listio(), poll(), setitimer() and so on) are known and good 
interfaces, but practice shows that having one interface, which can 
easily work with all existing cases is much more convenient than having 
tons of them.
So, yes, I do introduce new mechanism to solve signal problem here, just
because I think all existing have some limitations or problems.

And it was designed very good, although it looks like we disagree a bit
here...

You again cut my explanation on why just pure timeout is used.
We start a syscall, which can block forever, so we want to limit it's
time, and we add special parameter to show how long this syscall should
run. Timeout is not about how long we should sleep (which indeed can be
absolute), but how long syscall should run - which is related to the 
time syscall started.
