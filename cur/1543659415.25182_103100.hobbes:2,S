I've been wondering about this as the goto-thread spewed by.
As I recall, gcc recently started moving basic blocks around.
This destroyed most of the careful goto-based optimizations.
Now we're supposed to use likely() and unlikely() instead.
Hmmm?
BTW, what I'd like is a way to change optimization settings
on a per-function or even per-block basis. Telling gcc to
unroll a specific loop or pack a function into a tiny space
would be really cool.   __attribute__((__opt__("-Os")))
I could go for an "assume default case can't happen" too.
