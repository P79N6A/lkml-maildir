    x86: replace LOCK_PREFIX in futex.h
    The exception fixup for the futex macros __futex_atomic_op1/2 and
    futex_atomic_cmpxchg_inatomic() is missing an entry when the lock
    prefix is replaced by a NOP via SMP alternatives.
    Chuck Ebert tracked this down from the information provided in:
    
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=429412
    A possible solution would be to add another fixup after the
    LOCK_PREFIX, so both the LOCK and NOP case have their own entry in the
    exception table, but it's not really worth the trouble.
    Simply replace LOCK_PREFIX with lock and keep those untouched by SMP
    alternatives.
