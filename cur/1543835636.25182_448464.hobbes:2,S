Node setup is architecture specific and quite different between x86-64
and ia64. I guess one could factor out some common sanity code though, but I'm 
not sure it is worth it. Iirc ia64 doesn't do much sanity checking because
they assume the firmware was written by sane people; x86-64 doesn't have
that luxury.
