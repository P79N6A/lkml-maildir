This thread started with SYSCTL but seems to have drifted to
SYSFS (???) for some unknown reason :-)
Anyway, INET does not need to depend upon SYSCTL.
All the code in net/ that depends on SYSCTL has already
been neatly separated out ...
Patch (tested with attached .config) below explains and resolves
the build failure. Kindly apply.

[PATCH] include sysctl.h from inetdevice.h
When CONFIG_INET=y and CONFIG_SYSCTL=n:
In file included from net/core/netpoll.c:16:
include/linux/inetdevice.h:15: error:
'__NET_IPV4_CONF_MAX' undeclared here (not in a function)
make[2]: *** [net/core/netpoll.o] Error 1
make[1]: *** [net/core] Error 2
make: *** [net] Error 2
So #include sysctl.h from inetdevice.h.
