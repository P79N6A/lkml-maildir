Think _embedded_.  Think "cost of flash chips".  Think "not everything

I'm sorry, believe it or not, but I'm not swayed by "business benefits"
here.  Although I have my own business in the UK, we as a business are
currently involved in hardware design which has nothing to do with the
points I'm raising here.

Indeed and understandable.

I've been working on klibc to work towards providing such a solution.
I know what it involves, and I know that this solution isn't there yet.
Also, the fundamentals of klibc have not been accepted by Linus, so we
don't even know if this is going to be a solution yet.

Just about every ARM kernel development downloads kernels via XMODEM
and the ability to bring networking up and mount a NFS-root filesystem
is by fair the easiest way to develop on *any* embedded device with
Ethernet.
I suppose you could say I have a _community_ interest here - an interest
in ensuring that the ARM community has the resources to be able to continue
using Linux.
So, while the big server people run around removing functionality they
don't need, they make other parts of the community suffer.  Is that
really what Open Source is about?  Suffering? 8)
