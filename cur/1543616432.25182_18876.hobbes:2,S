Rubbish, a VM is supposed to improve, not make it impossible to
run programs after an upgrade. Keeping Linux working on low memory
machines is definately a big issue for the VM I'm developing and
I suspect it's near the top of Andrea's list too...

Absolutely agreed, the thing should just work.
If you have the time, you could try my latest -rmap patch,
available at:
	
http://surriel.com/patches/2.4/2.4.17-rmap-11a
I've done some testing with 'mem=9m' (using a rather fat
kernel w/ profiling) and it seems to work decently.
regards,
Rik
