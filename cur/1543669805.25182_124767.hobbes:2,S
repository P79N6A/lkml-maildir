This looks the wrong place to fix this problem Geert. The PPC 
folks have the same issues with byte order on busses but you
won't see ifdefs in the core IDE code for it.
Fix your __ide_mm_insw/ide_mm_outsw macros and the rest happens
automatically.
Linus, until better justification of why this has to be here
can you not apply this change.
