interesting.  but for sure it was a data CD in the drive. I only typed
	rmmod sr_mod
	mount /cdrom
and it worked again...

I inserted a data CD, tried to mount  it and got the error message above.
now, this happend the first time after I switched to 2.2.13 _and_ after 
I've used cdparanoia and cdda2wav ever, so I'm not sure if my problem
is related to the new kernel version or to the usage of these tools.
before getting that error with the data CD, the last access to the CD drive
was using cdparanoia and cdda2wav with an audio CD (that happend the day
before the data CD error, no other accesses between (and of course no reboot;)).
I just tried and I reall can reproduce the problem using
	Host: scsi0 Channel: 00 Id: 05 Lun: 00
	  Vendor: TOSHIBA  Model: CD-ROM XM-3701TA Rev: 0236
	  Type:   CD-ROM                           ANSI SCSI revision: 02
	# insert audio CD
	cdparanoia -Q
	# insert data CD
	mount /cdrom
works ok,
	# insert audio CD
	cdparanoia -B 1
	# insert data CD
	mount /cdrom
works fine too, BUT
	# insert audio CD
	cdparanoia -B 1
and then abort cdparanoia with ^C and afterwards try
	# insert data CD
	mount /cdrom
results in 
	SCSI CD error : host 0 id 5 lun 0 return code = 28000002
	[valid=0] Info fld=0x0, Current sr0b:00: sense key Blank Check
	Additional sense indicates Illegal mode for this track
	CD-ROM I/O error: dev 0b:00, sector 64
	isofs_read_super: bread failed, dev=0b:00, iso_blknum=16, block=32
if I run `cdparanoia -Q' after aborting a previous grabbing session,
the problem won't show up.
looks like cdparanoia does some strange thing with either the drive
or the driver and doesn't restore it correctly (or the driver doesn't ?!)
after it gets aborted...
