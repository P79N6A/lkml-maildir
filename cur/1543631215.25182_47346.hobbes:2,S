	In response to Thomas Huber's query about possible restoration
of the Adaptec AIC-5800 firewire controller driver, I have made a tar
file of my linux-2.5.17 ieee1394 tree available at
	
ftp://ftp.yggdrasil.com/private/adam/outgoing/firewire-2.5.17.tar.gz.
	This version of the drivers/ieee1394 subtree includes an
aic5800 driver that I have been updating in the sense that I ensure
that it compiles and seems logical from my very cursory looks at it.
If anyone wants to try it, that would be great.
