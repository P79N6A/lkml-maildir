As Alex said, since applications expect it to be there I see no reason to
remove it.

Since the boot process is predictable, it would be much easier for an
attacker to set up an identical setup and it would be no problem at all to
predict the random sequence. Then it would probably be easy to
do a DoS attack forcing the system to reboot and then break in.

This sounds bogus to me..;-)
I don't buy it!
