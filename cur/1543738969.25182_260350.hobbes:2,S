I am using the r8169 driver with NAPI and preemptable kernel.  I don't
remember or see any option for offloading but it sounds like something
I'd turn on.  Let me know what I should look for in my config, or
check here:

I no longer have a 2nd nic adapter, but I did first notice the problem
when I installed this one.  However, if I don't load that module I'm
not able to duplicate the problem by running named on the other
interface.  Running named triggers it 100% of the time on the r8169
based nic.
The arch is x86 (athlon) with just 1 cpu.  Since I'm not sure what's
wrong here I'm not sure what's relevant.  Here is more info about my
setup:
