Hold on. What do they return upon access()? I've looked through the
available kernel sources and results are:
	has r/o filesystems	access()	open()
v3:		no
v5, v6:		yes		N/A		EROFS
v7:		yes		EROFS		EROFS
PDP versions of BSD prior to 2.10, Ultrix 3.1, SysIII, PWB: same as v7
4.4BSD:		yes		ok		ok
{Free,Net,Open}BSD, Linux prior to 2.2.6 and post 2.4.0-test9-pre7: ditto
2.10BSD, 2.10.1BSD, 2.11BSD: ditto
4.3-Tahoe and later: ditto, judging by date of 2.10 release.
What you are saying is that recent SysV variants have
		yes		?		ok
Nice, but what do they do on access()? If they do not return EROFS for
devices - that's it, standard needs to be fixed and 2.2 should drop the
special-casing in sys_access().
