Yeah ... it only works because the device_init_wakeup() is
done in the driver (sigh) instead of the device setup code.
Now that's only done if that IRQ was correctly requested,
so that bit does double duty.
Previously the driver always freeed that IRQ, even if it
hadn't actually managed to request it ... ;)
