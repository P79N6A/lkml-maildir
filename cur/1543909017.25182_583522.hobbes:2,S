I agree, the "tsk != current" case is not nice. We can forbid fetching
signals from another thread group and remove it, this is very easy.
Until then, we can't avoid it without the code duplication.
But SIGNAL_STOP_DEQUEUED code should be OK, afaics. We only need it to
make sure do_signal_stop() can't miss SIGNAL_STOP_CONTINUED/GROUP_EXIT.
Can't we remove SIGNAL_STOP_DEQUEUED, btw?
	dequeue_signal:
		if (sig_kernel_stop(sig))
			->flags &= ~SIGNAL_STOP_CONTINUED;
	do_signal_stop:
		if (flags & (SIGNAL_STOP_CONTINUED | SIGNAL_GROUP_EXIT))
			return 0;
Possible?
Oleg.
