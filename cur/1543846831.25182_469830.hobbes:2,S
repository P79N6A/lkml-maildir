I'm away from my regular work systems at the moment, but I have a  
couple ideas:

Since GCC doesn't actually _do_ anything with __extension__ in the  
object output files, it must be a C-file-based parser problem, so you  
should probably be able to build one of the problematic modules and  
diff the resultant .cmd files, the .mod files, and the .mod.c files.   
Sorry I can't be of more help.
