The fact that it's a no-op may simply be because nobody on a specific
arch got to the point where it made sense to define it yet.
Anyway, based on Jesse and Jeremy's comments, then maybe the semantics
here are different. However I do think the name wc_wmb() isn't quite
defining it. If it's only to be used on mmio space, something like
mmio_wc_wmb() would probably be more descriptive.
Cheers,
Jes
