Well, since each node's memory (or memblk in the parlance of my head ;) 
has several 'zones' in it (DMA, HIGHMEM, etc), this conversion function 
will need 2 parameters.  It may well be called 
__node_and_zone_type_to_flat_zone_number(node, DMA|NORMAL|HIGHMEM).
Or, we could have:
__zone_to_node(5) = node #
and
__zone_to_zone_type(5) = DMA|NORMAL|HIGHMEM.
But either way, we would need to specify both pieces.
Cheers!
