It isn't automatically easier, but it *can* be.
In your case above, with kinit, I would have added dash and strace (the 
latter would probably have to be statically linked against glibc; I 
haven't actually tried building strace under klibc myself) -- or even 
gdb -- to initramfs, and have /init drop into a shell.  From there one 
can run strace -f on kinit.
One of the criticisms I've gotten for klibc has been why I have included 
dash and a whole bunch of shell utilities when they're not used by the 
default kernel build.  It certainly hasn't been just to prove a point; 
as a matter of fact, getting dash to build correctly under Kbuild proved 
to be surprisingly difficult.  However, by making sure that one can 
*easily* pull together an interactive environment -- even if one didn't 
have one from the start -- one has more readily access to a debuggable 
environment.
Similarly, I try very hard to have small, individually testable modules. 
  I haven't taken that even as far as I'd like to have, in the end, but 
that's on my list of things to do.
