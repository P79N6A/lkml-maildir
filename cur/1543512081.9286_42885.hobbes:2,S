Subject: Relocating mem_map to the upper end of main memory?

Hi,
We have experienced some problems with large memories:
at around a memory size of 800MB, the mem_map has grown so large that it
extends above the 16MB boundary, leaving very little memory for those
kernel components that request ISA-DMA-able memory (AAMOF only base
memory is left).
I have attempted to relocate the mem_map to "the other end" of memory,
i.e. aligning it with end_mem rather than start_mem. It looked as if it
was feasable, but the system choked at some time, causing me to wonder:
Question: Is there any reason why the mem_map must be at the lower end
of memory or can I go ahead and relocate it to the upper end? The
relocation is pretty straight-forward, but I am unsure of the over-all
(side-)effects that it may cause and additional changes that might be
required.
BTW Please CC me on your reply.
Josef
