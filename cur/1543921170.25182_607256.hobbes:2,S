OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOPS!
Of course, we can't!!! I remembered there was this issue long time
ago, but then I've had some break in tracking net & workqueue. So,
while reading this patch I was alarmed at first, and self-misled
later. I think, there is definitely needed some warning about
locking (or unlocking) during these flush_ & cancel_ functions.
(Btw, I've very much wondered now, why I didn't notice at that 'old'
time, that you added such a great feature (wrt. locking) and I even
didn't notice this...). 
So, Maciej (and other readers of this thread) - I withdraw my false
opinion from my second message here: it's very wrong to call this
sched_work_sync() with rtnl_lock(). It's only less probable to lockup
with this than with flush_schedule_work().

Looks like a very good idea, but I need more time to rethink this.
Probably some code example should be helpful.

Until monday I should have an opinion on that (today a bit under
fire...).

Since there is no gain wrt. locking with my current proposal, I
withdraw this patch of course.
It looks like my wrong patch was great idea because we got this very
precious Oleg's opinion! (I know I'm a genius sometimes...)
Thanks very much,
