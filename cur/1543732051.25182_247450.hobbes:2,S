It's already marked BROKEN_ON_SMP, but even a UP compile yields tons of
errors.  While those aren't deeply complicated to fix having them for over
a year now is a pretty good indicator no one cares.

If I revert mark-pcxx-as-broken.patch, the driver compiles UP for me 
with exactly zero errors or warnings.
@Christoph:
Could you post the errors you observed?
