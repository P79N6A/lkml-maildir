Alain , I am pasting you an email i got from Marcelo Tosatti, which I
think clarifies pretty well the history of 2.4.24 and 2.4.25 :
-- snip --
2.4.24 was under development (had -pre1, -pre2 and -pre3 released). 
At that point, we had to release 2.4.24 without the "-pre" changes (only
with the security fixes). 
So basically 2.4.24-pre was renamed to 2.4.25-pre, and 2.4.25-pre4 was 
released.
