Indeed, I should have checked more carefully. My bad.
Still, it is not obvious that one should go into a completly different
config section and manually enable sd support, and I have been bitten
by this more than one time.
Maybe we should add, just below the 'USB storage' Kconfig option another
one, let's say 'SCSI disk based USB storage support', which documentation
would talk about 'usb keys, memory stick readers, USB floppy drives etc',
which should just be a dummy option selecting  BLK_DEV_SD ?
Or perhaps we should add something along the Debian's dpkg 'suggests' rule
to Kconfig ? :)
Stelian.
