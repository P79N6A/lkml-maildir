The problem of kexec-dump is that initialization of devices depends
on the quality of device driver when kexec reboots system. Sometimes the
device drivers tacitly rely on the firmware to initialize them.
Anyway, most important point is that kexec-dump is not available enough
now. I think kexec-dump is not stable yet. I heard that kexec-dump of
some architecture (ex. ia64) had some problems and not worked.
