For a strict posix system, but then if we were a strict posix/sus system
you wouldn't be able to use mmap. Also the kernel doesn't claim to
implement posix behaviour, it avoids those areas were posix is stupid.

POSIX_ME_HARDER was an environment variable GNU tools used when users
wanted them to do stupid but posix mandated things instead of sensible
things. It was later changed to POSIXLY_CORRECT, which lost the point
somewhat.

I doubt that. Sane applications are written to the BSD socket API not
POSIX 1003.1g draft 6.4 and relatives.
