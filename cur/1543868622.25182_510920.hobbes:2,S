I blacklisted the k8temp driver (and the out-of-tree k8_edac driver
in Fedora) and the temps were still volatile, so that's not causing
it. Since then I've upgraded the system BIOS from F.06 to F.27 and
the problems _may_ have gone away. My own custom 2.6.19 kernel has
never been a problem, so I'm thinking it's one of these drivers
loaded by Fedora that I never even compile:
	i2c_core
	i2c_ec
	i2c_piix4
	asus_acpi (on a Compaq???)
	sbs
