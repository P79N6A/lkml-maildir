This is not a safe assumption, because the OS may reprogram the PCI BARs
at certain times.  The rule is:  ALWAYS read from dev->resource[] unless
you are a bus driver (PCI bridges, for example, need to assign
resources).
Further, access to PCI BARs -and- dev->resource[] in a driver is wrong
until you have called pci_enable_device.  Resource and IRQ assignment
potentially occurs at pci_enable_device time, so BAR is [potentially]
undefined before then.
Finally, make sure to use pci_resource_{start,end,len,flags} macros to
make your core more portable and future-proof.

We will yell at you mightily if you directly access PCI mem with a
pointer.  As you say it only works on i386 -- but IIRC since ioremap is
required, we are perfectly free to change or modify that assumption. 
For example ioremap might [have to] care about whether or not a pci mem
region is prefetchable.
