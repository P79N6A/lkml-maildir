That's what I thought, too... and I really killed everything that I could
imagine accessing the disk... but...

... that really helped! I'm kind of surprised, since I didn't use noatime
before the update, and I still don't know of any process that might do
the reading, but since mounting / with noatime helped, I'm happy for now.
My curiosity isn't completely gone, though, so maybe one day I'll try to
find out who-is-trying-to-read-what, "find -atime ..." didn't reveal the secret
yet.
