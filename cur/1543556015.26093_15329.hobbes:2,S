This patch looks reasonable.
Perhaps it would be better to have the driver retain the skbuff until the
transmit succeeds, and only then add the length to the stats.  But this
specific bug is related the ISA bounce buffer code.  Any ISA card is in
the "legacy" category, so it's better to make minimal change needed to
correct the obvious potential problem.
