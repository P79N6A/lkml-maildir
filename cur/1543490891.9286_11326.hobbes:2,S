Ok, sorry if it's been reported before, but I checked the list archives
and no sign.  Nor am I sure if it's kernel related or not, I just know
that the locate command worked in 2.2.3 (running it now), but does not in
2.2.4 (tested two different kernel compiles, one with modules, one
without.)
Issue is this.  I run updatedb, wait, grab a beer, write a novel, then run
a locate command (locate tcl is the one I did as an experiment), it finds
one file then dumps core.  Doing the same thing under 2.2.3 works fine.
Hope someone knows how to fix since I have no idea. 
Thanks 
Nick Seafort
