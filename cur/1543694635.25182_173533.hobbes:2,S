   With vesafb, you should be able to get any resultion you want at
   60Hz. Which is okay, because you have LCD.
Not necessarily, at least not on a VAIO R505EL  This is due to the well-
known (to some X hackers at least) 'stolen memory' problem.  Yes, you can 
have 1024x768x8 with 'vesafb' (0x305), but if i use 'vga=ask', then i 
can't get it to accept anything of the form 0x31x (e.g., nothing more 
than 256 colors).  And netscape/mozilla grabs everything in sight, so if 
you want a color that 'netscape' doesn't use after 'netscape' has been
started, you're out of luck.
   drivers/char/drm/i830_drv driver is apparently using DMA _and_ has no
   suspend/resume support. That looks dangerous to me, perhaps you'll
   need to implement those, too.
Yeah, i looked at that driver and couldn't figure out how it was supposed
to hand suspend/resume, but didn't have anything to compare it with.  So
thank you for remark, as i was wondering if that were the case.  Basically
what i think it comes to is that whatever initialization that X does to
a display when it starts up needs to be done again after software suspend.
Given that i doubt X knows anything about software suspend, the underlying
kernel code is going to have to remember whatever X wanted and repeat that.
I did look very briefly at 'drivers/video/i810/' (i810/i815 framebuffer
driver), but no free lunch there.  Someone who knows just how the i830m
differs might have a chance at that, but that's too much work for me
to think about right now (e.g. i've got too much else to learn right
now).
So i think your workaround is to use VESA (XF86Config-4 available upon
request), probably only 256 colors, until this problem can be resolved 
with the DRM driver.

P.S.  Uh, do any of the DRM drivers work properly with software suspend
on other machines?
