Because we want to keep dev_t use down as much as possible.  It should
just be a small cookie for looking up the correspoding object where
it's required by posix.  Everywhere outside that scope we better deal
with pathnames because they are much more meaningfull.  And with udev
and dynamic dev_t around the corner the actual values become more and
more meaningless.
