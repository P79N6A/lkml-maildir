>is it possible to do so now, still before .17 release?
I think that on April 3rd this was appropriate.
But now 6 weeks later in the release cycle I don't think it is
appropriate to do such a large pull.
I'm assuming this tree will not be pulled until the start of .18.
Jiri,
Is there a specific individual patch that you are wanting to have in
.17?
thanks,
-Len
