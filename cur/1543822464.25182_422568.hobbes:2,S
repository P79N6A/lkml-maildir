Ok so we got an interrupt this time and then when we asked for it got
told "no". That still shouldn't crash but there are some lurking
problems when ata_device_add fails.
More interesting is how it can occur.
We asked for an IRQ that was "exclusive". We got given IRQ 11 which was
shared. A look at the pcmcia code suggests the new drivers/pcmcia code
is broken here: It may fall back to using an interrupt line that is
shared even when told not to.
What occurs if you change
	ae.irq_flags = 0;
to 
	ae.irq_flags = SA_SHIRQ ?
