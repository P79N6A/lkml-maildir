As far as I know, LMbench tells me what my memory bandwidth is just fine.
I don't care if it is telling me the limit (I know it isn't) I only need
to know relative speeds across platforms.  It does that.

I checked with a guy who works here, he used to work in Intel's processor
group on performance, and he tells me it isn't the processor, it's the 
motherboard.  Which jives nicely with the data.
I'm just hoping there is some SiS genius out there who will ask me
"Did you remember to turn off the go 3x slower mode in the BIOS?"
and I'll hang my head in shame and ask to be directed to that magic
BIOS switch.
