Subject: [PATCH] Make radeonfb work with R300

Hi,
radeonfb is  unable to  acquire the  pll clock values  from the  BIOS on
newer radeon cards and uses default values which don't work.
Using ATI binary driver for X I founded this in the log:
(II) fglrx(0): PLL parameters: rf=2700 rd=12 min=20000 max=40000; xclk=27000
This patch (against 2.5.65) sets pll values according to X:

It works on  a R300 NE (9500 Pro),  but should be ok also  for the other
R300 chips (don't have the hw to make a test though).
In X log there is also this line:
(II) fglrx(0): Primary V_BIOS segment is: 0xc000
I've no idea of what V_BIOS is (Video BIOS?), but it may be useful ;)
HTH,
Luca
