Hi,
Could people please re-send any PCMCIA or serial bugs/patches/whatever
after August 1st, or _CLEARLY_ mark it as such - there is just _too_
much traffic on lkml to filter out the mails sufficiently well... been
reading the last 5 days of lkml and I'm _still_ not up to date, so I'm
currently killing a lot of mail which is not obviously interesting.
