New look at the issue:
Since we are already using UDMA mode set by BIOS to determine if 80c cable
is present so why not also use it to determine if the 40c cable is present?
I mean just ignoring AMD_CABLE_DETECT register for NVIDIA devices.
2-lines change and we wouldn't have to deal with ACPI at ell.
What do you think?
