Easy to name an example, as they are pretty generic.  When sharing irqs 
-- usually ATA is configured to PCI native (IO-APIC-fasteoi) -- any 
interrupt storm causes the other devices sharing that irq to crap 
themselves (kernel turns off irq, suggests irqpoll, etc.)
ATA is unfortunately easier to cause interrupt storms than most because 
the standard PCI IDE definition has __no__ possible way to indicate 
certain interrupt conditions are pending.  You have to /know/ that you 
are expecting an interrupt, which causes problems if the hardware 
decides to send the interrupt early or late, rather than when its 
expected.  Most modern hardware has a read/write/clear interrupt status 
  register that gives you an immediate summary of the pending interrupt 
conditions, and an easy way to ack the pending events.  ATA does not 
have any such capability.
That said, stuff like AHCI or sata_sil or sata_sil24 do have modern 
designs with the expected interrupt status register(s), so they do not 
suffer from the problems suffered by the more legacy-like hardware 
(ata_piix, sata_via, pata_*)
