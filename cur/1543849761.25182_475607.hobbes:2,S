Right. It's a little tricky though regarding what happens when you
write to the register mapping of a running guest, without stopping
it first.

what for? writing 1, then 0 to that file is two full syscalls.
Calling kvm_run and returning from it is just one.
You can also just send SIGSTOP/SIGCONT to the task to stop it.

It's very handy to stay inside of a single process context for both
the hypervisor and the guest, and to simply block in a kvm_run syscall
for the time the guest executes.
This syscall can then simply return the exit reason as its return
value so you don't need another syscall to read it.

I would not mix ioctls with a new file system. ioctl is fine on
a character device, but with a new file system, you should be able
to express everything as read/write, or one of the new syscalls.
