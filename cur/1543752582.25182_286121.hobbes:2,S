Subject: [patch 2/8] uml: readd CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ for UML
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/1/13/142

From: Paolo 'Blaisorblade' Giarrusso <blaisorblade_spam@yahoo.it>
This config option was lost during the creation of lib/Kconfig.debug, due to a
bad expressed dependency; I also moved the option back to its original place
for UML (it is near CONFIG_MCONSOLE since it depends on that).

+config MAGIC_SYSRQ
+	bool "Magic SysRq key"
+	depends on MCONSOLE
+	---help---
+	If you say Y here, you will have some control over the system even
+	if the system crashes for example during kernel debugging (e.g., you
+	will be able to flush the buffer cache to disk, reboot the system
+	immediately or dump some status information). A key for each of the
+	possible requests is provided.
+
+	This is the feature normally accomplished by pressing a key
+	while holding SysRq (Alt+PrintScreen).
+
+	On UML, this is accomplished by sending a "sysrq" command with
+	mconsole, followed by the letter for the requested command.
+
+	The keys are documented in <file:Documentation/sysrq.txt>. Don't say Y
+	unless you really know what this hack does.
