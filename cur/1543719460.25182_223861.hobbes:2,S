I might have done it already (depending on your requirements).

I recently launched Rubyx, a source based linux distro and almost bankrupted 
myself with bandwidth bills in the first two days after mentioning it on 
Slashdot. So, I investigated BitTorrent as a possible solution. I found it 
lacking in many respects, so I wrote White-Water, which I was actually going 
to anounce this weekend, but in the light of this thread, some useful 
comments or suggestions might be forthcoming from you and others who have 
already considered the problem space in detail.
I'd be happy to implement any useful features I might have overlooked.
