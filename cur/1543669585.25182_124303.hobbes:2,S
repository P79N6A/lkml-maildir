Simple solution - duplicate at open() but remove on close() if unchanged.

If you want this, you want a copy-on-write fs.  Of course it needs a
different fsck.

It is renamed - nothing special there.  Renaming onto an existing file
makes the renamed file the most recent version of that file.
"mv foo;2 foo" turns foo;2 into the current version - this is one
way of restoring an old version without deleting the newer ones.

VMS let you open() any previous version for writing. I don't remember 
exactly,
but I believe this creates a new version with a version number higher 
than the
highest existing version of the file.  Either that, or you modify the 
old file.
Backup is not a problem.  You don't want to create new versions while 
restoring,
so either remove existing files before recreating from backup (You
can then explicitly create "file.txt;45") or implement some open flag
that means "use exactly this filename - no messing with versioning" I 
think the
first approach is better  it keeps the interface smaller.

I remember trying this. If foo;3 exists (but not foo;2 and lower) then
the numbering of new versions go upwards and simply skips the existing ones.

We can if we want to - by redefining whats legal.  This isn't a problem 
at all
if we take the approach that opening "foo" does the versioning automatically
while explicitly opening "foo;x" opens that particular version.  Users 
creating
a "fake" version of a file isn't a problem - they simply created a new 
version
that happened to not be based on the contents of the previous one.
