How about we call it "memory_usage"?  That would kill two birds with one
stone: get rid of the comment, and keep people from needing to refer to
the comment to figure out what "res" *IS*.

Why not just rename "list" to "lru_list" or "container_lru"?

I'd probably break that line up differently:
static inline
struct mem_container *mem_container_from_cont(struct container *cnt)
BTW, do I see "cnt" meaning "container" now instead of "cnt"?  ;)
Is somebody's favorite dog named "cnt" and you're just trying to remind
yourself of them as often as possible?
