Some things to try:
1: Include `magic sysrq' support in the kernel and use ALT-SYSRQ-T and S
   when it has locked up.   If you get some traces then please feed them
   into `ksymoops -m System.map' and report back.
2: If the above doesn't work, add `nmi_watchdog=1' to the kernel boot
   options.  That may catch the lockup.
3: Replace the NIC with another eepro100.  If the problem goes away then
   chuck the old one.
4: Replace the NIC with one of a different type (ie: swap with the other
   machine). If that fixes it we look at the ethernet driver.  Otherwise
   we look at, umm, the rest of the kernel.
