I've had considerable trouble with bootp in the 2.1 series of kernels
and now, the 2.2 series.  Whenever I compile a kernel later that the
2.0.* series, everything seems to work wonderfully, except for bootp.
Upon bootup the kernel runs through all the system checks/startups
as usual, but when it attempts to configure eth0 with bootp, this is
what I get:
SIOCSIFBRDADDR: Cannot assign requested address
SIOCSIFNETMASK: Cannot assign requested address
Sending bootp request
No bootp response recieved -- not configuring device eth0.
Unfortunately, I know very little of the kernel itself.  Nonetheless, I
made some attempts to decipher the meaning of this, and got so
far as finding that these are(correct me if I'm wrong) kernel flags
which are set somewhere and then referenced by the network
device drivers in /usr/src/linux/net/core. Also, they(the "flags")
were mentioned in /usr/include/ioctls.h.
I currently run Redhat 5.2 with bootpc version 0.64(0.61 until I
upgraded).  My ethernet card is a 100baseT 3Com 3c905 and
works perfectly with the 2.0.36 kernel.  I can configure networking
just fine under the 2.2 kernels  by using a static IP, but
unfortunately the network admins here don't look too kindly upon
that, so I need to be able to autoconfigure my routing tables with
bootp.
Any ideas as to what the problem is would be greatly appreciated.
