After waking up my machine from a sleep, the network goes in fits and starts.
Any network connections will pause for a bit, then flow for a bit, and so on.
The network card is Tulip-based (either a d-link or linksys) in an Athlon
box running standard RH6.2 with apmd.  A reboot is necessary to restore
the network functionality.
