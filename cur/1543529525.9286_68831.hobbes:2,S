Well, I'm quite happy with the size of my Toshiba Satellite's keyboard.
Like the IBM thinkpads, they feel nearly "full size" but don't take much
room.
I think IBM had a keyboard where the keys move down into the machine
when you close it.  Maybe that's what the Thinkpads do.
It's the screen the I'd _really_ like folded.  A screen large enough to
viewed for hours currently makes for too large a laptop.
