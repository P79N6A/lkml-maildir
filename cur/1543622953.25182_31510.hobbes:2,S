I'm looking at merging the changes made to JFFS2 in 2.5, with the intention 
of again having a single codebase that compiles in both 2.5 and 2.4.
I'm a little confused by the changes to recalc_sigpending().
It seems that the name of the function was changed to recalc_sigpending_tsk()
and a new function called recalc_sigpending() was added.
Was there a reason for doing this, rather than just introducing the new 
function with a different name, such as recalc_sigpending_cur()? It breaks 
2.4 source compatibility in a way that seems entirely gratuitous.
Before I have to go and do something evil in my compatmac.h to work round 
this, is there any chance of putting the original recalc_sigpending() back?
Linus, would you accept such a patch?
