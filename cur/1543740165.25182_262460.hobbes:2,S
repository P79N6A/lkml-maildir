5% residency in the clock tick handler is likely more of a problem when
we're _not_ idle -- a 5% performance hit.  When we're idle we've got
nothing better to do with the processor than run these instructions for
5% of the time and run no instructions 95% of the time -- so tick
handler residency isn't the problem in idle, tick frequency is the
problem.
When an interrupt occurrs, the hardware needs to ramp up its voltages,
resume its clocks and all the stuff it need to do to get out of the
power saving state to run the code that services the interrupt.  This
"exit latency" can take a long time.  On a volume Centrino system today
it is up to 185usec.  On other hardware it is as high as 1000 usec. 
Time spent in this exit latency is a double penalty -- we're not saving
power and we're delaying before the processor starts executing
instructions -- so we want to pay this price only when necessary.
