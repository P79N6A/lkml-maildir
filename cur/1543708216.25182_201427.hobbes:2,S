Wow! That's a lot of no-no. But we'll let the code speak for itself. The
major driving force behind the unified design is support for MPT raid
controllers and also a single code base, with a very small footprint patch -
if at all required, to support various kernels.
In this driver, the base kernel is assumed to be a lk 2.6.x with appropriate
APIs added for lk 2.4.x.
I recommend reading the concise design document, mraid_hotplug.doc, which
explains the overall layout of the driver and some design concerns. This
document is part of the driver package.
Obviously we are open to all suggestions and ready to modify the code if
there is a general feeling in that direction. Also, this driver would
required to sit in a directory because of a split in files
The driver package is available in usual location, too big to be inlined :-)
