Works. All states are now listed again.
I've not tested suspend to disk, but suspend to ram and power off work fine.

Isn't there a risk now that we now end up printing
   ACPI: (supports)
if CONFIG_SUSPEND is not enabled and >S4 is not supported?
Or, more probably, it would print
   ACPI: (supports S5)
as it is unlikely that "off" is not supported :-)
Maybe S0 should be taken outside the #ifdef and the loop as that state is 
also basically always there?
Thanks,
