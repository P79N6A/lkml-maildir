Thank you to everyone who made suggestions.  This is about it.  I can't
make everyone happy, but at least I hope I didn't seriously annoy
anyone.  Two years from now, we'll probably move this discussion to
another list to keep the non-technical traffic off the kernel mailing
list.
(By the way, I did finally catch the redundant kernel.org reference.)

**** DRAFT **** PRESS RELEASE - LINUX KERNEL 2.2.0 **** DRAFT ****
**** FORK 1 **** FINAL-7 DRAFT
Linux kernel version 2.2.0 released
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Contact: linux-2.2@linuxunited.org
SANTA CLARA, C.A. -- Today Linus Torvalds, the primary developer and
coordinator of the Linux kernel team, releases a major new version of
the
Linux kernel.  This update brings substantial performance improvements
and
a multitude of new features.
* Routing and wide area network (WAN) support enables Linux to replace
  proprietary network devices.  Support for virtual private networks,
  mobile computing, firewalling, resource control, and accounting puts
  users in charge of their own intranets.
* Strong 256-bit encryption, uncompromised by US export restrictions, is
  available as an add-on component. It protects both network
  infrastructure and hard disk storage.
* With its tradition of open and international development, Linux is an
  operating system ready for the new millennium.  Linux 2.2 remains
  Y2K-ready, and continues to build on previous versions'
  internationalization support.
* Enterprise-level network filesystem support, with data replication for
  performance, mobility, and extreme reliability, ensures that file
  server destruction does not stop business.
* New multimedia capabilities in Linux 2.2 include video capture
support,
  TV tuner support, and enhanced audio support.
* A wide variety of new SCSI and parallel-port devices are now
supported,
  including disk drives, tape drives, and other external devices.
* Already legendary performance is significantly enhanced.  High-end
  symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) support scales well, supporting
systems
  with up to 64 processors.
* Compatibility with Windows NT and BSD filesystems enables Linux 2.2 to
  seamlessly handle data from legacy systems.  With Samba, a Linux
system
  can transparently replace all NT Server functions, including file- and
  print-sharing and domain authentication.
* Because Linux operates under an open development model, every user can
  modify the operating system components, and submit improvements for
the
  official distribution. This eases the development of new features, and
  lets users repair problems immediately as they are discovered.
Linux 2.2 is available for free download via the Internet.  For a list
of
the "mirror servers" established in anticipation of the massive demand
for
this new release, visit the Linux Kernel Archive
(
http://www.kernel.org/
).
As always, the Linux kernel is distributed as Free Software under the
terms
of the GNU General Public License
(
http://www.fsf.org/copyleft/gpl.html
).
Linux distribution vendors are expected to ship fully-integrated systems
using the new kernel before Q2 1999.  Business users should look to
their
distribution vendors for information about this important upgrade.
ABOUT LINUX
"Linux" is the common name for a class of secure network operating
systems
based on the Linux kernel and other open source software including the
Free
Software Foundation's GNU Project, the Apache web server, Samba, the X
Window System, and portions of BSD.  Linux takes full advantage of
modern,
high-end x86, Power Mac, Alpha, and UltraSPARC hardware.  It can also
breathe life into older machines -- even 386- and 486-based computers.
Networks of Linux computers can provide supercomputer-like performance
for
some applications; one widely-known example is the dramatic 3-D scenes
in
the blockbuster movie "Titanic", which were rendered on Alpha-powered
Linux
systems.
Both traditional support contracts and cost-effective Internet support
resources are readily available.  Linux is provided under an
unlimited-use
license that lets users make in-house customizations to the system
itself.
Recent estimates suggest that Linux has up to 20 million users
worldwide.
Microsoft employees Vinod Valloppillil and Josh Cohen, in a competitive
examination of Linux (The so-called "Halloween Document",
http://www.opensource.org/halloween.html
), write that Linux "is trusted
on
mission critical applications, and - due to its open source code - has a
long term credibility which exceeds many other competitive operating
systems."
ABOUT LINUS TORVALDS
Linus Torvalds, originally from Finland, lives with his family in Santa
Clara, CA, USA.  He and others created Linux as an open-source
alternative
to proprietary, closed operating systems after becoming disillusioned
with
the poor quality and prohibitive pricing of commercial offerings.

Microsystems, Inc.  Alpha is a trademark of Compaq Computer Corporation.
