Although it has buggy behaviour under some circumstances, 
the foundamental problem of load unfairness on SMP comes from
the fact that a single task can not use more than one CPU at a time.
On condtion that there aren't enough number of runnable tasks on SMP,
achievable shares very depend on how tasks are allocated to CPU. 
So a few busy loops on SMP is a tough case. It is alleviated
by increasing the number of runnable tasks.
Thanks,
