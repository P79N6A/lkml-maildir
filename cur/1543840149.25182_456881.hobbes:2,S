I'm still a bit concerned about if we actually need the 'struct page'
pointer.  I've gone through all of the users, and I'm not sure that I
see any that _require_ having a pointer in 'struct page'.  I think it
will take some rework, especially with the pagetables, but it should be
quite doable.
vmalloc:
	Store in vm_struct
fd_set_bits:
poll_get:
mount hashtable:
	Don't need alignment.  use the slab?
pagetables:
	either store in an extra field of 'struct page', or use the
	mm's.  mm should always be available when alloc/freeing a
	pagetable page
Did I miss any?
