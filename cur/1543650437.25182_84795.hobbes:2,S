Do you mean by putting the `internal' format that initramfs normally
uses in RAM, in ROM, and skip the initial decompression step?
Or do you mean have it somehow avoid copying the data areas of the cpio
stream (i.e. store pointers from the tree-in-ram to the actual data
blocks in ROM).
I guess the latter sounds cleaner... it would also have the advantage
that you could have a tree with the bulk of data in ROM, but which
allowed new files to be written (which would be stored in RAM).
Hmmm...sounds very intersting...
