The decision got taken to allocate barrier bios to implement the basic
flush so dm has little choice in this matter now.  (If you're going to
implement barriers for flush, you might as well implement them more
generally.)
Maybe I should spell this out more clearly for those who weren't
tracking this block layer change:  AFAIK You cannot currently flush a
device-mapper block device without doing some jiggery-pokery.

The last time we tried xfs with dm it didn't seem to notice -EOPNOTSUPP
everywhere it should => recovery may find corruption.
