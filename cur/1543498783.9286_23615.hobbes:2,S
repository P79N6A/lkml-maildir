The former also has some problems besides not being supported:
* It does not support Taggeg Command Queueing and
* (more severe) from time to time you will suffer your SCSI subsystem going
  mad, if your disks use disconnection
I spent some time looking at the sources and I didn't see the bug in the
AM53C974 driver.
On the other hand, I maintain the tmscsim (DC390/AM53C974) driver, which
works very well, so I recommend to use this one to everybody.
If you are interested to test the next version of it, 2.0e (current is
2.0d), have a look at 
http://www.garloff.de/kurt/linux/dc390/
 and try 2.0d9.
It should be _more_ stable than plain 2.0d by design, but I still want to
wait a couple of days before releasing it as 2.0e to the kernel, to have
more people having the opportunity to test it. Until now, I did not see any
failure report for it, yet.
