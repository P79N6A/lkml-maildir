I noticed the same bug. This is very weired, I can send a list of sites
which I can't connect anymore. I've "solved" the problem by installing a
gateway onto a 2.2.18 with a squid on it, so this is the squid which is
doing the http's traffic for my 2.4.0 box.
I though it was a misconfiguration from my side but wasn't able to detect
it.
Perhaps it's linked...
