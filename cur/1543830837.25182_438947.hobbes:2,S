swsusp has problems resumeing after upgrading my Acer Travelmate
4001WLMi from 2.6.16 to 2.6.17. Note that I'm running a Fedora 5
kernel, with the ATI proprietary video driver.
On this 512Mb system, I have typically 60% of memory in use when I go
into hibernate. This is with X, wm, Emacs, some xterms, wireless.
With 2.6.16, when I initiate a hibernate with
  echo shutdown > /sys/power/disk; echo disk > /sys/power/state
I get switched back to vt1(?), the "stopping tasks" messages, and so
on, until the system shuts down in ordinary fashion. 
With 2.6.17, when I initiate the hibernate, I get no apparent reaction
(although the flashing disk led reveals what's going on) and the
system shuts down.
Upon reboot, I get
  Trying to resume from /dev/hda4
  Resuming from /dev/hda4.
  Attempting manual resume
and then the console does a half-hearted attemtp to restore X and
freezes. The system is alive, I can login via the network. Restarting
the X server (from another tty, the console remains stuck) seems to
'cure' the problem. However, when exiting X the console stays
connected to vt7 and needs to be put back to vt1 manually.
It seems to be a problem with the video switching out/in X. 
When I change to a vt out of X, then suspend/resume seems to give no
problem and after resume I can switch back to vt7 into X.
Any suggestions to cure this problem? Is it a know regression?
Thanks,
        Johan
