Perhaps Mark/Jacob can take a look at the oops.

Think: any difference you get for 24h will be 10x when the system runs 10 times longer
and 365 times when the system runs for a year (and there are Linux systems
who run much longer than a year) 
Also even small non monotonies between CPUs in gettimeofday can cause big trouble.
