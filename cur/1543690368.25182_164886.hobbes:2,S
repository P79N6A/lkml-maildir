I have a Dell C400 laptop with both touchpad and pointing stick.  The
touchpad doesn't work in 2.6.0-test.  The driver reports that the reset
failed.
If I use psmouse_noext=1 on boot, the touchpad works but the pointing stick
does not.  Curiously, after an APM suspend/resume cycle, the pointing stick
works normally.
I can provide more detail (config, dmesg, etc.) if this problem isn't
already known and/or being investigated.
