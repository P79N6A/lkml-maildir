Subject: fs corruption with 2.2.10ac4 ?

My machine running 2.2.10ac4 hanged up today, it had more than 2 days of
uptime with _high_ number of compilations and nfs/ftp transfers.  
Some of running processes:  
cpio, mkinitrd, egcs, find.
Machine: IBM Netfinity 3000, 350Mhz Pentium II, Adaptec AIC-7881U SCSI
controller (we got the same problem with a NCR53c875 in another machine).
I had to Alt+SysRq+S various times to see "Done." 
This happened to me twice before with the NCR controller. The second time
(with 2.2.10ac4 too) all files gone (the directories remained). After lots of fsck's the files
"came back" and we had to copy everything to another disk because fsck
always reported errors.
