Crazy ideas : (some readers are going to kill me)
1) Use the low order bit of f_path.dentry to say : this pointer is not a 
pointer to a dentry but the inode pointer (with the low order bit set to 1)
OR
2) file->f_path.dentry set to NULL for this special files (so that we dont 
need to dput() and cache line ping pong the common dentry each time we 
__fput() a pipe/socket.
Same trick could be used for file->f_path.mnt, because there is a big SMP 
cache line ping/pong to maintain a mnt_count on pipe/sockets mountpoint while 
these file systems cannot be un-mounted)
If dentry is NULL, we get the inode pointer from an overlay of struct 
file_ra_state    f_ra; (because for this special files readahead is unused)
This adds some conditional branches of course, but being able to save ram and 
better use cpu caches might be worth them.
