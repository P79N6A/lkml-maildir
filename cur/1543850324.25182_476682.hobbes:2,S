hi,
    i am having 2.6.16-13 kernel .This kernel lack support for broadcom
wireless card.But the latest kernel is having support for this card.
   I download the the kernel ,but i would like to compile this particular
driver only , not the entire kernel.
   Is it possible???
  I tried to execute the following command
  make -C /usr/src/linux-2.6.16-13 SUBDIRS=$PWD  modules
  but got following error  message ..
  ' No reason to target modules'
  How can i compile the driver separately???
