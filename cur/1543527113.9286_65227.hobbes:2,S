Greetings!  There has been a long-standing race problem in autofs.
Briefly, if an autofs mount is being expired while a submount is being
mounted, the autofs process governing the autofs mount can die leaving
live mounts (nfs) under it.  Please see the urls below for more
information.
My question:  Should the recent 'autofs/nfs deadlock' fix in 2.2.14
fix this too?  This is not strictly a deadlock issue.
I'm testing 2.2.14 now, but I can't of course control the exact timing
that leads to the problem.  Please reply quickly if possible:  Debian
will remove autofs from the upcoming distribution if I can't show that
this problem has been resolved in some way.
