Someone apparently thought that 32-bit alignment was a good thing and
put it in the spec for the 32-bit format. You argue that most programs
copy instead of mmap() which sounds correct, but if someone wants to
mmap() then our current 32-bit aligned 64-bit elf note implementation
is broken. Which may or may not be ok.
So why was 32-bit alignment put in the 32-bit spec? I suspect the
reason was to support direct access of note contents. Either using
mmap() or read() and direct access. Remeber that the notes could
contain anything which may require properly aligned data for direct
access. I think this was the reason the word size alignment was put in
the spec for in the first place.
