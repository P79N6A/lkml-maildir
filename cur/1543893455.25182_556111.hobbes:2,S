Actually I tried forcing the PIT (and any other combination of
tsc,acpi_pm,jiffies) as the clocksource, without success.

Ok, will do. Meanwhile I discovered that the kernel on the boot cd
(the one that hangs) is compiled for i586, while the one installed on
disk is for i686 (this one works).
i686 has this options enabled:
+CONFIG_X86_GOOD_APIC=y
+CONFIG_X86_USE_PPRO_CHECKSUM=y
+CONFIG_X86_TSC=y
but disabling tsc on the command line doesn't make any difference. Is
it possible that KVM is choking on some instruction not used by the
i686 kernel?
