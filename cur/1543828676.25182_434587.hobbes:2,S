Almost certainly a problem with the CF adapter. Please verify the card
in a modern CF adapter and also do tests with DMA capable cards of other
types on the adapter you are using.
Back when CF adapters first appeared the idea that you might run DMA on
one was so ludicrously silly that nobody wired the neccessary pins on
the adapters. Time has moved on, but hardware alas has sometimes not.
