Your test is broken.
Read the gcc documentation. A inline asm with no outputs is implicitly
considered volatile. So _both_ your tests had volatile there.
Now, that may not matter that much fo ryour test-case: gcc gets careful
around inline asm anyway, even without the volatile.
Change it to something like
	__asm__("":"=r" (x):"0" (x));
and the "volatile" should matter.
Not for memory references, perhaps. But for the movement issues.
