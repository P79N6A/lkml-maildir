How does that work? fget_light() has a built-in assumption that as
long as you don't share files_struct, it's okay not to take an extra
reference as current is only one doing close(2) and revoke(2) changes
that. So it's not really about being single-threaded or not.

Aah, fget_light() indeed has a race window between fcheck_files() and
set_f_light().
