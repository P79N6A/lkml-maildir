really?  do we know the nature of the DMA engine problem well enough?
is there a reason to believe that it'll work better "later"?
I guess I was surprised at resorting to PIO - couldn't we just
break the request up into smaller chunks, still using DMA?
I seem to recall Andre saying that the problem arises when the 
ide DMA engine looses PCI arbitration during a burst.  shorter 
bursts would seem like the best workaround if this is the problem...
resorting to PIO would be such a shame, not only because it eats
CPU so badly, but also because it has no checksum like UDMA...
thanks, mark hahn.
