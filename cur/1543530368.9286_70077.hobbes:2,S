   For PC it should be a PCI quirk. Say we pick 64 as before and pci_quirk
   overrides min_pci_latency and max_pci_latency ?
   Would that work for you too Dave ?
Martin posted an implementation that works in a way
I like.  A static min/max value for the whole system
does not work for me, consider a mix of controllers
some have the bug some don't have the bug, also consider
a situation where allowable settings are determined by
the total possible consumable cycles all devices on a bus
can consume, etc.  His interface allows me to deal with
garbage like this in any way I like.
The ix86 implementation can do things your way, for example.
And everyone is happy :-)
