Hi Andrew,
The following patchset fixes a few issues found when trying out
different configuration settings on AVR32. It also adds a reasonable
default configuration for the AT32STK1002 board to make it easier
for people to build a working kernel for themselves.
I should also mention that I may be less responsive the next two
weeks as I leave for vacation, but as long as you Cc linux-kernel,
I'll pick it up (I won't be able to respond to stuff sent to
hskinnemoen@atmel.com as our VPN setup is completely broken.)
Thanks,
Haavard
