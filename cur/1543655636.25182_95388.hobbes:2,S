Hi,
I'm getting a "bio too big" error with 2.5.50.  I've got a 330G lvm2
partition formatted with ext3 using the -T largefile4 parameter. 
Everything seems ok at first, but any sort of access will die very
unhappily with said error messsage after about 10 seconds of operation
or so.  The only google search results are the patch submission.  Eeek.
Wil
