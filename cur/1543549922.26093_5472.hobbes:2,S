I am using 3com 574 pcmica ethernet. It reports the link status on start
up and it reports "lost link" if I pull out the cable.
On start up:
..........................................................................
Sep 25 11:21:08 localhost cardmgr[209]: executing: './network start
eth0'
Sep 25 11:21:08 localhost pumpd[6596]: starting at (uptime 7 days,
20:30:29) Mon Sep 25 11:21:08 2000
Sep 25 11:21:10 localhost kernel: eth0: found link beat
Sep 25 11:21:10 localhost kernel: eth0: autonegotiation complete:
100baseT-FD selected
.............................................................................
On pulling out the cable:
Sep 26 13:25:02 localhost kernel: eth0: lost link beat
Sep 26 13:25:02 localhost kernel: eth0: autonegotiation restarted
................................................................
This is kernel 2.2.x. I guess the drivers in pcmcia are the same as in
2.4.x, right? Any idea how to check for link status from user space even
if it is dependent on a specific adapter? (Pcmcia is of no interest to
me; for production and a serious lab testing pci cards would be used).

I cannot ifconfig the interface down if it is a part of a bonded device.
It reports "device is busy".
Thanks.
