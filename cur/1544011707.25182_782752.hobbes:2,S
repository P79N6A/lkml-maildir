applied to tip/x86/microcode, thanks Dmitry!
The fix looks right but somewhat intrusive in scope, so i'm a bit 
reluctant to push it towards .28 straight away - without having feedback 
in the bugzilla. If feedback is positive (the bug reported there goes away 
completely) we can cherry-pick it over into x86/urgent, ok? And in any 
case i've marked it as a -stable backport for .28.1.
