Of course not.  Instead you need to have a reasonable function for
determine how much randomness you can expect.  Perhaps you need to have
a trigger level: don't add randomness unless the prevous keystroke was
at least N ms separated, unless we have a high-resolution counter.
Why don't we use the TSC on other architectures that have them, e.g.
Alpha?

Yes, this is totally the right thing to do.

Note that if you're using an i820 you're using an x86, and the x86 has
the TSC so that sampling events can derive quite real randomness,
because the timing resolution is so high.
