Subject: 2.4.0-test8 and ssh (OpenSSH_2.1.1): error: socket: Address family not supported by protocol
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello,
I have just compiled the last version of the Linux kernel
(2.4.0-test8) and somehow I am no longer able to use ssh and get the
following message:
 Received disconnect: Command terminated on signal 11.
In /var/log/auth, I can find the following line:
sshd[4460]: error: socket: Address family not supported by protocol
Note that until now I have been using a 2.4.0-test7-preX with no
problem.
I do not know if the error I get is related to the following change
mentioned for test8-pre1:
    - socket() error code fix (EAFNOSUPPORT instead of EINVAL)
Thank you for your help and the great work on Linux,
Chris
