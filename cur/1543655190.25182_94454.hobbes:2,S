Besides the hunks posted recently, I encountered three problems/bugs:
a) Although your patch fixes the FB oddness for me, it makes booting
   without using framebuffer fail, IOW the kernel hangs:
   Video mode to be used for restore is f00
   BIOS-provided physical RAM map:
    BIOS-e820: 0000000000000000 - 00000000000a0000 (usable)
b) After returning from blanking mode (via APM) to normal mode, no
   character is drawn. Let's assume I'm using VIM when that happens:
   After putting any character to return from blank mode, the screen stays
   blanked apart from the cursor that _is_ shown. Now I'm able to move
   the cursor, and when the cursor encounters a character, this char
   is drawn (and keeps drawn). Though when I press Ctrl-L or when I go one line
   above to the current top-line (i.e. by forcing a redrawn), the
   whole screen is drawn properly.
c) instruction:          | produces:
   ======================|==================
   1. typing abc def     | $ abc def
                         |          ^ (<- cursor)
   2. going three chars  | $ abc def
      ro the left        |       ^
   3. pressing backspace | $ abcddef
                         |      ^
   4. pressing enter     | -bash: abcdef: command not found
                         |
HTH.
