Of course I'm aware. But what bad ones do you mean?

Can you remove modules from a running system, that
are compiled into the kernel? For instance the
Filesystem driver, that were used to boot and is
not longer needed because / has another filesystem
than
/initrd.

I seem to have misread here. I *don't* want to change
the kernel with tar, as you seem to assume. Thats why
I'm asking for an ld-script. I want to be able to
*extract* (READ-ONLY) modules from a kernelfile that
are compiled into this (not currently running) kernel
to insert them into the currently running kernel to
update it. And I want to do it *with* the current
module loader.

Of course it's done. You have 2 files: one staticaly
linked to run at install time, one binary archive
(descendent of tar) to install into the system.
If I could make the binary do double duty as install
archive, I could save 50% space. Thats a lot on a
floppy based install. And make no mistake: Even CDROM
(not all, I know!) boot from a floppy image.

I *wrote* that the first example has nothing to do
with
the kernel. It's only there because it's simpler.
And useful too.
