Hi,
I am sorry if this problem has been known. I got a flash disk. Kernel 2.6.7
can not know if the disk is in the lock mode so it still assumes that
write is enable and of course when write to disk it causes file system panic
and nothing written.
In 2.4.27 if my disk is locked, it is automatically detected and mount it as read-only
and this is an expected behavior.
Thank you very much for your time.
Steve Kieu
