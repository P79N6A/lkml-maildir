: Is the CPU load higher than normal?  Excluding I/O wait?
	No, ~30% system is pretty standard for this server. I have looked
just now (2.6.0-test7), and I have 33% system, about 50% nice,
and the rest is user, iowait and idle. Under 2.6.1-rc2 it was about 30%
system and the rest iowait, with small amount of nice and user.
However, the load may be different. It is hard to have any kind of
"fixed" load when you serve data over FTP, HTTP, rsync and do some
other minor tasks (updatedb, current/up2date server, ...).
	Do you still want the system profiling info?
