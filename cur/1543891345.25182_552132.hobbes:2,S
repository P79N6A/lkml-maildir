Well, it looks like a highres-timers problem or something
like that. So I can't really be handling that, as I have no
clue about this.
I suggest you also add Gary Zambrano <zambrano@broadcom.com>
here, as he is actually the maintainer of b44. Not me.
My role was just helping in debugging the issue, as I know
some details of b44.
