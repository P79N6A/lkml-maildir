I beg to differ. Most subsystems do have at least rudimentary
documentation. (I'm spoiled by the USB subsystem, of course. :-)

I am not asking for "full documentation". "Some bits" would amply
suffice. Documentation/isdn/INTERFACE, the interface description
for the "old" isdn4linux subsystem, is far from complete, either.
But it contains enough hints so that I knew where to start.

Usually, yes. But I find it unusually hard in this particular case.
In fact I have been trying to do that for two years now, without
getting anywhere. Reading code without a hint of what the authors
are trying to do is terribly time-consuming, to put it mildly.
Thanks,
