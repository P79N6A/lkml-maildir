   This sounds very useful. I'm porting a multithreaded app to Linux and
found core dumps to be basically useless. Now ideally, I'd like to be able
to see all thread states at crash time. However I guess the way threads
are implemented this isn't going to happen, since they're each a process?
Or am I wrong. It's actually quite important for a multithreaded app to
see the state other threads are in at some kind of fault incase it's a
resource locking issue. Anyway I'm sure what you've done will be better
than what was there before.
   I haven't tried the patch yet but I certainly will.
