   Now the dream would be detailed per spinlock counters,
   unfortunately the current spinlock declaration syntax makes it hard
   to name them (and for dynamic spinlocks embedded in other
   structures a different way would be needed anyways than to
   statically name the spinlocks - for them reading System.map doesn't
   work well neither). This means for named spinlock profiling it is
   needed to change all spinlock users :(:(. I believe for effective
   SMP tuning in 2.3 they are definitely needed though.
Some of this is handled in the debugging spinlock implementation on
some machines.  With a little hammering, and modifying the
spin_lock_init etc. callers, you could get the desired behavior I
believe.
