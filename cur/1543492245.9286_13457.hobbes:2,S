Whoops, figured this one out myself.  A few days ago, I deleted the source 
tree for 2.2.5, then re-untarr-gzipped it, forgetting about the command I 
added at the end of the make install section of the makefile to copy the 
.config to /boot/config - totally my fault.  (then, I made reference to you 
about what I added, without mentioning it first - totally stupid of me - blame 
it on lack of sleep or something)
Thanks, and sorry for the blunder.
