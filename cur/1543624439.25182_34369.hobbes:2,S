I'm still wondering whether it's a good idea to assume all color values (e.g.
fb_fillrect.color) are palette indices. This means you cannot draw a rectangle
with an arbitrary color using cfb_fillrect().
Furthermore this means that fillrect() and imageblit() (the color image case)
expect different formats: the former expects a palette index, the latter
expects the native frame buffer format (cfr. your comments in the code below).
The 17-entry (16 colors + 1 XOR mask) pseudo palette is actually something
related to the console, so I would not handle it in the low level drawing
routines, but in the frame buffer console layer. Of course the pseudo palette
still has to be initialized by the frame buffer device, since that is the part
that knows about the mapping from console palette indices to native pixel
values. This also means you'll have a pseudo palette for all modes, including
pseudocolor[*].
What do you think?
[*] Or set pseudo_palette to NULL, and use
      pixval = pseudo_palette ? pseudo_palette[idx] : idx;
    and
      xormask = pseudo_palette ? pseudo_palette[16] : 15;

Color images are not yet implemented?
