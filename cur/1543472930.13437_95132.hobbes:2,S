I'd like to thanks those who responded personally to me regarding the faux pas i
n my attempt to apply the 2.1.132 patch. I indeed have a UP box, and never thoug
ht to check the Makefile as I already knew I had SMP commented out. I wasn't awa
re of the change(s) in .132 regarding SMP and now I feel a little enlightened, a
lbeit foolish and a little sheepish as well. :)  
Thanks again
