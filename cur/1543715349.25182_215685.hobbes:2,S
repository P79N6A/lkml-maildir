I discovered why I thought the Mesa driver wasn't working.  It turns out 
that kscreensaver is broken.  If I use xscreensaver, or the screen saver 
starts from Gnome, or I run the OpenGL program stand-alone, everything 
works fine.  But if I use KDE's screen saver program or it starts 
automatically in KDE, OpenGL screen savers get all flickery, as if 
double-buffering had been disabled.
Apparently, this is a long out-standing bug in KDE.
The only bit of this that is not off-topic is that ATI's proprietary 
drivers are broken, because they don't get along with radeonfb.
