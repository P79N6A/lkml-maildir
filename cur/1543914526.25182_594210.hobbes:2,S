Subject: Wrappers to load bitmaps (Re: [PATCH] Improve ebitmap scanning)

Now I'm improving the performance to scan bitmap in SELinux,
with replacing its original bitmap implementation (ebitmap)
by common bitops like find_next_bit().
I posted a patch to replace them, however, it got a bit complex
bacause we had to translate u64 <--> unsigned long by myself
to adjust between the format of security policy and common bitops.
  
http://marc.info/?l=selinux&m=118956715414494&w=2
I have an idea to provide several wrapper functions to copy u64/u32
to/from unsigned long for each architecture.
Maybe, it will be defined as follows:
  int arraycpy_u64_to_ulong(u64 *src, unsigned long *dest, size_t len);
  int arraycpy_ulong_to_u64(unsigned long *src, u64 *dest, size_t len);
I believe this feature will help getting code simpler and reducing bugs
for any other subsystem, not only SELinux, which loads bitmaps from/to
userspace and handle them using common bitops.
Any comment please.
