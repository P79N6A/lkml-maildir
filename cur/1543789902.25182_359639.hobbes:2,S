If the migration is being done as part of moving a cpuset, or moving
a task to a different cpuset, then yes the cpuset code will change
the mems_allowed.
However I thought we were discussing the sys_migrate_pages() call
here.  Naked sys_migrate_pages() calls do not involve the cpuset code,
nor change the target tasks mems_allowed.
