This looks like the vm86 fault I described earlier. For some reason
vm86 mode writes part of its state out to userspace in its fault
handler and I can't find anything that guarantees that won't double
fault. Anyone?
It might be useful to know what video driver you're using and whether
or not you use Wine, Dosemu, or anything similar. Being able to
reproduce it easily would be handy too.
