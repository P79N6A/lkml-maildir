This patch is very crude but it is quite resistant to recursive faults
in do_exit(), survives the LTP hammering I've given it. The problem is
not knowing where in the previous path it broke down so I'd rather just
leave it lying around and try a graceful reset/power off. But if anyone
has a better suggestion than the msleep() I'm all ears but this area is
sensitive.
Where is that anonymous patch hot-line...
