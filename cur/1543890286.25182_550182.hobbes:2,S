Let's not get in that catfight again. That file has been demonstrated to 
be half too premature and half completely obsolete. He's asking for which 
things should he start generating and sending patches and expect them to 
not be ignored or angrily shot down. feature-removal-schedule.txt does not 
provide this information, again as has been demonstrated.
Of course, it would be great if it were accurate and -did- provide that 
information.
