> alsa - backport of 2.5.4 Advanced Linux Sound Architecture to
2.4.19pre2 (me)
How much does it differ from the official alsa patches for 2.4?
Can I use an oss and a alsa module together?
(If i want it now, i have to first load the alsa module, because
snd-pcm-oss module doesn't like real oss modules :((
Thanks,
