It's mostly userspace; the kernel is usually (hello drivers/ !) cautious
and uses slab.c's anti-internal fragmentation techniques for most structs.

I'm not sure what to make of this. The distinction and PTE vectoring
API (AFAICT) allows PTE's to map sub-PAGE_SIZE-sized (MMUPAGE_SIZE to
be exact) regions. Someone start screaming if I misread the patch.

Userspace is required to have >= 3GB of virtualspace, according to the
SVR4 i386 ABI spec. But we don't follow that strictly anyway.

I've heard the sizeof(mem_map) footprint is worse on 64-bit because
while PAGE_SIZE remains the same, but pointers double in size. This
would help a bit there, too.
