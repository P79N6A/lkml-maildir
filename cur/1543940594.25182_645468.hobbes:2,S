Oh, full-scale regression testing even? Nice idea...
Would optionally be even better if during hardware tests one could also
dig out some i82503-based card (or additional MII-less cards?)
since I didn't really make any effort yet to try to make them all
recognized/supported by my patch already (would have been out of scope anyway
since I have this single card only).
Thanks a lot,
Andreas Mohr
