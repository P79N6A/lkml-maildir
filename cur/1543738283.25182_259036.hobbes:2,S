The "$" is considered a garbage character by the sanity check.
(same as "\v", "\033", "\xff", and so on)

No, the /proc/*/wchan file is supposed to be used.
For some reason, stat() is failing. Here is the code:
  // next try the Linux 2.5.xx method
  if(!stat("/proc/self/wchan", &sbuf)){
    use_wchan_file = 1; // hack
    return 0;
  }
See what these commands tell you:
strace -o data -e trace=stat ps alx >> /dev/null ; grep self data
stat /proc/self/wchan
stat /proc/$$/wchan
stat /proc/self/
stat /proc/self

Here's an idea: if both name and number were provided
at the same time and I could get notified when a module
is loaded or unloaded, then I could cache the
number-to-name translation.
