The kernel, filesystem, and wiper code all have to support this
properly. Forgive my ignorance on the below; I've never really looked
into the lower levels of FS code.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but if I write a file, then shrink it, 
ext2 doesn't know where the space went, so a secure deletion utility 
can't overwrite it. If we're talking about files written by text 
editors, utilities like patch, and other such things, the application 
doing the shrinking doesn't know to wipe the data before shrinking. 
Is this a case for the (not working, AFAIK) "s" ext2fs file attribute?
It could probably be modified to overwrite the file with whatever
patterns are deemed best.
