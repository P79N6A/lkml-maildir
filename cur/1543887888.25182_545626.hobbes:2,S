With these two patches in combination, previously failing machines elm3b6 
(x86_64 on test.kernel.org) and a modern x86 built a kernel and booted 
correctly.
elm3b132 and elm3b132 (x86 numaq on test.kernel.org) built with these 
patches but silently fail on boot with no output via earlyprintk. 
According to test.kernel.org, this failure occurs with git-newsetup 
reverted so it is a separate problem.
Thanks
