ok, i see - this makes 100% sense. I'm wondering how intrusive such an
all-preemptive patchset is? There are some problems with per-CPU data
structures on SMP. Right now holding a spinlock means one can use
smp_processor_id() and rely on it staying constant in the critical
section. With a mutex in the same place all such assumptions would
break. Is there some automatic way to deal with these issues (or to at
least detect them reliably?).
