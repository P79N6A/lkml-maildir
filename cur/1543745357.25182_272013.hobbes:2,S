I have to agree with Dave - this is just a wierd solution.  I added 
arch_free_page to do arch-specific, invisible-to-the-generic-kernel things.
My intent may not be the be-all and end-all for this, but I think the semantics
you want to add to it are not that reasonable.
My gut reaction (without knowing your problem in any detail) would be that 
you need too add some more structure to whatever mechanism you have
so that the pages land in your allocator automatically, like a slab or a new
zone or something.
