Looks correct. However I am curious what this "i2c->id" is supposed to
represent, given that I2C devices do not have any form of ID as PCI or
USB devices have. No driver uses "MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE(i2c, ...)"
probably just because it doesn't make sense. So, rather than fixing
this, shouldn't we simply wipe out struct i2c_device_id? Greg, David?
