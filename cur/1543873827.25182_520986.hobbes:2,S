I don't think we can actually abuse i_size_read() in any sane manner
because the inode needs to be usable for anyone who just did open(2)
after revoke or whoever called frevoke(2).
What we could do is add a "I am revoked" flag to struct file which
blocks any future ->readpage, ->readpages, and ->direct_IO on the
file. Alternatively, we could change the ->f_mapping to point to an
address space that has "revoked address space" operations. Hmm.
