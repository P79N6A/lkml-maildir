Suggestion: for each macro name, do
	grep "macroname" patch
and if you see anything that looks even half-way suspicious, check it.
Here's a pipeline from hell which shows that you broke at least 
MADV_REMOVE (which has values 5-9 depending on architecture).
	sed -n '/^[-+].*define[ 	]*/
		{ s/.*define[ 	]*\([A-Za-z_0-9]*\).*/\1/ ; p}'
		patch  |
	sort -u |
	while read i
	do
		echo $i:
		grep "^[-+].*$i" patch
	done |
	less -S
Rule #1: use tools instead of eyeballs whenever you possibly can. Humans 
are bad at noticing changes like this.
