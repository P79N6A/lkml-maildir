OK, I think I get it.  Your point is that SCSI is similar in complexity
to STP so the fact that SCSI exists says that drives with STP (and
perhaps Linux) are pretty much a done deal.  Is that it?  If so, excuse
my slow brain, it takes me a while sometimes.
It's a good point, the only flaw is that SCSI drives are way more expensive
than IDE drives.  The question is if that is inherent or just mark up...
