The NAT/router box that seemed to have problems with FTP connection
tracking went into production a week ago. Since them it has been working
OK, at least there are no reports froms people on the internal network
complaining about their file downloads stalling or failing.
However, most of the users don't use the net heavily. I use the net a
lot every day, and have had no big problems so far, except from some
(random) combinations of browser and remote FTP server that make
directory listing not complete (although file downloads work OK).
So it seems the problem I was having was somewhere outside the linux
kernel inside the router. Sorry for any inconvenience :-)
