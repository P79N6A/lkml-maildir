Hello,
I am a relative newcomer to Linux and recently watching the kernel lists.
FWIW, I have a quad Pentium 100 HP netserver that will panic kernel 2.2.x
and 2.4.x (last checked with 2.4 test9) when bios APIC is turned on.  I
know this is not related to what your talking about, and that these are
probably rare systems, but I thought I would let you know.
Thanks,
Bruce H.

Seems reasonable enough.
