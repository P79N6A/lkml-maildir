	It's getting the type from the OS header files (in this case
	the Linux types.h), right?
	This suggests that one could make a kernel with 32-bit 
	UIDs and GIDs, rebuild glibc on it (and possibly have to
	fix bugs some applications that were linked against glibc)
	and build a Linux system with support for the larger UID 
	space.
	I'll ask on the kernel list regarding the size/scope of 
	such a change.  Would it require changes to various
	filesystems?  (I presume so, since they are storing UIDs 
	and GIDs in all of the inodes which seem to be a pretty 
	densely packed struct.  I guess that shifting things
	around in the inode my cause sector/cluster alignment
	problems).  
	Obviously any statically linked utilities the depended 
	on these structures would also have to be rebuilt.
	I discussed this at least once before (on a mailing list
	newsgroup or somewhere) and came away with the impression
	that it is a pretty big project.  
	I've moved this discussion to the kernel list (moving
	Ulrich and M off to a Bcc: line so they will not be
	inundated with responses therefrom).  I'll summarize
	any fruits of that thread back to both of them.
	So, LKern-at-large:
	How big a project would this be?  Are larger UIDs supported
	under any version of Linux?  How much would be break if we
	tried it?  Why do we currently use only 16-bits? Do the 
	UID/GIDs pack into some other struct better that way?  
	Does it have to do with real UID vs effective UID?
	TIA for any comments.
