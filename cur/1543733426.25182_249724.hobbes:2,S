Think about unloading frame buffers or PCI devices with multiple
functions and multiple drivers. I agree the drivers definitely want
fixing where appropriate. I'm not sure your approach is safe (although a
debug printk would work wonders perhaps ?)
Another question: When I suggested doing exactly this for kexec I got
flamed by people claiming that disabling bus mastering isnt a defined
operation only enabling it. I'm still unconvinced by their protestations
but wonder what the PCI gurus can answer here.
