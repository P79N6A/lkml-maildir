It's exactly under these conditions that I discovered the problem. None
of the interface was usable by the bonding driver, although one of them
was properly connected !

IMHO, saying "most net drivers" is unfair : tg3, tulip, 3c59x, starfire,
realtek, sis900, dl2k, pcnet32, and IIRC sunhme are OK. eepro100 is nearly
OK but has this annoying bug, and only older 10 Mbps drivers don't report
their status, often because the chip itself doesn't know.
