Language barrier, I think, or perhaps I was unclear. Please read that
as "4k stacks introduce no new stack bugs." And if we put wli's
unconditional interrupt stacks into the kernel, it's pretty obvious
that 8k stacks are at least as safe in that case as 4k stacks.
Given that there's actual, y'know, reports of people who can easily
crash a 4k+interrupt stacks kernel, and not an 8k one, I think the
current evidence speaks for itself.
The point remains that the burden of proof of the safety of the 4k
only option is upon those people who want to remove the 8k option.
