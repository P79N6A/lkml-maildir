Subject: 2.4.2-acXX hangs on boot if IrDA is in kernel

Hi Alan,
  tried as you suggested to config out IrDA and indeed the kernel boots.
 Even in -ac20 my Dell Latitude laptop hangs in the RH7.0 init sequence
  after printing the IRCOMM line. C-A-D doesn't do anything but I can use
  Magic Sysrq to reboot.
 I am available for further diagnostic investigation. Just in case, this
  is my IrDA h/w (booted into 2.4.3-pre4).
[root@princess /root]# findchip -v

 Thanks & ciao,
