Yes, since the klists have not yet been initialized.

We should fail registration (gracefully) of all devices/drivers which
specify a bus that is !NULL but has not been registered. Unfortunately,
I don't see an easy way to do this.
However, we can fail the registration of devices that specify a parent
that is !NULL but not yet added to the tree. This catches platform
devices registering before platform_bus_type (since platform_bus is not
registered then), similar for other bus types like iucv.
(Unfortunately, not drivers...)

Force parent devices to be registered before their children. Otherwise we'll
oops when creating the child's sysfs directory.
