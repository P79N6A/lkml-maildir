hey,
	Apologies if this  has been brought up before...
	are there any known issues with programs like top/free etc displaying
	memory etc used incorrectly... this bis the output from one of our machines
	with dual pIII 450's and 5½2MB ram...
	roady@matrix:~$ free
   			 total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:        513548     509416       4132          0      38384 		15764

	 roady@matrix:~$ 
	this just seems wrong as this machine *isnt doing anything*. Any pointers
	to something that may display correct information if this is broken,
	chunks of code etc...\
	cheers
	ben
