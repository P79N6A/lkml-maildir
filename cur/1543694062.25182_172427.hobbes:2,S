Many years ago we had the same problem with ext2: it did not change
ctime on rename, so GNU tar did not pick up the renamed files on
incremental backup.  Fortunately a few kernel versions later ext2
changed to the current behaviour (unfortunately I don't remember the
kernel version).
IIRC our sysadmin submitted a bug report for GNU tar at the time, and
got the answer that GNU tar would not change.
