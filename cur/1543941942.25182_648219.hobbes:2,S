Well some bits can be moved up.  Here's my grand plan which I plan
to implement once I get some time for it (or let someone else do
if they beat me):
 - generic_segment_checks goes to fs/read_write.c before caling into
   the filesystem
 - dito for vfs_check_frozen
 - generic_write_checks is a suitable helper already
 - dito for remove_suid
 - dito for file_update_time
 - after that there's not a whole lot left in generic_file_aio_write,
   except for direct I/O handling which will probably be very fs-specific
   if you have your own buffered I/O code
generic_file_buffered_write is an almost trivial wrapper around what's
->perform_write in Nick's earlier patches and a helper for the syncing
activity.
