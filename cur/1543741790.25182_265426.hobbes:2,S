Hmm, I can't seem to find the relevant code.  Where is it?

Heh.  right.

Right, but the case in question is the one where we don't have a local IP
specified:
	if (!np->local_ip) {
		rcu_read_lock();
		in_dev = __in_dev_get(ndev);
		if (!in_dev) {
			rcu_read_unlock();
			printk(KERN_ERR "%s: no IP address for %s, aborting\n",
			       np->name, np->dev_name);
			goto release;
		}
		np->local_ip = ntohl(in_dev->ifa_list->ifa_local);
		rcu_read_unlock();
		printk(KERN_INFO "%s: local IP %d.%d.%d.%d\n",
		       np->name, HIPQUAD(np->local_ip));
	}

Yes, that should do it.

mpm> Maybe. We should probably revisit the nfsroot code as well.
Right, just point me at it.
Here is a patch which should work.  I'll test today.
