Hello, 
	My webserver is under super heavy load (about 250 simultaneous connections at
any given time). I am very frequently getting:
'couldnt spawn child process erorrs' when cgi scripts are attempted to be ran,
and overall server speed is bogged down.
	I have already adjusted ND_OPEN and ND_FILES to increase file descriptors,
turned of all web logging (that helped for a few mins), but I think the
problem is with processes.. I was told that I need to hack the kernel to open
up allowable processes as well.. but I can not for the life of me find a doc
that sais how to do it for linux.
Here are my systems specs: 
P2-450mhz with 384megs of ram.
Output from Top:

If anyone knows how to increase the amount of processes PLEASE let me know.
Thanks in advance,
