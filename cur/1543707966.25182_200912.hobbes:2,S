I have tried to reproduce this locally (with 2.6 kernel btw).
make
make kernel/pid.s
rm kernel/pid.c
And as you tell, the .c file is checked out. But I can here that
also the .c file is used when compiling pid.o.
Care to provide a few more details, such as:
- Kernel version
- What file is was
- What SCM you are using (uses bk here)
- Full log of what is happening (off-list is fine)
