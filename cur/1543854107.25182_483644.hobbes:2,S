Hi Pavel,
Last patch in the series (patch 20)  already does that. That patch just
puts all the assembly at one place which everybody shares. 
I know it is bad to introduce and delete your own code, but I kept that
patch as last patch as all the other patches have got fair bit of testing
in RHEL kernels and I wanted to make sure that if last patch breaks something
problem can be isolated relatively easily.
Thanks
Vivek
