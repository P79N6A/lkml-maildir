Ooh. I forgot about POSIX. :o/
Here's the revised files
-- true.c --
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
int main(void)
{
	return exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}
-- true.c --
-- false.c --
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
int main(void)
{
	return exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
-- false.c --
Will this work? 
Cheers, 
Alex
