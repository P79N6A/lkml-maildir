Yes, as long it's the _compiler_ that's doing the effort. You
shouldn't need to annotate the source just to make the compiler shut
up. Once the compiler starts issuing enough false positives, it's time
to turn off that warning completely. Therefore, the only sane strategy
for a warning is to aim for zero false positives.
