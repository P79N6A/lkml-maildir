Hopefully none of the for_each_foo() loops are performance-critical - those
things are expensive.

for_each_present_cpu() presumably has the same problems.

A fair bit of that has been happening in recent weeks.
But yes, we should be protecting these things with rcu_read_lock() if
possible, lock_cpu_hotplug() otherwise.
(rcu_read_lock() might not be the appropriate name for this operation -
maybe it should be an open-coded preempt_disable().  Or some other suitably
named alias; dunno).
