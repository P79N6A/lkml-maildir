That's nice.  Remember, we used to have a lock in there, that's why the
code doesn't look that clean after it was removed.

This is the way to call kobject_get(), as the object we get after the
function returns is the one we can then safely use.

Think of it as, "now we can use this kobject, not the one before calling
kobject_get()".
