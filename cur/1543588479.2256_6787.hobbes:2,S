Subject: [PATCH] ppp_generic, kernel 2.4.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patch corrects a bug in CCP establishment which can result in a
major security hole.
The bug can cause PPP to NOT install and use a compressor  module for
sending,  even though the compressor is sucessfully negotiated by CCP.
Since encryption is sometimes implemented as a compressor module (e.g.
MPPE), this bug can cause PPP to send cleartext even though encryption
appears to be sucessfully negotiated.
The bug does not always show up--it depends on the order of CCP messages
exchanged during establishment, and therefore is not deterministic.
The specific problem is handling a sent or received CCP ConfReq. A sent
ConfReq should reset my decompressor; a received ConfReq should reset my
compressor. The original code had this logic exactly reversed.
Please forgive if I make a procedural error in submitting this patch;
I'm trying to follow the instructions in the FAQ but this is my first
time. The FAQ said to cc Linus and/or Alan Cox for security issues, so I
am doing that..
I am not currently subscribed to the list so please respond directly.
The patch is attached and also shown below.
