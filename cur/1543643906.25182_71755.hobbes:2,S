I am switching some computers for a buisness, I need to know if switching them from OS selector is safe, each computer has two primary partitions, the first vfat 14 gigabytes, the second 5 gig ext2/3, would disk defragmenter corrupt the boot loader? I can find no FAQ.
Cheers, Dean McEwan. Currently hacking KGI, which I don't understand, oh and ask me about OpenModemTalk...
