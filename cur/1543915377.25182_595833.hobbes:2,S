The bnx2 firmware changes quite frequently.  A new driver quite often
requires new firmware to work correctly.  Splitting them up makes things
difficult for the user.
The firmware in tg3 is a lot more mature and I don't expect it to
change.  I think tg3 is better suited for using request_firmware().
