Subject: include/linux/autoconf.h missing from 2.4.13?

Okay,
This is really odd and I've double checked but for some reason a kernel that
I downloaded from
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/linux-2.4.13.tar.gz
 doesn't seem
to have the autoconf.h
Now the weird thing is that I downloaded this to another machine yesterday
from the same url, which seems to have the autoconf.h???  I'm a little
confused at the inconsistency and it worried me a little bit as possibly
being tampered with?
I would like to be cc'd on any ideas also as I'm not subscribed to the list.
And yes I just checked I just checked again so now I'm really sure that the
file is not in the tarball I downloaded.
Thanks,
- John
