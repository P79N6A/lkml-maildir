alexander-
socket inodes are not inserted into the hash table. i stated this
incorrectly yesterday.  they are created with get_empty_inode(), and their
i_sb field is initialized to NULL.  insert_hash_table is never used to
insert one of these into the inode hash.
they *are* however added to the inode_in_use list.  this is the real
problem, since this is the list that is scanned by free_inodes() to look
for freeable inodes.  a socket inode has a positive reference count
throughout its lifetime, and the in_use list is linear.
free_inodes() walks the in_use list looking for inodes with a zero
reference count. it's not clear to me how a zero reference count inode can
get onto the in_use list, though.  i would think that iput is careful
enough to move inodes whose reference count goes to zero to the unused
list.  all other references to the i_count field in the kernel i can find
are either reads or increments, except iput and iunique, which are
decrements, and get_empty_inode and get_new_inode, which set i_count to 1.
