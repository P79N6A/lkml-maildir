the blocking is inherent in the concept of "a queue of worklets handled by 
a single thread".
If a worklet is blocked then all other work performed by that thread is 
blocked as well. So by waiting on a piece of work in the queue, we wait 
for all prior work queued up there as well.
The only way to decouple that and to make them independent (and hence 
independently flushable) is to create more parallel flows of execution: 
i.e. by creating another thread (another workqueue).
