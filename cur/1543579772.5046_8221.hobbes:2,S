I currently use prepare_write/commit_write, but I think writepage
would have the same issue: When ext2 allocates a block, and has to
allocate from a new block group, it may do a synchronous read of the
new block group bitmap.  So before the writepage (or whatever) that
causes this completes, it has to wait for the read to get picked by
the elevator, the seek for the read, etc.  By the time it gets back to
writing normally, I've buffered a couple of MB of data.
But I do have a workaround for the ext2 issue.

Point taken, though the kmap needed before prepare_write is much less
significant than the kmap I need to do before copying data into the
page.

I'm going to see if the one-page-kmapped approach makes a measurable
difference.
I'd still like to know what the basis for the current kmap limit
setting is.
