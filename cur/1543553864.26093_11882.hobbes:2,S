Good afternoon, Michael,
	(The linux-kernel mailing list is not really the best place for
userspace issues.  You should probably use the ipmasq list for future
questions.  See 
http://netfilter.kernelnotes.org/ipchains/
 for the
ipchains homepage and 
http://ipmasq.cjb.net
 for info on that list.)

	One other possibility is to make sure that all of your dns rules
are at the top of your firewall, and that those dns rules only use ip
addresses and networks ("-d 12.13.14.15" as opposed to "-d
dns1.myisp.net").
	To check which rule(s) is/are giving you heartache, go to the top
of your firewall script and add "set -x" as the second line, just under
"#!/bin/bash".  Bash will show each line before it is executed.  The lines
that sit there for two minutes are probably the ones that are having
trouble with dns lookups.

	Oh, that's way too much memory for a firewall.  Mail me half of
it. ;-)
	Cheers,
