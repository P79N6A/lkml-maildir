POSIX never did require a working seekdir implementation. That
requirement came from our friends in the "Open Group":

Except for the fact that the NFS cookies are unsigned (and in the case
of NFSv3/v4 are 64-bit wide), whereas glibc gets confused when
confronted with 'negative' telldir values.
Hence the current Linux client's wrapping of the on-the-wire cookies. As
far as I can see, it is fully conformant with the spec, which has the
perfect "get out of jail free" card:
        "The definition of seekdir() and telldir() does not specify
        whether, when using these interfaces, a given directory entry
        will be seen at all, or more than once."
