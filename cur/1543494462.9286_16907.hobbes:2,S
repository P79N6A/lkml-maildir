Just out of curiosity, and because I'm not sure how it works, will
those messages affect sockets opened from masqed boxes?  I.e., I'm
using wget, whatever, on my internal net, and when my ppp connection
goes down (usually by accident), it would be nice for said message to
travel back to the client on the masq box.  I don't know why, but many
times applications fail to timeout (probably an application problem, but
still).  In the case of wget, if the ppp connection goes down on my
masq box, for some reason wget fails to realize that and just sits
waiting for more packets.
