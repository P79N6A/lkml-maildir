A variable no.  But the current iteration does allow specifying permissions
for files that are owned by the user.  The method to do so has been
changed from the current posting and may change again as their is some
debate as to how best express this.
So system policy can express something similar by doing
owner rw @{HOME}/.mozilla,
where @{HOME} is a user side variable that gets expanded into the
locations of the systems home directories.

yes you could do this, though I tend to want it just so I can control
which of my files firefox should be able to touch, without messing
up system policy.
