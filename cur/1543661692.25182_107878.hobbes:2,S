> Shouldn't kill and tkill be in one manpage that documents both?
Perhaps, but I think having them separate is better:
- killpg is also separate
- separate pages are easy: one can write "conforming to POSIX"
  in one, and "Linux specific" in the other. Merging gives a
  messy page
- the audiences will differ, I think
But I put a "SEE ALSO" in kill.2 referring to tkill.2.
