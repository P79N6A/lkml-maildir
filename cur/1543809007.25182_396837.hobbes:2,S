Not at all.
- You didn't have a system call interface.
- You didn't include your patches to proc.
- The fact that you missed several whole subsystems, (as did I)
  is a minor issue.
etc.
The patches we posted were a different subset of the whole, and as such
a clear comparison could not be made.

Then why isn't it done in OpenVZ?
I agree it can be done.  But an audit of the entire kernel is painful.

Again. I have not heard this assertion before, and I don't see it.
But let me ask a question that helps frame the issue.
Can I migrate all of the processes and (containers) on a real server
(not in a container) into a container on another machine without
any change in pids?
I believe that would require 3 on the inner most nested processes with
your approach.

You have 2 approaches, in your patch.  I have one approach that works
for everything.  Possibly I misunderstood my skimming, but usually
optimizations are only added when needed.

How the code will be maintained when discussing merging with the mainline
kernel is one of the most important issues to consider.

I wasn't trying to argue simply to lay it out as I saw it.
