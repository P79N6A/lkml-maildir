Subject: [PATCH] console palette fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patches fixes a problem several fbdev drivers where having. The patch
works great with vgacon as well. I have tested it with vgacon and fbdev
for several weeks and it works fine. Other people have tried the patch and
it worked for them. On calling sw->con_switch for fbdev drivers this could
change the video mode. For many types of video hardware the way the
palette is set depends on the video mode. In redraw_screen the palette was
being set before the video mode was changed. This was producing errors on
several drivers. This patch fixed this problem by setting the palette
after sw->con_switch was called. Thank you. 
Q: Why did they deprecate a.out support in linux?
A: Because a nasty coff is bad for your elf.
