Hi.
When i execute checkpatch version 0.24 of a file which contains the
following line:
  return a * b;
It complains with the following error message:
ERROR: space prohibited after that '*' (ctx:WxW).
I think that this may be a false error.
(maybe it fail on a rule which handles pointers declaration).
Thanks
Dotan
