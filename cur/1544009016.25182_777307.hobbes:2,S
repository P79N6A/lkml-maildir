The basic rule is that you're only supposed to increment the css
refcount if you have:
- a reference to a task in the cgroup (that is pinned via task_lock()
so it can't be moved away)
or
- an existing reference to the css

The reason I didn't do this is that I'd like to keep the ref counts
separate to make it possible to add/remove subsystems from a hiearchy
- if they're all mingled into a single refcount, it's impossible to
tell if a particular subsystem has refcounts.

The documentation is a little inaccurate - it's called when the cgroup
is removable. In the original cpusets this implied that there were no
tasks or children; in cgroups, a refcount can keep the group alive
too, so it's right to not call notify_on_release if there are
remaining refcounts.

Right, because it can't remove the dir if there are still refcounts.
Early in the development of cgroups I did have a css refcount scheme
similar to what you have, with tryget, etc, but still with separate
refcounts for each subsystem; I got rid of it since it seemed more
complicated than we needed at the time. But I'll see if I can dig it
up.
