Hello!

It is wrong. netlink_pid used not to be associated with process pids.
Kernel used pid just as a seed to calculate a random value to bind,
when user did not bind explicitly. It is equal to current->pid occasionally.
F.e. libnetlink from iproute autobinds and gets netlink_pid with
getsockname().
When user binds the socket himself, he was free to bind to any value,
including pid and tgid.
Actually, I remember one discussion. Herbert, wait a minute...
That's it: February 2005, Subject: [PATCH] Add audit uid to netlink credentials
We decided (or not?) that binding to anything but tgid and pid
must be prohibited by security reasons. Apaprently, the finding was lost.
