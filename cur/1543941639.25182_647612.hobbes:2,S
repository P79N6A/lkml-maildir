I still hope I don't need to take any lock in _range_start and that
losing coherency (w/o risking global memory corruption but only
risking temporary userland data corruption thanks to the page pin) is
ok for KVM.
If I would have to take a lock in _range_start like XPMEM is forced to
do (GRU is by far not forced to it, if it would switch to my #v5) then
it would be a problem.
