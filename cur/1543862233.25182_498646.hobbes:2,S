[ The discussed "ide: add ide_use_fast_pio() helper" patch doesn't fix it
  but it doesn't break anything either (it doesn't change the current
behavior). ]
It seems that it821x_tune_chipset() is buggy since it sends SET FEATURES
command even when in smart mode.  Shouldn't there be "don't tune" flag
in it812x_fixups() to tell it821x_tune_chipset() to not send SET FEATURES
commands?
