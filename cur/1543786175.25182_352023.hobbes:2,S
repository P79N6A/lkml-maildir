How do we know if it hasn't?  It wouldn't bug, you may just have a longer
latency on the higher priority process than what should be. It did happen
on my kernel, and the way I found that it did, was that I had a test in
the passing of ownership to make sure that the one that got the lock is
indeed the highest priority process. Without this check, we probably
would never know.
