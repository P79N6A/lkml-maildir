IIRC, when memory pressures start to become acute, the dcache gets suddenly
pruned, which accounts for the drop of ~300 in dentry_cache. Note that
pruning the dcache will free memory elsewhere as well, particularly inodes,
which aren't allocated using the slab allocator.

I'm don't think so, but I'm not an expert at this.
The thing that __really__ worries me is that skbuff_head_cache is >100,000.
It's currently *3* on my system, with a max of 125.
Joerg: what's running on this system? Do you see any odd network behaviour?

*nods* Deep weirdness seems to be occurring. I'd be happier if one of the
more experienced mm people poked their heads in here.
