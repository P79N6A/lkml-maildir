I suppose by complicated here, your referring to the gather semantics  
of the
pfm_read/write_pmds/pmcs calls. Many processors may have 100's of  
registers
(IA64, BG/P, SiCortex), some of which have different access times. So a
naive syscall of 'give me all the registers you've got' isn't going  
to cut it.
However, any additional simplicity (performance) we can squeeze out  
of this
particular primitive is a huge win as it sits in the critical path of  
the user
tools (unless one is sampling).

Performance and noise. See the earlier message about our user-land  
implementation versus kernel mode implementations. Any any useful  
granularity, you begin to seriously affect the counts with noise as  
well as dilate the run-time. But let's punt on this one until after  
we get the basics in. It's a non-essential feature at this point.

By custom here, I mean the ability to have the kernel take samples  
containing
more than just the IP, the PID and a bitmask of which registers  
overflowed at this
point. Myself and others have worked hard to get effective address  
sampling into the
hardware (there are registers that contain EA's of misses as well as  
branch mispredict
data on the PPC, IA64, Barcelona and SiCortex) that are handled  
through the use
of a format that gathers up that information at interrupt time for  
deposit into
the sample buffer. We are not wedded to Perfmon2's implementation of  
these formats, we
are however, wedded to having this information collected at interrupt  
time as the data
may change by the time you get back to user-mode. This hardware is  
not obscure any more,
it's the norm, as we've learned at thus simple aggregate counters,  
even those with precise
interrupt abilities, are not sufficient to satisfy all of our needs.

I love it when kernel folks refer to their own revenue streams
(and yes, we do, ask your VP of sales) and the needs of a user  
community as
"BS non-technical arguments".
But let's get back to basics here. We can sort that out over a beer  
sometime.
At this point, let's try and agree on the minimum set of
functionality acceptable for a first round of patches.
- per-CPU (system-wide) and per-thread 64-bit virtualized counters
- dispatch of interrupt on overflow via a signal
- first (self) and third-party (attach) semantics
- extensible to new lines within an architecture without repatching
   (By this I mean that through the use of modules that contain PMU
    description tables, i.e. patches don't have to be issued for  
every new rev
    of HW that Intel releases)
To be considered later:
- Sample buffers and formats
- Multiplexing (by event threshold and time slicing)
- fast-read support if the hardware supports it (mmap + user rdpmc)
I think(?) we are all clear now why oprofile is not sufficient, i.e.
simultaneous usage by non-root users, each with different counter  
configurations,
lack of read/write access  etc. Oprofile is however, a very important  
tool
and any initial set of functionality should allow for a very simple  
port to
each version of the infrastructure along the way. I'd happily port
incremental versions of PAPI to the patches, so the performance tools  
can be
accessible to the LKML community while testing/benchmarking the
patchset on a variety of architectures. If we can agree on the  
starting point,
we can move the discussion of the API to the Perfmon2 mailing list  
and with your
input, finally 'get it right' in terms of acceptance.
If there's anything we do have in common at the moment, it's momentum.
We (speaking for the HPC community/vendors again) are not in favor of  
useless bloat, every
TLB slot, mispredict, miss, timer-tick or pipeline bubble, we care  
about, kernel
space or not. It's precisely why this type of infrastructure has  
become so
vital to us over the years.
