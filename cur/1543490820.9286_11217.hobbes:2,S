You may have a good point.  Is this what you suggest:
 Modem 
 using
 special  <-> "serial.o" <-(1)-> pty/tty #1 <-(2)-+
 protocol                                         !
                                                  V
                                             My special
                                               modem
                                              "driver"
                                                  ^
 ppp,                                             !
 minicom, <------(4)-----> pty/tty #2 <----(3)----+
 whatever
If so, I just need to learn how to create a pty/tty pair, and how to make
the connections (1)..(4) in the figure above.  Any pointer to such info
is appreciated.  "man pty" gave me no help.
Yes, I'm completely ignorant in the pty/tty, field.  But I'll learn fast. ;-)
Thanks
Morten Norman
