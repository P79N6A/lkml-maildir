Subject: [patch 06/12] USB: Delete leftovers from bluetty driver
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch deletes the bluetooth.txt help file of the bluetty driver and
hands over its major device nodes for character devices to the RFCOMM TTY
implementation of the Bluetooth subsystem.

-INTRODUCTION
-
-  The USB Bluetooth driver supports any USB Bluetooth device.
-  It currently works well with the Linux USB Bluetooth stack from Axis 
-  (available at 
http://developer.axis.com/software/bluetooth/
 ) and 
-  has been rumored to work with other Linux USB Bluetooth stacks.
-
-
-CONFIGURATION
-
-  Currently the driver can handle up to 256 different USB Bluetooth 
-  devices at once. 
-
-  If you are not using devfs:
-    The major number that the driver uses is 216 so to use the driver,
-    create the following nodes:
-	mknod /dev/ttyUB0 c 216 0
-	mknod /dev/ttyUB1 c 216 1
-	mknod /dev/ttyUB2 c 216 2
-	mknod /dev/ttyUB3 c 216 3
-		.
-		.
-		.
-	mknod /dev/ttyUB254 c 216 254
-	mknod /dev/ttyUB255 c 216 255
-
-  If you are using devfs:
-    The devices supported by this driver will show up as
-    /dev/usb/ttub/{0,1,...}
-
-  When the device is connected and recognized by the driver, the driver
-  will print to the system log, which node the device has been bound to.
-
-
-CONTACT:
-
-  If anyone has any problems using this driver, please contact me, or 
-  join the Linux-USB mailing list (information on joining the mailing 
-  list, as well as a link to its searchable archive is at 
-  
http://www.linux-usb.org/
 )
