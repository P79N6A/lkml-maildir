2 things:
1) Why did you write a NEW message to the mailing list by
   choosing REPLY?  Was typing in: 
	"To: linux-kernel@vger.rutgers.edu"
   on a NEW message too difficult?  Don't know how to use cut and
   paste?
2) Why on earth did you QUOTE an ENTIRE MESSAGE DIGEST that is
   75k+?
Complete and total incompetance.  Please, get a clue.
