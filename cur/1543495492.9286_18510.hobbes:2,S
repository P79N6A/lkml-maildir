No, the patch doesn't do anything like that.  However, it seems to me
that if your system really is idle, there won't be any dirty buffers
to flush, and the disk will spin down anyway.  It also seems to me
that it is unsafe behavior to postpone flushing dirty buffers just
because the disk has spun down.  Finally, does anyone necessarily know
when the disk is spun down?  You'd need something in the disk driver,
and there doesn't seem to be anything like that.  The versions of
update that `know' this seem to do it by looking at /proc/interrupts,
which is unreliable.
