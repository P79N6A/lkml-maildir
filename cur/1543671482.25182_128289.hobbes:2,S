( You want to make me pay for the last question about swapcontext in our
old glibc environment, don't you ? ;)
If I read the specification correctly, the posix_spwan() interface will
not solve scalability problems due to huge file tables. If I read it
correctly, and if you have M files currently opened and you want to
keep/dup only three files, you have to drop (M-3) close actions plus 3 dup
actions. To solve such problem you'd need a default-all-closed option plus
3 dup actions. That inside the kernel will translate in a brand new file
table plus 3 links.
