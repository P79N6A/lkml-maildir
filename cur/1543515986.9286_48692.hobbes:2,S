I'm now running a patched 2.2.13 kernel with this patch (plus Andrea's
ext2 race patch from a week ago, and the raid0145 patch).  I also replaced
one of the drives in the array, based practially on a guess.  
The system has only been up 24 hours, but has withstood some high load,
with no recurrence of the problem.
I wish I had done these changes in a more controlled way (one at a time)  
so as to verify that one of them has made a difference, but I needed
stable and these three fixes (the U2W patch, the ext2 race patch, and the
disk replocement) all seemed only likely to increase my changes.
Thanks for your help, I'll let you know if anything else surfaces.
David
