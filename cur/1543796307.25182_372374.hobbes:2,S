It'll reclaim unused pagecache pages.  What effect that has on
idioticfs^Wtmpfs pages depends on the state of the pages.  If they're
attached to tmpfs inodes then they won't be reclaimed because they have no
backing store.  If they're attached to swapcache then they won't be
reclaimed because they have no superblock.
So I guess you got lucky.
