Then I guess Stevens did not know about setjmp/longjmp, or the solution
I use is wrong:
  1. you call sigsetjmp, and set a flag/store the jmpbuf address
  2. you check the buffer - it is empty
  3. a signal arrives - the handler sees the flag, clears it, calls siglongjmp
  4. control continues from point 2
  2b. you check the buffer - it is not empty
If select() returns, you clear the flag of course.
