I agree the numbers posted are nice, but I remain skeptical like Linus. 
Sure, the locking overhead is nearly gone in the profiled function where
RCU is used.  But the overhead has just been _moved_ to wherever the RCU
work is now done.  Any benchmark needs to include the damage done there,
too.
I also balk at implicit locking...
