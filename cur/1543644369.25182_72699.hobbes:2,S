sorry - LTT just uses a global lock - but to do so it must disable
interrupts.  This is not a cheap operation.  With lockless code you do not
need to disable interrrupts (or grab a lock) -> many less cycles.

If 2 cpus ping-pong back and forth there will be significant cache cost -
true, but the cost of having to acquire the lock (which also ping-pongs)
and disabling the interrupts, adds even more.  The additional cache line
ping pong for the lock (latency probably won't be hidden in fetching the
trace buffer data) plus the disabling interrupts still more than doubles
the cost.
