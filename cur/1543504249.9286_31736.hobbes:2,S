I think this breaks down into two main questions:
How do the different pthread implementations differ in how they determine 
thread identity?
WRT linuxthreads specifically, are there any tricks that can be used to 
multi-thread an application who's initial thread uses more than just the 
default application stack?
Explanation: 
I'm working on an application (VisualWorks Smalltalk virtual machine) that I 
ported to Linux.  The virtual machine("engine") uses 2 stacks:  the 
application stack (C stack) for execution of compiled C code, and a Smalltalk 
stack on which Smalltalk bytecodes are jit compiled and executed.  This 
architecture has been in use for over a decade in industrial settings.....  
The Smalltalk stack is located just above the process's data segment in 
memory, so it's real far from the C stack...
We have a threaded api (THAPI) that allows programmers to thread off C library 
calls (from shared C libs--used for database and socket accesses mostly).  The 
first call to pthread_create() doesn't happen until the programmer spawns off 
their first threaded C api call....
The system runs properly under ADUX, Solaris, HPUX 11, etc...  It appeared to 
run properly under the linuxthreads implementation used in glibc 2.0.7...
What we've found (after running against glibc 2.1.1) is that the linuxthreads 
implementation seems to assume that the "original process" (the one destined 
to become __pthread_initial_thread) executes on only one stack, and that it is 
the C stack.  The problem is that thread identity is determined by comparing 
the current %esp to the addresses of the existing threads....  So, if the 
engine is running jit code on the Smalltalk stack and receives a signal, the 
while loop in __pthread_find_self() flies off the end of the __pthread_handles 
array and ends up returning the address of the __pthread_handles array which 
is promptly written to (__pthread_handles[2] and __pthread_handles[5] are 
seriously damaged).
Since I don't happen to have access to the source for any of the systems 
except for Linux ;-) I'm now left guessing:  How do HPUX/Solaris/ADUX 
determine thread identity that doesn't depend on the value of the stack 
pointer?
I'm interested in fixing this problem, but the linuxthreads implementation is 
the only one I've seen the source to, so it's the only one I fully understand. 
 We've tossed around several potential solutions, but they all rely upon each 
thread having it's own PID, which is apparently a quality of linuxthreads that 
is in contention??
Any thoughts on this? 
TIA-pete
