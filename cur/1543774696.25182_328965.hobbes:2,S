This is not a mount bug, but a kernel-bug. umask=nnn is passed along other
user-flags to the mount syscall as a string, and the kernel-filesystem driver
parses the string and denies the syscall if a syntax-error occures. Not all
filesystems supports umask, so umask is not sent unless spesified. If the mount
man-page claims that umask is defaulted to the current shell umask setting, the
kernel-driver needs to take this into account when umask isn't found in the
string it receives from user-space. Just my 5 cent about this bug
