What are you trying to dump?  is it a multi-thread group app,
not a "simple" app?  I ask because of this (I'm looking at 2.6.21-rc6)
<mm_users> reference (not that I know what that is):
	if (!pid_in_pattern
            && (core_uses_pid || atomic_read(&current->mm->mm_users) != 1)) {
		rc = snprintf(out_ptr, out_end - out_ptr,
			      ".%d", current->tgid);
		if (rc > out_end - out_ptr)
			goto out;
		out_ptr += rc;
	}
