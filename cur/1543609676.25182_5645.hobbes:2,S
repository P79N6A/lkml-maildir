Subject: [PATCH] {double,triple}_down() in fs.h
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2001/11/13/225

This time I've read SubmittingPatches and tried to follow the rules,
especially the one saying that a patch shouldn't be sent as an attachment.
The code of triple_down() looked ugly and complicated, but I found that it
just sorted the semaphores and down()ed them. So I rewrote the code making
it simpler and more efficient.
The patch was made w.r.t 2.4.14.
