I've been working on a CPU and memory efficient reverse
mapping patch for Linux, one which will allow us to do
a bunch of optimisations for later on (infrastructure)
and has as its short-term benefit the potential for
better page aging.
It seems the balancing FreeBSD does (up aging +3, down
aging -1, inactive list in LRU order as extra stage) is
working nicely on my laptop now, but I don't think I'll
be releasing that as part of the patch ...
