Yes I puzzled over that too. Maybe they meant the MSR CPUID bits, but most likely
it was a mistake by the tech writer.
Yes I think you have to. Only checking vendor/family should be fine though -- i am not
aware of performance counter variations between models.
Perhaps add a force argument again that disables the family check too.

Well K8.
K7 has a different one. But ok. I think you don't try to support K7 at all
currently (it has the same register format as K8, but the list of counters
is different)
