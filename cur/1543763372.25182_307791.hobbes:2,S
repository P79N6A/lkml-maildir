Subject: [2.6 patch] let SERIAL_JSM depend on PCI
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/3/31/269

Compiling SERIAL_JSM with PCI=n results in the following compile error:
<--  snip  -->
...
  LD      .tmp_vmlinux1
drivers/built-in.o(.text+0x132800): In function `jsm_remove_one':
: undefined reference to `pci_release_regions'
make: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
<--  snip  -->
Since this driver is only for PCi boards, this patch adds a dependency 
on PCI.
Since I noticed that the Kconfig entry used whitespace instead of tabs, 
I corrected this, too.
