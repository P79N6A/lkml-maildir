Hello
In 2.45.47 and 2.5.46 (at least) did not try any other am I not able to 
serve files bigger than 255 bytes by apache2 from nfs mounted directory. 
The local files are served correctly.
The server is on 2.4.18. When I use the 2.4 also on client everything 
works. When the content of the page is CGI generated then the size is 
not limited like this.
Both client and server are x86 (athlon)
kernel compiled with: gcc version 2.95.4 20011002 (Debian prerelease)
sendfile() bug ??
Any ideas
Richard Bouska
