Interesting, but how about adjust this parameter like below instead of
adding new control knob ?(this kind of knob is not easy to use.)

                struct writeback_control wbc = {
                        .bdi            = bdi,
                        .sync_mode      = WB_SYNC_NONE,
                        .older_than_this = NULL,
                        .nr_to_write    = 0,
                        .range_cyclic   = 1,
                };
<snip>
                if (nr_reclaimable) {
			/* Just do what I can do */
			dirty_pages_on_device = count_dirty_pages_on_device_limited(bdi, writechunk);
			wbc.nr_to_write = dirty_pages_on_device.
			writeback_inodes(&wbc);
 
==
count_dirty_pages_on_device_limited(bdi, writechunk) above returns 
dirty pages on bdi. if # of dirty_pages on bdi is larger than writechunk,
just returns writechunk.
