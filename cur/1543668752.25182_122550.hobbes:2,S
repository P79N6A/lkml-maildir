Using CONFIG_ without explicitly including config.h is a bad idea.
But the ifdef is unessecary anyway, no one is hurt by having this
struct defintion in the non-numa case.  Also I wonder how you can have
a copyright on a single trivial struct defintion :)  What about just
moving it to mmzone.h, btw?

Use <linux/string.h> instead.

The cast is superflous.

This check is just horrible.  Please describe what kind of mappings
this doesn't work for and why and add a VM_ flag for those that
support memory binding.

You don't need to initialize this at all.
