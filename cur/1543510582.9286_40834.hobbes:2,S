If it's just a sanity check then it's probably reasonable to make it
42Mhz (83/2 being 41.5). Some boards do 133 but leave the PCI bus at
FSB/3 (i.e 44) but I doubt any system will run like that. It may even
be worth adding a check that it's over 25Mhz.
If it's intended to warn/stop overclockers then it should need the
code to be manually changed.
