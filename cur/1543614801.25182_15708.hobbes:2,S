* make dep is only run once
Personally, I don't see this as a big problem.  Just tell people to 
always run "make oldconfig && make dep" after patching the kernel 
and if they can't read, too bad.  I usually compile a kernel a lot 
more often than I add include files.  Since I'm quite impatient
I often do "make SUBDIRS=drivers/mtd/maps modules" just so that the
compile will go faster, so having to do dependency checking each time
I want to compile feels like an unfortunate tradeoff to me.
* The generated dependencies are absolute
That dependencies are absolute is also not a thing that has bothered me 
too much, it's always possible to run "make dep" after moving a tree, 
on the other hand, I don't use NFS a lot anymore, so I can see it being 
a problem in other environments.
