   wouldn't you rather know of the breakage sooner rather
   than later?
It means I have to track multiple source trees, no thanks.
I have enough trouble keeping up with what is actually
in Linus's tree.
   Recall when some random idiot broke sparc64 by mucking with 
   free_area_init_node? Those changes had been sitting in -mm tree
   for a while ;-) (and yes, that was me).
When they get merged I'll deal with the carnage.
