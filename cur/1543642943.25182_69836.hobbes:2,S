Subject: Fix for promise RAID controllers not working as IDE controllers in 2.4.19
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

When an a promise raid 20267 (and probably others) is used as an IDE device
in 2.4.19 it won't detect using the non-raid driver as it would in 2.4.18.
(So it can be used as a high performance ide controller).
The problem lies in the addition of some ifdefs checking the status of
CONFIG_PDC202XX_FORCE in ide-pci.c.  On line 672 an ifdef needed to be
changed
to an ifndef, a bug found way back in RC2, but when it was changed the ifdef
on line 405 got changed instead.
To get everthing working properly change
#ifndef CONFIG_PDC202XX_FORCE
on line 405 to
#ifdef CONFIG_PDC202XX_FORCE
and change
#ifdef CONFIG_PDC202XX_FORCE
on line 672 to
#ifdef CONFIG_PDC202XX_FORCE
I'd quote the origional posts by my entire network just went down.
