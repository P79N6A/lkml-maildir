You can also just copy and paste into Evolution as long as 'Preformat'
is set.  I just use 'diff -Nru foo bar | xclip'.  The problem is that
'Preformat' is a property of a given text range in the message; there is
no way to set 'Preformat' for all input.  So, if you paste with the
mouse and you don't hit the cursor exactly, Evolution will use 'Normal'
style and mangle the text.
It would be better if you could right click anywhere in the message and
have a 'Paste as preformatted' option.
Anyway this is OT, so LKML should be removed from any followups.
