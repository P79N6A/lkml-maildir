as usual. This release has two significant changes :
o We got the task release stuff horribly wrong for CLONE_DETACHED tasks
as used by nptl, leading to instant oopsen. I think I have fixed this.
One drawback is that the do_exit()-related code is now an oprofile blind
spot, but I can't see a better solution
o Use _raw forms for the spinlock we sleep whilst holding to avoid
CONFIG_PREEMPT complaining. I have lightly tested preempt on SMP with
the new patch, and it seems to work
