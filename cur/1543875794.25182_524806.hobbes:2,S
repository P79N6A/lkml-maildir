Still happens after having added just-published RSDL fixup patch and
reinstalled resulting kernel package.
.config diff between -rc4-mm1 and -rc5-mm1 is negligible.
Interesting items in current .config:
CONFIG_SWAP_PREFETCH=y
CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED=y
CONFIG_RT_MUTEXES=y
CONFIG_TICK_ONESHOT=y
CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS=y
CONFIG_PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY=y
CONFIG_X86_UP_APIC=y
CONFIG_X86_UP_IOAPIC=y
CONFIG_X86_LOCAL_APIC=y
CONFIG_X86_IO_APIC=y
CONFIG_ADAPTIVE_READAHEAD=y
CONFIG_HZ=250
CONFIG_X86_PM_TIMER=y
# CONFIG_CPU_IDLE is not set
CONFIG_PNP=y
CONFIG_PNPACPI=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_LOOP=m
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_CRYPTOLOOP=m
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEACPI=y
CONFIG_RTC=y
Thanks,
