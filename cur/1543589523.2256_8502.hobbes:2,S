I think it started in 2.2.19pre10. I can reproduce the hang on pre10, 
quite easily, but I couldn't reproduce it on pre5, pre7 and pre9. I'll try 
a few other pre versions, just to make sure.
One of the things that are different between pre10 and the others is NFS:
the client is broken in all versions except pre10. I'm not sure how much 
it matters, since I wasn't pounding on NFS. Anyway, that's why I want to 
try a few other kernels -- maybe it does matter after all.
Thanks,
Ion
