Someone kept saying that tbird would work and I kept asking how.
What I finally got was:
a.  enable html-formatted email (unintuirive, I had disabled it)
b.  for the body text, select Fixed Width
c.  copy-and-paste the patch
I tested it one time and it worked.
But as long as Andrew accepts text/plain attachments, that
works for him.  Makes it difficult to review them in some
mail clients...
