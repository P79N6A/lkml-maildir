Ok, here's a patch that just applies the weaker 128-byte alignment
constraint.
Andrew, please apply
The PPC64 ABI requires the stack to be 128 byte aligned (and that can
become important if AltiVec registers are saved there).  In the
kernel, that's usually dealt with by the fact that the stack has a
page more-or-less to itself.  However, the emergency stacks (used in
SMP bringup and when we detect a bad stack pointer) aren't necessarily
page aligned, or anything aligned for that matter.  This patch applies
the necessary alignement constraint to them.
