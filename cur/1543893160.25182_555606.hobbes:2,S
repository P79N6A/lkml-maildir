Subject: 2.6.22-rc regression: smartctl does not work with SATA disk

The command 'smartctl -a /dev/sdb' fails with 2.6.22-rc4 kernel. The 
disk /dev/sdb is a SATA disk. The command does work still with a real SCSI 
disk.
The computer has Athlon64 X2 and it is running x86_64 SMP kernel. The 
chipset is Nvidia CK804 and the sata_nv driver is used.
The following output from 'smartctl -a -r ioctl,1 /dev/sdb' tells the disk 
details and shows where the regression is:

This is smartctl from cvs a few days ago but the smartctl shipping with 
SuSE 10.2 fails in the same way.
I ran 'git bisect' and it suggests that the problem was introduced by
1e999736cafdffc374f22eed37b291129ef82e4e is first bad commit
commit 1e999736cafdffc374f22eed37b291129ef82e4e

    libata: HPA support
i.e., before 2.6.22-rc1. At this point I find best to leave the problem to 
experts.
