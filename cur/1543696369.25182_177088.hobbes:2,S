Subject: libata testing on new machine with ICH5 and PDC20318

I'm building a new server to go into a colo facility in about six weeks; 
the machine will have an Intel motherboard with an ICH5R (although I 
won't use the RAID features) and a Promise SATA150 TX4 (no RAID 
support). All six SATA ports will have Seagate 160GB Barracuda drives 
attached, and I plan on using software RAID-5 and LVM2 on top of the array.
I will be building the system using 2.6.0-test9, so will be using libata 
to drive the disks. If there's anything I can help with 
debugging/testing the ICH and/or Promise SATA drivers let me know... I 
see that recently Jeff posted a small patch for some SATA reset issues 
against -test9, so I'll certainly start out with that included.
