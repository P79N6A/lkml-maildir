: What needs access to these ipv6 symbols?  Do tell...
: 
For example, any module that performs packet manipulation for example in
netfilter hooks using IPv6. Currently such modules might be impossible to
do if they need to for example copy and resend packets (they also might
need to do route lookups). On 2.2 I guess in order to even detect that a
device (struct netdevice) uses IPv6 addresses we would have to export for
example ipv6_find_idev. On 2.4 we have the dev->ip6_ptr that is missing
from 2.2. I don't know if it can be detected in any other way currently in
2.2?
