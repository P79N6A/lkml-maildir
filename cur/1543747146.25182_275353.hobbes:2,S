The method is sound, I did some industrial control in a previous job and 
used a back-to-back timer in a similar way. Just before starting an 
operation I checked to see that it wasn't too soon and did a delay if so.
Depending on the path through the code, it may be easier to get right by 
just putting in the delay.
