The only vendor that ever implemented OOSTOREs was Centaur, and they
only did in the Winchip generation of the CPUs.  When they dropped it
from the C3, I asked whether they intended to bring it back, and the
answer was "extremely unlikely".
So we can probably just drop that "just in case" clause above, and just
do..
 #define smp_wmb()  barrier()
