The early quirks code only cares about the first south bridge,
it's essentially just a chipset detect. So secondaries do not 
matter.

Do they or do they not? Please be specific. 
Anyways AntiLinuxBIOS doesn't have ACPI and early-quirks.c is 80%+ ACPI
workarounds so they don't apply. The only exceptions are the VIA
detect or the the HT broadcast workaround. I suppose both do not
apply to these LB systems.
