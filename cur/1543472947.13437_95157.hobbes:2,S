While I've been following this thread for what seems to be years now,
something has struck me as being missed by most posters.
We all must remember that regardless of the literature, the United States
isn't a democracy[1]. We are a country ruled by corporations and
businesses. Our laws are in that direction was well as the apparent "will"
of our leaders.
Patents, copyrights, personal rights, intellectual rights: step back a
second a look at the laws that govern those concepts. There is a definate
pattern. They provide rights in favor of business, and reinforce personal
behavior patterns that benefit them.
Things aren't going to change here, I'm afraid. Though it goes against the
grain of my programming self, in this case we need to think solely about
'work arounds', not 'bug fixes' because we never will get our way.

Popularity != ability to lead.
G'day!
