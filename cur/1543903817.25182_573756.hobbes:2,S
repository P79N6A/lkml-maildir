Yes, that was the (2).

The (3) as I had originally written / meant was that multiple
instructions in a volatile asm would not get _individually_
interspersed with the rest of the code i.e. be emitted out
_consecutively_. I don't think we need any such guarantees for
the non-atomic variants of those operations, so it's good to
let the compiler have a free hand with what it wants to do,
and optimize/combine multiple bitops as necessary / possible,
which was the original intention.
