Which means that they won't be detected with the 2.4 mainline tree,
which appears to have 6.2.8 in 21-pre3.
FWIW, I can't run my NFS server without Justin's patches; it blows up
easily under load (even a simple resync of the RAID array running off it
causes all kinds of errors after only a few minutes).  This is a 7892.
With Justin's 6.2.24 driver it works great even when I beat the hell out
of it.
