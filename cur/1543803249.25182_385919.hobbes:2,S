Brian,
Is that 25%-50% percent of overall performance (e. g. transaction throughput), 
or is this a measurement of, say, DB process startup times, or what?   It 
seems to me that the impact of the shared page table patch would mostly be 
noticed at address space construction/destruction times, and for a big OLTP 
workload, the processes are probably built once and stay around forever, no?
If the performance improvement is in overall throughput, do you understand why 
the impact would be so large?   TLB reloads?   I don't understand why one 
would see that kind of overall performance improvement, but I could be 
overlooking something.   (Could very likely be overlooking something...:-) )
Oh, and yeah, was this an AMD x86_64 box or what?
