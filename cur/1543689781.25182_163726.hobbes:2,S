This is probably the same thing that Steve Hemminger posted about
yesterday:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=106270067411137&w=2
I posted a patch based on Sam Ravnborg's comments that might fix it,
but I haven't verified it yet... The patch is in this message:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=106272687506379&w=2
or it may be some other dependency.  I'll look into it.
Thanks,
~Randy
