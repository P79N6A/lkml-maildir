What motherboard is this again?  Perhaps your PCI bus is running just
a hair bit faster than 66MHz?  A similar issue was discovered with the
U320 controllers running at 133MHz PCI-X where some amount of delay is
required prior to accessing chip registers again after setting
CHIPRST.
The code was flipped so that the delay was acurate.  In PCI, you
are only guaranteed that the write has been flushed all the way to the
device by performing a read to that device.  I guess we'll just have to
hope that our write transaction isn't stalled.
I'll make a 6.2.7 <sigh> drop later today.
