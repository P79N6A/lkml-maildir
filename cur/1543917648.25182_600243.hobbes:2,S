Looks good.  If you have some sparse time left the dentry and vfsmnt
arguments of __d_path and d_path should probably be switched over
to a struct path aswell.  For about half of the callers that works
out easily because they have a struct file, and some need some
reshuffling (e.g. /proc/ symlink code or the dcookies that want to
store a struct path aswell)
