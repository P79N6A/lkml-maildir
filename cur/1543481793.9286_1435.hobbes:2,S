You are correct. I did make the mistake. Thank you for catching the mistake.
It IS partition magic that makes the changes to the partition type.
Although, Linux fdisk CAN be used to change the drive type as well. I've
done it perosnally so i know it works. (Unfortuately later on, the drive
crashed from a bad arm controller).
Once again, thanks for the keen eye. :-))
