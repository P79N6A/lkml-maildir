Hello Sam,
My intention is  to just understand whole  
process of making kernel module.
Actually I am working on one project in which I have
to port lots of 2.4 kernel module in 2.6 kernel.
So I thought lets first try to understand, what is
going behind KBUILD.
I also gone through  linux/Documentation/kbuild/ but
didn't get very much information.
Even after running it on Verbose Mode, I am not very
much clear.
Thanks
