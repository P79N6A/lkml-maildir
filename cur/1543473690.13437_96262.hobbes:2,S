ALSA isn't ready yet, as Jaroslav has pointed out (no working
sequencer, inadequate current H/W support). It will be soon, and I
intend to help by porting my WaveFront driver to ALSA once the
sequencer appears stable-ish. But I also want to disagree with your
next paragraph:

On the contrary. Its *exactly* the fact that there wasn't a good
*free* driver for the Turtle Beach WaveFront soundcards that made me
write one. I think that many of the potential device driver writing
community are of a similar bent: the existence of a proprietary
non-open-source driver acts as a stimulant to produce an open source
one so that we can all benefit. I also feel similarly about the use,
for example, of a DOS-boot-thru that uses some existing DOS utility to
configure a card: yes, its there and it works, but its also a great
reason for figuring out how to do it from Linux. Yes, not many people
think this way, but I'd wager many Linux device driver writers do.
