Hmmm, this is interesting. I am seeing kernels 2.2.7 and 2.2.9 hang under
network load. Can't ping.  2.2.5 has been stable for weeks, I have not
gotten a 2.2.7 or .9 kernel to last more than a couple of days. I did not
try 2.2.6 or .8 so I can not say if they have the problem. Dont know if
any of the keyboard stuff works, the systems are remote headless
web servers.
These machines are SMP P-II 450's with 320MB of RAM and Symbios 53C8XX
SCSI. Intel Pro 100+ ethernet adapters and that is about it, nothing
fancy.
