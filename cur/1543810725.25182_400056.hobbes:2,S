Yes. I'm saying that your mapping of the  NFSv4 DENY_WRITE share mode
into FMODE_EXEC will _only_ work for the specific combination
OPEN(READ,DENY_WRITE).
Basically, your proposal makes heavy assumptions on what clients will
want to use the share modes for, and will misbehave badly for any client
that breaks those assumptions.
