Interesting.  I've been compiling my own kernels for quite some time and 
have never had a boot device end up anywhere except where I thought it 
should.  This includes during the 2.5 craziness when parts of ide support 
was rewritten at least twice.

Certainly this is the best advice.  Not only support for the hardware, but 
also ext3 journalling as well as ext2 support.  I think it may be possible 
to end up with ext2 builtin but ext3 journalling as modular.
