Hmm? I still don't see why you can't introduce spin_lock_irqsave/restore()
in pps_event() around the access to pps_source.

Nopes, it's not about protecting code from each other, you're needlessly
complicating things. Locking is pretty simple, really -- any shared data,
that can be concurrently accessed by multiple threads (or from interrupts)
must be protected with a lock. Note that *data* is protected by a lock,
and not "code" that handles it (well, this is the kind of behaviour most
cases need, at least, including yours).
So here we're introducing the lock to protect *pps_source*, and not keep
*threads* of execution from stepping over each other. So, simply, just
ensure you grab the lock whenever you want to start accessing the shared
data, and release it when you're done.
The _irqsave/restore() variants are required because (say) one of the
syscalls executing in process context grabs the spinlock. Then, before it
has released it, it gets interrupted and pps_event() begins executing.
Now pps_event() also wants to grab the lock, but the syscall already
has it, so will continue spinning and deadlock!

What I meant is that you could make it a proper spin_lock() --
or spin_lock_irqsave(), actually -- instead of the _trylock_ variant
that it currently is.
I think you're unnecessarily worrying about contention here -- you can
have multiple locks (one for the list, and separate ones for your sources)
if you're really worrying about contention -- or probably rwlocks. But
really, rwlocks would end up being *slower* than spinlocks, unless the
contention is really heavy and it helps to keep multiple readers in the
critical section. But frankly, with at max a few (I'd expect generally
one) PPS sources ever to be connected / registered with teh system, and
just one-pulse-per-second, I don't see why any contention is ever gonna
happen.
