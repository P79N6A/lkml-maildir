Please explain. As far as I can see, it is fairly simple, but good
enough. pm_message_t.flags indicating it is runtime suspend would be
nice, but I do not think it is broken.

Nobody fixed it in a year, so apparently it is a lot of work.

0 drivers support > 2 states. So it is indeed very little benefit.

But band-aid is apparently neccessary unless you want drivers to see
invalid values.

Without "band aids", you'll get BUG()s all over the kernel.

Just because you claim they exist does not mean they exist.

Userspace can't know that driver does not support D3 on this
particular hardware version because of hardware problems... or simply
because it is not yet implemented.
