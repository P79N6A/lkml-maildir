I think you're talking about different locks. Squid is harmed by the
inode semaphore on the directory and possibly the super block lock, Al 
is talking about the SMP BKL. On UP it should make no difference 
at all. If the BKL lock was to blame for squid multiple directories would
not have helped (and I guess it was on UP anyways)
