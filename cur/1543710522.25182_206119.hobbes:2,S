Well, I tried several variatons of following rule:
SYSFS{dev}="22:64", KERNEL="hdd", NAME{all_partitions}="hdd%n"
But no partitions popped up. I searched a bit in lkml and some time ago, 
there was a thread about a jaz drive with the same problem. It rather 
seems udev doesn't see the partitions appearing or I do something wrong.
For the time being I just put this into my local.start:
mknod -m 660 /dev/hdd4 b 22 68
chown root:disk hdd4
If you are sure udev should hanlde it, it would be nice if you kick me a 
bit further into the right direction...

PS:udevinfo -a -p /sys/block/hdd/
udevinfo starts with the device the node belongs to and then walks up the
device chain to print for every device found all possibly useful attributes
in the udev key format.
Only attributes within one device section may be used in a rule to match the
device for which the node will be created.
