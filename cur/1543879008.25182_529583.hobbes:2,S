for capturing usually OSS or alsa is used, you might have a look at
the em28xx code and search for audio (VIDIOC_G_AUDIO, VIDIOC_S_AUDIO)
there are drawbacks at the moment that you usually don't know what
audio device belongs to your TV card if you want to capture audio
digitally without looking at your dmesg or reading the individual
description of the created audio device (userspace applications
usually don't know about that and you have to set up the soundcard -
tvtuner bridge manually)
