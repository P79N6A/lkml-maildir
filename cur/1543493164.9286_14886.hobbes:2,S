Your diagnosis is entirely correct. The answer, I think, is to reset
the fsuid/fsgid to that recorded in the file structure, since that is
set to the value of the fsuid/fsgid that was used when the file was
opened.
The appended patch (based on what I'm now using in the NFSv3 patches) 
should be correct for linux-2.2.5. It's untested but (in the words of
Linus) 'obviously correct'...
Cheers,
