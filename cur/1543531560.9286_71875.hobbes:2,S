So get them to fix that relay or change ISPs.

They need no authorisation to collect and publish the data. Any blocking
that takes place is authorised by the admins of the systems that use the

I'm not sure of the numbers, but my guess would be several hundred
systems use ORBS.

Send mail to ORBS thanking them for alerting you to the problem and to
the admins of the open relay asking them to fix it.
All this has been extensively and releatedly discussed in the newsgroup
news.admin.net-abuse.email. Please take any further discussion there.
