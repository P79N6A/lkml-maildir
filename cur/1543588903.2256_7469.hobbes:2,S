I just tried 2.4.3-ac13 on my laptop, a Toshiba Tecra 8000, which has a
NeoMagic video controller.  I boot it using the VESA frame buffer, using the
arguments:
	video=vesa:mtrr vga=0x317
for a 16-bit 1024x768 screen.  The video doesn't come on at all, but the
machine boots up normally (ie, I can log into it via ssh via the wireless
pcmcia card).  If I boot up with the VGA console, the screen is displayed just
fine.  This worked in 2.4.3-ac11.
Also, I initially built ac13 with:
	make mrproper
	make menuconfig
and it doesn't ask whether I want to build the normal USHI USB driver either as
a module or builtin to the kernel, only whether I want to build the alternative
USHI USB dirver (the JE driver).  Make xconfig asks whether you want to build
both drivers.  I'm not sure whether this was a bug in previous versions or
not.
