Hi folks,
I am not sure if you are already aware ot not, but looks like nobody
noticed it yet. Look:
casus:anton$ ls /proc/ide/hda
cache     capacity  geometry  media  settings          smart_values
capacity  driver    identify  model  smart_thresholds
casus:anton$ ls /proc/ide/hdc
capacity  capacity  capacity  driver  identify  media  model  settings
Multiplay capacity files. Funny :)
