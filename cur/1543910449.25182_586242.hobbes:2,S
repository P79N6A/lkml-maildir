TSO is beneficial for the software again. The linux code currently
takes several locks and does quite a few function calls for each 
packet and using larger packets lowers this overhead. At least with
10GbE saving CPU cycles is still quite important.

Shouldn't you qualify that?
It is unlikely you really duplicated all the tuning for corner cases
that went over many years into good software TCP stacks in your
hardware.  So e.g. for wide area networks with occasional packet loss
the software might well perform better.
