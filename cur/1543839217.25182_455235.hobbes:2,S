Yes, cdevs do not, themselves, show up in sysfs.  A simple class is what
you want for that part of the job.

It is correct, in that it returns the reference you hold to the cdev's
internal kobject.  If you got the cdev with cdev_alloc(), that's the
only way it will get returned to the system.  For a cdev allocated
elsewhere (as is the case here) it probably doesn't make any difference.
