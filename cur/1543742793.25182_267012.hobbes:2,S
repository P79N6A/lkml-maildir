Dear Kernel Developers,
Is it possible to incorporate the next patch which I had to introduce to
have the vfat fs of my ipod to get mounted under Linux.
Originally its vfat was mounting ok, but then at some point which I
didn't clearly mentioned, it stopped... probably it happened after I
attached ipod to some windows box, because now windows still can easily
mount it whenever vanilla linux kernel refuses...
Or should I just adjust my ipod's fs definition?
Thank you in advance
