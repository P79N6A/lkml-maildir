Hi.
When trying to boot 2.4.21-ac1 (and 2.4.21-rc8-ac1 too, actually) the
kernel starts oopsing for a few minutes with large call traces and since
it won't log anything to the disc at this point and the fact that I'm
unable to attach a serial console to my Acer Aspire 1300XV I don't really
know what's wrong, just that it starts just after the "hdc: [...]"..
2.4.21 with the same things compiled in boots normally.
Hope this info will do some good.. .config and lspci output attached.
