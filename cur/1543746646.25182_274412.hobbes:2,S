Please accept that there are people who requested these features and
there are people who find them useful.
I really hope you understand that delaying a suspend is very different
from allowing the user to interrupt it.
Also, many people suspend Linux only to reboot into Windows. In this
case, the ability to tell the machine to reboot instead of powering down
is very useful. Obviously, a perfect user would plan ahead and suspend
"appropriately", depending on what he wants to do
afterwards. Unfortunately, I have found that I'm not a perfect user and
that I really tend to use and like these features.
As for me, I would much rather have a useful kernel that a beautiful
kernel, because I rather tend to use it than watch it, but I can
understand that other people may have different priorities. I would
suggest we find a compromise.
