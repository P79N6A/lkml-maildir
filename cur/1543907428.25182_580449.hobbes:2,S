So sorry for the delay in getting the .22.y release out, my appologies.
I think I've gotten all the patches that people have sent us, _and_ are
already in Linus's tree.  If you have sent us stuff that I have missed,
please resend.  If you have sent us patches that are not in Linus's tree
yet, please be sure to notify us when they do go into his tree in order
for us to be able to add them to the next review cycle.
This is the start of the stable review cycle for the 2.6.22.2 release.
There are 84 patches in this series, all will be posted as a response to
this one.  If anyone has any issues with these being applied, please let
us know.  If anyone is a maintainer of the proper subsystem, and wants
to add a Signed-off-by: line to the patch, please respond with it.
These patches are sent out with a number of different people on the Cc:
line.  If you wish to be a reviewer, please email stable@kernel.org to
add your name to the list.  If you want to be off the reviewer list,
also email us.
Responses should be made by August 9, 2007 19:00:00 UTC.  Anything
received after that time might be too late.
thanks,
greg k-h
