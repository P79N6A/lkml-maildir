vendor-sec has no control over dates or who else gets to know. We can
ask people to also notify others, we can suggest dates to people but
that is all. So if you think 7 days is sensible when reporting a hole
specify you will be making it public in 7 days.
If vendor-sec ignores a request for example that the bug doesn't go
public until date X then we just don't get told in future and we get
more 0 day crap
