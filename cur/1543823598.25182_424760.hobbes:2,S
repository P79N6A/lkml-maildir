You should check for the overlapping partitions as well. The label
itself may be left over if someone repartitions an ex-AIX disk. Simply
adding this test is going to give one or two people a nasty "where has
my data gone" kind of shock.
Having said that perhaps the IBM people can provide proper information
on how to detect/parse the AIX partition data ?
