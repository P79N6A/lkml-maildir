Are you sure? At least it seems we do in 2.6.4:
active state:            C2
default state:           C1
bus master activity:     00000000
states:
     C1:                  promotion[C2] demotion[--] latency[000] 
usage[00067690]
    *C2:                  promotion[--] demotion[C1] latency[090] 
usage[00673373]
     C3:                  <not supported>
Servus,
