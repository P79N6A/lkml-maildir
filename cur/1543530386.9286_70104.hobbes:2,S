Yikes! This means that anything compiled with 2.95 will get a different
structure size from a 2.7.2.3 compile if it included rwlock.

That explicit compiler version dependancy has to go. I guess the reason
for it is to make sure they take up no space on a UP compile.

If its the the lock causing the problem then the below won't fix it
because the ip_send also writes the hh_type field. I really think
that the hh_type should be made unsigned int and the rwlock moved
to the end.

Have there been any other responses to this?

Trust the computer industry to shorten "Year 2000" to Y2K.
It was this kind of thinking that caused the problem in the first place.
