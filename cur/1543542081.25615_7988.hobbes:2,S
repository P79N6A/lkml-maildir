the newest lowlatency patch for the 2.4 kernel series can be downloaded
from:
  
http://www.redhat.com/~mingo/lowlatency-patches/lowlatency-2.4.0-test7-A0
managed to fix a bad latency source - the scheduler had a window during
which it missed wakeups, both on UP and SMP kernels. This fix is included
in the test7-pre7 kernel and is not included in the lowlatency patch.
Benno, does the test7-pre7 + lowlatency-2.4.0-test7-A0 kernel still show
those bad latencies you reported?
reports, comments, suggestions welcome,
