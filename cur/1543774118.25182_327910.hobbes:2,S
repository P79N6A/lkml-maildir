Good point.  I've come this far somewhat reluctantly, but can see that 
udev is a better long-term solution.  Once devfs is gone, it's easier 
for me to justify doing the work to go fully over to udev (GregKH, can 
you post a link or two to those "packages" you refer to?).
And also, once devfs is gone it's an easier economic decision for my 
customers, too: either they move ahead and get whatever new features 
that non-devfs kernels offer, or they do the work to keep the current 
stuff in the state they want it.  It's their call, I (sometimes) get 
paid either way...
And it isn't like just my customers would be in this situation, everyone 
will have to face it.  So it's "fair" for everyone.
So, I guess I'm into the "say goodbye to devfs" camp now.  In case 
anyone asks, that is.  :^)
