Hi,
I'm no real C guru, neither am I a kernel guru, but I managed to compile Linux-
2.4.32 with gcc-4.0.2 (I also could boot that kernel, but couldn't load the 
modules as SuSE 10.0 lacks the old mudutils required to do that).
Please have a look at the attached diffs, as som of my fixes seem to wipe out some 
real C nonsense, independent of the compiler issues.
Note: gcc still produces a _lot_ of warnings, but at least the kernel compiles.
Regards,
Ulrich
