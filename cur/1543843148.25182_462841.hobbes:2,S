Hello lkml'ers
If you happen to have the same mobo, MSI AM2 K9N NEO-F
http://www.msi.com.tw/program/products/mainboard/mbd/pro_mbd_detail.php?UID=733
and streaming disk i/o works for you, plase send me:
* kernel version and .config
* hdparm -i output
* lspci -vvvxxx output
Thanks... now with gory details.

As Alan pointed out, there aren't any obvious differences which
may affect IDE. They are mostly in AMD CPU Northbridge...
I bought SATA II Samsung drive yesterday. Created 32gb file on it.
Windows XP can do "copy 32g nul" - no problems.
The very same thing on Linux randomly crashes in a few minutes.
Please note that I was using Linux on this machine for a bit more than
a month and I had just one unexplained (at that time) crash.
I compiled stuff on it and copied a lot of files (kernel trees, for one),
without crashes. It was feeling like everything was working okay.
So it seems likely that memory corruption and resulting crashes
occur only when there are large amounts of streaming I/O, "short"
reads/writes (less than ten megabytes at once) are affected much less
or not affected at all.
BTW, I tried running with mem=500 and tried 32-bit kernels,
still crashes.
I also did a direct device-to-device copy using dd
(translation: no filesystem code involved) and it crashed too.
And to repeat: it happens both on PATA IDE Western Digital drive
(WDC WD2500JB-55GVC0, FwRev=08.02D08, SerialNo=WD-WCAL78337950)
and this new Samsung SATA drive...
Does this rings any bells? What is different when I do streaming i/o?
IOW: where should I start poking in the driver? Because Windows
somehow works, dammit... it must be possible to make it work...
I do not have another mobo for testing.
