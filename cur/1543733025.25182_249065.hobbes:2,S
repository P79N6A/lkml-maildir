Fedota is only mentioned as an example because the development is so open
and I happen to see what's going on (I'm not using it myself at all).  I'm
pretty sure SuSE has/will have soon an update for i915, but it would requite
more work for me to find out.

Okay, let's take Debian stable as an example.  How do you get an agpgart
that deals with the i915 into the 2.4.18 kernel woody ships?
You really want the whole software stack to support new hardware.  And for
that you best go to a kernel that's not from stoneage, either a new upstream
release or a maintained vendor kernel.
