Hi guys,
In file include/asm-i386/pgtable-3level.h:
On i386 with PAE enabled, shouldn't pud_present() return (pud_val(pud)
& _PAGE_PRESENT) instead of constant 1?
Today pud_present() returns constant 1 regardless of PAE or not. This
looks wrong to me, but maybe I'm misunderstanding how to fold the page
tables... =)
Thanks,
/ magnus
