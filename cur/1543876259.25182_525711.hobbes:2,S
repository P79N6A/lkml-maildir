Make them be at the top of the device tree by adding them early. That's 
the whole point of the device tree after all - we have an ordering that is 
enforced by its topology, and that we sort by when things were added.
Right now the way things work is (iirc - somebody like Greg should 
double-check me) is that we add all devices to the power list at 
device_add() time by traversing the devices fromt he root all the way out, 
and doing a device_add() which does a device_pm_add(), which in turn adds 
it to the power-management list - so that the list is always topologically 
sorted.
So the only thing that needs to be done is to make sure that we add the 
timer devices early during bootup - something we have to do *anyway*. If a 
device is added early in bootup, that automatically means that it will be 
suspended late, and resumed early - because we maintain that order all the 
way through..
