You mean the user writes the check functions? Can you give an example how 
inlining is supposed to work here?

The scheme that I proposed implies that the refcount handling is changed.
It must be uniform for all object types that use reclaim.
If used for the dcache then dentry handling must be changed so that the 
refcount at the beginnDing of the slab is 1 if the object is reclaimable 
and the higher refcount needs to be an indicator that the object is in 
use. I am not saying that existing use gets us there. Maybe we need to 
call this a reclaim flag instead of a refcount?

We can check for a single high count object in a slab and then call
the destructor if we feel that is warranted. The refcount is an 
indicator to the slab of the reclaim status of the object.

"Inline" seem to be way to say that the user has to provide the function.

Correct. We would have to treat objects in a slab all the same. We could 
just kick out some if we find the slab at the end of the list and see how 
things develop. Pretty bare hacky LRU but it may be better than going 
through huge lists of small objects on a LRU lists.
