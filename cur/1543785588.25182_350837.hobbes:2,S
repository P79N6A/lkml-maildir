I'll try again: what is the point of still getting page faults on writes
when the first read will contain the wrong data?
And what is the point of writing to a prot_none with ptrace? That really
makes no sense.
I'm not saying the cow should go away, I'm saying that marking the pte
readonly after writing to it makes no sense.
I've said maybe_mkwrite makes no sense, I didn't say the cow makes no
sense.

I wasn't arguing about that, infact Hugh noticed that I suggested that
avoiding the cow is not an option (he's the one that disagreed with you
on this if something).
