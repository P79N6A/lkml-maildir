No, that does not change anything, however, you just figured
(unknowingly) my problem for the the ac4 kernel out.
Lilo updated the wrong sata harddisc in my system. My system came with 2
sata discs on a Promise S150 TX2plus, since i couldn't get that to work
at first, i tried to go for the onboard ICH5 SATA controller and moved
one disk there, however even though i told lilo that /dev/sda should be
bios=0x80, it kept on writing to the harddisk on the promise.
So status is now:
ac1 does not book - binfmt error
ac4 does boot
bk25+sata - reiserfs is broken
I will try bk28 tomorrow and see, where it get's me.
Thanks for the response.
