Hi,
Based on what I've read in the man pages for 
mmap/msync/munmap, and Stevens' APITUE, I think the following
program should create a file with scribbles in it.  What I get 
is a zero length file (on 2.2.1[46]).
Is this pointing to a bug in msync, or is there some other ;) 
FM I should R ?  Or maybe someone can give me a hint if I 
misunderstood something I supposedly read?
TIA -- Jim
