I _doubt_ it. If it is a pagecache issue it should apply to NFS. It should
apply to ramfs. It should apply to helluva lot of filesystems that are not
block-based. Pagecache doesn't (and shouldn't) know about blocks.

Umm... You do realize that get_block is _not_ visible on pagecache level?
Sure thing, filesystem should be free to use whatever functions it wants
for address_space methods. No arguments here. It should be able whatever
callbacks these functions expect. If filesystem doesn't implement reservation
it should use functions that do not expect such argument. That's it. No
need to invent new methods or shoehorn all block filesystems into the same
scheme.
