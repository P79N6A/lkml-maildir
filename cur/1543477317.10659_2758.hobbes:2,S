If the machine has that sensitive data then it should be locked up anyway.
If the person can get around to rebooting the machine with the three
fingered salute then he could just as easily open the case and steal the
hard drive.  Running /bin/sh is a good last resort measure.  And a
passworded lilo does nothing if the machine is booted from a kernel on a
floppy.
