So you're complaining that as a vendor you have to ship multiple kernels?
The point remains the same.
The only time I recall recently where a kernel hasn't booted was when the
AMD Athlon appeared, and the MTRR code needed fixing.
There wasn't a lot anyone could have done, without seeing documentation
(which iirc wasn't available at the time).
The reason NT & Netware probably loaded fine is that they don't set
the MTRRs themselves, but rely on third party utilities to do this
for them after they've booted.
All other recent cases of non booting that I've seen have been a
case of user error miscompiling for a wrong target.
As a vendor, you don't worry about this as you ship binary kernels,
and $enduser never needs to see a source tree.
