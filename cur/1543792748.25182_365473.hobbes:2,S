I personally find that a nice flow is to just continuously push
patches to you to merge into -mm, then once the merge window opens you
usually push the stuff onto Linus and it'll make the next kernel.
Anything I submit after the merge window opens will just stay in -mm
and wait for the next merge window (or next+1 depending on the patch).
But then my stuff is usually quite simple, so I guess that doesn't
work for everyone, but for me at least it seems to work well.
