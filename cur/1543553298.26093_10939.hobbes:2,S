Alan has a script in 2.2.x which attempts to find the best compiler for
building your kernel.  It looks for kgcc first, IIRC.
Alan's message wasn't clear, but it seemed to imply that a patch to add
this script to 2.4.x would be submitted to Linus.  gcc 2.95.2 is a bit
smarter about some things, and I definitely prefer using that compiler. 
I also prefer fixing 2.4.x kernel<->compiler bugs rather than defaulting
people to an older compiler.

This is a totally separate issue.  Choice of compiler is but one of many
variables.  We need the build system to export all these variables, and
ALSA and other external packages will then pick up those settings for
use in their own builds.  See for example
