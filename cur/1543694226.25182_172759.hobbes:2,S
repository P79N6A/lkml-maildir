You have a point, but remember that modern IDE drives can do about
50MB/s from medium. I don't think you'll find a CPU that is able to
handle transparent decompression on the fly at 50MB/s, even not with a
simple compression scheme as used in NTFS (see the NTFS docs on
SourceForge for details).

PS: let me guess: among other things, reiser4 comes with transparent
    compression? ;-)
