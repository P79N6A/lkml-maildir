Is there a reason why Solaris emulation exists in three different places:
	Solaris/sparc64: Linus' kernel tree
	Solaris/sparc32: iBCS
	Solaris/x86: My development iBCS tree
Now the final one is fair enough - I haven't really released it yet, but why 
are sparc32 and sparc64 kept separate? 
Is there a reason for the sparc64 version being integrated into the kernel but 
not sparc32? Would it be better to remove the sparc64 version and merge it 
instead with the iBCS code, to prevent duplication of effort?
