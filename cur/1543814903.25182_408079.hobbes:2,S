cpufreq_conservative should be marked broken on SMP - I have used it on UP 
boxes without trouble but I can't even safely modprobe it on SMP - it nearly 
ate my filesystem.  
And there seem to be multiple different problems with it - I get different 
oopses depending upon whether or not I have loaded it before or after the 
ondemand module.  Weird enough - cpufreq_conservative shares much of it's 
code with cpufreq_ondemand, which works without any problem. 
Let me know if anyone has objection to marking cpufreq_conservative 
depends !SMP - I am planning to submit  a patch soon.
