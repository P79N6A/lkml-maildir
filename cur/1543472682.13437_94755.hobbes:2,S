Hi,
Any ideas why I get this error? 
In file included from /usr/include/asm/spinlock.h:69,
              -----
              -----
/usr/include/asm/current.h:4: global register variable follows a function definition
/usr/include/asm/current.h:4: warning: call-clobbered register used for global register variable
My code compiles fine if I remove the 
register part of the definition for current.
i.e.: struct task_struct *current __asm__("$8");
in /usr/include/asm/current.h
best regards
Dev Mazumdar
