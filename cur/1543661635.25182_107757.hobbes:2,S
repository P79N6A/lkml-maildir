It might be a problem with display.vrows not being updated during
fbcon_resize().  I think I sent James some patches before that added
that.
Can you try adding this at the end of fbcon_resize() in
drivers/video/fbcon.c?
p->vrows = info->var.yres_virtual/vc->vc_font.height;

PS:  I never encountered your problem, but I don't have hardware that's
capable of ywrap.
