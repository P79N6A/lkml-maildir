I doubt it will make a difference. LVM and qlogic drivers seem
to be a bad mix. I've already tried the beta5 of 6.01
and same problem exists - ooops about every 5-8 days.
Removing LVM and solved the problem.
The changelog only lists small changes since between 6.01 and 6.01b5
Although one entry suggests a fix to a race in qla2x00_done
that would allow multiple completions on the same IO. Not sure
if this relates to my problem with LVM as this occured with
earlier versions of the qlogic driver without the dpc threads.
