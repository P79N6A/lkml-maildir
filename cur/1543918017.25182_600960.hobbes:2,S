Well, I think that we could do something like this :
#define KERN_CONT ""
...
	printk(KERN_ERR "foo");
	<100 lines of whatever>
	printk(KERN_CONT "bar\n");
It would indicate the author's *intent* which is to continue a line which
has already been started. It would both permit us to remove false positives
from automated scripts, and to read the code more easily. And this is not a
big constaint for the author, given that such constructs are quite rare.
