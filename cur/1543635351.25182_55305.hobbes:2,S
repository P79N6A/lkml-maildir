How early? If this is just to get gettimeofday() working, can't it
wait until the regular initcalls are done?

If you look in include/asm-i386/fixmap.h you'll see that the BT ioremap
pages are temporary, and they do disappear once mem_init() [or whatever]
is done [pgtable.h sets VMALLOC_END to just below FIXADDR_START, which
protects the permanent fixmaps but intensionally not the temporary ones].
If it seemed to work for you then that's just luck, or perhaps it does
work in highmem kernels?
For things that must be mapped very early and continue to be mapped as
long as the kernel is up, you need a permanent fixmap. fixmap.h has a
number of permanent fixmaps defined #ifdef CONFIG_* and you can easily
add your own there, under #ifdef CONFIG_X86_IBMEXA.
