Stefano Brivio reported udelay()/mdelay() effects in the b43 driver. 
(and it caused driver failures for him.)
Stefano, could you please try to sum up your experiences with that 
issue? Is it reproducable, and the 5 patches i did fix it? (if yes, 
could you try to re-do the mdelay verifications perhaps, to make sure 
it's not some other effect interacting here. In theory sched-clock 
scaling has no effect on udelay behavior.)
