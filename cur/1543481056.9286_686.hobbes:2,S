I'm seeing this too.
I don't see it on 2.1.131 or 2.2.0-pre5
procps 1.2.9-2 (redhat 5.2),  Compaq, Pentium Pro 200, 128Mb, APM
enabled
APM doesn't seem to be working right either.  The screen will shutdown,
but full power down doesn't seem to happen.  This is a desktop, so I'm
not really sure how much it powers down, I just get a blinking power
light when it does.
