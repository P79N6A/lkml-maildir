Hello,
in the last time I got several e-mails from you, but that must be a mistake 
because I do not know you and I don´t know why you send me these e-mails. 
Please check whether you have the address schwung@rumms.uni-mannheim.de in your 
address-book. Please delete this address!! In past you have put this address in 
the field: copy and blind-copy.
Thank you very much!
