I don't think it's a good idea to mess with this for 2.6.14
In general the maxaligned stuff is imho bogus and should be removed. That is 
what CONFIG_X86_GENERIC is for. It doesn't make sense imho to separate
the variables in two aligned classes - either they should be aligned in 
all cases or they shouldn't.
