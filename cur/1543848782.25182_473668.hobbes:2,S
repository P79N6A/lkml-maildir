After reading all that, i think this is wrong list to post such things.
Anyway.
Note, that you didn't mentioned yours shiny laptop's architecture.
More to that, if it's cool-modern CPU from Intel or just a AMD's one,
what linux-kernel version you're running? As for me, i don't know
neither what Inspiron 6000 is, nor kernel versions "ubuntu dapper
(edgy)" is running. And if you will know all that information, better keep
it for your's google skills, not for further postings here.
Also if you want to compare power consumption, better include time
tasks ran, thus one can estimate real *work* done by system for
application and finally amount of actual heat.

Search lkml for 'ACPI' and 'Linus', after that, just relax and reboot to
windo$ and forget anything else ;)

If you _really_ want to do something --  read sources, build kernels,
tune kernels and somewhere in between RTFM. And finally share results.
