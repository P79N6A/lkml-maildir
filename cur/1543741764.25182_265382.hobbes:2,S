Yes they did. I downloaded the original NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-6111-pkg1.run,
extracted the source and found in nv.c many things like:
#ifdef NV_CLASS_SIMPLE_PRESENT
    class_simple_device_remove(MKDEV(NV_MAJOR_DEVICE_NUMBER, 255));
    for (i = 0; i < num_nv_devices; i++)
        class_simple_device_remove(MKDEV(NV_MAJOR_DEVICE_NUMBER, i));
    class_simple_destroy(class_nvidia);
#endif
and in conftest.sh the check for class_simple_present by checking for
struct class_simple.

Ok. I can live with that.

Well, funny answer, but not useful for now.
Best wishes
