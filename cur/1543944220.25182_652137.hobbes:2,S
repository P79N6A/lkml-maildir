I have an alternative (with help from Paul Mackerras).
We have a branch in linux-next that is stable and only progresses forward
i.e. is never rebased.  Global API changes/introductions that are of type
1 above go into this branch (after appropriate etc).  Fixes to them go in
as well.  People can base development on this branch.
But ... they can only really do that *if* we can guarantee that part of
linux-next will be in Linus' tree very early in the next merge window.
So here is the had part ...
We need to ask Linus to promise that he will pull the stable branch from
linux-next first in the merge window.  For that to happen, I would expect
that Linus would also review and sign off (or ack) these commits to the
linux-next tree.
The rest of linux-next would always be based on the stable part plus
Linus' current tree.
Will this fly?

I am hoping that this time shift will allow more time for bug
fixing/polishing.  But maybe I am being to optimistic again :-)

And may be you can get more sleep and dream up some more schemes :-)
