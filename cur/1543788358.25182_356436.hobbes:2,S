I can think of one main reason...existing code.  Also, nanosleep() 
rounds up excessively in many kernel versions, so that a request to 
sleep for less than 1 tick ends up sleeping for 2 ticks.
The select() man page explicitly mentions this usage;
"Some code calls select with all three sets empty, n zero, and a 
non-null timeout as a fairly portable way to sleep with subsecond 
precision."
