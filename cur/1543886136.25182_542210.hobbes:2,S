But... I thought the page lock was now taking care of that in your
scheme?  truncate_inode_pages has to wait for the page lock, then
it finds the page is mapped and... ahh, it finds the copiee page
is not mapped, so doesn't do its own little unmap_mapping_range,
and the copied page squeaks through.  Drat.
I really think the truncate_count solution worked better, for
truncation anyway.  There may be persuasive reasons you need the
page lock for invalidation: I gave up on trying to understand the
required behaviour(s) for invalidation.
So, bring back (the original use of, not my tree marker use of)
truncate_count?  Hmm, you probably don't want to do that, because
there was some pleasure in removing the strange barriers associated
with it.
A second unmap_mapping_range is just one line of code - but it sure
feels like a defeat to me, calling the whole exercise into question.
(But then, you'd be right to say my perfectionism made it impossible
for me to come up with any solution to the invalidation issues.)

Yes, if there's going to be that backup call, the first won't really
need a barrier.

Though indeed we did so, I don't see that we needed to increment
truncate_count in that case (nobody could be coming through
do_no_page on that file, when there are no mappings of it).

It's a small improvement to your common case, I agree.
