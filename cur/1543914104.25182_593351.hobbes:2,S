At the moment this will cause ppc64 to crash, since we rely on
pci_dev->sysdata pointing to some node in the firmware device tree,
either the device's node or the node for a parent bus.
We could change the ppc64 code to use pci_dev->bus->sysdata in the
case when pci_dev->sysdata is NULL, which would fix the problem.  I
think that change should be incorporated as part of this patch so that
we don't break git bisection.
In other words I don't want to see this patch applied as it stands.
Paul.
