For the curious I have recently been reading about this (I'm a nervous
flyer, you wouldn't believe the kind of statistics I scare myself
with) and discovered the term RAT - RAM Air Turbine. In the event of
fuel running out, modern aircraft automatically drop this turbine and
generate sufficient power for navigation (and hopefully safe landing).
There's a famous early 1980s case in Canada known as the Gimli Glider
in which this actually ended up happing after a computer that
performed imperial/metric conversion failed and the manual calculation
was wrong - they coined a popular Canadian phrase because of this.
What we need is a mechanism to have a giant brainstraw emerge from the
front casing of the machine and suck the brains out of the guy running
a server with overcommit issues.
