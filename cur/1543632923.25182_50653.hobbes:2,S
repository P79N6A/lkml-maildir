Dears.
    I saw the kernel patch 2.4.19pre10 and 2.4.19pre10ac2 release at
3.Jun.2002
The item 1 to 4 bugs still inside in 2.4.19pre10, Alan has fix some in his
tree.
Our latest driver patch is for kernel 2.4.18, you can reference the mail I
sent before.
Someone I don't know always modify our patch code and make things
complicated.
    Andre, only your name list in pdc202xx.c, So I think the problems should
be solved
by you. Could you fix all ASAP? If linux kernel wants our patch code, I
think they should
not modify our patch code and maintains by ourself.
Or do not make troubles for our company.
Thanks in advance
Hank Yang

Item 4 is already done in my tree. As I said before the patch you sent
me a while back did not apply and appeared to be for an old 2.4.17/8
tree. I never got an update beyond that so I had assumed the problem had
already been resolved.
Andre - want to go over the rest and send me the bits ? Or Hank do you
want to send me a patch versus 2.4.19pre to fix those bugs
