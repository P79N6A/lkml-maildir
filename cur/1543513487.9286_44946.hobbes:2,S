As you know, the development of Linux has differed in many ways from the traditional development of large-scale software projects.  As University of Michigan researchers, we're trying to better understand how that process has worked, in particular by studying communication patterns within in the Linux community
If you use Linux -- and particularly if you've participated at all in the Linux development process -- we'd be grateful if you could spare a few minutes to fill out our survey.  You can find the survey at:

Thanks in advance for your help!   -- Nathaniel Borenstein & Mei Lu
PS -- Please feel free to forward this survey to other Linux-related groups or individuals who you think will find the survey welcome.
