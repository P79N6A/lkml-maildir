Managable chunks means logical changes go together, one function per
diff is really extreme and unreviewable. Support for extents is one
logical change, so it's one patch. Unless of course you have to do some
preparatory patches, then you'd do those separately.
I must admit I thought you were kidding when I read through this extents
patch series, having a single patch just adding includes!
