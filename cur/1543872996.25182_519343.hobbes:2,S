I'm not an expert in this area by any means but after reading this
thread the OSX solution of simply telling the kernel "I'm the GUI,
schedule me accordingly" looks increasingly attractive.  Why make the
kernel guess when we can just be explicit?
Does anyone know of a UNIX-like system that has managed to solve this
problem without hooking the GUI into the scheduler?
