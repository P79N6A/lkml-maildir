Mmmm, I've looked at the code today and it turned out that
we're NOT right ;)
The mmap_sem is used in procfs to prevent the list of VMAs
from changing. In the page fault code it seems to be used
to prevent other page faults to happen at the same time with
the current page fault (and to prevent VMAs from changing
while a page fault is underway).
Maybe we should change the mmap_sem into a R/W semaphore ?
Since page faults seem to be the "common cause" of blocking
procfs access *and* since both page faults and procfs only
need to prevent the VMA list from changing, a read lock would
help here.
Write locks would be used in the code where we actually want
to change the VMA list and page faults would use an extra lock
to protect against each other (possibly a per-pagetable lock so
multithreaded apps can pagefault in different memory regions at
the same time ???).
regards,
Rik
