Subject: [PATCH] synchronize_irq needs a barrier
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

synchronize_irq needs at the very least a compiler barrier and a
read barrier on SMP, but there are enough cases around where a
write barrier is also needed and it's not a hot path so I prefer
using a full smp_mb() here.
It will degrade to a compiler barrier on !SMP.
