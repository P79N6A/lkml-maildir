Well, basically I load the machine with some make -j nuts_number_here,
and I do some other things. The vanilla kernel always behaves badly,
with things like switching windows, loading web pages taking a visible
amount of time to get some cpu attention. The others always win. I mean,
for every load, ranging from a make -j5 to a make -j25 the system
_feels_ better than vanilla. With granularity, it was quite noticeable
(but the kernel compiles were noticeable longer too - some you win and
some you loose :-).
As I said to you on IRC, I wasn't able to make xmms skip with any
kernels (does anyone have a recipe for this?), which I guess is the
issue that started this thread.
The only issue I had was with app startup time (although starting a new
X session was indeed faster - strange).

Well, if things doesn't get worse, it's already a start, right? :-)
In fact I believe it's moving forward. It feels clearly better than
plain 2.5.73, but I don't know if others share the same view. My tests
weren't very scientific nor realistic, it's just a matter of 'looks
good'. Although I think 'feels good' is sometimes better than a lot of
numbers. If there's a way to get some precise numbers, let me know of
it. I thought that contest was a good choice.

Dunno what happened, I've Followed All The Instructions(TM). I'll look
at this later.

I'll test your latest patch later to see the improvements. Should I run
another contest on it or doesn't make any difference?
