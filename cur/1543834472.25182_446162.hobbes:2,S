Subject: [PATCH 0/2] OLPC + Geode fixups
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The following two patches are in support of the OLPC project.  I sent these
patches before, but somewhere along the line I failed to correctly follow up.
The first one does some PCI ID cleanup (which is always nice), and the 
second allows one to disable VGA probing, which is essential when using
the OLPC LinuxBIOS which doesn't have VGA/VESA support (yay!).
