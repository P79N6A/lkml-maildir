No I don't. I saw the discussion about that recently, but I don't have
that problem.

I'll have to see if that helps, thanks for the tip.

I don't know of the other stuff, but since there's a patch for Linux
which does audio grabbing with DMA, I'd assume it's possible.
Then again, is DMA that important for these fairly slow devices? PDC20265
and CMD649 don't seem to support DMA with ATAPI devices (in Linux
at least), but I have none of these performance problems with those
contollers, only the VIA 686b.
