Jeff Mogul recently wrote an interesting paper called "TCP Offload is
a Dumb Idea Whose Time Has Come":
http://www.usenix.org/events/hotos03/tech/full_papers/mogul/mogul_html/
(It's 6 pages long and in HTML - easy to read.)
After explaining why TCP offload is a dumb idea, he goes on to argue
that *if* storage area networks are replaced with switched ethernet,
and RDMA becomes popular, TCP offload might make sense for sending
data to your disks.
This is a good, short paper to read if you are interested in TOE for
any reason.
