A better fix is to use the separate vectors, avoiding spinlocks
in most cases. But this is a simple immediate fix for 2.6.25.
The better solution is being worked on, but it needs some
reasonable testing before it is ready for inclusion, and that
won't be till post 2.6.25.
(This is a regression, fixes in the m68knommu interrupt subsystem
exposed this).
Regards
Greg
