Subject: glibc patch to use 32-bit UIDs (important note)

In order to actually use 32-bit UIDs on Linux, in addition to the 32-bit
UID kernel patches you also need a patched version of glibc that knows to
make the new system calls.
The following patch to glibc-2.1.1 will work with my 32-bit UID patches
for Linux 2.3:
http://www.engin.umich.edu/caen/systems/Linux/code/misc/2.3/19991130/glibc-2.1.1-highuid.patch
In order for glibc 2.1 to build properly, /usr/src/linux needs to contain
the headers from the 32-bit UID patched kernel. It may be enough to just
copy over the file [linux source dir]/include/asm-xxx/unistd.h.
Beware, this patch is incomplete in the sense that the resulting glibc
will only work on a kernel that has been patched to use 32-bit UIDs. In
other words, if you switch your system to use this glibc and then boot an
ordinary kernel, your system will crash.
This patch, or an updated version, will be included in all future releases
of the 32-bit UID kernel patch.
Thanks,
Chris Wing
