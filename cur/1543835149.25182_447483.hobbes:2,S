Damn right.
I'd be very happy to remove (or #ifndef __KERNEL__ as needed) the
dreadful S_FOO macros. I'd be much happier with plain old octal,
as is normally used for both syscalls and the chmod command.
(the non-octal nonsense was probably invented for porting
software to non-UNIX systems)
If you like the ls way though, you might as well add the file
type notation:  drwxr_xr_x, _r__r__r__, _rw_r__r__, etc.
That's not too bad. Plain octal is best though.
