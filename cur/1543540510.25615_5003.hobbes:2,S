Legislated safety hinders progress by those who accept and overcome risk, 
and all progress originates with the actions of unreasonable people.
Thankfully, open source precludes subjection to autocratic tyrants (except 
perhaps on IRC).  Gcc 2.95.2 works fine here, your mileage may vary.
To Red Hat: Go for it!  Shake up our world!  Many of us remember you leading 
the transition to glibc, and now (in hindsite) appreciate your actions.
Safety begets complacency.  A little pioneering anarchy now and then may 
be good for us all.
