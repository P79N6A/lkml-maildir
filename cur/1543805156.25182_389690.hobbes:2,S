Well we may need that.   For the moment let's consider putting both
a kpid and upid and the task_struct, and elsewhere. Basically I don't think
translation is necessary in the common case.
However let's look at a single practical case to see how it would need
to be implemnted.
struct fown_struct.  Every file has one and you can modify it both on
a socket with ioctls FIOSETOWN,SIOCSPGRP,FIOGETOWN,SIOCPGRP.  And on
a normal file handle with fcntl with FSETOWN, and FGETOWN.
Since a struct file can be passed between processes in different
pid spaces using unix domain sockets we cannot count on the context
of the signaler to be the same as the context of the setter.
So we need to look at how to handle this case cleanly, and safely.
