Subject: [PATCH] buffer_insert_list should use list_add_tail
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Hello all,
buffer_insert_list puts buffers onto the head of bh->b_inode_buffers,
which means that on fsync we are writing things out in reverse order.  I
think we either want this patch, or we want to walk the list in reverse
in fsync_buffers_list
(this has not been well tested, but I can't think of any problems it
would cause)
