   Could you check this patch?
   (This patch is against 2.5.65.)
I applied this patch with some minor changes.
First, many functions in net/ipv6/exthdrs.c and net/ipv6/reassembly.c
can be marked static now.
Second, some local variables (for example, "nhoff" in ip6_input()) can
be eliminated entirely because they compute a value in one place and
use it in the very next line and nowhere else is it referenced.
Thank you.
