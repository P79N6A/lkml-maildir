I meant blocking, of course, but you caught that.

 From what Andries posted, we can't block.  If select says its readable, we can 
"return data, an  end-of-file  indication,  or  an  error other than one 
indicating that it is  blocked".
We have no data, network sockets don't have end-of-file indication (or would 
returning a length of zero count?), and there is no other suitable errno that I saw.
