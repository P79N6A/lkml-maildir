Hello Vojtech,
Is there any particular reason why this didn't make it into 2.6.2-rc1? I
just checked the 2.6.1 to 2.6.2-rc1 patch, and the only change to
char/keyboard.c seems to be a change in an #ifdef.
Cheers

Remember the 3 golden rules: 1. It was like that when I got here. 2. I
didn't do it. 3. (To your Boss) I like your style.
