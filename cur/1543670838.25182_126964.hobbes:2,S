[SNIPPED...]
drivers/char/riscom8.c uses old methods including 'cli' and 'sti'.
It hasn't been fixed yet. Remove this from your configuration
and try again.
No code should use cli and sti. If any compile errors out on 2.5.n.n,
as a result of this, and you need the driver, you might try to inspect
the source and contact its maintainer. There are a lot of cleanups
on-going in this version.
Cheers,
