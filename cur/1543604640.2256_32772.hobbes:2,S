Nice, a bunch of comments about the front end. But you miss the point
that what was broken in gcc-2.96 was the back end (the optimizer). 
And you missed that it needed about 50 updates to get a real compiler.
gcc that ships with RH 7.1 generates bad code in optimized mode. Do not
remember the exact post in LKML, but I saw 2 lines of code that made gcc
put the user initialization of a variable before the automatic one to zero.
If you want a good distro, take Mandrake 8.1.
