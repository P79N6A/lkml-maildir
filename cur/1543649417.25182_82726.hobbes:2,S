That was one of the questions, since you claimed it didn't "scale" 
without being specific as to which axes that was with respect to.
If the problem is the cost of reregistration (which seems likely) then 
fixing that requires extending the model upon which the aio framework is 
based. If the proposed extended model is not acceptable, it would be 
best to fix that before spending the time to implement it.
