Correct. 2MB worth of struct page is 128 mb of memory. Are there nodes 
with smaller amounts of memory? Note also that the default sparsemem
section size is (include/asm-x86_64/sparsemem.h)
#define SECTION_SIZE_BITS       27 /* matt - 128 is convenient right now */
128MB ....
So you currently cannot have smaller sections of memory anyways.

We do this pmd special casing in other parts of the core VM. I have also a 
patch for IA64 that workks with this.

You want a benchmark to prove that the removal of memory references and 
code improves performance?
