Hi,
sorry if it is already known: There appears to be an error in the
SMP-code for Alpha in the 2.2.9 release. The swapper produces a
deadlock-situation immediately after entering the SMP mode. 2.2.7 did
the job for me.
On bootup the kernel shows the following messages (I try to
reproduce exactly, but it's the copy-by-pen method):
Entering SMP Mode
secondary_console_message: on 0 from 1 HALT_REASON 0x0 FLAGS 0x1ee
secondary_console_message: on 0 message is 'P01>>>START P01>>>'
smp_boot_cpus: Total of 2 Processors activated (1979.71 BogoMips)
start_secondary: commencing CPU 1 current fffffc0000f1c000
spinlock stuck at fffffc000032af9c(1) owner swapper at fffffc000032a5d4
spinlock stuck at fffffc000032af9c(0) owner swapper at fffffc000032a5d4
then the machine is stuck completely.
The machine is a Samsung DP264 (Tsunami-chipset) with two 21264
processors, 500MHz, 4MB Cache.
I am not on the list, so if you reply, please cc to me.
Bye,
Bernd
