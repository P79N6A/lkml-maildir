I ran the test 100 times, no failures!  Looks good to me.
# for ((i=0;i<100;i++)); do ./sched_football 4 10 | grep "Final ball position" 
| tee sched_football_ball.log; sleep 1; done
Final ball position: 0
...
Final ball position: 0
Looking at the patch, it looks like the problem was a race on the runqueue 
lock - when we called double_runqueue_lock(a,b) we risked dropping the lock 
on b, giving another CPU opportunity to grab it and pull our next task.  The 
API change to double_runqueue_lock() and checking the new return code in 
balance_rt_tasks() is what fixed the issue.  Is that accurate?
I was doing some testing to see why the RT tasks don't appear to be evenly 
distributed across the CPUs (in my earlier post using the output 
of /proc/stat).  I was wondering if the load_balancing code might be 
interfering with the balance_rt_tasks() code.  Should the normal 
load_balancer even touch RT tasks in the presence of balance_rt_tasks() ?  
I'm thinking not.
Thanks,
