In the big servers which equips cpu-hotplug, apps should work as they designed.
If not, apps are already in buggy state.
IMHO, just stopping it is better than allowing execution in buggy state.
I used SIGSTOP. If a system admin or SIGCONT handler can modify cpu_allowed of
stopped thread, apps can go on. I think this is a realistic workaround.
(if the process is stopped, parent process of it can catch it by waitpid.)
p.s.
I think prefer cpu + allowed cpu will help this kind of probem, but there is no
interface..
