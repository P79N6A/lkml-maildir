Relative to the current directory of course.
I've been propagating for this too, since it makes life so much easier
for people compiling multiple versions of the kernel.
The idea is that you tell people to untar the sources for whatever kernel
related packages at the same place they untarred the kernel sources.  For
most users this will mean /usr/src (i.e. on a RedHat system).
So for the simple case:
    /usr/src/linux
    /usr/src/pcmcia-cs
    /usr/src/my-whizbang-adapter
and the pcmcia-cs and whizbang packages simply have line in Makefile saying:
    KERNELDIR=../linux
For somebody who's playing around with multiple kernels, it would
look something like this:
    /usr/src/kernel-2.2.16/linux
    /usr/src/kernel-2.2.16/pcmcia-cs
    /usr/src/kernel-2.2.16/my-whizbang-adapter
    /usr/src/kernel-2.2.17pre3/linux
    /usr/src/kernel-2.2.17pre3/pcmcia-cs
    /usr/src/kernel-2.2.17pre3/my-whizbang-adapter
And this will work with _no_ modifications to the sources and without
any need to set environment variables.  How much easier can it get?
