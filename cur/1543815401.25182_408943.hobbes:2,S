Believe it or not, there *are* people running their servers with full
graphical environments. At the place we first encountered the interactivity
problem with my load-balancer, they first installed in on a full FC2 with the
OpenGL screen saver... No need to say they had scaling difficulties and trouble
to log in !
Although that's a stupid thing to do, what I want to show is that even on
servers, you can't easily predict the workload. Maybe a server which often
forks processes for dedicated tasks (eg: monitoring) would prefer running
between "desktop" and "server" mode.
