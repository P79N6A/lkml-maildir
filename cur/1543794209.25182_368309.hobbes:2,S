         Yes, the lock  needs to be protected by the robust semaphore.
         The locking order is:
                 mmap_sem to protect the vma that holds the pthread_mutex
                 robust_sem to protect the futex_mutex chain.
                 futex_mutex - the rt_mutex associated with the 
pthread_mutex.
         This section of code performs the locking of the first waiter
         on the pthread_mutex, which was locked by another thread in the
         fast path in userspace.  The fast path locking does not enter 
the
         kernel.
         The first waiter locks the futex_mutex and then changes the
         owner to the 'owning' thread.  The waiter then calls 
down_interruptible
         to block on the futex_mutex.
         I'll provide a patch to protect this piece of code.
