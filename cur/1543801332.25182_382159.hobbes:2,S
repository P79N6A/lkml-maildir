[2.6.13.3] occasional oops mostly in iget_locked
It seems that those oopses in iget_locked are gone since I ran 2.6.14.4
and currently run 2.6.15.

[2.6.15] reproducable hang
this one still happens. System loses total network connectivity. When I
dial the system (by phone), asterisk (the software pabx) picks up the
phone and plays a sample, then it becomes mute. After that, the system
doesn't respond to anything at all. Even sysreq+t is ignored.
The last message on the console is:
eth1: transmit error tx status register 82

Haha no I did not do that :-)
