That's progress ... last time I tried APM on 2.6 it failed horribly.

That's happened for as long as I remember (2.4 also).
Still seems buglike to me, maybe 2.6 will finally squish it...

Seems buglike to me, with the first call being wrong (before the
children were suspended) and the second being right (after).

The converse of the "suspended-twice" problem:  first call right,
second call (after children) wrong.
