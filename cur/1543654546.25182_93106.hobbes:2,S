If I enable the ACPI subsystem it doesn't boot at all.
no log in /var/log/messages, only a call trace on the video, but it is too 
long and it scroll down too fast so I can only see few line.
the call trace ends with this message:
Code: 8b 00 0f 0d 00 81 7c 24 0c ac 00 45 c0 0f 85 7a ff ff ff 9c
  <0>Kernel panic: Aiee, killing interrupt handler!
In interrupt handler - not syncing
sorry, my laptop doesn't have a serial port, so I cannot dump the call 
trace...
anyone who can ? anyone experiencing the same problem ?
passing the acpi=off option the kernel boots normally
I'm running acpi 20021122 under 2.4.20 and it works like a charme...
are there substantial difference between the 2.4. and 2.5. version of ACPI ?
bye
