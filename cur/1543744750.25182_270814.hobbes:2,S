Hello,
I have bought a controller card Promise SATA II 150 TX4 (PDC 20265)
It doesn't seem supported by the module SCSI_SATA_PROMISE on a kernel 
2.6.9. (Because version 2)
the result of lspci :
 Unknown mass storage controller: Promise Technology, Inc.: Unknown 
device 3d18 (rev 02)
I came back to a kernel 2.4.27 because the promise's module  can't be 
compiled on a 2.6.9.
The problem is , I can't boot my system on the with this solution
Is a module envisaged for this card? (or maybe another solution)
Christophe
