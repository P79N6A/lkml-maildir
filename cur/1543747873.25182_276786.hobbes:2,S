The patch was fine when it left my MUA.

It does not freezes after a few packets (say 64), right ?
Can you triple check that you ran the right module (compilation in the adequate
directory, modules_install, module stat and such) ?

You can try the untested attached files (no warranty). A failure with the 2.4.28
version of the r8169 driver is something new. Can you send a description of the
computer + complete dmesg + lspci -vx + ifconfig before/after freeze +
/proc/interrupts contents before/after connection freeze ? Does the connection
recover if you ifconfig it down/up ? Same thing after rmmod/modprobe ?
