I think Jeremy's question was due to trying to reduce the 32/64-bit 
differences.  Performance-wise, it might add a small amount to user 
setup time (a typical 32-bit process will need all four, for the main 
binary, libraries, stack and kernel, respectively) but it is probably 
not significant (although I'd like to see numbers just in case).
