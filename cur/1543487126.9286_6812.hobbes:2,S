The difference wasn't the speedup but the ligher CPU load. The uglyness
was not particulary critical since the flag was checked only in one place
if I remeber well, but yes now that I don't use it anymore I don't like it
too much too...
I think we can kill the flag and left the IOCTL owned by 2.0.36.
