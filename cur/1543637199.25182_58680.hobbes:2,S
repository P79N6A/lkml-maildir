Perhaps if you have your spool over nfs:
man flock:
NOTES
       flock(2) does not  lock  files  over  NFS.   Use  fcntl(2)
       instead:  that  does  work  over NFS, given a sufficiently
       recent version of Linux and a server which supports  lock­
       ing.
       flock(2)  and fcntl(2) locks have different semantics with
       respect to forked processes and dup(2).
