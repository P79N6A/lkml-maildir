Andrew,
	2.5.69-mm4 is failing to boot.  It completes init_rootfs() in
mnt_init() but does not complete init_mount_tree().  Call me dumb, but
nothing obvious jumps out at me, I don't see any diff(1) from -mm3, and
I don't really have time to actively debug it.  I can indeed build and
try kernels.
	This is the WimMark box.  Compaq ML570.  4x700MHz Xeon, 2GB RAM.
Still boots all the other kernels fine.
Joel
