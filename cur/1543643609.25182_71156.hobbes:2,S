S.M.A.R.T. is useful to prove that a drive is dying, but it is not useful to prove that it is not.
I.E. if you get a S.M.A.R.T. message saying that the drive is dying, then believe it, and back up your data, but don't rely solely on S.M.A.R.T. to detect a dying drive.
In any case, though, check out:
