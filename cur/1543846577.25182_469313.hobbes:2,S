As I described in previous e-mail, there are completely _no_ limitations
on iterfaces - it is possible to queue events from any place, not matter
if it is new interface (which I prefer to use) or any old one, which is
more convenient for someone. There is special herlper function for that.
One can check network AIO implementation to see how it was done in
practice - network AIO has own syscalls (aio_send(), aio_recv() and
aio_sendfile(), which create kevent queue and put there own events,
it is completely transparent for userspace which does not even know that
network AIO is based on kevent).
