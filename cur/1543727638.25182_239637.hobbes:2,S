Are you saying that it's hashing incorrectly or that the final form is
not in the standard bit-order? For the purposes of a random number
generator, the latter isn't terribly important. Nor is it particularly
important for GUIDs.

Last time I proposed a cryptoapi-based version, I couldn't get any
buy-off on making cryptoapi a non-optional part of the kernel. Looking
forward to your patch/paper.
