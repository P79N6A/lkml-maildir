Actually, we added CONFIG_BUSYBOX_EXEC_PATH so you could feed it a different 
path to the busybox executable if you haven't got proc.  It's still a hack, 
and it still breaks when you chroot, but you can use the standalone shell 
without /proc.
Why do people chroot?  To do system recovery using busybox with the standalone 
shell and built-in commands.  They chroot into the damaged root partition to 
run some of the commands in there (shared library paths get a bit twitchy 
without the chroot), but they want to use the built-in busybox commands for 
most of it because PAM and selinux can get screwed up by passing birds, 
brightly colored wallpaper or large flowers, and when they do they interfere 
with everything.
*shrug*  This was a bigger deal a few years ago, before the invention of the 
knoppix CD...
