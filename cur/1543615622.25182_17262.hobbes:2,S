 What about CONFIG_BLK_DEV_FD, CONFIG_SERIAL and CONFIG_PARPORT_PC?  ISA
devices of this kind are still often present in systems even if no ISA
slots exist.  Actually CONFIG_BLK_DEV_FD is purely ISA and it uses ISA DMA
(so it requires kernel/dma.c, which is ISA-only).
 An example of such a system stands next to me now -- no ISA slots but all
of the above devices.
