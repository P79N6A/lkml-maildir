Hello, Massimiliano, Hi Daniel!

I'm indeed working on 2.6.14.2 and I get the problem with findutils 4.2.20 and
up. I've checked my system's reiserfs partition... no problems. Otherwise,
the machine is pretty simple:
/$ mount
/dev/hda1 on / type reiserfs (rw)
devpts on /dev/pts type devpts (rw)
/$ find --version
GNU find version 4.2.20
Features enabled: D_TYPE O_NOFOLLOW(enabled)
/$ find |grep smb.conf
./etc/samba/smb.conf.default
./etc/samba/smb.conf
./usr/man/man5/smb.conf.5.gz
find: WARNING: Hard link count is wrong for .: this may be a bug in your filesystem driver.  Automatically turning on find's -noleaf option.  Earlier results may have failed to include directories that should have been searched.
And after an update to stock:
/$ find --version
GNU find version 4.2.26
Features enabled: D_TYPE O_NOFOLLOW(enabled) LEAF_OPTIMISATION
It's still the same:
/$ find |grep smb.conf
./etc/samba/smb.conf.default
./etc/samba/smb.conf
./usr/man/man5/smb.conf.5.gz
find: WARNING: Hard link count is wrong for .: this may be a bug in your filesystem driver.  Automatically turning on find's -noleaf option.  Earlier results may have failed to include directories that should have been searched.
The Patch, Daniel mentioned didn't make it into the latest findutils-4.2.26, but if
I re-apply it manually (attachment), it tells me:
/$ find --version
GNU find version 4.2.26-ck
Features enabled: D_TYPE O_NOFOLLOW(enabled) LEAF_OPTIMISATION
/$ find |grep smb.conf
./etc/samba/smb.conf.default
./etc/samba/smb.conf
./usr/man/man5/smb.conf.5.gz
find: WARNING: Hard link count (44) is wrong for ./proc: this may be a bug in your filesystem driver.  Automatically turning on fid's -noleaf option.  Earlier results may have failed to include directories that should have been searched.
So, I guess that something in /proc is messed up a little.
Anymore checks I can do?

Well, I don't think so. I can easily reproduce that on my machine here:

Hmm, okay, I see, the PCIID's are missing. :-(
That's basically a Intel PIIX4 chipset, RTL8139, and a ATI Rage II card.
Can we narrow down the problem a little? Hmm, do you need more info?
Thanks so far,
best greets,
