The serial console appears to be innocent.  The suspend/resume methods
for my 16550A serial port aren't even being _called_, apparently because
pnp swiped ttyS0.  Disabling pnp support, the port suspends and resumes
just peachy.  /sys has a different layout without pnp enabled.  With it,
there are platform/ttyS[1-3] entries, but ttyS0 is in pnp.  Without pnp
support, the platform/ttyS* entries are gone, as is of course pnp/ttyS0.
I guess I'll have to switch "rummage" directories.
