AFAIK there isn't any convention.  The PCI related files 
(/sys/bus/pci/devices/...) don't have a particular naming scheme for 
example.

Nope, again if you access the PCI files you may end up programming the 
hardware in some way.  There may be other examples of this elsewhere, 
but I haven't looked.
