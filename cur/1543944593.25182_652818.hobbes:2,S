Which is already the case without the SES kernel bloat.
Case in point, the excellent user-space application
"lsscsi" would clearly show which device is SES.
And the excellent user-space application "sg_ses" could
control an SES device.

So that means that it needs a kernel representation?
If this indeed were the case, for every "feature" of every
type of device (not only SCSI) then the kernel itself would
be insurmountably big.

And none of this means that it needs a kernel representation.
1. You're not "standardizing" any known, in-practice,
kernel representation, that is already in practice and
thusly needs a kernel representation.
2. The kernel itself is not using nor needing this
"representation" in order to function properly (the kernel).
Leaving control of SES devices to user-space makes both
the kernel and the vendors happy.  All the kernel needs
to do is expose the SES device to user-space as it currently
does.  It makes it so much easier both to vendors and to
the kernel to stay out of unnecessary representations.
Vendors may choose to distribute their own applications
to control their hardware, as long as the kernel exposes
an SES device and provides functionality, as opposed to
policy of any kind.
