I've already tried both settings for "USB legacy", neither work.  I'm
currently attempting to update the BIOS. The update I tried a couple
weeks ago didn't work and gave an error, but there appears to be a new
one out, so I'm trying that.  Is there anything else that it could be?  
What
exactly does the keyboard code check when it generates that error?
Thanks for your help!
