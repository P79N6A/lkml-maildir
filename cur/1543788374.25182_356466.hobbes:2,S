That's easy to solve: filesystem returns -EAGAIN, namei_open() redoes
the lookup and continues with the resolving.  There would have to be
some safeguard counter to avoid infinite loops.
Filesystem could even populate the dentry with the symlink in
->open_create() to optimize away the relookup.
Do you see a problem with that?
