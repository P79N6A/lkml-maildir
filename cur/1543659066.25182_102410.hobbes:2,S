No this problem is not here, at least not in 2.4, I did test it ;)
ide_config_drive_speed will call ide_dma_host_on, not ide_dma_on. 
Note that I think sl82c105 and ide-pmac are the only ones to redo the
DMA config on ide_dma_on. Most chipsets only do it on ide_dma_check, but
I chosed to do it in ide_dma_on too mostly because I found no way to
re-trigger ide_dma_check from hdparm (well, this might have changed
since, I have to dbl check).
