Hi,
You mentioned in your changes to the wireless core for 2.5.68 that you
had sent updates for the various drivers to the different driver
maintainers.  As it looks like your changes made it into 2.5.69, but the
driver updates didn't, do you have a pointer to these updates so that
those of us with now non-working wireless cards can test them out?
Specifically, in my case I'm looking for the updates for the orinoco_pci
driver, as that has stopped working in 2.5.69, but was working just fine
in 2.5.68.
thanks,
greg k-h
