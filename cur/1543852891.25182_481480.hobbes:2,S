Greetings,
I patched the kernel with the extra systype patch located at this link.
http://www.vipu.org/~eki/alpha-titan-systype.patch
Now the kernel seems to compile fine.  By the way I am compiling a kernel 
specifically for titan type systems.  Not a generic alpha kernel.  I know eki 
had given me links to 2 patches before.  For some reason I thought they were 
both incorporated into the alpha-titan-video.patch you were working on.  I 
hope this information helps.  Not sure why the second patch is needed.  Good 
to know though.
Regards,
Jason
