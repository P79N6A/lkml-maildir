... and this will simplify the code! I think this is a nice idea.
Something like this:
	if (base != &new_base->t_base) {
		if (unlikely(base->running_timer == timer) ||
		    !spin_trylock(&new_base->t_base.lock)) {
			/* The timer remains on a former base */
			new_base = container_of(base, tvec_base_t, t_base);
		} else {
			timer->base = &new_base->t_base;
			spin_unlock(&base->lock);
		}
	}
But please update comments too, and don't forget to cc Ingo and Andrew
at least. In my opinion this patch should go separately from other ptimer
patches.
Oleg.
