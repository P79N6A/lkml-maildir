Ah thanks. Of course, as soon as I posted, I realized I should probably
have copied linux-scsi and/or gone and checked the archives there sigh.
Just getting back into the swing of things. If you need a tester, I'm
happy to do so on my setup.

Hmmm... the problem was that it was autoloaded - I haven't gone and
checked the code yet, but it seems that unless you don't actually build
sg at all, it gets pulled in whether you want it or not. Now that the
ATA passthrough stuff works for CDRW etc., I actually have no good
reason to load it. It just seemed a little "sucky" - if I had tried to
e.g. rmmod qlogicisp, it would correctly fail because st depends on it.
It seems weak that an attempt to unload st didn't catch the hidden
dependency. Actually, it seems that a workaround with no side effects is
to 'echo 1 > /sys/class/scsi_device/.../delete' for the tape drive. That
frees things up and unhooks sg without unloading it.
Thanks,
Tim
