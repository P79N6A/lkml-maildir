One way to reduce your backlog might be to choose a small subset of
the most urgent out of all your pending patches -- say, the minimum
required to get cris working if it doesn't build/work in the latest
kernel, or the most urgent bug fixes if it does still work -- and then
update just that subset.  By reducing the number of patches, you can
reduce the amount of time in step 4 and reduce the chance of entering
step 5.
Then, once that batch is merged, move on to the next most urgent set
of patches, etc.
Also, creating a git tree might make the job of rebasing patches
easier, and also reduces the friction in getting Linus to merge your
patches.
