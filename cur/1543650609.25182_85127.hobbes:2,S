My favorite part:
=====
In addition, Linux is still too dependent on local user lists. Universal
LDAP support and systemwide LDAP integration, not scheduled for 2.6,
need to be built in. On the server, this isn't a big deal, but deploying
desktops without comprehensive support for a global user directory can
be a nightmare.
