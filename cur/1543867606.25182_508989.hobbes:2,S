Hi there,
I own an older Sony Vaio SRX51P, European Model, P3 based. s2ram
identifies it with
    sys_vendor   = "Sony Corporation    "
    sys_product  = "PCG-SRX51P(DE)      "
    sys_version  = "01                  "
    bios_version = "R0232U2"
Suspend to RAM by using "s2ram -v -m -f" actually works and the
laptop comes back to life, is accessible by network, etc. kudos
so far.
The only but serious problem is, that the lcd stays off after
resume. No matter what kind of options for s2ram I try, if I disable
framebuffer or suspend from X, the lcd always stays off. Only
a reboot fixes this. Note that the X driver also cannot dis-/enable
the lcd (xset dpms force off). It always stays lit. I also tried
with i810switch, but that also does not affect the lcd.
spicctrl -b42 neither.
Latest kernel I tested is 2.6.20-git11 from today.
So has anyone of you suspend, acpi, sonypi, fb people an idea how to fix
this? I suspect one has to call some magic ACPI method upon resume? What
other kind of information would be needed to debug this? Anything more
to try? Are there some sony people here listening who can fix this?
Thanks very much for any help,
Jan
