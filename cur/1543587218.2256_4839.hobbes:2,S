Our Dell 4300, plus raid card, works okay with a 2.2.14 
kernel, which has a version 107 megaraid.o module.  This
is many versions behind the version present in 2.4.3.  More
recent driver modules for the card hand on booting, thus this
problem report.
The module source does not indicate a recent contact person for
discussing the module, all of the updates since 1998 are unsigned.
