   While we're on the subject of cache flushing... these make no sense:
   
   fs/binfmt_aout.c:357:           flush_icache_range(text_addr, text_addr+ex.a_text+ex.a_data);
   fs/binfmt_aout.c:381:                   flush_icache_range((unsigned long) N_TXTADDR(ex),
   fs/binfmt_aout.c:479:           flush_icache_range((unsigned long) start_addr,
   fs/binfmt_elf.c:422:    flush_icache_range((unsigned long)addr,
   
   the kernel doesn't execute the code ranges here, userspace does.  Which
   means that the only place in the entire kernel which does need to call
   flush_icache_range() is kernel/module.c, and that could all be done in
   module_arch_init().  So I think we don't need flush_icache_range() at all.
Need to go into the revision history, discover who added these
calls, and ask them why they were added.
