No seek -- offsets are passed to the read/write methods, like
pread()/pwrite(). 
We have read(), which reads from the flash hardware, erase() which
resets an eraseblock to all 0xFF, and write() which performs an bitwise
AND operation between the contents of the flash and the buffer provided
(you can only clear bits on flash, you can't set them except by erasing;
qv.).

CF != flash. For the purpose of this discussion, 'CF' and 'normal drive'
are identical concepts. They are block devices; not MTD devices. JFFS2
does not work on them (without trickery) since JFFS2 is not written to
use block devices.
Conversely, you cannot use FAT/ext/etc on real flash without some kind
of 'translation layer' to make it pretend to be a block device.
CF just happens to have that translation layer built in to its hardware
rather than doing it in software -- so as far as the computer is
concerned, CF _is_ an IDE hard drive.

No, it's nothing like a loopback mount. It's a pseudo-filesystem. Three
sane implementations of such a thing are already in the kernel, and one
hopelessly trivial readonly one.
