Ok fair enough. But I think the drivers should always think things are
handled in a PnP manner, even if they really aren't. ;-) For example,
between the stages where PnP enumerates the devices and the stage where
drivers get device_add notifications as a result of that, we will be
assigning the system resources to each device, but we could also
implement a way at this stage for people to manually alter things. I
think this is the right place to do this, as opposed to having all the
drivers implement code to probe for themselves.
Thoughts?
