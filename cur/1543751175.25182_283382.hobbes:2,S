Hello, Manfred,
The main concern I have with this is not cache thrashing of rcp->cur,
but shrinking the grace periods on large systems, which can result in
extra overhead per callback, since the shorter grace periods will tend
to have fewer callbacks.  We saw this problem on some of the early
RCU-infrastructure patches.
Another approach would be to conditionally compile the two versions,
though that might make the code more complex.
						Thanx, Paul
