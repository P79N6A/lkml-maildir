Use the RTC interrupt generator perhaps (if you have one)?  Call the
hardware people nasty things to tell them how dumb it is to make
hardware that requires frequent service without an efficient way to tell
the system when to do this.  Polling is never efficient, although it is
sometimes faster (although not usually in my experience). :)  After all
how did they think you were going to use the hardware?
