Because objcopy wouldn't remove the __crc_* symbols the way the
object files were generated previously. I explored all possibilities I could
think of, with that two step process being the last, but the only one that
had the intended effect. In the end I queried the binutils list, and got
confirmation that there's no (existing) way to get rid of symbols used in
relocations in an already existing object file without corrupting it.
