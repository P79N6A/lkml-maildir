    Hi Denis and Marcelo :)
>>     And is corrected just by inverting the two quoted code snips :)
>You are right
    I've added a couple of comments and one more test. I don't think
that mmap() should return 'addr' when len=0. Moreover, mmap() cannot
return '0' under *any* circumstance (so says the man page).
    I've tested the patch with a little program to test every
possible 'len' value and checking for mmap() returning the correct
value.
    This is the patch:

    I don't really know, but I'm pretty sure... Anyway I think that
the same patch is valid for both kernels with little or no
modification.
    BTW, the patch is not only mine, David Gómez Espinosa
(davidge@viadomus.com) has helped me with this issue too.
