Yes, it may be up to a few percent in extreme cases because it 
adds a stall on rsp on K8.  On the other hand the code
may get slightly smaller, because a rbp reference is one byte
shorter than a rsp reference.

Your oopses could get better backtraces, but that could be done
with frame pointers too (I'm surprised nobody did it already btw...) 
You can try to write a dwarf2 unwinder for the kernel  (actually
I think IA64 already has one, but it's quite complex as expected
and doesn't easily map to anything else). Even with that doing
a dwarf2 unwind interpretation will have much more overhead.  
For me it doesn't look unreasonable to recompile the kernel for
special profiles though.
