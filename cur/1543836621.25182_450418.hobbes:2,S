Sorry, I've been busy with offline stuff and won't be able to catch up with
emails until next week -- someone else might have already covered this.
But: I think we definitely agreed that a nice simple implementation and even
userspace API for grouping tasks would be a no-brainer.
I advocated implementing some simple controllers on top of such an interface
first, that people can start to put in some of their requirements, see if a
common controller framework should be created, look at what interfaces people
want for them.
I don't have a problem with CKRM as such, but I think there are other groups
with good approaches and the problem has been to get people working together.
