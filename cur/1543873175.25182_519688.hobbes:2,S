Look at rootplug_init where it does mod_reg_security.
If you have SELinux builtin, and subsequently register
rootplug, it will stack under SELinux.  Typically this
isn't the case (typically stacks with capabilities).

Check the linux-security-module archives.  This issue
has been discussed quite extensively numerous times
there.
