Willy,
The link_path_walk fix in v2.4.30 is related to a reference counting
bug triggered by "umount"...
As Christoph noted OpenAFS seems to be doing nasty things...  it seems 
to play with dentries inode i_state directly? If that is the case, 
maybe it should define d_iput? 
static inline void dentry_iput(struct dentry * dentry)
{
        struct inode *inode = dentry->d_inode;
        if (inode) {
                dentry->d_inode = NULL;
                list_del_init(&dentry->d_alias);
                spin_unlock(&dcache_lock);
                if (dentry->d_op && dentry->d_op->d_iput)
                        dentry->d_op->d_iput(dentry, inode);
