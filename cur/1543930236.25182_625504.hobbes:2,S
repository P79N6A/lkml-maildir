so if you have a script that does
echo "mail header" >tmpfile
echo "subject: >>tmpfile
echo >>tmpfile
echo "body" >>tmpfile
you want to have four seperate commits
what if you have a perl script
open outfile ">tmpfile";
print outfile "mail header\n";
print outfile "subject:\n\n";
print outfile "body\n";
close ourfile;
how many seperate commits do you think should take place?
what if $|=1 (unbuffered output, so that each print statement becomes 
visable to other programs immediatly)?
what if the file is changed via mmap? should each byte/word written to 
memory be a commit? or when the mmap is closed? or when the kernel happens 
to flush the page to disk?
'recording every change to a filesystem' is a very incomplete definition 
of a goal.
