No improvement.  (In fact, 2.4.2ac3 breaks 3ware IDE RAID support.)
While operating this Thunder 2500 (Tyan motherboard, ServerWorks chipset)
is like walking on a minefield, the problem I see with 2.4.2 64GB option
feels generic.  I'll go out on a limb, and claim that anyone with more
than 1GB can reproduce this CPU spin.
