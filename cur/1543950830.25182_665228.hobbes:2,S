Subject: [PATCH] Fix check after use in kernel/exit.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

mm_release won't check the mm_struct pointer, so it should
be checked before this call.
This patch was first posted here[1], and I don't know
why it was not accepted yet.
Thanks to "G. Vaughan" to remind me about this.
