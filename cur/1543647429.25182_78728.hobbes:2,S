The laptop has 200MB RAM, and mozilla and a ton of xterms loaded.  IDE 
drives w/ Intel PIIX4 controller.  The Dual Athlon has 512MB RAM, and I 
forget what kind of IDE controller -- I think AMD.  IDE drives as well.
BitKeeper must scan the entire tree when doing a checkin or checkout, so 
that is impossible to optimize at the SCM level without compromising 
features...  if your source tree takes up ~190MB on disk, you have 200MB 
of RAM total, and you need to sequentially scan the entire thing, there 
is nothing that can be done at either the OS or app level... You're just 
screwed.  Things are extremely fast on the Dual Athlon because the 
entire tree is in RAM.

Don't be silly:  I am more than willing to help, via answering 
questions.  If I had time I would help code.  I'm not religious about 
"only BitKeeper" to the exclusion of helping open source projects.  I 
simply use what is most expedient and productive for my kernel 
development workflow.
