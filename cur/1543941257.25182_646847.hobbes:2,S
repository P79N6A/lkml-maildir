Regarding the PyX Target Code: I have found a link via which I can
download a free 30-day demo. This means that a company is earning
money via this target code and that the source code is not licensed
under the GPL. This is fine, but it also means that today the PyX
target code is not a candidate for inclusion in the Linux kernel, and
that it is unlikely that all of the PyX target code (kernelspace +
userspace) will be made available under GPL soon.
