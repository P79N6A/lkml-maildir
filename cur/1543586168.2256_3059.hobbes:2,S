Hello Paul Cassella,
Once you wrote about "Hangs under 2.4.2-ac{18,19,24} that do not happen under -ac12.":
PC> [1.] One line summary of the problem:    
PC> Hangs under 2.4.2-ac{18,19,24} that do not happen under -ac12.
I have similar problem with 2.4.0, 2.4.1, 2.4.2.  I tried running -ac24,25,26
and 2.4.3-pre6 and I don't have any problems so far.
PC> [2.] Full description of the problem/report:
PC> I have had hangs under 2.4.2-ac18, -ac19, and -ac24, after uptimes of
PC> 36 hours, 12 hours, and 10 hours, respectively.  -ac12 has twice run

My uptimes were bigger, but each of them was 16 days + X hours (X being 0-20)
PC> All the crashes were under X.  The machine did not respond to pings,

I also have all these troubles under X.
PC> In the one crash that happened while I was at the console, X

I had it twice.
PC> The hangs don't appear to be related to IO load or anything else I can

No distributed.net client here ;)
PC> I ran with -ac12 with nearly 1300 lines of diff narrowed down from

PC> - i810, (Debian unstable) X 4.0.2, with DRI
I think that the problem might be somewhere he.  I am running i810, 
(RedHat 7...not original anymore :)) X 4.0.1.
PC> I'll be happy to try out patches, configuration changes, and other

With regular uptime of 16 days I will be very slow responsive for the testing
phase, though I am willing to try too ;)
