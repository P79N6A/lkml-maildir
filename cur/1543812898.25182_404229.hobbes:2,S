I am fairly certain that SLAB_DESTROY_BY_RCU is a entire slab
operation, not something that applies on an individual slab
entry basis.
Delaying the decrement of the struct pid with call_rcu does have the
advantage that we can safely do an atomic_inc(&pid->count) after
looking up the pid.

Thanks.  One semi painful thing that has occurred to me is that
we may want to make the definition.
struct pid
{
       atomic_t count;
       /* Try to keep pid_chain in the same cacheline as nr for find_pid */
       int nr;
       struct hlist_node pid_chain;
       /* list of pids with the same nr, only one of them is in the hash */
       struct hlist_head tasks[PIDTYPE_MAX];
       struct rcu_head rcu;
};
Using a hlist_head for tasks cuts the size of the structure almost in
half.   Which for a long lived structure is a desirable property.
Unfortunately hlist_for_each_entry_rcu takes an additional argument,
compared to list_for_each_entry_rcu.
