Subject: [PATCH] ATM breakage introduced in 2.4.0
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
2.4.0 introduced serious breakage to LANE. It's impossible to do
ifdown lec? ; ifup lec? because memory allocated by lec? is freed but
unregister_netdev() is not called, so SIOCGIFFLAGS tells me ok, but 
SIOCSIFFLAGS tells me -ENODEV. No, rmmod lec ; insmod lec does not help.
Patch follows

And it would be nice if I was able to build Fore 200e driver in 2.4.1 ;)
