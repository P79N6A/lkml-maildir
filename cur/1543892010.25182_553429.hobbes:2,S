I agree with Ben that recalc_sigpending_tsk() on tsk!=current is a bad 
idea. I think, since dequeue_signal() is called from user context, we 
could just have only recalc_sigpending(), that acts on current, and then 
inside dequeue_signal we have:
	if (tsk == current)
		recalc_sigpending();
What can happen, is that a task may notice TIF_SIGPENDING and not find a 
signal once it calls dequeue_signal(), but this is fine as far as signalfd 
goes. This should be OK in general, no?
