Consider that done.

I'm not actually sure that it's a good thing.  The different between the
sequences we do is that I do
	n n+1 n+3 n+7 ... n+2 (linear)
and you do
	n n+1 n+2 n+4 n+8 ... n+3 (linear)
which has slightly worse properties.  You avoid duplicated check on n+3,
but lose a very nice property - shifting the old sequence is guaranteed
not to have many intersections with original in the beginning (distances
between elements do not repeat).  With your sequence it's no longer true.

Ehh... Try to read that aloud.  Maybe it's just me, but "gdp" sounds (and
looks) bad...

True, consider that done.
Right now I'm doing alternative strategy for directory allocation, as soon
as I finish that I'll put the result on usual place.
