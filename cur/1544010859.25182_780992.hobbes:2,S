So, generally speaking, this means that I should not put a
platform_driver and an of_platform_driver into one source file, but
rather create an of_$DRIVER.c then? I found both ways used in the kernel
and could not find hints about the preferred way to do it. I took this
approach as I hoped it would save some code to directly convert the
of_node to uioinfo without the detour of using a platform_device
inbetween.
Kind regards,
