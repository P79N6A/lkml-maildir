sure it can, this is just a template.

no, we still need it. work->func() may be running on another CPU as well.

No, if the work skips rearming (or didn't yet), we set WORK_STRUCT_PENDING
successfully.

this work should be placed on cwq->worklist very soon, most probably
right after we drop cwq->lock.
