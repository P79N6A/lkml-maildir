May I chime in here, as it's a topic I am interested in too.
Have a look at drivers/isdn/gigaset/ser-gigaset.c if you like,
a driver for an ISDN adapter attached via RS232.
This is currently implemented as a line discipline, but I consider
that a hack. For one thing, it doesn't really fit the concept of a
line discipline because it doesn't transform the serial datastream
but instead diverts it completely to the isdn4linux subsystem. And
second, it means that a userspace daemon is needed which does
nothing but open the serial port, set the line discipline on it,
and go to sleep in order to keep the line discipline loaded.
The serio approach used by input/mouse/sermouse.c might provide a
more sensible way of driving that kind of device.
