The exit itself can fail as well, so it has to be done by the module code
anyway (until it suceeds).
What DoS opportunities are there? Module init failure is the exception
case and usally needs further attention, so we could actually disable
further attempts to load this module, unless the user tells us
specifically so.

Why is that sloppy? E.g. kfree() happily accepts NULL pointers as well.
