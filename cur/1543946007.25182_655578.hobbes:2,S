You shouldn't make the core scheduler dependent upon some hwmon module. 
I'd sugggest adding some register_cpu_temperature_monitor() function in the
scheduler then permit suitable monitoring modules to register themselves in
their module_init() functions.  Use a notifier chain from notifier.h.  The
CPU scheduler will walk that chain calling into the registered drivers at a
suitable time.
