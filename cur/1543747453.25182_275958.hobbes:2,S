I looked into them just to see if they could be used for user-space
priority inheritance. I saw that it takes (read-)lock on mmap_sem.
Isn't that potentially held for a long time? I don't know how the memory
subsystem works at all but my guess is that any changing of the process's
memory is done with mmpa_sem locked. The only way to prevent that is 1)
mlockall() and 2) stop increasing your heap.
I.e. you can't have one thread running real-time using a futex while
another runs non-real-time allocating memory in the same process.
Am I correct?
Another problem is the hashing of the futex. That inherently has a
non-deterministic timing behaviour. The more applications use futex'es
the slower this hashing gets :-( The slowdown might in practise be very
low because looking up in the global hash table can't take very many us!
Can't it just use a file-descriptor in the system call to look up the
futex instead of the hashing? That is RT-O(1), right? But, ofcourse, then
it is hard having a futex in shared mem.
