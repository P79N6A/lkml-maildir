Would it be possible to get rid of that if we attached
a struct address_space to each mm_struct after exec(),
sharing the address_space between parent and child
processes after a fork() ?
Note that the page cache can handle up to 2^42 bytes
in one address_space on a 32 bit system, so there's
more than enough space to be shared between parent and
child processes.
Then the vmas can track vm_pgoff inside the address
space attached to the mm.

If you mmap a file, then mremap part of that mmap, where's
the special case ?

Yes, that's a problem indeed.  I'm not sure it's fundamental
or just an implementation artifact, though...

Agreed.
