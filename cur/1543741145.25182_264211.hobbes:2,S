Yes, very strange given what the mistake is:
-               down_interruptible(&sem);
+               wait_event_interruptible(eh_wait, shost->eh_kill ||
+                               (shost->host_busy ==
shost->host_failed));
This condition is always true when the eh thread first starts because
the default quiescent state of a scsi host is
shost->host_busy = shost->host_failed = 0
so your change makes the eh_thread spin forever locking everything else
off the CPU.  On a UP system, this is a complete hang.
