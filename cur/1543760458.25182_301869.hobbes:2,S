That one is even worse... from what I see in your lspci output, you have
no bridge with AGP capability at all, and the various AGP devices are
all siblings...
Are you sure there is any real AGP slot in there ?
I'm afraid we may have to do the card <-> bridge machine as a bridge
specific function. At least the bridge driver can "know" how the HW for
that specific bridge lays out the PCI view of the AGP slot.
