OK, this *must* have been asked several times before, but I couldn't
find a thread about it.
When mke2fs creates a big ext2 filesystem, it seems to automatically
use a 4K block size unless I tell it otherwise. No problem with that.
But df(1) from GNU fileutils 4.0 reports all file system usage as if
the fs had a 1K block size. It counts the blocks OK, but computes
overall size, used, and free incorrectly. Bizarre. 
Is there just a patched version of df that I've overlooked ?
