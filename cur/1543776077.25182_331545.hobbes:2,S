Yep, thanks, that fixed it. I don't know why it only shows up on my 
configuration, but it was a bug, and this patch fixes it. I also took the 
liberty of upgrading to -06 while I was doing it, so I think you can probably 
release -07 with the specified changes.
So far no lockups, either, but I'm not convinced they're gone forever. I'll 
let you know how it goes.
