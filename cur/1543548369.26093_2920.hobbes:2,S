I think just grabbing a single dynamic syscall and passing that an operation
ID is the better way... Otherwise we probably have to export a large number of
dynamic syscall numbers for userspace to find.

Not really all that much difference in internal implementation. Just that a
char device requires allocation of a major device number.

My point is that read and write have pretty well defined semantics... and I
don't think it'd be a good idea to deviate from them. A side effect of a write
that changed some of the process's memory space would be bad.
Plus, it is entirely possible to accidentally construct valid data...
