Exactly.  The second one shows 2 revs, which is what you counted, and
the first shows 3 which is what is actually there.
See, all you have to do is look:
slovax /tmp/linux-2.5-cvs/linux-2.5 rlog REPORTING-BUGS,v 
RCS file: REPORTING-BUGS,v
Working file: REPORTING-BUGS
head: 1.3
branch:
locks: strict
access list:
symbolic names:
keyword substitution: o
total revisions: 3;     selected revisions: 3

Initial revision
As for your pointer to the revision history on the web which shows 2
revs, you just don't understand BK.  There is a 1.0 delta in every file
that we hide by default.  That would be the matching delta to the RCS
1.1 delta.

Hey, Roman, the statement above stands.  You made the choice that you want
to go write a competing system.  If you hadn't you could just use BK and
stop whining.  Since you have made that choice, which is your right,
how about you produce your competing system?  And stop whining that
we aren't giving you enough help.  What is that you say?  It's hard?
It's way harder if we don't give you a roadmap?  Well gosh darn, that
must really suck for you.  I'm really sorry that you can't figure it out
without our help but that's sort of the whole point, isn't it?
