Subject: [PATCH 5/6] SUNHME: Workaround ancient hang on U1's
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This work around has been in use by almost any distribution trying to
support sparc64 since at least 2002. Without it, sunhme hangs fairly
quickly on UltraSPARC 1's.
Dave, I know it's not in the kernel because it isn't a "fix", but given
that we haven't seen a fix in more than 5 years, can we get this out of my
tree please? :)
