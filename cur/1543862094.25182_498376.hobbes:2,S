I do think that something like this is probably a good idea, even on 
non-embedded setups. We historically couldn't do this, because mapped 
pages were too damn hard to remove, but that's obviously not much of a 
problem any more.
However, the page-cache limit should NOT be some compile-time constant. It 
should work the same way the "dirty page" limit works, and probably just 
default to "feel free to use 90% of memory for page cache".
