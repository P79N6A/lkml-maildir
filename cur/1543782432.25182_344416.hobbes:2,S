Subject: [PATCH] (22/22) ADBREQ_RAW missing declaration
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/8/25/26

pulled from m68k CVS; ADBREQ_RAW is used in arch/m68k/mac/misc.c, but its
declaration had not been propagated to Linus' tree yet.  Related chunk in
drivers/macintosh/adb.c also pulled in; even though the file is shared with
ppc, behaviour is changed only for m68k.
