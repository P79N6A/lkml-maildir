Looking through the do_page_fault(), I noticed there's a race in expand stack
because expand_stack() expects the caller to have the mm-sem write-locked.
I've attached a patch that might fix it appropriately. Alternatively, it may
be worth applying Andrea's 00_silent-stack-overflow-10 patch which fixes this
and something else too.
