So msdos is vfat WITHOUT lfn, which is a a restriction like noatime
or mounting ext3 as ext2.
That's why the default should be vfat indeed and the restriction should be
"nolfn", which will not allow lfns to be created and is what you actually 
intend, right?
But this will break API today, so it should be added to list of
features that will change.
