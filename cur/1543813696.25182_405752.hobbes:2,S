Roman,
Interrupts are enable before fn() is called, so an interrupt can
actually delay it long enough that userspace on CPU1 can set SIG_IGN
CPU 0
spin_unlock_irq(base->lock)	
			CPU1
			signal is dequeued
				timer is requeued
			user space code is executed
			user space code sets SIG_IGN
restart = fn();
Now fn() calls send_sigqeue() which returns 1, resulting in ret =
HRTIMER_RESTART which leads to requeueing of an enqueued timer.
