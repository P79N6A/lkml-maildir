This is not a problem with multiple streams implemented right - as a 
directory.
You don't stay away from directories just because you have to tar
them in order to put them on ftp sites? ;-)
Still, you're right that apps using streams jsut for the hell of it is bad.
That sort of thing happens all the time when something new shows up,
some people will use it without thinking.

Streams as a cache.

Actually, some if this is bad examples of using streams.
Why can't that index be stored _in_ the document?
After all, the word processor is the one who knows the document's
internal format, how to generate the index, and how to use it.  Well,
this example is bad anyway as an index can be created so fast from
a well structured document that there is little need for storing one.
(Example - see how lyx keeps a live index in the "navigate" menu. . .)
A document format may also contain fields specifying who made it, or
even a log of who modified it and when. 
It seems to me that streams are more useful for stuff that the file's
main application don't deal with itself.  Such as attaching icons that
follow the file around.

That would limit streams to caching use _only_, disks fill occationally
and we can't have _useful_ stuff disappearing at random.
