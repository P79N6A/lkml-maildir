It is perfectly legitimate to have a shared memory region memory mapped
from another namespace.  Yes sem ids versus semunds is an issue but it
just requires you to unshare one at the same time you unshare the other,
or to simply clone a new namespace.  I'm not familiar with the msq vs netlink
socket issue.  As for the user namespace vs open files.  If we have
any issues with open files in any namespace that sounds like an implementation
bug to me.
I'm not convinced the problems you are seeing are not implementation bugs.
For some things clone is still more general then unshare, and clone should
be considered the primary user interface, not unshare.

I will look more closely but I think there is an important point being missed
somewhere.  Pieces of the kernel interact in all sorts of weird and unexpected
ways.  If we rely on ourselves always being in the right magic namespace for
things to work correctly we are setting ourselves up for trouble.  If we know
a namespace implementation will work even when a process has access to entities
in multiple instances of that namespace we are in much better shape.
