I remebered you had the anon param too, though I didn't realize it was
for this reason :/
the reason why I go with the parameter is that sometime I've a single
call at the end of the function with the same new_page, but sometime
it has to be considered anonymous sometime not. So I couldn't split out
the interface with _anon/_file suffixes with some #define and remove the
0/1 numbering ugliness.
