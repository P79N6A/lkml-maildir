JFS is broken when the page size is greater than 4K, as is the case for 
Alpha.  This needs to be fixed, but I've put it off since I haven't had 
ready access to the right hardware, and I haven't had any success 
trying to boot a i386 kernel with a larger page size.  I'll try to find 
the time to work on this within the next couple weeks.
Thanks,
Shaggy
