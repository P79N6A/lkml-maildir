Subject: Working upstream toolchain for avr32?

AFAIK the latest available AVR32 toolchains are some patched gcc 4.0 and 
some patched binutils 2.17, and avr32 is currently the only architecture 
in the kernel where upstream of both of them is not capable of building 
a kernel for the architecture.
ALthough not technically a requirement, it would be nice if all Linux 
kernel archs could be compiled with plain upstream toolchains.
Even more since at some point in the future [1] current toolchains might 
no longer be able to compile the then current kernels.
Thanks in advance
Adrian
