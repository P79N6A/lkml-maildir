I can certainly do that.

Any better idea? I just wanted to prevent adding another #ifdef CONFIG_SMP, and since it doesn't matter where the write
goes for UP, doing it that way seemed the simplest solution.

While one could certainly make up names for them (the documentation of the functionality used here isn't the best I've
seen), I generally dislike creating defines when their values are used just in a single place *and* when their naming
can at best be artificial (i.e. doesn't serve documentation purposes). But if you and/or Jeff insist, I can certainly do
a change like that.
