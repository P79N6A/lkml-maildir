Hello Pekka,
this time a very good news, it seems your patch has helped ! For now I
am running 2.6.15-rc1 just fine. I wasn't able to trigger the problem
with wpa_supplicant (0.4.6). Don't see any f/w restarts or freezing. 
Only usual msgs (harmless messages ?):
ipw2200: Unknown notification: subtype=40,flags=0xa0,size=40
ipw2200: Unknown notification: subtype=40,flags=0xa0,size=40
ipw2200: Unknown notification: subtype=40,flags=0xa0,size=40
ipw2200: Unknown notification: subtype=40,flags=0xa0,size=40
ipw2200: Unknown notification: subtype=40,flags=0xa0,size=40
ipw2200: Unknown notification: subtype=40,flags=0xa0,size=40
For now I am booting from single user mode to a multi user mode and
allow wpa_supplicant to do it's work. Lets wait and see.
Also this time I saw f/w loading problem and as a result, oops:
http://www.gemtek.lt/~zilvinas/dumps/trace.4.
 
F/W load has failed as a result followed oops in yenta driver +
slabcorruption ... Rebooted several times, no f/w loading problems and
now I am running 2.6.15-rc1 in runlevel 2 (X started & services ...).
Lets wait and see what will happen next :) ...
Good work Pekka !
