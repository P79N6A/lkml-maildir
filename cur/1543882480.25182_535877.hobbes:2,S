OK.
Don't get me wrong - I do think this is neat code and is a good way of
addressing the problem.  (I'm surprised that the mmap protopatch didn't
touch rmap.c).
But I don't think it's a slam dunk and I would like you to appreciate the
constraints which I believe we operate under.  And I don't think we've
adequately considered alternative solutions to the immediate performance problems.
