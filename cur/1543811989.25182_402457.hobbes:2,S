I don't interpret it as being a full synchronous write. It's just a barrier
preventing reordering.  So the writes before could be in theory stuck
forever in some buffer - it just means they won't be later than the writes
after the fence.
Implementing the fences in the way your're suggesting would be very costly
because it could make them potentially stall for thousands of cycles.
I don't have a quote handy right now but volume 3 of the Intel/AMD manuals
have own chapters on the memory ordering rules elaborating on this in much more
detail.
