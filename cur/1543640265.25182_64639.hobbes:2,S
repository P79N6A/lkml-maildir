Could you describe how the improvement would be achieved
with this ?  Under what conditions ?

You don't want to make a syscall -- those are where kernel supplies
some service for the userspace.   What you do want is to add a block
compression function call within the kernel itself.
Now if that thing you have in mind would make sense, why it hasn't
been done in past 10 years ?  (It has been proposed a few times, though.)
That is due to:
 - You can't compress compressed data
 - In worst case, you end up needing MORE space than you
   begun with   (even one bit more space is too much.)
Sure enough it might work for most of the time, but when you get a page
full of maximum entropy data, and try to swap that, things fail.
