The operative phrase here is "if that affects the usual case".  Actually,
the quicksort bench is not that bad a model of a usual case, i.e., a
working set 50% bigger than RAM.  The page replacement algorithm ought to
do something sane with it, and swap performance ought to be decent in
general, since desktop users typically have less than 1/2 GB.  With media
apps, bloated desktops and all, it doesn't go as far as it used to.
My impression is that page replacement just hasn't gotten a lot of
attention recently, and there is nothing wrong with that.  It's tuning,
not a feature.
The sort failure is something to worry about though - that's clearly a
bug.
