I've seen machines offering up to 48, what's the magic number that makes you 
need to chagne nameing schemes?
I also know of systems with 50 serial ports on them. the fact that some of the 
serial ports on the front panel were named differently then other serial ports 
on the front panel sure didn't make my life easier in dealing with them.
