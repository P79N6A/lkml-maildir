OK, could you try this patch ? please note that it's just a test patch, not
one which should be applied to any tree !
If it hangs, it may be interesting to know what is the last line displayed.
Please halt your system out of X11 to see console messages.
It works for me on the P4 HT 100% of the time now.
Cheers,
Willy
