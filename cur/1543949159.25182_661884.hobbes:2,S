I've also noticed another issue, it appears that I accidentally gave PATCH 2/9 the wrong subject.  Patch 2/9
actually fixes /drivers/net/ac3200.c, while PATCH 1/9 is the one that fixes /drivers/net/8390.c.  
What's the easiest way to fix these two patches?  Do you want to just back out patches 1 & 2 and 
I can send them as part of a different patch set?  If I change the subject for PATCH 2/9, it might
be hard for others to follow this thread.
Sorry for the trouble, I'm still getting familiar the mechanics of patch submission.
