	Access != write permissions.

	IMO it's madness. If you are in hostile environment (malicious
local users) you can (and should) make your homedir accessible only for
you. The only other place you could care of is /tmp. Needs regular
cleanups on any box.
	Notice that malicious user can simply *open* the files and there
is nothing you can do with them. Even if you unlink them they'll stay
around until the attacker will want to close them. Your point being?
Uptimes up to hundreds of days are *good* thing on a multi-user box.
	It's a topic of regular flamewars in comp.unix.* - looks like it's
l-k turn. Sigh...
