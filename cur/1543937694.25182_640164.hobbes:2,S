No, it doesn't mean anything to 64-bit, but helps make the diff a little
bit smaller, getting pretty close now.
Still needs a bit of work to introduce oops_begin/end from 64-bit to
32-bit in traps_32.c and introduce a bad_pgtable-like function to
32bit, then we're down to small differences between 32/64 bit
do_page_fault and vmalloc_sync_all that should be relatively clean
to harmonize.
Got distracted with the ptrace stuff today, but patch coming soon.
