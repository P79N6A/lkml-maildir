Can reproduce this (2.4.15aa1).
MSI-6215 Booksize, Kernel APM (monolithic kernel, i.e. no modules), no BIOS
power management, no X11, no framebuffer, just plain 80x25.
Symptoms: Console blanks but no DPMS blanking (monitor goes not to powersaving
mode). The system is online (Internet, ISDN, ppp). Then scanning the system
using Nessus locks up the system solid. Nothing happens when there's no
ISDN/PPP activity. Didn't try this with LAN activity. No problems with a kernel
without any power management support.
