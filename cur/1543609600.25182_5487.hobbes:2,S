The problem with via82xx is that it is locked in 48000Hz (you can see this
in dmesg) and cannot play in any other rate. With mplayer you can see
messages such as requested 16000Hz got (480000) that explains why it sounds
like chip'n'dale ;-). P.s. I don´t know why it works with xmms  but with
mpg123 it refuses to play at all becouse these sound rates.
