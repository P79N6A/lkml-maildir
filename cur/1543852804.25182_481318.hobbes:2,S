(Foo on me for not chasing this earlier - I've been seeing it ever since I
started using the libata stuff several months ago - Alan Cox got things fixed
so I had the ata_piix driver at UDMA/100, and I never followed up on this part)
[   21.734165] ata1.00: ATA-6, max UDMA/100, 117210240 sectors: LBA
[   21.734171] ata1.00: ata1: dev 0 multi count 8
[   21.884789] ata1.01: ATAPI, max UDMA/33
[   21.889464] ata1.00: configured for UDMA/100
[   22.041527] ata1.01: configured for UDMA/33

[   22.192756] scsi 0:0:0:0: Direct-Access     ATA      FUJITSU MHV2060A 0000 PQ: 0 ANSI:5
(ata1.01 is a CD)
when smartd starts up:
[   92.567000] ata1.00: exception Emask 0x0 SAct 0x0 SErr 0x0 action 0x2 frozen
[   92.568000] ata1.00: tag 0 cmd 0xb0 Emask 0x2 stat 0x50 err 0x0 (HSM violation)
[   92.569000] ata1: soft resetting port

[   93.031000] ata1.01: configured for UDMA/33
[   93.031000] ata1: EH complete
(set of 6 messages repeated 5 more times)
[   95.346000] SCSI device sda: 117210240 512-byte hdwr sectors (60012 MB)
[   95.348000] sda: Write Protect is off

[   95.352000] sda: Mode Sense: 00 3a 00 00
[   95.353000] SCSI device sda: drive cache: write back
and then the entire set repeats again (6 sets of 6 msgs, then final 8).
And I *am* passing '-d ata' - /etc/smartd.conf contains:
/dev/sda -a -d ata -o on -S on -m root -l error -l selftest -s (S/../.././(00|06|12|18)|L/../.././03|O/../.././.[02468])
(Testing with removing '-d ata' results in smartd saying it can't talk to the
scsi device at /dev/sda).
Any ideas/suggestions?
