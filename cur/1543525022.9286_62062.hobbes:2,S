    When given the choice between (a) tossing all my computers that use
    ISA ethernet cards (~10 boxes, and another 10 motherboards that I
    use for compatability testing) and (b) de-MacOSing the device
    drivers, I'll choose (b), along with (c: bitching about it) any
    day of the week.

    david parsons \bi/ I could get some real modern hardware if I dicarded all
                   \/ of my ia32 machines and bought Suns, but that would take
		          a quarter of a million dollars.  Somehow I can't see
		                                             the point to this.
