Yes, we ( Shailabh and I ) were talking about exactly that this 
afternoon. This would mean that the denominator of the cpu shares for a 
given class <cls> is not determined solely by the parents 
total_guarantee but by:
    total_guarantee * size(cls->parent->cpuset) / size(cls->cpuset)
This is effectively what you describe below.

This would require some changes in the CPU scheduler to teach the 
cpu-monitor to deal with the limited scope. It would also require some
mods to the API :
Since classes can span different cpu sets with different shares
how do we address the cpushare of a class in the particular context
of a cpu-set.
Alternatively, one could require that classes can not span different
cpu-sets, which would significantly reduce the complexity of this.
