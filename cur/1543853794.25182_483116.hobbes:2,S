The following patchset adds the missing bits that allow kvm virtual
machines to be suspended and resumed, with appropriate
userspace support.
The changes are:
 - expose the pending interrupt bitmap to userspace
 - tsc save/restore
 - msr save/restore
-- 
Do not meddle in the internals of kernels, for they are subtle and quick to panic.
