I second this. I try to write detailed changes or at least to compact
the original explanations for patches that go into 2.4 hotfixes, and
sometimes I wonder if I don't do too much. It takes nearly 1/3 of the
time to get the patches in and compile the kernel, and 2/3 of the time
to write things that I sometimes think very few people will read. I
think that if i still do it, it's because I release far less often than
you and Chris do. Otherwise I would have given up.
One compromise might be to post the full changelog in the announcement
in addition to the shortlog. But I agree that security fixes are rarely
well documented by their authors, and CVE descriptions are sometimes
rather obscure :-(
