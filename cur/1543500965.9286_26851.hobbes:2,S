Yes, somebody did.  I distributed that as part of my old raw IO
patches, and will fold it into 2.3 if you like.

Exactly: it defined
+asmlinkage int sys_fsattr(const char * filename, unsigned int len,
+			  const char *in, char *out)
which also allows the vector of flag bits to grow beyond 4 bytes in the
future.  It mapped all of the ext3 attributes correctly to the portable
ATTR_FLAG_* definitions and allowed attributes to be set on device files
(which was the whole reason for it at the time).  The only thing missing
was the lfsattr variant.
