Of course sched_yield() is required to be supported, the question is for
how long CPU is yielded. Here is the quote from the SUS (actually the
complete definition of sched_yield()):
    The sched_yield() function shall force the running thread to
    relinquish the processor until it again becomes the head of its
    thread list.
As far as I can see, SUS doesn't specify how "thread list" is maintained
for non-RT scheduling policy, and implementation that immediately places
SCHED_OTHER thread that called sched_yield() back at the head of its
thread list is perfectly valid. Also valid is an implementation that
waits for 100 seconds and then places sched_yield() caller to the head
of the list, etc. Basically, while semantics of sched_yield() are well
defined for RT scheduling policy, for SCHED_OTHER policy standard leaves
it implementation defined.
