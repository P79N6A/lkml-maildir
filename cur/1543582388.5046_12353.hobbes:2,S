So put in the reliable check for it:
in start_context_thread:
	while (!keventd_task)
		schedule();
in need_keventd:
	for_each_task(tsk) {
		if (tsk == keventd_task) {
			if (tsk->mm == NULL && strcmp(tsk->comm, "keventd") == 0)
				return 1;
		}
	}
	printk("eek.");
	return 0;

So removing the debug code completely (which is what your patch does)
doesn't sound like the right thing.

Agreed.  The code snippet above should do that, no ?

That still won't catch keventd oopsing though - which I think might happen
quite easily in real life.
