The current OOM killer does this, except for init. Checking to see if the
process has a page table is equivalent to checking for the kernel threads that
are integral to the system (PIDs 2-5). These will never be killed by the OOM.
Init, however, still can be killed, and there should be an additional statement
that doesn't kill if PID == 1.
I think we need to sit down and write a better OOM proposal, something that
doesn't use CPU time and the NICE flag. Lets concentrate our efforts on what
constitutes a good selection method instead of bickering with each other.
How about we start by everyone in this discussion give their opinion on what
the OOM selection process should do, listing them in both order of importance
and severity, giving a rational reason for each choice. Maybe then we can get
somewhere.
