Confirmed.  Stock i686 v2.2.2 does this, while 2.2.1 does not.  The
only difference which seemed to me like it could matter is the following
from patch-2.2.2.gz:
diff -u --recursive --new-file v2.2.1/linux/net/ipv4/tcp_input.c linux/net/ipv4/tcp_input.c

 /* Called to compute a smoothed rtt estimate. The data fed to this
We added this because people were noticing that 723 byte transfers took
200 ms longer than 724 byte transfers, but apparently it's introduced
a race condition for localhost TCP now.
If I run strace on the server (before it forks, then following onto the
child), the problem won't happen.  Running strace on the client seems
not to matter.  If I run a CPU-hog process for each CPU in my machine,
and renice the server down by 19, the pair do not hang either, and tcpdump
shows that the client window doesn't close.
Just to summarize the data:
    - TCP to localhost hangs when the reader app consumes <= 956 bytes
    - Slowing down the writer avoids the hang
    - netstat output doesn't agree with tcpdump trace:
	  Proto  Rcv    Snd  Local Address   Foreign Address State      
	  tcp      0      0  localhost:1025  localhost:3333  ESTABLISHED 
	  tcp      0  39625  localhost:3333  localhost:1025  ESTABLISHED 
    - ps shows both client and server in do_select(), attaching with strace
       shows the right sockets, which line up in /proc/*/fd and /proc/net/tcp
    - It matters if the server forks or handles the client itself.
    - stock 2.2.2, x86 machines
Feels like a race condition.  Any ideas?
