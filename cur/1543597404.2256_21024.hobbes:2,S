The limits for reiserfs and ext2 for kernels 2.4.x are the same (and they are 2Tb not 1Tb).  The
limits are not in the individual filesystems.  We need to have Linux go to 64 bit blocknumbers in
2.5.x, I am seeing a lot of customer demand for it.  (Or we could use scalable integers, which would
be better.)
