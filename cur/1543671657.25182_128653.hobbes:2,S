Are there plans for the kernel to support multiple keyboard devices?
(I'm running 2.4-18SMP, which maps them all to one device.)
If not, perhaps someone can give me an idea of what I need to do.
What I want to do is get several USB keyboards to map to:
/dev/input/keyboard1, /dev/input/keyboard2, etc., the way multiple
USB mice are handled.
In case you wonder why anyone would like to do this, I want to
support multiple X servers.
