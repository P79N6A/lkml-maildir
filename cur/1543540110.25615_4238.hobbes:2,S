 Does someone have hints on the following problem:
 for some reason, my synaptics touchpad generates a lot of bad (or
unrecognized) packets in 2.4.0-test4 - and works great with 2.2.14.
Basically every few seconds of mouse movement gpm reports a ton of
unrecognized data then another few seconds it works fine. I have compared
the code with 2.2.14 and can't really see any that produces this. (I tried
commenting out the toshiba and compaq fixes.. no change)..
 I am using gpm version 1.19.3
                      thank you
