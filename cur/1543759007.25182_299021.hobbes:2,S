This is exactly how I see it as well.  Guess we drank the same koolaid ;-)
I don't see the reluctance to use -pre/-rc since that's already what
we're doing (just poorly encoded in -rc$x).  Also, .x.y does require
some release discipline, there may be cases where the .x.y fix should be
much simpler than .x+1-pre/rc fix (as in Greg's comment that fixes may
include basic API changes).
