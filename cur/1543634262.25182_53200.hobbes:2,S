I'm just not going to apply this patch.
Right now MAX_BUFFERS_PER_PAGE is 8 or 16, and the array of buffer heads
is thus 32 bytes on an x86. I'd much rather get a nice tight loop without
callbacks in the middle, and then submit 8 pre-approved buffers in one go,
than have issues like this.
If we have 64kB pages, such architectures will have to have a bigger
kernel stack. Which they will have, simply by virtue of having the very
same bigger page. So that problem kind of solves itself.
