After thinking back with what I did,
I was using 2.6.28-rc9 then(if I recall);
did a git-pull monday morning.
In the git log I remember seeing this:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=cb10ea549fdc0ab2dd8988adab5bf40b4fa642f3
then after compiling and rebooting
I noticed the mixer had changed.(thus seeing the no button for "front").
then after a few hours I reverted back to 2.6.28-rc9.
waited a few days and did a git-pull Wednesday morning,changed my .config
(after sending the original post);
then noticed that the "front" had changed to "speaker" on the mixer itself.
(telling myself "man I must be seeing things");
As for the .config options you're right, it doesn't make difference.
As for seeing any commits after sunday that might have fixed this
(not sure) I see loads of commits,
I can't keep up with this.
I think the best thing for me to do, is to not say anything,
until after all of this merging is done,(man santa is here!)
 then asses the situation.
Don't mean to cause any heat.
