	Ill be glad to run this again with your patch. Also, John Hawkes
has an even bigger system and keeps hitting lru_list_lock too.

	This has come up a few times on lse-tech. Lockmeter doesnt
measure cacheline hits/misses/bouncing. However, someone said
kernprof could be used to access performance registers on the Pentium
chip to get this info. I don't know anyone who has tried that though.
	I am working on a patch to decrease cacheline bouncing and it
would be great to see some specific results. Is anyone working on a tool 
that could measure cache hits/misses/bouncing?
