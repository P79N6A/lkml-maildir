alsa-lib handles both mixing (dmix plugin) and volume control (softvol
plugin) in software for codecs like this that don't do it in hardware.
Since Windows does mixing and volume control in the kernel (ugh) it's
increasingly common to find devices that cannot do these.  You don't
need to handle it in the driver at all.
dmix has been around for a while but softvol plugin is very new, you
will need ALSA CVS or the upcoming 1.0.9 release.
