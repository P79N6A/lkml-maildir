Only DMA for addresses >4GB.

The patch should perform slightly better than swiotlb=force
because it will only force bounce buffering for addresses >4GB.
If your torture test involves more than 64MB of IO in flight
you might also need to increase the bounce buffer area
with swiotlb=128M or somesuch.
