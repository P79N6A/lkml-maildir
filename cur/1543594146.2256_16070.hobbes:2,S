i think we are all missing the ball here: i am happy when i see driver
support for a piece of hardware that i have _NEVER_ heard of and at most
_ONE_ person uses it.  why?  it means more stuff works in linux.  we
dont need to defend how many people use hardware X.  if you have X, good
for you.  if not, you dont care, but at least good for linux as a whole.
driver support does not effect me if i dont use said driver.
in an ideal world, my kernel is super-small (ultra-optimized code) but
the full kernel source is huge (lots of platform and driver support).
lets stop fanning the flames and let this (Microsoft-using, as Rik
pointed out) troll die off.
