Good point.  I always use offsets (base_addr + REG_CONSTANT) but other
code I've seen, including acpi IIRC, use readb(&my_struct->foo_field);

Yes.  I hide base addresses under the hood, to make using the macros
easier.
#define RTL_R8(reg) (readb(ioaddr + (reg)))
so one only writes
	reg = RTL_R8 (Config1);
instead of 
	reg = RTL_R8 (ioaddr + Config1);
Since the driver code always creates a temporary named ioaddr, this
works.

Since isa_xxx is [hopefully] temporary until all drivers are converted,
IMHO IO-mapping.txt should be changed to simply say that
ioremap(0xc0000) is required just like I/O to any other mmio address.
