It leaks information about the parts of the pathname below the
directory that you otherwise would not be able to see.  E.g. if
I have $HOME/top-secret-projects/secret-code-name1/binary
where the top-secret-projects directory isn't readable by you,
then you may find out secret-code-name1 by reading the
/proc/{pid}/exedir symlink.
