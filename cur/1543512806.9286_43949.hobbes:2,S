Games are unfortunately a great example of the reverse. A good audio mixdown
for a game needs to be good to about 1/100th of a second, and the interchannel
time delays for distant objects need 1/1000th second precision between them.
The latter is doable but the former (and even more so the combination) does
need very good audio/visual synchronization and timing as you are doing audio
mixing within 1/100th of a second of playback - not a big buffer
