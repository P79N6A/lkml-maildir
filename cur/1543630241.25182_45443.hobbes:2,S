I am definitely a newbie as far as patch file handling is concerned.
I took the patch portion starting from
diff -ur 2.4.19-pre8-ac2/Makefile 2.4.19-pre8-ac2-test/Makefile
and ending with
MODVERFILE := $(TOPDIR)/include/linux/modversions.h
which is the last line,
and made it a file named Keith.patch.  Then, I went to /usr/src/linux
and issued
patch -p1 < Keith.patch
Well.... That did not work.  WHat did I do wrong?
Thanks a lot.
