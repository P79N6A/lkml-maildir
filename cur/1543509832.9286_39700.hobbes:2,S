That indicates the machine is still running but a critical component is
hung.  It is probably the disk I/O subsystem, in which case you will
not get any logs written to disk.  If you have another machine nearby,
run a null modem cable, boot Linux with a serial console (see
Documentation/serial-console.txt), capture the Oops on the second
machine and feed it through ksymoops after you reboot.
