Lazyness on my part, I guess. It shouldn't be too hard to implement on
avr32; It looks like the generic code sets a breakpoint on function entry,
so all I have to do is to set a breakpoint on the return address. And
handle the breakpoint somehow. I'll try to implement it when I get back to
work in about a week.
