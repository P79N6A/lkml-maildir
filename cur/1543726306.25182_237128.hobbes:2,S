Disable APIC support and shutdown will work.
Meanwhile, has anyone solved the problem with the Thinkpad-keys after
a suspend/resume?  Volume keys still work, as does the brightness keys,
but Fn+F4 for suspend doesn't (manual suspend still works), and tpb
doesn't see any of the Thinkpad specific keypresses any longer
("Access IBM", Fn+Fx, etc), not even if I restart tpb, and
/proc/interrupts:acpi indicates that interrups are not working for ACPI
any longer.  All other interrupts seem to function properly, and I have
both patches from [1] applied.
