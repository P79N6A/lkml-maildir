Depends where you are talking.  In the conntrack code (and I thought the
rest of the networking code), 0 means "free me now, NOONE has a pointer",
ie. the hash table holds 1.
dcache holds zero-count entries because their semantic requirements are
different, hence the "atomic_dec_and_lock()" stuff.
Cheers!
