Subject: [PATCH] sigprocmask and invalid how parameter
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello,
I was playing around with sigprocmask and found that if the
"how" parameter was bad, the kernel treated it just like a
SIG_SETMASK was passed in except that it returned an error.
I think that it should perform no action if "how" is
invalid.
The attached patch makes the kernel unlock the irq and
leave if how is invalid. The patch was created against a
2.4.18 kernel, but this function hasn't changed. Even the
2.5 kernels look the same for this function.
Best Regards,
-Steve Grubb
