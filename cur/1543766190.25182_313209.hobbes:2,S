Nice, so I now have my own -git tree, with two changes in it...
Is there way to say "git diff -r origin:" but dump it patch-by-patch
with some usable headers?
[Looking at git export]

+You can get git at 
http://pasky.or.cz/~pasky/dev/git/
 . Compile it,
+and place it somewhere in $PATH. Then you can get kernel by running
+
+git init rsync://www.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git
+
+... Run git log to get idea of what happened in tree you are
+tracking. Do git pull linus to pickup latest changes from Linus. You
+can do git diff to see what changes you done in your local tree. git
+cancel will kill any such changes.
+
+You can commit changes by doing git commit... If you want to get diff
+of your changes against mainline, do
+
+git diff -r origin:
