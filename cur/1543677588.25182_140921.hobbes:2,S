I have an ide compact flash device on a couple of machines that reports
dma errors.  In 2.4.20 I was able to set CONFIG_IDEDISK_MULTI_MODE and the
errors went away and all was peachy.
Now the errors are back in 2.4.21, and I noticed that the code that
actually implemented CONFIG_IDEDISK_MULTI_MODE was gone, such that
enabling the option did nothing.
I copied back in the old code from 2.4.20 for the option but I still get
errors, I am guessing that it was removed because something was changed so
that it no longer mattered or something.
So is CONFIG_IDEDISK_MULTI_MODE somehow obsolete or was this an over site?
If CONFIG_IDEDISK_MULTI_MODE is not supposed to matter anymore what should
we do about trying to fix the errors that CONFIG_IDEDISK_MULTI_MODE used
to (set_multimode: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error } & 
set_multimode: error=0x04 { DriveStatusError })?
