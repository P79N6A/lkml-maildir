Try a script to generate a tags file from a list of *.info files (each
node follows a strict format; easily done), and then have your
tags-capable editor (read: vi variant) use control-] and `:tag' on the
node references.  This is simple and works great...no more need for info
and emacs-paradigm junk, and still retaining the nice heirarchical
browsing.
