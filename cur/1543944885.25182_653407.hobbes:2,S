Hmmm... Okay.  mprintk being printk, I'm not too sure how it can go over
usual expectations but well, yeah, that actually is my expectation.

printk is a special case, I think.  It's the primary logging/debugging
method which can't fail and as it's mostly interpreted by human beings
(and developers in problematic cases), it has different maneuvering room
on errors - ie. it's far better to print messages w/o header or proper
log level than failing to print, which is quite different requirements
from other components.
Thanks.
