You are counting wrong. You use an editor to fix configuration files, you
run ifconfig(8) as root to set up networking, etc. They aren't privileged,
the user running them is. Once you take that away, the number of programs
that will need (to be able to get) special privileges will be much larger.
In /sbin:/usr/sbin (very likely candidates) I count 277 here, in /bin
(more, somehwat less likely candidates) I've got 88, and then there will
undoubtedly be others in /usr, /usr/X11/bin, ...

Right. But it is easier to check that the program being audited doesn't
abuse its few extra powers than to check it can't do anything nasty because
no holds are barred being SUID root.
