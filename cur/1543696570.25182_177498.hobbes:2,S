That works for a plain byte-stream on a
local UNIX-style filesystem. (though it
likely isn't the fastest)
It doesn't work for Macintosh files.
It's too slow for CIFS over a modem.
It doesn't work for Windows security data.
It doesn't allow copy-on-write files.
It eats CPU time on compressed filesystems.

So open the file, change context, and then:
long copy_fd_to_file(int fd, const char *name, ...)
(if you can no longer read from the OPEN fd,
either we override that or we just don't care
about such mostly-fictional cases)

If it matters:
// security as if a new file were created
#define CF_REPLACE_SECURITY 0x00000001
// if unable to replicate, up or down?
#define CF_ROUND_SECURITY_UP 0x00000002
#define CF_ROUND_SECURITY_DOWN 0x00000004
// fail if security can't be replicated
#define CF_SECURITY_EXACT 0x00000008

It's slower. (this is Linux, not SunOS)
Use a 4 kB or 8 kB read/write loop.

Buffer management is very much a kernel thing.

Note that /bin/cp isn't always going to have
the necessary passwords and such. You're headed
down a path toward setuid /bin/cp.

Huh? Over the network from server to client
counts as once. Then /bin/cp gets the data.
Then it goes back over the network from the
client to the server. That's "twice". That's
horribly painful for a multi-gigabyte file
and a DSL or cable-modem connection, never
mind a dial-up connection.

Keep the read/write loop small for speed.

Doing that in cp/mv is just insane. For one,
it bypasses any local security control over
access to the filesystem. There's not even a
way to be sure you're dealing with the server
you think you're dealing with.
