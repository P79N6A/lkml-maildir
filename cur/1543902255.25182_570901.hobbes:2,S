They don't work AT ALL for me:
	security/selinux/ss/sidtab.o: In function `netlbl_enabled':
	sidtab.c:(.text+0x0): multiple definition of `netlbl_enabled'
	security/selinux/ss/ebitmap.o:ebitmap.c:(.text+0x0): first defined here
Tssk.
That dummy "netlbl_enabled()" should be "static inline", methinks.
Also, that <net/netlabel.h> file has two blocks after each other of
	#ifdef CONFIG_NETLABEL
	..
	#else
	..
	#endif
	#ifdef CONFIG_NETLABEL
	..
	#else
	..
	#endif
which might as well be cleaned up at the same time (and might have avoided 
this bug, since then the people involved would have seen the _correct_ 
example in the first version)
Please fix up and ask me to pull again. Preferably by actually fixing up 
the commit itself, so that we don't unnecessarily have revisions that 
don't even compile and thus potentially screw up git-bisect attempts.
