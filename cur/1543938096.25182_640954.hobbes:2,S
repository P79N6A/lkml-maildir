Hi Bart,
i just whipped rc8 along with your pata-2.6 tree on top and had several test
runs of the ide-floppy driver (raw reads, software floppy disk eject, etc) and
everything seems to work fine. I will keep this hardware setup here so that we
could at least test ide-floppy occasionally. We should probably acknowledge this
major driver cleanup with a new driver version?
