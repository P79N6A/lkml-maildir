is this the old original aim7 you are running, or osdl-aim-7 or 
re-aim-7?
if it's aim7 then this is a workload that starts+stops 2000 parallel 
tasks that each start and exit at the same time. That might explain its 
sensitivity on the BKL - this is all about tty-controlled task startup 
and exit.
i could not get it to produce anywhere close to stable results though. I 
also frequently get into this problem:
  AIM Multiuser Benchmark - Suite VII Run Beginning
  Tasks    jobs/min  jti  jobs/min/task      real       cpu

system has 2GB of RAM and tmpfs mounted to the place where aim7 puts its 
work files.
