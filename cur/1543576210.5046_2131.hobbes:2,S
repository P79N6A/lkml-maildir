Linus, could you include lvm 0.9 into 2.4.x? It adds snapshot persistence and
it fixes a severe race condition during live extent-reduce.
I ported lvm-0.9 to 2.4.0-test13-pre3 and then I included into it further fixes
that are present in my local tree for a memory leak plus other kiobufs
cleanups and minor things. I also #defined LVM_GET_INODE and undefined the
LVM_HD_NAME so that we don't have to include the check.c lvm_hd_name_ptr
ugliness.
Patch is here:
