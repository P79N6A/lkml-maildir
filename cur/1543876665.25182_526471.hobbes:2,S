Hi Glauber!
	I've been writing documentation, and in the process completely
reorganised and cleaned up this file.  I have also been working on
getting rid of the gratuitous u32's for addresses and trying to cleanse
myself of 32-bit thinking!
	I've now pushed the changes to the repo.  They should simplify this
patch...
Thanks!
Rusty.
