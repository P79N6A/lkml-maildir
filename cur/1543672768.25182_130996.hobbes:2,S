How would the driver differentiate between .compat_ioctl == NULL being a
case where it should fail because there is no translation, or a case
where it should use the compatible .ioctl? Maybe there should be an
extra flag like use_compat_ioctl. So:
	.use_compat_ioctl	= 1;
	.ioctl			= my_ioctl;
	.compat_ioctl		= my_compat_ioctl;
Means use my_compat_ioctl() for translation. And just:
	.use_compat_ioctl	= 1;
	.ioctl			= my_ioctl;
Means that our standard my_ioctl is 32/64 compatible.
This would also solve the current problem where a module that is
compiled with compat ioctl's using register_ioctl32_conversion() is not
usable on a kernel compiled without CONFIG_COMPAT, even though it very
well should be.
