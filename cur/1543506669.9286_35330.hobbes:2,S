ok, crash data is still somewhat vague so i'm working on it.
two different things happen depending on your uid.
tty1: while [ 1 ]; do ls -laR /proc; done
tty2; watch "w;echo;free"
tty3; while [ 1 ]; do ls -laR /proc; done
tty4; top
tty arrangement is irrelevant.
UID0, oopses, crashes, and reboots will happen.
UIDn, processes go D state, WCHAN is 'down_f'
of worthy mention, is when UID0, attempting to do other /proc things
after the oopses begin, often results in Illegal Instruction aborts and
restarting the above results in more oopsing.  frequently the machine
crashes and attempts the automatic reboot.
this is now the second machine i can reproduce /proc bugs on.  last week
i reported D state symptoms for programs using /proc.
