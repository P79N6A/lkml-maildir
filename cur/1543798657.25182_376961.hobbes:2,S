Wrong, at least four: cmf, eckd, err, and a binary only module from EMC.
Now don't hit me for that binary module. But it has been there for 2.4
and we even reserved some ioctl numbers for them (240-255).

Seems resonable. The same could be done for the err module. Doesn't have
to be a module, a config option is enough.

That can easily be fixed by adding a check in the ioctls as well. But
a .ioctl entry in the discipline structure makes sense and would get rid
of all dynamically added ioctls in our code. So I'm all in favor of it.
I would be cautious about ripping out the dynamic ioctls interface
though. I have no idea if there still is an EMC module for 2.6 or other
exploiters. It is an exported interface after all. It is not necessary
to break these exploiters intentionally.
