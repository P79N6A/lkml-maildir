Ahh but there IS a reason for it to be faster: the application knows 
what data it will require, so it should tell the kernel rather than ask 
it to guess.  Even if you had the kernel playing vmsplice games to get 
avoid the copy to user space ( which still has a fair amount of overhead 
), then you still have the problem of the kernel having to guess what 
data the application will require next, and try to fetch it early.  Then 
when the application requests the data, if it is not already in memory, 
the application blocks until it is, and blocking stalls the pipeline.

fdatasync() is not acceptable either because it flushes the entire file. 
  This does not allow the application to control the ordering of various 
writes unless it limits itself to a single write/fdatasync pair at a 
time.  Further, fdatasync again blocks the application.
With aio, the application can keep several read/writes going in 
parallel, thus keeping the pipeline full.  Even if the io were not 
O_DIRECT, and the kernel played vmsplice games to avoid the copy, it 
would still have more overhead, complexity and I think, very little gain 
in most cases.
