This doesn't do what you expect, unfortunately.  You need:
struct futex_hash_bucket {
       spinlock_t              lock;
       struct list_head       chain;
} ____cacheline_aligned_in_smp;
static struct futex_hash_bucket futex_queues[1<<FUTEX_HASHBITS]
	__cacheline_aligned_in_smp;
Also, Jamie was hinting at a sectored approach: optimal memory
footprint/speed balance might be one lock in one cache-line-worth of
list_head.  But the above will do unless someone gets extremely
excited.
Uli, can we ask you for benchmarks with this change, too?
Cheers,
Rusty.
