Let me guess, short explaination in subsequent emails is not enough...
If changelog will be removed, then how people will detect what happend 
after previous release?
Kevent is a generic subsytem which allows to handle event notifications.
It supports both level and edge triggered events. It is similar to
poll/epoll in some cases, but it is more scalable, it is faster and
allows to work with essentially eny kind of events.
Events are provided into kernel through control syscall and can be read
back through mmaped ring or syscall.
Kevent update (i.e. readiness switching) happens directly from internals
of the appropriate state machine of the underlying subsytem (like
network, filesystem, timer or any other).
I will put that text into introduction message.
