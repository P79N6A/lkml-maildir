Well, the following proof of concept patch fixes this issue for me. Please 
notice that original version of e820_mark_nosave_range() could fail to 
exclude some areas due to alignment issues (exactly what happened to me on 
first try) so it still can explain your problem too.

Mark e820 reserved memory areas as nosave for suspend/resume

First, if you want the reserved memory areas to be left alone by swsusp,
you need to mark them as 'nosave'.  On x86_64 this is done by the function
e820_mark_nosave_range() in arch/x86_64/kernel/e820.c that can be ported to
i386 with no problems.  However, we haven't found that very useful, so far,
since no one has ever reported any problems with the current approach,
which is to save and restore them.
=============
The patch adapts x84_64 version to mark as nosave all consequitive
areas. Otherwise in my case the region in question covered only partial
page and was excluded from nosave:
 BIOS-e820: 0000000000000000 - 000000000009fc00 (usable)
 BIOS-e820: 000000000009fc00 - 00000000000a0000 (reserved)
 BIOS-e820: 00000000000e0000 - 00000000000eee00 (reserved)
 BIOS-e820: 00000000000eee00 - 00000000000ef000 (ACPI NVS)
 BIOS-e820: 00000000000ef000 - 0000000000100000 (reserved)
 BIOS-e820: 0000000000100000 - 000000001ef60000 (usable)
 BIOS-e820: 000000001ef60000 - 000000001ef70000 (ACPI data)
 BIOS-e820: 000000001ef70000 - 0000000020000000 (reserved)
 BIOS-e820: 00000000fff80000 - 0000000100000000 (reserved)
The region in question starts at ee800.
