Tarnation!! Ran httperf! Didnt hit it! :(. What were your
settings?
I extracted an old debug patch to implement dropping of
packets - have a sysctl that controls the rate at which I
can drop IP packets, so can also generate any kind of packet
loss..So thought I would bang away with netperf using
sendfile()/TCP_CORK. Thought it was in that code path.
Will be running tests tmrw and the rest of this
week on 2.5.70 +- patch. Will see if I can provoke any
further hangs, stalls, wackiness of any flavor...
thanks,
Nivedita
