I think that was Jan's intention (the patch I sent doesn't change
that aspect of things)...
-if [ "$CONFIG_QUOTA" = "y" -a "$CONFIG_QIFACE_COMPAT" = "y" ]; then
-   choice '    Compatible quota interfaces' \
-       "Original       CONFIG_QIFACE_V1 \
-        VFSv0          CONFIG_QIFACE_V2" Original
So all I've really added is the line:
+   define_bool CONFIG_QUOTACTL y
wrt having both, iirc there was overlap between the original ABI
and Jan's new 32bit one - I suspect thats why both together is
disallowed, but Jan will be able to give the definitive answers
there.
cheers.
