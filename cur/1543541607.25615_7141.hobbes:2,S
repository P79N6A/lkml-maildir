Hi there,
since the appearance of patches against recent kernels (2.4.0-test5-pre)
there is a patchset to get agp support working on those chipsets.
However this wasn't included, it was questioned on this list but to no
avail.
Is the KT-133 and the KX-133 considered to be supported in the future or
not ?
Since AGP and DRI for a modern environment is a must, it would cancel
out the usage of AMD/Via products.
Any comments ?
Regards
Michael Meding
