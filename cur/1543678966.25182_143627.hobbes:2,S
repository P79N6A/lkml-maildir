the amd 760mpx chipset has two pci buses...
One, the Primary PCI 2.2 compliant 66-MHz/64-bit/32-bit PCI Bus is 
connected to the amd 762 north bridge, the Secondary PCI 2.2 compliant 
33-MHz/32-bit PCI Bus is connected to the amd 768 south bridge.
you won't find an mpx with more than 4 32 bit pci slots.
