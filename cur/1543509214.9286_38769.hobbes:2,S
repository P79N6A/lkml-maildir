Andre, you asked what kind of drive I tested with. I tried the following
combinations:
1.
first channel: QUANTUM FIREBALL ST3.2A
second channel: WDC AC313000R (master) and ST52520A
2.
first channel: WDC AC313000R (master) and ST52520A
second channel: unused
3.
first channel: WDC AC313000R
second channel: unused
4.
first channel: ST52520A
second channel: unused
5.
first channel: QUANTUM FIREBALL CR13.0A
second channel: unused
I can only force the problem by stressing the disk (i.e. dd if=/dev/hde).
Currently I only have one disk on it (the small Seagate) and that is part
of a software raid. But if I use the HPT driver the machine will always
crash.
I have noticed that it is much easier to get a problem (i.e. on the first
try) if I combine the test with some tcpblast through a NIC on the same
IRQ as the HPT.
I did not have the same problems with my older Soyo 6KD motherboard and a
HPT on a card. At least I think so, I never stress tested it. At that
time it only had the Seagate on it. But when I use that card on the Abit I
still have problems.
I do not remember if on the Soyo the HPT also shared an IRQ. But I can
reproduce the problem (although it takes more time) without any cards in
the machine (except VGA).
I seem to remember that I get an instant crash when I try to use a CD
drive on the HPT. I can verify this if you want me to.
