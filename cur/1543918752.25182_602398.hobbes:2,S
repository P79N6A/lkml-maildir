It does.  Telling Xen to pin the page as a page table page is
basically the first thing a Xen kernel does after marking the
page read-only.
This makes for a narrow race window, during which ptep_test_and_clear_young
cannot clear the referenced bit and may end up causing a crash.  We do not
care about it not clearing the referenced bit during that window, since it
will be cleared during the next go-around and the race is very rare.
Hence, the only thing we need to fix is the crash.
We can do that by adding an entry for ptep_test_and_clear_young to the
exception table.  This way we do not need to turn this into a new paravirt
ops hook (since the fast path is exactly the same as x86 native) and there
is no need for added complexity.
Also, Xen would not conflict with SPLIT_PTLOCK_CPUS.
