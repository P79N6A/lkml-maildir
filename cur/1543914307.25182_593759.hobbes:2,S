Well the structure is going to be 12 bytes wide. Since pointers have to be 
aligned to 8 bytes we will effectively have to use 16 bytes anyways. There 
is no additional memory use if we would be adding another 4 bytes.
But lets get this merged. We can sort this out later. Too many 
oscillations already.
