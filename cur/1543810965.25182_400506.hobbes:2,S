I'm not used to thinking in these terms :). It would be normally be right, 
except that there will be some LRU pages that will never be freed. These 
would allow suspend2 to work in some (not many) cases where swsusp can't. 
It's been ages since I did the intensive testing on the image preparation 
code, but I think that if we free as much memory as we can, we will always 
still have at least a few hundred LRU pages left. That's not much, but on 
machines with less ram, it might make the difference in a greater percentage 
of cases (compared to machines with more ram)?
If there were other pages that could be safely included in this set, we could 
perhaps make more cases where suspend2 could work but swsusp couldn't. LRU 
was low hanging fruit, and I didn't bother looking beyond it.
