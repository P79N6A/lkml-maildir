just to make sure: this was with -Os _also_ turned on, right? So what 
you measured was the effect of Arjan's patch plus -Os, combined, 
correct?
if yes you should measure the two effects in isolation, like the vmlinux 
numbers i posted. Every patch applied and every change to .config 
options must be measured separately, to get valid results. This doesnt 
invalidate your raw vmlinux measurements - you simply need to add a 
"Arjan's patch applied but no -Os turned on" number - but it does 
invalidate your conclusion quoted above.
