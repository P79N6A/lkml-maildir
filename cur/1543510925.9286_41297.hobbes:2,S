Why don't some of the people here start looking into other solutions
like ClearCase for some of their project needs instead of bitching and
moaning about the alternatives?
From interactions and reputations of Mr. McVoy, I am fairly confident
he will generate a good product when it is ready... it still amazes me
that software people whine about their not being a product out there,
when they should know that you cann't give a hard deadline that this
software will be written and done on a such and such a date... if you
believe in the architecture, you are going to have to wait until an
implentation that matches the design is ready to go, so take some
valium and explore the alternatives until the product is ready.
