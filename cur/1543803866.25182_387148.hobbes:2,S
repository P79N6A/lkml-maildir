I seem to have missed this last e-mail (I was moving around that time...).
This is indeed how it's been done in other drivers. I just uploaded this "patch"
into my -mm test tree. Within a week or two I'll move it to the final watchdog tree.
We should look to the struct watchdog part in more detail though.
a union is an option, but probably not the only one :-)
Greetings,
Wim.
