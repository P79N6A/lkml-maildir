yes.  but the point is (according to reports I have received) that the
object code (without source code) was available for download on the
crossmeta website. 
Therefore anyone could have obtained a binary copy with no included
source code, and thus the 'any third party' clause implicitly comes into
effect.
As soon as you've even only once given a copy of the executable code
without at the same time including the full corresponding source code,
"any third party" is entitled to obtain a copy of the source code.
