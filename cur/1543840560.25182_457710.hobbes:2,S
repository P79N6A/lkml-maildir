1) What makes ipath special so that we want this warning for ipath
devices but not other IB hardware?  If this warning is actually
useful, then I think it would make more sense to start a timer when
any IB device is added, and warn if ports with a physical link don't
become active after the timeout time.  But I'm having a hard time
seeing why we want this message in the kernel log.
2) You do cancel_delayed_work() but not flush_scheduled_work(), so
it's possible for your timeout function to be running after the module
text is gone.
