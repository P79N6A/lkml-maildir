(Also EISA, Cardbus, MCA, Zorro, Nubus...) ISA is almost an odd man out.
Parallel port devices can report an identity now days as can serial devices.
Unfoertunately the parallel ident probe freaks some raw parallel port
hacks (ie parallel ide devices, b/w quickcam etc) and the serial one is
notorious for doing things like turning off UPS systems when it waggles the
carrier.
