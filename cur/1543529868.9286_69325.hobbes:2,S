It's better than the current system, which amounts to "kill processes at
random until there's some free memory again."

If your watchdog monitors memory usage and corrects problems, then the
kernel OOM handler will never be invoked.
I want to emphasise this point: the OOM handler should **NEVER** be
invoked. If it is ever needed, there is something BADLY wrong with the
system - either we do something drastic (process slaughtering) or the
machine goes down completely. Worrying about which user processes are
killed to avoid an uncontrolled failure is a case of rearranging the
deckchairs on the Titanic.

If your watchdog is dying, then you have some big problems there. Either
it is killing itself for some reason, or you have *very* big problems with
the other software, or the machine's hardware. (Malicious users, perhaps?)
