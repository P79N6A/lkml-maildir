Yeah, there's more sharing that could be done... though I don't think the 
fb layer has the bits to actually grab EDIDs.  Also, DRM is shared with 
BSD...

Yep, pretty trivial stuff.

I agree that would be better.  I'll see what I can do to unify the two.

I think the original tries a few times... but it's still buggy.  I've got 
an old EDID 1.1 monitor whose EDID block is fetched by X but not by this 
code (or the original FB code) so I think we still have some timing bugs 
to fix.

Fixed, thanks.

Oops, I'll fix that too.
At this point though, the drm_fb driver isn't actually used.  I recently 
added the intel_fb driver (mostly using code from intelfb) so we could 
have an accelerated DRM FB driver, hopefully that one's ok.
Thanks for looking at it.
