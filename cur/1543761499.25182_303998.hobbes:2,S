This is a relief!  I was wondering how on earth I was going to solve
the multi-task priority-inheritance problem!
But...  How do we handle the following scenario?
0.	A bunch of low-priority threads are preempted in the
	middle of various RCU read-side critical sections.
1.	High-priority thread does kmalloc(), but there is no
	memory, so it blocks.
2.	OOM handling notices, and decides to clean up the outstanding
	RCU callbacks.  It therefore invokes _synchronize_kernel()
	(in implementation #5).
3.	The _synchronize_kernel() function tries to acquire all of
	the read-side locks, which are held by numerous preempted
	low-priority threads.
4.	What now???
Or does the current patch do priority inheritance across the memory
allocator?  In other words, can we get away with ignoring this one?  ;-)
						Thanx, Paul
