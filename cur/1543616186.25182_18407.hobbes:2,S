OK, just two comments:
- As you'll have to patch all drivers anyway, in case Richard Gooch 
  doesn't have a problem with this suggestion, I'd suggest you patch 
  the kernel as follows:
  (1) drivers/char/tty_io.c

        return buf;
 }

        serial_driver.name = "ttyS";

  I've already suggested this in a previous msg, but nobody gave 
  feedback. I believe this is cleaner, as it removes the %d from 
  the driver.name field, while fixes the problem I reported.
- Since you'll patch the Cyclades driver, could you please add the 
  ifdef's for devfs?? The definitions are as follows:
   - Callin devices: "tts/C%d" for devfs, "ttyC%d" for non-devfs.
   - Callout devices: "cua/C%d" for devfs, "cub%d" for non-devfs 
     (no, this is NOT a typo, it's really cua/C and cub).
  I ask this just to avoid sending a separate patch just for that. 
  I'd really appreciate it if you could do it along with your patch. 
  If you don't do it, no problem either.
Anyhow, thanks to all for the attention to this issue, and especially 
to you, Andrew!
Later,
