I heard about 2.2.8 correcting some problems with generic NE2000
clones and SMP and happily upgraded kernel, unfortunately, the LAN was
not detected when I booted 2.2.8!  This is booting with 2.2.7
May 13 20:23:37 moscito kernel: NE*000 ethercard probe at 0x340: 00 80 c8 35 ec a6
May 13 20:23:37 moscito kernel: eth0: NE2000 found at 0x340, using IRQ 10.
This is booting with 2.2.8
May 13 20:32:38 moscito kernel: NE*000 ethercard probe at 0x340: failed to detect IRQ line.
My equipment: Micro-Star 6120, 440BX with two PII/400's; 512MB of RAM;
DE-220 (NE2000 clone) NIC (don't tell me, the network is on coaxials);
AHA-3985 3-channel SCSI2 with three SCSI drives and an MO.
