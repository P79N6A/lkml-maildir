You're right. Maybe you could return -ve or with a high bit set,
but I guess you may not know what the app will return.
But I don't see how the volatile or pipe solutions are any better
though: it would seem that both result in undefined behaviour
according to my vfork man page. At least the wait() solution is
defined (and workable, if you know what the target might return).

Yeah, thinko.
