Version 2.5.3 of perfctr, the Linux/x86 performance
monitoring counters driver, is now available at the usual
place: 
http://www.csd.uu.se/~mikpe/linux/perfctr/
x86_64 is now supported in kernels 2.5.69, 2.4.21-rc2, and
RawHide's 2.4.20-9.2 (GinGin64 RH 8.0.95 preview). Successfully
tested on a dual Opteron box. The x86_64 control data is
different than the x86 control data (P5 and P4 control has
been removed), so applications must be recompiled for x86_64.
Version 2.5.3, 2003-05-16
- Added support for the Pentium M processor. It is mostly like
  a Pentium III with some more events, except that six old
  Pentium III / Pentium Pro events have been redefined.
- Added support for K8 in 64-bit mode (the x86_64 kernel arch).
  Updated driver, user-space library, and example programs.
  The shared library libperfctr.so is now compiled with -fPIC.
- K8 bug fix in examples/signal/signal.c: a missing INT flag
  caused the driver to reject the control setup.
- P4 event descriptions updated from recent documentation changes.
