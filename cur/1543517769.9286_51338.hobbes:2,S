Forgive me if I'm asking elementary questions, but shouldn't
uninterruptible processes show up in ps listing in other state as
R(unning)?
As I've understood it, sigkill can only be ineffective if the process is 
in zombie or uninterruptable state:  
(man ps)
       D   uninterruptible sleep (usually IO)
       R   runnable (on run queue)
       S   sleeping
       T   traced or stopped
       Z   a defunct ("zombie") process
