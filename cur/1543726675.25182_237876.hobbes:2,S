Subject: [PATCH 0/5] Concurrent O_SYNC write speedups using radix-tree walks
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/8/1/12

The attached patches (generated against 2.6.8-rc2) enable concurrent 
O_SYNC writers to different parts of the same file by avoiding 
serialising on i_sem across the wait for IO completion.
This is mostly your work, ported to the tagged radix tree VFS changes
and a few fixes. I have been carrying these patches for sometime now; 
they can be the merged upstream. Please apply.
Regards
Suparna
