Hi Andrew,
I know that hdparm shows udma2 mode selected for data transfers, but 
check that dma is *actually* turned on.  ie:  hdparm -d1 /dev/hdd
I don't remember exactly when this went in, but there were some IDE 
patches around the 2.6.11 or so timeframe that seemed to change the way 
these devices get setup at boot.  I believe this happened when the 
autotune= syntax was deprecated.  HTH,
-Walt
