You'll need to enable additional SCSI logging to determine what is going
on here.  The aic7xxx driver doesn't care about lun numbers really, and
doesn't have any code to "willy-nilly" reject some subset of luns just
because one was not probed.  What I really need to see is what error
code was returned by the aic7xxx driver when the attempt to probe the
"not found" lun occurs.  You should be able to instrument the non
"hardcoded" section of drivers/scsi/scsi_scan.c:scan_scsis() to get
this information.
