This is very inefficient if the bond slaves don't
support these features.
I believe you when you say you saw improvement in the
case where the slaves do support TSO, but if you test
a non-TSO slave case I bet you'll see a marked
decrease in system utilization at least.
...
Note: 2.6.2 patch enables Zero Copy Transmit support by default while
registering the bond device... but, I continue to see better CPU
utilization (~50% improvement) when this patch was tested in various
scenarios(see data below). Test results are from a dual Itanium 2 1.4GHz
system but I saw a similar trend on a PIII Xeon 550MHz x 8 system.
