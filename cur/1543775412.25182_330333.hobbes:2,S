Does not look like it:
3c. No encryption and/or steganography for the purpose of
circumventing Streamload's rules.
... For example, if you'd like to encrypt something for an extra sense
of security and privacy, please feel free to do so. However, when
these tools are used solely for the purpose of circumventing
Streamload's rules, as determined by the sole discretion of
Streamload, the files will be deleted.
