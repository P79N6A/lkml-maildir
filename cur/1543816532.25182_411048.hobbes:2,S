Yes, VMWare doesn't support serial port using host's ttys any more. My
idea is:
[host - application] <- read/write -> [virtual serial port
/dev/ttyFakeS0] <- read/write over virtual null-modem serial cable ->
[host - real serial port /dev/ttyS0] <- read/write -> [VMWare - application]
But today I've just bought an USB-to-Serial converter and made for
myself a null-modem serial cable. I use this null-modem cable to connect
/dev/ttyS0 (native serial port) to /dev/tts/USB0 (USB-based serial
port). My VMWare now can use one of those devices and the host use
another one. Now above figure can be re-drawn like this:
[host - application] <- read/write -> [/dev/tts/USB0] <- read/write over
physical null-modem cable -> [/dev/ttyS0] <- read/write -> [VMWare -
application]
Anyway, later I'll try to write a device drivers act as virtual serial
ports and virtual null-modem cables.
Best regards,
Mikado.
