Agreed, it's more elegant.

Probably not too hard, but you have to convince John Coffman that it's
worth doing (or send him a patch :-) I've written an ELF loader for
bootimg(8), and it wasn't too difficult:
ftp://icaftp.epfl.ch/pub/people/almesber/misc/bootimg-8.tar.gz
BTW, my plan is currently to put in place an infrastructure based on
bootimg, which should be much more suitable for any advanced booting
games than extensions to existing boot loaders or kernel-swallows-
user-space hacks like nfsroot. Right now I'm working on getting
newlib to do what I want. Well, I'm actually almost there:
ftp://icaftp.epfl.ch/pub/people/almesber/misc/newlib-linux/
(main missing features: need more tools (mount, chroot, etc.), no
networking, "configure" doesn't like my environment).
