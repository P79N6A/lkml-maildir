Really?  Even in "obviously buggy code"?

Funny, that.  "several days" in this case boils down to grep for accesses
to that field in driver (and stuff #included from it).  Which yields exactly
one assignment (in ->open()).  Combined with understanding that
	a) ->open() is definitely going to be executed before any calls of
->read() and
	b) nothing in generic code ever touches ->private_data
	c) if rme96xx_open() returns 0, it will leave us with non-NULL
->private_data.
Five minutes total.  And no, "fix" did not give more correct code -
in all cases it yields exactly the same behaviour.  All it does is
	* shifting what in effect is if (0) {do something odd} from
one place to another
	* making the warning go away
Note that warning had (correctly) pointed to fishy logics in the driver.
Shutting it up and leaving the real problem intact (and hidden) is
not particulary useful.

"Remove bogus checks".
