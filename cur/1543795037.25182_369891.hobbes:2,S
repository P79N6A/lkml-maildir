Hi,
I made e1000 ( or for that matter anything) a part of the 2.6.15-rc1
kernel and booted the kernel. Next I compiled e1000 as a module (
e1000.ko ), and tried to insmod it into the kernel( which already had
e1000 a compiled as a part of the kernel). I observed that
/proc/kallsyms contained two copies of all the symbols exported by
e1000, and I also got a Kernel Panic on the way.
Is this behaviour natural and desirable ?
Regards and Thanks
