Hi,
Just built 2.3.51 (if you just read my previous message, I built it
without parallel port support this time), and had this problem:
[1.] One line summary of the problem:    
mount doesn't recognize my superblock, at least the first time it tried
[2.] Full description of the problem/report:
On bootup, mount would not recognize my root partition and refused to
mount it.  I rebuilt the kernel and tried again, and it hasn't failed yet.
I had accidentally deleted my .config, so I don't know if I changed
something inadvertently the second build.  (Sorry!!!)  Specifically, I
don't remember if I inadvertently left plug and play support enabled on
the first try.  I'll test with plug and play and repost if it reproduces
the problem.
Disk is IDE, not SCSI, on primary master on-board IDE controller.  dmesg
says:
Uniform Multi-Platform E-IDE driver Revision: 6.30
ide: Assuming 40MHz system bus speed for PIO modes; override with
idebus=xx

and hda is, of course, the device in question.
