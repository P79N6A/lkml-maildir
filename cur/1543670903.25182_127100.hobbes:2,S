Well the source has several errors. I fixed a couple and made
the jump (temporarily) a fixed-length jump. The remaining error
is the improper construction of the label "vector", which needs
to be fixed and I need to take a work-break. I think all you
need to do is pre-define it, i.e., like the following:
NR_IRQS = 32
.if NR_IRQS > 16			# only build this for IO-APIC
	.align 8,0x90			# make ENTRY have exact address
irq_align=8				# start with 8-byte alignment
#ENTRY(high_irq_entries_start)
vector = 0;                             # Define as a variable, not label
.rept NR_IRQS-16			# the rest of the stubs
	.align irq_align,0x90
1:	pushl $vector		# 5-byte instruction
	ljmp common_interrupt		# 2 or 5 bytes (8 or 32-bit offset)
2:
.if 2b-1b > 8				# offset changed to 32-bit
	irq_align=16			# switch to 16-byte alignment
.endif
.data
	.long 1b
.text
vector=vector+1
.endr
.endif
