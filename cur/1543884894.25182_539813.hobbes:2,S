Nothing to do with win32 functions.  Windows does NOT create sparse  
files therefore it never can have an issue like ext3 does in this  
scenario.  Windows will cause nice allocations to happen because of  
this and the 1-byte writes are perfectly sensible in this regard.   
(Although a little odd as Windows has a proper API for doing  
preallocation so I don't get why it is not using that instead...)
As far as I know the only time Windows will create sparse files is if  
you specifically mark a file as sparse using the FSCTL_SET_SPARSE  
ioctl and then create a sparse region using the FSCTL_SET_ZERO_DATA  
ioctl.
Best regards,
