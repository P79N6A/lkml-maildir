They all have dates, that's one hint, and they all should apply with no
patch rejects, that's another hint.  You're right that this still
doesn't make it possible to create exactly the same tree as the BK tree
but it makes it possible to create a useful tree.
You are also right that figuring out the merges is a pain.  So what?
We never said that we'd figure out how to do all this well and then
teach you how to do it well.
