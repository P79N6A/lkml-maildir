Ouch indeed this quick'n'dirty patch was, let's call it a full mistake
:) sorry for that, it could indeed not be tested as i don't have the
hardware.
Still, is it safe to compare two variable with different types anyway ?
In 
http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-pcmcia/2004-March/000586.html
they also have the same issue, they just do
s/ foo > 0xffff / foo & ~0xffff /
should not it solve the problem as well ?
Sorry again for the first patch, next time i'll just shut up.
Regards,
Cédric
