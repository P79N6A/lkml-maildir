Not in this case. memmap is allocated node local and mapped in the virtual
memory area normally occupied by the end of low memory. The objective was
to have memmap for the struct pages node-local. Hence, portions of
memmap are really in highmem.

I'll have to take your word for it because I haven't looked closely
enough. I'll try and find time to look at it but the earliest I'll get around
to it is post kernel-summit. In the meantime, SPARSEMEM works.
