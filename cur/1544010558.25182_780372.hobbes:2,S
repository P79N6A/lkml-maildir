Subject: [PATCH 31/36] KVM: x86 emulator: Fix handling of VMMCALL instruction
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/14/31

From: Amit Shah <amit.shah@redhat.com>
The VMMCALL instruction doesn't get recognised and isn't processed
by the emulator.
This is seen on an Intel host that tries to execute the VMMCALL
instruction after a guest live migrates from an AMD host.
