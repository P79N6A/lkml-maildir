Hello Kernel folks!
I just compiled 2.3.41 SMP on my computer with just one P2-CPU installed.
First I tried compiling with "Loadable module support -> Set version
information on all module symbols" enabled, which was ok. But after
booting kmodd complained about missing symbols for unix.o: kernel_flag
This was defined in /System.map.
I check with "ksyms -a | grep kernel_flag" which only found the symbol
kernel_flag__R_xxxx.
After disabling the above option compilation was also ok and loading
unix.o went fine. Enabling the option again and starting from zero and the
missing symbol went away again.
Then I tried loading usb-uhci.o which slowed down my machine. A look at
/proc/interrupts showed the problem:
 11:          0   IO-APIC-edge  usb-uhci
 19:    3557778   IO-APIC-level  eth0
NMI:      33528
LOC:      33511
ERR:          0
My computer is currently NOT connected to any network. 2 seconds later
after unloading:
 19:    4150135   IO-APIC-level  eth0
NMI:      35626
LOC:      35609
ERR:          0
Looks like thosw 1M interrupts from usb were routed to my ethernet-card.
Those 35k NMIs are also strange.
Any ideas? Do you need additional information?
