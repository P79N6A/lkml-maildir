I know he's in the CC:, but I'm not sure he's reading this thread, and
I'm hesitant to bother people about things out of the blue unless I have
reason to expect that it's something they're going to care about. (Just
because it's a big deal for me doesn't mean it makes one whit of
difference to anyone else, and from what little I've seen on
linux-kernel he seems to be somewhat important and fairly busy...)

Then I suppose I'm reduced to browsing the Kconfig files, reading old
changelogs, and trying a lot of different configs... thanks anyway.
