I actually talked about that further down.  The short version: quite
far.
The long version:
It leaves a bunch of hung processes, with no real way for me to
determine which processes are hung on the now-non-existent mount,
and (at least with autofs) it leaves /etc/mtab in an inconsistent
state, so I had to edit it to restart autofs.  Only a mild
improvement on rebooting, says I.
Also, it took a really long time (minutes) to return.

I don't think that would solve the problem: the umount -f would
still hang and eventually return busy, fuser would still hang, and
umount -l would still leave inconsistent crap lying around.

I have no opinion on interface details, I simply know that on
Solaris, "umount -f" Just Works, and I would love to have similar
behaviour on Linux.
