I fully agree with Oliver.  It's an abomination.

Aha.  So you lose the S_ISCHR/BLK attribute.

Directories are not allowed to be read from/written to.  The VFS may
support it, but it's not (current) UNIX.

So with your definition, I have a fs-object that is marked as a directory
but opening it opens a device.  Pretty nice.  How I'm supposed to list
it's contents?  open+readdir?  But the open has nasty side effects.
So you have a directory that you are not allowed to list (because of the
possible side effects) but is allowed to be read from/written to maybe
even issue ioctls to?.  And you call that sane???
IMO the whole idea of arguments following the device name is junk (incl
a "/ctrl").
Just think about the implications of the original "/dev/ttyS0/19200"
suggestion.  It sounds nice and tempting.  But which programs will
benefit.  Which gets confused.  What will be cleaned up.  After some
thoughts you'll find out that it's useless ;-)
And with special "ctrl" devices (ie /dev/ttyS0 and /dev/ttyS0ctrl):
This _may_ work for some kind of devices.  But serial ports are one
example where it simply will _not_.  It requires that you know the
name of the device.  For ttys this is often not the case.  Even if
you manage to get some name for stdin for example - now I should
simply attach a "ctrl" to that name to get a control channel???
At least dangerous.  If I'm lucky I only get an EPERM...
Ciao, ET.
