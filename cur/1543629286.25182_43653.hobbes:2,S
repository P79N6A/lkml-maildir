Aha! I added noapic to kernel command line and it started to work:

Without noapic, the output from previous email was with MP 1.1. With
MP 1.4 kernel hangs somewhere near "calibrating APIC timer". With
noapic it seems to work with both 1.1 and 1.4.
I'll take a look at the doc you mentioned. Thank you.
