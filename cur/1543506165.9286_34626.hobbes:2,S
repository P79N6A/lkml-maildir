There was a port of BSD Net-2 a few years ago, which was never part of
the standard kernel.
I suspect there's still a lot of confusion because of Linux net2 ---
which was *not* related to BSD Net-2; it was simply the second version
of Linux's TCP/IP stack.  The first version was of course net1, and the
current one is net3 if the bootup messages can be believed.  But even
when it was current, an awful lot of people seemed to assume that Linux
net2 was BSD Net-2 when in fact it was completely unrelated.

    We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
