  Yes, it previously accidentally worked this way (for an year or so,
before that we refused to remount read-only). Hmm, but maybe we could
somehow tweak quotas to be turned on when remounting read-write again.
We have all the information we need at the time of remounting read-only
so we could store it and use it later when remounting read-write. I'll have
a look into that.

  On the other hand when you umount the filesystem, quotas are
automatically turned off and when you mount it again, they are not enabled.
So the behavior as I've changed it is consistent as well... But probably
what I wrote above is the safest solution.
