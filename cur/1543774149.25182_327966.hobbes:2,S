Right. Which breaks udev. Hence I say that if you're looking at "size of
devfs versus udev for solution X" and your devfs solution doesn't require
sysfs, then sysfs should be included in the size of udev for the sake of
the comparison.
Before anyone asks, that's not to say that sysfs is useless in a devfs
setting, merely that it's not required in most whereas it is required
for udev to even work.
