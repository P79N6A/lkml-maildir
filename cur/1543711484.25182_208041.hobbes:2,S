Exactly the same here on Debian/Unstable 2.6.5-rc2.
Though I can't say it locks up on. Remove modules manually
rmmod ehci_hcd
rmmod ohci_hcd
Usually it takes some time and eventually rmmod returns successfully
removing modules !
In my case when system boots up - USB mouse is not working. 
If I remove and reinstaer ehci_hcd and ohci_hcd - everything seems fine.
$ ps -C rmmod -o pid,uid,state,wchan=WIDE-WCHAN-COLUMN
  PID   UID S WIDE-WCHAN-COLUMN
 1844     0 D usb_disable_device
 2209     0 D rwsem_down_write_failed
Perhaps that will help ...
