So for a low end video card you want to put a full software opengl es
stack into the kernel including the rendering loops which tend to be
large and slow, or dynamically generated code ?

That would be most of them for a lot of chips because the hardware can
only do "most" of the work, eg using software fixups after a rendering
command or splitting GL commands into a chain of simpler ones as Mesa
does. All large code.

You mean move the X server from being root (privileged) to kernel (even
more privileged) and pray there are no bugs in it ?
Bits of the model are right - look at DRI for some (perhaps not pretty)
evidence of that. Clearly the kernel needs to control the GPU, DMA and
access to buffers. It isn't clear anything higher level belongs anywhere
but user space.
