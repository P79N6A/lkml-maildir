I'm going to try that and tell you the results, but I think there's
something deeper going on: if this was the only problem, the oops
would only happen in a 'crashme' process, but the oops I sent happens
in find (why would find get a hangup ?), but I also got it in cat (in
while true; do find / ! -fstype nfs -type f -print0 | xargs -n0 cat;
done), or in syslogd...
