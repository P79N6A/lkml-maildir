Hmmm... mlockall() seems to do what I want... (Probably even overkill.
mlock() should be able to do the job, and not locking non RT stuff.) Or
does man 2 mlockall lie? (About the stack.)

Unloaded system? Not good enough. How to do multitrack hard disk
recording then?
In theory, it's no problem separating RT from non RT, and RTLinux
already does so, and works in real life. As long as the CPU, the RAM and
the hardware directly involved doesn't disappear in a cloud of smoke
every now and then, RT performance will be delivered.
Hacking a nice solution is another matter...
