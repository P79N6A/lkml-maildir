What prevents a rogue user to call this function a number of times to 
waste resources?
kcalloc() covers only small part of what is needed to make an interface 
secure, once one checked everything else, the safety provided by kcalloc() 
is pretty much redundant.
Relying on the current allocation limits would be rather foolish as these 
can change anytime and hardcoding such assumptions is a really bad idea. 
Kernel coding requires a careful use of the memory resource, so it's the 
job of the driver to define reasonable limits, e.g. such arrays don't make 
much sense if they require too much space and the driver should define a 
limit like (PAGESIZE/sizeof(struct foo)). If the driver writer doesn't 
think about memory usage, then kcalloc() will do pretty much nothing too 
improve the driver, it may avoid a few problem cases, but there will be 
certainly more than enough problems left.
I actually looked at the current kcalloc users and besides a few unchecked 
module parameters, the arguments were either constant or had to be checked 
anyway. I didn't find a single example which required the "safety" of 
kcalloc().
bye, Roman
