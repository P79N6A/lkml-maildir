So basically just having the marker implementation there to let all
tracers access to irqs enabled/disabled.
One problem is that the hooks are alse in entry.S, so the tracing ends up
being architecture dependent. One solution is to have a "generic" hook for
trace_hardirqs_on/off (kind of like what I did here) and add a marker
inside that. The hooks in entry.S can call the generic function and have
the marker call the registered probes, be that lockdep, latencytap or
latency-trace.
Have the generic hook only be compiled in when one of the tracers or
lockdep is configured on and they select it.
