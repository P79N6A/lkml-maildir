As far as I know in the old times this was the *standard* way to use a modem
(per CCITT V24), and even nowadays many modems can handle this method for
transmit, to stay compatible with the standard.
Think of radio modems. Some are inherently half duplex.

No, no, they apply an old standard. Probably they are old as well.

It's a pity that Linux (or Unixes) never handled RTS this way.
I feel that the /proc or sysfs solutions are the best to alter this well
established default in this driver. It would not break existing installed
hardware.
