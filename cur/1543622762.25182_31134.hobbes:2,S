I've encountered this problem before, too.  What is the "One True Way"
to do this cleanly?  In other words, if you want to do a calculation
once every time someone runs "cat /proc/foo", what is the cleanest way
to do that?  The solution we came up with was to check the file offset
and only do the calculation if offset == 0, which seems pretty
hackish.
