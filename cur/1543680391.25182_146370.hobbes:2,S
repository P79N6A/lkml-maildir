Can you elaborate on the matter of virtual vs physical VM scan? Am I
correct concluding this has to do with rmap?

If there is even an experimental patch then I will be happy to try it out,
it's probably has a lesser effect when you enough ram, but currently
that's the reason I still avoid using development kernels on that box.
