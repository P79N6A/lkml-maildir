Not sure if I have my configurations correct, but after
pulling the latest git, I notice that my mixer has no switch to mute
the "front", or external speaker on a macbook pro(ati chipset);
other than that the sound sounds really good.
(solution I guess: plug-in headphones, and mute headphone option);
