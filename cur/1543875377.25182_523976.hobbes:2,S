I don't think so - the message (as Alan also said) tells the user that the
intended adjustment is *not* being done, kind of as a warning. I would
agree, though, that the flags adjustment (namely, adding
IORESOURCE_IO) is somewhat questionable; this isn't a change the
patch did, though, it was that way already before. But otoh with the
legacy flag set in progif, these BARs *should* be I/O ones...
