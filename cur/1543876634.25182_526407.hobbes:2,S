The implementation wouldn't need to use PCI at all. There wouldn't 
even need to be PCI like registers internally. Just a pci device
with an ID somewhere in sysfs. PCI with unique IDs
is just a convenient and well established key into the driver module
collection. Once you have the right driver it can do what it wants.
