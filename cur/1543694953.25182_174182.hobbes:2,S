I applied these patches to stock 2.6.0-test8 and selected 'demandbased' as
default governor. In result, everything worked from the very beginning, my
Centrino-based system went to 600MHz and was upping when load was going
higher during compilation or disk access but went down when load was
lowering. So it works well for me.
