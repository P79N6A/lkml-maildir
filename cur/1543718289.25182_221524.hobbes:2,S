The serial driver is not at fault.  It's processing exactly as it is asked
to.  The kernel's console logic is causing the problem. (in fact, there
are specific checks to make sure there aren't two CPUs attempting to
write to the serial registers at the same time.)
It looks like somewhere in the path of release_console_sem() more than
one CPU is running the log.  The "printk_cpu" patch might fix this.  I'll
konw in a day (the box crashs every night... the jack***'s turn the AC
off after 6pm everyday.)
