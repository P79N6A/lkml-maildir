Russell, be serious.
I've been doing this for more than 10 years, using my measly
workstation as my mail server for everything, and being VGER
postmaster on top of it all, and I never have this problem and
I think I get tons more email than you ever will.
Just becuase you want to run your mail server on a machine with very
limited resources, doesn't make it reasonable to hijack the headers on
everyone else like you do.
