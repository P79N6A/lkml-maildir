I'm not sure, but I would suspect it might, yes, at least on some 
platforms and configurations. However, this unlikely to be a serious 
problem, since any kernel code that executed a callback method which 
could be a NULL without checking for that would blow up the system in 
the vast majority of cases where nothing was mapped at address 0.
