I went through the kernels i still have on this box (FSC LifeBook E8110) 
and here are the results. Except the debian 2.6.18-5-686 no newer kernel 
works. The onboard bluetooth works like a charm always whereas the
bcm203x simply does not reconnect after loading firmware from 2.6.19 on.
	2.6.18-5-686 (debian)	works
	2.6.19			breaks
	2.6.21-rc5		breaks
	2.6.22-rc5		breaks
	2.6.22-2-686 (debian)	breaks
	2.6.23-1-686 (debian)	breaks
	2.6.24			breaks
It basically looks always like this:
	<insert>
		usb 1-1: new full speed USB device using uhci_hcd and address 2
		usb 1-1: configuration #1 chosen from 1 choice
		Bluetooth: Broadcom Blutonium firmware driver ver 1.1
		usbcore: registered new interface driver bcm203x
	<wait for 30 seconds - then pull>
		bcm203x_complete: URB failed with status -84
		usb 1-1: USB disconnect, address 2
