Hi Linus - please push these fixes.
2 kbuild related fixes:
o kbuild: fix make O=
o kbuild: use lds.* infrastructure in arch/i386/kernel/Makefile
The first one shows up only when using make O= poiting to a fresh directory tree.
The good thing is that it showed that some people actually uses O= ;-)
Thanks to you who reported this issue.
The second one was Rusty deciding to preprocess a lds.S file, in parallel
with me adding the new infrastructure.
Please pull:

Patches as follow-up to this mail.
