All correct.

No, the dependency relationships alone do not carry enough information.
  I am aware of that.
For example, we certainly want groupings or tags such as "option is
(directly) related to USB hardware", "filesystems related option",
"option is for debugging purposes" etc..  We currently provide hints
like this via the 'menu' keyword.  We also want help texts per option
and per group of options.
However, there is ultimately not a single most logical way to group
options.  There could be groups which would overlap.  The grouping per
'menu' provides only one fixed non-overlapping grouping.
