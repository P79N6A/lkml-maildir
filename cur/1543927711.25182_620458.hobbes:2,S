With the aid of a dictionary I was able to understand about half the 
words in the last sentence.  Moving from device to device using 
hotplug+multipath is complex to configure, available on only some 
guests, uses rarely-exercised paths in the guest OS, and only works for 
a few types of devices (network and block).  Having host independence in 
the device means you can change the device implementation for, say, a 
display driver (consider, for example, a vmgl+virtio driver, which can 
be implemented in userspace or tunneled via virtio-over-tcp to some 
remote display without going through userspace, without the guest 
knowing about it).
