You no longer need to go through this pain - we plan on dropping gcc-2.95
support this cycle, so anonymous unions and anonymous structs can be used
in-kernel.
The above looks a bit dodgy wrt endianness..

Are those casts needed?
ioc3uart_intr_one() has two callsites and should not be inlined.  Although
the compiler could conceivably do something sneaky with it.  Needs checking.
nic_read_bit() should be uninlined.
nic_write_bit() should be uninlined.
write_ireg() should be uninlined.
This driver will break when tty-layer-buffering-revamp.patch is merged,
which looks like it'll be 1-2 weeks hence.  A fixup patch against next -mm
would suit..
