this got me quite a bit further:

 81450b73dde07f473a4a7208b209b4c8b7251d90 is first bad commit
[ note: by having the "git-bisect must-have-bugfix f3ccb06f" 
  functionality i mentioned in the previous mail git-bisect could
  have eliminated the fake-good steps. ]
it's not a resolution of this regression yet, because this commit is a 
merge with upstream:
|  commit 81450b73dde07f473a4a7208b209b4c8b7251d90
|  Merge: 8a03d9a... 0539771...
|  Author: Len Brown <len.brown@intel.com>
|  Date:   Fri Feb 16 18:52:41 2007 -0500
|
|      Pull misc-for-upstream into release branch
which means that the fix in Len's tree got broken by merging with 
upstream. Note: this 'upstream' in isolation is broken too, due to not 
having that essential fix from Len's tree!
So we quite likely have /two/ bugs, any of which breaks resume (which 
breakage looks the same, so no way to isolate them via testing).
I'll now try the following: i'll try to manually apply Len's fix to 
every tree that git-bisect offers me, in the hope of being able to 
isolate the /other/ bug.
[ But really, i'm not expecting any miracles because this is way out of
  league for git-bisect which really depends on only having a binary 
  space to search for. ]
