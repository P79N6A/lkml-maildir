I've been seeing the exact same thing (and posted about it once
before).  Same log entries at boot time, random machine lockups, except
mine seem to be around 2 days apart.  I have had them with 2.2.0-pre9,
2.2.0, 2.2.1 and 2.2.2-pre4.  I haven't installed 2.2.2-pre5 yet.  I ran
2.2.0-pre[5678] for their duration and had no problems.  The only common
thing between them all is that my IDE drive light is on, I'm always
running X, and when I reboot, I must cycle power to get my BIOS to
autodetect a hard drive (one I used to move around).
I have upgraded X from 3.3.2 to 3.3.3.
I have not a clue how to catch this bugger in action, because there is
not a bit of evidence left behind and it doesn't appear to depend on
anything I am doing at the time.  I have tried to duplicate things,
several times, but cannot make it repeat.  It was suggested that there
might be a connection between ddd and this crash, but I've ruled that
out.
If anybody has any ideas, I'm game to try them, but for me, Linux 2.2.x
is not stable (I haven't upgraded my home server yet, either).
