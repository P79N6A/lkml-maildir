Hi,
   	I think I found a problem with ACPI and disk-suspend "swsusp" option
        of 2.6.4 kernel. 
        In a few words: when resuming the "ac adapter status" would not
        refresh: if I suspend the laptop with the AC adapter on, then on
        resuming ACPI -v will report AC on even if I have plugged out the
        charger. Plugging the charger in and out will resume normal
        behaviour. I discovered it because cpufreqd would not lower the CPU
        clock after the resume... 
        HTH, 
             	Romano
