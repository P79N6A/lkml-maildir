working on drivers for graphics cards for XFree86 a long time now
I know pretty well that usually it's just a nice dream
that anyone out there would take the free sources and fix even
small bugs for hardware _many_ users have and suffer but which 
I don't have for testing and fixing.
don't get me wrong, I really like Open Source (after all I'm working on it;)
but I've seen too often that in reality the argument "users might fix 
broken software/drivers" just don't cut -- users too often just wait for 
someone doing the the next release, whether it's binary or free source...
ObOpenSource:  but yes, from time to time we get just reports including
full source patch to fix known or even unknown bugs -- and I really
very much appreciate those emails ena efforts!

ObBinaryDriver;)  of couse binary-only drivers can be fixed by users too
(and fixes can be reported/distributed) -- I've done that too...
