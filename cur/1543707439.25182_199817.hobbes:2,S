But that's what you _want_. Having a real out-of-band signal that says 
"this stuff is wrong, because it was wrong at some point in the past", and 
not allowing concatenation of blocks of utf-8 bytes would be _bad_.
The thing, concatenating two malformed UTF-8 strings is normal behaviour 
in a variety of circumstances, all basically having to do with lower 
levels now knowing about higer-level concepts.
For example, look at a web-page. Look at how the data comes in: it comes 
as a stream of bytes, with blocking rules that have _nothing_ to do with 
the content (timing, mtu's, extended TCP headers etc etc). That doesn't 
mean that you shouldn't be able to
 - work on the partial results and show them to the user as UTF-8
 - be able to concatenate new stuff as it comes in.
Having an out-of-band signal for "bad" would literally be a bad idea. If 
you get a valid UTF-8 stream as a result of concatenation, you should 
consider that to be the correct behaviour, or you should CHECK BEFOREHAND 
if you think it is illegal.
