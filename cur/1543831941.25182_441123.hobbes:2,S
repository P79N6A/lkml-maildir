In the ax88772_bind() function, there is a spot where we read the
PHYSID1 and validate that it's 0x003b.  If it's not, we bail out and
don't complete the initialization.  As it turns out, with the B1 rev,
they use an external PHY that has a different identifier so this check
is no longer valid.  Simply removing that check, or getting rid of the
"goto out2;" part, the device appears to operate with no issues.
