Is that the PDC20270 chipset?  What motherboard are you using (i.e., I guess
you are using two IDE channels on the motherboard, so what chipset are you
using there)?  What kernel?  Are you using ide-scsi at the same time?  A DVD
player?  If so, how have you connected them?  What is the biggest number of
hard disks you are using?  What size?
I would like to try this out myself.  Thank you---this is the first success
story I have heard!
