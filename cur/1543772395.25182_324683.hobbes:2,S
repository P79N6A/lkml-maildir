Well, things are getting more bizarre, adding sleeps between
module loads cures the problem with missing symbols. I then
run into a problem with device mapper/lvm which seems to be
having problems setting up devices. In this section of
the init script:
umount /sys
echo Mounting root filesystem
mount -o defaults --ro -t ext3 /dev/root /sysroot
mount -t tmpfs --bind /dev /sysroot/dev
echo Switching to new root
switchroot /sysroot
umount /initrd/dev
The correct number of volumes are found, but adding a showlabels
command to the init script fails to display them, it spits out
errors about readdir failures in /dev/Volume00
The umount of /sys fails, the root mount fails and obviously, the
switchroot then fails.
I tried using the same config options as the redhat supplied
kernel without any success, this still has module symbol
problems.
I am baffled, but it looks like it is not a symbol table problem.
