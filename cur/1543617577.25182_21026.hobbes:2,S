I don't know if this is a reference to the issue I reported under the "Writeout in
recent kernels..." thread or not. If not, my apologies for clogging up this new
"discussion".
As reported[0] in the above-mentioned thread, the bdflush tuning parameters
you suggested made no difference in my test case other than slightly adjusting
the temporal relationship between writeout and file transfer. -aa still performs
slightly worse than both 2.4.17 stock and -rmap. 2.4.13-ac7 currently beats
all competitors.
