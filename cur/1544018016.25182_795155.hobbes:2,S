Ah, bugger. Thanks for finding this.

That's VFS level data syncing - there may be other XFS level stuff
that can be dones as well (e.g. cleanup/truncate of unlinked inodes)
that will release space.

Right, so you need to use internal xfs sync functions that don't
have these problems. That is:
	error = xfs_sync_inodes(ip->i_mount, SYNC_DELWRI|SYNC_WAIT);
will do a blocking flush of all the inodes without deadlocks occurring.
Then you can remove the 500ms wait.
Cheers,
Dave.
