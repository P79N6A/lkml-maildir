   All the ioctls are passed to the socket's ioctl methods, even when they're
   utterly generic.  Here's a patch which starts to move the really generic
   ones up to the top level.  As you can see, this eliminates a huge amount
   of code duplication.
Looks fine, I'll apply this and push to Linus.
