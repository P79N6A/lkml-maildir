That should be ok

I didnt want to do this as my next patch, which introduces
hotplug support for dynamic sched domains, also calls 
partition_sched_domains. That code is called with the hotplug lock
already held. (I am still testing that code, it should be out by 
this weekend)
However I will add a comment about the synchronization and yes
currently it is taken care of by the cpuset sem
