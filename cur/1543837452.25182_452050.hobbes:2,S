Fair enough.  But by removing the rcu code to do the dirty work, we ended
up breaking the code completely.  So although the rcu work is not the
right method, it needs to be there until we have a better solution.
This solution is better than what is there right now in -rt8, and that is,
-rt8 is broken without it!
