First off, I think it is a good idea to follow the documentation, which stated:
"va_end
Each invocation of va_start must be matched by a corresponding
invocation of va_end in the same function."
Then if it is not really needed, does it take up extra cycles?
"In practice, with most C compilers, calling |va_end| does nothing
and you do not really need to call it.  This is always true in the GNU C
compiler."[1]
Portability:
"But you might as well call |va_end| just in case your
program is someday compiled with a peculiar compiler."[2]
This argument is not as likely thou, but who knows? (Since I guess Intel's
compiler is included in the 'most C compilers')

I think it is a good thing if the code follows the documentation, both 
for the person who tries
to understand the code (to see when the 'args' is no longer needed and 
not getting confused
by the absent of va_end(), after all, IMHO we should write the code how 
we want things to
work and let the compiler do the optimizations (it usually does a better 
job at it then we do))
and to automated searches (that is how I found this one).

Not sure what you mean.
