would it be easier/more robust to first did the unification patches and 
then get the bugfixes and new features in? That would give us your 
bugfixes and new features on both 32-bit and 64-bit at the same time.
feel free to do whichever approach you prefer - but it would be nice to 
preserve the unification and cleanup work done by Harvey.
btw., is any of your bugfixes 2.6.24 material?
