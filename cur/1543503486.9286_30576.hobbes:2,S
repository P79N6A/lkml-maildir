Subject: 2.3.10 performance question...

I had heard that 2.3.x had some nice filesystem improvements, so I decided
to run some performance tests. I know this is far from a stable release,
but I was curious as to what I found...
My system:
Dual PPro-200
128mb memory
Kernel/distribution on an IDE drive (that was basically unused during this
test)
IBM 9gb SCSI drive on an Adaptec 2940 (this was the drive that was tested)
Ether Express Pro 100
I ran a simulation test of Internet traffic to a caching proxy server. The
test stressed disk activity (more writes than reads), network traffic
(about 20mb/s sustained), and to some extent CPU (about 20% utilization)
Running 200k requests (admittedly not a lot) with 100 concurrent
connections.
The 2.2.9 kernel (I've yet to try 2.2.10) was about 75% faster than the
2.3.10 kernel. This was pretty much exactly opposite of what I expected.
Can anyone shed some light on this? Is it something as simple as turning
off some compile time options in the 2.3.x kernel series that hamper
performance?
