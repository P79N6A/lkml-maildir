Good point, not just for -that- sort of division, but perhaps for
any sort.
I am skeptical that there is much value to be added to the current
hodge podge of documents in the Documentation directory by rearranging
them in some grand scheme.
Certainly there is some value that can be subtracted -- just changing
it will result in some minor cost to each of us, adjusting to the
changes.  The greater the changes, the more aggressive the effort to
categorize it, the greater this distributed cost of change.
Perhaps what we have is deeper than just improperly arranged Docs.
The content of the Docs may have too much variation in depth, topic,
breadth, organization, style and such to be well suited to a deep
structure.
Maybe it looks disorganized because it is -- more than just skin deep.
