I don't like things to happen for magic bits conditions. EPOLL_CTL_ADD
requires the same code internally and is more clear for the user. If
someone won't shoot me before, I think the final interface will be :
#include <bits/poll.h>
#define EPOLLIN POLLIN
...
#define EPOLL_CTL_ADD 1
#define EPOLL_CTL_DEL 2
#define EPOLL_CTL_MOD 3
struct epoll_fd {
	int fd;
	unsigned short events;
	unsigned short revents;
	__uint64_t obj;
};
int epoll_create(int size);
int epoll_ctl(int epfd, int op, struct epollfd *pfd);
int epoll_wait(int epfd, struct epollfd *events, int maxevents, int timeout);
Ulrich, is it right for you or do you want EPOLL* bits to be directly
defined as numbers instead of assuming the POLL* vaules ?
At the very end the opaque object might help in many cases while it won't
hurt other cases.

It'll be possible to add epfd1 inside epfd2, not epfd1 inside epfd1.

Uhm !? It'll refer to files opened on the other process. To handle this
correctly we should prevent an epoll file to be passed with SCM_RIGHTS in
net/core/scm.c. I mean, no catastrophic things should happen, only the
interface won't work correctly. I don't know if the extra handling code is
worth, but we should definitely put this inside epoll(2).

Yes, obviously.
