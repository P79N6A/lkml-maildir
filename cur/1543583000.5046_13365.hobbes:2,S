i thought that it was my network driver (xircom), but
i recompiled 2.4.2 without sound support and apm
--suspend has begun to work again.
the sound card is a yamaha YMF-744B.  i hadn't been
compiling with sound support (i dont care about sound
on my laptop), but when i got 2.4.2 i decided to try,
and now i'm pretty sure that was the problem.
is there anything else i should do, or information i
could provide that would confirm this analysis or help
to find a fix?
