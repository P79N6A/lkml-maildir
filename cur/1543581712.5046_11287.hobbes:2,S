I've had some problems with this card, as Aristeu Rozanski have asked you
(Jeff) for some news about driver development...
we have some machines that did some random reboot or card lockups:
- rtl8139.c, card lockup
- (2.2.17) 8139too.c, machine reboot
- (2.2.18) 8139too.c (0.9.12-2.2 - PIO mode), machine reboot
we are testing new version with MMIO mode to find out what is wrong
(until now, it seems to be stable)
If you want, I could get more info or testing something else, ok ?
