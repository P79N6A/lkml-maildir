You have to increase the other processes allocations, putting them
over their limits. If you then force them into reclaim, they're going
to stall, and give bad latency.

See "inefficent" above (sorry ;-)) What you've chosen is more correct,
but much higher overhead. The point was that there's tradeoffs either
way - the conclusion we came to last time was that to make it 100%
correct, you'd be better off going with a model like Xen.
1. You're adding a backpointer to struct page.
2. Each page is not accounted to one container, but shared across them,
so the billing changes every time someone forks or exits. And not just
for that container, but all of them. Think pte chain based rmap ...
except worse.
3. When a container needs to "shrink" when somebody else exits, how do
we do reclaim pages from a specific container?
