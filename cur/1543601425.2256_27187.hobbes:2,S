	You can also try to stop the ARP for your asymmetric route
using the per-route ARP flag (patch for 2.4 only):
http://www.linux-vs.org/~julian/
go to "Solution 2: Per-route ARP flag"
May be you need to add ip rule before reaching table main, i.e.
to use such commands:
ip rule add prio 100 to shaped_network/24 iif eth0 table 100
ip route add shaped_network/24 dev shaper0 table 100 noarp
I assume (if I understand your setup correctly) this command will
drop the ARP probes coming through eth0 and asking for non-local IP
addresses on shaped networks on shaper device(s). You can put all
your networks reachable through shaper devices in table 100. All
other networks on non-shaper devices will be reported from the
proxy_arp.
	I don't know whether this will work but you can try. At
least, I don't see a way the other device flags related to ARP
to work for you: hidden (only in 2.2), arp_filter and rp_filter.
