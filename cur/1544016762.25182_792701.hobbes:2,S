I meant the ratio of prices here.

I compare the prices from time to time (about once a year I think) and
the difference has been usually much higher than 20 times if my memory
serves me right.  Intel SSDs are on pretty expensive side, even 1/3 of
that price means > 20 times price difference per byte.  If you compare
that price with main memory, it's only ~3.5 times cheaper.

I'd love that too.  For areas where data size doesn't grow
exponentially, it is and will continue to be great and be getting even
better, but I'm just not sure whether it will rise as the mainstream
secondary storage in foreseeable future given the price discrepancy
but I'll be happy to be taken by surprise.  :-)
Thanks.
