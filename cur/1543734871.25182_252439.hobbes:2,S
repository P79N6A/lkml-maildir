Start with the smallest logical change(s), possibly just extracting them
from the big diff with vi.  Assuming you have a decent diff format (-up
is what I find the most useful) you should just be able to copy the
original patch, delete all the hunks that are unrelated, and you are left
with logical change.
Now that you have it as a separate patch, apply it to the reference tree
and rediff to get a reduced-size combined patch.  For some changes that
stomp on overlapping lines of code you don't have much hope but to recreate
them by hand, but hopefully those are in relatively few areas.
Consider using a source-control tool next time ;-/.  
Cheers, Andreas
