Yup, apparently I was missing your point (banging on head once more).
Thanks for spotting this!
Ingo - what's the state of tip/cpus4096?  Shall I push this as an
append patch, or redo the original so bisectability works.
Also, Yinghai - would you know of a straight forward way to test
the irq migration?   I have taken cpus offline and back online
but wasn't sure if any irq's were being moved off of cpu 0 which
cannot be taken offline.
Thanks,
Mike
