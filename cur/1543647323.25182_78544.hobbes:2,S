There are areas where the TAHI tests expect a certain behaviour when
more than one behaviour is acceptable.
As I recall there is an issue around the behaviour of a packet being
received with a zero length payload.  The TAHI tests seem to expect
one type of ICMPv6 response,  whereas depending upon the value of
next header and the order in which header field validations occur,
two different types of ICMP error can be generated.
Specifically parameter problem identifying the payload field or the
next header field.  I seem to remember this being triggered when a
jumbo header is received by a node that doesn't understand jumbograms.
