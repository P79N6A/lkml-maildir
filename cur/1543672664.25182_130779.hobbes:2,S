Here we have 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0.
We need to understand why there is such variation.  If we can do that,
then perhaps we can make those 1.0's and 1.5's go away.
Is that a thing you can work on?  One approach would be to vary parameters
(filesystem type, amount of memory, TCQ lengths, workload, whatever) and
see which ones the throughput is sensitive to.
