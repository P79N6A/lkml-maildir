I have a fairly new (one month old) server at a clients that locks up
after being up anywhere for 15 minutes to 3 days. It is running an
updated (non 2.2) Redhat 5.1 distribution. Specifics are as follows:
Hardware:
Intel N400BX Motherboard (Built in SCSI (UW/U) & ethernet)
Intel Astor Chasis with RAID Cage
Dual Intel 350 MHz CPUs
256 MB ECC SDRAM (No ECC errors in log)
Comtrol RocketPort/PCI Quad Cable Serial Card
AMI MegaRAID (w/16 MB RAM) 428 card (using driver from web site, not
2.2.X driver)
Qty 3 9.1 GB Seagate Medalist Drives in RAID 5 Array (Hardware Style,
not MD) - on MegaRAID
BestPower Fortress UPS
Sony DD3 Tape Drive - on Integrated Symbios Logic SCSI card
SCSI CDROM - on Integrated Symbios Logic SCSI card
Software:
Linux Kernel v2.0.36 (patched with AMI's drivers)
Comtrol's Rocket Port driver (from web site)
Best's UPS deamon
Samba (latest 2.0.3 i believe) -it's been slightly modified (lock
timeout down to 10 ms from 100 ms and compiled with -O3 -m486)
ip forwarding is turned on for use with ppp0 that crond brings up in the
morning and closes in the evening
IP masq. is setup so all the pcs can surf
The kernel was built with SMP support, all necessary (SCSI, RAID,
IPFW/MASQ Stuff) drivers built in (not modules). Comtrol card driver is
a module.
What Happens:
The machine hangs...several times now...one oops only so far (and the
user rebooted on me). The one oops I got was the following:
FORWARDED INTERRUPT TIMEOUT (AKP = 1, Saved AKP = 0)
All other lockups have been complete crashes, nothing to the screen,
nothing in the logs...
If anyone needs any more info I will get it for them...ANY help will be
GREATLY appreciated....
