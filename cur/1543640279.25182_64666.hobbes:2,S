I actually don't mind compiling and trying lots of different kernels.  
It's a fast machine; I could set it up to compile a lot of kernels 
overnight, and in the morning it would just take a few minutes per kernel 
to install, reboot, and see if the problem is still there.

That would be really helpful.  This problem seems to occur for me with 
all CD-Rs burnt under Windows using Adaptec DirectCD.
I would also be happy to apply kernel patches and retest.  Is there 
anyone familiar with the ATAPI code in the kernel who could provide some 
guidance?
