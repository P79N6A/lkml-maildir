Well, mod is inside module->module_core, so that makes sense: check
the section layout, but usually the .text section is first, then mod
will be near the .data section (turn on debugging in layout_sections
to get the details).

Something is badly wrong: look in include/linux/module.h and you'll
see the initialization of __this_module (which becomes mod).  By
leaving the .percpu member uninitialized, it will be initialized to
NULL.
Random guess: did the build system not rebuild your modules properly
when module.h changed?
Puzzled,
Rusty.
