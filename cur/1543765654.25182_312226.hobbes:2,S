I usually never complain, or give negative motivation, but this is a 
reality.

If it wouldn't be because my wifi card only works in 2.6 and cause the 
speedstep support for my laptop, I would be using 2.4 kernels.

I have returned laptops to get them exchanged for one's that have a 
e100/e1000 instead the tigon3. It's a shame that manufacturers still use 
this chip on servers and laptops.
