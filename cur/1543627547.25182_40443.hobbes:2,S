I'd suggest against making this kind of complicated inlien functions, and
I also don't see why the for_each_zone() isn't a simpler doubly nested
for-loop instead of being forced into a less obvious iterative loop?
In short, this looks syntactically simple, but the syntactic simplicity 
comes at the expense of a unnecessarily complex implementation.
