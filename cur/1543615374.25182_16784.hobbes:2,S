After thinking about this a bit more, why wouldn't this be the fix?  The
problem is that gcc is assuming that this is a 'normal' program (or in
this case, part of a program) and that it, and that the standard rules
apply, so it optimizes the strcpy into a memcpy.  But in this small bit
of the kernel, it's not.  It's not even using the 'standard library
functions', but what the kernel provides.  This problem can only crop up
in the time before we finish moving ourself around.
