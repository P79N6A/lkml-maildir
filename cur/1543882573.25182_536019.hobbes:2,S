Different mmu.  The desktop 32bit mmu Linus refered to has almost nothing
in common with the mmu on 64bit systems.

Real highend HBAs don't have that problem.  But for example aacraid
which is very common on mid-end servers is a _lot_ faster when it
gets continous memory.  Some benchmark was 10 or more percent faster
