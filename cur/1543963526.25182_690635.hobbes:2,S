We can move stuff to drivers/of and include/linux, but we should only
move the parts that are truly architecture-independent.  We should not
have anything like #ifdef CONFIG_PPC_PSERIES in the files in those
directories.  If it needs an ifdef like that, then that part of the
file should stay under arch/powerpc.
In other words, it's OK to split files and end up with more files than
we have at present.  That's better than adding ifdefs.
Paul.
