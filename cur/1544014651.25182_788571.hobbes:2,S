There's another issue: you also need to lock the thing that gives you the 
task pointer in the first place. So it's not sufficient to do 
get_task_struct(), you also need to do it within a context where you know 
that the pointer is not going away _while_ you do it.
And with the mutexes clearing the ->owner field without even holding the 
spinlock, that is not a guarantee we can easily get any way. Maybe we'd 
need to hold the tasklist_lock or something.
