I'd suggest :
   (c) release before holidays, and not extend merge window. That way,
       users can test it during holidays, and we possibly merge less
       things this time, leading to less changes and more focus on fixes
       in 2.6.29, which I admit may imply more crap in 2.6.30. But that
       could give a high quality 2.6.29 by spring.
Just my 2 cents,
Willy
