The first thing to check is whether memory is really exhausted at the
time the errors are logged (cat /proc/meminfo).  Then you want to see
which paths in __alloc_pages could possibly allow this PF_MEMALLOC +
GFP_WAIT allocation request to drop all the way through without being
serviced.  Sorry, I haven't had time to do that and won't for a few
days.  Even if you triggered it, it is probably a hole in the scan
logic.  We have __GFP_WAIT, so it should wait.
Here's a hint, look very critically at this part of page_alloc.c:
455    /*
456     * Fail in case no progress was made and the
457     * allocation may not be able to block on IO.
458     */
459    return NULL;
