Subject: PROBLEM: snd-usb-audio (I think) hangs apps ( audacious media player )  in 'D' state, linux = 2.6.18.3

lkml,
I use a soundblaster audigy 2 NX external sound card in USB 2.0 high
speed mode. 
Until 2.6.18 pausing the player would instantly 'D' state
audacious, requiring a re-boot. I thought it went away in 2.6.18 but
it recently hung again when the system was under heavy load. This
most recent hang occured while playing for the first
time, and produced a 'Zl' state in audacious instead of a D state.

Attempting to cat /proc/asound/NX/audigy2nx also produced a hung
process.

attachments:
* kernel config is attached as: kernel-config-2.6.18.3
* audacious in 'D' state /proc<pid> dump: audacious-crashed-proc-dump
On a previous hang of audacious I was able to capture information from /proc/<pid> while audacious was hung in a 'D' state.
I had difficulty copying or tar'ing the /proc/<pid> directory even with the paths restricted to plain files. As a work-around
I whipped up a perl script that would dump the /proc/<pid> paths to a single file, listing the path , followed by the contents.
This file is larg'ish and probably pretty ugly, but I have attached it in hope that it may assist in tracking down the problem. 
* strace of the cat process that hung: hung-cat-in-proc-asound-NX-audigy2nx
my apologies to cat owners. I was unable to ptrace attach to the zombied audacious or a cat
process, so I ran a strace. 
A friend has suggested compiling with ingo's lock debugging which I will do. I don't mind recompiling so
any suggestions for how to capture more information from the kernel would be appreciated. I will probably
look into kexec crash dump tonight.
Let me know if this report can be improved , or re-directed. Any help appreciated. Thanks.
