That last MTRR is created by the vesafb. It doesn't size video memory,
but instead creates an MTRR big enough to cover xresolution * yresolution * depth
and then rounds down to the nearest alignment that is allowed for MTRRs.
(in your case 1MB).

X sized the video memory, and has a better idea of what is going on.
In an ideal world, X could fix up suboptimal MTRR setups like this
by deleting the existing range.
Another way of working around it is to tell the vesafb not to set up an
mtrr at all. There is a boot command line option to tell it to do this iirc.

X should also do the right thing without the second command.
With MTRR 7 disabled, there will be a free MTRR available for X
to use.
