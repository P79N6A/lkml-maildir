for 2.6.18 there is a patch which makes AHCI sata behave correctly on
suspend/resume. it was originally written by Forrest Zhao and is now
included in the 2.6.19-rcX tree
you can apply the libata patch that went into 2.6.18-mm1. it is to be found
in the broken-out dir of 2.6.18-mm1 and named
git-libata-all-2.6.18-mm1.patch
when applying it to 2.6.18.1 you will get three rejects because the patches
are already in 2.6.18.1. simply say 'n' -> 'n' on those three.
