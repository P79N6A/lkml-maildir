Yes and no - it *is* unpacked, but currently we have no code that would
try to run something from initramfs.  If you want to play with that -
add something like run_init_process("/init"); right before the call of
prepare_namespace() in init/main.c (and be ready to have /init on
initramfs do the rest, obvoiusly).
