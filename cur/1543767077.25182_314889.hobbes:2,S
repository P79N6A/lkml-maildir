You have made semaphores bigger and slower on the architectures that
have load-linked/store-conditional instructions, which is at least
ppc, ppc64, sparc64 and alpha.  Did you take the trouble to understand
the ppc semaphore implementation?
What changes do you want to make to the semaphore functionality?
Paul.
