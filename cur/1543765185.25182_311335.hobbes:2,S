Your end users do not benefit from drivers that are not well
integrated with the kernel. If a user has to jump through hoops to
make their hardware work (including downloading extra drivers, etc.),
that is not a benefit. Case in point: the patch in question _came from
an end user_.
We've now got 12 years experience in the headaches of out of tree
drivers (binary or not) as users, developers, and distributors, and
we're sick of it. We're not supporting that approach any more, they
don't exist as far as we're concerned until they're candidates for
merger. Your hardware is no exception.

End users do not benefit from bad interfaces. This may seem in
conflict with the above, but it's not. One of the main benefits of
kernel integration is that the trouble spots get sorted out and the
interfaces get cleaned up. This is good for everyone. Feel free to
resubmit those features when they're done right.
This is what your customers want, whether they know it yet or not.
Anything else is a stopgap.

And the rest of us make a note to not get Digi hardware because we're
sick of these out of tree drivers and the unspeakable hacks they
generally contain in the name of special features.
