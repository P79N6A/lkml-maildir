Surely this introduces integrity problems when `force` is not set?
Security holes? Perhaps not, but I wouldn't guarantee it.
However: I like your idea. And getting rid of the lookup_write logic is
a good thing.
I don't much like that it changes the semantics of follow_page for
write on a readonly pte, and that is where your problem is introduced.
I think to go down this route you'd at least need a follow_page check
that is distinct from 'write'. 'writeable', maybe.
Then, having a 'writeable' flag lets you neatly "comment" your idea of
what might constitute a writeable pte, as opposed to the current code
which basically looks like black magic to a reader, and gives no indication
of how it satisfies the get_user_pages requirements.
A minor issue: I don't much like the proliferation of __follow_page flags
either. Why not make __follow_page take a bitmask, and be used directly by
get_user_pages, which would also allow removal of the 'write' argument from
follow_page.
I would cook you some patches, but I'm not in front of the source tree.
