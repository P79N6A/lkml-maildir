Good morning, John,
	(My apologies for floating offtopic for kernel programming.  I 
wanted to provide a quick example for John and others interested in doing 
this so they could see this can be done outside of the kernel.)

	Is there any reason this couldn't be done in userspace by using 
named pipes instead of a new form of symlink?
#!/bin/bash
if [ ! -e livepipe ]; then
	echo Making livepipe >&2
	mkfifo livepipe
fi
while : ; do
	echo -n . >&2
	( date ) >livepipe
	sleep 1
done
	Run this, and then from another window, simply do:
cat livepipe
	To see the date, or whatever output is provided by the subshell.
	I'd like to sincerely request that further discussion _not_ 
continue on linux-kernel - please respond privately.
 	Cheers,
	- Bill
