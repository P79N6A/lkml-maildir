Full ACK. What currently bugs me is that there are code places which 
"violate" your suggestion in a different way, i.e.
 void *foo = null_or_not_null_that_is_the_question();
 ...
 if(foo)
      do_bar();
vs
 if(foo == NULL)

Unlikely that it will be better, as the compiler knows that bar() returns 
bool, testing it against TRUE or FALSE does not make a difference to
using "bar()" or "!bar()" respectively.
But I agree. The "!" operator was invented *for a reason*, so we do not 
need ==false.

In that case you cannot work with bools at all, because they are not 
guaranteed to be big enough for status codes. Here, 'int' comes into play.
And then func_return_int()==TRUE/FALSE seems strange anyhow. That's like

On x86, it is not. But x86_64 has int=4 bytes and long=8 bytes.
What's wasted is probably the cacheline due to a longer immediate 
integer in the instruction. SPARC64 for example is even more sensitive:
also has int=4 and long=8, but generates a lot more instructions for 'long' 
data shuffling than for 'int', because it has a small instruction size.
And also start to think of 'long long' (resp. int64_t) used somewhere [in 
code] on x86 -- also needs extra ops because the regs are not wide enough.
