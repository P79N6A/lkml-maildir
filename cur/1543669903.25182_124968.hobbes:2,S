yep, and here is the problem ^^^^^^^^. Your patch seems ok but is horribly 
slow. I've tried it first the day you submitted the patch. It's even alot 
slower than w/o Preempt or CONFIG_PREEMPT to no.
My Celeron 1,3GHz with 512 MB RAM felt like good old 486SX/25 while doing,
for example, a kernel compilation :(
ciao, Marc
