Anyone out there know how to get on the reiserFS devel mailing
list?  I was on the namesys pages, but they have wonderful
microsoft code on them or java or something so that you can't
actually _use_ their mailing list subscription thing if you don't
run java or whatever.  Certainly doesn't work for me in Netscape
or Lynx anyways.. and I'm _not_ turning Java on for anything
period.  It is a big huge gaping security hole best left off...
Anyways... I just want to get on the reiserfs mailing list and
can't find any info available to non-java browsers.
What I'd like is:

No java web forms please...
TIA
