When people advance *Windows* as a *consistent* UI, something is *badly*  
wrong.
Yes, it's more consistant than X, but that's about the limit.
If you want consistent UI, look at modern MacOS versions, for example.  
(Incidentally, they also have the "treat structured files as directories"  
thing. In purely user-level code. For a strictly selected set of  
structured files and contents thereof.)
