- Again, to preserve Unix semantics (if a process with {r,s}uid=0 and
euid!=0 does an exec(), the resulting process also has euid!=0, that
is, no effective capabilities).

What does "currently" mean"?  On an unpatched Linux, I believe (and
observe) the following:
* if your /bin/sh is bash, it purposely drops privileges (by doing
something like setresuid(getuid(),getuid(),getuid()), I haven't
checked the source), and this is the reason you get "Permission
denied",
* if your /bin/sh is something else, it keeps euid==0 and you have
root privileges all the way, including in children processes - this is
traditional Unix behavior.
My patch doesn't change any of this (I've checked), since it uses
inheritance rules for capabilities which are closely modeled upon
those of {r,s,e}uid (in fact, that's my very reason for "changing"
things), and since the bash method of dropping privileges is also kept
woring.
(I don't know *why* bash tries to drop privileges.  It's probably an
attempt at avoiding certain security problems, but I think it's a
rather bad one.)

My patch doesn't change this behavior.  Evidently, if it did, it would
be very bad...

In the current (unpatched) Linux kernel, the inheritable set is
completely ignored anyway. :-( So certainly any attempt to make
something of it must change the behavior.
I agree that the above code snippet exhibits a difference of my patch
w.r.t. the capabilities(7)-documented behavior (or at least, might,
according to the way suid programs are interpreted), but this
difference is
(a) necessary in order not to break traditional Unix semantics
(children of a program with euid==0 also have euid==0, and the father
process can't avoid that), and
(b) necessary for security reasons (it is imperative that the parent
of a suid root process cannot prevent that process from keeping
privileges, otherwise we get the sendmail bug again).
To summarize my answer: as far as I know, my patch does not change
suid behavior: I've taken great care not to let that happen.  It does
change the documented inheritance behavior of capabilities, but that
is unavoidable.
PS: I should be releasing a new version of my patch, along with a
merged version of yours, very shortly.
