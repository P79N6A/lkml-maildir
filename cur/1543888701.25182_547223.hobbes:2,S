Hmmmm.. Yes I am thinking about that one too. Right now I have a system
that triggers reclaim every 10 seconds or after more than 100 objects have 
been reclaimed.

Well, this one only allows manual triggering. To my embarasasment I found 
that the kmem_cache_shrink calls for icache and dentries are only in 2.4. 
They have been removed in 2.6.X. I need to add them back to 2.6.

Well flags need to be passed and those flags are obtained via disabling 
interrupts.

Hmmmm... Okay but this is a rare situation in SLUB. Regular slab 
operations always run with interrupts disabled.

Ahh. Thanks. Will fix that.

Right. Done.
