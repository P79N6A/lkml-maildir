WE ARE NOT GOING TO A EVENT DEAMON!
Centralized event deamons are crap, unmaintainable, and unreadable. 
They are a maintenance nightmare, both from a development standpoint and
from a MIS standpoint.  They encourage doing everything in one program,
keeping state in private memory, depending on ordering, and just
generally do bad things. 
/sbin/hotplug, on the other hand, makes events clearly independent
things, and encourages writing simple scripts that can be combined and
localized. In other words, it's the UNIX way.
I've seen the madness of event deamons, and it's called "cardmgr" and
"acpid". We don't want it.
