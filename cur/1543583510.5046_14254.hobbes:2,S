Yes, this fixed the oops. Now it's possible to ctrl-alt-del reboot
when i2o_block hangs. It still happens four times out of five reboots
meaning it is intermittent. (Timing as Alan mentioned - goes away when
DEBUG enabled) I have to put in some better HD's and test stability 
of the filesystem on this device. Any suggestions what's best way to
do it to get some meaningful results?
Thanks David
