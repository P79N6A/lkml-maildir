I just put the archive I've gathered so far in a Git tree on kernel.org:
    git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/nico/archive.git
It is also available through gitweb from:
    
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/nico/archive.git
It currently stops at Linux v1.0. I would like to continue populating 
this archive up to the current "Linux kernel history" Git repository 
from Thomas Gleixner which currently doesn't go further back than 
v2.4.0.  This is however extremely time consuming to track down old 
mailing list and newsgroup archives in order to find announcements to 
serve as commit log material.  Therefore I'd be really glad if people 
could help me find those and send me copies of relevant announcements.  
The content of the current archive should give a good idea of what I'm 
looking for.
Also, the following items are currently missing and apparently vanished 
from the surface of the planet:
 - v0.02 sources
 - v0.03 sources and announcement
 - v0.10 announcement
 - v0.96 sources
 - sources for v0.99.13{abcdefghij} (got k, don't know where the serie
   ends) as well as announcements for all of them
 - all announcements for v0.99.14{a-z} except for pl14r
 - announcements for pl15c to pl15j, 1.0-pre1, and ALPHA-1.0.
If you happen to have any of those please drop me a note.
Otherwise the archive appears fairly complete with almost 3 years of 
Linux development history captured in a 3MB pack file.
