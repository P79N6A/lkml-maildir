Thanks. I'll stick one on and see what happens.

There are two server types:
1. Cyrix 686/MX 333Mhz
   Intel EtherexpressPro 10/100
   Motherboard: AT Socket 7  TxPro chipset
   1 Fujitsu MPB3064ATU hard disk
   1 Maxtor 91080D5 hard disk
2. Intel Pentium II 400Mhz
   ATX Gigabyte SMP Motherboard Intel 440BX AGP chipset
   Intel EtherexpressPro 10/100
   3 IBM 14Gb hard discs
There are nine servers in total, the system disks are built from a
single `build disk'. So the software is indentical. The servers
run virtual servers (anything upto 60 of them). Each virtual server
runs Apache 1.3.6, crond, syslogd and atd. There is no NFS support.
There is IP firewall support for the purposes of IP accounting only.
The SMP motherboards contain only 1 processor. No servers run X.
The box that crashed this morning was server type 2, running
kernel 2.2.10 but is not compiled for SMP support. Most have crashed,
with the same symptons, within the last 8 days (some built with an
SMP enabled kernel, some not). One server (of type 2) with a 2.2.10 SMP
kernel has been up 80 days.
The kernel's built with egcs 1.1.2. BIOS APM is turned off, but APM is
turned on in the kernel for CPU idle calls. However this problem has
been seen without APM support in the kernel. USB support is turned
off.
There is one oddity that occurs on all servers and that is to do with
syslogd. The servers run 60 virtual servers. Each virtual server runs
Apache 1.3.6, crond, atd and syslogd. However, syslogd tends to die
quite regularly. It blocks on a `select' syscall for most of the time (as
expected) but then receives a SIGTERM and dies.
To temporarily get around this problem, I masked out the SIGTERM signal
and syslogd now runs 99% of the time fine. However, it does still die
(without any errors) and occasionally `crond' also dies.
Regards,
Nick.
