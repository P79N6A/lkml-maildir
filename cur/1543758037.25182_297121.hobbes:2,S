Absolutely. However it's an old server that used to work with
2.4.22 and before. I don't want to have to rewrite everything
and.... Why should send() recv() read() write(), etc. always
get an EINTR everytime something uses them?  It doesn't happen
on other systems.
I think that something is supposed to be masked OFF that
isn't being masked OFF
