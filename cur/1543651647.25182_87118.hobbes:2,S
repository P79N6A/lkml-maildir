No! You will break many machines. You cannot use out_p() when
writing the latch it __must__ be out(). the "_p" puts a write
to another port between the two writes. That will screw up
the internal state-machine of most PITs including AMD-SC520.
Again, any time you must make two consecutive writes to the
same device port to set it, you must not use the "_p" version.
The above latch setting must be:
	outb(LATCH & 0xff, 0x40);
	outb(LATCH >> 8,   0x40);
Of course, the second write could have a "_p" option, but
you won't need it.
Cheers,
