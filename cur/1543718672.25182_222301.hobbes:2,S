I also do some tests with ethereal up, and the log contains a lot of
retransmission and duplicate acknoledgment packets.
I add to this mail :
- netperf.out.bz2 -> the ascii readable log (compressed with bzip2)
- netpert.dump.bz2 -> the log (format pcap, also compressed with bzip2)
Hope it can help...
