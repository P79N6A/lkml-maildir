I think I can explain whats going on. The commit you pointed to isn't
really at fault, it just happens to trigger an extra framebuffer
blanking call and this exposes a bug in the ibm backlight code which
there is already a fix for.
Basically, console blanking triggers a backlight_update_status() call
and bd->props.brightness wasn't set correctly at boot time. If
bd->props.brightness is set correctly, that call won't cause a problem. 
Jiri: I've appended a patch that should already be queued, could you
test and see if it solves the problem.

The ibm backlight driver should really try and work with the system a
little more. Even if it can't turn the display off, the power attribute
should  minimise power usage as best it can. If that means just dimming
the display, so be it. Ideally, I'd still prefer for it to gain support
for turning the display off.
In the update_status function, there are three sources of information
you need to combine:
bd->props.brightness
bd->props.power
bd->props.fb_blank
Since the backlight class doesn't know the capabilities of the hardware,
it is left to each implementation to combine these options in a way that
makes sense. Currently ibm just looks at the first one but it could dim
if the latter two are anything other than FB_BLANK_UNBLANK. See corgi_bl
as an example (which also looks at its own variables too).

ACPI: ibm-acpi: fix initial status of backlight device
The brightness class core does not update the initial status of the
device's brightness at register time.  Do it by ourselves.
