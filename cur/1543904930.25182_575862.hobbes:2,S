Has anybody else hit an actual problem with this, or is the borkage restricted
to this one driver?  And, quite frankly, given that *before*, the driver would
try and reject 5 different unused IRQs and then complain when it found one in
use, I'm not totally convinced that the driver wasn't on crack *before*.  The
only thing I've been able to prove to myself is that it's acting differently,
but I'm pretty sure that *both* before and after are broken, just in different
ways.
I'd not fault Fernando's patch here - if I'd enabled the DEBUG_SHIRQ on
previous kernels, I'd have spotted it then.  I never enabled it because I
didn't know I had drivers that might have bugs in that area.
Kylene or somebody else who actually understands the TPM chipsets would have
to provide guidance on how it's *supposed* to work, and I'm certainly willing
to testbed patches.
For what it's worth - I actually read the source some more, discovered the
module parm 'interrupts=0' (which forces polling mode), and managed to get
things at least semi-working with the libtpm-2.0 test suite:

Unsure why it reports TPM 1.1 here, and 1.2 when the driver initializes.
But at least I've gotten the chip to do a "Hello World!", so that's progress. :)
