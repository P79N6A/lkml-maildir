Right. But that's a long term goal ;)

I discover everything at boot time via Open Firmware, though on
ppc32, embedded platforms have gazillion different ways of getting
to them.

Yes. Well, I suppose having a 8250_ppc{64}.c where I do the discovery
a bit like it's done with ACPI would be ok for everything but serial
console... I can do an OF plaform device that gets probed a bit late
though, and that wouldn't help for embedded stuffs, but then, those
people can always still use the hard coded table for a while ... :)
That would mean though having the kernel serial console for early boot
be separate from the 8250 driver... like you proposed. That would work
too... I have to ponder this approach, indeed probably better than
my patch provided you get your early uart stuff upstream :)
Ben.
