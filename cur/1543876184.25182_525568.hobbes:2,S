Well, in this case (since it's at bootup only), I'd agree with panic(), 
but generally I disagree - it's actually much better to have a broken 
system limping along and allowing things like syslogd to write the problem 
to log-files and generally working as well as possible.
If people can do a "dmesg" and send it out as an email, we're much more 
likely to get good bug-reports.
But for early boot, and for something that can't really happen anyway, 
panic() sounds fine.
