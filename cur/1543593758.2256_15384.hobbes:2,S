No, the problem goes away if I do this, although then I hae the performance
problems as before.  I also noticed that even when the call to set_half_duplex
is left in, the switch reports that the link is still in full duplex, 100Mb
mode.  I tried forcing half duplex on the switch but this didn't help.  It
actually looks like half duplex is not really being set correctly.
I plugged in a desktop with an eepro100 based card and forced the duplex to half
with the command line options and the switch properly reported a half-duplex
link had been negotiated, with the xircom card the switch reports full-duplex
with or without the set_half_duplex line, which certainly implies it's not
really working right.
Hope the helps.  I won't be back at the office until Monday so that's the
earliest I'll be able to test again, but I'll be glad to test any combination
that I can.
Later,
Tom
