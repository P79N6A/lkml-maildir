The fact that EXPORT_SYMTAB should be in the Makefile or in the code appears
as a comment in some files.
Here is an example in sb_common.c
...
/* FIXME: *grr* why can't the f**in Makefile do this for me ? */
#define EXPORT_SYMTAB

I think that 'somebody' has to choose how the things have to be done.
