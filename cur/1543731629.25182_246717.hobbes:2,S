My apologies if this question has been raised (and answered) elsewhere.
I tried to keep up with the flamefest/discussion but it wasn't always
possible.
How would you do it for directories without making certain names
illegal? ie taking the above you'd do:
cat dirA/metas/permissions > dirB/metas/permissions
But how does that distinguish an access to the metas for dirA and dirB
from an access to a file called permissions within the metas directories
of dirA and dirB?
I think what Linus is trying to do, as far as naming, is create a
consistant access scheme that works for all types of objects in the
fs without making certain names illegal (and with plugins, those
names are not even a fixed thing I believe).
Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, ofcourse. :)
