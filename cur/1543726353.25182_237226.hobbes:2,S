 As I've written, I'm not against it in principle, e.g. feel free to 
recode it to log something like this:
<3>APIC: error on CPU0: 05(04)
<7>APIC:   01: Send Checksum Error
<7>APIC:   04: Send Accept Error
<7>APIC:  (04: Send Accept Error)
or anything sensible more or less similar.  The example doesn't require
any temporary hold space.
