If you happened to have a copy of systemtap built, you might run this
script instead of inserting static hooks into your kernel.  (The tool
has come some way since the OLS '2005 demo.)
#! stap
probe kernel.function("add_to_page_cache") {
  printf("pid %d added pages (%d)\n", pid(), $mapping->nrpages)
}
probe kernel.function("__remove_from_page_cache") {
  printf("pid %d removed pages (%d)\n", pid(), $page->mapping->nrpages)
}
