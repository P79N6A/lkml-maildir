A simpler and better solution for this is to just remove the
definition of kbd_rate from include/asm-ppc/keyboard.h and remove the
lines which reference pckbd_rate from arch/ppc/kernel/chrp_setup.c and
prep_setup.c.  I have sent Linus a patch to this effect already.

The better fix is to go into drivers/ide/sl82c105.c and change it to
use the code that is currently inside the #ifdef CONFIG_ARCH_NETWINDER
block instead of the code that is in the #else branch of that
conditional.  I have posted that patch to lkml a couple of times and
sent to Linus as well, but he hasn't taken it yet (Alan has).
Alternatively, if you don't use the sl82c105 driver, remove it from
your config.
Paul.
