Improved I2O will make 2.6. The code in 2.5 is way behind 2.4 and
basically doesn't work. It also needs no core changes affecting anything
outside of I2O so its a driver item not a core feature by Oct 31

This should be in 2.4 soon. It will be essential by the time 2.6 is out.
I don't know what Martin's plans are for it, but again its pure driver
code so not a core issue
