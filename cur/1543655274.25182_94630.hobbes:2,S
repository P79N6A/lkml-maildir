Sorry for the vague bug report, but I expected it to be a known
problem, or me not reading the docs properly :-)
It's actually another Linux box running Minicom 1.82, (an old 486
laptop), in 80x24 VT102 mode.  I've just tested Minicom 2.00.0, and
the problem is still apparent.
echo $LINES $COLUMNS; stty size
gives:
24 80
0 0
So there does seem to be a problem :-).
John.
