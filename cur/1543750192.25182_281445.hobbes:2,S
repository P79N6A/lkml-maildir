Subject: [RFC] pid randomness
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

hi everyone,
I don't know if this has been discussed before... but I'd like to ask 
why isn't the pids randomized by default?
I mean, of course it's not required for normal functioning but it'd be 
nice to have a Kconfig option to make it happen.
The (newbie) way I see it, it'd not be hard to do... generate pid, check 
if it's unique, give pid to process. It could bring some minor security 
enhancements while taking a slight performance hit (seek & compare 
algorithm for used pids).
What are the pros and cons of this? What are your oppinions on this subjet?
regards,
pedro venda.
