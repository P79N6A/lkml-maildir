Subject: 2.6.10-rc2-mm2 usb storage still oopses

Just a reminder: it's possible to cause a kernel oops simply inserting and 
removing a usb storage (flash pen); using ub driver doesn't improve the 
situation; noticed in 2.6.9-rc4-mm1 and present in 2.6.10-rc2-mm2.
The same device works just fine with 2.6.8.1 (mdk cooker)
I can provide, as previously done, full log for oopses and other details, just 
let me known. (the behaviour is quite the same as already reported, so I 
don't want to waste bandwidth)
