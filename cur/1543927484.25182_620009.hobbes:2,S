Yes, it is. It's a watchdog device, it's meant to reboot the machine if 
whatever task is poking the watchdog dies.

I would say that running a Windows tool that opens up and reads random 
files, on the /dev directory tree, as root, probably does qualify as 
"stupid". I'd say running pretty much anything through Wine as root is 
not a good idea, a Windows app could hose the system without even 
meaning to through exactly such things.

There is.. it's called "root privileges".
