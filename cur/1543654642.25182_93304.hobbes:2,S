What happens if you try to manually mount the cdrom when there's nothing
in the drive?

Can you reproduce this with some other filesystem type (something which
is less flaky than NTFS)?
How many files are on the NTFS filesystem?

Does this comment also apply to the cdrom case?
What mount options are you using to mount these filesystems?  Are they
the same when you do it manually and using autofs?
What does the "dentry_cache" line say in /proc/slabinfo while you're
running the find on the NTFS filesystem?
Thanks,
