Hi all,
I have just tried a 2.6.20-rc5 kernel (I previously used a 2.6.19 one),
and I have noticed that the IPv6 router advertisement functionality is
broken. The interface is not attributed an IPv6 address anymore, despite
/proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/ra_accept being set to 1 (also true for each
individual interface configuration).
Using tcpdump, I am seeing the router advertisement messages arriving on
the interface, but they seems to be ignored.
Does somebody have also seen this behaviour?
Bye,
Aurelien
