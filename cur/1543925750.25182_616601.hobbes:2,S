Could we get around this with, say, a flag that always treats a CFS
schedulable entity as having a weight equal to the number of runnable
tasks in it? So CPU bandwidth would be shared between groups in
proportion to the number of runnable tasks, which would distribute the
cycles approximately equivalently to them all being separate
schedulable entities.

Agreed, but not in the right way IMO.
