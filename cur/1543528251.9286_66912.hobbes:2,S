Some people may also simply be concerned about the proliferation of
tiny config options. I'd say we already have too many of them, and
adding Jos' /proc/nzombies, Peter's kreaperd, or Werner's alternative
sticky shift keys mode option won't make things better.

Spin lock the process table ;-) Well, most people don't seem to be
very concerned about this aspect, and you can fix most problems in
user space (e.g. you probably won't notice if nzombies is off by one or
two on a very busy system that spawns dozens of processes per second).
