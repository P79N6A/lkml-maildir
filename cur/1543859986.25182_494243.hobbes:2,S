Bingo!
It is dying here:
 static inline int
 ebt_check_entry(struct ebt_entry *e, struct ebt_table_info *newinfo,
    const char *name, unsigned int *cnt, unsigned int valid_hooks,
    struct ebt_cl_stack *cl_s, unsigned int udc_cnt)
 {
        struct ebt_entry_target *t;
        struct ebt_target *target;
        unsigned int i, j, hook = 0, hookmask = 0;
        size_t gap = e->next_offset - e->target_offset; <================
        int ret;
        /* don't mess with the struct ebt_entries */
        if (e->bitmask == 0)
                return 0;
when trying to access e->next_offset, which may or may not exist because
'e' sometimes points to a 'struct ebt_entries', not 'struct ebt_entry'
(note the comment before the 'if'.) This code was recently added.
So this (untested) patch should fix it (I tried to move the computation to
a place where it's efficient.)  If so it's needed for 2.6.16.x, 2.6.18.x,
2.6.19.x and 2.6.20-rc.
ebtables: don't compute gap until we know we have an ebt_entry
We must check the bitmap field to make sure we have an ebt_entry and
not an ebt_entries struct before using fields from ebt_entry.
