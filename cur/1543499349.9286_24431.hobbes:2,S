Of course ! No arguments here. But if changes in egcs trigger some problems
them some way to change sources MUST be provided.
Typical discussion between Linus and egcs folks:
Linus: "Egcs x.y.z miscompiles (does not allow, etc.) the following
consturiction: <construction>".
Egcs-folks: "<construction> is wrong in first place and should not work at
all; it worked with gcc 2.7.2.3 by coincident".
Linus: "No problems, I'm linux kernel guru, not egcs/gcc-guru. What's the
correct replacement for <construction> in egcs x.y.z ?"
Egcs-folks: "<construction> was wrong in first place and there are no
replacement in egcs x.y.z"
Linux: "<construction> WORKED with gcc 2.7.2.3. In DOES NOT work with egcs
x.y.z . What's the replacement ?"
Egcs-folks: "<construction> was wrong in first place and there are no
replacement in egcs x.y.z"
This is UNAPPROPRIATE ! EVEN if construction was wrong and worked (on just
a few millions of computers :-) by coincident it's not excuse to not give
any replacement at all !
P.S. There are sometimes need to replace some constructions with different ones
but it's not a problem: as you rightfully noted it's expected pain. Scenario
described above -- that's why Linus is so angry on egcs folks ... Linus is
willing to change kernel sources to accomodate changes in egcs. He just not
ready to scan egcs sources to find a replacement ... He is linux kernel guru,
not egcs/gcc guru ...
