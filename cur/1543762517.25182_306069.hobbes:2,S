Find is doing a full readdir.  It just looks at the link count
of the directory it is doing the readdir on and if it is the
minimal unix link count of 2 it knows it does not have to stat
directory entries to see if they are directories.
As I recall there is also special handling in find for link count
of 1 to automatically handle filesystems that don't follow the normal
unix conventions so every directory entry must be stated.
