Hi,
I mostly agree with Keith.
kdb and kgdb have similar capabilities. kgdb can be used
to do kdb like assembly level debugging too, though it
needs some knowledge of gdb and kgdb internals.
You can analyze any problems with either of the debuggers.
You'll need to decide which debugger to go for depending
on your requirements.
I've got many queries asking kgdb capabilities.
I guess it's time for a webpage comparing the two
debuggers. People who are new to linux kernel and
have not used any of the debuggers can hardly arrive
at a decision as to which debugger is better suited for
their work.
I always suggest for kgdb over kdb because, IMO source
level debugging makes a programmers life much easier.
UML too is a good kernel debugging tool. It offers
the advantage of source level debugging on a single
machine. IMHO it's more useful for beginners.
