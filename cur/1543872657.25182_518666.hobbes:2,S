Well, people actually do use itimers like "give me a timer every second, 
starting five seconds from now".

.. and this is where itimerspec is even better: once you have absolute 
time, *and* a process that might miss ticks (because it does something 
else), the "absolute time start + interval" thing can avoid drifting 
(which a "relative interval" has a really hard time doing).
So if you want a "timer tick every second, *on* the second" kind of 
interface, you really do want a absolute time starting point, and then a 
fixed interval. Two different times.
