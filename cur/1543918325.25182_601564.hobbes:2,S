From include/asm-sh/cpu-sh4/dma.h
53 /*
54  * The DMA count is defined as the number of bytes to transfer.
55  */
56 static unsigned int ts_shift[] __maybe_unused = {
57         [XMIT_SZ_64BIT]         = 3,
58         [XMIT_SZ_8BIT]          = 0,
59         [XMIT_SZ_16BIT]         = 1,

63 #endif
ie ts_shift returns the number of bytes per transfer, but is then used as
a bit shift:
45 /*
46  * We determine the correct shift size based off of the CHCR transmit size
47  * for the given channel. Since we know that it will take:
48  *
49  *      info->count >> ts_shift[transmit_size]
50  *
51  * iterations to complete the transfer.

53 static inline unsigned int calc_xmit_shift(struct dma_channel *chan)
54 {
55         u32 chcr = ctrl_inl(CHCR[chan->chan]);
56
57         return ts_shift[(chcr & CHCR_TS_MASK)>>CHCR_TS_SHIFT];
58 }

I'm not anywhere where I can fix this at the moment, but i am sure it
could be patched quite trivally.
