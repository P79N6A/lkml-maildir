Doh, take a look at top.c around line 1460:
              for(i = 0; i < nr_cpu; i++) {
                if(fscanf(file, "cpu%*d %d %d %d %d\n",
                          &u_ticks, &n_ticks, &s_ticks, &i_ticks) != 4) {
                  fprintf(stderr, "fscanf failed on /proc/stat for cpu %d\n", i);
It would have been ok (like vmstat) if it didn't expect the \n
after the fourth number ;/
Oh well, time for another procps patch ;)
cheers,
Rik
