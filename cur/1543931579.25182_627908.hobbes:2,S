Well since we told people to move over to sysfs for PCI
accesses, and that's where mmap() is done via too,
it should be no surprise that we run into problems when
people want to set attributes for the mmap() as was done
for the procfs case.
So you have two choices:
1) Balk on the sysfs pci usage, and erase years of effort
   of moving people over to sysfs.  Tell them to go back to
   procfs so we can add the attribute setting via ioctl()
   which is absolutely needed.
2) Relax your restrictions a little bit and allow ioctl()'s
   for limited cases, like this one.
Otherwise, propase a way to specify PCI device mmap attributes
which works within your whole-universe sysfs theory of everything
:-)
