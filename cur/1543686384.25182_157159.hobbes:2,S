I can't follow your logic. This is now supposed to be a stable kernel, but
you want to have a bunch of non-working drivers available to reduce
confidence in it? If I have device X, why do you think I would need a
driver less if it were marked BROKEN? A broken list would be a great
starting point for people who are looking for something to do in 2.6.
If you get a bunch of compiler errors without a clear indication that the
driver is known to have problems, it is more likely to produce a "Linux is
crap" reaction. With the problems Windows is showing this week, I'd like
to show Linux as the reliable alternative, not whatever MS is saying about
hacker code this week.
