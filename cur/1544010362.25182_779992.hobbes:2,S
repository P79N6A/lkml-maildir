Once you "implement" the new solution for all the machines I listed, it's 
going to be just as bad, if not worse, than current perfmon3.

I have a currently working solution in perfmon3.
I need a pretty strong reason to abandon that.

perfmon has been around for years.  It's even been in the kernel (in 
Itanium form) for years.  The perfmon patchset has been posted numerous 
time for reviews to the linux-kernel list.  It's not like perfmon was some 
sort of secret project sprung on the world last-minute.
I know the way the Linux kernel development works.  If some other 
performance monitoring implementation does get merged, I will cope and 
move on.  I'm just trying to help avoid a costly mistake.

No.  Multi-thread too.

No.
I do not use PAPI.  PAPI only supports a small subset of counters.
What is needed is a tool for accessing _all_ performance counters on 
various machines.
What is _not_ needed is pushing PAPI into kernel space.

If you can do raw events, then that's enough.  There's no need to put some 
sort of abstraction level into the kernel.  That way lies madness if 
you've ever looked at any code that tries to do it.
As others have suggested, check out the P4 PMU documentation.
