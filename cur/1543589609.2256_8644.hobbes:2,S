That's easy enough. When we are:
1. almost out of swap and
2. need swap space
Then we will be scanning through memory looking for something to
swap out (otherwise we'd not be in need of swap space, right?).
At this point we can simply free up swap entries while scanning
through memory looking for stuff to swap out.

Rik
