1st. ES1371 reports unknown symbol when compiled as a module and tried
    to  insmod. Seems to work when compiled into the kernel.
2nd. usb-storage, seems not to work with scsi. Mount reports sda1 is not
     a valid block device. The Device attached is a camera and works
     fine in 2.4.X. No errors msg reported, scsi/usb reports right
     storage amount when the camera gets attached to the system,
     /proc/scsi/usb-storage/1 and all usbfs entries look ok. Just can't
     mount sda1.
3rd. Finally how to crash the kernel.  Use less to accidentally take a
     look at /proc/scsi/scsi.  The process will be in uninterruptible
     sleep and can't be killed.  Run a shutdown -r now, the file system
     you were on when you started less can not be umounted and the
     kernel crashes before restarting. SMP (2 X PIII) system. 
 Please cc me if you need more info, since I'm not on this list.
