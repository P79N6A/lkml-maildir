Ah..Thanks for pointing this out. sorry I had checked only i386 and x86_64.

Yes, I agree that pci_dev->sysdata can;t be removed. Even we (IOMMU)
were dependent on this field but somehow this field is being overwritten
to point to pci_bus's->sysdata and hence IOMMU was failing. Earlier
it was overwritten to NULL and hence we were not failing but now it
is overwritten to non-NULL and hence we fail.
My therory is that we don;t need to copy pci_bus's->sysdata to 
pci_dev's->sysdata. Below patch solves my problem.
Any objection to below patch?
