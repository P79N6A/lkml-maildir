I'm using 2.4.19-rc5-ac1 on a dual PIV Xeon with no problems. For the
PIV and certain situations you may get very rare random segfaults with
older trees. 2.2 does not fully support the newer PIV processors

80 decimal = 50 hex.

Current 2.4 and 2.2 there is a huge difference. The i2o code has been
through a major rewriting to clean up the codebase and to handle bugs in
the cards a lot better.

You need 2.4.19-rc for the Supertrak 6000 with 2027x based IDE chips,
the 2026x based one should work fine in 2.4.18. I have no idea about 2.2

2.5 I2O is a work in progress. I've done the core and pci layers but I
have no plans to finish off the block/net/scsi code until the rest of
the kernel is a bit more stable and it is possible to run serious QA
tests
> [Q] Did somebody run the 2.5 kernel on a Xeon box and is it (more) stable ?
Its extremely unstable, the IDE code occasionally eats data, the box
hangs a lot. Thats to be expected 2.5 is a development kernel tree.
Don't run 2.5 on a box where you value your data. Do run 2.5 if you want
to be involved in debugging and the like.
2.5 IDE is beginning to stabilize as is the core, so I'm hoping I'll be
able to finish up the I2O code in a couple of months. ...

So it found both I2O volumes quite happily. However the kernel you built
apparently couldnt find a way to mount /dev/i2o/hda1 - that might just
be because you didnt include the right file system in the kernel
