Don't understand the range setup... The code uses c0000000 as the start
and 20000000 as the size for the rapidio law. So whats the 0 0 for? 
At first I thought address-cells 2 means that the range numbers are
pairs expressing 64-bit numbers, eg start 0 0, size c0000000 20000000
but thats not right...
Sorry if I'm asking stupid questions....
And thanks for the patch, just what I need.
BTW do you have any notes/documentation on the space allocation routines
intended use. I'm trying to work it out but I don't see any actual users
of it yet... I need something like it for my distributed DMA driver,
hence the interest.
Cheers
