Actually, from ppc64's point of view, the problem with the test is
that the whole vma could be *less* than HPAGE_SIZE - we don't test
that the address is aligned before checking is_hugepage_only_range().
We thus can call hugetlb_free_pgd_range() on normal page VMAs - which
we only get away with because the ppc64 hugetlb_free_pgd_range() is
(so far) an alias for the normal free_pgd_range().
Your patch below is insufficient, because there's a second test of
is_hugepage_only_range() further down.  However, instead of tweaking
the tested ranges, I think what we really want to do is check for
is_vm_hugetlb_page() instead.
I was worried before, but now that you point out it's the 'end'
address which really matters, not the ceiling, that might be
sufficient.  Um.. except that hugepages, unlike normal pages these
days don't necessarily clean up all possible pagetable pages on
unmap...  crud.  Still the patch below ought to be an improvement.
