Ever heard of path mtu discovery? For example you essentially blocked out 
most people behind IP tunnels from your site (at least those who do not
do MSS hacks) 
In addition to breaking pmtu disc (which is a real showstopper for many setups),
it also have some negative effects on your servers. For example when your
mail server is for some reason trying to contact an unreachable host to
deliver a mail it'll not notice except after having wasted lots of bandwidth
and resources trying to contact the host again and again, even when the ICMP
clearly tells that it won't work.
