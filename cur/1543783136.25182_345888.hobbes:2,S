 It actually depends on the APIC type, rather than the CPU.  E.g. with 
Pentium systems the width of the ID is either 4 bits or 8 bits, depending 
on whether the integrated or an external 82489DX APIC is used.  This 
should be able to be determined by the APIC version; for v <= 0xf the ID 
is 8-bit and for v >= 0x10 it used to be 4-bit.  Now you only need to 
determine what is the value of v above 0x10 that makes the ID 8-bit again.
