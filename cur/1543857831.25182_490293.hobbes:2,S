It was not related to trim fetching. Yes, it very likely that the boards
i2c controller (i2c-iop3xx) is has a bug, but I'm not competent enough to
find out what it is actually sending out to the wire.
With your patch, the rtc acts like the chip would completely ignore the
"address" transfer, and starts reading from the last (default) register
anyway. Thus all the regs look shifted by one in the driver. With current
git driver results look like:
# cat /proc/driver/rtc ; sleep 1 ; echo one sec gone; cat /proc/driver/rtc
rtc_time        : 06:16:55
rtc_date        : 2006-12-11
24hr            : yes
32.768 KHz
trim    : 1
one sec gone
rtc_time        : 06:16:56
rtc_date        : 2006-12-11
24hr            : yes
32.768 KHz
trim    : 1
And same after your patch:
rtc_time        : 16:23:28
rtc_date        : 2012-11-01
alrm_time       : **:01:00
alrm_date       : ****-**-**
alrm_wakeup     : no
alrm_pending    : no
24hr            : yes
crystal         : 32.768 KHz
trim            : 10
one sec gone
rtc_time        : 16:24:28
rtc_date        : 2012-11-01
alrm_time       : **:01:00
alrm_date       : ****-**-**
alrm_wakeup     : no
alrm_pending    : no
24hr            : yes
crystal         : 32.768 KHz
trim            : 10

Why is this method considered more portable? Howabout making the read
method a module parameter?
