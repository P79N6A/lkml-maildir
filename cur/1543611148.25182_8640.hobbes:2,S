Okay. I don't think that performance will be a problem in the near
future. As you no doubt know, the DOJ is "requiring" that these
taps be inserted into Operating Systems so that they can access
computers, of course always in direct correspondence with a
wiretap order (if you believe that, I've got a bridge to sell).
Information is that part of M$ agreement with DOJ was to insert
these taps into their OS. In due course, we will have to counter
this by emulation, i.e., always return a nice new, never touched
distribution disk when queried for a directory <grin>, but
presently, if there are "hooks" for "future enhancements", the
DOJ can't refuse to allow the sale or distribution of an OS
as is now proposed.
Once the DOJ actually reads the Constitution, this problem may
go away altogether, but presently the knee-jerk reaction from 9/11
is to violate everybody's computers!
Cheers,

    I was going to compile a list of innovations that could be
    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
