FWIW, being able to have large (8-64kB) blocksize would be great for
ext2/3/4.  We'd sort of been betting on this by limiting the on-disk
extent format to 48-bit physical block numbers, and to have 2 patches
to implement this in as many weeks is excellent.
To me the mechanism doesn't matter, whether through fsblock or high-order
PAGE_SIZE.  I'll let the rest of you duke it out as long as at least one
of them makes it into the kernel.
Cheers, Andreas
