Quoting the FAQ:
"Don't attach huge files to your post.  One major culprit is people
attaching their kernel .config file to their post."
These days people get flamed for _not_ attaching their .config to
their post :-)
Also:
"Stick to the subject.  This is a Linux kernel list, mainly for
developers."
--- developers."
+++ developers to discuss technical issues, start flame wars, and
+++ generally use at least 50% of the bandwidth on non-kernel issues.
:-)
