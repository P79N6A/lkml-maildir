Because without them we need a user space tool or kernel policy add on
that doesn't yet exist.

But, isn't that, in part, the point of this discussion.  Sg with no code
changes will stand the expansion of the kernel dev_t.  There is only a
problem if you want the device numbers dynamically assigned.

That discussion doesn't have much to do with the size of the kernel
dev_t, though.  For dynamic devices, it's just a number.

Erm, I'm afraid I believe the idea to be based on leveraging the
existing infrastructure, so I'd be surprised if much kernel work were
required (well beyond what is already planned for hotplug, anyway).

I don't see how the current patches break anything, yet.  I've already
said how I plan to use a larger kernel dev_t in SCSI.

I said in my last mail that "thanks to the work of Al Viro and others,
the problem of dynamic majors for block devices lies predominantly in
user space".  The piece that you label "trivial" is the missing
character device and user space components.  I don't happen to believe
it is at all trivial, but you're welcome to prove me wrong.
