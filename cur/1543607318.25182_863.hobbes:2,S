Tim,
Thanks for the tip, but it's not helping. I've tried
"irq=auto" and "irq=7" but it still wont play.
I just noticed that CONFIG_PARPORT_PC_FIFO is set to NO
and I'm rebuilding with it set to YES to see if that
helps...
This option was also off when I was using 2.4.10 so
I'm not sure if it will help.
