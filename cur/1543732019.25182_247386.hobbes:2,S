It comes down to the relative importance of:
i.  BUG_ON(expensive_and_unneeded_debug_test())
ii. BUG_ON(something_that_must_execute())
I think case i should get priority, since then the
removal of side effects is a nice way to eliminate
the expensive code for non-debug builds.
For case ii, it's easy enough to split out the
need-to-execute code and assign results to a
variable that can be checked later. Since it is
something that must execute, you probably need
the return value anyway.
The normal expectation for non-debug builds
would be this:
#define BUG_ON(x)
