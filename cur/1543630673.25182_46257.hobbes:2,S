   alpha and sparc64 at least already do them.
   I wouldn't mind making the PCI domain support a bit more explicit, 
   though.  I think it's fair to be able to obtain a pointer to "struct 
   pci_domain", which would most likely be defined in asm/pci.h for each arch.
We are going to end up soon with generic devices in 2.5.x
and we might as well end up with a "struct bus" too, which
can provide the domain abstraction in a bus-type independant
way.
