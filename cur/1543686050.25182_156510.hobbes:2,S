That ought to be balanced with "don't screw up the revision history, people
use it".  It's one thing to reformat code that is unreadable, for the most
part this code didn't come close to unreadable.

I wasn't suggesting that.  I was saying
	if (expr) statement;		// OK
I was not endorsing this sort of unreadable crap:
	if (expr) statement; else statement;
The exception I was saying was reasonable is if you are doing something like
	if (!pointer) return (-EINVAL);
Short, sweet, readable, no worries.
