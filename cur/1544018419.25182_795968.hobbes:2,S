We are aware of this warning issue. We will soon have a fix for this.
For now, this is benign (essentially mmap of /dev/mem is doing
the reserve_memtype() twice, one through phys_mem_access_prot_allowed()
and reserve_pfn_range(). We are planning to remove this double
reserve, which should fix the warning).

This one is fixed in tip by commit a1e46212a410793d575718818e81ddc442a65283
	x86: fix page attribute corruption with cpa()
