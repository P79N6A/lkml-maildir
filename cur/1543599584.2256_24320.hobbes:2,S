That's a separate problem - we can't catch the exact state of process
at the moment of death, indeed, but in theory we could make sure that
no changes happen while we write the thing out.  As it is, coredump is not
only taken at some point after death, it doesn't correspond to state of
the thing at _any_ moment.
