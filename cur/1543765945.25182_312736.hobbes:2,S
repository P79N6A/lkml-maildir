Can you tell me which ones?
And if there are really that many tools, which are dependent on
those information, wouldn't it be much more senseful to make
it (as far as possible) the same?
I must say I was really impressed, how easy I got the number of
cpus on *BSD (I am not a bsd user, still impressed).
They also have the same format on every arch and mostly the same
between different bsds (as far as I have seen).
In general, where are the advantages of having very different cpuinfo
formats? Tools would need to know less about the arch and could
depend on "I am on Linux" only.
Just some thoughts,
Nico
