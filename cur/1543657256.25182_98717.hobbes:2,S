this is my soundcard (from lspci -v):
00:0f.0 Multimedia audio controller: Ensoniq 5880 AudioPCI (rev 02)
        Subsystem: Ensoniq Creative Sound Blaster AudioPCI128
        Flags: bus master, slow devsel, latency 64, IRQ 5
        I/O ports at d800 [size=64]
        Capabilities: <available only to root>
I'm using alsa on 2.5.5x and alsa-0.9 on 2.4.2x and all works fine... so what 
kernel(s) are you using and do you have OSS or ALSA drivers??
