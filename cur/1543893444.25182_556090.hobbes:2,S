The corrupted orphan inode list bug I fixed,
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=2988a7740dc0dd9a0cb56576e8fe1d777dff0db3
is in that fc7 kernel, so that's probably not it (though your fc6 kernel
probably didn't have that fix)  (it's related to link & unlink racing)
Perhaps this could be related to Vasily's issue w/ bad_inodes not
getting removed from the list ?
[RFC PATCH ext3/ext4] orphan list corruption due bad inode
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/6/4/7
I haven't looked at all the ways we could get bad inodes on the orphan
inode list, and not properly removed...
