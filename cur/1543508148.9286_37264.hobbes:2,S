Hello,
I'm hoping someone might have a suggestion for me.  I'm using a Siemens box
using v2.2.11 and running some I/O generation programs to an external
storage device.  When I get to approximately 300 processes running on my
host, the host will hang.  Nothing seems to work to revive it, including the
magic keys.  
I have edited tasks.h to be 1024 instead of the 512 default so that
shouldn't be it.  
Any ideas on what I should have tuned and didn't?
TIA!
Heather
