I'm trying to setup an Ultra 10 Sparc machine with RedHat 6.0, but when I
stress the disk load (f.i. with squid) it hangs with an steady error:
SIR Reset
I've tried also RedHat 5.2 and the latest Redhat-6.0 RPMS (kernel
2.2.5-22), but it keeps on hanging :(
Can anybody give me a clue of how to fix this error?
In the driver documenbtation it talks about sym53c8xx instead of
ncr53c8xx, but it doesn't exist for Sparc.
Any help?
Thanks
Pau
