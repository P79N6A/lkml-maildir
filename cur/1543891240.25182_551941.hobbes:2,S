That is going to be a bitch to implement for HID devices which can be
all of the above at once.

Yes, here I agree. There are quirks to be worked out.
There is one more thing. If we alias KEY_FN_ESC through KEY_FN_B as
KEY_GENACT* this will give us 20 general-purpose actions. If we add
something like EVIOGSCANCODE to retrieve reverse mapping then
distributions like Matthew's can just scan new input devices in udev
and remap to KEY_GENACT* while we employ KEY_UNKNOWN + scancode on
kernel level.

Ok, different experiences I guess...
