I have tested it on a Pentium M machine. Without the unmask LVTPC the 
nmi handler collected precisely one interrupt. With the LVTPC unmask the 
OProfile data collection worked normally.

My theory is that the Pentium M uses same bus interface and local apic 
as the Pentium M. Thus, the Pentium M shares the Pentium 4 need to 
unmask LVTPC.

Yes, I tested the nmi watchdog and it currently does not work on the 
Pentium M. It doesn't get the later interrupts and states it is stuck.
