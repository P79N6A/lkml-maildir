Subject: [OT] ipchains premade filter scripts?

I've got a filter script that I've been working on for quite some
time now that is shaping up quite nicely, however I've been
wanting to see other people's ipchains scripts for similar or
even extremely complex situations.
I've done various websearches, and most turn up the obvious HOWTO
documents, etc and obsolete ipfwadm premade scripts.  I've
adapted some stuff from ipfwadm scripts to the ipchains
counterparts, however I'd like to hone my script based on some
prime examples of good firewall scripts.
Can anyone suggest some URL's for ipchains based firewall
tutorials or sample scripts, or scripts that are actually in use
somewhere?
They seem to be quite elusive.  BTW, I've read all networking
related HOWTO's, etc...
