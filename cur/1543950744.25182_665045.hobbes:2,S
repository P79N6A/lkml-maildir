I think we can do with a smb_wmb(); like Christoph (and like
hlist_add_rcu()), but replace the smb_rmb() Christoph has with a
smp_read_barrier_depends().
That should give much the same results.
The reason Christoph can do without RCU is because he doesn't allow
unregister, and as soon as you drop that you'll end up with something
similar.

Curious problem indeed. Would it make sense to require registering these
MMU notifiers when the process is still single threaded along with the
requirement that they can never be removed again from a running process?
For KVM this should be quite doable, but I must admit I haven't been
paying enough attention to know if its possible for these other users.
