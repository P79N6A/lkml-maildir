The compiler _should_ entirely compile away "fix_to_virt(xxx)", so by 
creating a variable for the value, you're actually making code generation 
worse. You might as well have
	#define mmcfg_virt_addr (fix_to_virt(FIX_PCIE_MCFG))
instead.
That said, this patch looks perfectly acceptable to me. With some testing, 
I'd take it through Greg or -mm.
