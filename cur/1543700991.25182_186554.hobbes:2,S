What were these errors?

It sounds like the SuSE init scripts are being clever and probably only
know about how their 2.4 situation works.  What we need is a SuSE person
to comment on this behaviour; I don't have access to any SuSE based
systems to investigate their quirks.

"still" ?  This is news to me (as the guy who seems to be handling both
PCMCIA and serial.)

"hang up"?  Do you mean "on-hook" or do you mean "stop working"?  Is
there anything in /var/log/messages about this?
On my RH systems, cardmgr logs a fair amount to the system messages log,
which includes details of any commands run and any failures.  It would
be really useful to see this.
