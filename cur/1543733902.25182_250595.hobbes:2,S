This reminds me of a paper someone wrote on how HFS(+) stored the file 
type (actually, application that knows how to use the file) as metadata, 
separate from the filename.  He was lamenting the fact that the Mac was 
being 'corrupted' by the PC's broken philosophy of including as part of 
the filename something which should not be.  He also mentioned that 
Windows' feature of hiding the extension doesn't cut it.  One benefit, I 
recall, was that you can't change the association accidentally when 
changing the filename.  Another thing was that file name and file type 
are not semantically related, so they shouldn't be squished together.
I don't remember this well enough, so I can't argue the point, but 
having the file type as metadata separate from the filename has SOME 
amount of elegant appeal to me.
