Hi, 
This patch fixes the SMP problems for Steve.  It was a thinko I put in to check things...  In SMP 
it was just plain broken.  Patch is against 2.4.26 with Craig's patches but works on 2.5.27 and 
2.4.x too.  My bk tree with slablru based on linux-2.4-rmap at casa.dyndns.org:3334 has also 
been updated.
Thanks,
Ed Tomlinson
