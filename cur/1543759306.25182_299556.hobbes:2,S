As an experiment I ran "bitbake meta-sdk" on my copy of openemedded. A while 
later I have these in the deploy directory amongst other things.

"bitbake binutls-cross-sdk" and "bitbake gcc-cross-sdk" are more efficient 
as they won't build all the other things in the sdk.
Generating a cross compiler from oe really is as simple as that. Setting up 
oe in the first place is a bit more tricky but too bad.
An improvement to the current situation might be some instructions and links 
to oe to tell people they can build a toolchain this way. Better still 
someone could run the above commands now and again and upload the files 
somewhere. I don't have anywhere I can host files that size on a permanent 
basis. I possibly could be persuaded to run the commands now and again if 
people were going to use the results. I'm in two minds though as generating 
your own from openembedded isn't difficult. Writing instructions for setting 
up oe to build it may be the best option.
