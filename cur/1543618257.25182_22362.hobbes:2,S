Why does it need to know how suitable it is compared to the other 
subcaches?  It just ages X pages, and depends on the VM to determine how 
large X is.  The VM pressures subcaches in proportion to their size, it 
doesn't need to know  how suitable one page is compared to another, it 
just has a notion of push on everyone in proportion to their size.

Chris, the VM doesn't compare one page to another within a unified 
cache, so why should it compare one page to another within the delegated 
cache management scheme?  The VM ages until it gets what it wants, in 
the current scheme.  In the scheme I propose it requests aging from the 
subcaches until it gets what it wants, instead of doing aging until it 
gets what it wants.
Note that there is some slight inaccuracy in this, in that the current 
scheme has ordered lists, but my point remains valid, especially if we 
move to aging based on usage minus age counts, which I think Rik may be 
supportive of do (it makes it easier to give less staying power to a 
page that is read only once, and I would say it was Rik's idea except 
that I have probably distorted it in repeating it).

Thanks for pointing out what needed to be articulated.  Is it more clear 
now?
