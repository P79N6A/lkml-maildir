Thanks, Martin: we know very well that we cannot increase MAX_SWAPFILES
without going through all the architectures adjusting their swap ptes
(and maybe making MAX_SWAPFILES_SHIFT per-arch), so I don't see any
problem there.  But Christoph has observed that the comment becomes
out-of-date, so updated patch (adding your ack) below...
Remove unnecessary obfuscation from sys_swapon's range check on swap
type, which blew up causing memory corruption once swapless migration
made MAX_SWAPFILES no longer 2 ^ MAX_SWAPFILES_SHIFT.
