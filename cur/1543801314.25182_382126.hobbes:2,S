Of course I don't expect every end user with a problem to file a bug
report (although Mantis makes it much easier than Bugzilla) but I sure
as hell expect people who complain about ALSA on LKML to.
Unless we get some useful bug reports out of it this thread is much ado
about nothing.  Come on people, put up or shut up.
