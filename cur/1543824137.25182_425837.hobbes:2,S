Yup.  Note that you can hit the array switch without this patch as well,
but with it, you'll hit it for sure if you're at 100% cpu.

Agreed.  That will reinstate terminal starvation in some cases, but
those cases are much less common than this one.
In my tree, I don't use the expired array for anything except batch
tasks any more for this very reason. The latency just hurts too bad.
