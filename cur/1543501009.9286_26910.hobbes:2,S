Subject: Very strange bug in VFS & modules

I've come across a really odd bug... I'm using linux 2.3.5 (this bug does not
appear with 2.2.* kernels).
If I compile a filesystem up as a module, load it into the kernel, and then
mount something with it, the following things occur:
  * The "file" program says the mount point is a directory
  * The "ls" program says that it isn't.
  * The "umount" and "sync" programs cause an oops to happen in
    sync_all_inodes().
  * Examining /proc/kcore shows that the root inode has a NULL i_op value.
  * A printk() placed at the end of the read_super() function shows that this
    i_op is set to the correct value.
What is stranger is that if the filesystem is compiled into vmlinux instead of
being a module, then the filesystem works correctly and none of the problems
happen.
Any ideas?
