Or just send those patches earlier :)

That would be nice to do, but it would have been doing 2 things in one
patch, not good.

Works for me :)

Please let me know if it does.  Did you put the modalias on the
usb_device or the interface?  It belongs on the interface, as this patch
does.
cur_altsetting could be NULL pretty early in the initialization phase of
a USB device, but by the time these files are created, it should be fine
(otherwise this same check in the hotplug call would also fail, right?)

Send them on, let's see what you have, and we can take it from there.
