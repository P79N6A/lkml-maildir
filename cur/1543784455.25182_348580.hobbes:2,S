I'm with Jan on this.  I use a similar patch for frame pointers on
x86_64 most of the time, in the hope of getting more accurate backtraces.
Is x86_64 somehow more likely to give you a less noisy backtrace than
i386?  Fewer of those stale return addresses from earlier trips down
the stack?
Frame pointers are imperfect on all(?) the supported architectures,
but I can't see any good reason to exclude them from x86_64.  Just a
couple of weeks ago LKML had a bug where enabling frame pointers on
x86_64 helped Ingo to pinpoint the origin of the problem.
