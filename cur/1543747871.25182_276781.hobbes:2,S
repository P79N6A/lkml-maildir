I must be doing something wrong cauz I still get the same error when I try
to apply the patch.
I use :
patch -p0 < r8169-mini-fix.patch 
patching file drivers/net/r8169.c
Hunk #1 FAILED at 1161.
1 out of 1 hunk FAILED -- saving rejects to file drivers/net/r8169.c.rej
Dump of rej file :
***************
*** 1161,1167 ****
  static inline void rtl8169_make_unusable_by_asic(struct RxDesc *desc)
  {
-       desc->addr = 0x0badbadbadbadbad;
        desc->status &= ~cpu_to_le32(OWNbit | RsvdMask);
  }
--- 1161,1167 ----

  {
+       desc->addr = 0x0badbadbadbadbadull;
        desc->status &= ~cpu_to_le32(OWNbit | RsvdMask);
  }
I saved the file from my windows machine (outlook 2003) to a samba share on
the machine needed to be patched. 
I don't believe that has anything to do with it, right ?
When commenting the line out the module did compile but It still connection
froze after a while like before.
I tried to apply the patch in both kernel versions same result.
Am I missing something ?
Thank you for your patience
