Since Linux doesn't panic, ACPI turns into a no-op.  Yes that's better than
Windows 2000 blue screening, but no it's not as good as APM support.
The present status of APM support is that the command "apm -s" still
suspends the laptop but the hotkey Fn+F10 gets ignored.  In kernel 2.4.19
the hotkey was interpreted as a more power-hungry variation of standby (same
as "apm -S") so I hacked 2.4.19 to make it do suspend, but in kernel
2.6.0-test3 the hotkey doesn't even reach the apm driver.  But this is a
separate issue from the one that caused you to think I should turn on ACPI's
failures.

Then it *is* a problem with dependencies.  In kernel 2.6.0-test1 through
test3, I set all configuration options myself, instead of inheriting
anything from SuSE's 2.4.19 defaults.  I compiled 2.6.0 without ACPI.  Since
this is not an ACPI-enabled kernel, no one should be expecting me to use
ACPI routing.

But this combination of facts remains very curious:
In 2.4.19, where the kernel is still ACPI-enabled, where it is absolutely
   necessary for me to use "acpi=off apm=on", it doesn't warn to use
   "pci=usepirqmask".
In 2.6.0-test3, where the kernel is not ACPI-enabled (because I
   config'ed it not to be), where it is redundant for me to use
   "acpi=off apm=on", it is warning me to use "pci=usepirqmask".
This combination of facts is exactly the opposite of what you think it
should be.  I'd say it looks like a bug in a dependency condition.
