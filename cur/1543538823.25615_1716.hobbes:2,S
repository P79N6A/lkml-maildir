I should be signed

Partial but incomplete fix. I think it also should be checking if
60*HZ*value is an overflow..

Cleaner is
	{
		signed long room = sk->sndbuf - atom..
		...
	}

Should just be board.port == 0 ??

Fix the type of card->foo_num to be signed instead - the fix is right.

No. You can allocate over 2Gigs in a shared memory segment, and there are
a few people who actually configure and do this with some hacks in 2.2, let
alone 2.4.
