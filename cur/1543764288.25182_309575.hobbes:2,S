ah, yes, sysenter. SYSENTER creates a degenerate 'small' stackframe with 
an esp0 that is missing the 5 entry words relative to the normal entry 
(int80 or irq) esp0 stackframe. These 5 words are: xss, esp, eflags, 
xcs, eip. The sysenter code sets them up manually.
now if an interrupt hits at this point, it will set up a 'same privilege 
level' stackframe, which has eip/xcs/eflags, i.e. no esp/xss. If upon 
irq-return we then examine the stack due to your patch, it will be an 
incorrect stackframe -> kaboom.
your patch doesnt remove the condition, it only removes the crash, 
because it adds the 2 words space that is needed - but the information 
relied on by your irq-return test is still bogus. At this point i'd 
suggest to remove the ESP patch altogether.
the correct solution is to always let the sysenter path set up a full 
and correct stackframe, before allowing preemption (see the attached 
patch). This was a nasty bug in the waiting. (I have not made this 
conditional on CONFIG_PREEMPT, to keep it simple and because the impact 
to irq latency is small and predictable. There's no runtime overhead.)
so i think with the help of Stas the mystery has been fully explained 
and solved. Linus?
