zeus.kernel.org has suffered what appears to be a multiple disk RAID
failure, and no longer appears to boot.  I can't do any further
diagnostic without physical access to the machine; however, there is a
good chance we have lost a RAID.
I will attempt to bring the machine back, but, in the meantime, I
would like to ask if there is anyone or any company who would be
willing to donate eight (8) 73 GB SCA SCSI disks on short notice.  We
have been suffering from a shortage of space on the affected RAID for
quite a while, and if it is truly dead it might be reasonable to
replace the drives with higher-capacity ones instead.
Please email me if you would be able to help.
