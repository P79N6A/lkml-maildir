Hi,
I have also seen such offsets on some boxes running at EADS (a Compaq 
Proliant [<-- this one has a very small offset] and a no name machine 
[<-- this one is terrible in 10 minutes 2-3 minutes too fast]). I have 
no numbers at the moment.
If you need some more information please contact me.
I tried to fix this issue also, but haven't found any solution. Both 
servers are running SuSE Linux I think on 8.x (2.4 kernel). I don't know 
at the moment if we tried already an update to 2.6 kernel.
For the moment our fix is a 10 minute cronjob which execute
hwclock --hctosys
because hardware clock is running correct.
A fix or a hint whats wrong would be very nice :-).
Cheers,
Michael Obster
