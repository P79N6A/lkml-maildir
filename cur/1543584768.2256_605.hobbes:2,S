Well, I'm not absolutely sure if we are talking about the same thing: what 
I have is a re-labeled PC-Card modem which identifies according to
cardctl ident:
  product info: "LUCENT-VENUS", "PCMCIA 56K DataFax"
  manfid: 0x0200, 0x0001
  function: 2 (serial)
ATI:
Venus K56FLEX V.90 kfav163 PCMCIA p52198

PCMCIA's serial_cs of course) under Linux 2.0/2.2/2.4.
