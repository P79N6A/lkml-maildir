Not sure if this is terribly useful. It just makes it harder to pull
the subset you're interested in.

You can't drop old objects without dropping all the changesets that
refer to them or otherwise being prepared to deal with the broken
links.

The latter can be done in a pretty straightforward manner in mercurial
with one pass over the data. But I have a goal to make keeping the
whole history cheap enough that no one balks at it.

What is a tree re-linker? Finds duplicate files and hard-links them?
Ok, that makes some sense. But it's a win on one machine and a lose
everywhere else.

I've added an "hg verify" command to Mercurial. It doesn't attempt to
fix anything up yet, but it can catch a couple things that git
probably can't (like file revisions that aren't owned by any
changeset), namely because there's more metadata around to look at.
I'll probably post an updated version tomorrow, I'm beginning to work
on a git2hg script.
