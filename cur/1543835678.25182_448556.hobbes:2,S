Some very interesting comments and suggestions! Thanks very much for all the
info, that's exactly the sort of stuff I needed.

My current idea is to divide the interfaces by GPIO device and port. I've so far
not seen a GPIO device that couldn't be divided into ports of <= 32 bits. How
wide can a 'port' actually become?
Somehow I think that a separate device/file for each pin or possibly even port 
might not be a wise idea. For example, twiddling individual pins on a GPIO when 
you connect an LCD, I2C, or SPI interface seems extremely inefficient...

Yes, very good idea! So far I haven't managed to fry any chips by driving a 
pulled up/down output, but it's so easy to make the mistake...
