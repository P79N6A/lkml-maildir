That's very good news, Adrian.  In the past all we had to go on
was the memory of a machine that died several years ago.
But if you've got a live failure, that is really valuable.
Please go here
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=ACPI
and submit a new sighting vs. Power-Thermal
and attach the output from acpidump, cat /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/*/*
and assign it to len.brown@intel.com
thanks,
