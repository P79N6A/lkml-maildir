The following was meant 100% seriously:
This patch has been sent on:
- 16 May 2006
- 1 May 2006
- 23 Apr 2006
If me resending this old patch collides with something finally getting a 
user this part of my patch shouldn't be applied now (but you might get 
it again in 6 months if it's still unused...).
But generally such conflicts would become visible if "known development 
trees that are intended for mainline" were in -mm.
