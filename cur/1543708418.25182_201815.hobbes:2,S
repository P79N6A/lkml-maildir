In 2.4, you can do what you like.  The list of PCI devices is in PCI
bus number order, and that's the order you get when you use the hotplug
interfaces.  Yes, this is a painful customer-visible change, but if
they use scsi discs, they must already be used to devices changing name
at random.

to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince 
himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
