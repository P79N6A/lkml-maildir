So how does that invalidate my point?  Intel did jump through a lot of
hoops to avoid giving away the code that controls their radio.  When
the regulatory daemon stuff got too much complaints, they finally
redid their firmware to avoid the daemon.  But they still have not
exposed the details on how to control their radio.

Yes, that is a nice solution.  Provided that you have any firmware at
all.  But price is everything, chips become dumber and dumber and more
control functions are pushed to the host.  If you want to sell a device
in Korea, price is everything; if you can shave off 30 cents by putting
the firmware in ROM, or by using 1.5 mbits of flash instead of 2 mbits,
that means an increase in market share or profit margins.

I definitely agree.  I think it's stupid of companies to hide away
their documentation out of fear of, well, something.  I find it
extremely frustrating when I bought a device touted as "the first open
Linux mobile", just to find out that it used a binary-only kernel module
for the M-Systems DiskOnChip.  A quite nice phone, but due to that one
module, it was completely impossible to use anything but the ancient
2.4 kernel it came with.
I also think that my customers, that decided to keep their kernel
modules binary only, made a big mistake and have told them so.  But I
still think it's better for the Linux community to be a bit soft on
such companies for a while.  It's better to let them get away with it
for a while, and slowly try to convince them about the error of their
ways, rather than see them go with Windows CE or a BSD.
