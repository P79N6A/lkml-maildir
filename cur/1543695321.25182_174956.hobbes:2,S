If I understand you correctly, there may never have been a bad block.
That is good for Toshiba, no reason to say bad things about their disks.
Also, if there was no bad block, then no reallocation is needed.
You show that dd reads this sector without problems.
But you see an I/O error when it is just at the edge of the partition.
That I/O error may well be generated by Linux, not by the disk.
The details depend on kernel version, and I forgot what kernel
you used. Try  blockdev --getbsz /dev/hda  to see what blocksize
Linux is using. If that is 4096, that is 8 sectors, but only 6 sectors
remain in the partition. Try  blockdev --setbsz 512 /dev/hda
and read again. Maybe this would succeed.
