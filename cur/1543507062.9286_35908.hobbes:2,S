Well, *that* was interesting (the changes between 2.3.14 and 2.3.15).
Replacing ip_fw with netfilter may have been the straw that broke
*this* camel's back: the changes to ENskip that will be necessary
to get it working with kernels 2.3.15 and later won't come soon
(if at all) from me.  Please note the 2.2.X kernels are still supported.
I'll try to clarify the next few points one final time for the benefit
of those who might like to try ENskip.  I live in the U.S.  My patches
contain no cryptographic algorithms and therefore are NOT subject to
export restrictions, i.e., non-U.S. users may legally accept/use my
patches.  See the ENskip-0.67 web page
	
http://www.tik.ee.ethz.ch/~skip/
for more information if you would like to try an alternative IPv4
IPSEC implementation that works on Linux, Win95, and Solaris (at
least).
I wish my neighbors to the north (Henry Spencer et. al.) much success
in their efforts to get IPSEC working with IPv4.  Perhaps the recent
kernel changes will make their job easier.
