Are you absolutely sure?  My laptop, (same software versions), wakes up the hard disk successfully after a -Y sleep, (although on 2.2.13 it used to generate a spurious interupt message first).
Also, from the hdparm MAN page, it says "A hard or soft reset is  required before  the  drive can be accessed again (the Linux IDE driver will automatically handle issuing a reset if/when needed).
A -y standby achieves the expected behaviour, (I.E. automatic spin up), with no errors.
