Audio-only CD players are cheap and dumb.  The standard audio CD format 
is not complex, and certain parts of the disc that are needed for data 
CDs are ignored by audio players.  This is where the copy-protected 
discs use false data to confuse CDROM drives.

Nobody asked you to bypass the protection, only to sanely error out when 
it is found.  Refusing to read the disk is ok, but allowing the system 
to crash is not.
