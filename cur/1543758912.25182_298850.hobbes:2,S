Nah, this is wrong :)
We actually _want_ pte_cmpxchg on ppc64, because we can do the stuff,
but it requires some careful manipulation of some bits in the PTE that
are beyond linux common layer understanding :) Like the BUSY bit which
is a lock bit for arbitrating with the hash fault handler for example.
Also, if it's ever used to cmpxchg from anything but a !present PTE, it
will need additional massaging (like the COW case where we just
"replace" a PTE with set_pte). We also need to preserve some bits in
there that indicate if the PTE was in the hash table and where in the
hash so we can flush it afterward.
