OK...  I'll bite.  ACCESS_ONCE(), see 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/11/664.
This would allow ACCESS_ONCE(atomic_read(&x)) to be used where refetching
would be problematic, but allow the compiler free rein in cases where
refetching is OK.
The ACCESS_ONCE() primitive of course has its limitations as well, but
you did ask for a middle ground.  ;-)
