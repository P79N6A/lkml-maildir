The Yamaha sound driver doesnt handle the case where the bios fails to restore
the chip status and expects a windows driver to do its dirty work. That
requires on resume that the device is completely reloaded.
A workaround is to make it a module, unload it before suspend and reload it
after resume but thats pretty umm uggly.
