Can you elaborate?  Autodetect what?  Autodetect if the BIOS supports LBA?
(BTW, "LBA mode" is purely setting CHS = x/255/63, right?
It's not like anything is getting enabled/disabled?)

Sure.  But can we estimate anyway?  Do a "random" survey?
* does more than 1% of the Windows market use a boot manager other
than Windows'/lilo/grub?  (Guess: No)
* what proportion of Windows users do any configuration themselves?
What about the OEM installers?  (Aren't these a high proportion?) 
(Guess: 90% OEM; 1% of users do boot config)
* do OEM installers generally use LBA?  (Guess: no idea)
Maybe the students/academics here should poke around their university
campuses.  I'm not sure how we could unobtrusively check!  Some BIOS
POST screens show useful info.
Cheers,
Andrew
