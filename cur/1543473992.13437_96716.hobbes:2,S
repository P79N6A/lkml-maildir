I have seen TCP checksum errors from Demon with `novj', so that's not a
solution.  They are rarer, though.
I've done the sums by hand, and seen that the raw PPP data (as dumped by
the kernel when PPP debugging is turned on) really does contain invalid
TCP checksums.  The IP header checksums are fine.
The erroneous packets I looked at in detail appear to be misrouted to my
machine, too.  (I shouldn't be receiving them).
