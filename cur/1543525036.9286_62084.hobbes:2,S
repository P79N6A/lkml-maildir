This has already been fixed in the latest glibc pre-releases, and the
change will certainly be in glibc-2.1.3.  If you are curious, you can
also get the stand-alone ptmalloc release:
    
http://www.malloc.de/ptmalloc.tar.gz
which has these changes.
When sbrk() fails (e.g. due to the address space limitations discussed
extensively in this thread), an attempt is now made to create a new
arena in anonymously mmap()ed memory where smaller requests, too, can
be serviced.
Now, where do you all buy those huge amounts of memory ? :-)
(still stuck at 128MB myself...)
