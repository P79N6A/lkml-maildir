Hi Mike.
I have a new version of hdrcheck in works written in perl
and a bit faster too.
I hope to finish it off this weekend and sent it for review.
Could I ask you to pick it up and add the below test to that version
when it hits mainline - assuming that the other patches has hit mainline too.
I do not want this check before we are clean so we basically use it to
check that noone introduce a bug.
And next time please put some effort in the _why_ part more than the
_how_ part of the changelog.
	Sam
