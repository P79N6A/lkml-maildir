I'll know this kernel is ready for merger with the 2.4 when I can finally 
compile it :) ... must have tried 6-7 versions by now ...
Error:
Note...this is something new that I haven't tried to compile before.
Error might be caused by an earlier kernel.
However, 2.5.11 does contain a lot of screen_base changes.
