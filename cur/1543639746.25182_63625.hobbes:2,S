This is not a coincidence.

Sounds like a good idea.  You could put CONFIG_SERIAL and CONFIG_PCMCIA
in there too.

There are many broken things about the arch toplevel config.ins, mostly
due to them starting life as copy-n-paste jobs from arch/i386/config.in
and then slowly diverging.  A brief sampling from my bugs list...
*   CONFIG_KERNEL_ELF
    	Defined in arch/ppc/config.in as "define_bool CONFIG_KERNEL_ELF y".
	Specified in a large number of ppc defconfigs.
	Not used anywhere in the source.
	Appears to be an obsolete artifact.
    CONFIG_ELF_KERNEL
    	Defined in arch/mips/config.in as "define_bool CONFIG_ELF_KERNEL y".
	Specified in a large number of mips defconfigs.
	Not used anywhere in the source.
	Appears to be an obsolete artifact.
*   arch/ia64/config.in has this:
	if [ "$CONFIG_DEVFS_FS" = "y" ]; then
	  bool '    Enable DEVFS Debug Code' CONFIG_DEVFS_DEBUG n
	fi
    but why!?!? Not only does this have a bogus third argument as
    if it were dep_bool, but it defines a symbol already defined
    over in fs/Config.in, which is *included* from this config.in.
*   Most architectures have two global menus "General setup", one from
    their own arch/foo/config.in, one from init/Config.in.
*   One of these two correctly describes the device(s) it supports:
    arch/m68k/config.in:      dep_tristate 'A2091 WD33C93A support' CONFIG_A2091_SCSI $CONFIG_SCSI
    drivers/scsi/Config.in:   dep_tristate 'A2091/A590 WD33C93A support' CONFIG_A2091_SCSI $CONFIG_SCSI
*   What's the story with CONFIG_ALPHA_EV56?  It's defined as a symbol
    three times in arch/alpha/config.in with different banners:
            bool 'EV56 CPU (speed >= 333MHz)?' CONFIG_ALPHA_EV56
    bool 'EV56 CPU (speed >= 366MHz)?' CONFIG_ALPHA_EV56
    bool 'EV56 CPU (speed >= 400MHz)?' CONFIG_ALPHA_EV56
*   WTF?!?  arch/cris/drivers/bluetooth/Makefile has an install: target
    which actually hacks Config.in and Makefile in other directories!?!?!
*   There's a fair bit of confusion between the architectures about
    CONFIG_BINFMT_ELF{,32}...

    Note that the interpretation of CONFIG_BINFMT_ELF appears to be
    "support for largest-ELF" but some 64 bit platforms present this
    to the user as explicitly "64-bit" while other 64 bit platforms
    don't seem to care.  The 32-bit platforms just pretend there's
    no such thing as 64-bits.

I couldn't figure out CONFIG_SOUND_GAMEPORT or CONFIG_INPUT_GAMEPORT either.
