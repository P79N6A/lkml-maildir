Actually if I don't reprogram the timer (and just ignore the value for
example), the work-around code keeps being called again and again very
often (between 1x/minute to 100x/second) after the first failure, even
when the system is idle.
When reprogramming, next failure happens only after stressing the system
again.
So it's not just a race, the impact of the failure on the chip is
permanent and stays till it's reprogrammed.
