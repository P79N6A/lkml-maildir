Thanks for finding that one, but it should be easy to fix. I can remove
the parent pointer in aff_remove_hash and check for that before I try to
rename that entry.

I thought about that one and I know it should be locked. The reason I
don't do right now is, that affs supports hardlinks to dirs. The problem
are especially recursive links, e.g.:
mkdir A
ln A A/B
rm A/B
This is possible with affs, but will already deadlock in vfs.
mkdir A
mkdir A/B
ln A A/B/C
rm A/B/C/A &
rm A/B/C &
rm A/B
Every rm already takes the hash lock of the parent and then I can't
simply also take the hash lock of the dir itself. What I actually want
to do is to insert a reverse is_subdir() check before taking the lock.
On the other hand I was thinking whether I should allow links to dirs at
all and just show them as empty/readonly dirs. For 2.4 that's probably
safer, as it would require a lot of locking changes in vfs and the other
fs to support this properly, particularly moving most of the locking
from vfs into the fs.
bye, Roman
