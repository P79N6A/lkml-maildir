Subject: [PATCH] bsg: Fix build for CONFIG_BLOCK=n
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/25/63

BLK_DEV_BSG was added outside of the if BLOCK check, which allows it to
be enabled when CONFIG_BLOCK=n. This leads to many screenlengths of
errors, starting with a parse error on the request_queue_t definition.
Obviously this wasn't intended for CONFIG_BLOCK=n usage, so just move the
option back in to the block.
Caught with a randconfig on sh.
