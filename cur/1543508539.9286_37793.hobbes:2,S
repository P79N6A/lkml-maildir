What happened to the swsusp (software suspend) patch that was included
in 2.3.x some time ago? Was it completely bad or just too experimental?
Is it still developed? Maybe there's a patch outside the main source? I
simply liked the idea of being able to turn off my computer and have the
same state of it after booting...

Ps. Could anyone answer my 'unresolved errors in scsi and smbfs' post? I
really can't work too long without my scsi and I even don't know
whether it's a known problem or not.
