The futex man pages that have been around for years (certainly since mid 2002)
certainly don't document FUTEX_WAIT as token passing operation, but as atomic
operation:
Say 
http://www.icewalkers.com/Linux/ManPages/futex-2.html
FUTEX_WAIT
This operation atomically verifies that  the  futex
address  still contains the value given, and sleeps
awaiting FUTEX_WAKE on this futex address.  If  the
timeout argument is non-NULL, its contents describe
the maximum duration of the wait, which is infinite
otherwise.   For futex(4), this call is executed if
decrementing the count gave a negative value (indi
cating  contention),  and  will sleep until another
process   releases  the  futex  and  executes   the
FUTEX_WAKE operation.
RETURN VALUE
FUTEX_WAIT
Returns 0 if the process was woken by a  FUTEX_WAKE
call. In case of timeout, ETIMEDOUT is returned. If
the futex was not equal to the expected value,  the
operation  returns  EWOULDBLOCK.  Signals (or other
spurious wakeups) cause FUTEX_WAIT to return EINTR.
so there very well might be programs other than glibc that
depend on this behaviour.  Given that in most cases the race
is not hit every day (after all, we have been living with it for
several years), they probably wouldn't know there is a problem
like that.

Sure, but then you need to write your own locking as well and
can just use the token passing property of futexes there.

Because that requires requeue being done with the cv lock held, which
means an extra context switch.

They aren't needed if CONFIG_PREEMPT.  But with !CONFIG_PREEMPT, they
are IMHO still needed, as spin_lock/spin_unlock call preempt_{disable,enable},
which is a nop if !CONFIG_PREEMPT.
__get_user can't be used though, it should be __get_user_inatomic
(or __copy_from_user_inatomic if the former doesn't exist).

True, preempt_check_resched() is a nop if !CONFIG_PREEMPT and for
CONFIG_PREEMPT spin_unlock will handle it.  Will remove them from the
patch.

I certainly haven't seen his patch.
