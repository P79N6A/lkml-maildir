It's an attempt to prevent the 'C' compiler from doing this:
	movl	(jiffies), %eax   # Read
	incl	%eax              # Modify
	movl	%eax, (jiffies)   # Write
Instead, we want it to do this:
	movl	jiffies, %ebx     # init a pointer
	incl	(%ebx)            # Modify directly
With some gcc versions, it works. Others, it doesn't hurt.
Cheers,

    I was going to compile a list of innovations that could be
    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
