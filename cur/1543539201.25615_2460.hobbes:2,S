Is there any way a linux user app can be given direct access to
hardware? For example:
* a simple driver is loaded.
* the user land app sends an ioctl() to the driver.
* the driver returns the beginning physical address of the pci device
  we're interested in.
* the user app calls something like "ioremap" to memory map the
  registers of that device into its own space in order to be able to
  directly do memory cycles to the device.
Thanks,
