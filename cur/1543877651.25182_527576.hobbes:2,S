I have no idea of which module it crashed on. I didn't investigate that
too much.  I could simply send a trap to guest when 
__pa(addr) != lguest_find_guest_paddr(addr) and see which module it
crashed on.
My block device I used was basically a copy of a RHEL5 system. I only
modified the inittab and fstab to get it working.  So on startup and
doing the udev init was when it crashed.

I forgot that you have a goal to keep lguest small :)
Perhaps we can fork, and have lguest and lguest-lite.
