I suppose it might be worthwhile to search the kernel sources for other
instances of printk("%c"), there's no telling when all distributions will be
up to date with new sysklogd releases...

I believe I have the latest version of klogd...
My NIC is a 3Com PCI 3c556 Laptop Tornado, in a Dell Latitude C600 laptop.
The driver reports the product code as "00" and the rev as "00.0", the date
however is "03-01-00" which sounds fairly reasonable (although the laptop is
brand new).
Needless to say, it also works fine, otherwise I would probably have
attacked the driver first...
