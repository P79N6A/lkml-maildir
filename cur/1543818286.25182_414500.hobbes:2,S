Hmm, an exception could be made for programs like apache.
The user would then create a rule that says that apache is allowed to pass on
file descriptors.
Or a rule could be created for the userspace part of fireflier that would auto-add the cgi-scripts 
to apache's group sid. Which IMHO would be the best, because the user will still have control on
what programs have access to the network. He can see that list at any time, and modify it, if not correct.
If we would simply allow file descriptors to be passed on, he wouldn't have that control.
(none of this is implemented yet)

Ok, so the userspace part of fireflier will have to deal with nfs mounts as a special case.
It should store the rules in "server,path,executable hash" format, and do the inode lookup on startup,
or when the first packet arrives.

Currently it is, until we implement path+hash rules for nfs mounts,etc.
What devices can I safely assume that the inodes won't change over boots/mounts?
Cheers,
