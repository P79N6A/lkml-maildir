Yes, but the -rcX releases aren't done that way.  It's mostly how you
view things.  From a users point of view, do I want to download x.y.z
and apply patches .1 through .N?  Or do I want to download x.y.z and
apply 1 patch to get me to the x.y.z.N level?
Personally, I prefer the "one patch to rule them all" method. :)
