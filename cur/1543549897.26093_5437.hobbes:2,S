I wouldn't like to bet on it.

I suppose so. On a separate issue, the more I look at the poll and select
implementation, the more I'm convinced there's a leak, but I'm not sure it
matters.

Run HandleEx sometime... most of the handles are generally not files,
particularly for a program that uses the perfmon stuff, when it uses heaps of
registry handles and section handles.

Actually, I suppose could look at how /proc does things. Make anonymous
objects just numbered files in a special directory.

But hard to achieve at the moment... Not only would the VFS have to change,
but all the filesystems too.

Better still, just give the syscall a filename, a buffer and a buffer size.

Not a nice thing to add. Care has been taken to decouple the file from the
inode (a dentry sandwich). Also it means more maintanence work on the part of
the VFS.
Care would also have to be taken to avoid a reference count loop: File points
to Inode points to File. Not insurmountable though.

No. The list could never be NULL.

It does, but the internal object name does not change. You cannot create a new
file of the old name whilst it is still open internally.

*shiver*

I really don't like doing that. It's always an important customer who falls
over it.

Then you should stick with the current system.

No.

No I won't. I wasn't really thinking in terms of having a process handles map
as a directory full of fd's, more like a flat file with a list in it.
