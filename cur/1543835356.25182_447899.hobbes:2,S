This is inconsistent with your assertion that pid 0 "is/should be valid"
above.  If you want '0' to mean "not valid" then it's not a valid return
value from kernel_thread() (and arguably that's true, since pid 0 is
permanently allocated to the idle thread.)
I don't particularly care whether you decide to that returning pid 0 from
kernel_thread is valid or not, just that your two points above are at least
consistent with each other.
