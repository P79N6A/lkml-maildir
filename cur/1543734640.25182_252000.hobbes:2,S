This is superior to no flushing; I'll implement that and send out an
incremental update (or if preferred, an update of this patch).

The original bits were merely a consolidation extracted from a since-
dropped feature patch and an unrelated feature patch from mingo and
arjanv; this is an unrelated fix for SGI's stability issue on larger
Altixen. I personally intend to do no further adjustments.
