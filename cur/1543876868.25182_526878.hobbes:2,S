I never claimed there was anything magical about those particular values
and I don't intend to do that in the future. The issue is one of
standardization. As an example, Solaris does use the same device names
for both Zilog 8530 and 8250 ports in spite of naming ethernet devices
based on the hardware type. I just checked the man pages on a Solaris 9
system to be sure. The issue is that the naming should be consistent. I
shouldn't need to know what the hardware is to use what is fundamentally
an abstraction of "serial port" as far as the user is concerned. On
Solaris, I can say "/dev/term/a" and know that I will get the first
serial port if it is available without needing to care if it is the
zs, se or asy driver talking to the hardware.
Note that I'm not suggesting we should do what Solaris does because
Sun decided it was the way to do it. I'm just pointing out an example.

The availability of the specific chip in question is a red herring in
my opinion. I do understand that 8250 compatible chips are very common
and are the most likely serial chips to be used with Linux. However, I
will point out that the define is TTY_MAJOR, not 8250_MAJOR. It seems
to me that whoever named it was thinking in more generic terms.

The point is that people are used to having "ttyS0" mean the first
onboard serial port. I firmly believe that the user-space programs
should need to know as little as possible about the hardware, and it
would be nice to abstract that away from the end user as well. We've
moved toward commonality and standarization in other areas, and I
think we should here as well.
