Hi,
For an application I'm writing I need to know if files in a certain 
directory tree were modified and/or deleted by another process. I 
assume that that tree is mounted on the machine that my app is running 
on. The device it has mounted on can be a local HD, but it can also be 
hosted remotely and mounted over nfs.
I know of FAM, but this is documented to only watch a directory 1 level 
deep, and I need the whole tree to be monitored. Does anyone know a 
solution for this? Does the kernel provide facilities for this?
(Please send me replies directly or via CC, as I am not subscribed to 
the kernel mailinglist)
