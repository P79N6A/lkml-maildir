actually, there was no "SD ranting" going on at all. Klaus reported a 
problem, Martin forwarded it to me, i replied to it and Klaus gave me 
lots of debug info in a very professional way. So please calm down and 
lets get back to the tech topics, ok? (and i'd like to apologize here to 
Karl and Martin for the rough and unjust treatment they received on 
lkml.)
