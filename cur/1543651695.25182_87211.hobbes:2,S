Actually, this isn't as much of an issue with 2.5-as-it-will-soon-be.
The initramfs stuff solves the problem for booting, and is exactly
where boot-time discovery should be.
You will need to ensure sufficient integration with hotplug to deal
properly with such things as external devices (usb, 1394, cardbus/
pcmcia, iscsi, docking stations, etc) and media bays.  But this should
be relatively easy, yes?
Without initramfs, I find current evms' in-kernel discovery to be very
beneficial from the end-user standpoint, but early userpsace is clearly
the proper place for boot-time volume discovery just as it is for eg
nfsroot or similar (gfs root, root on iscsi or usb or 1394).
In short, your new plans are the way to go, but do be sure to take
advantage of all the kernel offers or will offer.
