The original behaviour is kept is ARCH is not set on the
commandline and saved in .kbuild (Kbuild.config in the patch).
The logic goes basically like this:
If there is no .kbuild file then set ARCH = $(SUBARCH)
else set ARCH = saved ARCH from .kbuild.
And then a bit sanity check that the user does not
try to change architecture in the middle.
I actually used um as testing ground for this patch so
it works for um in my way of building um.
I considered switching architectures automagically
but concluded that in most cases when a user change ARCH
then that's because the user forgot to specify ARCH or more
seldom forgot what ARCH was being built in that directory.
