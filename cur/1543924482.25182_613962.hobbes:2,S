Makefiles do normally not pick such variables from the environment.

I'm not seeing what's stupid about this.
I had for years CFLAGS="-O2 -mcpu=v8" set in the environment on a
machine where I compiled virtually all software (including gcc), and 
different similar settings on other machines, without running into any 
problems.
I also doubt it's wanted that the kernel picks up the -I/-L/-R flags
I have set in some environments where many libraries are installed in 
non-standard places.
Altogether:
- normally, Makefiles don't pick environment variables
- most open source software uses GNU autoconf
- GNU autoconf does pick environment variables
- GNU autoconf documents to set *FLAGS in the environment
- the kernel has different needs regarding the *FLAGS than userspace
- automatically using the *FLAGS people have set in their environment
  for userspace software in the kernel will cause problems
- the kernel should have already picked the optimal *FLAGS for you,
  and wanting different flags in the kernel is something quite exotic
