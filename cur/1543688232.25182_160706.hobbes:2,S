PATA stuff will continue to be supported via drivers/ide, I'm only 
shooting for the newer SATA stuff.

ATA tagged command queueing is a bunch of crap.  :)  I'm not sure 
whether I want to implement it or not.
I was referring to _native_ command queueing.  ATA TCQ is something 
different.  ATA TCQ does not allow multiple outstanding scatter/gather 
tables to be sent to the host controller.   Native command queuing does.
