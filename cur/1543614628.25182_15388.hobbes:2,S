Ok, I see what you are asking for.
No, I'm taking a bigger view. A patch is not just a "patch". A patch has a
lot of stuff around it, one being the unknowable information on whether
the sender of the patch is somebody who will do a good job maintaining the
things the patch impacts.
That's something a source control system doesn't give you - but that
doesn't mean that you cannot use a SCM as a tool anyway.

Right. But that's true only if I use SCM as a _personal_ medium, which
doesn't help my external patch acceptance.
So even if I used CVS or BK internally, that's not what people _gripe_
about.  People want write access, not just a SCM.

Well, that's what the filesystem is for me right now ;)
