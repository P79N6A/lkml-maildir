Two easy "get out of jail free" cards.  There are other, more complex
exploits.  You have added one more.  They all require root privileges.
Bottom line: once you are in the chroot jail, you must drop root
privileges, or you defeat the purpose.  Security-conscious coders know
this; it's not Linux-specific behavior or anything.
