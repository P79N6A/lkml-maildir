On AMD Geode BIOSen, we have problems with GPE interrupt storms.  The
attached patch resolves that.  This should be fine for all implementations,
though.

[PATCH] ACPI:  Clear GPE before disabling it
From: William Morrow <william.morrow@amd.com>
On some BIOSen, the GPE bit will remain set even if it is disabled, 
resulting in a interrupt storm.  This patch clears the bit before 
disabling it.
