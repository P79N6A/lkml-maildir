No, it was due to the *lack* of intervention. Depending where I am, my
laptop can have up to 4 ethernet interfaces - onboard, docking station,
wireless card, and the ethernet side of the Xircom ethernet/modem card.
And of course 2.4 and 2.5 kernels number them differntly,  and if I'm
booting single-user /sbin/nameif doesn't get run yes, etc etc etc.
So if I see 'eth2' in a dmesg, I can usually be sure it's not the onboard NIC,
but it could be any one of the other 3 and require some work to disambiguate.
(Yes, 'nameif' does a *wonderful* job of usually keeping all 4 nailed down
to save my sanity - it's just that it seems to fail to do so at the times
it really matters. ;)
