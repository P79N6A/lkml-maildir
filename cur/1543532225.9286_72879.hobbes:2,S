Subject: 2.3.99-pre3 won't compile ncr53c8xx.c

As the subject says, I get
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux-2.3/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2
-fomit-frame-pointer -fno-strict-aliasing -pipe -mno-fp-regs -ffixed-8
-mcpu=ev4 -Wa,-mev6   -c -o ncr53c8xx.o ncr53c8xx.c
ncr53c8xx.c: In function `ncr_script_copy_and_bind':
ncr53c8xx.c:3004: warning: `new' might be used uninitialized in this
function
ncr53c8xx.c: In function `ncr_prepare_setting':
ncr53c8xx.c:3311: structure has no member named `base_io'
... (lots more about base_io)
This is on an AlphaStation 200, Debian 2.1, gcc is egcs-1.1.2.
Can someone please point me to a functional 2.3 kernel that will run on an
AlphaStation 200 (Avanti)? I would like to integrate my bugfixes and
patches for tgafb into 2.3.x but I can't do that unless I have a functional
platform.
Thank you,
