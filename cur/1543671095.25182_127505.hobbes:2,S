Corruption comes here. The journal reply tidies things up that shouldn't
be tidied up. They shouldn't be tidied up because once we reload the
image, things should be in the same state as prior to suspend. If replay
frees a block (thinking it wasn't properly linked or something similar),
it introduces corruption.
