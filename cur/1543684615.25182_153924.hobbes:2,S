Yes, nice cleanup.
Some comments for later - the patch can be applied as it is:
The assignment
	drive->select.b.lba = 0/1;
is done in the first half of init_idedisk_capacity().
I don't think the presence or disabling of HPA has any effect
on b.lba, so there should not be such assignments in the
second, HPA, half.
My standard muttering: id->... should not be modified.
In my source I test drive->head * drive->sect for being nonzero
before dividing.
