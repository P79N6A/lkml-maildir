This is only an example to prove that if an app perform fast switch there is a
higher probability that it touchs few data, and when I say touch I don't mean
only "for(i=0;i<N;i++) touch(data[i]);" but I mean also include I/O operations.
If You fast switch imply that You have a small "time footprint", but to have a
small time footprint You must either load / store few byte or have on both sides
very fast devices.
This does not mean that is always in that way, but, as I've specified in the
previous message, there are a prominent probability.

The TCP/IP layer will split 1Mb into M MTU chunks, but You must wait anyway
to get 1Mb of data. The same for write.

The only thing that I want to prove is there is a "little" probability that :
fast switching app <==> great cache trashing
The app showed as example is an extreme of a typical I/O bound process.
Now to prove that "fast switching app" imply "great cache trashing" You must
have, big data ( great trashing ) as long as low "time footprint" ( high switch
rate ).
To have a low time footprint You need a low computing time between the I/Os.
To have big data together with low time footprint You need that both sides of
I/O channel being very fast.
I want to give You some data.
Suppose that the loop that I shown You is the internal loop of an ftp server,
built upon fast SCSI disk and 100 Mb network card.
Suppose 80 Mb throughput for SCSI and 100 Mb for netcard.
Suppose that we move 32 Kb at a time.
This app can result in a great cache trashing but how will be its switch / sec.?
Without counting the I/O overhead we have ( very simple math ):
Time SCSI = 32 * 1024 * 8 / 80 * 1024 * 1024 = 3.2 ms
Time Net = 32 * 1024 * 8 / 100 * 1024 * 1024 = 2.5 ms
So thinking as 0 the overhead and computing, we have that the switch rate of
this app can't be more than ( and with devices fullfilled ! ):
Switch Rate Max = 1.0 / (0.0032 + 0.0025) = 175 switch / sec.
This built up inside me the opinion that "dangerous" processes ( cache
trashing speaking ) are located into average switching rate.

PIII streaming facilities are not the thing I mean, what I mean is real cache
lines control to lock mapping over memory zones that we want to be covered and 
unmap where we know caching will not help us.

Remember that "buffer" address is continuous only in virtual memory and DMA bus
don't know virt. but only phis. memory ( and 16 Mb limit also ), so the driver
must do its own memory movements, so it touches RAM and fill cache.
