Hi,
I was running top, and I noticed a very odd idle% pop up from time to time:
 11:03am  up 11:04,  1 user,  load average: 2.00, 2.00, 2.00
36 processes: 32 sleeping, 4 running, 0 zombie, 0 stopped
CPU states:  0.4% user,  0.1% system, 99.4% nice, 428639.3% idle
                                                  ^^^^^^^^^
I'm running the rc5des client on both cpu's of my dual PII running 2.2.7.
Nothing bad has happened, but I'm curious as to whether this might be an
overflow in whatever file in /proc top get's its info from...
