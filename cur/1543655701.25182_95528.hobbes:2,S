*We Support 686 Instruction Set* plastered everywhere? ;)
Who cares that a single cmov take some tens of cycles...
(btw, can someone measure that? I have no C3...)

Do not try to optimize "pedal to the metal" without
actually looking at the results.
With "-march=i686" on C3 one will get:
* Non-optimal GCC code generation
* Really Slow (tm) cmovs
* Buggy code (cmov with mem operands)
  if one don't think above two are not enough ;)

Such things need testing. A kernel compile would suffice I guess.
