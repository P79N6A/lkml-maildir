Richard,
I applied the patch on the specified kernel and on boot up I get the
following error messages right after "Starting linuxconf"
INIT: Id "1" respawning too fast: disabled for 5 minutes
for 1 to 6 .. it just sits there!
I cannot get out of it etc.
I did not change any scripts or startup file except for fstab to use the
new device names.
Yes, this is the first time I am trying to use devfs on my PC.
Thanks.
