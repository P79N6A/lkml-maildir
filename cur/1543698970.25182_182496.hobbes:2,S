I presently have /proc/interrupts
 0:  244393560          XT-PIC  timer
but when I tried nvnet driver and onboard
ethernet I think I saw both IRQ7 disabled
and some 8259A spurious interrupt err.
Presently there is no grep timer or TIMER
or 8259A in logs. 8259A has to do with
IO-APIC timer? It would make sense that
nvnet would see apic and lapic on in bios
and linux and look for io-apic timer as
well as apic table, then fail confused.
Is there a link to that patch? I keep deleting
this list it's huge so I lost a patch in a message.
