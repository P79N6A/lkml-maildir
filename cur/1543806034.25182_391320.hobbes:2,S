I would rather not. Whenever I look at struct kref it seems to be an over
abstraction, and as such I find it confusing to work with.  I know
whenever I look at the sysfs code I have to actively remind myself
that the kref in the structure is not a pointer to a kref.
What does the kref abstraction buy?  How does it simplify things?
We already have equivalent functions in atomic_t on which it is built.
It is a funny piece of code to come up in this thread where the
argument has been don't over abstract.... (with reference to pids).
If I can see where struct kref buys something or helps in some way
I will be willing to consider it.
