Subject: sched.c: why -fno-omit-frame-pointer?

kernel/sched.c gets compiled with -fno-omit-frame-pointer, and this was 
already done in kernel 1.0 (sic).
Later, it has been modified to be this way only on some architectures.
It might not be an earthshaking amount, but removing it saves some 
bytes, and there's no visible breakage when running the modified kernel 
on i386.

Is the -fno-omit-frame-pointer still required for some reason, or is 
this a relict that could be removed?
