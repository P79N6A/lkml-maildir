Stop here. You are missing the point - correct mapping is
-CURRENT	x.2y+1.latest
-RELEASE	point of divergence between x.2y an x.2y+1
-STABLE		x.2y.latest
-RC		x.2y.early
-BETA		x.2y-pre and x.2y.very_early
It _is_ isomorphic to *BSD version trees, except that here declaring
x.2y-pre seems to be the only way to say "It IS freeze, DAMNIT!" that
really sinks in...
