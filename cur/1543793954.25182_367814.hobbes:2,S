Ah, okay, you have a flatpanel display, so you really need vesa to program
the mode.

The main problem is that when check_var fails, set_par is not called
which means that the ringbuffer is not set up correctly after switching
from X.
Try this first, then we'll think of a definitive solution later.
Open drivers/video/intelfb/intelfbdrv.c and look at intelfb_check_var().
Look for this particular snippet...
	if (FIXED_MODE(dinfo) &&
	    (change_var ||
	     var->yres_virtual > dinfo->initial_var.yres_virtual ||
	     var->yres_virtual < dinfo->initial_var.yres ||
	     var->xoffset || var->nonstd)) {
		if (first) {
			ERR_MSG("Changing the video mode is not supported.\n");
			first = 0;
		}
		return -EINVAL;
	}
And then insert a line so it looks like this:
	if (FIXED_MODE(dinfo) &&
	    (change_var ||
	     var->yres_virtual > dinfo->initial_var.yres_virtual ||
	     var->yres_virtual < dinfo->initial_var.yres ||
	     var->xoffset || var->nonstd)) {
		if (first) {
			ERR_MSG("Changing the video mode is not supported.\n");
			first = 0;
		}
		intelfb_set_par(info); /* insert this line */
		return -EINVAL;
	}
