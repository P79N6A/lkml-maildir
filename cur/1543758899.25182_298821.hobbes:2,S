But we must at least confirm that these architectures can make these
changes in the future.  If they make no changes then they haven't
benefitted from the patch.  And the patch must be suitable for all
architectures which might hit this scalability problem.

I was suggesting a lock in (or associated with) the pageframe of the page
which holds the pte.  That's just a convenient way of hashing the locking. 
Probably that's not much different from the atomic pte ops.

The atomic ops patch should be coupled with the main patch series.  The mm
counter one we could sneak in beforehand, I guess.

Yes, that seemed sensible, although it may not work out to be as clean as
it appears.
But how would that work allow us to address page_table_lock scalability
problems?
