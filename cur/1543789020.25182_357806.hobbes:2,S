Is there chance to get preview version somewhere? 2.6-capable userland
would be very nice (and zImage would help, too, just for a demo :-).

I was thinking about "huh, is this machine tosa or spitz", but it is
labeled SL-C3000, so it should be spitz.

Wildly offtopic... I got poweradapter with spitz (with funny design)
that says 100V (and lot of japanese letters).. I guess it would be
very bad idea to try it at 240V?

Quite a long list; what is $RPSRC -- that is where are those patches
really placed? Is there some way I can help you (besides obviously
testing)?

Yes, asm/arch/ohci.h seems to be missing... But I should probably do
update, I'm at rc2 with my zaurus hacks now.
