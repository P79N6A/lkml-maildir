what does the ffffffff8010f588 RIP address map to? You can find out by 
building the kernel via DEBUG_INFO, then doing 'gdb vmlinux' and 'list 
*0xffffffff8010f588'. NOTE: the RIP might change in a DEBUG_INFO 
compile, so you'll need to reboot.
Another method is to disassemble the vmlinux via 'objdump -d vmlinux > 
vmlinux.asm', and to search for that RIP value in an editor - could you 
send me the surrounding assembly code? (~20 lines are enough)
