Subject: badblocks fails with promise 100TX2

When I run badblocks, it failed, sometime it hanged OS.
Condition:
    runs 2 badblocks command at same time, check different drives.
    EX) badblocks /dev/hdh4; badblocks /dev/hde4
    /dev/hdh and /dev/hde is connected to promise fasttrak 66
    (with pdc20267 chip). I also tested with fasttrak 100TX2 (with
    pdc20268), and got same results.
    Duron(800)/VT133/VIA686b
    RedHat7.1(with 2.4.10 kernel)
Results:
    They report many blocks(are broken). If I kill one badblocks
    command, another badblocks command stops reporting blocks. 
    I think there is conflict when read out.
    On 2.4.2, there is no problem (but can not use fasttrak 100).
I know, there is some changes on ide-pci.c between 2.4.2 and 2.4.10,
and many changes on pdc202xx.c. Something go wrong?
I just want to build software RAID. But by this problem, I can
not build Software RAID with new promise 100TX2 card.
