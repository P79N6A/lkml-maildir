There are a bunch of CVS .#* files left from this one.
v850_defs.h wants updating to the generic generate-asm-offsets.h
mechanism (check the toplevel Makefile)
Please stop the ugly symlink hell with the linker scripts -
we have vmlinux.lds.S for that.
it should read something like:
#include <linux/config.h>
#ifdef BOARD1
#include "board1.lds"
#else
...
#endif
for v850
Could you please explain the rootfs hacks in v850?
I don't think we want those in mainline but rather generic
initrd/initramfs.
Also please remove arch/v850/sim/* - that stuff doesn't
belong into the kernel tree.

Why do you put set_page_refs into a header?  Separating it out
looks good to me, but IMHO it should stay in page_alloc.c.
BTW, are you sure that you don't need to set the refs in the
other caller of prep_new_page?  To me it looks like you should
and then you could merge it into prep_new_page.
Also, what is CONFIG_CONTIGUOUS_PAGE_ALLOC doing?  It seems not
fully implemented but adds lots of uglieness :)
CONFIG_NO_MMU_LARGE_ALLOCS might want a saner name, btw
(CONFIG_LARGE_ALLOCS?).
General commets:
- Config.in files have three-space, not two-space indentation
- I don't think you want to keep around the old binfmt_flat
  format when merghin into mainline
- MAX_SHARED_LIBS is never used
