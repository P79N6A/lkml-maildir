Anybody know where Donald Becker's atlantic.c program is??
I modified ne.c to recognize a (ZIATEC) card, the correct IRQ was
found, etc. Linux is perfectly happy.... but the board
doesn't send or receive anything. Probably the AUI isn't
turned on.
ZIATEC seems to have been gobbled up and I need to replace the
home-brew software in about 1000 systems with Linux.
Cheers,
