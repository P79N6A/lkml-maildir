btw., i have a patch against Linus' latest, -bk12 too:

yes. The kernel ELF loader now detects this PT_GNU_STACK program header
entry and acts upon it. (when using the setting of 1.)

it's quit easy to check: with a setting of 1, does 'cat /proc/self/maps'
show a randomized layout, while 'setarch i386 cat /proc/self/maps' shows a
regular layout? If /bin/cat defaults to exec-shield even with a setting of
1 then everything's recompiled.
in fact with glibc-2.3.2-92 and later ld.so will revert a non-executable
stack to executable if a binary loads a DSO that needs an executable
stack. 'tuxracer' is one such very important example :-)

i see the smiley - but it would truly be interesting to try to find the
boundaries of exec-shield and try to exploit it.
