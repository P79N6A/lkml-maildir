Ah yes, that is possible.  However at least for me I work against Linus' 
BK head, but my developmental NTFS tree is pulled by Andrew for -mm.  When 
I consider a release ready I request inclusion into Linus' tree.  For 
non-ntfs stuff I generally send to Andrew for -mm (like the loop driver 
fallback to file write patch I sent him a few days ago) and he can merge 
it into mainline later.
I imagine it is simillar for most maintainers trees.
Best regards,
