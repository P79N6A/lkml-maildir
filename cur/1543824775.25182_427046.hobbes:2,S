You are missing that both are the same camp.  It's just different paths 
to get to the same destination.  Common code will inevitably result.

That's an implementation detail that will naturally fall out of 
fbdev/DRM cooperation.  Don't worry, it will solve itself.

If the code is merged into the Linux kernel, X will follow.  Its axiomatic.
