For ISA not necessarily.  It could simply be told that it was there.
/etc/modules.conf or it's compile time equivalent.

I agree that ISA is a case.  I simply didn't see it.  And that was
my real point.  Usually we are pretty silent about most ISA devices in
dmesg, because of most of them are mandated by the PC architecture and
we just expect them to be there.

Given that nothing in the linux world reads kmem... 
Honestly you have two separate problems.
Problem 1:  How do you find out all of the hardware you have, as root.
Problem 2:  How do you get that information as non-root.
Please try solving these problems separately.
