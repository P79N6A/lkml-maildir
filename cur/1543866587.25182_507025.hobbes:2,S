Yes, nobody's been observing any problems arising from this, and if this
memory was really uninitialised, people would be hitting problems.
I don't want to have to require that all __attribute__((section)) storage
be initialised - people will surely forget to do it and things will slip
through.
If we really do have a problem here it'd be better to fix it in some
central and global fashion: either by ensuring that each architecture's
startup code will zero this memory or by some compiler/linker option such
as -fno-common.
