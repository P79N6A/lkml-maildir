I thought I had seen that bug. Module init function execution does not seem serialized enough, so the init function of one module seems to be able to be called in parallel with several other modules in turn being loaded, executing their init functions and even becoming live first class citizens.
Function sys_init_module in 
Linux 2.6.22.x and 2.6.23-rc4 kernel/module.c does not hold module_mutex when executing the init functions of the modules.
