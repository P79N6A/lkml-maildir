It is not that bad.  I tried starting firefox on a machine 20km away,
using a 5Mbps ADSL link from the "wrong" end.  (I ssh'ed into
my home pc from work.)
Firefox started in 55s, not 3min. Still bad, but that is a firefox
problem, not a generic X-tunneling problem.  I can start the
lyx word processor in 3s over the same link, and have decent
performance while using it too.
