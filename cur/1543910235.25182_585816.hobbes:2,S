"asm volatile" creates a side effect.  Side effects aren't
allowed to be reordered wrt sequence points.  This is exactly
the same reason as why "volatile accesses" cannot be reordered.

I did, yes.

There was (and is) nothing wrong about the "+m" documentation, if
that is what you are talking about.  It could be extended now, to
allow "+m" -- but that takes more than just "fixing" the documentation.
