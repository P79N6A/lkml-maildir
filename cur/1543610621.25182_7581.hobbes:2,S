After applying the patch, modprobing agpgart doesn't yield an oops 
anymore ; unfortunately :
# modprobe agpgart
/lib/modules/2.4.15-did/kernel/drivers/char/agp/agpgart.o: init_module: 
No such device
Hint: insmod errors can be caused by incorrect module parameters, 
including invalid IO or IRQ parameters
/lib/modules/2.4.15-did/kernel/drivers/char/agp/agpgart.o: insmod 
/lib/modules/2.4.15-did/kernel/drivers/char/agp/agpgart.o failed
/lib/modules/2.4.15-did/kernel/drivers/char/agp/agpgart.o: insmod 
agpgart failed
And in /var/log/messages :
Nov 24 22:57:49 localhost kernel: Linux agpgart interface v0.99 (c) Jeff 
Hartmann
Nov 24 22:57:49 localhost kernel: agpgart: Maximum main memory to use 
for agp memory: 439M
Nov 24 22:57:49 localhost kernel: agpgart: Detected an Intel 830M, but 
could not find the secondary device.
I don't have the slightest idea what the secondary device is supposed to 
be ; "modprobe radeon" loads the DRM radeon module without any problems 
whatsoever.
Kind regards,
Didier
