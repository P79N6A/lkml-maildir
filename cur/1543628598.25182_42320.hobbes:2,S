Hi there,
Are there any current projects to implement kernel-scheduled
entities (KSEs) on Linux?  They currently exist on FreeBSD, and
seem like a really neat idea.  I
The KSE research paper can be found at:
    
http://people.freebsd.org/~jasone/kse/
I think that KSEs are very similar to Scheduler Activations,
although they added support for threads which can be scheduled in
kernel-space as well as user-space.
