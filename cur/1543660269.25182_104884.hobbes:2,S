Hi,
1. You've forgotten the (stupid and cosmetic) bits in drm(s)
(drivers/char/drm/drm_agpsupport.h and friends)
2. Please insert your PCI id at the right place (ie keep pci ids
ordered)
See http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=103834293419740&w=2
for the full kt400 detection patch I did.
(Not that it won't work without all this, but being clean is not too
difficult)
Regards,
