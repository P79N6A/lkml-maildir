Actually, we should make MSDOS_PARTITION not ask at all, unless 
CONFIG_EMBEDDED is set. 
That's really what EMBEDDED means: ask about things that no sane person 
would leave out. So how about just changing that "if PARTITION_ADVANCED" 
into "if EMBEDDED" on MSDOS?
That way PARTITION_ADVANCED really _does_ mean "do you want some
additional choices", without implying that MSDOS would be advancedl. I
absolutely agree that everybody (regardless of architecture) wants msdos
partitions, if only because they are the defacto thing for things like
removable camera media etc.
