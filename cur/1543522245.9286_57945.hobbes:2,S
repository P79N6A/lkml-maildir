I hate error reports where people tell me "basically, ...".
Please show the verbatim output. (In the case of mke2fs omit
this list of block numbers.)
What commands do you give? Why do you think anything is wrong?
In the data you show here, all is perfect.
(Although I agree that 200 millibits is very little for a 700 meter filesystem.)

But what does it mean "returning the wrong value"?
Please tell what value it returns, and what value you would have preferred.

Since this letter does not show a single thing that is wrong,
it is difficult to guess what would repair the hypothetical problem.
