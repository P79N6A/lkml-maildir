Well, it seems I'm getting some very weird things happening with shared memory in 2.2
I might note this is just a recent thing.  It was happening in 2.2.15 as well as 2.2.16.  But in
any case what I am noticing is that everything is fine for some time, or condition, I don't really
know except after a while of running the system I get errors that programs can't allocate shared
memory.   shmget() seems to be returning an ENOSPC which to me seems odd.
For example I get this in apache logs:
[Tue Jul  4 21:34:11 2000] [emerg] (28)No space left on device: could not call shmget
Any other program trying to call shmget() gets this error after a notable period of uptime.  When
the system first starts up everything will start happily so it seems to be some sort of progressive
decay of shared memory availability (?). I have a decent amount of main system memory so I don't see
it running out of space *although* I am noticing that my shared memory allocation is rather high,
but I wouldn't think that would cause any drama:
        total:    used:    free:  shared: buffers:  cached:
Mem:  263041024 255148032  7892992 127479808  5873664 89694208
Swap: 139821056  1114112 138706944
MemTotal:    256876 kB
MemFree:       7708 kB
MemShared:   124492 kB
Buffers:       5736 kB
Cached:       87592 kB
SwapTotal:   136544 kB
SwapFree:    135456 kB
It seems strange to me the buffer memory would be that low seeing as I tend to run quite a lot of
applications on my machine but that is probably just my wandering imagination.
I had a brainstorm and thought that /proc/sys/kernel/shm* may be too low for my load.  To rule that
I put them to rather large values and I still get ENOSPC on shmget() calls:
sh-2.04# cat /proc/sys/kernel/shmmax && cat /proc/sys/kernel/shmall
201326592
4194304
(The second being a volatile value)
So that's why I'm writing .. I thought maybe there was something I was missing here :)
My kernel IS running the IDE 2.2.16 patch from hedrick and the lm-sensors / I2C 2.2.16 patch.  But
these I also don't see these causing any strife with my poor old kernel. Oh, and my kernel is SMP:
Linux version 2.2.16 (z@backdraft) (gcc version 2.95.2 20000313 (Debian GNU/Linux)) #11 SMP Thu Jun
