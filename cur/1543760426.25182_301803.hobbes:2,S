Ok, so Stephen's bug is already fixed.  After testing the latest bk, if
you find your bug isn't resolved, please try to isolate the change by
applying this patch.  If this doesn't resolve it, then your change of
behaviour hasn't been caused by changes to 8250.c, but must be down to
some other part of the kernel.
