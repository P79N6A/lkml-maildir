I use XFS on a number of production servers, and it has always served me well.
The only problem is of course getting a kernel that supports XFS. I'm glad many
of the more mainstream linux distributions are starting to have support for XFS
 support "out of the box", but I feel until it's in the mainline kernel many
people will never even have a chance to try it.
