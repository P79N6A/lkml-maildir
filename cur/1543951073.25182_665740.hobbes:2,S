==================== Changes in man-pages-2.79 ====================
New pages
---------
timerfd_create.2
    mtk, with input and review from Davide Libenzi
        Documents the timerfd_create(), timerfd_settime(), and
        timerfd_gettime() system calls, which are new in 2.6.25.
Changes to individual pages
---------------------------
syslog.2
    Jeremy Kerr
        Add info on command type 10.
        Add details on types 6, 7, 8, and 9.
        Minor grammar fix.
    mtk
        Update LOG_BUF_LEN details.
        Update RETURN VALUE section.
        Notes capability requirements under EPERM error.
        Minor fix to description of type==3 and type==4.
        Other minor edits.
proc.5
    Fernando Luis Vázquez Cao
        Update /proc/[number]/cmdline description.
        It used to be true that the command line arguments were
        not accessible when the process had been swapped out.
        In ancient kernels (circa 2.0.*) the problem was that the
        kernel relied on get_phys_addr to access the user space buffer,
        which stopped working as soon as the process was swapped out.
        Recent kernels use get_user_pages for the same purpose and thus
        they should not have that limitation.
epoll.7
    Davide Libenzi / mtk
        Clarify the somewhat unintuitive behavior that occurs if a file
        descriptor in an epoll set is closed while other file descriptors
        referring to the same underlying open file description remain
        open.
        See also 
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/596462/.
    mtk
        Clarify error that occurs if we add an epoll fd to its own set.
    mtk
        A few minor rewordings.
    mtk, after a note by Chris Heath
        Rework Q1/A1, describing what happens when adding the same
        file descriptor twice to an epoll set, and when adding duplicate
        file descriptors to the same epoll set.
    Heikki Orsila / mtk / Davide Libenzi
        Clarify Q9/A9 to discuss packet/token-oriented files.
    mtk, after comments by Devide Libenzi and Chris Heath
        Added Q0/A0, making explicit that the key for items in an epoll
        set is [file descriptor, open file description].
    mtk, after a note by Ron Burk
        Change A3, to note that when events are available,
        the epoll file descriptor will indicate as being readable.
    mtk
        Add some further explanation to Q5/A5 about why an epoll file
        descriptor cannot be passed across a Unix domain socket.
