A "death sentence" guarantee?  I like it. :)

I think of it as: "I will be allowed to use this many total pages, and
they are guaranteed not to fail."  (1), I think.  The sum of all of the
system's guarantees must be less than or equal to the amount of free
memory on the machine.  
If we knew to which NUMA node the memory was going to go, we might as
well take the pages out of the allocator.
