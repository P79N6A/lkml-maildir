Because is better lossign events then recording them delayed. In the
past we (LinuxPPS users) noticed that just postponing of one
instruction the timestamp recording degrade the timesetting of about
50%!

I averse not by default. :) But I just wish understand _why_ a
solution is better then other.
I'm sure my solution is not the best at all, but before changing it I
wish understand if the new proposal is better.

Mmm... I think this is not easy at all for sys_time_pps_fetch(). I
suppose you have to complicate its code a lot!
I don't undestand why we must complicate, and made unreadable, a code
in order to follow the rule use-only-one-lock-mechanism. If by using
mutex and spinlocks the code is more readable, where is the fault?

Ok, we can correct them. :)

Just for not delaying the IRQ handler. As already said, I prefere
loosing events that delaying their timestamps recording.

As already said we noticed that just delaying of one instruction the
timestamp recording the time setting degrades of about 50%.
We have to take care of this point. It's _very_ important that _each_
event had its timestamp recorded with delay as small as possible.

I think so. If not, why they pretend an _already opened_ filedes then
just a filename to be used as parameter for the open(2) syscall? :)
Again, it was simpler, and more logic, define the time_pps_create as
follow:
   time_pps_create(char *ppsdev, pps_handle_t *handle);
this definition resolves very well all possibile cases.

Ok, I'll wait for your modification to see how you can do it.

Ok, just what pps_findpath&C. does... however if you now how to
implement it I'll be very to see the code. :)
But, as you can see, this is due the bogus RFC specification. It was
more easier define the time_pps_create() as suggested above and you
didn't need no mapping at all.

Oh, yes... sorry, here the NTP main site:

No, I meant that if they require an already opened file descriptor is
beacuse they simply don't suppose that a PPS source may be totally
uncollerated to any device. If not they had two possibilities:
1) just using an open(2) to access a PPS source and using the returned
   filedes as PPS handler,
2) or, just to be more general, define the time_pps_create() as above,
   with the "char *ppsdevice" as parameter (then on UNIX systems we
   implement it with open(2)).

If you wish proving patches to LinuxPPS I just created a "develop"
branch into my GIT repository:
   
http://gitweb.enneenne.com/?p=linuxpps;a=shortlog;h=develop
Please, provide patch against that branch.
Thanks a lot, 
Rodolfo
