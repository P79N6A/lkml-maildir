This applies (or should apply...) to everything that goes to Linus in
his pre -rc1 merge windows.  To post -rc1 submissions and even more so
to -stable submissions, additional criteria apply.
However, there are special kernel trees out there which accept
backports.  Linux distributors do backports, because they have the means
to do so.

In the end there is but one solution to this:  Open specs.

Feature additions to SATA and networking, e.g. support of additional
hardware, are not backported to -stable or merged post -rc1 either, I
presume.  Maybe they are better in getting stuff ready in time before
merge windows open --- I don't know, I don't watch these subsystems.
Maybe they have less trouble with closed or nonexisting specs...?
