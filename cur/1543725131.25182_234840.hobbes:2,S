Dear friends:
Please excuse my ignorance: Does the indicated line below have any other 
purpose apart from making me comment it and recompile the kernel to get 
my soundcard working? ;-)
kernel-source-2.4.26/arch/i386/kernel/pci-pc.c
static void __devinit pci_fixup_piix4_acpi(struct pci_dev *d)
         /* PIIX4 ACPI device: hardwired IRQ9 */
  ===>   d->irq = 9;
$ isapnp /etc/isapnp.conf
/etc/isapnp.conf:167 -- Fatal - resource conflict allocating IRQ9
(see pci)
/etc/isapnp.conf:167 -- Fatal - Error occurred executing request
'IRQ 9' --- further action aborted
My soundcard is a Terratec EWS64 XL. I successfully use the 
sam9407-1.0.4 driver after a proper isapnp configuration, i.e. comment 
the hardwired IRQ9 line, compile the kernel, run isapnp.
If there should be really no other purpose I recommend to comment the 
line, so I can use a precompiled kernel from now on. :-)
kernel-source-2.4.26/arch/i386/kernel/pci-pc.c
static void __devinit pci_fixup_piix4_acpi(struct pci_dev *d)
         /* PIIX4 ACPI device: hardwired IRQ9 */
         /* d->irq = 9; */
Or maybe there is some method to deactivate hardwired irqs with boot 
parameters? My first experiments (without a clue about kernel internals) 
using kernel boot parameters like 'acpi=', 'pci=irqmask=0xMMMM' failed, 
though.
Please CC me, if you want me to read your reply asap.
All the best-
Torsten Scheck
