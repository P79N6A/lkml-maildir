 The patch works for the install test env.
 However I still have some concern on cond_resched_lock(), on an UP 
kernel it will return 1 if schedule happen, but actually it does not
drop any lock, that semantic seems to be different to SMP kernel. 
Though the only code I found that checks the return value of
cond_resched_lock is in checkpoint.c...
