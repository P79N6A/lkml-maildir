I am testing my driver for HP Fibre Channel HBA on RedHat Linux 6.0 (Linux
2.2.5-15) and encoutered a problem that I haven't been able to figure out
for a week.  Really hope someone can give me some help here.
The driver is currently running multi IO test (5 different file size) for 2
-3 hours, some times even longer.  The test is simple copy those five files
from IDE drive to first FC driver, then to second FC drive, then copy back
to ide drive and compare the result.  It is a loop test going forever or
until being killed.  However, system auto reboot after a period of time
(most likely 3 - 4 hours).  Occationally it stopped at Oops!
After system reboot, by checking the test log file, there is no data
corruption.  Since system reboot without any warning and sync, the error
message at the time of system decides to reboot was not logged in
/var/log/messages.   There is no trace can be found related to the error
that causes system reboot.
I have been used kdb for debugging this problem.  Unfortunately, it doesn't
always give me good clues.  Sometimes the system hung due to kdb itself.
But I do caught twice with kdb to stop when kernel touched NULL pointer.  At
that moment, checking all registers, trace and process, I only found
following functions are involved:
Out put:
Enter kdb due to panic @0xc01084e5 ASSED:88
eax: 0x00003400	ebx: 0xc025c000	ecx: 0xc1df2000	edx: 0xc025c000
esi: 0xc025c000	edi: 0xfffffc18	esp: 0xc1df2000	eip: 0xc01084e5
ebp: 0xc025ff58	ss:  0xc025c000	cs:  0x00000010	eflag: 0x00010282
ds:  0x00000018	es:  0x00000018	origeax: 0xffffffff
with stack trace command, found:
0xc01084e5	__switch_to + 0x31
0xc025c000	init_task_union
0xc1df2000	_end + 0x1b58178
I don't know how to figure out from above information that what is really
causing the panic.
I reload Linux without kdb again today and did some more test.  During the
same IO test today, I killed test and running command "ps -e".  Surprisely I
got similar panic as before.  After all test stopped, I ran "ps -e" twice
and both time system gives "Oops".  Following are the output of those Opps:
First time running "ps -e" during the test:

The system is still alive at this point.
Question:
Is the problem from kernel or from my driver?
How do I debug based on the Oops output?
Many thanks!
