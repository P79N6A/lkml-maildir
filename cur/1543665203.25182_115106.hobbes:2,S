   The problem is now the core networking has a dependency on the crypto
   hmac code (CONFIG_CRYOTPO_HMAC) since the ipv4 ipsec code was added to
   include/net/xfrm.h (which is included from all kinds of places.)
   The pretty much exhaust my networking/ipsec knowledge so no patch.
I'm fixing this.
