Subject: [PATCH] Fix x86-64 properly with MSI & Suresh's change
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/9/27/50

Together with Suresh's recent LH workaround: this patch makes x86-64 
compile again with MSI on.  i386 uses an CPU number, x86-64
an CPU mask for MSI_TARGET_CPUS and that didn't work very well.
I must admit I don't fully understand how MSI irq affinity
is supposed to work (why do you always redirect to the current CPU?),
but this matches i386 which is presumably the best tested MSI
platform.
