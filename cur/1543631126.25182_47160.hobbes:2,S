Well I need to do it.  I know all about ioctls and the like,
thank-you-very-much.  I am writing code for COMEDI (have you heard of this
driver suite?) which uses a kernel-space API for Realtime Linux
(RTAI/RT-Linux).  So yes, I NEED TO DO IT!  :)

Yes, as meantioned above.. my thread is permanent.  It is a periodic
realtime priority thread.  However, the stuff that needs to determine
device minors is going to run at non-realtime priority.
At any rate.. please don't chastise me.  I am asking a simple question and
I wanted a straightforward answer.. I didn't expect to be flamed for it.
Have a nice day, Dick.
