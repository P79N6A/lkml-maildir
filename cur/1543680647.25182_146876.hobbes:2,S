Yeah, I noticed. Writing low-level code without breaking strict aliasing
rules can be quite difficult if you don't want to give up any of your clever
tricks. I have a set of macros for handling linked lists that I can't get to
compile without those damn alias warnings with the latest GCC versions.
Besides, pushing our philosophycal discussion forward, what the generic
do_div() is doing might be vary bad for performance. After extracting the
address of n, the compiler must conservatively assume that any following
pointer dereference or function call could alter the contents of n.
Since strict aliasing is turned off, access to the divisor will become
slow as hell. Almost as if it was declared volatile.
Ok, as Richard said, it's just the generic version for those who don't
care enough to write their own optimized version.

 You beat me!
