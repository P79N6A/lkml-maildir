OK. I think I've finally managed to clean up the various interactions
with rpc_pipefs. I've uploaded a series of patches on the NFS client
website. See
  
http://client.linux-nfs.org/Linux-2.6.x/2.6.18-rc4/
The relevant patches are
linux-2.6.18-006-fix_rpc_unlink.dif: 
        From: Trond Myklebust <Trond.Myklebust@netapp.com>
        SUNRPC: make rpc_unlink() take a dentry argument instead of a
        path

linux-2.6.18-007-fix_rpc_rmdir.dif: 
        From: Trond Myklebust <Trond.Myklebust@netapp.com>
        NFS: clean up rpc_rmdir
        Make it take a dentry argument instead of a path

linux-2.6.18-008-fix_rpc_unlink_rmdir_2.dif: 
        From: Trond Myklebust <Trond.Myklebust@netapp.com>
        SUNRPC: rpc_unlink() must check for unhashed dentries
        A prior call to rpc_depopulate() by rpc_rmdir() on the parent
        directory may have already called simple_unlink() on this entry.
        Add the same check to rpc_rmdir(). Also remove a redundant call
        to rpc_close_pipes() in rpc_rmdir.

linux-2.6.18-009-fix_rpc_unlink_rmdir_3.dif: 
        From: Trond Myklebust <Trond.Myklebust@netapp.com>
        SUNRPC: Fix dentry refcounting issues with users of rpc_pipefs
        rpc_unlink() and rpc_rmdir() will dput the dentry reference for
        you.

----
In addition, there is one patch that is needed in order to fix up a
related issue in the function nfs_alloc_client(), which was introduced
by David Howells' NFS superblock sharing patches.
Cheers,
  Trond
