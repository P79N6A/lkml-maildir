You could try disabling NTP and running the python script I sent out
earlier in this thread to determine your systems ppm drift. Outside
+/-500ppm is def broken, outside of +/-250ppm is probably broken,
outside +/-100ppm isn't great but correctable and inside +/-100ppm is
(unfortunately) pretty average for most hardware.

Ok, do you want to open your own bug on this and we'll mark them
duplicate as needed?
Please attach dmesg output to the bug as well.
