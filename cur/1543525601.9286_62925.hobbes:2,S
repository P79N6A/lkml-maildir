I'm not saying it is a trivial problem.  The locking in IRIX isn't that bad, 
but it is impossible to give a figure on the number of locks because the 
number changes based on load on the various components.  I don't have an 
figure, and I'm not about to make one up off the top of my head.
My original point was that no vendor has sucessfully solved the problem of 
having a kernel that scales well and is light weight enough to work in 
embedded applications as well.  I think that is fairly well established by our 
discussion.  My original statement was to the effect of "striving to make 
Linux run well on embedded controllers as well as large CPU machines will pull 
it apart, because no one knows how to make an operating system that runs well 
in both scenarios".  This wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing, it could be a 
kinship somewhat like RT linux, but trying to integrate the two goals into the 
same code base seems like a cumbersome idea.

Because it isn't a trivial problem, and it is something that takes many 
man-years of work.

Yes, and it's not SMP.  Even the local nodes aren't SMP.  By SMP I am 
referring to UMA bus architectures, which the O2k is not.  For a UMA setup, it 
is way too easy to saturate the bus.  So before jumping to conclusions, it 
would have been nice to clarify terminology.  Looking at an Origin from a 
global view it might look symmetric, but looking at it from each node, it 
clearly is not.  Thus our differing use of SMP.

I didn't have time to read the papers, so I assumed you were making a case for 
small clusters being better.

No, I don't have numbers.  The theory:
First of all, I'm only considering the number of contended locks, not the 
number of locks taken.  Uncontended locks don't add much significant overhead 
other than possible cache effects.  It is easy to have a series of database 
requests that generate lots of contention in the database (I don't need to 
give examples do I?).  So I would imagine the number of contended locks would 
be able to reach the same order of magnitude.  Since contention has drastic 
latency and performance effects, it makes perfect sense to increase the 
granularity of the locks (in both the kernel and the database) to avoid it.
In any case, I think it is a good think for Linux to scale up past 8 cpus.  I 
wish that wouldn't hurt it's feasibility as a sleek embedded OS, but in 
reality, sleek embedded OSes are most likely going to be done on custom chips 
with custom bare bones kernels for absolute minimum latency and overhead.  
Thus I don't see Linux as being practical to run on an embedded disk 
controller.
That was my original point and I'm sick of going into off-topic tangents, so 
can we please stop the tirade or take it offline?
