Hi Alan,
can you may include the attached patch in one of the next pre19 patches?
It adds the possibility to work with pcmcia modem cards on PowerBooks,
this patch was in for a longer time in the ppc tree of Paul M. and Ben
Herrenschmidt. 
Ben told me to send it to you with his ack.
Thanks in advance,
Andreas[unhandled content-type:application/x-java-applet]
