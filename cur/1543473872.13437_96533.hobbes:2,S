If change hardware you have a good change of windows being unbootable as
well, as such configuring the BIOS to just leave the PnP devices
unconfigured works fine for %90 of the cases.

Use PCI then.

How can I best say this..
Shoot, I'm not even going to /TRY/ to communicate this to someone who
understands the internals so little as to suggest such a down right
/INSANE/ and /EXTREMELY DANGEROUS/ thing go into the kernel..
Please, go and read the archives, take special note of Linus's reaction
to ISA PnP support in the kernel..
