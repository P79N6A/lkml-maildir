Partial reads, not partial events.  Just like the previous code, it
returns to userspace after copying the events it found in the list
before it went empty.  It doesn't go back to sleep to fill the rest of
the buffer like a more classical blocking read() method would.
Where it differs is in what happens if you get errors copying events
after having successfully copied some.  The previous code would return
the error, that patch would return the bytes used by the good events.
