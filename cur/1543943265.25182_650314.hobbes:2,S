I tried manually applying the patch and added ||defined(__powerpc__), the above
build failure was resolved but it started failing at another place, 
  CC      kernel/printk.o
kernel/printk.c:568: error: expected ‘=’, ‘,’, ‘;’, ‘asm’ or ‘__attribute__’ before ‘static’
make[1]: *** [kernel/printk.o] Error 1
make: *** [kernel] Error 2
