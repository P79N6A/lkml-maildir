Is this inherent in the design, or could it be worked around? 
I'd certainly be more inclined to use coda if I could gradually introduce 
(test) it without having to convert my existing data partitions.
Is it possible to set up a coda server which serves existing 'real' 
filesystems? An extension to podfuk, perhaps? Or should we start on kcodad?
What were the original reasons for using its own filesystem? Does it require 
metadata/functionality that POSIX filesystems don't provide?
