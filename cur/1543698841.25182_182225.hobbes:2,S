I noticed something similar way back when, and what I took away from
the ensuing discussion (which may be complete poppycock) was:
  "IRQ balancing" means having individual IRQs run on the same CPU as
  much as possible, which (I assume) mitigates cacheline bouncing or
  something along those lines.  It does not mean having each IRQ
  serviced equally by each CPU.  The kernel's default policy is now to
  have all IRQs run on CPU0, with "noirqbalance"'s effect being to
  have the IRQs be serviced by CPUs in a round-robin fashion.
  noirqbalance is intended to be used when one is runing a userspace
  IRQ balancing policy daemon, such as the one written by Arjan Van de
  Ven (
http://people.redhat.com/arjanv/irqbalance/
).
