The fact of the matter is that we seriously abuse ioctl() to provide an
interface to configuring network devices.  You are supposed to have a
valid file descriptor to do an ioctl, but in the network config cases,
that fd doesn't have anything to do with the network device (look at the
special cases in net/*/af_*.c).  Thus our strategy of managing the
module refcount on open/close gets sidestepped.
Currently, the network devices have two states: registered, and open. 
Only in the open case is the module referenced.  What should be done is
add a third state in the middle, configured, which also holds a
reference.  Then the userspace configuration tools can explicitly
unconfigure the device in order to release the reference and unload the
module.
In the mean time, we could wrap refcount inc/dec around the calls to
dev->set_config() and dev->do_ioctl() in dev_ifsioc().  This fixes the
potential oops but still perpetuates the abuse of ioctl though.  I would
rather see a new syscall or a misc character device added to provide the
configuration interface.
