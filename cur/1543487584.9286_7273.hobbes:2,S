I am not sure we are talking about the same thing, but time_t is a 32bit
on i386. While xtime is a 64 bit (it has both time_t and the suseconds_t).
If I remeber well only movq (MMX) can move 64 bit at once on i386. But I
don't think the 64 bit thing is the issue.
I think the issue is timer_reg. What is timer_reg? To avoid a xtime_lock
we must make sure that the other CPU is not in the middle of the xtime
updating (so that only half of the xtime struct is been updated).
Van Jacobson is not enough to assure this (I am assuming that timer_reg is
something like `jiffies` on Linux).
