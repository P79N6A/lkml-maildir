How do you return an out of memory error to a C program that is out of memory
due to a stack growth fault. There is actually not a language construct for it

Eventually you have to kill something or the machine deadlocks. The oom killing
doesnt kick in until that point. So its up to you how you like your errors.
One of the things that we badly need to resurrect for 2.5 is the beancounter
work which would let you reasonably do things like guaranteed Oracle a certain
amount of the machine, or restrict all the untrusted users to a total of 200Mb
hard limit between them etc
