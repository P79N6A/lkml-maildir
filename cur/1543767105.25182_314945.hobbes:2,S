True, sort of.  Remember, the _only_ argument for (g)dlm being in-kernel is to 
tighten up the interface for filesystems.  If (g)dlm could be trimmed down by 
supporting _only_ in-kernel filesystems, with a different, userspace lock 
manager for user space apps, well, that is a strategy that has to be 
considered.
Taking part of (g)dlm out of kernel is also something that needs to be looked 
it.  It is a little on the biggish side.
Don't forget, (g)dlm is just a cluster service, and at present, a service that 
has exactly one user in the whole world: gfs.  We'd like to attract more, but 
not at the cost of kernel bloat.
Regards,
Daniel
