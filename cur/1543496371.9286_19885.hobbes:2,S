With version 2.2.6, I do not have long file remove times. If some
are having such a problem, it might have to do with their disk drives
and/or drivers. I have some SCSI disks and a BusLogic controller.

This shows that a 381,181,952 byte file was deleted in 4 seconds. That's
381,181,952/4 = 95,295,488  bytes/second.
Note that I synced the device after the copy. I think this shows that
the file-delete `problem` is a non-issue. 
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
