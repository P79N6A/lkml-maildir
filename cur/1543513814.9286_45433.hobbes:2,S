Side note: I never sent such binfmt_aout patch to Alan or to Linus. Just
check l-k.
The binfmt_aout patch I sent to Alan was a one liner (see l-k) for an
obvious bug and it had nothing to do with the binfmt_aout stuff that is
been merged into 2.2.13.
The patch I produced starting from the 2.3.x code - and that is been
merged in 2.2.13 - instead has a very good object that is to allow the old
binaries to run even on filesystmes with a blocksize > 1k.

I backported the messages from 2.3.x and I think the point of the messages
is exactly to remind to to the binary only people to produced ELF
binaries.
