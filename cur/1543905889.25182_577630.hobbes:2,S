Please stop embarrassing me (and yourself).
Sorry, I did lose my patience (others you mention did not) but then
that's precisely because of my own _less_ experience, if anything.
No, it's not like I "want to provide my solution for PPS support and
get it included into kernel tree" like you wrote above -- I simply
identified 4 problem areas in your implementation and wanted them to
be addressed. [If you can do so yourself, good enough, otherwise I'm
happy to send patch based on your earlier one too -- the modifications
I have in mind are few and simple.] I have no personal stake in this
PPS stuff anyway, this is just a normal peer review of submissions
that should always happen.
Thanks,
Satyam
