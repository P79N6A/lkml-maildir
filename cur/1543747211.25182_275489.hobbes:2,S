hmm strange, I would suggest to put a dump_stack here to see where it
triggers:
                               if (!pages[i] || PageReserved(pages[i])) {
                                       if (pages[i] != ZERO_PAGE(start)) {
+					       dump_stack()
                                               savevma = vma;
                                               goto bad_page;   
                                       }
                               } else
The only thing I see that's probably missing for sparc is a
flush_dcache_page page_cache_get, but that wouldn't prevent booting,
it'd only corrupt userland as worse (and it was missing from the
previous code too ;).
