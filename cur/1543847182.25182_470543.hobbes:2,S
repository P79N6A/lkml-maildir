Hi!

> 
> boot -> suspend -> (un)plug battery -> resume
> 
> The problem arises in both cases - i.e. suspend with battery plugged in, 
> and resume with battery unplugged, or vice versa.
> 
> After resume, when the battery status has changed (plugged in -> unplegged 
> or unplugged -> plugged in) during the time when the system was sleeping, 
> the /proc/acpi/battery/*/* is wrong (showing the state before suspend, not 
> the current state).
> 
> The following patch adds ->resume method to the ACPI battery handler, which
> has the only aim - to check whether the battery state has changed during sleep, 
> and if so, update the ACPI internal data structures, so that information 
> published through /proc/acpi/battery/*/* is correct even after suspend/resume
> cycle, during which the battery was removed/inserted.

> The patch is against current ACPI git tree, but applies cleanly also 
> against -mm and probably other trees. Please apply.

Looks okay to me.
