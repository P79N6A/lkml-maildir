I disagree.  We don't need to use a segment register to get the thread 
library equivalent of "current".  Changing the segment registers on a 
per process basis is a waste of time in the context switch.  Instead, 
making x86-64 TLS support based off of the stack pointer, or even using 
a fixed per-cpu segment register such that gs:0 holds the pointer to the 
thread "current" would be better.  Make the users of threads suffer, not 
every single application and syscall in the system.
