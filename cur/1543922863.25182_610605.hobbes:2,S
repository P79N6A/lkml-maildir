Global reserve means that any cpuset that runs out of memory may exhaust 
the global reserve and thereby impact the rest of the system. The 
emergencies that are currently localized to a subset of the system and 
may lead to the failure of a job may now become global and lead to the 
failure of all jobs running on it.
But Peter mentioned that he has some way of tracking the amount of memory 
used in a certain context (beancounter?) which would address the issue.
