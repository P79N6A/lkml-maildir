We don't initialize the free_area list for all zones. Instead,
free_area_init_core() does that only for zones which are non-empty.
But in __rmqueue(), we depend on these free_area lists to be intialized
correctly for all zones, which is not true in the present case we
are discussing.
I think we either need to initialize free_area lists for all zones
or check for !zone->free_area->nr_free in __rmqueue().
Even with this, mbind still needs to be fixed. Even though it
can't get a conforming zone in the node (MPOL_BIND case), right now,
it goes ahead with the "bind"ing of the memory area. This causes the
application to crash (assuming we have fixed the __rmqueue kernel crash)
(Haven't yet figured our why exactly the application dies)

Bharata.
