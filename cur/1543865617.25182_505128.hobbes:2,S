?! The whole point of memory barriers is that they affect other CPUs.
Maybe you are thinking of compiler barriers?

The proc_fops check *before* the atomic_inc is indeed pointless (notice
how I removed it in the patch I sent?).  It's the one after the atomic_inc
that prevents this race, but only if there is a memory barrier between the
atomic_inc and the check... because otherwise they could be reordered (i.e.
seen in reverse order by another CPU) giving the race.

As long as the module calls remove_proc_entry before being unloaded,
this should be ok.
Best wishes,
Duncan.
