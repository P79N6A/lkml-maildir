Yes I /do/. I want to wait for sufficient entropy. I count inter-IRQ
timing from network as a source of entropy. IE if the entropy pool
is exhausted, I'm prepared to, and desire to, block, until a few packets
have arrived. However, I do not wish to block indefinitely (actually
about 3 minutes as there's a little periodic block I/O) which is what
happens if I do not count network IRQ timing as an entropy source
(current /dev/random result, without Robert's patch, on most NICs).
Equally, I do not want want to read /dev/urandom (and not block)
which, in an absence of entropy, is (arguably) cryptographically weaker
(see below).

Well it's mostly doing SMTP/IMAP over SSL, and on port 25, yes.
Measuring it there at least 16 network IRQs for the minimum
SSL transaction. That generates 16x12 = 192 bits of
entropy (each IRQ contributes 12 bits). However, that's aside from the
2 to 3 packets a second of other stuff arriving on the server (unencrypted
port 25, ARP broadcast, VRRP, all the rest of the crap on the LAN).
It's a point worth making that I'm not talking about theory here. It's
there, tested, both ways, in a real environment. Opening an IMAP folder
over SSL stalls 3 times, for between 30 seconds and 3 minutes *EACH*
from an idle machine without Robert's patch (well I just patched eepro).
With the patch, no stalls > about 3 secs, which are far rarer (quite
acceptable).

You can't have your cake and eat it.
The point is simple: We say to authors of cryptographic applications
(ssl, ssh etc.) that they should use /dev/random, because /dev/urandom
is not cryptographically strong enough. Let's say I buy into this statement
(as if I don't, as one other poster has mentioned, we should just scrap
the blocking behaviour entirely). Well, I'd like /dev/random to be
functional in a headless environment. Perhaps not /quite/ as 'wonderful'
as it is in a non-headless environment, but better than /dev/urandom.
Saying 'well if you are writing a cryptographic application use should
use /dev/random, as this is the best source, but by the way, this means
your app will be dysfunctional on a headless machine, and we aren't
going to give you a config option to fix it' is the wrong approach
to OS design.

Would you accept that if you are actually counting CPU clock cycles, then
in practice, timing between network IRQs is, in a substantial number of
configurations, a non-externally observable property, without access or
equipment that would allow you to observe the innards of the machine too?
