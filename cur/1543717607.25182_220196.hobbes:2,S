Please don't do this.  It's messing all over sensitive codepathes in the
kernel, creating special cases and bloat of what you could with simple a
simpe hugetlb_mmap() wrapper ala (pseudocode)
hugetlb_mmap()
{
	fd = open(file in hugetlbfs)
	mmap(.., fd, ...)
	close(fd)
}
in some library.  The hugetlbfs implementation was chosen exactly because
if kept the impact of hugetlb pages down to normal kernel codepathes.
