I don't agree with that at all.  C is not better or worse than C++ in this
regard.  The only way to truly know what you get is to examine the generated
assembly code.  When I do this, more often than not I'm surprised at how the
compiler interpreted my code, or what code the compiler generated.  The only
time my C++ compiler generated code that I was wildly less efficient than I
expected was when I created an lookup table of member functions.  I had to
rewrite the code to use a switch/case statement instead.
