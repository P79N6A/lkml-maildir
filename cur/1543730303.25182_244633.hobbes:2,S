Here are a couple more traces in the ~200 - ~300 usec range:
http://www.cybsft.com/testresults/2.6.8.1-P7/2.6.8.1-P7-4.txt
http://www.cybsft.com/testresults/2.6.8.1-P7/2.6.8.1-P7-10.txt
Also, can someone tell me why I often see traces in the 4 ms range with 
  3 - 4 ms being reported by a single routine?
