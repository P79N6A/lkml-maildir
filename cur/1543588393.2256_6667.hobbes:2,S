Yeah. RGB->SVIDEO cabel has connected SDA-SCL together, so when it transmits
zero data bit, it will find clocks held in zero... Caller is i2c-matroxfb
procedure which calls i2c_add_bit_bus() ... It calls it with 1s timeout
too, but it is another story... I believed that it is 100ms timeout...

bit_test=1 should say 'DDC#2: SCL unexpected low while pulling SDA low!'...
