x86.git is out of the mainline tree, and it seems to be working fairly 
smoothly.  I've come to appreciate the "lots of small patches with quick 
turnaround" model that Ingo has been pushing.

Most of the activity is pure unification, with paravirt being part of 
that.  It doesn't help that it increases the CONFIG_ combinatorial 
explosion, but "make randconfig" shakes things out fairly quickly.

A big part of the rationale is to unify 32 and 64 bit, so that paravirt 
isn't a gratuitous difference between the two.  Also, 32 and 64 bit Xen 
have almost identical interface requirements, so the work is making 
64-bit Xen progress (and lguest64, of course).
