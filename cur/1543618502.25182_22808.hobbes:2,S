*** ANNOUNCEMENT *** LVM 1.0.2 available at www.sistina.com
Hi all,
LVM 1.0.2 supports both version 1 and 2 of the metadata.
There's *no* need to run any metadata update tools.
A tarball is available now at
   <
http://www.sistina.com/>
for download (Follow the "LVM 1.0" link).
This release contains minor changes to LVM 1.0.1 including:
o Linux 2.4.17 support
o sparc 64 fixes (tests needed!)
o persistent LV device minors to support client recovery after
  a NFS server reboot/failover
o ataraid device support
o support loop devices (they do not show up in /proc/partitions) 
See the CHANGELOG file contained in the tarball for further information.
Feed back LVM related information to <linux-lvm@sistina.com>.
Thanks a lot for your support of LVM.
