I think I would like to maintain one patch that is for
the recover kernel, and a second patch that is for the kernel
calling kexec.  So that we don't get things to confused.

I agree with this analysis for the panic path.

Hmm.  As my memory serves you can send a startup ipi anytime you
want so it may be reasonable to just ignore the other cpus
and wait until we get to trusted recovery code to do something
about them.  Though that implies reserved some memory below 1MB
which I'm not terribly fond of. 
I guess the place to start is the current implementation of
smp_send_stop, and we can see how the code goes from there.

For kexec without panic it keeps us from running on the bootstrap
processor, unless I missed something.

Good we agree on philosophy if not all of the little technical details.
