As I'm learning, this is complex.  Some DVD's, Alan says, have differing
udf and iso9660 filesystems for copy protection reasons.  They spoof windows
into not allowing easy access to some files.  Maybe your VCD issue is similar.
Try mounting the disc both ways (udf and iso9660) and compare the filesystems.
I'm told windows prefers udf to iso9660.  Linux does it the other way 'round.
Thus a disc that works perfectly on Windows shows zero files on Linux
(confusing users and sysadmins alike, since prior to today, the man pages
for mount and fstab were silent on the issue).

PS: Thanks for being the first person to also think users should not have
to know about the udf vs. iso9660 issue.
It looks like util-linux, mount is the place to fix this:
