James,
 Whats the current status with matroxfb ? Its been broken
for months now, and hasn't seen any progress wrt getting it
back on its feet.
I understand Petr had some concerns with the new API, but
*something* needs to be done to get this back up and running.
I'd understand if this was a neglected hardly-used-by-anyone
driver, but there's an awful lot of matrox cards out there.
This was first reported broken way back in 2.5.53, but I believe
was broken even longer before that.
