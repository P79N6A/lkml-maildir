2.5.36 works fine on this machine.
2.5.39 UP don't boot at all. I get a black screen
and hanging machine right after lilo, no messages
at all from the kernel trying to boot.
Any ideas about what can go wrong so early?
I tried make mrproper and recompiling, it
made no difference.
The machine is a PII with 256M RAM and a intel 440
chipset.
