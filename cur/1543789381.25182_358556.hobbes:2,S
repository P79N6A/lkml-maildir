We call it "low" memory because it happens to have "low" addresses. In 
other words, it's not "terminology", it's "English".
None of the allocators that allocate stuff in ZONE_NORMAL is called "low" 
normally. It's _normal_ memory. It's not ZONE_LOW. 
We don't say "kmalloc_low()". We say "kmalloc()". 
A function that is called "xyz_low()" means something else than normal to 
me. If it was normal memory, we'd call it just "xyz()". And if it did high 
memory, we'd call it "xyz_highmem()" (or, preferably, we'd just have a 
generic function that accepted GFP_HIGHMEM as a parameter).
