Yes. ACPI spec says transitions can fail. But, it doesn't fail often in 
practise. And even if it fails, I think, we should handle it without this 
read os STATUS register. The speedstep-centrino driver, which does similar
thing as acpi-cpufreq, does not do this status check after control MSR write.
We can skip the read of STATUS in cpi-cpufreq in a similar way. No?
I feel the overhead of doing the status read here is too high. As it uses SMM,
the latency for read of STATUS is almost same as write into CONTROL. If we 
think retaining the STATUS read is better, we should atleast double the 
transition time reported in _PSS to compensate for this extra overhead.
And reading the STATUS in a loop should go away. I don't see that it being 
mentioned in ACPI spec. The 1mS loop seems totally redundant.
Thanks,
Venki
