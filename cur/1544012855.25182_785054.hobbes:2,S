Subject: [PATCH] mm: kswapd stop infinite loop at high order allocation
Wassim Dagash reported following kswapd infinite loop problem.
  kswapd runs in some infinite loop trying to swap until order 10 of zone
  highmem is OK, While zone higmem (as I understand) has nothing to do
  with contiguous memory (cause there is no 1-1 mapping) which means
  kswapd will continue to try to balance order 10 of zone highmem
  forever (or until someone release a very large chunk of highmem).
He proposed remove contenious checking on highmem at all.
However hugepage on highmem need contenious highmem page.
To add infinite loop stopper is simple and good.
