Yeah, I think you are correct.  But I don't see where in the debugfs
code I messed this up...
In debugfs_mkdir() we increment the parent i_nlink properly if we create
the new subdirectory, and based on other implementations like this
(usbfs), that logic seems to be correct.
Unless something is odd with creating a directory in the root of the fs.
Does the subdirectory you have created have the proper number of links?

Hm, newer versions of find don't complain about this?
