It's a bug with nested menus.  It has been there since the first version
of xconfig.  It will be gone in one or two more releases.
You can try the new code if you want.  Remove this line:
    /* scripts/tkparse.h */
    #define BUG_COMPATIBLE
You might wonder why this line even exists.  The answer is that I rewrote
tkparse in pre7-ac5.  The BUG_COMPATIBLE path is well tested, including
a complete all-architecture regression test.  The code in the other path
is tested only on my machine so far.
