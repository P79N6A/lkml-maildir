The MSI 6321 motherboard *doesn't* *have* an option to run the chipset in
"normal" ATA/100 mode, that's the problem.
Andre didn't really answer my question so, to re-phrase - can the 20265
on these boards be set up as a "normal" 2-port ATA/100 controller in software.
The BIOS only enables one port - the second port's "enable bit" is showing
that it is disabled. There is _no_ BIOS option to run it in non-RAID mode
and no jumpers on the board to do so either.
If it can, then I'll happily write the code myself and maintain a local patch
if needs be but I need to know what bits to poke out of what port and in what
order. If it can't be done at least I'll _know_ that it can't be done.
I've already tried the MSI support mail address and been met with stunning
silence.
