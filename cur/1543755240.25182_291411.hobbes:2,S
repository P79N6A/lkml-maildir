Looks like it is only specified for this case.
"The scope of this document is limited to direct application of the 
 LRW-AES transform to encrypt or decrypt data at rest, when this data 
 consists of an integral number of wide blocks."
Where "wide blocks" means "512 consecutive bytes".
In any case, LRW should be made configurable and marked experimental.
