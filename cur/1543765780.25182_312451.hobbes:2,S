Its a standard API

Really, you will spotaneously magically make them appear in old kernels
that end users have just like that ?
Your argument doesn't hold water. Its an API for drivers so that people
can add 85x30 card drivers using DMA in this fashion. Its an API so they
can add them to *EXISTING* kernels without users being forced to
recompile/wait for the vendor to update their tree/upgrade to a new
release.
