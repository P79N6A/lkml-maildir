Caught a few:
drivers/char/tty_io.c: In function `tty_check_change':
drivers/char/tty_io.c:332: structure has no member named `pgrp'
drivers/char/tty_io.c:334: structure has no member named `pgrp'
	if (is_orphaned_pgrp(current->pgrp))
		return -EIO;
	(void) kill_pg(current->pgrp,SIGTTOU,1);
should these be converted?
drivers/char/tty_io.c: In function `tty_open':
drivers/char/tty_io.c:1409: structure has no member named `pgrp'
		tty->pgrp = current->pgrp;
this one?
drivers/char/tty_io.c: In function `tiocsctty':
drivers/char/tty_io.c:1583: structure has no member named `pgrp'
        tty->pgrp = current->pgrp;
and this.  I think so?
