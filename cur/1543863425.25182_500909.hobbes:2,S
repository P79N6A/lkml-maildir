Perhaps the most visible change is that -no-acpi is no longer required 
to install Windows (it is still recommended as the Windows ACPI HAL will 
eat a lot of cpu time).
Changes from kvm-11:
- More migration work (Uri Lublin)
- savevm/loadvm (and migration) work on AMD (Leonard Norrgard)
- More guest support
- mmu testsuite and fixes
- Windows ACPI install/run support (Dor Laor)
- Fix host reboot on guest reboot on AMD (Joerg Roedel)
