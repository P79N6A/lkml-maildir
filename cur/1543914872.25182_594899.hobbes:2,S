The v2 was maybe more intuitive, but had at least one flaw, where it claimed
the option was selected by another, while it was in fact only made
unchangeable by 'bool "Enable block layer" if EMBEDDED', defaulting to y.

Where exactly does this happen? There are cases when maximum < minimum, for
example when you <M> THINKPAD_ACPI, then <N> BACKLIGHT_LCD_SUPPORT. After that,
BACKLIGHT_CLASS_DEVICE has minimum of 1 (selected by THINKPAD_ACPI) and maximum
0 (depends on BACKLIGHT_LCD_SUPPORT, which is n)
The function names are maybe suboptimal, I agree.

Try saying <M> to MAC80211, wireless extensions were -*- with v2, now are (*) with v3.
Also the symbols ( ), { } are changed and more well-defined in v3 IMHO.
