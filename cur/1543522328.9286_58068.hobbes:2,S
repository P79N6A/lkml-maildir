Subject: [PATCH] Generic AVL-Trees
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2000/1/17/54

As of kernel 2.3.37 there are three separate AVL Tree implementations.
Included is a patch which implements generic AVL-Trees (ala linux/list.h)
and converts the existing code to use the new mechanisms.
The existing uses of AVL Trees are in:
linux/mm/mmap_tree.c
linux/net/bridge/br_tree.c
linux/net/ipv4/inetpeer.c
The attached patch is in gzip form, alternatively it may be obtained from:
http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~koconnor/kernel-avl-patch-1.1c
The patch is against 2.3.39, but since these files rarely change, it will
probably also apply to previous and/or later versions.
Comments?
