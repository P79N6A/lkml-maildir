Nope, there are BIOS INT19 hooks that have some voodoo.
Until the driver can open and read the BIOS on the HBA, no can do.

LOL, LinuxBIOS can not even get POST on execute diagnostics correct.
It violently nukes the state machine requirements of a 31 seconds.
This is another war and I really do not give a damn to fight, when nobody
listens or bothers to read the freaking spec.  Anybody got a copy of the
Phoenix BIOS book to see how the old hats did it?

Sure kill all the legacy stuff and split the driver.
If you are wanking so hard on the setup, take and export all the setup to
their respective modules (ie hba's).  As for the static structs, I pushed
to have dynamic major/minor allocations but got dive bombed with a flock
of sea gulls.

I just love how everyone thinks it is so easy, how I made such a freaking
mess of the driver.  Well you all can dork with it and I will wander off
and intergrate the chipset cores.  The only reason it is even close to
becoming clean is because the core transport layer for the state machine
was ripped appart and started from the ground up.
Hell, just ask and I will turn the whole transport into as SCSI wrapper
and we can root wad the directory.
