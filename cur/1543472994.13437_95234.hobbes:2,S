One might as well also say that the whole system should be called 
"GNU/X/Linux"; the X Window system contribution, in terms of number of 
lines of code of software, is very large. People should remember that 
not only "hackers" contributed, but a number of major companies, including 
my own, contributed large amounts to that code base, under fully free 
terms (where the UNIX vendors went wrong was stuff built on top, and the 
silly GUI wars of the beginning of the decade).  In terms of total effort 
and number of lines of code, both GNU and X represent much larger efforts 
than the base operating system.
But the reality is that this is too cumbersome, whether you say "GNU/Linux" 
or "GNU/X/Linux.  The market and men on the street now associates "Linux" 
with the whole combination, for better or for worse.  I'm personally very 
gratified that our (in this case, the X Window system community, GNU 
community, and Linux community) are affecting a large and growing number 
of people, rather than withering and dying from the effects of Redmond.
So long as Linus gives credit where credit is due to the various groups
that make up this community, there is little to be gained (and arguably,
much to be lost) by confusing people with a more complex nomencature.
Obviously, when writing for a technical audience, (rather than the mass
audience), being more clear what you mean may make sense and give credit
where credit is due.  But lets not confuse the mass market, which
has enough trouble understanding Linux as it is.
