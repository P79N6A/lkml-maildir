Oh, no doubt you can do it. The SOFTRR thing can be fixed for this, pretty
easily. The problem, like Alan is saying, is that with the current
scheduler you do not need SOFTRR to starve other tasks. This is why I said
that all the issues that have been grought up in the last few months
should be discussed before going in 2.6. So that we can either say that
are corner cases that we can ive ith, or we fix them. I didn't follow the
scheduler after the first merge but it seems that a couple of issues
should be addressed before 2.6.
