Hmm, that may lead to uneven balancing because the counter is 
per thread. But if it works for you it's ok I guess.
I still think changing the callers and use the offset for
static interleaving would be better. Maybe that could be
done as a followon patch.

Ok.  If that gets in I would suggest you also document it 
in the manpages and send me a patch.
