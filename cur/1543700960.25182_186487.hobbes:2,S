[oracle9i listener crashing]
Run memtest on your computer. If you do not see any error (ECC support is
enabled in your hardware setup, is not it ?), ask oracle to fix the bug.
Segfault in chunk_free() _usually_ means double free/use after free or so.
So far, this does not really look like a kernel related problem.
