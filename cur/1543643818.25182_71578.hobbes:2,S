Hi All,
I have to build NTP server on an embedded pc.
Which processors/boards are suitable for this.
Such processor/board cannot have ANY problems with time handling.
I thought about Geode (NS), but I found some info that it doesn't have
TSC, or it works not properly (the PPS needs TSC). 
And of course has to work excellent with linux.
Please CC me, as I'm not subscribed.
Best Regards,
