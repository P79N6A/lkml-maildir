Problem is the same than ever.  Full major kernel releases take 2
years.  That means that we need to force things in the _stable_ branch
that should be in next branch.  2.4 should be in maintenance mode (aka
something similar to what happens in 2.2 just now), but as 2.6 is not
ready (and will not in at least several months yet), we have to live
with big changes like the big IDE merge.
About the reasons for having lots of patches in a vendor kernel.  It
is just a pain in the ass :(  I completely agree with Arjan on that.
Problem is that getting patches back merged upstream sometimes is not
easy either :(  For instance, users test the distro when they are in
release candidate, and when you found that problems and you got fixes
for that, it is posible that kernel code base has already changed,
what makes merging your fixes difficult.  And not, merging code for
mainline during a release candidate cycle is Just a Bad Idea (tm).

Will be basically the same work.  Somebody needs to be in charge of
that branch.  And if you get <somebody> to pass your changes, then you
have also the same posibilities to pass the patch Marcelo :)

Here, I completely agree with Pavel, you should never tell that
sentence in that list :)  You should use a vendor kernel only if:
- you don't know how to compile your own, and you are not interested
  in learn how to do it.
- you are lazy, and think that it is _easier_ for you to use a vendor
  kernel.
