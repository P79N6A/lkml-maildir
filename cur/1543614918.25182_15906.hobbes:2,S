Clamour.
The current system has some significant problems.  Pet peeves:
- Failure to rebuild the right things after you've applied a patch
- Doesn't work when the same tree is accessed via different paths
  (make dep on local machine, build across nfs)
- Mysterious recompilation of things which you've already compiled.

An optimisation of one bit, Keith says.  I'd guess that his two-week
estimate is optimistic because he'll have a busy two weeks supporting
the patch once it goes in, but whatever.

Keith says it speeds up builds where only a small number of files
have changed.  For me, that's the common case.
I'd like to hear more from Keith on where this 100% actually occurs,
but if he says it's fixable in a (give him four) week timeframe,
I believe him.
As you know, I'd be more concerned about moves to drop support
for the older and much faster gcc versions.  If you're not using
egcs-1.1.2, you're already a very patient person.
