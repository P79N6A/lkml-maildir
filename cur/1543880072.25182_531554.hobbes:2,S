I used the word relatively loosely. Nothing extreme is going on.
Maybe the phrasing exaggerated the force of the opinion. I'm sorry
about having misspoke so.

Al Boldi's testcase appears to reveal some issues. I'm plotting a
testcase of my own if I can ever get past responding to email.

I expect that whether a scheduler can handle such prioritization has a
rather strong predictive quality regarding whether it can handle, say,
CKRM controls. I remain convinced that there should be some target
behavior and that some attempt should be made to achieve it. I don't
think any particular behavior is best, just that the behavior should
be well-defined.

It's not so far out. Basically just changing the key calculation in a
relatively simple manner should get things into relatively good shape.
It can, of course, be done other ways (I did it a rather different way
in vdls, though that method is not likely to be considered desirable).
I can't really write a testcase for such loose semantics, so the above
description is useless to me. These squishy sorts of definitions of
semantics are also uninformative to users, who, I would argue, do have
some interest in what nice levels mean. There have been at least a small
number of concerns about the strength of nice levels, and it would
reveal issues surrounding that area earlier if there were an objective
one could test to see if it were achieved.
It's furthermore a user-visible change in system call semantics we
should be more careful about changing out from beneath users.
So I see a lot of good reasons to pin down nice numbers. Incompleteness
is not a particularly mortal sin, but the proliferation of competing
schedulers is creating a need for standards, and that's what I'm really
on about.

I could say "percent cpu" if it sounds less like formal jargon, which
"CPU bandwidth utilization" isn't really.

It wasn't meant to be quite as strong a statement as it came out.
Sorry about that.

I've made no such claims. Also rest assured that the tone of the
critique is not hostile, and wasn't meant to sound that way.
Also, given the general comments it appears clear that some statistical
metric of deviation from the intended behavior furthermore qualified by
timescale is necessary, so this appears to be headed toward a sort of
performance metric as opposed to a pass/fail test anyway. However, to
even measure this at all, some statement of intention is required. I'd
prefer that there be a Linux-standard semantics for nice so results are
more directly comparable and so that users also get similar nice
behavior from the scheduler as it varies over time and possibly
implementations if users should care to switch them out with some
scheduler patch or other.
