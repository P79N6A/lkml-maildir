	Geee... Is that a problem? I've seeing 0k shrd in a 486DX2
	since 2.3.16 here. I thought it was extremely strange, but for
	some reason I didn't report.
	And this happens with 2.3.1[678], which were the first
	versions I tried on that 486.
	I also see that 2.3.x is *MUCH* more memory hungry than 2.2.12
	(for instance) regarding memory on a 8MB machine (this 486).
	I can give much details if anybody wants me to.
	[]s, Roger...
