Oops, no, sorry. It was buggy code that previously seemed to work.
Buggy code:
	pthread_mutex_lock(&slots_mutex);
		while (slots<=0)
			pthread_cond_wait(&slots_cond,&slots_mutex);
		slots--;
		items++;
	pthread_mutex_unlock(&slots_mutex);
	pthread_mutex_lock(&items_mutex);
		pthread_cond_signal(&items_cond);
	pthread_mutex_unlock(&items_mutex);
(buggy because it acceses items without locking. The same in the other
endpoint of the queue).
Correct code:
	pthread_mutex_lock(&slots_mutex);
		while (slots<=0)
			pthread_cond_wait(&slots_cond,&slots_mutex);
		slots--;
	pthread_mutex_unlock(&slots_mutex);
	pthread_mutex_lock(&items_mutex);
		items++;
		pthread_cond_signal(&items_cond);
	pthread_mutex_unlock(&items_mutex);
So don't worry. I was so busy I forgot to post the solution.
