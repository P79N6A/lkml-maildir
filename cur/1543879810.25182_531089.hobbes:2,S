We need to think very carefully here.
charge, current, capacity, etc. are properties all batteries have, and
the current values can all be sampled instantaneously.
funky values processed by 'black box' firmware are not universal
properties of all batteries.
IOW, battery class should be for 'simple' battery types only.
perhaps rename it to simple battery class to make it distinct?
Userspace is the place to put the complications, in any case, and I see
nothing wrong with having both a simple battery class AND other
proprietary battery class an SBS battery class. (or a
toshiba_proprietary_bios battery class or whatever).
Perhaps we need a 'libbattery.so' so that userspace can have a nice
consistent interface?
