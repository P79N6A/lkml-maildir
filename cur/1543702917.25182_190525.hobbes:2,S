I've seen slow machine (386sx with ne1000) that could not receive 7 full-sized packets
back-to-back. You are sending 22 full packets back-to-back.
I'd expect some of them to be (almost deterministicaly) lost,
and no progress ever made.
In same scenario, TCP detects "congestion" and works mostly okay.
On ne1000 machine, TCP was still able to do 200KB/sec on
10Mbps network. Check if your slow machines are seeing all the packets you
send.
