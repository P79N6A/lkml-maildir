I imagined it would check for 
+struct file_operations ... = { 
+      ...
+	.ioctl = ...
That wouldn't catch the case of someone adding only .ioctl to an 
already existing file_operations which is not visible in the patch context, 
but that should be hopefully rare. The more common case is adding
completely new operations

That's probably a bug in general. e.g. those likely won't work 
at all on the "compat by default" architectures like sparc or ppc64.
