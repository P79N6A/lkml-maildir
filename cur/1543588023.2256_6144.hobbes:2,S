Subject: [PATCH] IP forwarded checksum, kernel 2.2.18-19

Hi there!
I realized that some tests were failing due to dropped IP packets. I
traced and discovered the following:
--------Begin patch
# This caused some "holes" in forwarded transfers, that is checksum was
bad
# on some occasions -MG
diff -ur original/include/net/ip.h mpc8xx-2.2.18/include/net/ip.h

 int ip_decrease_ttl(struct iphdr *iph)
 {
-       u16 check = iph->check;
+       u32 check = iph->check;
        check += __constant_htons(0x0100);
        iph->check = check + (check>=0xFFFF);
        return --iph->ttl;
------------End patch
The expression check>=0xFFFF could only be true(1) when (u16)check ==
0xFFFF, not what is it meant to be.
This is fixed exactly like this patch in 2.4.x.
Kernel 2.2.19 also has the same problems.
Thanks,
