It's not so much about what is connected to the devices, as what is
actually going on in the asic on the board. If something were faulty, or
slightly more sensetive than it should be(too high a tolerance), then
you could get this affect. Changing your mixer parameters might show you
the light, er um...let you hear the difference and see if it gets worse
or not. Another thing you could also do, is move the sblive card to a
different slot, if not yet tried. If in too close proximity to the NIC,
it *could* cause this behaviour as well.
