dmasound_pmac is crippled with bugs too... We should look at reported
bug reports on snd-powermac (and snd-aoa which replaces the later for
recent machines) and kill dmasound-pmac. I'm ok with that. snd-aoa is
the only one to be properly maintained anyway, we'll add support for
older machines to it over time and hopefully, it's a much saner codebase
in the first place so handling weird machines regressions will be
easier.
Ben.
