Sorry, I missed the point at issue here, and what changed when.
Assuming (perhaps wrongly) it's independent of filesystem type,
Solaris         yes             ok              ok
HP-UX           yes             EROFS           ok
I don't have UnixWare or OpenServer at hand to test,
guess UnixWare as Solaris, can report OpenServer tomorrow.
But it looks like a Floridan answer.
