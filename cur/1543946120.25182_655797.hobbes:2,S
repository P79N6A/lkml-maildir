I believe that one's been dropped as it's not needed if we don't use 
MMCONFIG for non-extended accesses (like we use during BAR sizing). 
(Though, there may still be a case where it's needed, see below.)

The only issue on those boards is that since certain device BARs will 
overlap the MMCONFIG area during BAR sizing, if you use MMCONFIG to do 
the accesses used during BAR sizing itself, it'll fail. If you use conf1 
to do the BAR sizing then that problem doesn't happen.
However, I suppose there could be an issue if you hotplugged a device 
(causing BAR sizing) once you'd booted, while extended config space was 
in use on another device. The BAR sizing wouldn't fail, but the guy 
using extended config space would since he's actually reading 
from/writing into the BAR of the device being sized instead of the 
MMCONFIG area. That wouldn't be good. The disable-decode-during-sizing 
patch would avoid that problem.
