Subject: [patch 0/8] Immediate Values (now with merged x86 support)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Hi Andrew,
Here is the latest version of the Immediate Values. It supports x86 as a single
architecture. I also removed the *_early API which could have been confusing to
developers : choosing the right algorithm is now done internally by keeping
track of where we are in the kernel boot process.
The patchset depends on :
"Instrumentation menu removal"
and
"Text Edit Lock".
It is based on 2.6.24-rc2-git3 and applies in this order :
#Immediate Values
#for -mm
immediate-values-architecture-independent-code.patch
immediate-values-kconfig-embedded.patch
immediate-values-move-kprobes-x86-restore-interrupt-to-kdebug-h.patch
add-asm-compat-to-x86.patch
immediate-values-x86-optimization.patch
immediate-values-powerpc-optimization.patch
