A distant possibility might be that your card is a very specific rare revision
of that thing and thus doesn't have a proper card type entry for it due to
almost nobody else having that card.
In the TV card area (just as in the WLAN card area) there are quite some cards
sold under the *very same* name but wildly (or not so wildly but sufficiently)
differing hardware (those manufacturer b****rds burn in hell please, thanks).

I'm not that familiar with ALSA user-space interface specifics (rather than
kernel-level), sorry.
