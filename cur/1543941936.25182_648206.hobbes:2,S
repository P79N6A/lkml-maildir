I was not claiming anything.  The thing is that I have seen people using
code as schematized in the first code example.  And the point of this
patch is to make the placing of string literals in disposable sections -
which is already done - more convenient.
Using code as in the first example is just ugly.  My approach is to make
it less ugly.  But after all, it was not my idea to move the string
literals.
drivers/net/3c505.c does it, grep for notfound_msg for an in-tree
example.
You were asking me my own question.  I placed an `RFC' in the Subject:
because I am interested in your (and others) view on this topic.
I will convert some of the code to use the macros I introduced and look
if it gains some significant size improvements on a common desktop
configuration as I have it on my laptop.
