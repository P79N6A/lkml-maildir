Ok, let's try without preempt. Under the kernel config make sure you
select the following:
kernel hacking => kernel debugging => magic sysrq key
Also increase the kernel log buffer at, set it to 17 just to be safe
general setup => kernel log buffer size
Do what you do so that the processes become unkillable, then press 
AltGr+SysRq+t  2-3 times and send the dmesg over here.
(sysrq normally being on the same key as 'print screen', at least on my
keyboards).
This should tell us what is going on.
Thanks!
