Jan, all of it is duable: we can downgrade the f/s to readonly, grab various
locks, search through various lists looking for open fd's and such, then
decide if to allow the mount or not.  And hopefully all of that can be done
in a non-racy manner.  But it feels just rather hacky and ugly to me.  If
this community will endorse such a solution, we'll be happy to develop it.
But right now my impression is that if we posted such patches today, some
people will have to wipe the vomit off of their monitors... :-)
Seriously, can someone suggest a step-by-step procedure to handling this
issue, maybe even sprinkle some pseudo code there?  Is there a procedure
that is clean and acceptable to all?  We'd love to hear it.
