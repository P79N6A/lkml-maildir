I got every crash under X so far (but I run X all the time so I can't
tell if it is related to X or not).
The crash doesn't happen when X starts, it happens at RANDOM times,
without any particular workload. Now it's some days that I don't see
the crash (from when I updated to 2.6.14-rc5-gd475f3f4)... so five days
without crash. I'm waiting to see if it happens again.
The last kernel that crashed was 2.6.14-rc5-g93918e9a.
I don't remember to have seen this crash with 2.6.13... so I suppose
2.6.13 is OK.

No.
	$ grep "AGP Fast" /var/log/Xorg.0.log
	(II) RADEON(0): AGP Fast Write disabled by default
I have other issues with AGP Fast Write: if it is DISABLED in BIOS I
can enable it in Xorg config without problems. If it's enabled in BIOS
and I enable it in Xorg config I get this:
	when X starts the screen goes in SUSPEND mode and X eats all
	the CPU (I've seen this whith ssh). X is unkillable and I
	cannot debug it with gdb... only a reboot kills it! But this is
	another issue.
The current AGP Fast Write config is:
	- enabled in BIOS	(don't ask me why...)
	- disabled in xorg.conf
