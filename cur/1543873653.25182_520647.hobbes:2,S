I think Andi and Andrew have boxes which are afflicted.

Yeah, fair enough.  But as Eric likes to keep pointing out, an
executable ELF file need not have any sections at all, so the only safe
course for anything "real" is via the section headers.
So I guess the right thing to do is relocate the dynamic stuff via
PT_DYNAMIC, and relocate the symtab if its present.

No, I was just complaining about the embedded assignment, before dinner,
so I was overly terse.
