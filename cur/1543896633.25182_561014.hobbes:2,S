I think it's wrong. Look, when the container hits the limit and just
unmaps the pages the following situation may occur: some *other* container
will hit the global shortage and will have to wait till the other's
pages are flushed to disk. This is not a true isolation. If we send the
pages to the disk right when the container hits the limit we spend its
time, its IO bandwidth, etc and allow for others to have the free set of
pages without additional efforts.

Peter, could you prepare some POC patches instead? See, when looking at
the patches is simpler to understand what is going on then when reading
the plain text. Moreover, when making the patches some unexpected details 
of the kernel internals arise and the ideas begin to change...
