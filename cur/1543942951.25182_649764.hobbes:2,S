Your last sentence, above: That is what EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL attempts to
do.  The place to state such a requirement is in the licence, not in the
source code.  That is what I am talking about.  I can't provide you with
software under a licence that says, "you are free to use this software
in any way you want," and later say, "oh, but in the source code is
tells you that you must take a break every two hours of use."

I don't, but EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL doesn't do that.  It makes an ambit
claim, that might coerce an author into making a driver GPL, but might
also cause them to exit the Linux market.  I have a problem with driving
manufacturers away from Linux.

I don't agree with your claim, but I'm going to explain something else:
The GPL doesn't require software that *uses* GPL code to itself be GPL. 
It requires software that is *distributed* as part of a GPL work to
itself be GPL.  At time of distribution, a kernel module is neither
using nor linked to the kernel.
