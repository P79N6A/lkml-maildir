Hello,
I just installed linux on a box with a builtin Realtek 8139 chipset. 
Using the 8139too.o module caused all kinds of performance problems, and
there are  suspicious statements in the 8139too.txt file:
THIS DRIVER IS A DEVELOPMENT RELEASE FOR A DEVELOPMENT KERNEL.  DO NOT
USE IN A PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT.
However, I've used Donald Becker's rtl8139 driver in the past without
issues, and I'm using them now with v2.4.10.  I would like to request
that the stable code go back in place, please -- perhaps users can
choose between rtl8139 and 8139too?
Thanks!
