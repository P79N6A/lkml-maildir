	You probably want to check the man page on setrlimit instead. 
'ulimit' is a bash built-in for setting the rlimit's.  I note that on my
copy of the man page, it leaves out RLIMIT_AS though, which allows you to
limit the address space (and memory usage) for processes.  The parameter
in the rlimit structure is number of bytes of memory that should be
available to the process.  The other RLIMIT_* settings are documented on
the setrlimit page.
