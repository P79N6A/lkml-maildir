Only if supporting binary-only drivers is somehow considered 
important/useful.
I don't believe so - so I don't shoot my foot here.  :-)

Wrong.  It means that whoever want to change an API don't do so too lightly,
because there certainly is some work involved.  Even if it often only is
a big "grep" followed up by some trivial editing.  So, API change only
when there is a win offsetting this work. 
Such a process may seem inefficient if one were to schedule that work
among a limited workforce.  They had better not waste their time as that
block further options for profit. But only _companies_ work that way.
The kernel is different.  There are lots and lots of people, each working
on their favourite part. (Which is one reason why development scales so 
well.)
If someone does a time-consuming api change, then they aren't free to
do other work.  But if they don't do that api change - you can't schedule
other work for them anyway because they aren't employees.  They are
volunteers, their work don't cost any but it is also only for themselves
to decide what they work on. 
So the usual rules or common sense about work management
in a company do not apply.  Each patch is a gift you can't trade
for something else.

Well, if we have manageability, maintainability and flexibility
then we are very well off, even if it doesn't fit your definition
of scalability.

Again: Code reuse is nice, or even necessary, with a limited and
expensive workforce.  It is not a concern with an unlimited free
workforce though.  If some volunteer makes an improvement by
doing a big rewrite - well, the job gets done and nobody have to
pay him.  This works.  And you can't
get they guy to do something you find more useful "instead".  Maintainers
can refuse patches of course - this usually cause people to work less
on linux rather than working more efficiently on linux.  So even
a "lot of work for only a little gain" type patch is taken, if it is
technically sound.  Because the time couldn't be better spent anyway,
so it wasn't wasted.

I consider too many stacked layers inefficient.  Keep it simple . . .
