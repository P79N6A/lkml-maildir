The whole point of using the instruction is to allow hypercalls to be 
used in many locations.  This has the nice side effect of not requiring 
a central hypercall initialization routine in the guest to fetch the 
hypercall page.  A PV driver can be completely independent of any other 
code provided that it restricts itself to it's hypercall namespace.

Xen is currently using 0/1/2.  I had thought it was only using 0/1.  The 
intention was not to squash Xen's current CPUID usage so that it would 
still be possible for Xen to make use of the guest code.  Can we agree 
that Xen won't squash leaves 3/4 or is it not worth trying to be 
compatible at this point?
