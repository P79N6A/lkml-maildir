This is wildly untrue (as I believe you know Casey). The effectiveness
of SELinux is certainly diminished by not confining all applications,
but that in no way makes it dangerous. It simply means that certain
aspects of the security are no longer guaranteed by the policy but
instead rely on application correctness. SELinux still offers useful
protections against a variety security threats in a targeted
configuration.
This is in contrast to a security mechanism that is path based and
doesn't control all accesses which can make _no_ guarantees about any
security goals.
