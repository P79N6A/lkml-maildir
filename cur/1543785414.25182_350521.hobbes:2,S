My cardbus is acting funny. When I insert my netgear wg511 (prism54) the 
first time after booting 2.6.14-rc1 nothing happens. Nothing in dmesg, 
nothing nowhere. I remove it. Still nothing. Oh well. Inserting again. 
THEN it initializes and is working like it usually does.
2.6.13+Ivan's PCI resource patch worked allright.
I can live with this, but this is a regression.. I remember having 
exactly the same problem with some 2.4 kernel a few years back..
Any patch I should try backing out? Or some patch I should try?
