=== Linux 2.4.19-pre5-ac3-s43 kernel is out.
This is (as usual) CUSTOM TEST KERNEL with USE AT YOUR OWN RISK big letters
printed everywhere on it but ...
but it survived some LTPs here (unlike radix tree pagecache patch) and it at
least will go onto some production servers here (if not explodes :))
=== Introduction
My matchset is just another 2 cents to the overall chaos.
-stingr kernel has many uses. For example, it can be used on transparent
proxies and routers - because it always contain latest netfilter enhancements 
and suitable to run as single-nic (vlan) firewall.
=== Getting it from hostme.bitkeeper.com.
bk clone bk://linux-stingr.bkbits.net/stable4
-or-
bk clone -rv2.4.19-pre5 any-marcelo-tree stingr &&
cd stingr &&
bk pull bk://linux-stingr.bkbits.net/stable4
=== Getting it as a patch.
