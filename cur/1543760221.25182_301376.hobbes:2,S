I'm curious - do you have any micro benchmarks on i386 or x86-64 systems
about the difference between spin_lock(ptl) access; spin_unlock(ptl);
and cmpxchg ? 
cmpxchg can be quite slow, with bad luck it could be slower than 
the spinlocks.
A P4 would be good to benchmark this because it seems to be the worst
case.
