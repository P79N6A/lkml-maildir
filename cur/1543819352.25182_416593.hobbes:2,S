if you don't know the firmware requirements, then this is what I call
messed up. I now that this is basically the fault of the manufacturer or
missing specifications, but wild guessing on the firmware doesn't really
help. A kernel driver should know which firmware it needs.

I personally prefer full firmware names. This makes the dependency easy
and even an end user can call modinfo and see what firmware is expected
by a certain driver (without looking at the source code).
