Has anyone tested to see if "Snare" from intersectalliance.com can
detect someone executing a ptrace attack?  An old company I used to work
for has a number of production kernels out and can't just upgrade them
all over night so they need a good detection method and short-term fix
if possible.  In the past we had evaluated Snare which I pointed him to
but we're not sure if/how it might detect such an attack.
Thoughts/Theories?
