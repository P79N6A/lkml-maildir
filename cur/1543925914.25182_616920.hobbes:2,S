On HP ia64 systems, that information is locked away in ACPI, and
there's no easy way to get at it. Alex Williamson tried providing
a generic dev_acpi driver, so that userspace could do whatever
they wanted to with the information:
  
http://lkml.org/lkml/2004/8/3/106
And that effort kinda died. I'm of mixed feelings on that driver,
since it would be really nice to get unfettered access to the
ACPI namespace, but it's pretty dangerous, since any interesting
thing you might want to do is actually a method (aka, it calls
into firmware) and who knows what side effects there might be.
So from my point of view, if ia64 customers want to know about
the slots they have in their systems, we're gonna have to do
something kernel-intrusive anyhow.
Thanks.
