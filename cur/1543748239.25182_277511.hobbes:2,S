I wonder, would it make sense to add some limited anticipation
to the cfq scheduler?  It seems to me that there is room to
get some of the AS benefit without getting too unfair:
AS does a wait that is short compared to a seek, getting some
more locality almost for free.  Consider if CFQ did this, with
the added limitation that it only let a few extra read requests
in this way before doing the next seek anyway.  For example,
allowing up to 3 extra anticipated read requests before
seeking could quadruple read bandwith in some cases.  This is
clearly not as fair, but the extra reads will be almost free
because those few reads take little time compared to the seek
that follows anyway.  Therefore, the latency for other requests
shouldn't change much and we get the best of both AS and CFQ.
Or have I made a broken assumption?
The max number of requests to anticipate could even be
configurable, jut set it to 0 to get pure CFQ.
