Besides for me forgetting to change runtime->oss.buffer_used to
runtime->oss.period_bytes as other patch, the memset part should really
test if it should use 8, 16, 32 or 64 bit first, and I am sure there is
more to it to get the start position aligned, etc ...  But then, I do
not see how its going to fix anything, as you will now have silence
instead of it breaking up.
