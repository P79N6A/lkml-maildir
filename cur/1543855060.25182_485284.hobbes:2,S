I know this is how it's done now.  But it is not where it has to end. 
IMO we have to get to a solution where new events are posted to the ring 
buffer asynchronously, i.e., without a thread calling kevent_wait.  And 
then you need the extra parameter and verification.  Even if it's today 
not needed we have to future-proof the interface since it cannot be 
changed once in use.
