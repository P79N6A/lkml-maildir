A political regression only...  if EVMS is not good enough for inclusion 
in mainline, vendors can merge it and/or LVM2 to avoid problems.  _We_ 
have higher standards for quality :)  If no LVM is ready for 2.6.x, we 
have no LVM.  It's that simple...  If no one has stepped up to clean up 
LVM1, and LVM2 and EVMS are not ready for inclusion, there's not much we 
can do about it.  That's _not_ a reason to merge crap...

I'm sure he can elaborate, but AFAIK DaveM and Alexey are only doing 
IPSEC... where USAGI and IPSEC intersect, there will be clashes.  So if 
USAGI is waiting on IPSEC to submit more patches, things are waiting on 
DaveM.  But if there are IPSEC-independent patches, USAGI should go 
ahead and send them :)
