Yep. Like Linux getting the 3rd IDE on my ISA SB16 as a matter of course,
which WinNT claims doesn't exist. Like having to get a huge "driver" onto
WinNT for using a parallel Zip drive, which just works out of the box with
Linux. Or my notebook's (Win98se) network card driver, which hangs the
machine on boot if no network connection.
Don't get me started on "easy installation" and "autodetects everything"
with Windows.
Oh, wait. You are a troll, right?
