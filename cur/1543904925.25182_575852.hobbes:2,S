I tried to fix most of the checkpatch warning, except these 80col
warnings.
I don't think it's worth the work to fix the 80col stuff, yet.
I develop kernel code in the real console, and I have no problems
with this. Though, I use a wider console than 80col.
Let's better fix the worst 80col violations over time and not now.

Well, I intentionally wrote that this way, as in my opinion
it it easier to read. I only use this additional space for
functions returning a pointer.
struct foo * function(int a, int b);
vs:
struct foo *function(int a, int b);
But I can change that, if that's really an issue and a
style violation.

Agreed. I will change this.

You're right. I'll fix that.

I added a comment at the declaration of ssb_is_early_boot,
which tries to explain this in detail.

Hm, I tried that. There were problems. I don't remember this in detail, though.
This is called _really_ early in boot.

Well, /* flush */ :)
It simply waits and makes really sure the device is done.
This is a really critical place and we must make 100% sure
or we risk running into a machine check exception.

Yeah, think so. Good catch.

No, it's simply to avoid writing the SPROM concurrently.
SPROM writing is hairy and we must make sure here that
we are the only one accessing the whole bus. We do that
by suspending all devices and taking a lock to protect
the SPROM from write concurrency.

Well, as I already explained in a previous submission,
this is the hottest path in the SSB code. It's called with
every MMIO access. I intentionally did this inline to have
the likely path inline and all the unlikely paths out of
line. See the unlikely() branches, which are out of line.
