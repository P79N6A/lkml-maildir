What I am saying is "don't use the buffer cache at all" or any cache.
Don't use getblk.
Just:
   bh = kmalloc(sizeof(*bh));
   bh->b_data = rdev->sb; /* it is always one page */
   bh->b_rdev = rdev->dev;
   bh->b_rsector = sb_offset*2;
   bh->b_end_io = md_just_set_a_flag_and_call_wakeup;
   init_wait_queue_head(&bh->b_wait);
   bh->b_flags = 1<<B_Locked;
   generic_make_request(WRITE,bh);
   wait_disk_event((bh->b_flags & (1<<B_Locked)), bh->b_wait);
   err = bh->b_flags & (1<<B_Uptodate);
   kfree(bh);
   return err;
with typos corrected and a fairly obvious definition of
 md_just_set_a_flag_and_call_wakeup
fairly similar to end_buffer_io_sync.
