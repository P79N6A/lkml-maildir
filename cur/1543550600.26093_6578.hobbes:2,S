Ok. I originally had them outside locks as they appeared to be atomic. I
moved them in incase they were the cause of the problem.

The timer routines (there are 4) are used to switch hardware states and
must therefore be mutually exclusive with respect to the interrupt handler. 
There are no bottom halves used in this driver. Andrew Morton suggested
that the problem could be in my use of the skb pointers, which seems
a likely candidate. I'll check that.
