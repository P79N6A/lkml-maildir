Certainly at the moment, this is the only real use it has (and the only reason 
I spent any time working on a generic ACPI-WMI driver - probably one of the 
reasons Kconfig is somewhat neglected - ACPI-WMI is a means to an end for me 
(getting my laptop properly supported by another driver on top of it), not 
the end itself).
Although, given most of the other laptop drivers in drivers/misc use 'select' 
for various things, I don't see the harm here - unless anyone else has a 
great objection to acer-wmi and tc1100-wmi having 'select ACPI_WMI'?
