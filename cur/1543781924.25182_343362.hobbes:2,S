When only one thread waits on a condition variable, which is exactly a
scenario involved, --sorry if I weren't clear enough-- condition signal
provides precise control over which thread is woken up.

That returns us to the core of the problem: sched_yield() is used to
implement a synchronization primitive and non-portable assumptions are
made about its behavior: SUS defines that after sched_yield() thread
ceases to run on the CPU "until it again becomes the head of its thread
list", and "thread list" discipline is only defined for real-time
scheduling policies. E.g., 
int sched_yield(void)
{
       return 0;
}
and
int sched_yield(void)
{
       sleep(100);
       return 0;
}
are both valid sched_yield() implementation for non-rt (SCHED_OTHER)
threads.
Nikita.
