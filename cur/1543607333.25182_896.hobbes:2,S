the problem is that there isn't a patchset available from either aa or rik
that converts one to the other, the only patchset readily available
converts linus+aa to ac+rik this changes a lot more then just the VM stuff
so without going to a lot of effort it's not possible to directly compare
the two VM designs while keeping the rest of the kernel the same.
