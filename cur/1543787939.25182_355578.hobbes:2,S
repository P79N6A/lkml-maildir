You're right.  It's correct the way it is.
The placement of dynamic sched domains does not cause some
user visible change in behaviour that it makes sense for the
user to want to turn on for some cpusets and off for others.
Rather it is a performance optimization for scheduler scalability,
and the resulting domains must cover all the CPUs in the system.
So the placement of sched domains should not be a user option,
and should be done for all cpu_exclusive domains as it is
done now.
Good.
