I was wondering if anyone else is seeing what I'm seeing: while I'm playing
songs with "xmms", my CPU utilization gets pegged at 100% system, and "top"
reports that xmms is using almost all of it:

78 processes: 75 sleeping, 2 running, 1 zombie, 0 stopped

Mind you, top is obviously having some problems with the CPU timing here. But
I do notice other CPU-intensive jobs slowing down noticeably until I pause
XMMS, and heavy video activity (moving windows around, scrolling Netscape)
has more of a detrimental effect on audio playback than it used to, so I don't
think it is entirely an artifact of some /proc/stat change. I'm using a
trident card, and my hunch is that xmms is using either a blocking write or
select() to wait for the output buffer to become free, and the driver is
returning right away instead of blocking (or indicating writeability when it
shouldn't).
I don't know when exactly this started, but it was probably some time in the
2.3.40s . I'm at 2.3.99-pre2 now, and didn't see any trident.c changes in
-pre3. I usually play my mp3s while doing lots of other stuff, so I didn't
notice the unusual CPU utilization at first. I believe the trident driver has
seen some big changes in the past few months, perhaps one of them has a
problem?
Other mp3 players (mpg123, freeamp) don't have this problem on the same
kernel/hardware, and xmms doesn't have this problem with the same kernel on a
different system (a laptop with an nm256 sound chip), so I suspect it's
something about the way xmms is doing its audio output triggering a trident
driver bug.
Is anyone else seeing this? If so, I'll go build some old kernels and try to
see when the problem appeared. If not, I'll find a different player..
kernel 2.3.99-pre2
xmms version 1.0.1, using the "OSS output driver v1.0.1"
kernel: Trident 4DWave/SiS 7018 PCI Audio, version 0.14, 22:59:12 Mar 19 2000
kernel: trident: Trident 4DWave DX found at IO 0xd000, IRQ 10
