Older versions of driverloader won't even build for recent kernels
(actually even the latest - 2.34 - fails with 2.6.19-rc3). Do you know
of any driverloader version that actually works with 2.6.18+ and
misrepresents its license? Seems to me they gave up that practice and
currently the check is useless but if you want to keep it as a statement
I can understand that :)
