Let me add to the chorus of voices:  I continually see two cases where 
real bugs crop up:
1) hacker uses spin_lock_irq() in incorrect context (where it is not 
safe to do a blind enable/disable)
2) hacker uses spin_lock_irq() correctly, but the surrounding code 
changes, thus invalidating prior assumptions.
I would even go so far as to support the drastic measure of deleting 
spin_lock_irq().
spin_lock_irqsave() generates fewer bugs, is more future-proof, and by 
virtue of 'flags' permits architectures a bit more flexibility.
