I tried Suparna's mpage_writepages_getblocks patch with my
ext3_get_blocks patch, seems to work fine,  except that still only one
block is allocated at a time. I got a little confused.... 
I did not see any delayed allocation code in your patch, I assume you
have to update ext3_prepare_write to not call ext3_get_block, so that
block allocation will be defered at ext3_writepages time. So without the
delayed allocation part, the get_blocks in mpage_writepages is doing
multiple blocks look up only, right?
