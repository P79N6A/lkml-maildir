This is really hard.  How do you handle the case where process X
starts a transaction modifies files a, b & c, but process Y has file b
open for writing, and never lets it go?  Or the file gets unlinked?

What about programs that are already open and running?  
It might be doable in some sense, but I can see that details are
really hard to get right.  Esp without breaking existing Unix
semantics.  
But then again, I could be smoking something good (or bad :-) here, so
take what I say with a grain of salt.
