With this patch, even if taskstats _is_ enabled, we never call update_
on do_exit() path. Because there is no point to do this.

unlike taskstats, task_mem() doesn't rely on update_hiwater_xxx(),
it reads the current values and calculates the maximum. And this is
the "right thing".
update_hiwater_xxx() is only needed when we are going to decrease
the current value, so we can lose the info if we don't calculate
the maximum right now.
We can disable preemption around update_ in do_exit(), but this
doesn't close the race. We can even disable irqs but this (in
theory) is not enough either. But the main point we do not need
to update.
And please note that taskstats was wrong even if update_ was not
racy. Exactly because it relies on update_ in do_exit(), but it
should not.
As for ru_maxrss accounting, we can keep these update_hiwater_xxx()
calls in do_exit() and then use mm->hiwater_xxx directly, but we
should check group_dead in that case. I don't really think this
would be cleaner/better, and then we have the similar problems with
CLONE_VM tasks.
Oleg.
