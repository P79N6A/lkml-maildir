  Larry,
  Best technologies (as I see them, but I am not omniscient, of course)
  are those that do scoring.  E.g. naving some word NN might not alone
  be considered spam-signature, but it might increase score, and once
  the score exceeds arbitrary treshold (lower with short messages?),
  the message is considered spam, and rejected.
  Some recent TEXT/PLAIN spams have been encoded in BASE64 or ingenous
  QUOTED-PRINTABLE to avoid several common Perl-RE pattern using filters.
  I think there are several free codes of this kind available, but my time
  has been chronically over-subscribed to do radical things like taking
  this kind of codes into use.
