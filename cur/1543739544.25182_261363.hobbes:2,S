Care to provide a real example?
UDP isn't one. It was done for performance reasons as David admitted and it
could very well be done otherwise: do the checksum before select returns.
David has admitted the only reason Linux chose to do so is performance.
It might be the case that a million things might happen between select and
recvmsg, but none of them, as I can see, *have* to force Linux to work this
way. The only reason as I can see is performance and imlementation
convenience.
