I think three people have reported it now.

ok..  I spent a couple of hours yesterday trying to get this to happen.  No
joy.  Can't make it happen with your .config either.  I'll set up a 2.4.25

What version of gcc are you using?
Could you please capture the contents of /proc/meminfo and /proc/vmstats
when it's happening?
Thanks.
