I dont think this is a valid optimization. What we are checking here
is if a previously exclusive cpuset has been changed to a non-exclusive one
(echo 0 > cpu_exclusive), we then OR all the cpus in the current cpuset
to the parent cpuset. We then rebuild a sched domain to include all of the cpus
in the current cpuset and those in the parent not part of exclusive children
So I dont see why this can be done away with
