Although a UUID is slightly more difficult to manipulate than a clear text string, it
offers several advantages:
	- is guaranteed unique
	- generation is fully distributed
	- easy generation with uuidgen
	- fixed size
	- very easy to pass to the kernel, there is not char * in a struct pass to kernel
	- not to worry about '\0'
We use UUID to idenitfy a format + a version number. The version number can be useful
to identify backward compatible versions of a format.

I believe the module API + refcount make it safe against removal. When
perfmon does a lookup in the linked list of registered formats, it is not
clear to me what would protect it. I believe it would be safe if I used 
the rcu list instead of basic list.

I fixed that now. 
thanks.
