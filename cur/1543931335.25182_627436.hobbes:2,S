Subject: [patch 32/60] wait_task_stopped(): pass correct exit_code to wait_noreap_copyout()

2.6.23-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us
know.
------------------
From: Scott James Remnant <scott@ubuntu.com>
patch e6ceb32aa25fc33f21af84cc7a32fe289b3e860c in mainline.
In wait_task_stopped() exit_code already contains the right value for the
si_status member of siginfo, and this is simply set in the non WNOWAIT
case.
If you call waitid() with a stopped or traced process, you'll get the signal
in siginfo.si_status as expected -- however if you call waitid(WNOWAIT) at the
same time, you'll get the signal << 8 | 0x7f
Pass it unchanged to wait_noreap_copyout(); we would only need to shift it
and add 0x7f if we were returning it in the user status field and that
isn't used for any function that permits WNOWAIT.
