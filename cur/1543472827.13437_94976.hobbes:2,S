  Well, I havn't tried writing kernel code before and I have a couple of
  projects in mind, so I came up with this patch agains 2.0.36.
  It adds character device major 1, minor 10 from which bytes 0xff can
  be read. To use: patch, compile and boot your kernel and make a device
  with something like  
       mknod /dev/one c 1 10
  or   mknod /dev/ones c 1 10
  or   mknod /dev/~zero c 1 10
  or   ... 
  I do _NOT_ propose this for addition to the kernel because 
  a) The device char major 1, minor 10 has not been officially allocated.
  b) There is no need for this device anyway - you can use /dev/zero and tr.
  c) We do not seem to have a sensible name for it.
  This is just a newbie exercise in kernel hacking :-)
     Chris.
