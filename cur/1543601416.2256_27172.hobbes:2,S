Maybe it is not a single session disk?
Could you try
cdrecord -toc dev=x,y
where x,y are numbers returned for your SCSI (either native or emulated)
device by
 cdrecord -scanbus
I have never played with multisession disks so far, but I don't think dd
could read anything more than the first track ...

This would again make me suspect Win software does not produce 
single-session disks ...
