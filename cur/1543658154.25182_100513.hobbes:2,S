    Traditional (not *REAL*) visionaries that have incomplete visions, where
    the vision cannot be easily transferred from person to person without
    mutating, or losing its scope, are forced to sustain their efforts as
    a physical effort.
    *REAL* visions are like viruses. All you need to do is transfer the vision
    from one person to the next, and each time the image is transferred, the
    next person takes up the cross as their own, with all of the energy and
    motivation that the original visionary possessed.
These definitions equate "real" with "complete" with "transmitted
perfectly reliability".  I don't agree with that equation, but you and
I both observe that the vision of free software transmits with less
than perfect reliability.
Many successful social movements have been less than "real" in your
terms.   Success requires persistent work.
