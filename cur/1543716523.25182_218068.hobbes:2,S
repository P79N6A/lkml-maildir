I am having a similar problem to what Markus Kossmann wrote about, but 
with the VIA Southbridge (Asus K8V).  My situation is similar, but a 
little different.  I would like to boot off a PATA drive attached to the 
Southbridge, but use libata for a couple SATA drives attached to the 
same Southbridge.
Is this still not possible?  I also tried hde/hdg=noprobe options, but 
they didn't help the situation.  It appears the only way to get the 
drives on sata_via is to boot off of them.  Am I correct in thinking 
this is the only way to go about this?
