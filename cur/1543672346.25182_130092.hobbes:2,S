If you don't reduce NR_CPUS with CONFIG_NR_CPUS, you waste space (32 bit folks
won't like it) and if you say change CONFIG_NR_CPUS to 2, 
and we have cpuid 4 on a 2 way you break right?  If we have to address these
issues at all, why can't we use the simpler kmalloc_percpu patch
which  I posted in the morning and avoid so much complexity and arch
dependency?  
Thanks,
