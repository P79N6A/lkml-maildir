I guess I don't understand what that means. Are you suggesting moving 
pSeries_pci.c into the rpaphp code directory?

John Rose, the current maintainer of the rpaphp code, is pretty militant 
about removing things from, not adding things to, the rpaphp code.
Which is a good idea, as chunks of that code are spaghetti, and do need
simplification and cleanup.

Why do we need such an event?
I would prefer to deprecate the hot-plug based recovery scheme.  This
is for many reasons, including the fact that some devices that can get
pci errors are soldered onto the planar, and are not hot-pluggable.
