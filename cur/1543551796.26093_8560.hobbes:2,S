The're two cases : Firmware before boot, and firmware after boot.
The first is usually there to make sure you get your desired LILO prompt,
so usually not a problem. The kernel takes over, and in a lot of cases the
firmware is never used.
In the last case, you load something direct into kernel space. In case of
binary stuff you have no idea what actually happens. Also the case with
the before boot issue, but this plays a bigger role.
