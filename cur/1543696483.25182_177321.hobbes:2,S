Note - this was post incomplete and badly thought out - I never
intended this to go to the list, as evidenced by the [Off-list]
comment, and the only reason it was sent at all is because I hit send
instead of delete, (and hadn't trimmed the CC list yet).
What I originally intended to say in a private comment to Linus, is
that it might be worth trying to make people more aware that security
patches that went in to 2.4 never went in to 2.6, nothing more, and
nothing less.  I am NOT trying to put people off of testing, and never
have been, (which is the impression I got from your response).

No, I disagree.  If somebody's filesystem gets eaten, and they didn't
back up, well, they should have done.  That's common sense.
On the other hand, many users out there are _obviously_ under the
illusion that 2.6.0-test has no known security issues, and that is
false.  If their machine is internet-connected and compromised, it can
cause annoyance to third parties.  Given that, I think a file in the
root of the kernel tree, saying something like, "Don't use me on an
internet connected machine unless you know what you're doing" would be
worth considering.
John.
