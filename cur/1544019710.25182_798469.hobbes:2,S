There's a bit of a bootstrap problem using switch_to_new_gdt() on the 
boot CPU: it uses smp_processor_id, which ends up doing a 
percpu_read(cpu_number), which naturally crashes because %gs isn't set 
up yet.  Perhaps switch_to_new_gdt() should take the cpu number as a 
parameter (or at least a __switch_to_new_gdt variant which does).
