Note that the nVidia NIC driver, at least, continues to have open
reports of crashing net drivers that get reported to me :/  Since
nVidia will not provide documentation, who knows if this will ever
get fixed.
I would recommend sticking a 3rd party NIC in the board, and avoiding
the nVidia on-board NIC like the plague.
It is also worth noting that many nForce boards come with 8139
on-board.  I guess some board makers don't trust the nVidia NIC
hardware either...
