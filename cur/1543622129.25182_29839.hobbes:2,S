Hi,
The following patch fixes a small bug which prevented the Sym53c416 
driver from compiling. I don't know to which degree this is the right 
fix, since the 'address' field from struct scatterlist just seemed to 
magically disappear. If this was intended, meaning my fix isn't 
correct, I'd like to know about it.
