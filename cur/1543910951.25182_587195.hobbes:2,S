While I agree with you that side effects may be undesirable, I still think
it's important to ensure backwards compatibility in -stable branch, for the
following reasons :
  - people who use -stable want to ensure that they can upgrade in order to
    fix security issues or other bugs without risking (much) regression
  - you do not prevent buggy programs from doing wrong things by removing
    headers. What you will end up with is xosview using the quite common
    #ifndef UART_LSR / #define UART_LSR / #endif. In fact, there *may* be
    some legitimate uses of those defines, eventhough this program abuses
    its capabilities.
Eventhough it's not a good practise to rely on kernel headers for userspace,
at least we should limit build regressions on the user side, as it does not
help the end user understand that the program he builds is wrong.
Thanks,
Willy
