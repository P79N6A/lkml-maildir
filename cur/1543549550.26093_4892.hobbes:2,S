Yes, it increases list traffic with things that don't need to be on the
list. The odd second email isn't nearly as bad as seeing 100 posts that
don't need to be on the lists accidentally sent here. In practice the
majority of my linux-kernel email replies tend to not be back to the list.
Which is more wasteful of resources: 100 second emails? or 10 extras sent
to a few thousand subscribers?
The majority of my linux-kernel email replies tend to not be back to the
list.
