Each section has *two* obvious errors:
1. missing  ;then (or <newline>then
2. missing whitespace before "]"
And not only xconfig has problem with it. If you run Configure (make config)
you should see "syntax error near unexpected token `fi'" or "[: missing `]'"
Menuconfig probably just ignores the error ...
Are you able to set this variable ?
