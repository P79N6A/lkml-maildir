Maybe it is just some debug that can be safely ignored and removed from 
source? If two or more devices share an IRQ this is normal that when IRQ  
happens all of these drivers' IRQ routine is called. So maybe one of the 
drivers checks that this is not its device and prints this debug?

Maybe you are using eth0 and yenta is printing this debug...
Do you think that assigning the same IRQ for eth0 and yenta is good idea?  
Some network cards seem to raise _many_ IRQs...
Try to grep kernel source for this string and ask the maintainer for the 
driver that produces this message.
Hope this will help a little.
