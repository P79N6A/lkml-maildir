It's not regressing anything.

To fix the problem I introduced ? and because that patch to do so is
trivial and easy to test and verify.

Actually it didn't reserve BAR1 and BAR3 in legacy mode precisely because
of the PCI resource mismanagement in the old tree. So you take your pick.
BAR1 and BAR3 were used on all devices and not reserved, BAR5 is used on
two. Neither case is actually a problem in the current tree and driver
set. Both will be fixed when the combined mode junk gets fired into
hyperspace.
