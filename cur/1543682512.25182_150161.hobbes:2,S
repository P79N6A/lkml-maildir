Hello,
I've been testing the new kernel for a few days, so I thought someone 
could use my feedback about it. I installed it on my Dell Latitude C400 
laptop, which has a jp-106 keyboard; see the output of lspci at the end.

Problems:
- the "pipe" key is not responding anymore in text mode (init 3), 
although it works in xterm. Pressing the key doesn't print out anything.
- music is skipping when using xmms under CPU load, only during the 
first seconds of each track (until the entire file is cached?). xmms 
NEVER skipped with kernel 2.4.20, even under heavy CPU load. My hard 
drive has DMA enabled.
- the cursor under XFree86 4.3.0 gets "jumpy" under CPU load; as with 
xmms, it never did that with kernel 2.4.20.
- monitoring ACPI status (with WM dockapps) is overly CPU intensive: it 
takes from 5% to 35% of the CPU!!! I did not test ACPI with the stable 
kernel, and I couln't tell if the problem lies in user-land applications...
Improvements:
- ripping audio CD's with cdparanoia and the new ide-cd driver is waaaay 
faster now, as expected (jumped from 2 - 3x to 10x and up). I didn't 
manage to get cdda2wav to work with that driver, though.
- XFree86 loads faster.
- glxgears shows 260 FPS now, versus 150 FPS with the older driver, with 
my i830M chipset (I assume I have to thank the new driver for that?). 
Quake III Arena didn't gain from it though, I don't know why.
I've switched back to kernel 2.4.21, mainly because I know better how to 
handle it than the new one. I'm eager to see the stable version of linux 
2.6.0.
I didn't subscribe to the ML, but I read the newsgroup, so there's no 
need to CC me.
