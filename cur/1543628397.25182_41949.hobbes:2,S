Daniel, this is yet another example of you not answering the question asked.
Let's try it again.  Please answer the following question, since you seem
to have elected yourself to position of license policeman:
There are number of different places in the linux kernel source tree
where there are docs/code/whatever related to non-open source features
included in the tree.  Are you advocating a "cleansing" of all of these
or are you specifically targetting BitKeeper.  If you are only focussed
on BitKeeper, why?
That's two questions, just answer those, nothing but those.
