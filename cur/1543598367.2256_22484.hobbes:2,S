If you want to try, you can get close to what the chip is actually using
(with in 6-7 counts).  The counter if read back every interrupt by the
timer interrupt code and is used to compute:
		delay_at_last_interrupt = (count + LATCH/2) / LATCH;
This is done in ../arch/i386/kernel/time.c in the function
timer_interrupt().  To capture the value you could define a variable and
store count in it.  Possibly read this with /proc or more simply, use a
debugger to look at the value.  Or, even, set up a function to take the
max of several readings and printk the result.  The counter is reset to
the programmed value each interrupt (by hardware) and is counting down,
so it will be a few counts less than what was programmed.

P.S.  I wonder if the problem is related to other uses of LATCH...
