Your strlcat doesn't take into consideration that a zero bufsize could
mean that dest is not NUL-terminated, in which case strlen(dest) could
blow up in your face. Since strlcpy can handle zero bufsize, strlcat
should be able to handle being called just after strlcpy being called
with zero bufsize (see my patch).
I personally am not concerned either way, but it is definitely worth
noting.
