That works well on some Sun hardware.  It however can only work where it is
explicitly supported by hardware and most hardware, doesn't.
It's different if a CPU module fails in flight or is offlined
administratively.  If it does and the failure is just right then there is
little that can be done to protect the entire partition from crashing.  So
hot plugging capability doesn't give you a silver bullet against damaged
CPUs.  It's different with hardware that is designed to be fault tolerant
like Tandem's.
