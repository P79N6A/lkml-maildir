What I committed (to our source) is:

  }
And in system.h, this was added (because this is where all the other 
inlines is which messes with the interrupts are - and irq_flags is already 
defined here)

It seems to work OK.
Thanks for your help on this.
I think we have been weeding through everyone's comments, and have most 
things fixed up.
Are there any other major issues that you can see (that have not been 
pointed out).
