That depends on how much you care about the problems.
Some that come to mind:
The OOM killer will be more likely to kill the wrong process.
CPU usage stats will be worthless junk.
On a 4-way box, you can hit troubles with cutime after
just 2 weeks of usage.
Consider changing just cutime. It's the value most likely
to wrap. Plain utime would be the second priority.
