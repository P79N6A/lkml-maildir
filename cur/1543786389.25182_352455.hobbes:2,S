OK.  I assume this performance change is demonstrable in just
2.6.14-rc2+reiser4?  Beware that there are other changes in the -mm lineup
which might cause regressions.  Notably
	mm-try-to-allocate-higher-order-pages-in-rmqueue_bulk.patch
and
	per-task-predictive-write-throttling-1.patch
	per-task-predictive-write-throttling-1-tweaks.patch
