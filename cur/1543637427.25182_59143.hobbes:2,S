I'm not sure what Martin is talking about here.  I'm sure that
multiline macros are part of standard C.  The second translation phase
(immediately after character set mapping but _before_ preprocessing)
deletes any occurrences of \ followed by a newline.  The preprocessor
should not behave differently if a macro definition is broken up with \'s.
The copy of the ISO C standard that I have (the August 3, 1998 draft)
even has an example of a macro with a multiline definition in the
section on macro replacement.
I really doubt that gcc will break this standards-compliant,
extensively-used behavior.  Perhaps I misunderstood Martin but I don't
think there was anything wrong syntactically with the list macros
posted earlier.
Best,
  Roland
