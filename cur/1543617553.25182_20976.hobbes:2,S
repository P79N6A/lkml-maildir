Andrea your VM also works perfectly for me, and I think you are doing
a brilliant job on it. The only thing that I have noticed that worries
me is the lack of MemShared. I wass about to study the code and try to 
find out why it is always 0 kB on my PC, but these stats also show the
same results. Do you have any idea why this is so. I will still study
the code (just for the fun of it), maybe I might learn something about
te VM system.
