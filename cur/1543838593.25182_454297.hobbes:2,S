Hello
>Ok, there seems to be two distinct issues here. 1) Synaptics

Hmmm... perhaps "jerky" was the wrong choice of word.  I don't at all mean 
I've had a supersensitive touchpad: quite the opposite.  What I was trying 
to convey was the fact that when my pointer freezes, sometimes it becomes 
unfrozen again suddenly (for a brief time) and then moves forward a little, 
then gets stuck again, and in this way is "jerky".  So not supersensitivity. 
  (Apologies for any confusion).

>does not unfreeze the pointer)
Yes, I've been doing that as a worthwhile precaution.  Sometimes the pointer 
seems to get so stuck even when I plug in a normal mouse, it remains frozen. 
  Seeing as Linux is less easily controlled with the keyboard compared to 
MS-Windows, sometimes all I can do is Alt-tab to the terminal window and do 
a command line reboot.
(Off topic question: why not have the K menu open when the "MS-Windows" 
button on the keyboard is pressed, as happens with the "Start" button on 
MS-windows?)
*However*, I have noticed that sometimes when I alt-tab between any windows 
/ programs I have open, sometimes the pointer becomes unstuck again...

Battery charge level, yes, but not the box's temperature.  I have tried lots 
of apps to try and do this, e.g. gkrellm, but there is no support for this 
on my laptop.  Besides, these problems often evidence themselves soon after 
I switch on, so I don't think laptop temperature would still be a problem 
that early.  Also, I rip the occasional DVD, sometimes leaving my computer 
on for 5+ hours: it doesn't overheat.

Thank you for the suggestions.  I will try the kernel option, and post the 
results of the error log.
Yours,
