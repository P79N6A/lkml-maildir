Stackable dma-ops sounds good to me. The only problem is that there is a
performance penalty for devices handled on the bottom of the stack. But
the alternative I can think of, a per-device dma-ops structure, uses more
memory and is much more intrusive to the driver core. So I am fine with
a stackable solution.
