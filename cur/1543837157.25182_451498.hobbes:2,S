Hi all,
I have had these warnings for ages:
kernel/power/pm.c:241: warning: `pm_register' is deprecated (declared at 
kernel/power/pm.c:64)
kernel/power/pm.c:241: warning: `pm_register' is deprecated (declared at 
kernel/power/pm.c:64)
kernel/power/pm.c:242: warning: `pm_unregister_all' is deprecated (declared at 
kernel/power/pm.c:97)
kernel/power/pm.c:242: warning: `pm_unregister_all' is deprecated (declared at 
kernel/power/pm.c:97)
kernel/power/pm.c:243: warning: `pm_send_all' is deprecated (declared at 
kernel/power/pm.c:216)
kernel/power/pm.c:243: warning: `pm_send_all' is deprecated (declared at 
kernel/power/pm.c:216)
and I think at one time there was a fix about that I applied, but it seems it 
never made it into kernel.org.
Or is this my ggc problem?
Thanks,
Nick
