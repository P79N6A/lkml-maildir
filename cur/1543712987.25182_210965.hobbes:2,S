I have tried this with no luck. I still get 
(Badness in kobject_get at lib/kobject.c:42) which means it is not correct fix.
I am out of any more ideas except something like making sysfs single threaded 
or requesting people to try my sysfs backing store patch set. It does not
suffer from the negative dentries problem as it does not create any negative
dentries. I have to re-diff the patch set again to take recent changes into
account.
