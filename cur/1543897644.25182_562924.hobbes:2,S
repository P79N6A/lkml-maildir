c) if [1] AppArmor is considered to be something that wouldn't 
   be merged if it wasn't already widely deployed by Suse: leave it out, 
   work on an ideal solution [2], and let Suse wear the one-time cost
   of migrating their users to the ideal solution
One important point is that if AppArmor gets merged there will be much 
more distribution support for it, and many people on !Suse will start 
using it.
I'm not claiming to understand the technical details, but from both 
slightly reading over the previous discussions and the "What are the 
advantages of AppArmor over SELinux?" section in the AppArmor FAQ [3] my 
impression is that a main advantage of AppArmor are more user friendly 
userspace tools. Therefore, if [1] AppArmor is considered technically 
inferior to SELinux, it might still become more popular than SELinux 
simply because it's easier to use - and although it's technically 
inferior.
