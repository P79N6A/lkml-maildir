I don't think so.  As you said before sleep_on is perfectly fine for
the small part of code still covered by BKL, so we should not impose
any runtime overhead (i.e. warnings) but rather remind at compile time.
That's what's so nice with the gcc extension (and you won't see it
anyway as long as you stay at egcs 1.1 :))
