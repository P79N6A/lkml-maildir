I do believe you are trying to rationalize between NFS ver 2 and ver 3,
Linux right now does NFS v2 semantics - which according to the RFC does
not allow caching. I believe I have seen snipets of code for NFSv3 circling
around the kernel lately, so you should look into assisting the development
of these efforts to address your client side caching concerns.
