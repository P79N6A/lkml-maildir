I'm happy to do this if that is the consensus, but if you look at the rest of
the file, I'm simply following the standard that is currently in the file.  Are
you sure you want me to go and revamp that through the entire script?

Again, its the standard of the script.  All other sections are page aligned (or
rather were).  some recent changes have added a section data (a __tracedata
section I think), which is 4 byte aligned, which shifted the subsequent section
to be 4 byte aligned (the following note section as described in the PHDRS
section is prefixed with a simmilar ALIGN macro to bring it back into page
alignment.
Again, I'll repost with the adjustments you request, but first I'd like you please to
look at the file and make sure thats best.  Currently, I'm more comfortable with
the above, as it reflects the current standard of the script.
Regards
Neil
