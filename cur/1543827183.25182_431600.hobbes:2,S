If the kernel were bound by all the stakeholders' ability to _always_
"do the right thing" very little innovation would be possible.  These
tenuous arguments of hypothetical (ab)users are tiresome.
If the distro vendor did default to ext3+extents and it screwed your
hypothetical extents-naive user (booting a non-vendor kernel isn't
something your mom is going to do) then they strayed too far from
their Linux comfort-zone. If worst came to worst _THE UPDATED
EXT3UTILS WOULD PREVENT MOUNTING AN EXT3 FS WITH AN INCOMPATIBLE
FEATURE_.  God forbid the naive-user get an error when they try
something they shouldn't.
