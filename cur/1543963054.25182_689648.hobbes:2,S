Hello,
this is the last update of the mmu notifier patch.
Jack asked a __mmu_notifier_register to call under mmap_sem in write mode.
Here an update with that change plus allowing ->release not to be implemented
(two liner change to mmu_notifier.c).
The entire diff between v15 and v16 mmu-notifier-core was posted in separate
email.
