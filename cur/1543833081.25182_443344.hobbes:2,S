Fine with me. It's not fatal to the driver which is quite capable of
operating without that sysfs file, but ok, it *is* an error, and in
fact, if class_device_create_file() fails there must be something
seriously wrong.

Well, from my reading of the source, class_device_remove_file() should
be able to cope with that. The alternative would be to save off the
fact that the original creation failed somewhere in the driver data,
for the sole purpose of avoiding calling class_device_remove_file()
for it later.
