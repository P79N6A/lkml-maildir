yeah. Incidentally, i refined this last week and those nice-level 
granularity changes went into the upstream scheduler code a few days 
ago:

      sched: refine negative nice level granularity
      refine the granularity of negative nice level tasks: let them
      reschedule more often to offset the effect of them consuming
      their wait_runtime proportionately slower. (This makes nice-0
      task scheduling smoother in the presence of negatively
      reniced tasks.)

so could you please re-check chew jitter behavior with the latest 
kernel? (i've attached the standalone patch below, it will apply cleanly 
to rc2 too.)
when testing this, you might also want to try chew-max:
   
http://redhat.com/~mingo/cfs-scheduler/tools/chew-max.c
i added a few trivial enhancements to chew.c: it tracks the maximum 
latency, latency fluctuations (noise of scheduling) and allows it to be 
run for a fixed amount of time.
NOTE: if you run chew from any indirect terminal (xterm, ssh, etc.) it's 
best to capture/report chew numbers like this:
  ./chew-max 60 > chew.log
otherwise the indirect scheduling activities of the chew printout will 
disturb the numbers.

this should only affect non-default nice levels. Note that 99.9%+ of all 
userspace Linux CPU time is spent on default nice level 0, and that is 
what controls the design. So the approach was always to first get nice-0 
right, and then to adjust the non-default nice level behavior too, 
carefully, without hurting nice-0 - to refine all the workloads where 
people (have to) use positive or negative nice levels. In any case, 
please keep re-testing this so that we can adjust it.
