You can call intersegment with a full pointer. I don't know how
expensive that is. Since USER_CS is a fixed value in Linux, it
can be hard-coded
		.byte 0x9a
		.dword 0xfffff000
		.word USER_CS
No. I didn't try this, I'm just looking at the manual. I don't know
what the USER_CS is (didn't look in the kernel) The book says the
pointer is 16:32 which means that it's a dword, followed by a word.

Why is the government concerned about the lunatic fringe? Think about it.
