ok... you are right...
Consequently this help could be a bit more explicit:
config USB_STORAGE
        tristate "USB Mass Storage support"
        depends on USB
        select SCSI
        ---help---
          Say Y here if you want to connect USB mass storage devices to your
          computer's USB port. This is the driver you need for USB floppy 
drives,
          USB hard disks, USB tape drives and USB CD-ROMs, along with
          similar devices. This driver may also be used for some cameras and
          card readers.
For example we can add something like this:
NOTE that these devices use SCSI emulation, so remember to enable the needed 
support in "SCSI Devices" section (for example: enable "SCSI Disk Support" 
if you are going to use USB hard drives).
