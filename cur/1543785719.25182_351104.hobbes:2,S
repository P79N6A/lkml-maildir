You just saying that ;)
Look at I2C/sensors people. They are moving from having every sensor
crampled into I2C bus to hwmon class so all the sensors can be easily
located (by some program or what's not).

Why is this a factor? We are not talking about /dev here. We have a
lot of things in sysfs that are not directly accessible from
userspace.

I'll try fix the patch I posted last night (that implements the above,
or at least what Kay described with sub-devices residing under their
parent devices and symlinked into their classes), I believe it could
also be used for block, so it will be like:
.../block/
|-- devices
|   |-- sda
|   |   |-- device -> ../../../../
|   |   |-- sda1
|   |   |   |-- dev
|   |   |   `-- device -> ../../../../../block/partitions/sda1
|   |   |-- sda2
|   |   |   |-- dev
|   |   |   `-- device -> ../../../../../block/partitions/sda2
...
`-- partitions
   |-- sda1 -> ../../../class/block/devices/sda/sda1
   |-- sda2 -> ../../../class/block/devices/sda/sda2
--
