I have a Lion with 4 666mhz B3 stepping cpus and 4GB ram running Debian
unstable with kernel 2.4.18 and the 020410 ia64 patch (I have the same
problem with 2.4.9-itanium-smp from the archive).
I have a program that reads large files in increments of 81920 blocks.
After about 9600 read calls I get about a dozen reads that take about 3 
seconds each.  Does anyone have any ideas as to a cause/solution?
(I have 4 other threads working/possibly writing output at the same 
time, although in this case only 1 of them would be active at 
the same time).  I am also running a program that callocs almost all my 
ram to make sure none of the file is cached.
I can provide more info if necessary.
Here is a partial log I made (read#/time in seconds):
