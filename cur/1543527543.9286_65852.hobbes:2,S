The following is found in sysrq.c
#ifdef CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ
int sysrq_enabled = 1;
#endif
Can someone explain why?  I mean, if CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ is not
enabled at all, then sysrq.c isn't compiled at all - correct?
So if it isn't compiled then the above ifdef will never get
seen.  If however CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ *IS* defined, then the
feature is enabled, sysrq.c gets compiled, and the ifdef block
above is automatically going to be true.
So the ifdef is pointless and redundant no?
If not, please explain why.
