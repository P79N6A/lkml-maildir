Not quite.
-mm is git trees plus an amazing amount of random patches that turned up 
on LKML, a lot of which is not destined for kernel release 2.6.(X+1) or 
2.6.(X+2),

Yes :(  That's a tough problem to solve, too.
Deadlines always motivate people, and so -- as in almost every other 
software project I've worked with -- everybody seems to submit their 
work on the day of the deadline.
Realistically, for the merge window to work perfectly, each step down 
the maintainership ladder needs to have time to review and integrate the 
changes destined for that merge window.  Ideally, people would do all 
this work beforehand, so that each step up the ladder has time prior to 
merge window for review and testing.
But that's just not software engineers as we know them ;-)

Indeed.  Particularly in this case, where bsg didn't really grace -mm at 
all.

My goal AT A MINIMUM with netdev and libata is to get stuff in at least 
one -mm release prior to merge window opening (though preferably a 
longer lead time than that).  Of course, reality intrudes, but that's my 
goal.
And I think it's a reasonable goal to push upon others (but I'm biased:))
