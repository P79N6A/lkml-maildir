  Hi, all. Version 3 of my msr patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
Some documentation is also available here.
The patch provides user space access to Model-Specific Registers (MSRs)
and Performance Monitoring Counters (PMCs) via device driver interfaces.
This is against 2.2.0+devfs. Highlights of this release:
- Fixed bugs in perfmon ioctl()s for reading/writing PMCs
- Included patch which adds an ioctl() on /proc/<pid>/mem for
  translating virtual to physical addresses
				Regards,
					Richard....
