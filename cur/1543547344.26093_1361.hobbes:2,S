urgh, i think you've missed the point.
while threads /may/ be abused by many applications where fork() or 
decent-event-queue/state-machine would probably produce much better 
performance (i believe some of the java libraries are a perfect example of 
this), there are _MANY_ applications where threads work, work well, and are 
superior to the alternatives available (fork with shm segments).
one such example is cpu compultationally-expensive work where some degree 
of working-set is required to be shared between processes.  one could use 
fork(), run multiple instances, have them register to a shm segment and 
then implement some form of IPC between them.
alternatively, you could create 'n' work threads where "n == NR_CPUs" with 
the working-set automatically available to all worker threads.  for 
whatever synchronization is required, you don't have to write your IPC 
mechanism - mutexes come standard with things like pthreads.  (of course, 
there is no excuse for bad programming or bad algorithms; mutex use should 
be kept to a minimum).  perhaps you then need this application to then do 
bulk disk-i/o?  one-thread-per-disk-spindle works nicely in this scenario too.
threads are useful and powerful.  perhaps the real problem with threads are 
that it is too easy to write bad code using them.
caveat emptor.
cheers,
lincoln.
