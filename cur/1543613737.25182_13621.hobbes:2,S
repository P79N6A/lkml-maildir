Hmm, there are lots of embedded things with network capabilities.  Think of
wireless access points, network routers and switches.  Even a network
printer can cause network chaos if it would start to chatter on the net.
Many of these things run FTP or HTTP servers for management purposes.
However, figuring out how to hack into a non-standard piece of hardware
using an unknown processor is a non-trivial problem - it is very difficult
even if you designed the thing yourself and has all the info, but could
therefore be done by a disgruntled ex-employee.
Exploiting well known network services  such as FTP and HTTP for dark
purposes certainly should be a serious concern to manufactureres of these
devices.
