RTC is hooked early in boot process. It should be available even sooner
than rootfs is mounted. Therefore RTC drivers are usualy compiled in
kernel. Anyway, exporting that function shouldn't hurt :)

I'm not sure if adding yet another driver specific header is a good
idea. Perhaps we should consolidate I2C RTC drivers a bit more and
create common header for them?

Document the fact that ds1337 driver works also with DS1339 real-time
clock chip.
