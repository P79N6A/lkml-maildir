Hi,
I hope to have addressed all Hugh's latest comments in this version.
Its against 2.6.17-mm1, however I wasted most of the day trying to 
test it on that kernel. But due to various circumstances that failed.
So I've tested something like this against something 2.6.17'ish and 
respun against the -mm lineup.
I've taken Hugh's msync changes too, looks a lot better and does indeed
fix some boundary cases.
Peter
