Use defconfig and boot it.  If you break ptrace, I think it's
overwhelmingly likely that UML will stop booting.  So if UML boots,
I'd say you're good to go, with one caveat.  That is, UML should
report at boot that PTRACE_SYSEMU works.  I put in a fallback from
PTRACE_SYSEMU to PTRACE_SYSCALL when Fedora broke PTRACE_SYSEMU.

For current -mm, you'll need
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=119635496908681&q=raw
 to build.
