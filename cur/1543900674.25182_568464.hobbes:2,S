That's how it is often done elsewhere, but (at least until now) the
correct way to achieve this in Linux is to make use of either
per-process namespaces or chroots.  For example, either create custom fs
trees for each user under /share/ and chroot user hallyn under /share/hallyn
upon login, or, upon login, create a new mounts namespace and massage
the fs tree there.
For persistant filesystems, you can of course keep custom versions of
the filesystems in hidden directories.  I.e. under /tmp/ you could
keep /tmp/.priv/hallyn, and, when hallyn logs in, do
	mount --bind /tmp/.priv/hallyn /tmp
or if you're going the /share route, just do
	mount --bind /share/hallyn/tmp/.priv/hallyn /share/hallyn/tmp
while setting up your trees after boot.
For procfs and sysfs, the containers (specifically process id namespaces
and network namespaces) are starting some of the work to support
showing only authorized data to containers.
