How is this more authorative than a userspace app ?
If a new feature flag appears that the kernel doesn't know about,
it won't get picked up. Just as it won't in a userspace app.
The difference being, someone can grab the latest version of the
app without needing to update their whole kernel.

Updating userspace is less impact than kernel updates.

That would be even more overkill.  The cpuid driver does everything
you need, in userspace.  It has established userspace users.
Do you expect those users to switch over to /proc/cpuflags ?
It won't happen, and adding duplicate interfaces is just pointless.

No, it does not.  All you patch brings afaics is the need to parse
ASCII (/proc/cpuflags) vs binary (/dev/cpu/n/cpuid), and we
already have a /proc/cpuinfo for that.
