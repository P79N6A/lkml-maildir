Hi Christian,
is it true, that your X-Server runs with a higher priority? Perhaps
you are a Debian user?
If thats the case try to make your X-Server run with normal
priority. That fixed sound problems here too. I had the problem that
I could not play an mp3 file without distortion while compiling a
kernel.
