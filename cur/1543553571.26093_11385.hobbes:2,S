Yes, there is. It's INIT_TASK_SIZE. See include/linux/sched.h for
this.

kmalloc() and kfree() it instead.

Because it's an overall kernel limit. Once you are in kernel
mode, you have less than the above amount of stack. So don't use
it for sth. more complex then pointers or ints. And avoid
recursion as hell.
The kernel will not oops, but instead overwriting your
current task_struct.

Check the assembler stage output ;-)
