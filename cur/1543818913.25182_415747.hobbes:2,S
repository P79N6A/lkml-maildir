Very very cool. Thanks for persisting.

When you get around to it later, there is one case you may hit that Bob
Picco encountered and fixed for me. It's where a "new" range is registered
that is inside an existing area; e.g.
add_active_range:    0->10000
add_active_range: 9800->10000
It ends up merging incorrectly and you end up with one region from
9800-10000. The fix is below.
