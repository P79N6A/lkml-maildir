Thanks Andrew.

I agree --- both with it being ugly, and that being part of why.

I would be curious regarding any ideas on that.  Next time I read
through that code, I will keep in mind that you are open to making VFS
changes if it improves things, and I will try to get clever somehow and
send it by you.  Our squalloc code though is I must say the most
complicated and ugliest piece of code I ever worked on for which every
cumulative ugliness had a substantive performance advantage requiring us
to keep it.  If you spare yourself from reading that, it is
understandable to do so.

Thanks to you and the batch write code, direct io support will now be
much easier to code, and it probably will get coded the soonest of those
features.  acls are on the todo list, but doing them right might require
solving a few additional issues (finishing the inheritance code, etc.)
