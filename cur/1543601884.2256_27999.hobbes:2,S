I am rewriting he wrapfs from the fist project and is now in a debugging
stage, it is now quite ready for experimental tests.
The idea is orinigally from FiST, a stackable file system. But the FiST
owner Erez seems given up to maintain the project. At the time I receive
the code, it is so buggy, even unusable, lots of segmentation fault
problems. I have debugging the fs for quite a while. Now it is useful in
just use as a file system wrapper. It is useful in chroot environments
and hardlinks aren't available. It wraps a directory and mount to
another directory on tops of any filesystems. I wish to maintain this
file system development since FiST's idea is good. It allow to use this
base wrapfs as a template and then you can do encryption and other
operations on it with fast development time. If any kernel file system
maintainer is interested, please contact me .. I would like to get help
to finish up my debugging work. The result will be GPL'ed. I will also
package it with the fistgen package as a file system development tool.
Thanks.
regards.
