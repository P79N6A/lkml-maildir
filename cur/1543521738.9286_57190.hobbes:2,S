Actually, I thought the main reason we all looked like idiots w.r.t. Y2K was 
because we spent so long running around like blue-arsed flies going on  
about how catastrophic it was going to be, then nothing much actually went 
wrong - even in places where they had spent nothing on trying to fix it.
The UK government spent so much money on winding people up about it that they 
then had to run another ad campaign just to reassure people that the world 
wasn't going to end :)
