Theorically, make sense. I said theorically because all the use 
epoll_wait MT use cases I've heard of, use a single thread that does the 
epoll_wait, and then dispatch to worker threads. So thundering herd is not 
in the picture. OTOH, it does not hurt either.
But, that code is completely changed with the new single-pass epoll delivery 
code that is in -mm. So, I'd either wait for that code to go in, or I 
(or you, if you like) can make a patch against -mm.
