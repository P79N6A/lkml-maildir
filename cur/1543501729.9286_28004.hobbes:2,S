Hi,
I'm using 2.2.10 UP and I've got some problem on $SUBJECT using masquerade.
There are some machines connected via eth0 to te server, and eth1 with
cable modem, connected to internet. I must measure IP traffic per
host. Man pages say that replies to masqueraded packets does not pass the
forwarding firewall, so I how can I count theme ? Please tell me some
ipchains settings to measure forwarded input AND ouput traffic from
the localnet TO internet per host basis. Maybe this is not the right place
for this question but I tried other Linux lists before without any
responds ;-(
Thx a lot:  Gabor,
