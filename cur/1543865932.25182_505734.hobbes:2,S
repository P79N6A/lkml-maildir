I didn't say that clearly, I meant that the information to do this was 
present, not the functionality.
Someone suggested that 'requires' was a synonym of 'depends on' and was 
a bad choice. I think the requirement is in fasct the same, what I was 
after was not to prevent visibility of the option as 'depends' does. And 
we still probably need depends to avoid way too many choices.
