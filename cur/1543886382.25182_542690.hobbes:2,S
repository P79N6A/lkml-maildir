Hi,
We have a our own userland NFSD and NLM service running that implement
all the NLM/NFS functionality.
We do not want to modify the way the client does his mounts.

This doesn't make any sense to me at all.
You can certainly have the NFS client compiled and even running without
lockd running (if you mount with "-o nolock") and in that case you are
free you register your owner user-space NLM server (though I'm not sure
what good it would do you).
And if you want to mount an NFS filesystem without "-o nolock", then you
really need the kernel lockd running, or locking will not work.
Can you explain what you are trying to do - I'm curious.

Uhm...  Do you mean
  +#ifndef NLM_PROGRAM
??  Still not sure how that helps.
