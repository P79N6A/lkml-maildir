You need to compile with CONFIG_SYSCLT set to 'y' rather than 'n'.
Alternatively, you can probably fix it by just upgrading user-land, but 
the SYSCLT thing _does_ still exist, it's just deprecated and defaults to 
off by default..
(Or you can possibly even choose to just ignore the warnings, they 
probably won't affect any actual behaviour)
