Subject: Question regarding ERR in /proc/interrupts.

Is there anyway to log each ERR to a file or way to find out what caused 
each ERR?
For example, I know this is the cause of a few of them:
spurious 8259A interrupt: IRQ7.
But not all 20, is there any available option to do this?
$ cat /proc/interrupts
