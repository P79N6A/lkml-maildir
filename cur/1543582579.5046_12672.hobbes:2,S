So I'm using 2.4.1 now (on advice given by Alan Cox on the lkml related to
the ext2 fs problems talked about in the lkml archive based on the belief
that the vm was fixed in some manner related to these crashes).  The same
code as below and the same problems.  I changed the brelse() call to
bforget() - same deal except that the memory dedicated to buffers remains
constant.  It is my understanding that when calling
wait_on_buffer(bh) this in effect makes sure the operation has been
committed to disk and will give you the same result as performing a
sync().  I can trigger panics during the operation or after
the operation - the fragility seems to remain persistent.  Panic's seem to
quite consistently be 'unable to handle kernel paging request at <some
address>' or of the 'unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at
virtual address <some address>' nature.
Any other suggestions?
