When Denys brought up the zeroing thing and mentioned kzalloc() I did
consider kcalloc() instead, but kzalloc() makes this allocation nicely
look like the preceding ones visually and I couldn't convince myself
that kcalloc() would give us any real benefit here.
What exactely would using kcalloc() over kzalloc() here buy us?
