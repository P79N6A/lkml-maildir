Not really different, but rather an attempt to use hardware in a 
native/direct fashion w/o running circles.  But first let's look at the 
reasons that led the industry to this mem/disk personality split.
Consider these archs:
	bits	space
	8	256
	16	64K
	32	4G
	64	16GG=16MT
	128	256GGGG=256TTT
	
It follows that with 
	8 and 16 bits you are forced to split
	32 is inbetween
	64 is more than enough for most purposes
	128 is astronomical for most purposes
	 :
	 :
So we have a situation right now that imposes a legacy solution on hardware 
that is really screaming (64+) to be taken advantage of.  This does not mean 
that we have to blow things out of proportion and reinvent the wheel, but 
instead revert the workaround that was necessary in the past (-32).  
If reverted properly, things should be completely transparent to user-space 
and definitely faster, lots faster, especially under load.  Think about it.
Thanks!
