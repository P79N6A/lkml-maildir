Thanks for the timeline, may it continue! I can't believe how long I 
have run machines once they became stable... my last 1.2.13 machine was 
taken down on Y2k-eve, I still have a 2.1.106 machine running, and a 
2.0.33 machine was upgraded to RHEL-3.0 early this year. Speaks well for 
stability that machines without security issues can just run virtually 
forever.
