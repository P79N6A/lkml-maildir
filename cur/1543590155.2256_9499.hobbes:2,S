No.  Not for uptime.
The "responsibility" for process completion does not get delegated. A process
will always be bound to it's home-node (in mosix terms), no matter how far
it's "teleported".   If the home-node fails, the process won't know what hit
it.
There are good reasons why mosix let's processes depend on their home nodes.
This is not meant as backstabbing mosix, it's a great environment for a lot
of things.
But it's not the universal silver bullet.
