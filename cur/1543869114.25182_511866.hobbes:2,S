So how well does Tux fare on a NUMA box?  The Solaris 2.0 reference
was not about the origins of the code, it was about the era when SMP
first became relevant to the UNIX application programmer.  I remember
an emphasis on scheduler scalability then, too.  It took them quite a
while to figure out that having an efficient scheduler is of little
use if you are scheduling the wrong things on the wrong CPUs in the
wrong order and thereby thrashing continuously.  By that time we had
given up and gone back to message passing via the network stack, which
was the one kernel component that could figure out how to get state
from one CPU to another without taking all of its clothes off and
changing underwear in between.  Sound familiar?

Well, maybe I'll let someone else weigh in about whether I understood
threadlets well enough to provide feedback worth reading.  As for the
"hobby OS forever" bit, that's an utter misrepresentation of my
comments and criticism.  Linux is now good enough for Oracle to have
more or less abandoned Sun for Linux.  That's as good as it needs to
be, as far as Oracle and IBM are concerned.  The question is now
whether it will ever get substantially _better_, so that you can do
something constructive with a NUMA box or a 64-core MIPS without
having the resources of an Oracle or a Google to build an
OS-atop-the-OS.
Cheers,
