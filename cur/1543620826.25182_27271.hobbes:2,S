Hi Alan,
nope ... this also appears with the Fasttrack66-card unplugged , last time it appeared during the fsck of / on startup ( without 
any already loaded mods) .. on thing that always stays the same is the stack-page of c1131000 .. 
well i may see that all this tells little on cause , but what kind of hardware could that be ?? there ist only motherboard , Cpu, SCSI,IDE, PCI-Bridge and RAM left 
thanks
