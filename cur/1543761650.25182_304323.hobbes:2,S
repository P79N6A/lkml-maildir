Just for reference that is the link to their thread form March 15:
http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=11165076
If it is an udev issue it would explain why the dongle was working when
plugged in before the booting the machine.
If there is a patch flying around that is supposed to fix this issue,
please let me know!
Best,
