Good heavens, for the love of life and everything pure and good in the
world, no!
Perhaps we can get a kernel.org git tree?  Each submission can be put in
as seperate branches.
For instance I have already been doing this for several submissions, see
  
http://vserver.utsl.gen.nz/gitweb/?p=vserver;a=heads
This doesn't include Dave's or Kirill's patches yet (as of -0328T15:53
+12).
OK, now it does (as of -0328T17:23+12).
I am more than happy to continue to track people's submissions in this
way, but they probably belong on kernel.org
