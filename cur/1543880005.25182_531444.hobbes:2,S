Can I make a suggestion?
Would it be possible (from now on) to publish changes relevant to the 
previous patch (eventually leading to a series of patches that describes 
the evolution of the new scheduler) so that it's easier for us 
reviewers/critics to see the latest changes.  E.g. if import such 
changes into something like quilt (using my gquilt GUI wrapper, of 
course :-)) I can then use meld (or similar) to follow what's going as 
suggestions get folded in and bugs get fixed etc.
Thanks
Peter
