You seem to be suggesting to use the same ID for primary and extended
paritions. 
I'm kind of afraid that this approch could cause the "ID"s to jump if I 
slightly modify layout of the disk, am I wrong?
Say I have :
	primary 1		p1
	primary 2		p2
	extended 		
		ext 1		p4
		ext 2		p5
	primary 4		p3
Now I say that I delete the extended partition and replace it with a
primary one to : 
	primary 1		p1
	primary 2		p2
	primary 3		p3
	primary 4		p4
I think in the above scheme the ID for primary 4 will jump even if the
partition itself does no change. It will go from p3 to p4! It is exactly
the thing I want to avoid.
I think ideally the primary partitions and extended sup-partitions should
use separate ID's. I think the extended sup-partitions could be equivalent
to bsd slices which can be placed inside of primary partition too.
