Which is a value judgement made based upon the cost of memory, the
memory limit of the system (and the fixed kmalloc limits).
Obvious fix Albert would be to post patches which 
	-	Ignore the font size limits (up to sanity point) for 
		CAP_SYS_something
	-	Put the limit in sysfs where it belongs
	-	Use vmalloc not kmalloc if neccessary
