Can someone give me a layout of what exactly is up there?  I got the
basic idea
K 4G
A 3G
A 2G
A 1G
App has 3G, kernel has 1G at the top of VM on x86 (dunno about x86_64).
So what's the layout of that top 1G?  What's it all used for?  Is there
some obscene restriction of 1G of shared memory or something that gets
mapped up there?
How much does it need, and why?  What, if anything, is variable and
likely to do more than 10 or 15 megs of variation?
