meanwhile i've mostly debugged the problem: it's an illegal recursion
into the timer code caused by PREEMPT_TIMING printks from within the
timer code calling do_poke_blanked_console() which in turn calls
del_timer() ...
this bug has been in the PREEMPT_TIMING code for almost forever, it's
just that under PREEMPT_REALTIME all the other latency sources are gone,
only the few places that still use raw spinlocks are remaining, amongst
them the timer code ...

great! :) I strongly suspect this bug is the one Lee and Mark are seeing
too.
