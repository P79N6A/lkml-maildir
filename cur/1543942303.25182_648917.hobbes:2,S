This is ide-generic problem exhibited by recent ide_device_add_all() changes.
Fix below (it works for me) - you may merge the patch as it is or wait an hour
or so for the next IDE tree pull request.
Also sorry for the issue in the first place (it turned out that it slipped
my testing because I has been running with IDE_MAX_HWIFS=2 for some time :).

The commit 139ddfcab50e5eabcc88341c8743a990ac1be6a2 ("ide: move handling of
I/O resources out of ide_probe_port()") changed the ordering of hwif->noprobe
check vs ide_hwif_request_regions() call (so that we now reserve I/O regions
before checking for hwif->noprobe).  However ide-generic host driver depended
on hwif->noprobe to be set for skipping probing of empty ide_hwifs[] slots.
Fix it by passing only indexes of non-empty slots to ide_device_add_all()
from ide_generic_init().
