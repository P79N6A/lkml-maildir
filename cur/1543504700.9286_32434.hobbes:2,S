What exactly do you mean by "start rather than either end"?  The start is one
end...
Also if we change the start of an active partition then we must also call the
file system code on that partition and tell it to change it's offset for
everything (significant change).  For the end to change we just need an IOCTL
to advise of the new size.
I am not up to coding this.  I will have a go at making the kernel re-read as
long as you don't change mounted file systems in ways other than the FS type.
