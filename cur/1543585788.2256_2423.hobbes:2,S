The -TOO suffix was to distinguish between this and the former 8139
driver, as the two coexisted in 2.2 and 2.3.  As the old driver has
been dropped from 2.4, I propose likewise dropping the -TOO.
Oh, BTW -- an alternate approach to making the kernel tree compatible
with CML2 would be to make CML2 compatible with the kernel tree.
Define a character (say '%') as an optional prefix for a configuration
symbol.  This character would only be required where the symbol would
otherwise by misparsed, as with '[0-9].*'.
