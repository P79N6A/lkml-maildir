If a board needs these kinds of controls, I would much prefer that
there is a way to get to it without going through the generic PPP
code.  E.g. there could be a character device for the board which can
have its own set of ioctls for controlling the board.  Or it could use
a file under /proc or something.  I would rather not clutter up the
generic ppp code with stuff for low-level channel control.
With async ttys we already have this, since you can open /dev/ttyXX
and get an fd, set it to ppp line discipline, then do ppp ioctls on
it.
Paul.
