No, _not_ so.  How is the SCHED_NORMAL (didn't that used to be called 
SCHED_OTHER?) task ever going to receive the cpu when a realtime task is 
runnable given that 1. task selection is done via sched_find_first_bit(), 
and 2. realtime queues reside at the top of the array?

See the definition of rt_task() in sched.c, and the comments in sched.h 
beginning at line 266.
