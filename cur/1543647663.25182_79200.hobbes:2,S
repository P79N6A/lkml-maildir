2.5.41 didn't boot on the test machine.
2.5.42 does boot on the test machine, and exhibits the same problems
Typical scenario:
MMX-200 with plenty of RAM (128 MB), and a 16550A UART running 2.5.40
doing a 9600 bps Z-Modem transfer to
486 SX-20 with 4 MB RAM, and a 8250 UART, running 2.5.42
From time to time, (every 4-8K or so), the Z-Modem protocol will
detect an error, and re-send blocks.
This does not occur with 2.2.13 or 2.2.21 on the 486.
Usually the errors occur at the same time as hard disk accesses, but
turning on IRQ unmasking does not prevent them.  Also, sometimes the
hard disk is accessed, and no error occurs.
