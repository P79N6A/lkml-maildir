  Well, I was just thinking
  do_rw_taskfile + (do_)flagged_taskfile -> do_taskfile.
  If you like do_rw_taskfile better, I guess that's okay too. :-)

  Oops, I forgot that.  Still, it was kind of weird before.  If any of 
tf_{in|out}_flags is set, flagged_taskfile() is called and ->data_phase 
was used, but, if none of the flags was set, do_rw_taskfile() was called 
and the command is used to determine the same thing.  But, yeah, it's 
user-visible.

  Okay, I'll resurrect that test.

  Sure, I'll do it now.
  Thanks.
