Before this patch, I would see out-of-resource messages when I ran
50Mbps+ traffic + bonnie++ on a P-III 550Mhz machine.  With this patch,
I see no error messages, and traffic is flowing fine...
So, seems like a winner to me!
PS.  I don't currently have any machines available to test the
cmd-timeout issues with the eepro driver and some NICs.  Has
anyone tested to see if this patch actually fixes those problems too?
Thanks,
Ben
