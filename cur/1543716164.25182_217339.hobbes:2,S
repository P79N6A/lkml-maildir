Shailabh posted the latest CKRM code to lkml yesterday.
CKRM + rcfs seems to be slightly more capable than the PAGG code;
furthermore, CKRM already has a number of resource controller
modules while I'm only seeing very basic PAGG infrastructure.
Now would be a good time to join forces...
I admit that the CKRM project so far seems to have been mostly
an IBM internal project, but since there is community interest
it'd be time to get the community involved.
