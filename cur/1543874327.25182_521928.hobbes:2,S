Hello,
can anyone suggest me a proper way how to schedule UDP packets to transmit at
some given rate?
E.g., I have two boxes both having 10 GE interfaces. One box is able to
transmit at 9.9Gbps, the other one is able to receive only at about 5.5Gbps.
Flow control must be turned off for some other reason.
How can I put delay between subsequent msg sends to achieve desired
packet rate without loses, e.g., 3.5Gbps without bursts? Even nanosleep()
with the lowest possible delay seems to be too much delay. Busy loop with
clock_gettime(3) works OK on SMP boxes, but on UP it causes problems.
