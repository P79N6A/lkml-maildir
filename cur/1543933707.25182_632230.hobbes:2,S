Subject: [PATCH 07/11] writeback: requeue_io() on redirtied inode
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Redirtied inodes could be seen in really fast writes.
They should really be synced as soon as possible.
redirty_tail() could delay the inode for up to 30s.
Kill the delay by using requeue_io() instead.
