and how does that again make things bisectable in the middle of the PAT 
queue? For example if i undo:

in the PAT series, the rest of PAT wont apply. The proper approach is to 
do incremental updates to the existing codebase, i.e. truly base CPA 
ontop of PAT.
about whitespaces:

it's a revert barrier (within v2.6.25), so it would be nicer and more 
maintainable to integrate the whitespace changes into your patches, via 
the method i suggested. (it can even be scripted up)
