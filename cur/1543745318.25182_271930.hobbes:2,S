I just came across this today after burning backups to dvd-r.  The file that
caused the problem is 2,471,265,365 bytes.  After searching a little bit
I found that the kernel doesn't like the size even though it's valid (That
is from what I read).  So I did this:
--- inode.c-old	2004-11-17 17:50:51.000000000 -0500
+++ inode.c	2004-11-17 17:57:44.000000000 -0500

It seems to work for me, but I would like to know if doing this might cause
problems.  The large file is a tar.gz.  After doing the above modification
and loading the module, I ran gzip -t on the file.  gzip reported the file
was ok.  With out doing "inode->i_size &= 0xFFFFFFFF", I noticed that the
file size was 18446744071885849685 (0xFFFFFFFF934C8455)
