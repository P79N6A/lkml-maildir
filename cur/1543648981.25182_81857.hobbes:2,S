Greetings,
I hadn't had time to build/test kernels since 2.5.8-pre3.  I now find that 
loadlin doesn't work on my box any more.  Is this a known problem?  If so, 
when did it quit working?  (loadlin obsolete?  other?)
At the moment, the only way I have to boot is via floppy.
	tia for any tips,
	-Mike
