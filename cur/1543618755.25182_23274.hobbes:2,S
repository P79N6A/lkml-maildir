Hi Daniel! Hi List!
I tried the Athlon patch and when I enabled acpi instead of apm
I get kernel freezes, nothing works, not even Sysrq, nothing in the
log file.
It happened one while playing a avi with mplayer and once while playing
mp3 with xmms.
Live1024 Soundcard.
I used the implementation of acpi in the kernel 2.4.18.7 and not the
one from intel pages, because it didn't compile (missing asm/acpi.h,
other problems).
Best wishes
Norbert
