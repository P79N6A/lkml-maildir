I have upgraded to 2.4.9 and NFS no longer works for me. I get
---------------------------------------------------------------
NFS: NFSv3 not supported.
nfs warning: mount version older than kernel
---------------------------------------------------------------
even though I upgraded to the most recent version of util-linux 
(2.11h) and when reading certain files programs lock up and the kernel
prints out the following messages:
nfs: server node4 not responding, still trying
nfs: server node4 not responding, still trying
However, node4 is fine (I can telnet in it) and seems to work ok. 
(node4 is running 2.4.7, with knfsd).
No oopses, etc..
