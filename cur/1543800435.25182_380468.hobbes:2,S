In fact neither of these patches helps, because these RCU callbacks run
from a tasklet in softirq context, and softirqs are not preemptible
(unless they are running in threads, see below):

Fortunately softirq preemption is one of the simplest parts of the -rt
patch - since the kernel already runs all softirqs in threads under
heavy load, it's simply a matter of adding a .config option to always do
that.
Linus, would you accept CONFIG_PREEMPT_SOFTIRQS to always run softirqs
in threads (default N of course, it certainly has a slight throughput
cost) for mainline if Ingo were to submit it?
