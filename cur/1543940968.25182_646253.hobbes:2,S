the only real issue i remember in this area are hidden link dependencies 
in terms of ordering init sequences.
and there's just no other sane approach here but to do finegrained 
changes (so that any breakage remains bisectable) and take the plunge 
down that road. Any implicit link dependency is a bug in the waiting 
anyway, which we want to fix. So feel free to unify this area, whenver 
you find the time.
