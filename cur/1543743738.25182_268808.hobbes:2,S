Subject: [PATCH] Check character flags in ppp_async ldisc
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/11/6/8

Although it was checking the per-character error flags supplied by the
driver for ordinary characters, the ppp_async line discipline code
wasn't checking the flags for special characters, such as the flag and
escape characters (~ and }).  This patch adds that check.
