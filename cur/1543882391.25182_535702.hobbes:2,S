Very interesting indeed but fairly complicated as well.

I thought that the effective "timeslice" on CFS was double the 
sched_granularity_ns so wouldn't this make the effective timeslice double 
that of what you're setting SD to? Anyway the difference between 400 and 
800ms timeslices is unlikely to be significant so I don't mind.
