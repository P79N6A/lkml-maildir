My goal was to not change any behaviour from our current code, and from
what I can tell, our current code does not support PM suspend and resume
for old external-local-APIC machines. (They're mostly 486 MPs, right?)
The suspend/resume procedures only work on P6/K7 and up. There's a
bug there in that we may try to run the suspend on a UP P5 with enabled
local APIC, which won't work. So far, no one seems to have noticed :->
(Admittedly, the P5 errata sheets say "BIOS should disable the P5 local
APIC on UP" so I don't think this case is very likely.)
