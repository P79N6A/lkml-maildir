There are some -dj specific hacks to dcache.c to convert to use
list_t types. Which from memory, I think William Lee Irwin did.
(wli, can you double check those just in case there's either an
 obvious thinko, or a mismerge if you get time ?)
Failing that, this could be something that also affects mainline
I think.
