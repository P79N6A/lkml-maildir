ok, i've got something better to test: i separated the delta out into a 
more finegrained stack of 3 patches. You can pick them up from:
 
http://redhat.com/~mingo/cfs-scheduler/older/sched-cfs-v2-rc0.patch
 
http://redhat.com/~mingo/cfs-scheduler/older/sched-cfs-v2-rc0-preempt-fix.patch
 
http://redhat.com/~mingo/cfs-scheduler/older/sched-cfs-v2-rc0-child-runs-first.patch
 
http://redhat.com/~mingo/cfs-scheduler/older/sched-cfs-v2-rc0-misc.patch
i test-built and test-booted all 4 steps of this. The baseline -v2-rc0 
patch should be the one that works - you might want to double-check it, 
just to be sure. One of the other 3 patches ontop of this baseline 
causes the regression on your desktop. My current bet is on preempt-fix, 
so i have put that one first. The other one would be the second patch, 
child-runs-first. The misc patch should have no effect on behavior - but 
i've included it for completeness. (and i was wrong about the 'nice 
fix', it is not in this delta)
