What doesn't work? We have a bunch of machines that boot diskless.
zebigbos:~> cat /proc/version 
Linux version 2.6.15 (erik@zebigbos) (gcc version 3.4.2) #1 SMP Tue Jan 17 11:02:22 CET 2006

As far as I can remember we haven't had any problems in this area for

This machine does have a slightly newer ethernet controller: 
0000:02:07.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation 82546GB Gigabit Ethernet Controller (rev 03)
0000:02:07.1 Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation 82546GB Gigabit Ethernet Controller (rev 03)
