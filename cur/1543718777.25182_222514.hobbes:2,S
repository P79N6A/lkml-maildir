Ok,
 looks like somebody has bought into the sign-off procedure. Great.
Except that I (and my tools) expected for the "Signed-off-by:" line to go
into the comment section _before_ the patch (and after the "explanation")
and obviously didn't make that part very clear.
The reason for that is partly because that's how all the current source
control helper tools work by extracting the changeset comments (but that
could certainly be changed), but more importantly because with a large
patch, it's very very easy to overlook the sign-off at the end of the
patch.
I only noticed after I applied this, so now you didn't get the distinction 
of being the first changeset ever to have the sign-off thing recorded ;^)
.. and the race is on.
(Seriously, while nobody has actually complained about the suggested
rules, I don't think anybody should feel compelled to do the sign-off
before we've had more time to let people argue over it. People who feel 
comfortable with the suggestion are obviously encouraged to start asap, 
though).
