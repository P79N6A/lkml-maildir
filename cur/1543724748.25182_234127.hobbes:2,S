An interesting idea:
The slab caches are object caches. If a rcu user only needs a valid 
object but doesn't care which one then there is no need to wait for a 
quiescent cycle after free - the quiescent cycle can be delayed until 
the destructor is called.
But there are two flaws in your patch:
- you must disable poisoning and unmapping if SLAB_DESTROY_BY_RCU is set.
- either delay the dtor calls a well or fail if an object has a non-NULL 
dtor and SLAB_DESTROY_BY_RCU is set.
