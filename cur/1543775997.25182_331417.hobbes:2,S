You must have have dealt with many patent lawyers.  I have, and they
operate in a league of their own on how to intrepret the english
language in patent claims :)

I was "advised" to not do so, until the parties that were complaining
about the change, had time to convert their code.  They then did so, and
so, a number of MONTHS later, I did a rewrite of the code, which caused
me to create new functions and delete old, non-used functions.  Those
new functions were marked with the EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL mark, as ALL of the
driver core functions are.  This change had lived in the -mm tree for a
number of months now, with no objections.

Thanks for doing so.
