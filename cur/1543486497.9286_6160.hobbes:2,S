Not everywhere. In school, there's ultra sparc running linux, which is
dodgy (because it is running experimental SMP kernel and because it
gets rather high load and because it has much too many disks and
because linux's SCSI layer has problems with error recovery, etc,
etc.) and which has 150G (do I remember correctly?) of disks.
It is ftp mirror. On ftp mirror, you don't care about data being
lost. If they are, they can be retrieved again. But fsck times are
killing that machine.

I might say something very stupid, but is not fsync() one of ways to
ensure consistency? Yes, it speed sucks...
