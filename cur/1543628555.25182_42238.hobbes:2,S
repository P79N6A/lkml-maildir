Hi,
why is a there a experimental VLAN option in the stable 2.4.x-kernel, when it's useless without patching Network Drivers?
Why isn't there a solution for all network drivers to accept frames 4 bytes longer on request of e.g. vconfig (like ifconfig setting promiscious mode on/off) ? Or to deny vconfig to add a vlan, if the network driver/hardware doesn't support this?
Today the situation is as follows: The experimental VLAN-option is useless, if i dont patch my network drivers, otherwise there is no working VLAN function.
Any future plans?
