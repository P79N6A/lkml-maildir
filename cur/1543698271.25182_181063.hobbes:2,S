Under Windows, the Promise driver, that you loaded, assumes that they are 
being used as a RAID controller.  If you unload the driver, you can use the 
two IDE channels as IDE channels under Windows 2000 and Windows XP.

Repeat after me... Hardware raid is smart, wonderful, and expensive.  Software 
raid is cheap, the controller card is dumb, and is what people put on 
motherboards, and inexpensive controller cards.
There are two IDE controller channels on the Promise RAID controller card, a 
bios chip, and not much else.  They have no processor.
The bios is only used for booting, since the operating system drivers aren't 
loaded yet.  Once booted, the Windows driver pretends it is a hardware Raid, 
by using software in the driver (I.E. Software Raid).  Linux uses the md 
driver to map access to the of drives, which it makes into a Raid set (I.E. 
Software Raid).

A hardware Raid card is a complete computer, that happens to plug into your 
PCI bus, and it has a software Raid driver.  It frequently costs more than 
the motherboard it is plugged in to.
