can we thus take this as a retraction of your below quoted three
derogatory comments?
" The entire Linux Network subsystem needs an overhaul. "
" In networking, the enemy is LATENCY for fast performance.  That's why
  NetWare can handle 5000 users and Linux barfs on 100 in similiar tests.  
  Copying increases latency, and the long code paths in the Linux Network
  layer. "
" Alan, Please.  I'm in your code and there are copies all over the
  place.  I agree you have a "fast path" for most stuff, but there's all
  kinds of handles lookups, linear list searching like
  while (x)
  {
    x = x->next
  }
 
  all over the place that increases latency. "
