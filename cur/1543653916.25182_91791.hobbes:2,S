- more flexibility, you get a lot for free from libfs.c and other parts of 
the kernel. Check how small the modfs example is, much more isn't needed.
- no extra syscalls needed, which might have to be emulated by 64bit 
system. Module objects are normal files, why waste a syscall if you can 
just write() them to the kernel?

The linker script will not go away, it makes the loader a _lot_ easier and 
I want to keep it this way. Multiple module_init() calls won't happen, 
don't even try it.

The user space locking should of course be a bit more intelligent than one 
big lock.

The kernel doesn't need the dependency information, they can stay as well 
in user space. The checks currently done don't have to be done in the 
kernel.

I want to keep the kernel implementation simple, this would only bloat it.
Cleaning up after a signal shouldn't bother the kernel (at least as far 
as modfs is concerned).

The point of the linker script is to avoid that the loader has to play 
around with the sections. If you want to get rid of init data, put it at 
the end and truncate() it when you're done. This is trivial to do with a 
module fs.

You're trying to move your problems to someone else - very bad idea.
If you can't get modules references right, you have very likely more 
problems like module initialization races. Link everything together and 
make the initialization explicit and don't rely on that the linker/loader 
gets it magically right.
