Only problem is that this message is printed only once for each IRQ, so
you cannot get more than 16 of them... Watch ERR counter in /proc/interrupts,
it is still increasing, although message is not printed. On my A7V (KT133,
Thunderbird) there are about 3 spurious IRQ7 per 1000 irqs delivered from
onboard Promise IDE (and ide driver does not complain about timeouts, so
I assume that IRQ from IDE is delivered AND spurious IRQ7 is delivered). 
Unfortunately I do not have anything else in the computer, so I cannot 
check whether KT133 or Promise is a culprit, but from other messages it 
looks like that Promise is innocent, and VIA is guilty one.
                                            Best regards,
