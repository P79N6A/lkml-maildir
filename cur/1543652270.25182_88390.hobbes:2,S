Hi all !
i want merge the linux driver for FC controllers from Qlogic and 
Emulex (All series from both) into the kernel tree, because i need 
this for our company.
Qlogic is clear GPL but Emulex have no GPL. 
I think the license to use the code is free and i see no problems. 
Anyone else working with this stuff or any hints ?
greetings
Daniel
