I don't think so.  Once we know what subarch it is we can do a specific
hypervisor call if we need to for early printing.  There are weird
issues like physical vs virtual that would seem to make anything more
generic very difficult to get right, because the code pointed at
would need to be fully pic.
So as a trivial hypervisor call certainly, but I'm pretty doubtful
about a function pointer.  
Then we can do:
if (xen)
   blah
else if (lguest)
   blah2
