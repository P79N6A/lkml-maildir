well, there's one security consequence here - module loading
(request_module()), which spawns a kernel thread must not run as
SCHED_BATCH. I think the right solution for that path is to set the policy
to SCHED_OTHER upon entry, and restore it to the previous one afterwards -
this way the helper thread has SCHED_OTHER priority.
