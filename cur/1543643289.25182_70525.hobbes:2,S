	Well, it is probably not IDE-related at all, but rather it has
something to do with PCI or may be scheduling changes that -pre2-ac2 does.
Currently I positively know that 2.4.20-pre2 works, but 2.4.20-ac2 and
2.4.20-pre5 does not. I have tested 2.4.20-pre2-ac1 and 2.4.20-pre[34],
but all these does not work for me probably for some other reason.
	So I have taken patch-2.4.20-pre2-ac2, and deleted all
changes except the ones that are IDE-related, and 2.4.20-pre2 plus the
following parts of -pre2-ac2 works:

	I have to delete the first chunk of the patch of
include/asm-i386/ide.h, and I have deleted the call to
pci_enable_device_bars() in drivers/ide/ide-pci.c to be able to compile
this, but other than that it is exactly the same as 2.4.20-pre2-ac2 IDE code.
I will send you this as a patch against 2.4.20-pre2 if you want.
	This still works, so it means the problem has to be in some other
part of 2.4.20-pre2-ac2.
