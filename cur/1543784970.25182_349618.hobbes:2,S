hmmm ... yes, I'm wrong, it works (or should) in the existing code.
I don't know what I was thinking.
Though we still have problems with scsi_report_lun_scan code like:
                } else if (lun > sdev->host->max_lun) {
max_lun just has to be large, at least greater than 0xc001 (49153), maybe
even 0xffffffff, correct?
But then some sequential scanning could take a while. Maybe the above
check is not needed.
lpfc has max_luns set to 256, with max limited to 32768, I don't know how
it could be working OK here. (Has James S or anyone tested this?)
Probably similar for qlogic and maybe other non-SPI transports (though
current qlogic max_luns is 65535, gets us to ff ff 00 00 00 00 00 00).

OK.
