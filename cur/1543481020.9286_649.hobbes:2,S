Hi,
The recent changes in ESSxxxx soundcard code have broken first the
detection (pre-7 I _think_ but not sure, didn't notice it until
yesterday) and with pre-8 there is no sound anymore.
My soundcard is some oddball cheapo ESS968+1688 pnp thing, but it's been
working ok (other than midi getting detected but doesn't work unless I
boot first into Dos but that's not a big deal) The new code detects my
ESS968 as ESS1888 (cat /proc/sound from pre-8 to follow) Pre-7 looks the
same except for the (DUPLEX) -part and works, although the chip is
misdetected.
I'll be happy to test patches if anyone got some...
