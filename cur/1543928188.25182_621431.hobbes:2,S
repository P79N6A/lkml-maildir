The patch below is a little ugly but will allow allyesconfig to work.  I
don't know enough about the Realtek devices to make intellegent
suggestions on how to fix this particular problem.  Clearly the 2
drivers share a lot of common code so perhaps they can be merged?
I assumed that the RTL8180, is still somewhat WiP based on the commit
message for a2645795713c4374ff2efda960251cdc30b63430 (wireless-2.6.git).
Appologies for the uber long CC line, wasn't sure who can be pruned.
From: Tony Breeds <tony@bakeyournoodle.com>
Temporarily ensure that Realtek 8185 and 8187 aren't compiled together.
These two drivers share a number of common (global) functions.  While RTL8180
is still being worked on ensure that it's not built together with the RTL8187
(ie allyseconfig).
