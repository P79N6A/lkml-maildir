Ahhah, but you miss the point.
The fork()'ed child may clone on its own, and then exit. In which case we 
sure as heck don't want the original child to modify the VM that it now 
shares with a subthread.
This is just more on my spiel about how only the _parent_ really knows 
what it is it wants to maintain, and the child really cannot make any 
assumptions on its own.
