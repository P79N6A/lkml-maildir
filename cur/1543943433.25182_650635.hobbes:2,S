That is indeed horrible code. No way will I merge anything that has things 
like that even in it's *history* (ie somebody needs to re-generate the 
tree without code like that - some things should not be allowed to exist).
That said, while just using "probe_kernel_addr()" is certainly much 
better, it's still really inefficient. If you actually want to do a "safe 
memory copy", then the right way to do that is basically to do
	pagefault_disable();
	leftover = __copy_from_user_inatomic(dst, src, count);
	pagefault_enable();
	if (leftover)
		handle_the_fact_that_the_copy_didnt_complete();
which should even be reasonably efficient and should work in all contexts 
(hardware interrupts disabled, spinlocks held, you name it).
So all those "kgdb_{get|set}_mem()" things seem bogus (they also have 
insane calling semantics - return NULL or errptr? Why not just return an 
integer error code?
