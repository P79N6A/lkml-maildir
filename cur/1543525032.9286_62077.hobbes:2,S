Hi,
	May be basic, but i would like to know whether the switching
between two kernel processes ( those which are created by using
kernel_thread()) is faster than the switching between two user level
processes(those which are created by using fork())?. Is there any
advantage for kernel processes?
Thanks in advance
Hari
