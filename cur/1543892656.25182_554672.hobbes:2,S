Hm, I tried fixing this up by hand, but there is one major thing that I
think you need to change so I'll ask you to do it:

Just put the .h stuff into the file, you don't need a separate file.

All of these need to be static, and you can just reorganize where you
put them in the file to prevent the need for forward declarations.

This is scary, more below about this...

Wrong codeing style for this whole if/else chain.

this is the big problem.  You are modifying a structure that is static
and should be read-only.  What happens if you have a system with more
than one type of these devices in it?  What happens then?
The proper way to do this is just use the calc_num_ports() callback
function in the usb_serial_driver structure.  That's where you can
calculate the proper number of ports for this device if you need to.  Or
you might need to do it in the probe() function of the usb_serial_driver
structure instead, depending on what you really need to do here.
So, can you fix this up and resend it?

Heh, no typedefs please, just use __u16 here for where you used this
type (it's only 2 functions.)

tabs instead of leading spaces?

Tab before the 3?
