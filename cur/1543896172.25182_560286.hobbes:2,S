no, the GPL protected rights don't say anything about the hardware the 
system runs on.
you are saying that the GPL now controls what the BIOS software is allowed 
to do or not allowed to do.
that's a seperate body of code that is in no way derived from the linux 
kernel (even the anti-tampering functions would work equally well with 
other Operating systems and are in no way linux specific). it's no even 
loaded on the same media (the BIOS is in flash/rom on the botherboard, the 
OS is on the hard drive)
and note that the software that is checked to make sure that it hasn't 
been changed includes much more then the kernel. it checks the kernel and 
the initrd.

newer models do tend to be more restrictive, but they also tend to connect 
to more propriatary networks (satellite or cable)
