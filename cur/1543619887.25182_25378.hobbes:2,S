By fallback I mean't just for the tail, not the whole file.
I have been there before. I had to implement the mixed mode buffered/direct
I/O on Unicos because a change in underlying disk subsystems stopped
customer applications from working - the allowed boundaries for
O_DIRECT stopped working when the sales people sold them some new
disks. This also meant you could get most of the speed benefits of
O_DIRECT without having to align your I/O, it also meant really
large I/Os could be made to automatically bypass cache to avoid
cache thrashing.
What we had were two flags, one which indicated use direct I/O, and another
which indicated return an error to user space rather than go through 
buffers.
So lie to me and make it work, or don't lie to me options I suppose.

I suspect the reason XFS never did small files in the inode was because of
the problems with implementing mmap and O_DIRECT.
