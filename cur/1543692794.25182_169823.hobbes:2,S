You meant linux, right?  Agreed.

I share your doubts.  Considering that the header files only rarely
cause problems, some hundred hits sound a bit too much.  Also, this
should be extended to also warn on unnecessary headers being included,
so it drives us both ways.  But then again, this is not important
enough to me right now to spend too much time on it.
