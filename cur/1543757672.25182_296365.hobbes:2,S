That's because your partition isn't a full 4kB in size.
So the kernel falls back to 512-byte reads, just because they are the only 
kind that _can_ read the last sector.

Note: this is a nice multiple of 4kB.

And note how this is _not_ (see the "+" at the end), you've got a 
1023983.5 kB partition.

But it seems to end in an odd number of sectors.
That said, I'm surprised that the difference in performance is _that_ 
large. Regardless of whether the disk blocksize is 512 bytes or 4096 
bytes, you should be getting IO merging - it might use more CPU time, but 
the actual IO should still be done in much larger blocks.
You should be able to try the BLKBSZSET ioctl to set the blocksize by hand 
if you want to try it out:
	int size = 4096;
	ioctl(fd, BLKBSZSET, &size);
or similar. Of course, mounting a filesystem on the device tends to do 
that (or undo it) for you, ie it will set the blocksize to whatever 
blocksize the filesystem wants.
