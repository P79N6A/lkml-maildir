Hrm... I wonder why I posted from my IBM address :-) I have no firm
preference on the name of the structure. So far, I had no feedback on
that patch at all appart from yours though.
Andrew, Greg ? Is that something you would take for 2.6.20 ? I need to
know wether I should rework my patches to use that or stick to my hacks
involving hijacking firmware_data.
Cheers,
Ben.
