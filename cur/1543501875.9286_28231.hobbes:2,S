I have a test system (SMP even) that I am using just to build and run
2.3.x to help you guys get some feedback and I notice this if I try to use
Debian's package manager to install a package:
dpkg: error processing procps_2.0.2-2.deb (--install):
 unable to fsync updated status of `procps': Input/output error
dpkg: error while cleaning up:
 unable to fsync updated status of `procps': Input/output error
It will SOMETIMES work and it will SOMETIMES report this error. Error rate
is about 50% of the times I run dpkg.
Not a big issue, this is not an important machine, just wanting to send
some feedback to the developers.
