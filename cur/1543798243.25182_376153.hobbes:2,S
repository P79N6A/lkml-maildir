It's harder in your case because the tasklet is created each time it's 
scheduled again, as far as I see it in your impleemntation.
Each SPI controller thread is created only once so it's more lightweight 
than what you do.

Okay, not a major issue though. Change mutexes to 
spin_lock_irq/spin_unlock_irq and it's callable from an interrupt 
context, right?
