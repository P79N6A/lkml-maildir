I wrote in my unusual_devices.h source:
/* Marek Michalkiewicz - needed at least for revisions 0015 and 0113 */
UNUSUAL_DEV(  0x07c4, 0xa400, 0x0000, 0xffff,
              "Datafab",
              "KECF-USB",
              US_SC_SCSI, US_PR_BULK, NULL,
              US_FL_FIX_INQUIRY ),
and
/* aeb - needed at least for revision 0100 */
UNUSUAL_DEV( 0x090c, 0x1132, 0x0000, 0xffff,
                "Feiya",
                "5-in-1 Card Reader",
                US_SC_SCSI, US_PR_BULK, NULL,
                US_FL_FIX_CAPACITY ),
If some revision has a certain property then most likely a later revision
has the same property. We maximize the chances that someone's device
will work out of the box by making the range as large as possible.
But document in the source what precisely is needed, so that if we
find a later revision without the quirk, the limits can be adapted.
