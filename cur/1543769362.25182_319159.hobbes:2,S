With a realtime scheduler and properly written drivers (no "schedule"  
gaps) you'll reach same results. For x86 we use special instructions like
xchg and locking-free algorithm in dmix, so the latency is SAME for all 
concurent apps with minimal overhead..

Yes, but having the code which computes something in interrupt is not 
sane.

You need to write complete new virtual layer or use a new special driver 
which connect to real soundcard. Thats a lot of new code - it's better to 
do it safely in the user space.

Why X drivers aren't in kernel, too? Because they're big and kernel should
drive the real bottom of hardware (interrupts, DMA, memory mapping), but
abstraction (which sound mixing _IS_) should be implemented in the user 
space. Otherwise we will end up with a huge kernel implementing nearly 
everything...

You can obtain all necessary info in the userspace as well.
We should definitely fix the dmix bugs. Or, if you want, you might buy
an accelerated soundcard which supports multiple streams in hardware.
