The number of interrupt sources on a system ends up scaling this up to
numerous IO-APIC RTE reprograms and ioapic_lock acquisitions per-second
(granted, with a 5s timeout between reprogramming storms) where it
competes against IO-APIC interrupt acknowledgements.
Making the lock per- IO-APIC would at least put a bound on the number
of competitors mutually interfering with each other, but a tighter
bound on the amount of work than NR_IRQS would be more useful than that.
