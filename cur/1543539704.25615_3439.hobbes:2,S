This is a simple patch to allow the use of offsets when writing to proc files. I don't know if it is
really needed but it seems correct, and I needed it for a module I was writing.
This patch was created with 2.4.0-test5-pre3 and also applied fine to 2.4.0-test5-pre4.
I believe I caught all uses of this function but since this is my first kernel patch, it would be
nice if someone more knowledgeable would double check.
