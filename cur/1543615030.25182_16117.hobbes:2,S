If it shouldn't be used, it should be removed from the structure to force
people to change.
This is probably why usb-storage broke, and it wasn't obvious to me what
went wrong.
So now I guess I need to either (a) compute the address for the USB layer,
or (b) figure out how to pass the memory parameters directly, so we can use
highmem.
