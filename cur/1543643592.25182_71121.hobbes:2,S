I had a patch in the Daleki 2.5 IDE which would easily allow for
alternative descriptions to be added with very little pain.
The patch was really trivial, and converted the code that gives
these messages into a data structure instead.  (A good balance
between data structures and code is an important point IMHO.)
However, due to the method by which Martins stuff was ripped out
of the kernel, its going to be pretty hard for me to recover the
patch.  I was hoping BK might help here, but it doesn't appear
to.
