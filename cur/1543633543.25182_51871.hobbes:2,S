Oh lets just comment and delete the whole driver.
Everyone knows I am the king of tosser code and driver writing.
Everyone knows that I am a fraud and clear can not write a storage driver.
Surely it has to be the Maintainer's fault, because everyone is capable of
installing hardware and getting connection correct.  Nobody ever buy cheap
crappy mainboards, cause they do not exist.  Obviously the hardware is
always perfect, and the code is pathetic an whoafully buggy and I should
just quit attempting to be something I can't.
Well, I am damn close to orphaning the driver.
Maybe we should just copy 2.5 back into 2.4 and be done!
