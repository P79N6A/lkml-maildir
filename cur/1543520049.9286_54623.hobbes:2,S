Well said.  However, if The Poster is simply too lazy
to write a message in such a way as to render it easily
comprehensible to its recipients, then I consider that
more insulting than a simple, if somewhat insensitive
misunderstanding.
I found Raster's posts hard to read, because they were
under-punctuated, under-capitalised and badly mistyped
in a way that led me to believe that he was not having
trouble spelling, but merely that he valued his time and
effort in making a legible message over that of the L-K
subscribers who expended considerable effort in deciphering
it.  That being the case, it's no better than posting
untrimmed, unwrapped, jeapordy-quoted HTML asking about
ncurses.
I publicly apologise in advance if I have misrepresented
anyone.
Matthew.
