You just need to add SET_STREAMINIG as a write-safe command, then it
will work as a regular user. Hmm, it is already added as write safe. You
don't have write permission on the device, then.

The 'scsi' in the name doesn't refer to the transport used, but the
command set being scsi-like. ide-scsi emulation has nothing to do with
it.

Just fix the permission on the special file. Additionally, the program
must open the device O_RDWR.
