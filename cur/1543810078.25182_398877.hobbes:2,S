it's not (at least among general Linux users, it probably is among alsa 
developers).
Especially after the comments that Linus made a few months ago about how 
important it is to not break userspace interfaces.

but people frequently upgrade kernels on existing machines so they aren't 
after new drivers.
if alsalib really needs to be upgraded in lockstep with the kernel then it 
should be included with the kernel (and it still leaves people in trouble 
when they need to shift back and forth between two different kernels, how 
do you select the alsalib version to use on boot to make it match the 
kernel you booted from?)

There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.
