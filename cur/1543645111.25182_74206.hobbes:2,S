# [PATCH] fix compares of jiffies
# 
# on rechecking the current stable kernel code, I found some places where jiffies
# were compared in a way that seems to break when they wrap. For these,
# I made up patches to use the macros "time_before()" or "time_after()"
# that are supposed to handle wraparound correctly.
