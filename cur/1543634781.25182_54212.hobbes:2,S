AmitR> strategy for "large disc simulator" , if you have planned it
What I did was create a fake scsi device based on the HP simulator for
IA64, backed by a sparse file.  So it's really a loop device that
obeys SCSI commands.  It worked back on 2.5.9, but the changes since
then mean it deadlocks immediately now --- I intend to fix it, and
release it as soon as I can make some time.
The purpose was to test the SCSI layer's response to large discs.
What I'm trying to test now is what happens with real discs. 
I found that ext2 has too much metadata for the amount of disc space I
have for the sparse file approach to work.  JFS worked very well.
Reiserfs doesn't work at present, but I sent the bug report to them,
and they're working on the problems.
The testing I'm doing is:
    1.  Is the size of the drive reported correctly by the kernel?
	-- at bootup
	-- via ioctl(GETBLKSIZE)
	-- via ioctl(GETBLKSIZE64)
	-- via lseek(,0, SEEK_END)
    2.  Can the drive be partitioned?
        I expect Gnu parted with GDT to work properly; I expect the
	others to fail gracefully
    3.  Can a file system be written to the drive?
        I've been testing ext2, jfs and reiserfs;
	I tested XFS on an earlier patch, but at present it's too much
	of a pain to integrate.
    4.  If a filesystem is created, does fsck work?
    5.  Can the filesystem be mounted?
    6.  Then test how large a file I can create on the filesystem,
        both sparse and full.
