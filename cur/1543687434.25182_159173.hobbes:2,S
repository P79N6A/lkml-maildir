Subject: 2.6.0: module char_10_135

During boot-up, and just after the setting the clock line, noticed the
following line:
modeprobe: FATAL: module char_10_135 not found
First noticed this a few revisions ago. The contents of directory
/lib/modules/2.6.0-test3-bk8/kernel/drivers/char:
agp/  genrtc.ko  hw_random.ko  lp.ko  rtc.ko
hmm, long shot, but perhaps this bug is related to not auto-loading
module lp?
