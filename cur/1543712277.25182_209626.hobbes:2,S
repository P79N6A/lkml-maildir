Yes - I see where the input argument 'mask' is assigned to 'work_mask',
and then 'work_mask' is manipulated during the loops.
But inside the last loop of cheetah_xcall_deliver(), after 'mask' has
been read the last time to initialize 'work_mask', it is repeatedly
updated with the lines:
					if ((dispatch_stat & check_mask) == 0)
						cpu_clear(i, mask);
Why, why?  Can't these two lines just be _removed_?
What earthly purpose does that 'cpu_clear(i, mask)' have?
That copy of 'mask' will never be used again, at least not that I can see.
There's even a comment a few lines above, seemingly related to this:
			/* Clear out the mask bits for cpus which did not
			 * NACK us.
			 */
But that doesn't address the "why".
And then, if these two lines can be removed for lack of affect, the six
lines just before, that setup 'check_mask', can go too, also for lack of
any remaining affect.
That would be eight lines of dead code, with three lines of commentary.
Sorry - I must be missing something somewhere.
