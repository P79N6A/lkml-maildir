How would I know? :) "The standard thing".
I shuffled a bit in the source code and the word 'order' is quite often 
around 'barrier', so I thought the 'barrier' option makes the IO 
scheduler strictly ordered, that is, write log first, then data. (like 
ext3's data=ordered). Anyhow, just see below

So here are the results. I have run these tests from single-user mode (-b
bootflag) so that no other userspace programs would interfere.

A small nitpick BTW, the barrier flag is not listed in /proc/mounts.
hda is always in nobarrier mode.
<6>hda: cache flushes not supported
<6>hdc: cache flushes supported
<5>Filesystem "hda3": Disabling barriers, not supported by the underlying
device
hdc can do barriers if wanted.
CASE 1: Copying from one disk to another
========================================
Copying a compiled 2.6.17-rc4 tree; 306907 KB in 28566 files in 2090
directories.
15:33 (none):~ # cd /tmp
15:33 (none):/tmp # time rsync -PHSav kernel-source/ /D/kernel-0/ >/dev/null
real	7m31.776s
user	0m7.030s
sys	0m14.450s
I rebooted here (only here - no more reboots below) to get a cold slate.
15:42 (none):~ # mount /dev/hdc2 /D -o nobarrier
15:42 (none):/tmp # rsync -PHSav kernel-source/ /D/kernel-1/ >/dev/null
real	2m14.401s
user	0m7.290s
sys	0m14.900s
15:45 (none):/tmp # umount /D
CASE 2: Removing
================
Remove the copies we created in case 1.
15:45 (none):/tmp # mount /dev/hdc2 /D -o barrier
15:45 (none):/tmp # cd /D
15:45 (none):/D # time rm -Rf kernel-0
real	3m31.901s
user	0m0.050s
sys	0m3.140s
15:49 (none):/D # cd /
15:49 (none):/ # umount /D
15:49 (none):/ # mount /dev/hdc2 /D -o nobarrier
15:49 (none):/ # cd /D
15:49 (none):/D # time rm -Rf kernel-1
real	0m53.471s
user	0m0.070s
sys	0m1.990s
15:50 (none):/D # cd /
15:50 (none):/ # umount /D
CASE 3: Copying to the same disk
================================
Copy a file from hdc2 to hdc2. The result is _extremely_ interesting. So the
'barrier' thing is only relevant for large sets of files, it seems.
15:50 (none):/ # mount /dev/hdc2 /D -o barrier
15:50 (none):/ # cd /D/Video
15:50 (none):/D/Video # ls -l The*
-rw-r--r--  1 jengelh users 6861772800 Mar 17 23:02 TLK3.iso
15:50 (none):/D/Video # time cp TLK3.iso ../tlk-0.iso
real	8m1.051s
user	0m0.670s
sys	0m41.120s
15:59 (none):/D/Video # cd /
15:59 (none):/ # umount /D
15:59 (none):/ # mount /dev/hdc2 /D -o nobarrier
15:59 (none):/ # Kcd /D/Video
15:59 (none):/D/Video # time cp TLK3.iso ../tlk-1.iso
real	7m53.275s
user	0m0.560s

16:07 (none):/D/Video # cd /
16:08 (none):/ # umount /D
16:08 (none):/ # exit
