I have updated the patches to include a bugfix from Pavel Machek (thanks, Pavel!).
Affected are the "suspend" patch and the "consolidated" patch.  The updated patches
are available at:
http://www.sisk.pl/kernel/patches/2.6.11-rc2/swsusp-use-list-suspend-v3.patch
http://www.sisk.pl/kernel/patches/2.6.11-rc2/2.6.11-rc2-swsusp-use-list-v2.patch
respectively.  The other patches remain unchanged.
Greets,
Rafael
