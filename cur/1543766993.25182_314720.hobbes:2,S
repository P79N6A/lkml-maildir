At present I'm using your changed version, but that is wrong --- in most
cases, we want to return short writes on errors.  It's only in the
synchronous case that we want to do otherwise, and even then only on EIO
on the inode.  For example, if we run out of quota halfway through an
O_SYNC write beyond EOF, then the bulk of the IO *has* completed
successfully, and we want to indicate that in the error.  So I'll be
re-jigging that bit of the code.
Cheers,
 Stephen
