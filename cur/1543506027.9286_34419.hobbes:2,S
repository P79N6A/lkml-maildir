If you saw this, your kernel is truely crocked. 
There is no MILO for dp264 -- everyone must boot from SRM.  As such,
we always use dp264_srm_device_interrupt.  Which _is_ implemented.
In short, I have no idea how you could have gotten here. 
Oh, wait, yes I do -- a configuration error.  Did you select
CONFIG_ALPHA_DP264 (instead of CONFIG_ALPHA_GENERIC) and then
not select CONFIG_ALPHA_SRM?
