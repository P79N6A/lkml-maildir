I might look at that someday, but in the meanwhile we have broken
userspace in 2.6.28, and that needs to be sorted out first.
I'm still poking around, but haven't spotted anything obvious
from working kernel 2.6.27.xx to failing kernel 2.6.28.
One minor nit did show up, though.  The patch below
seems to make more sense than the code does without it.
