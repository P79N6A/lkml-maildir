Ah, this. Is this something that somebody is working on ? People have been
talking about Plan 9 name spaces for many years, but it seems that not too
much emerged from that.

Major 0, minor dynamically assigned. Fairly trivial to use with something
like the /proc/mount-devs I've proposed. As far as the device file is
concerned, you can either
 - create it on the fly (e.g. LILO does that if it doesn't find anything
   suitable in /dev)
 - populate /dev with unnamed0, unnamed1, etc.
 - get devfs to do all this for you (if you have devfs)
 - create a /proc/unnamed-dev/<number> virtual directory
Each of the solutions looks a bit hackish, but then maybe it's just a
question of getting used to it ;-)
