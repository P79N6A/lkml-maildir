Dear all:
I've downloaded 2.4.21 and patched it with con kolivas's patch v3 (patch-2.4.21-ck3.bz2). After compiling, the kernel doesn't boot:
first, it uncompresses linux kernel and after "Ok, booting the kernel" it hangs there forever. 
Im an experienced linux user but I've no idea how to track the source of a problem at this boot stage.
I've compiled it with gcc version 3.3.1 20030626 (Debian prerelease) and Im sending you my config.
Thanks in advance
