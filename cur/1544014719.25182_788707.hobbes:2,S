I think it does. The dmatest driver should definitely use
DMA_BIDIRECTIONAL on the destination buffer to ensure that the poison
values are written to RAM and not just written to cache and discarded.
Now, this probably means that the destination buffer must be _unmapped_
with DMA_BIDIRECTIONAL too, which is difficult to do with the current
asymmetrical API...
In the general case, however, I think MIPS has a bug: I've seen drivers
DMA to/from tiny buffers stored inside another struct. This is legal
because the driver can guarantee that the other fields in the struct
aren't accessed in the mean time, but any fields sharing a cacheline
with the buffer must be written back before the lines are invalidated.
