The bugzilla database tracks problems, whether they are fixed or not. 
 The errata list aims to be a quick (hopefully short) list of known 
fixes to problems.  Bugzilla also tracks all types of problems where the 
errata list will usually only contain fixes to major, blocking problems. 
 Basically I'm trying to keep a list that will help people quickly find 
the diffs against releases that will help them get up and running enough 
to test with.
Thanks,
Paul Larson
