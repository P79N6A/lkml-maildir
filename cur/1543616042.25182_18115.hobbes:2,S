Beta or stable release?

you are

I really can't know. But to me the results look interesting enough to 
give it a try on certain problem situations (like yours) to find out  
if it is any better than the stock version. If you and others can     
confirm that things get better then I have no real doubts that Marcelo
can pick it up.

Well, there is really nothing wrong with upgrading mainline kernels,  
as the are getting better with every release, so I would always       
suggest to take the releases up lets say a week after being out. Only 
your situation maybe can help to improve more, if you input some of   
your experiences in LKML with a patch like Martins. Feedback _is_     
required to find a solution to an existing problem.

Well, my suggestions: don't patch around too much, but try single     
patches on stock kernel and evaluate them here.
