I don't understand this. A module is linked into the running kernel, and
has access to all of it AFAIU, so I can't see any need for this contortion
for modules. Maybe I'm just plain blind today...
If it is really needed, some piece of magic should translate them to the
plain calls when they are not modules to get rid of the overhead.
