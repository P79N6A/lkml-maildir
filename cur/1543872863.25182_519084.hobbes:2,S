Use the SCSI SG_IO ioctl() with opcode=ATA_16,
which gives you access to the ATA Passthrough mechanism.
This will work for most ATA commands.
I already use it in hdparm and in some other utilities
for scanning/repairing drives.
A notable exeception are the READ/WRITE LONG opcodes,
which require an extra kernel patch from me,
awaiting merge into libata some year.
