Most Linux systems still run with a single CPU, so I would guess "most".
At least they cannot be ignored.
Also lots of apps simply rely on kernel thread for IO context. Aio is 
implemented in glibc using cloned threads. Other programs use them e.g.
to tolerate paging latencies on mmap'ed files or for sendfile. For that it 
makes sense to have a lot of threads per process on a single CPU, even on 
a big multi CPU machine.
