I know this, but the in-kernel stuff is far less painful than when all this 
stuff bleeds to userland.  Besides, can you imagine such a beast of a 
module? :D  I mean yeouch, the maintenance.  And it'd encourage the sort of 
thing we as kernel developers in general want to discourage, which is the 
use of deprecated APIs.
Lots of things still out there depend on devfs.  So now if I want to 
develop my kmod on recent kernels I have to be in the business of 
maintaining a lot more userland stuff, like mkinitrd, installers, etc. that 
have come to rely on devfs.
The point is this is happening in what is being called a stable kernel. 
Stable it isn't.  The whole devfs thing is likely to cause me a lot of 
work, I'd stay with 2.4 in the worst affected things, but I can't.  devfs 
is newish for and already been deprecated and killed before a major release 
even, that just seems not right.
Anyway hopefully this thread wills tart some constructive thought on this 
rather than being pointless, but I had to get it out there.  I know I have 
a habit of showing up every other year or so. :)
