yes... 256MB/s is a bit too high!
Can you try with "fadvice" installed?
Anyway I think your theroy is right... and so intalling "fadvice" you will 
NOT see any big difference.

Yes, the correct way to work is as you say....
BUT read the whole story:
1) using "hdparm -t /dev/hda" I found IDE performace regression (in 
sequential reads) upgrading from 2.6.0 to 2.6.1-rc1
2) someone tell me to try to revert this patch:
"readahead: multiple performance fixes"
Reverting it in 2.6.1-rc1 kernel gives me the same ide performaces that 
2.6.0 has.
3) Since 2.6.0 and 2.6.1-rc1(with "readahead: multiple performance fixes" 
reverted) kernels give me the same results for any IDE performance test I 
do --> I treat them as they are the same thing ;-) 
The part of the patch that gives me all these problem is already found and 
is quite small:
