No, you're not crazy, you're right:
#define __GFP_DMA       0x01
#define __GFP_HIGHMEM   0x02
/* Action modifiers - doesn't change the zoning */
#define __GFP_WAIT      0x10    /* Can wait and reschedule? */
#define __GFP_HIGH      0x20    /* Should access emergency pools? */
#define __GFP_IO        0x40    /* Can start physical IO? */
#define __GFP_FS        0x80    /* Can call down to low-level FS? */
#define __GFP_COLD      0x100   /* Cache-cold page required */
#define __GFP_NOWARN    0x200   /* Suppress page allocation failure warning */
bits 3-6 of gfp masks are totally unused.
