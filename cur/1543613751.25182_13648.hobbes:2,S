GRUB 0.90 does this today. All other bootloaders could also do it quite
easily, since this is just an extension of what they have to do for the
kernel and initrd images.

I see this as cruft elimination. By adding a kernel linker (which can be
discarded after init) it allows one to increase the modularity of the kernel
- without using an initrd. Heck, you could make the initrd code
modularizable ;-)

Yes, but this isn't an absolute rule. IIRC that rule also has an "unless it
makes things a lot simpler" clause, too.

These examples are either a direct result of initrd complexities, or not
related.
Initrd exists to allow a two-phase startup. My point is that why have a 2
phase startup when you can have a 1 phase startup? Also, I'm not advocating
ditching the initrd capability, but wouldn't bootloading modules be
preferable for the majority of the systems currently using initrd out of
necessity?
