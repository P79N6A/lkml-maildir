o good idea, handy for when CONFIG_PROCFS not defined, or procfs.o
  module not available
o should be implemented on other platforms too
o should not duplicate procfs code (ie. have procfs call your code)
o should include support for other platforms
o should provide all the information that /proc/cpuinfo provides.
  maybe have a 0-element array at the end of the structure, and
  have an unbounded text area follow the bounded cpuinfo struct.
