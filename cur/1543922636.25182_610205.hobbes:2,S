Hi LKML,
	My computer running kernel 2.6.23 does not "hibernate" (suspend to disk using 
the kernel's methods) with a program (named stringTest) running in gdb, but 
has received a SIGABRT.
	The hibernate is successful when running kernel 2.6.22.7 !
Here is the message from gdb:
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::out_of_range'
  what():  basic_string::substr
Program received signal SIGABRT, Aborted.
0xb7fb6410 in __kernel_vsyscall ()
And the attached file is the portion of /var/log/syslog when the hibernate was 
attempted.
Let me know if there is anything else to send,
	C.
