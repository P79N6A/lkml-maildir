Hi there, I'm Eddy your shipboard computer...
well..I'm Donald, a relative newbie with a kernel question unlikely answerable elsewhere.
I'm running the newest release of LinuxPPC on my Mac G4.  I programme in C and Pascal and JAVA, and I have my nice Release 5 of CodeWarrior.
The question is this: I want to recompile my kernel, optimized for the G4 chip. Obviously, GCC isn't going to do this.  I'm assumeing there must be a way to compile the kernel without being in linux itself...how else would the first kernel of each new port be compiled?
Any ideas?
-Donald

it is larger than it WAS!"
