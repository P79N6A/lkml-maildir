Chopping small bits of utrace to mainline.
regset stuff looks reasonable and self-contained enough to start with.
However, regset part in utrace contain quite a few unused things, so
I'm leaving those alone. Their time will come (or won't).
This way we can merge non-racy stuff first and leave core utrace for
later.
