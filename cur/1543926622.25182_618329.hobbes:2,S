With your approach you made it impossible to set 64BIT from all*.config,
which is the proper way to set the defaults.

It was done for the wrong reasons, otherwise the warning before it should 
have been included as well and then the function could have been reused 
for the "# ... is not set" case as well.

Which is now the default and thus it behaves more like other archs.

What point is there in being able to specify ARCH=x86_64 and then still 
produce a 32bit kernel?

Seriously?
