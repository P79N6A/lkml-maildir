I tend to see this differently: cleanup_module() cannot fail, but it can 
sleep. So it's perfectly fine to deregister, wait until all references are 
gone, clean up and return. So a kind of two-stage unregister is already 
happening. 
It's different in that it does use explicit refcounting, but 
when the right interfaces are provided, the driver author doesn't need to 
care - the author should just call pci_unregister/netdev_unregister/.., 
that'll sleep until all references are gone (which also means no one will 
use callbacks into the module anymore) and be done.
