Unforunately, even jiffies.h gets special treatment. sched.h still 
includes jiffies.h, as this is where it was originally defined.
I've had that on my to-do list for some years now, but unfortunately it 
will probably remain there for some more.
Somebody else who wants to check all files for properly including 
jiffies.h and then remove the include from sched.h?
Thanks,
Tim
