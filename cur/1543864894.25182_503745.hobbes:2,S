I'm still of the opinion that you cannot do this without creating actual 
threads.  That said, there is room for setting up the task_struct beforehand 
without linking it into the system lists.  The reason I don't think this 
approach works (and I looked at it a few times) is that many things end 
up requiring special handling: things like permissions, signals, FPU state, 
segment registers....  The list ends up looking exactly the way task_struct 
is, making the actual savings very small.
What the fibrils approach is useful for is the launching of the thread 
initially, as you don't have to retain things like the current FPU state, 
change segment registers, etc.  Changing the stack is cheap, the rest of 
the work is not.
