Hmm, ok, so it's in the queue for 2.6.15.6 (since it obviously isn't
in current 2.6.15.5 -stable as that's where Steffen hit it), that's
good.

Hmm, I see that at least two things from the patch seems to be
aplicable to at least current -mm (haven't checked latest Linus -git
yet).
The bit that removes BITS_PER_BYTE from
arch/i386/mach-voyager/voyager_cat.c and the bit that removes the
duplicate #include <linux/mempolicy.h> and substitutes it with
#include <linux/types.h>  those bits would seem to apply to
2.6.16-rc5-mm1
include/linux/types.h already has the BITSPER_BYTE define in -mm.
