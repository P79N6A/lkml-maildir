Hello,
         I require a kernel module that will print
gateway IP addresses in routing table as well as it
should not print Gateways that appear to be the same
interface ip addresses of that linux machine.
         e.g. If my eth1 is 172.16.x.x and if same
appear in routing table for any entry having
172.16.x.x as Gateway then it should not appear in
output.
regards,
cranium
