It depends on who the user is.  In the case that inspired this thread
user space can profit from the information even when the kernel can't.
In addition it appears kernel code quality can benefit as well.

I agree bloat for no good reason is a bad habit to get into.
Premature optimization is a worse habit to get into, as is making
problems unnecessarily complex.  Until working patches are produced,
and the impact can be assessed it is to soon to seriously worry about
something that back of the napkin calculations indicate suggest
will have no measurable impact.
