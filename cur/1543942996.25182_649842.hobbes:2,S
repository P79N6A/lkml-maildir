Provided the amount of time this issue exists, I don't think it's worth
to push it to -stable.  It's an oooooooold, issue, which happens quite
rarely, and no one bothered to report it so far...  But it's not my
call... ;)
But...  I'm thinking about this scenario:
 # mount /data
 # quotaon /data
 (some maintenance stuff to be planned)
 # mount -o remount,ro /data
 (do backup etc)
 # mount -r remount,rw /data
at this point, it's expected that quota on /data is enabled.
After this patch, it's not anymore...
I think it's more usual scenario than mine (umount instead of
remount-rw).  And this change will break it.  So I'm not sure
what really to do here.  Probably refusing remount-ro if quota
is on is better...  it's annoying for sure, but at least it's
explicit, and avoids the handg too.
