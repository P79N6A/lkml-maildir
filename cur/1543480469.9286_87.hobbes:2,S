Alpha bootup is crashing for me with the message:
Freeing unused kernel memory: 104k freed
Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 0000000000000800
init(1): Oops 0
<all the registers dump>
This was from a compile of 2.2.0pre7ac7 on an AlphaStation 4/233 (Avanti).
It's been happening since ac5.  ac4 worked fine.
