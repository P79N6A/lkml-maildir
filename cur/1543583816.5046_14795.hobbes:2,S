Hmm.. useful until you actually want to modify a linked file,
but then your modifying the file in all "merged" trees.
Wouldn't it be cool to have an extended attribute
for files called "Copy on Write", so then you could
hardlink all duplicate files together, but when a file is
modified a copy is transparently created.
Actually should it be called "Copy On Modify"? since if
you copied a file there would be no need to make an actual
copy until the file was modified.
The only problem I see with this is that you wouldn't have
enough space to store a copy of a file, what would you do
in this case, just return an error on write?
Is there any way this could be extended across filesystems?
I suppose you could add it on top of existing DFS'?
I could see many uses for this, like backup systems, but perhaps
a block level system is more appropriate in this case?
(like the just announced SnapFS).
Is there any filesystem that supports this @ present?
