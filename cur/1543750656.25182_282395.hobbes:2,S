It needs suid only if you aren't root and you want to kill processes you 
don't own.
Yes, this might cause problems e.g. if users are allowed to mount their 
cdroms, but simply allowing them to kill processes of other users who 
access this device isn't a solution, too.

It's what Pavel wanted to get included in umount.
Usually, you'll let fuser give you the list of processes and inspect 
them manually.

Then put it into a while loop that executes until umount returns 0.
I still fail to see why I should implement half of fuser in umount. 
Either you are working at the command line and know about fuser or you 
are working through a GUI which can offer you a "kill all applications 
accessing this device" button that calls fuser.
