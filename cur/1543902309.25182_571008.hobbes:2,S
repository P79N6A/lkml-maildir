OK, some comments from me:

Note that this will change to /sys/class/block/ in the future.

Uh, that is actually the generic location?
It may be enough (and less confusing) to just state that the dev
attribute will belong to the associated "class" device sitting
under /sys/class/ (with the current exception of /sys/block/).
(And how about referring to Documentation/sysfs-rules.txt?)

Using a bash script is actually a very bad idea in the general case. It
can lead to OOM very quickly on large installations.

AFAIK, the normal mode of operation is to use the hotplug mechanism
during early setup but to disable it once you have a listener on
netlink in place. My systems have an empty /proc/sys/kernel/hotplug.

Would be good. See lib/kobject_uevent.c.

Huh? That's just the path in sysfs. And there's more than block and
char :) Check SUBSYSTEM for what your device actually is.

No. For devices, SUBSYSTEM may be the class (like 'scsi_device') or the
bus (like 'pci').

No, this actually is the current driver.

Uh. Please refer to Documentation/sysfs-rules.txt.
