Precisely.  Come back when you have a good sturdy set of arguments.  See
the FUSE project (Also discussed in this thread), for better ideas on  
how
to add strange filesystem semantics.  NOTE:  Even the FUSE project,  
which
is in _userspace_ (as opposed to the massive kernelspace mess of  
reiser4),
is taking a lot of flak for changing UNIX semantics, so I see no reason
why Reiser4 should be special.

It doesn't need perfection, it just needs to convince a large segment of
the developers on this list (and especially linus).

Ok, good.  That's one of the first issues.  A _lot_ of applications  
would get
themselves thoroughly confused at that '...' interface, not to  
mention a lot
of sysadmins :-D.

Good.  I think that we can all agree that, in the event  
cryptocompress is
included, it would be a nice feature to have in all filesystems.   
Therefore,
we should attempt to come up with a clean interface with which it  
could be
added _inside_ the VFS.

Likewise, this should be handled in a common VFS interface that all FSs
can use.  There already exists a key management system that would not be
particularly difficult to interface with, but it would take thought and
discussion.
