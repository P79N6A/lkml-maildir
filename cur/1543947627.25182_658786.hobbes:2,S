Apparently nobody has been doing it for a while. :-) Last time I did it it
was around the submission time and I actually patched it into mainline
kernel to do so. Not particularly hard to do, but sitting in mm-only does
make it a bit harder, and there are the vdso problem you just mentioned that
one has to fix for himself if it exists in mainline.

Is it possible to catch this automatically, like, by re-defining
likely/unlikely to the raw form in specific file(s)?
