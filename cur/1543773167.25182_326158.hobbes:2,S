Yep, that could happen.

Still have that problem with priority inversion. Kernel threads share
date structures with user processes (when they are in kernel mode) and
that kernel thread that is needed may get blocked on a process that is
lower in priority than the two mentioned above.

Only in the vanilla kernel. See Ingo's RT work. It handles priority
inversion and SCHED_RR/SCHED_FIFO are actually connected to "low
latency" and "realtime".
