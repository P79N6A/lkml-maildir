I tested it on a NF4-Professional system with 8GB RAM and a single 
SATA disk. It first did nicely in LTP and some other tests,
but during a bonnie++ run it eventually blocked with all
IO hanging forever. No output either. I did a full backtrace
and it just showed the processes waiting for a IO wakeup.
