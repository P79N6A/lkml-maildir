Well. The driver does not need to know anything about bcsr. All it needs to do is to execute the function pointer filled in bsp code, if one exists (If nothing needs to be tweaked in bsp level for a driver, just no need to fill that function pointer). For instance, in PQ2 uart, usb and fcc need to be enabled by bcsr before could be actually utilized, so say fs_enet does all needed upon startup, without messing with board setup code.
The same does cpm uart... 
In case of this particular board, it is not that bad. But I dislike the concept to execute the code in common (for this board) path, not depending if UCC eth disabled in config explicitly.
