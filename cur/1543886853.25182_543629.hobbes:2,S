The other cases don't lead to the specific issue this patch is meant to
prevent.  Namely, that if a kernel thread is identified as a user space task by
the freezer it may be frozen prematurely.
And yes, this only is a problem because we freeze kernel threads, which may be
avoidable, but we've been doing that for more than two years and it's a big
change to stop doing so.  We can't just say overnight that we won't be freezing
kernel threads from now on without al least checking if that doesn't lead to
user-visible problems.
Thus IMO it's reasonable to fix the potential issue with the current code and
think about changing the design *later*.  Still, I'm not so attached to this
patch and if you think that it should be dropped (which IMO is wrong), then so
be it.

The other races don't lead to the same (wrong) result.

There are no other cases, AFAICS, in which we can freeze a wrong thead.
That's, in fact, the point here.  The not freezing of the right one (when a
kernel thread does execve() and becomes a user land process) is a totally
separate issue unrelated to this patch.

Very well, but then, how are we supposed to know which is a kernel thread so
that we won't touch it?

You have already said for several times that in your opinion kernel threads
should not be frozen (for suspend, but I'm not sure about the CPU hotplug).
As far as I'm concerned, that's sufficient.  However, the reality is that we do
freeze kernel threads and we can't just stop doing that overnight.  At least,
we need to check what problems that will lead to before we decide to do this in
a stable kernel.
