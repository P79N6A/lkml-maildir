If you threw that much hardware at a Linux system, and then tuned it so that it
didn't really care about userspace performance (oh.. say.. by giving the knfsd
thread a RT priority ;), and tuned things like the filesystem, the slab
allocator and the networking stack to NFS requirements, it probably would be
screaming fast too.. ;)
