It is the way Linux is heading - becoming less free.  Lock-in to
distribution vendors.  And soon you'll need to pay distributions
to (timely) get the fixes.
To give an instance, because I don't work for a distribution, I don't
have access to the security lists.  Yet, I'm the guy who produces the
ARM patches which the ARM community at large use.
This situation caused HP to shut down their public ARM boxen while I
worked on integrating the security fix into the ARM tree.  Unfortunately,
this could only happen _after_ the problem was publically announced,
which means some of HPs systems were vulnerable to attack for a few
days.
If you think Linux today is about something "free"...
