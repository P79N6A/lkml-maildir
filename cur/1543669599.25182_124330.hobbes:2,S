I don't mean document them within the source, I mean a separate
document, (distributed with the source), that people can refer to to
find out what errors really mean.  That solves the verbose/non
versbose and translation problems.  Users simply do a substring search
of the manual for the error they're getting, and get an explaination
in any language that manual has been translated in to.  It doesn't
have to be limited to errors, either, there are a lot of undocumented
informational messages in the kernel, too.
I'd be happy to maintain such a document, but there doesn't seem much
interest in it, and I can't see why.
John.
