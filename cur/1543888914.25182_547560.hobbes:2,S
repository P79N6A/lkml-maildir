Subject: [PATCH] CFS: sched-design-CFS.txt - ambiguity about leftmost
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Hello,
I felt the description of the leftmost task a bit ambiguous. Is it the 
leftmost task in the rbtree?
or did u mean the "most leftout task" in the task list? If it is so then 
this patch should correct the leftmost task as "most leftout task". NACK 
it if I'm wrong. Just trying to help. :)
Changes "leftmost task" to "most leftout task".
