Hi,
  The latest version of the 8k wsize patch is now available on
http://www.fys.uio.no/~trondmy/src/nfsv2-wsize-0.7.dif
it should apply cleanly against stock linux-2.2.1. The purpose of this
patch is to support 8k wsize on platforms with a page size < 8k
(e.g. intel ix86) and to support write gathering on all platforms. It
mainly a port of Olaf Kirch's code for NFS3.
Naive benchmarking shows an increase in writing speed >~100% against
our rusty old AlphaServer. I invite people to test out performance
against their favourite server platform and to report results to me.
Features of the release 0.7 vs release 0.4:
  - Removal of some ugly bugs, including one that lead to pages
    being prematurely freed. (ditto on smbfs)
  - The RPC code no longer attempts to reconnect to the server when
    backlogged events time out. Only true networking timeouts should
    cause a reconnection.
  - A lower limit of 4 available xprt slots has been imposed so as to
    reduce RPC congestion ("Task xxxx can't get a request slot"). A
    more permanent fix will be to change the current congestion algorithm
    to prevent 'avalanche' effects whenever a backlogged event times out.
Enjoy,
 Trond
