No cigar. This stuff is all set up by the kernel on the stack;
in order you have
	Top of stack at 0xbfffffff
	environ[0]\0environ[1]\0\0	From high ..
	argv[0]\0argv[1]\0\0
	*environ[];
	*argv[];			.. to low.
The kernel only reserves space as needed. If you have an empty
environment, and you copy 512 bytes over argv[0], you'll end
up with a SEGV.
If you want to modify argv[0] etc, loop over argv[], count howmuch
space there is (strlen(argv[0] + 1 + strlen(argv[1] + 1 ... etc)
and make sure you do NOT write a string longer than that. Also
make sure that you end the string with a double \0
