It's about something entirely different.  This parameter tells md after
how much inactivity time to update the superblocks to indicate the array
is "clean" - so that in case of power loss w/o shutting down the array,
it will not require reconstruction.  It has nothing to do with timeouts.
By the way, linux raid is usually discussed at linux-raid@vger, not here.
