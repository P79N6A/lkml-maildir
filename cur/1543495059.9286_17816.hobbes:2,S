I haven't thought about that yet, but I think we _will_
have to think up something to make the current scheduler
more responsive and more predictable under load and to
reduce the CPU time used by niced tasks.
I think that even without the priority heap we can use the
Quantum/Defer model in order to get better predictability
and responsiveness under load.
