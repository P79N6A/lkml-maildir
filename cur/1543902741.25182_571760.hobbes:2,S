I think I've found it:
ftp://ftp.software.ibm.com/software/tivoli_support/patches/patches_6.0.0/6.0.0-TIV-PDO-FP0007/6.0.0-TIV-PDO-Linux.i386-FP0007.tar
Is that correct?
  kail_trap_syscalls() 
seems to be revectoring the syscall table and siliently disabling any 
active LSM.
  kail_restore_syscalls()
attempts to restore them on module unload.
Is my understanding correct?
You're shipping this to customers as a security feature?
