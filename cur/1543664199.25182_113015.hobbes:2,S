Can't see what an IDE chip-set has to do with it. The RTC can only
be accessed as an offset-location and a data-location. You write
an offset at one location and you read/write data at another location.
On an ix86, the locations are adjacent byte-wide ports. On the Sparc
they are adjacent dword-wide memory locations.
