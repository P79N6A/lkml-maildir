Hi Linus,
I still have 1 new driver and 1 Documentation update for the watchdog device
drivers. This doesn't impact the current drivers.
So can you please pull from 'master' branch of
	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/wim/linux-2.6-watchdog.git
or if master.kernel.org hasn't synced up yet:
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/wim/linux-2.6-watchdog.git
This will update the following files:

    [WATCHDOG] clean-up watchdog documentation
    
    Random sampling of some URLs in the Documentation tree to see how many were
    stale found that one watchdog driver was now a porn site.  In fact if the
    watchdogs document directory was any older it would be written in latin
    
    Clean it up somewhat and add Last reviewed headers, something all the
    Documentation could do with IMHO.

-
-	Watchdog cannot be turned off, CONFIG_WATCHDOG_NOWAYOUT
-	does not make sense
-
-	GETSUPPORT returns the watchdog_info struct, and
-	GETSTATUS returns the supported options. GETBOOTSTATUS
-	returns a 1 if the last reset was caused by the
-	watchdog and a 0 otherwise. This watchdog cannot be
-	disabled once it has been started. The wdt_period kernel
-	parameter selects which bit of the time base changing
-	from 0->1 will trigger the watchdog exception. Changing
-	the timeout from the ioctl calls will change the

-	Watchdog Timer Interfaces For The Linux Operating System
-

-	     Custom Linux Driver And Program Development
-
-
-The following watchdog drivers are currently implemented:
-
-	ICS	WDT501-P
-	ICS	WDT501-P (no fan tachometer)
-	ICS	WDT500-P
-	Software Only
-	SA1100 Internal Watchdog
-	Berkshire Products PC Watchdog Revision A & C (by Ken Hollis)
-
-
-All six interfaces provide /dev/watchdog, which when open must be written
-to within a timeout or the machine will reboot. Each write delays the reboot
-time another timeout. In the case of the software watchdog the ability to 
-reboot will depend on the state of the machines and interrupts. The hardware
-boards physically pull the machine down off their own onboard timers and
-will reboot from almost anything.
-
-A second temperature monitoring interface is available on the WDT501P cards
-and some Berkshire cards. This provides /dev/temperature. This is the machine 
-internal temperature in degrees Fahrenheit. Each read returns a single byte 
-giving the temperature.
-
-The third interface logs kernel messages on additional alert events.
-
-Both software and hardware watchdog drivers are available in the standard
-kernel. If you are using the software watchdog, you probably also want
-to use "panic=60" as a boot argument as well.
-
-The wdt card cannot be safely probed for. Instead you need to pass
-wdt=ioaddr,irq as a boot parameter - eg "wdt=0x240,11".
-
-The SA1100 watchdog module can be configured with the "sa1100_margin"
-commandline argument which specifies timeout value in seconds.
-
-The i810 TCO watchdog modules can be configured with the "i810_margin"
-commandline argument which specifies the counter initial value. The counter
-is decremented every 0.6 seconds and default to 50 (30 seconds). Values can
-range between 3 and 63.
-
-The i810 TCO watchdog driver also implements the WDIOC_GETSTATUS and
-WDIOC_GETBOOTSTATUS ioctl()s. WDIOC_GETSTATUS returns the actual counter value
-and WDIOC_GETBOOTSTATUS returns the value of TCO2 Status Register (see Intel's
-documentation for the 82801AA and 82801AB datasheet).
