Because it generates enormously inefficient code on RISC
platforms.  It turns simple word loads like:
	ld	[%addr], %reg
into something like:
	ldub	[%addr + 0], %tmp1
	ldub	[%addr + 1], %tmp2
	ldub	[%addr + 2], %tmp3
	ldub	[%addr + 3], %tmp4
	sll	%tmp1, 24, %tmp1
	sll	%tmp2, 16, %tmp2
	sll	%tmp3, 8, %tmp3
	or	%tmp1, %tmp2, %tmp1
	or	%tmp1, %tmp3, %tmp1
	or	%tmp1, %tmp4, %reg
A ten-fold increase in code size just to access any member
of the structure.
I think you have no idea how astronomically inefficient the code is
which gets generated when you add the packed attribute to a structure.
