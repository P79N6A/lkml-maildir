Sorry, got sidetracked by other stuff.
Still no boot with 2.9.20-rc1 and -rc2, and none of the kernels I tried in
between.
initrd is sane (the only differences between the one built for working
2.6.19.1 and broken 2.6.20-rc2 are among the modules themselves). What I
did was:
  cd /tmp
  mkdir ird-$version
  cd ird-$version
  zcat /boot/initrd-$version.img | cpio -i
and then "diff -Nur ird-$1 ird-$2". Now to teach diff(1) to compare devices
reasonably...
Tried latest from Fedora rawhide (mkinitrd-6.0.6-1), no boot. initrd is
huge, so I went back to mkinitrd-5.1.19-1.
