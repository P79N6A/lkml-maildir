Ah.  That makes sense.

:)

Yes.  That sounds like the right thing to do.  
I remember trying to compute a good memsize when I created the bzImage
header but it is completely possible I missed some part of the
calculation or assumed that the kernels .bss section would always be
larger than what I needed for decompression.
