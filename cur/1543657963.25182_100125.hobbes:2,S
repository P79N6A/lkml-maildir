How about this:
arch/m68k/mac/psc.c
/*
 * Try to kill all DMA channels on the PSC. Not sure how this his
 * supposed to work; this is code lifted from macmace.c and then
 * expanded to cover what I think are the other 7 channels.
 */
void psc_dma_die_die_die(void)
{
        int i;
        printk("Killing all PSC DMA channels...");
        for (i = 0 ; i < 9 ; i++) {
                psc_write_word(PSC_CTL_BASE + (i << 4), 0x8800);
                psc_write_word(PSC_CTL_BASE + (i << 4), 0x1000);
                psc_write_word(PSC_CMD_BASE + (i << 5), 0x1100);
                psc_write_word(PSC_CMD_BASE + (i << 5) + 0x10, 0x1100);
        }
        printk("done!\n");
}
