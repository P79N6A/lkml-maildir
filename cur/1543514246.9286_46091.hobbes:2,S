Folks,
I seem to be getting these messages in my system logs
everytime there is high disk activity on my system.
It is dragging down the system performance cause 
I have to wait until the bus resets. Any ideas
why or what I can do to fix it? this is a 
freshly installed redhat 6.0 system. I am not
using the hpt controler yet.. just the normal
ide channels.
hda: status timeout: status=0xd0 { busy }
hda: no DRQ after issuing WRITE
ide0: reset: success
Thanks... Mike
