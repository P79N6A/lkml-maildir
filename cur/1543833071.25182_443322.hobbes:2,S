It is linked in as an object, not into the library archive,
that's why that one works like that.
That is why io.o is added to the "obj-y" variable instead of the
"lib-y" variable.  It is also necessary to link these things
in as objects when module exports are present, because if there
is no in-kernel reference to the function, you won't get the
function nor it's module export :)
