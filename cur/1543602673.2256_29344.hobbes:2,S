My machine has been running 2.4.10 (+preemptive kernel patches) happily.
But then, running top and sorting by memory usage, I notice at the top:
 16:30:47 up 2 days,  3:36, 22 users,  load average: 1.34, 1.62, 1.78

This looks bad! But is it a bug in the kernel, or with 'top'? There are no
dmesg errors.  Has anyone got advice on what I could do to track down what
the problem is?
Thanks,
Ben
