Subject: 2.3 wish: integrate pcmcia into mainstream kernel

Hi!
`subj` is my 2.3 wish. Having pcmcia support outside of standard
kernel makes pcmcia drivers second-class citizens, which only work
sometimes. I do not think that pcmcia package is developing so fast
that it could not be integrated into mainstream. And, btw, mainstream
kernels need support for hotplug, anyway, see hotpluggable PCI and
USB.
