For X there is the synaptics driver, with more features than the pads
PS/2 mode.
For GPM there are the abovementioned patches, with configurable tap
characteristics, etc. They should be at least as good as the pads own
PS/2 mode.
For other legacy applications, there is the gpm repeater mode, exporting
GPM's functionality over the PS/2 protocol.
For legacy applications without GPM on the system, there is mousedev.c,
creating virtualized PS/2 devices for every application that opens it.
Its tap handling is not perfect, and it's not very much configurable,
but it works.
IMO there are enough options to make the device work well in absolute
mode.
If a relative mode is an absolute must, then a kernel option is IMO
sufficient (we have psmouse.proto=imps for the classic PS/2 Synaptics
pads), although a sysfs attribute would likely be better.
In theory, we could use EV_SYN, SYN_CONFIG for notifying applications
that the device has changed its capabilities, but a
disconnect/recreation will work better, since no applications support
the SYN_CONFIG notification ATM.
