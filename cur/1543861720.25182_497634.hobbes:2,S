Good point!
Fundamentally, I think we need to answer this question:
"Do we provide *some* mechanism to block concurrent hotplug operations
from happening? By hotplug operations I mean both changes to the bitmap
and execution of all baclbacks in CPU_DEAD/ONLINE etc"
If NO, then IMHO we will be forever fixing races
If YES, then what is that mechanism? freeze_processes()? or a magical
lock?
freeze_processes() cant be that mechanism, if my understanding of it is
correct - see 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/1/8/149
 and 
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=116817460726058.
I would be happy to be corrected if the above impression of
freeze_processes() is corrected ..
