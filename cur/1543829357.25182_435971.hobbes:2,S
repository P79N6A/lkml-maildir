y'know, if an innocent civilian were to stumble across this code he or she
would wonder "wtf is that doing"?
He or she would then go to the definition of spin_unlock_non_nested() and
would find it to be 100% comment-free.
IOW, hasty hackery is flying in all directions and the kernel is getting
crappier as a result.
And that's OK for now, because at some stage I'll be dropping the whole lot
so you can redo the series.  But I just don't know what's in there any more
and we'll need to re-changelog, re-document, re-comment and re-review
everything in the for-real patch series.  (ISTR having some minor comments
and questions against the initial patch series?)
We'll need to review it for comprehensibility (hence maintainability).
We'll need to measure the configged-off code size increase.
I think we have quite a long way to go yet on this stuff.
