Sorry, I'll explain a little more about I'm doing.
The kernel I'm running is the default kernel from the (unofficial) 
debian amd64 distro.  uname says it's 2.6.8-11-amd64-generic.  When 
running a 32bit app, linked against the 32bit libraries, calling a 64bit 
driver in, the kernel logs messages saying something along the lines of 
"ioctl32 not defined".
The headers I'm building my modules against are from the package 
'kernel-headers-2.6.8-11-amd64-generic' which leaves me with the 
directory 'kernel-headers-2.6.8-11-amd64-generic' in /usr/src. 
My problem is that when I look in the headers at the file_operations 
struct for compat_ioctl there's no entry there, and I therefore can't 
define a function for it.  I had no idea there was a dynamic system in 
place before what's mentioned on lwn.  I'd assumed that as my kernel was 
trying to call ioctl32, that it would have had the patch applied, and 
it's headers should have contained an appropriate entry in file_operations.
So it looks like I'll have implement both ways of doing things, one for 
pre-2.6.11 and another for post 2.6.11 kernels.
Would you know of anywhere else I could look for information on the 
dynamic method you mentioned that existed in kernels before 2.6.11.
Thanks for the help btw.  Much appreciated.
