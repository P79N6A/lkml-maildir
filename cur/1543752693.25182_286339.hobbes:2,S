The more interestion options would have been:
CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL=y
# CONFIG_CLEAN_COMPILE is not set
CONFIG_BROKEN=y
If you answer "yes" to
  "Prompt for development and/or incomplete code/drivers"
and "no" to
  "Select only drivers expected to compile cleanly"
it souldn't be a big surprise if a driver doesn't compile.
