Although most OHCI implementations are PCI based, there are embedded 
link controllers that are not (OHCI nor) PCI-based.
Here is a driver by Steve Kinneberg that shows how he removed the 
dependencies on CONFIG_PCI and written around the DMA functions.
http://mailman.uclinux.org/pipermail/uclinux-dev/2004-January/023691.html
Based on this driver (thanks again Steve if you read this) we are adding 
support for a Philips link layer device.
Regards,
Leon.
