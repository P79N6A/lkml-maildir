They why would you tell tar not to use cache?  If you know what's happening
next you need to tell the system (feed-forward), not have it try to read your
mind.  I'm assuming your modified tar would have an option switch
to cause this behaviour, not be hard coded...

Yes, so a script that does the above wouldn't enable no cache mode
for written files.  The program doesn't know, but the encompasing
script (or person at console) does.
