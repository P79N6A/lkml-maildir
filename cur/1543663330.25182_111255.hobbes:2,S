I run three file API tests regularly against it - fsx, the connecathon
"nfs" tests and iozone and use them as a sort of regression test bucket
(which unfortunately didn't pick this problem up) - as a result of this I
will add "ls -R" of a deep directory tree to the list (ls -R of a shallow
tree doesn't seem to show this problem up) - if there are other useful
filesystem regression cases that I could automate and run, I would love to
know about them.
