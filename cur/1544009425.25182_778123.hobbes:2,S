Thing is, this 'cleanup' removes quite a bit of complexity from the core
hrtimer code, and afaict your bit is the only thing that cannot seem to
cope. So I'd rather look at fixing your site than re-introduce softirqs
to hrtimers.

What are the timing constraints of your problem? - I assume they are not
too aggressive, otherwise you'd not be able to run from softirq, could
you run from keventd?
