The first implementation is in 1962 with CTSS if i remember correctly.
Multics initially had something like that too.

Anyway that's pretty standard CS stuff. Multi-level Queues with
feedback, exponentially longer timeslices with lower priority.
I was reading this recently, that's why i wondered why linux calculate
timeslice "inversed" versus what is proposed in theory.
