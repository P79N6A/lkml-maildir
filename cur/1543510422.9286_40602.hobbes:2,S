The real problem (at least in my case, since it's not in a commercial
production environment) is the inability to debug the crashes.  I don't
have a serial console, so I can't see if anything is happening that
way.  The machine is completely inaccessible from the network, and the
magic keys don't work. And there aren't any error messages in the logs. 
'Tis a frustration, indeed! Plus, it doesn't happen real often (once or
twice a month, maybe, and this was the first with 2.2.12).
I've read about and have the kdb patch, but I think that patch defeats
it's very purpose.  Patching the kernel like that makes changes to the
kernel, no matter how subtle.  Those changes could negate the very bug
we're trying to find.  I've had that problem with other
programs--changing a couple of lines of code (adding a printf or printk,
etc, for debugging), has made the program never fail.  <sigh> A way to
attach to/monitor a currently running kernel without first patching that
kernel would be optimal.  Is there such a beast?
