No, the reason I'm not crazy about it is that I simply _hate_ having too 
many user knobs to tweak. I don't like tweaking like that, it's just 
disturbing. 
I'd probably be happier if the current one didn't even _ask_ the user (or
only asked the user if kernel debugging is enabled), and just silently
defaulted to the normal values.
