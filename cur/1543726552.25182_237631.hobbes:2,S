It can be triggered with that patch reverted.

Just a `du -s' over zillions of files on a 2G machine.

Seems that we reach a state where lowmem pagecache get reclaimed faster
than dcache/icache.  This causes the number of pages scanned for lowmem
allocations to fall.  This causes less scanning of the slab and the whole
thing repeats.  I expect changing nr_used_zone_pages() to ignore highmem
will fix it, and might be the long-term fix, too.
