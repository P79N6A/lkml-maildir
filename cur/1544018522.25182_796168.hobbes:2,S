Subject: [patch 29/40] mm: write_cache_pages early loop termination
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

2.6.27-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
From: Nick Piggin <npiggin@suse.de>
commit bd19e012f6fd3b7309689165ea865cbb7bb88c1e upstream.
We'd like to break out of the loop early in many situations, however the
existing code has been setting mapping->writeback_index past the final
page in the pagevec lookup for cyclic writeback.  This is a problem if we
don't process all pages up to the final page.
Currently the code mostly keeps writeback_index reasonable and hacked
around this by not breaking out of the loop or writing pages outside the
range in these cases.  Keep track of a real "done index" that enables us
to terminate the loop in a much more flexible manner.
Needed by the subsequent patch to preserve writepage errors, and then
further patches to break out of the loop early for other reasons.  However
there are no functional changes with this patch alone.
