Hello,
    We are using an SMSC91C111 Ethernet chip set on a board we 
developed. The board uses a coldfire 5407 processor and runs the 
uClinux-2.4.x kernel (I have also sent this email to the uClinux 
development list). The driver for the SMSC91C111 is the same for both 
uClinux and Linux.
 When a flood ping the board, the I get the following error:
NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth0: transmit timed out
eth0: transmit timed out, IRQ conflict?
Scheduling in interrupt
kernel BUG at sched.c:569!
Kernel panic: BUG!
In interrupt handler - not syncing
Does anybody have a suggestion of what could be going wrong?
I noticed some other people using this chip had problems with interrupts 
from the chip. Has anybody found a work around to these problems. Does 
anybody have a patch to the driver to fix this?
Thank You,
Kendrick Hamilton.
