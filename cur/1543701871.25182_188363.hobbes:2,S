2.6.1rc1 works great for me under vmware 4.05 (6030), but that's with an
ancient glibc and /sbin/init that do not know of sysenter among other
things.
There is one regression, though: 2.2.x and 2.4.x can see /dev/fd0 and
/dev/fd1 under vmware. 2.6.1rc1 only find /dev/fd0. Does anyone else see
this?
There's quite a few changes in floppy.c from 2.4 to 2.6 - I couldn't quite
spot what could be the culprit.
