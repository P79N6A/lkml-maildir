The metric which we need to be balancing on here is
	(probability that the object will be needed again) *
	(number of seeks to reestablish the object) /
	(size of object).
The first two factors are wildass guesses.  I figure a pagecache page is
worth maybe 1/8th of a seek and an inode is worth, umm, more than that. 
Maybe half a seek?  Our accounting for this is currently way off and needs
to be tuned up.
One big problem with implementing slab balancing is that the inode cache is
a separate slab per filesystem, so any fancy accounting of icache requires
visits to all filesystems.
Now it could well be that inode_unused is a complete waste of space.  After
all, these are inodes whose dentries have been reaped - it is unlikely that
they're much use.  And it could be that their backing block is still in
pagecache anyway.
So if getting the dcache accounted for is not sufficient then it might be
necessary to either shrink the heck out of inode_unused of just kill it
altogether.

No, you're right - it doesn't make a lot of sense.
