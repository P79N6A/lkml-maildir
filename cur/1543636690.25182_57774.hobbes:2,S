What I was advocating was a schedule of:
1) feature submission deadline
2) period of working through feature backlog
3) feature acceptance ending date
Most release management teams in the industry do things this way, 
and.... I'd better say no more, those words will lose me the argument.;-)
I'll admit that in most companies the features to be merged backlog 
period lasts for only a few days, and due to the difference in scale, it 
would probably last a few weeks for Linux, but in my egocentrism I 
really think that providing submitters with certainty as to what they 
need to do to get a patch in is a good thing.
I understand though that maybe the needs of the submitters aren't the 
most important thing for Linux as a whole, and so others will 
legitimately disagree.
