Subject: [Maybe offtopic] How to test IPv6 in a IPv4 world?

This is mainly out of curiosity, and a chance to bash bugs without use of
Raid(tm).
How can someone give the IPv6 kernel code a whirl when they are stuck in
IPv4-land? I would like to try this out just to get an "edge" on the upcoming
format and I'm sure there are some buglets in the ipv6 asking to be smashed.
Private replies only.. I'm fearing Richard Gooch's procmail fury. :)
