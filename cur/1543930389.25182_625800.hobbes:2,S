The following is a series of patches related to Unionfs: just a couple of
small bug fixes and/or optimizations.
These patches were tested (where appropriate) on Linus's 2.6.24 latest code
(as of v2.6.24-rc4-124-gf194d13), MM, as well as the backports to
2.6.{23,22,21,20,19,18,9} on ext2/3/4, xfs, reiserfs, nfs2/3/4, jffs2,
ramfs, tmpfs, cramfs, and squashfs (where available).  See
http://unionfs.filesystems.org/
 to download back-ported unionfs code.
Please pull from the 'master' branch of
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ezk/unionfs.git
to receive the following:
