So the practical problem are peoples legacy boot setups but those
are quickly going away.
The sane thing is probably something that can be taken as a low
level format command for the block device.
Say: dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/ramX
I know rewriting the drive with all zeroes can cause a modern
disk to redo it's low level format.  And that is something
we can definitely implement without any backwards compatibility
problems.
Hmm. Do we have anything special for punching holes in files?
That would be another sane route to take to remove the special
case for clearing the memory.
