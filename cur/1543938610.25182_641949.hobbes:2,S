Okay, I'll go back and rework the offending descriptions for this and
the other patches in this set.

I should have written "simpler," I suppose.
Before:
=======
struct tso_param {
	u32 tsopu;      /* tso_param upper word */
	u32 tsopl;      /* tso_param lower word */
};
struct csum_param {
	u32 csumpu;     /* csum_param upper word */
	u32 csumpl;     /* csum_param lower word */
};
union tpd_descr {
	u64 data;
	struct csum_param csum;
	struct tso_param tso;
};
struct tx_packet_desc {
	__le64 buffer_addr;
	union tpd_descr desc;
};
After:
======
struct tx_packet_desc {
        __le64 buffer_addr;
        __le32 word2;
        __le32 word3;
};
