For good or ill by having the copyrights not held by one
person but instead held by so many is that no-one can
arbitrarily change the license or relicense under other
terms without the permission of all of the copyright
holders.  However much you might trust Linus, do you want to
trust his grandchildren?  Or the foundation after corporate
interests have subverted it?

The reason to assign your copyright to the FSF is to give
them standing in court to defend the copyright.
