   I wonder, does this mean that the compiler failed to inline the function?
   Removing __inline__ is not the correct solution.
I already posted what the correct fix is :-)  And this is already
pushed to 2.5.x
Inlining is not guarenteed, and:
extern inline ... foo(...)
means "inline if you can, I have a compiled-in implementation
in some object somewhere" whereas:
static inline ... foo(...)
means "inline if you can, if there is a case where you cannot
emit this as a function into the current module"
