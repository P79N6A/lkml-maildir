I think we all agree :-)

ASUS it's not actually violating any spec...

The point is that there is only 1 physical sensor, which both ACPI and
a native driver want to drive; transaction on SMBus to read the sensor
are usually in the form "select bank" + "read" and the sequence is
*not* atomic. In ASUS case the IO ports are correctly reserved by the
firmware, but (historically) this wasn't taken into account.
Aside from ASUS the problem is generic since there are two drivers
poking at the same hardware; for example there are reports of native
drivers interfering with normal TZ polling (see [1]). The EC does not
make any difference, since a native driver would speak directly to the
monitoring chip, effectively by-passing the EC.
Now, in principle "strict" is the correct behaviour for the resource
checking code, but it would break many working setups leaving the
users without any kind of hw monitoring. The "auto" hack is meant to
force the users to migrate to the ACPI driver...

Right now "auto" is ASUS-specific because *I* know that there any many
different native drivers that works on various boards (and I wrote the
the ACPI driver...); At least eeepc and (some?) thinkpads have ACPI
hwmon capabilities but I don't know whether there are native drivers
available or not (but they could be "blacklisted"  preemptively like
ASUS ATK).
