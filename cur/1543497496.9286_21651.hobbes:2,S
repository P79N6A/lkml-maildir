Do you really like troff? I do not believe... Well, no problems. Make them!
What's about me, I daresay I never read manpages, particularly
because I cannot stop retch when remember what they are prepared from 8)8)
Also I do not remember that I read some text from screen, I have
printer yet.
If you like html, it is just superb. If the result of your work
will have approximately the same appearance as tex version,
I even agree to maintain the changes in it in future.

Seems, you do mistake. Nobody plans to replace anything.
ifconfig, netstat and route are classic tools.
"ip" even did not overlap with them until recently.
