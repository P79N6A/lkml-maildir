Yes.  If we want so support security models more complicated than plain
UNIX DAC (an especially more than one of those) there's no way around
moving all access control out of the core kernel.

Well, usually adding changes to the core kernel in a proper way needs
major refactoring of code - the approach of adding a small, "non-invasive"
hack here and there leads to the typical mess seen in commercial operating
systems, and in Linux we've avoided that mostly so far.
As far keeping the current LSM hooks:  I'm very unhappy with the design
of the, that's one point.  The other point I'm extremly unhappy with
adding them without adding it's users.  I'll shut up and be quite until
2.7 opens if you get a meaningfull LSM module merged that actually uses
those hooks.  If you don't get one in by 2.6-test I will send patches
to remove those unused hooks.
