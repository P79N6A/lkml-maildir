Not if you have a partition table.  If you take into account the
individual partition offset, I think your formula is ok.
On a floppy (no partition table) you'd be fine.
It's not always that easy, of course.  Think of RAID (logical block
mapping can be a complex formula), LVM (the mapping is stored in a
table in the volume group metadata), CD-ROMs (what exactly do you mean
by "block"...?) and other such.
