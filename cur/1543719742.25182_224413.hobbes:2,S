Network block devices don't actually show up in /proc/partitions, but 
you have a valid point that the other uses would change. Although, I 
think it's a change for the better.

Fair enough. I can live with this discrepancy, although I think nbd is 
the only block device driver that has this problem. That's the only 
reason I sent the patch along...just trying to make nbd consistent with 
all the other device drivers.
Thanks,
