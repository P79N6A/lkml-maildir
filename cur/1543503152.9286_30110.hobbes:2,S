OK, I'm convinced--- for this case.  (BTW, we'll probably have to have the
child unlock any data structures locked by the parent, and the parent
shouldn't touch them anymore after the clone() _unless_ there was an error
in the child...  Tricky.)
There are still other valid uses for CLONE_SUSPEND, though.  For example,
I may want to create myself a pool of tasks to be used for future AIOs (or
even for future threads, if I know I'm gonna have some and want to save
the cloning time).
And it's cheap.

I never claimed they're `very' expensive, but they're not free...
