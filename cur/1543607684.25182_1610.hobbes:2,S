Errr .. haven't read the patches. But are you doing something so that
the semantics of the action taken after a media check fails can
be overridden? The current invalidate_inodes is too strong for me,
since I am proxying a remote device, and I don't want to kill 
_all_ the local file descriptors when the remote media disappears. 
I need to at least continue to send down local ioctls!
No, no suggestions of an extra control device, please. Simplicity.

and I'd like to have "invalidate" as a method too.
