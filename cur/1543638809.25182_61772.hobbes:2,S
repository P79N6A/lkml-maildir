Subject: Heavy Clock-Drift after update from Kernel 2.4.9 to 2.4.19

I updated to 2.4.19 the day after it was released. Since then i have a
heavy clock-drift problem.
Some time there is no clock drift, other times there is heavy clock drift.
e.g. When i load a page with mozilla. The "rotating thing" spins
randomly fast/normal.
Or when i play a movie with "xine". Every few seconds the playing gets
faster and then back to normal.
With 2.4.9 the clock was "rock solid" for weeks.
A bit strange is that it seems to depend on load. Higher load seems to
cause less/none clock drift.
(e.g. when i compile something in background, the "rotating thing" in
mozilla doesn't spin to fast)
Hardware is a Dual-PIII-933Mhz. Kernel is configured as SMP.
Any more details needed?
Bis denn
