Subject: Does bonding interfere with Raw packet binding ?

Hello,
The PF_PACKET protocol family was defined to allow root applications to bind
themselves with network devices without going through all the network stack.
What happens if an application binds itself to a device that is a slave in a
bonding team?
The skb_bond() function in dev.c changes the skb->dev from the slave device
to a master device. It seems that this will block the application from
receiving its packets.
Dying to get some input on this Q.
Thanks,
Tsippy
