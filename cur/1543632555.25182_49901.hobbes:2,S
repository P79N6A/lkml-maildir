Somehow I can't resist, but this sounds like the
devfs and RaiserFS story again:
- devfs claimed "It will solve all major/minor number problems".
   Well we still struggle to get over with them. But now we have to
   account for the intricacies of devfs in addition too.
- RaiserFS "Trees rule the world".
   Well ext3 (no I don't care about inn server!) is faster
   XFS is better manegeable. The "mutable filesystem semantics" modules
   and what a not are nowehre in sight.
Both projects which got included due to "public preasure".
