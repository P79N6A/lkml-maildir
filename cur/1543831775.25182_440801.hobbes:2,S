I think we should probably remove the test. The failure mode was simply 
that a machine with the "halt" idle loop simply didn't work, and would 
lock up. The most likely reason for that is probably just a bad CPU power 
VRM, and the potential high current fluctuations, not so much any CPU bug 
itself.
Anybody with that old a CPU will have learnt to to say "no-hlt" or 
whatever the kernel command line is, and we could probably retire the 
silly old hlt check (which I'm not even sure really ever worked).
