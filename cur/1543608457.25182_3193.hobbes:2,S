I had some persistent difficulties (strange messages on bootup, but
otherwise fine operation) with 6.2.1 which went away when I upgraded to
6.2.4. This is not exactly helpful because you just don't play games on
a production machine, but might be a hint nonetheless. I'm currently
running 2.4.12-ac6 with some netfilter updates on my machines because
the SuSE 2.4.10 kernel that ships with 7.3 froze solid on at least two
machines for reasons I cannot tell.
