It is definitly not - tftp is 512 byte packets and with
a 1.4MB kernel and a slow decstation :)

It does - how would it then be able to BEGINN a tftp download. 
It starts the tftp download and after some seconds it stops transferring.
I discovered the bug by doing a tcpdump - When the tftp stops
i can see the tftp server trying to do an arp request but
the client (Decstation prom) doesnt answer so the tftp times out.
