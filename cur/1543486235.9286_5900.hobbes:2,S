	I am pretty sure that the answer to this question is "no", but
I thought I ought to check to avoid duplication of effort.  There does not
appear to be knfsd development mailing list so, linux-kernel seems to
be the most appropriate place to ask.
	Is there a way to make knfsd run in the foreground (i.e., not
fork when it spawns the last nfsd process)?
	The reason that I want to do this is that I want to run knfsd
from inetd so that machines whose nfs services are rarely accessed do
not have to start knfsd every time they boot.  I realize I could write
a helper program that just invokes knfsd and stops without exiting, but
that is ugly and I would like to add some option for knfsd to
automatically unload and exit if it has not been used for a while.
