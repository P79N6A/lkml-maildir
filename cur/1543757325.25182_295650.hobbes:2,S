I started a similar project - but it uses the existing loops,
just using {pte,pmd,pud,pgd}_next. The idea is to optimize
page table walking by keeping some state in the struct page
of the page table page that says whether an entry is set 
or not. To make this work I switched everything to indexes
instead of pointers.
Main problem are some nasty include loops.
