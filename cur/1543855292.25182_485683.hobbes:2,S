Why?  I'm not much of a C language lawyer, but I would have thought
that in something like
	(x) + _a - 1
the "1" will be promoted to the type of the rest of the expression
without any explicit cast.  I tested the unsigned long/unsigned int
and u64/int cases of ALIGN(), and my macro with typeof() works for
both of those cases at least.

akpm is CC'ed on this thread.  Andrew, are you going to pick this up?
