Long long ago, the hibernation is not done by Linux kernel itself but
BIOS (APM). Those days, kernel just does some preparation and jump to
BIOS to do the hibernation. Imagine kernel B is the hibernation BIOS,
kernel A does some prepare and jump to the BIOS (kernel B) just like the
old days.

I think "kexec based hibernation" is the only currently available
possible method to write out image without freezer (after driver works
are done). If other process is running, how to prevent them from writing
to disk without freezing them in current implementation?
