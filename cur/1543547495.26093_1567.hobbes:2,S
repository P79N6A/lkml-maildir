Hi,
Attempting to shutdown -r now I got an oops somewhere in send_sig_info()
called from some of this new thread-group stuff, I haven't looked closely
yet. I will, of course, setup the environment (vmware) for debugging this
but I am letting you know, in case you fix it before I do.
Regards,
Tigran
