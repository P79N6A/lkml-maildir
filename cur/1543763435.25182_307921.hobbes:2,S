Hi,
please help!!!
I have a 4 years old SuperMicro server (dual P3) with an
Adaptec I2O raid controler.
This server is running just fine with 2.4.28-pre3.
Now I've tried to run it under 2.6.12-rc1-bk3 (and -bk1)
First the system seems to boot normally, but then I get a
kernel panic - not syncing: Fatal exception in interrupt
EIP is at adpt_isr+0x131/0x230
in process swapper.
The same kernel is running just fine on a twin machine but
which doesn't have an adaptec raid controler.
The Adaptec controler shows up as
Adaptec I2O BIOS v 001.3W  2001/05/10
I've configured
CONFIG_SCSI_DPT_I2O=y
CONFIG_I2O=y
CONFIG_I2O_BLOCK=y
CONFIG_I2O_SCSI=y
CONFIG_I2O_PROC=y
Many thanks for any hints.
Should I upgrade the Adaptec BIOS though I'm a bit afraid of that.
