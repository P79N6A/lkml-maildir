Tivo did not program or sell the hard drive to be used in an arbitrary
Linux PC.  They sold the hard drive to be used in their hardware, with
a Linux kernel specifically modified for that.  Without the right
digital signature, it does not do the same thing: it is *incomplete*.
That is eminently a software issue.  Hardware limitations -- whether
they be RAM size or requirement for a certain digital signature -- are
beside the point.
The requirement that I "modify a bit in the kernel image header" is
also one of the most pathetic cop-outs I have seen.  What makes that
binary format the preferred form for modification of Linux?
