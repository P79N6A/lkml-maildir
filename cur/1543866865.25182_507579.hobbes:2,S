You use the encryption patches for suspend. And even if you turn your
laptop off and leave it somewhere for a bit I can turn it on install a
trojan and turn it off again.
Suspend/Resume is supposed to work, many people find it useful. One non
suspend friendly driver makes every suspend aware driver on that
system useless so we really should be tight about suspend/resume.
