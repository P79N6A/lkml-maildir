Yes, which is fine for testing basic relocs, but misses some subtle issues.

Thanks for this.  It adds even more weight to your ET_DYN argument as well.
I'll need to play with that linker script some more (on PPC, binfmt_misc.o
is 13000 bytes, binfmt_misc.so becomes 156128 bytes 8)
There's still the issue of PPC and PPC64 which can only jump 24-bits away,
and so currently insert trampolines which have to be allocated with the
module, but that should be no uglier than currently.  (They could use a
special allocator, too, but with only 16M, they have to ensure noone else
uses those addresses).
PPC64 also frobs the TOC ptr (r2) in the trampolines: I don't have a
ppc64 box in front of me, but I imagine -shared will do the right thing
there too.
Thanks!
Rusty.
