sys_shmat() contains the following lines:
  /*
   * If shm segment goes below stack, make sure there is some
   * space left for the stack to grow (presently 4 pages).
   */
  if (addr < current->mm->start_stack &&
      addr > current->mm->start_stack - PAGE_SIZE*(shp->shm_npages + 4))
          goto out_unlock_up;
IMHO the test looks weird, is that really required?
* what if the stack is longer than 4 pages?
* what if the current process is multi-threaded?
* [the line is nearly identical to the test in linux-1.0.9]
Please help, I have not yet read the details of the mmap code.
Thanks,
	Manfred
