Couldn't you mark the FPU as unused for the duration of the
handler, and let the lazy FPU mechanism save the state when it is used
by the signal handler?

I use SEGVs to trap access to read-only pages for garbage collection,
and I know I'm not the only one.  That's a lot of SEGVs...
Fwiw, I have timed SIGSEGV handling time on Linux on various Intel CPUs,
on a PA-RISC running HP-UX and on a few Sparcs running Solaris.  Linux
came out faster in all cases.  Best case: 8 microseconds to trap a page
fault, handle the SEGV and mprotect() one page (600MHz P3).  Worst case:
37 microseconds (133MHz Pentium).
That's about 5000 cycles.  I'm sure we can do better than that.
For sophisticated user space uses, like the above, I'd like to see
a trap handling mechanism that saves only the _minimum_ state.
Userspace can take care of the rest.  Maybe even without a sigreturn in
some cases.
