I'd like to see this discussion focus on the technical issues. Why are
people constantly throwing up political arguments in this discussion ?
To answer your question: as you noticed, I did not yet contribute any
code to the SCST project. I'm an iSCSI/iSER/SRP user. I'd like to have
a SCSI target framework available on Linux that is as fast as
possible, as reliable as possible, as standards compliant as possible,
well maintained and for which all kernel code is integrated in the
mainstream Linux kernel. I'm probably sharing this desire with all
STGT, IET, SCST and LIO users. Do you consider the opinion of SCSI
target framework users irrelevant in this discussion ?
Bart.
