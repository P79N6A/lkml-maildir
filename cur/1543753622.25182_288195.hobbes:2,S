It won't be relevant if we move to a sched_clock() based timesource 
anyway, which looks to be the next major development for this.

The same timer is used for accounting of SCHED_NORMAL tasks, so if you 
can work around that you can DoS the system with even the correct 
combination of SCHED_NORMAL tasks. When Ingo implemented sched_clock all 
the architectures slowly came on board. If I recall correctly the lowest 
resolution one still had microsecond accuracy which is more than enough 
given the time a context switch takes.

Agreed; this is exactly what this work is about.
