Wierd it all looks okay to me (diffing the Xorg logs gives nothing
majorly different...)...
What desktop are you runnig on top of X? does it have any 3D or OpenGL
components in it?
if you just run X, does it always start to the X cursor without hanging..
Try disabling pre-empt also.. if you get a chance..
I've got the same chip on an evaluation card in my PC at the moment,
and I've been running the same X 6.8.2 on it for a while with no
issues on the latest kernels..
Dave.
