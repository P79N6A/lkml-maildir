OK - I updated the patches as Christoph suggested (removed 
hwgraph_path_lookup() from 000, removed
snia64_pci_find_bios() from 014, removed pcibr_businfo_get() from 030 
and dropped 071).
I took the reorg patch (075) out for now - I am reworking it along with 
our next set of patches.
So I think they are ready to go ?
