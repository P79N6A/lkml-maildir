yes, me too, we agree. And what I faced is that I couldn't do that
without first removing the broken mess. It wasn't possible to just make
a two liner to fix it.

It's not as simple as it seems, I noticed such a bug in the middle of
the developement and so it was controversial to fix, I should have fixed
the same bug first in the new VM then in the old vm, only the
free_pages_ok change would been non controversial but such one alone
would been useless since it wouldn't be self contained. so I did it for
my vm and I never ended splitting it off because it was non trivial work.
