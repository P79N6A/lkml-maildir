	Hi guys,
	I was using 2.3.43 (and all other recent 2.3.x) without observing this
	specific problem so it is something new to 2.3.44. I have not narrowed
	it down yet but the symptom is that I can't start any large programs
	(e.g. X) and can't compile almost anything, gcc randomly dies with
	SIGSEGV.
No problems here on UP (except LOTS of network stuff still not caught
up).
X, Netscape, Gimp, Xfig, and LyX, and gv all running fine at the same
time.
 (UP 96M, Mobile Pentium 233), gcc2.95.2, glibc2.1.2,
binutils-2.9.5.0.27
