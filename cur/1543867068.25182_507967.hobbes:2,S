Dear list,
As it turned out, not all worms eating nfnetlink_log have been exterminated
by my last patch series. I'll append next four patches to the end of the
series and I hope that it doesn't make your patching scripts unhappy.
Those patches fix two bugs and make two other code beautifications:
  11. procfs file handling - don't pass seq_file when you don't have to
* 12. nfulnl_recv_config() - don't modify what isn't there
* 13. __nfulnl_send() and friends - return your books timely
  14. __nfulnl_send() - don't prove the obvious
There are some other bugs I found that I'm looking for a fix. One of them
is wrong /proc/net/netfilter/nfnetlink_log contents:
natownica:~# cat /proc/net/netfilter/nfnetlink_log
    0  -4100     0 2 65535    100  1
    2  -4099     2 2 65535    100  2
    4  15355     0 2 65535    100  1
Those three entries are created by a single ulogd2 listening in three
packet logging groups. I believe that's some problem with generating
the file contents because after shutting down ulogd all disappear.
The two groups: 2, 4 are stuffed with packets by those iptables rules:
natownica:~# iptables-save |grep NFLOG
-A LOG_and_DROP_fakenet -m hashlimit --hashlimit 1/sec --hashlimit-mode \
	srcip --hashlimit-name fw_fakenet_src -j NFLOG --nflog-prefix \
	"fakenet" --nflog-group 2 --nflog-threshold 30
-A LOG_and_DROP_p2p -m hashlimit --hashlimit 1/sec --hashlimit-mode srcip \
	--hashlimit-name fw_p2p_src -j NFLOG --nflog-prefix "p2p" \
	--nflog-group 2 --nflog-threshold 30
-A invalid -m mark --mark 0x3000/0x3000 -j NFLOG --nflog-prefix \
	"nonregistered" --nflog-group 3
-A invalid -j NFLOG --nflog-prefix "invalid" --nflog-group 2
As you can see, there's no group 4 among the rules - 3 is. This seems to
be xt_NFLOG's fault, but I haven't looked there yet.
Greets,
Michal Miroslaw
