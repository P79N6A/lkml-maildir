Hi,
nice to see that the tpm framework was cleanned.

Why is it needed ?

Why not keep PnP ?

Why removing that ?
This will allow hotplug and udev to auto load the module.

No need to set mask, this is already done by pnp_port_start.
And I'll keep PNP instead of ACPI.

Can't you be coherent ?
why not using tpm_inf.addr
or TPM_INF_BASE ?

You should also do :
pnp_port_flags(device, 0) & IORESOURCE_DISABLED) in order to check the
resources.

Not coherent : acpi vs nothing.
Again prefer pnp instead of acpi.
