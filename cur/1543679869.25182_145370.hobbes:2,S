It is not a simpler operation. It is the patch.

The change is correct. Let it stand.

This change is also correct. Let it stand.

The precise thing this does is making phys_cpu_present_map an array
bounded by the APIC space. The change is correct. Let it stand.

The cpu bitmasks change width with NR_CPUS. The APIC ID spaces do not.
They must hence be bitmasks of separate widths. Hence the change is
correct. Let it stand.
