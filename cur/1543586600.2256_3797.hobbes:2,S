How about adding a config tag that gets spit out along an OOPS
message.  We could add a flag to ksymoops that would cause that
flag to be read and the corresponding .config info to get looked
up (mechanism to be determined).  This might reduce the chances
of "new kernel tester" reporting an OOPS but sending in the 
wrong .config data.
