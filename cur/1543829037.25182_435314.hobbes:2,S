Subject: [PATCH 15/22] [PATCH] Driver core: PM_DEBUG device suspend() messages become informative
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/6/21/363

From: David Brownell <david-b@pacbell.net>
This makes the driver model PM suspend debug messages more useful, by
  (a) explaining what event is being sent, since not all suspend()
      requests mean the same thing;
  (b) reporting when a PM_EVENT_SUSPEND call is allowing the device
      to issue wakeup events.
