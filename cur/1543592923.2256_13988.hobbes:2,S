	Each D-Link card has four MAC addresses (sequential).  I doubt
other manufactures are any different.

	What the guy was doing was having a bad case of optical rectitus.
That would be typical of a "reseller" (AKA Salesman).  Most would not
even have a CLUE that the cards were based on the tulip chipset / driver.
	Because the D-Link cards were less than half of the nearest
competitor [ < $180 vs > $360 for others and Compac was > $2400! ] I
ordered only three not knowing for sure if they would work.  Turned on
the tulip driver and them suckers fired right up.  Now I know they work,
stock, right out of the box, and I can order a bunch more for the lab
I'm working with.
