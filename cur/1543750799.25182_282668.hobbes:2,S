Unfortunately you're never going to find a rock to build your house
on. there is no rock, there is only shifting sand.

These things are harder and colder than "boredom" and the like can
influence. What you are dredging up does not actually exist.

Despite your appreciation the net effect is actually  irrelevance or
less.

SLES9 is a 2.6.x-based distro release from SuSE. It is in widespread
use by customers and customers are migrating to it en masse on account
of its 2.6.x basis due to 2.6.x'  superior performance and stability
characteristics. No "glowing praise" is necessary. This story tells itself.

Patterns of userspace usage that take down boxen are not "features" and
are never going to be considered valid aspects of "stable" releases.

Ockham. QED.

Now the everrever-changing definition of "stable" comes into play.
If you can't handle the baseline changing, freeze on a specific release.

They are not brave. They are the most cowardly people in existence.
They don't dare go on using 2.4.x because it can't handle the load,
because it can't hadle the bigger and newer machines, and because it
just doesn't work for them. It's not like they moved frivolously;
they're more terrified of migrating than even the most horrible bugs.
