Hi
I am proud to announce, as I am the new maintainer, the release of IPAcct
0.7d.
This is available from 
http://www.bigfoot.com/~useripacct/
   IPacct 0.7d introduces a new policy mechanism that provides per user
   IP statistics, that is, it just provides the user's IP usage. A user
   must be allowed to have IP, and a program is provided to control
   access to the IP level.
   This package adds per user ip accounting to the kernel and contains
   programs to control and use this accounting data.
   Fist of all it consists of a kernel patch which adds per user ip
   accounting to the kernel. The kernel patch accounts all bytes sent or
   received on the ip level, i.e. all headers get accounted including the
   ip header itself. This data is exported via the proc filesystem.
   Moreover the patch allows to control the ip access on a per user
   basis. Furthermore it is possible to specify a weight for ip
   addresses. This weight controls how much every byte costs that is
   transfered from or to this ip addresses. With this weight/cost set to
   zero you can ignore certain host or networks completely from the
   statistics which might be convenient for the local network. The cost
   can be different for different ip addresses.
   Second, there's a program for controlling and viewing the
   weights/costs and the accounting data produced by the kernel. With it
   you can modify the weight table in a manner very similar to the syntax
   of the route program.
Regards
Please send me any bug reports/ problems you have encountered with these
patches and I will be happy to advise.
