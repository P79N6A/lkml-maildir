Cool, sounds very useful.

I'm setting up a vm to play with this.  Will look into it.
Oh, looking at a few branches, I see that the patch for bug# 9247
(on bugzilla.kernel.org) isn't in 2.6.24-rc2 yet.  Can you check
whether the following patch fixes it?
thanks,

Subject: [PATCH 1/1] file capabilities: allow sigcont within session (v2.6.24-rc2)
Allow sigcont to be sent to a process with greater capabilities
if it is in the same session.  Otherwise, a shell from which
I've started a root shell and done 'suspend' can't be restarted
by the parent shell.
(this patch against v2.6.24-rc2)
