Subject: [patch 00/21] Highres / dynticks drop in replacement for 2.6.19-rc5-mm1
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Andrew,
this is a drop in replacement for the following patches in 2.6.19-rc5-mm1:
hrtimers-state-tracking.patch
up to
acpi-verify-lapic-timer-fix.patch
The patch set is taking all the changes made during the -mm testing into
account and merged them back at the appropriate places.
Changes vs. the initially reviewed patch set:
- Trivial compile / Kconfig fixes
- command line paramater fixups
- apic timer / ACPI (C states) broadcasting fixups
- Disabled apic timer for high res on UP systems due to the unsolvable
  brokeness of BIOS supplied C state functionality
- APIC code cleanup in i386
- reworked APIC timer calibration
Dropped from the rc5-mm1 patch conglomerate:
- the naive attempt to detect the local APIC timer brokeness in C2 state
  due to circular dependency on interrupts (where the local APIC timer
  interrupt might be the only active one). The problem is detectable, 
  but it needs more thought and the gathered information/experience is
  not lost ! Replaced by brute force for now.
Some annotations for making the review simpler:
