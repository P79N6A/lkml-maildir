The same FSF that wrote the GPL, no less ;-)

If he chose it for this reason, he chose the wrong license.  The GPL
does not funnel contributions back.  It doesn't even require anyone to
make contributions: you're free to keep your improvements only to
yourself.  And even if you distribute them, you can choose whom to
distribute it to, and that might very well leave the 'back' out.
