When writing rapidly using Toshiba Portege 4000 laptop keyboard, the
keypresses sometimes get doubled in X (so that instead of word 'doubled'
I get word 'ddoublled').
This seems to be hardware related. The keyboard controller seems to send
key release events often twice (so that about every fifth letter gets
doubled) but only when writing rapidly. It does not matter on Linux
console, but it makes X send X protocol key release events twice, which
makes some (or most) X programs to double keypresses. This is very
annoying.
I patched linux/drivers/char/keyboard.c to work around this (patch
included). If you have any better solutions or ideas I would be very happy
to hear about them.
Please CC comments to me, since I am not on the list.
