Hi all,
    I dont know if anybody used MRTG (Multi Router Traffic Grapher), but ive
been using it for a while and its a great tool, only after i upgraded my
kernel from 2.0.36 -> 2.2.5 none of the interfaces (buth ethernet & ppp)
show the graphs for outgoing traffic. Im using all the needed stuff for
2.2.5, CMU-SNMP-3.4, MRTG 2.72. Anyone notice the same thing, and/or
somebody know a solution?
Please help,
-AB-
