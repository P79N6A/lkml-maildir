That would seem to be a great shortcoming in fscache.
I guess as memory reclaim reaps the top-level dentries those file*'s will
also be freed up, leading to their dentries becoming reclaimable, leading
to their inodes being reclaimable.
But still.  Is it not possible to release those files-pinned-by-dcache when
the top-level files are closed?
