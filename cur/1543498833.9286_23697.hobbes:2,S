Well, Linus OKed FIFO patch, so now the obstacle to offloading fs-specific
portion of inode is gone. I'll start feeding the corresponding patches to
2.3 as soon as 2.3.7-pre will open. So we probably will have light-weight
inodes reasonably soon. As for dcache side - we are almost there. So
unionfs may show up in a month or so.
