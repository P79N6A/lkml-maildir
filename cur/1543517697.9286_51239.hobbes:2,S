Hi,
I have a few clarifications regarding the kernel code.
1) What is OOPS and when exactly does it occur?
2) When I call skb_copy(skb,GFP_KERNEL) in the kernel, I get the following error:
	allok_skb called nonatomically from <an address is specified here>
    This error is printed but I think the memory allocation is successful. Why does this error come.	
    Should I give the priority as GFP_ATOMIC. What exctly is the difference between the them.
Any tips in this regard will be great.
TIA and bye, 
Vinu
