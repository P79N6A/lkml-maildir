Hey guys,
I have been watching development of 2.4 since 2.4.2, I wonder wether
there would be reversion to old process where kernel source will be
solidified before starting development branch. Sysadmins where I work
are uneasy to move to linux from solaris, because of erratic changes
to the kernel such as replacement of the hardware monitoring code, rewriting
of network card drivers - all of which broke some or other software,
or simply did not work. I myself update kernel as time permits,
usually every 0.0.2+ I have spent nearly two days tracing problem
of my network, that ended up in source code of the driver that have
been radically changed for "better". Now I don't trust 2.4 line
kernel to work *at all*, so cautiously keep all old kernels in the /boot,
when upgrading.
It seems I am not only one and wonder if something will be done about that.
Regards,
p.
