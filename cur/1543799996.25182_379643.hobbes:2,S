Will do.

Fine.  There doesn't seem to be much consistency in whether to use
curlies for single-line blocks.

I don't know what you'd prefer, so let me enumerate a few alternatives,
and you can either tell me which you'd prefer, or point out something
I've missed that would be even better.  I'm entirely flexible on this.
      * Use the __HAVE_ARCH_* mechanism that include/asm-*/string.h
        uses.  Caveat: Linus has lately come out as hating this style.
        It makes for the smallest patch, though.
      * Define the generic code in lib/, and have each arch that really
        uses it export it.
      * Put generic code in include/asm-generic/algo-memcpy_toio32.h,
        and have each arch that needs it #include it somewhere and use
        it.
Have I missed anything?
