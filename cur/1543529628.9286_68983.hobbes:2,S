	I did not know that the kernel did autodetection (I thought
	you specified the parameters so you didn't have to pass them
	with lilo, for instance)? Can't you pass parameters to your
	kernel?
	I'm using a very old Sound Blaster 16 with support compiled as
	modules right now, playing a lot of MP3s and it is working
	like a champ (it's working for more than 1h straight now).
	I'm also having *no* problems with my old el cheapo NE2000
	card with support compiled as a module (it is interesting that
	I just saw someone complain a while ago about ne being broken
	as modules -- It's working fine). This machine is serving NFS
	for a client.
	PPP is also working very nice (I'm downloading more MP3s right
	now :-) and browsing nowebpatents.com).
	My machine is a UP Pentium MMX 200 (overclocked to 250), with
	a ALi 15x3 rev 0x20, multiword DMA (so I don't have to get
	André's Patches every time I compile a new kernel) and
	everything is working ok (let me cross my fingers -- I
	wouldn't like to have my filesystem eaten).
	The only "problems" that I have is that the well-known parport
	module having the broken dependencies and that the 2.3 kernels
	are getting a bit fat. :-( I have an old 486 DX 33 with only
	8MB of memory and at least 2.3.3x used to swap a lot on it. I
	haven't tested 2.3.51 on it yet.
	I still haven't tested how SCSI emulation is working (I
	haven't had time to burn any CDs today). But at least I'm not
	having a problem with a CD-R that I had in 2.3.48 that I could
	not read the last file of a CD (this problem appears to have
	gone in 2.3.49).
	Whew! I'm planning on testing reiserfs this Monday.
	So many things to test (perl 5.6, apache 2.0, X4.0, Linux
	2.4pre), so much work, so little time. :-)
	[]s, Roger...
