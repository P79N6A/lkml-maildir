You mean his question or your reply? His question is on-topic.

As he said, they are the POSIX (.1c) API for IPC. If you haven't even
heard of them, why answer?

I rather suspect he already knows the SysV API is there but is
interested in whether the POSIX API is supported. If I recall, someone
is gluing together an "IPC" filesystem which, together with some other
kernel additions (i.e. it's not simply a namespace issue) will get
the POSIX API working. I don't know, though, whether there's any hope
of it getting into 2.4: I haven't seen much mentioned on linux-kernel
or linux-mm recently so it's fairly late for 2.4 unless it's being
integrated silently.
