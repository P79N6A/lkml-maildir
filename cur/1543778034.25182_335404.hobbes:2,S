yes, you did miss my point.  I'm actually arguing that it's bad design
to attempt to arbitrate within a single shared user-space.  you make 
the fast path slower and less maintainable.  if you are really concerned
about isolating many competing servers on a single piece of hardware, then
run separate virtualized environments, each with its own user-space.
