Because the ifconfig says that the interface exists on that network
with that address. It does not say that packets may be routed out
through that interface. That is route's job. That is the way most
network engineers I know expect things to be.

Because sometimes you want an interface that doesn't have routes
through it? Why is this such a difficult concept? That is the
way the ISDN layer works for instance.

So it was moved in to the kernel?!? Great...

If you have a simple setup, yes. But if you have a simple setup
it was all done by init scripts anyway. If you have more involved
requirements then it just becomes confusing because things you
don't expect to happen, happen.

Or, possibly, your assumptions?
