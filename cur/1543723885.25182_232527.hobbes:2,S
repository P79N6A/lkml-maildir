Well, it seems it doesn't work for the .tmp_vmlinux1 object:
$ arm-linux-objdump --syms .tmp_vmlinux1 | egrep '^([^R]|R[^E]|RE[^G]).*\*UND\*'
00000000  w      *UND*  00000000 kallsyms_addresses
00000000  w      *UND*  00000000 kallsyms_num_syms
00000000  w      *UND*  00000000 kallsyms_names
$ arm-linux-nm .tmp_vmlinux1 | grep kallsyms_names
         w kallsyms_names
Seems we can't win either way. ;(
