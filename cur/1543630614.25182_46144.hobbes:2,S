Since this post never made it a couple days ago...
Which vaio bios was added to the tables? My grx still has problems with sound 
and such apparantly due to conflicts.
Also on my GRX - the console acts wierd with framebuffer, when text reaches 
the bottom of a console it nearly freezes the machine.
