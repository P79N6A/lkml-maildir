In cases where developer time (or time to market) is at a premium and the
problems at hand require some kind of modular parallelism.  I have a
program on my desk that can run >20 active threads on a one CPU machine.
Given the problem(s) we had to solve with it, threads saved us many
man-months of development effort and were the right answer.  I can imagine
that other developers have the same sorts of quandaries (or would if they
understood how threads could help them).
