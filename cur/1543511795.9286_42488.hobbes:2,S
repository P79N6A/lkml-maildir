Yes, furthermore there is a kernel-headers package for each kernel
that ships with Debian which _does_ include config.h and version.h
But this is a kernel list, and this discussion has no place here.
What is relevant though is that you will note that Linus took out
the part about linking /usr/include/{linux,asm} to
/usr/src/linux/include from the linux/README file in 2.2. That was
most certainly not taken out without reason.
