Sounds like the third best solution:
  best: rearrange configuration such that the structure is clear, easy
    to understand, and no conflicts can arise (only problem: may be
    impossible ;-)
  2nd best: catch conflicts in the configuration editor and let users
    resolve them there
  3rd best: catch them outside of the editor and use a different
    procedure to resolve them
The 3rd best may still be better than nothing at all, provided that there
is a useful migration path to a more integrated solution.
