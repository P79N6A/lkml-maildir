Nice to find someone that takes there computers as seriously as I do :) I've just got
periscope at the moment (student's aren't made of money unfortunately... :) However, I hope
to at least upgrade periscope to 750 Mhz or 1Ghz asap (when available) probably have a dual
Athlon if it is affordable cos I really really want one (no PIIIs - stupid intel lost my
confidence when they added the PSN). Anyway, I still think it's worth considering that there
might possibly be a kernel situation which doesn't best integrate with our hardware (there,
I said it - without actually saying there is a problem :) I just hope someone notices these
posts and looks into what is causing it - I HAVE NO LOGS on the issue because there is no
fault, oopps, or whatever, it happens and thats all.
