Dear sir/madam,
     do accept my sincere apologies if my mail does not 
meet your personal ethics.i will introduce myself as viera ford, a 
staff in the accounts management section of a well-known bank here in 
the south africa.one of our accounts with holding balance of(thirty 
million british dollars) has been dormant and has not been operated for 
the past 4 years.from my investigations and confirmations, the owner of 
this account a foreigner by name 
austin martins died in august 2000 
and since then nobody has done anything as regards the claiming of this 
money because he has no family members who are aware of the existence 
of neither the account nor the funds. 
           also information from 
the national immigration states that he was also single on entry into 
the sa.i have secretly discussed this matter with some of the bank 
officials and we have agreed to find a reliable foreign partner to deal 
with. we thus propose to do business with you, standing in as the next 
of kin of these funds from the deceased and funds released to you after 
due processes have been followed.
     this transaction is totally free 
of risk and troubles as the fund is a legitimate and does not originate 
from drug, money laundry, terrorism or any other illegal act. on your 
interest, let me hear from you.
regards,
viera
