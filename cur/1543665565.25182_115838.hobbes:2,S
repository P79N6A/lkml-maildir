In a distributed system everything happens on a branch.

I don't know, if the problem really changes that much.  How do
you pick a globally unique inode number for a file?  And then
how do you reconcile this when people on 2 different branches create
the same file and want to merge their versions together?
So as a very rough approximation.
- Distribution is the problem.
- Powerful branching is the only thing that helps this
- Non branch local data (labels/tags) is very difficult.
