Hi Ingo, I finally have a rebuilt kernel with latency tracing enabled, a
jackd with the proper prctl incantations built in and I'm getting some
(hopefully) meaningful data. 
I'm running a script that samples /etc/latency_trace every second and
logs the maximums to a file. 
First attachment: jackd running 2x128 @48KHz, idle (no clients). Ignore
the first trace (leftover from a previous run). After the first three
triggered latencies I added a task doing a "tar cf usr.tar /usr" to see
what disk i/o load would do. 
Second attachment: jackd + ams + japa + disk i/o
Are these good for anything?
[Maybe I need to just enable tracing all the time instead of just
tracing inside the jack client loop?]
