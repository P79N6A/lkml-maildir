I am currently also hunting in this area, and I think there is something 
strange in generic_file_aio_read(). This seems strange:
	for (seg = 0; seg < nr_segs; seg++) {
		read_descriptor_t desc;
		desc.written = 0;
		desc.arg.buf = iov[seg].iov_base;
		desc.count = iov[seg].iov_len;
		if (desc.count == 0)
			continue;
		desc.error = 0;
                        
		do_generic_file_read(filp,ppos,&desc,file_read_actor);
		retval += desc.written;
		if (desc.error) {
			retval = retval ?: desc.error;
			break;
		}
	}
So this code propagates desc.error back to caller _only if_ all of the 
previous segments had desc.written == 0. Which is bogus - we need to 
propagate -EIOCBRETRY as soon as any of the do_generic_file_read() 
returned it, so that the caller is aware of requests being queued.
I think something like this would be appropriate
[PATCH] AIO: handle return value from do_generic_file_read() properly
generic_file_aio_read() doesn't always propagate error return value from 
do_generic_file_read(). Namely handling of -EIOCBRETRY is important, because
aio_run_iocb() relies on this return value being always properly propagated
to it.
