Hi Dave,
  I think the problem is this:
 hd0,0 is /dev/hda1.  Your kernel is in /dev/hda3.
You want to have hd0,2, not hd0,0.  As for the output
you see.  You must have a kernel at /dev/hda1 that does
not support XFS and hence the unknown fs error.
Please fix your grub entry and you should have fun.
Dave
