# [PATCH] add touch_atime() helper
# 
# Preparation for per-mountpoint noatime, nodiratime and later -
# per-mountpoint r/o.  Depends on file_accessed() patch, should go after
# it.
# 
# New helper - touch_atime(mnt, dentry).  It's a wrapper for
# update_atime() and that's where all future per-mountpoint checks will
# go.
static inline void touch_atime(struct vfsmount *mnt, struct dentry *dentry)
{
        /* per-mountpoint checks will go here */
        update_atime(dentry->d_inode);
}
Hum, so that is what you call 'moving the callers upstream'
instead of 'propagating vfsmounts downstream' ...
best,
Herbert
