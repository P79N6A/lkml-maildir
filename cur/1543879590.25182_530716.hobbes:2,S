It should be easy to restrict a crypto device so that it's used
by one specific user.  That's why we have generic names ("aes") vs.
specific ones ("aes-foo").
So if you let the priority user pick "aes-foo" instead of "aes",
and given that there is a higher priority variant of the generic
"aes" registered, the system will do exactly what you want.
The only part missing right now is the ability to change the priority
of an algorithm so that for example you can let "aes-generic" take
priority over "aes-padlock", but that should be fairly easy to add.
Cheers,
