Running the nptl tests from nptl-0.60 my machine
regularly freezes (SysRq keys not working any more)
and/or panics and outputs the following (or similar)
on the console:
...
do_page_fault+0x12c/0x454
poke_blanked_console+0x5c/0x70
try_to_wake_up+0xa7/0x160
default_wake_function+0x2a/0x30
__wake_up_common+0x31/0x60
do_page_fault+0x0/0x454
error_code+0x2d/0x38
do_exit+0x1d2/0x350
do_page_fault+0x0/0x454
die+0xe1/0xf0
do_page_fault+0x12c/0x454
sys_exit+0x13/0x20
syscall_call+0x7/0xb
Code: 8b 5d 68 c7 44 24 20 01 00 03 00 8b 50 14 8b 00 81 e2 ff ff
<6>note: ld-linux.so.2[2069] exited with preempt_count 1
I have omitted the absolute addresses. The part between the
`do_page_fault+0x12c/0x454' entries repeats again and again
scrolling off the screen so I cannot see the beginning of the
message.
I experienced similar crashes with 2.6.0-test6 and 2.6.0-test6-mm4
also for 2.6.0-test6-mm4 the stacktrace looked different (see my
earlier post).
Machine is a single processor Athlon XP 2000+, 768MB RAM. Kernel was 
compiled with gcc-3.3.1. Preempt is enabled.
