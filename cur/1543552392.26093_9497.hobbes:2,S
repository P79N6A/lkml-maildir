   Is the Linux behavior even consistent with POSIX?  You are saying
   that SOCK_DGRAM behaves fundamentally differently for local
   connections than for remote ones; in particular, the latter *do not
   block* while the former do.  Even if this is standard, it ought to
   be documented better...
I did not say whether such calls block or not, during memory
allocation they might.
Look, show me how memcpy() can drop a packet and then we can continue
on about whether SOCK_DGRAM on AF_UNIX should behave one way or the
other ok?  :-) Because this is all that AF_UNIX is, memcpy, like a
pipe.  Therefore, the reliability distincion between
SOCK_DGRAM/SOCK_STREAM has no meaning for AF_UNIX sockets.
