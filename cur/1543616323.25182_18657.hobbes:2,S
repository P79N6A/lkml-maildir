Hey, reserving some space in superblock won't hurt.
And when actual reiserfsprogs and util-linux support will appear, people will just start to use these features.
On the other side, if tools supporting this stuff will get out earlier than kernel support, bad things may happen.
And Hans is thinking that time for this patch is right, too.
