I didn't condone the "illegal" export, I merely refused to congratulate Trond
for not using the code that was already exported.
BTW, a legal route for this might have been through Canada:
	
http://insight.mcmaster.ca/org/efc/pages/doc/crypto-export.html
which chronicles the successful, sanctioned export from Canada to England of
MIT Kerberos V5, beta 5 on a floppy disk. 
So I may owe the ftp site maintainer an apology for terming his acquisition as
illegal. Only he knows.
