Depends entirely on your hardware.

It is neccessary as the user space virtual memory will be fragmented in
physical space (unless you are using MMUless Linux when it will be far
less fragmented).
If the platform is an MMUless one then you can fill in the host
structure and indicate that you support a maximum scatter gather list
size of one. This will break up I/O's when neccessary to keep within
that limit but this will hurt your performance by causing a lot more
requests on a non MMUless system.
