Here is the quick fix for this in RH 2.1AS kernels:
http://www.kernelnewbies.org/kernels/rh21as/SOURCES/linux-2.4.9-moreunnamed.patch
It makes unnamed block devices use majors 12, 14, 38, 39, as well as 0. 
I don't know if anyone is working out a better scheme for 
get_unnamed_dev in 2.6 yet.  It does need to be done though.  A simple 
patch for 2.6 would maybe see the unnamed_dev_in_use bitmap grow to 
PAGE_SIZE, automatically allowing for 32768 unnamed devices.
