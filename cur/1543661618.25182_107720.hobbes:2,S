In this case fs/Kconfig went from 1 entry of FS_POSIX_ACL to 2 of
them.  And the original one didn't contain any text after "bool",
so it wasn't presented to the user as a config option.
I.e., it's a derived (generated) config option value.
So the one with 'bool "FS_POSIX_ACL"' should be removed IMO.
It's confusing, especially without any 'help' text, which isn't
needed when it's hidden.

Yes, I would just leave this part as is for now and try go get
it merged based on feedback so far.

OK, that can be done separately (if at all).
