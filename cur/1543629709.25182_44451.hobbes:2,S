not a good example, that is been cleanedup in latest tux releases,
there's no tux specific code anymore in the dcache:
	
ftp://ftp.us.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/kernels/v2.4/2.4.19pre8aa2/60_tux-vfs-5
there are still a a few lines of tux in the task struct and the socks
but it doesn't really matter to the non tux users, and it obviously
cannot affect stability in any way.
