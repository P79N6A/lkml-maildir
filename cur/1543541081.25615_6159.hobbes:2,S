Definitely needed.

All of the above :)  I think regression and stress are the two most
important ones, but that's just one opinion..

IMHO regression, then stress testing.  Regression testing provides more
stability of interface and code in the long run.  Stress testing tools
tend to focus on a few specific areas of the code, and be completely
inadequate for covering certain cases.

Each vendor and kernel developer seems to have their own favorite set of
tests; the building of a unified test suite should include many of these
tests.  VA Linux's Cerebus (sp?) and Juan Quintela's MM tests are good
examples.
