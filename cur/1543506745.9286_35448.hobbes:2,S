Hello.  I've found my problem, or at least a solution to it.  It's
negative dcache entry cacheing.  I have a simple fix that I'd like to
see implemented.  Note that this is against the 2.2.10 kernel, but I
believe it exists in the 2.2.11 and others from some of the traffic
I'm seeing.
Basically, when I mount with the "noac" option, I expect all attribute
caching to be disabled, including negative dcache entries.  So, this
simple fix below does that, and solves my problems I'm having in this
area (strange NFS "things". :) )
