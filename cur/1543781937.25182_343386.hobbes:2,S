You're right, this problem seems much, much better in Xorg 6.8.2.  I
think the Damage extension might be responsible.  There's definitely
something different happening because when I switch windows quickly,
instead of a grey box that gets slowly re-packed with widgets, I see a
black box that packs very fast, and seems to be filled in large
rectangular chunks rather than one widget at a time.  X is also using a
lot less CPU.  Very nice work...
