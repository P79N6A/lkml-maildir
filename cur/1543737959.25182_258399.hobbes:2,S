Hi Chuck,
We don't usually make a 4th point in our versions, the next version
after 2.6.8 would usually be 2.6.9, which will come out in due course.
2.6.8.1 was released because there was a 1-line error in 2.6.8 that
completely stopped NFS from working.
The patches mentioned below will probably go into 2.6.9 or something, if
they have been approved for it etc.
Hope that clears it up.
Cheers,
Trent
