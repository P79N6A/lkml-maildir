I have answers now to the questions:
Wine has to support allocating thread pointers for NT processes in 
ntdll, so it needs a way to allocate descriptors.  It doesn't seem to 
care if they are LDT or GDT descriptors.

It does not know.  And DOSemu appears to only use LDT.  GDT is used to 
allocate a global thread area for Wine, but it has a fallback mechanism 
that appears to have been built from the start to deal with varying 
thread selectors rather than a fixed notion (as GDT TLS segments are not 
available on 2.4).  Rather convenient.
Now the million dollar question is : who uses three TLS segments?  Wine 
appears to use glibc, private, and I have no idea what other software 
makes use of this.  If only two thread selectors were needed, then this 
does the trick.  Or we could rebase the selectors down to 0x20-0x30.
 *  ------- start of TLS (Thread-Local Storage) segments:
 *
 *   6 - TLS segment #1                 [ glibc's TLS segment ]
 *   7 - TLS segment #2                 [ Wine's %fs Win32 segment ]
 *   8 - BIOS real mode segment
