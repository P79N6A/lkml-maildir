Hardware is Intel 82865G (integrated) with DRM i915 1.1.0 20040405 and 
xorg-3.8.2 i810 driver, running at nice 0, priority 15.  Should I bump the 
priority up?  To realtime?

Disabling the dri and drm modules didn't help.  I'll turn on NoAccel when 
I'm back in the office on Tuesday.

So would running X through the framebuffer device be the way to go for 
stability under realtime?  It's been a couple years since I've used fb.
