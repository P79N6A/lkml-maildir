This is true, but the major problem comes of upgrading and compatibility
issues with old versions of LVM, etc. The usual stuff, IMHO.

I'm not sure what you're saying here. EVMS is good, but I believe that
LVM and EVMS serve two different purposes, mainly with regard to the
type of environments each is used in. 
I've attempted to contact Heinz twice, I hope he responds about this
soon. I like LVM for it's simplicity, and ease of use. Simple tools, and
methods that get the job done.
