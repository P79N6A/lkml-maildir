Pardon the interruption, but, after browsing LinuxHQ and a few other
locations, I need some assistance.
In order to get Informix IDS up and running, a series of kernel patches
were required, primarily, it appears, allow each instance of IDS to
open a large number of file descriptors, something like 3000+ or so.
I'm trying to determine if these patches, which were made available for
the 2.0.36 kernel for RedHat and SuSE: 
1)  Have been integrated into the 2.2.x kernel;
2)  At what patch-level they were integrated;
3)  Other relevant information related thereto;
I'd be happy with pointers to relevant README's.  Thanks and regards,
