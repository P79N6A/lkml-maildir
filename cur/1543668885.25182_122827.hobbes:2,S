Have you looked at: LKMB (Linux Kernel Module Builder)
Try google at bit after it. An URL has been posted here a couple of times.
There is also: DKMS: Dynamic Kernel Module Support
Gary Lerhaupt from Dell has mede this and he would be glad for any feedback.
In general I advice you to use:
$ make -C path/to/kernel/src SUBDIRS=$PWD modules
when building modules. That's the _only_ way to make sure you have correct
CFLAGS etc.
This should work for 2. as weel as 2.5.
The Makefile than has to be kbuild conformant, as described in
Documentation/kbuild/makefiles.txt
