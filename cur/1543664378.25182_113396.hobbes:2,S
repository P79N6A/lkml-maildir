Sorry for the confusion: I *did* have two mouse input devices configured on XF86Config: one for my 
Intellimouse mouse and another one for the laptop built-in PS/2 mouse. What is really curious is that the PS/2 
touchpad wasn't working as it's modules wasn't loaded and neither /dev/psmouse nor /dev/psaux where 
generating any input events. 
 
Thanks to all!
