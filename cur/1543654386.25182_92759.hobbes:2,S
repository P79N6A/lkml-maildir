Hmm, with 2.5.50 and module-init-tools 0.8a two "modules.*map" files
are created -- but they're empty.  That's with the latest 2.5 modutils
   
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rusty/modules/
So that's not quite working yet.  I should clarify that this hasn't
been the only stumbling block for usb in recent kernels ... looks
as if some of the others (like "re-plugging" issues seemingly in
driver model code) may be gone, but this modutils-based regression
is particularly visible.
