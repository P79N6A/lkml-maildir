Dear All,
I have a doubt about __get_dma_pages. When I am trying to allocate the
memory to a DMA buffer using the __get_dma_pages it is failed. 
I am using the 2.4.18-3 kernel version? 
The System contains 128MB RAM. I tried with 256MB RAM also.
What are the reasons to fail the __get_dma_pages call?
Please give me some hints or advices or any links that are related to
it.
Thanks in advance.
Regards,
Srinivas G
