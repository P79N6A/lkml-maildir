Making an allyesconfig-kernel doesn't work. There's a problem in
fs/cramfs/inode.c:
[per@linus linux-2.5.66]$ make mrproper; make allyesconfig; make
fs/cramfs/inode.c: In function `get_cramfs_inode':
fs/cramfs/inode.c:54: incompatible types in assignment
make[2]: *** [fs/cramfs/inode.o] Error 1
make[1]: *** [fs/cramfs] Error 2
make: *** [fs] Error 2
It seems to be this line:
inode->i_mtime = inode->i_atime = inode->i_ctime = 0;
inode->i_{m,a,c}time are 'struct timespec' not integers.
Changing the line to the following solves it, but is perhaps not the best
solution:
inode->i_mtime = inode->i_atime = inode->i_ctime = ((struct timespec) {0,
0});
