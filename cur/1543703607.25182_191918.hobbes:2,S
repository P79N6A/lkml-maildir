Read Documentation/CodingStyle.  It is loosely based on the original
K&R style, where (the scarce) language constructs' arguments' opening
parenthese is prepended by a space, whereas with functions and macros
it is not.  I.e., one writes 'if (...)', 'while (...)', 'foo(bar)', etc.
Also, your explicit casts could use extra whitespace, like so:
"a = (int *) b;" not "a = (int *)b;"
When submiting code to an existing file, the general rule of thumb
is not to disrupt the style of that particular file, regardless
of what it appears to be.  You have managed to break this rule
_and_ the official CodingStyle.
