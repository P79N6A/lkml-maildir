Well, I don't know about that so much; I've always thought Linus bears a 
striking resemblance to Mickey Mouse.
More to the point though -- could you please consider just going away for at 
least a month? Subscribers to this list just sat through a massive licensing 
flamefest and could at this point sort of do without a (delayed) bitkeeper, 
development branch, stable API and reiser4 one.
Deal? See you in a month?
Thanks in advance!
Rene.
