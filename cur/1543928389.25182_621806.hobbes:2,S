Well, on my laptop, I'm currently dragging along 3 out-of-tree kernel modules.
2 are well-known binary blobs so it's between me and the vendor, as usual.
The third is a USB webcam driver that happened to get caught at the wrong
end of the colorspace-conversion-in-kernel bunfight in the V4L playpen.
Somebody wants to figure out how to get the gspca drivers into the kernel,
they're at 
http://mxhaard.free.fr/download.html
 waiting for attention. ;)
(Don't look at *me*, I don't understand the code, or the bunfight - I just
happen to have one of the 244 supported webcams, and it works with that driver)
