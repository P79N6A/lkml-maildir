Hang on.  I wasn't thinking clearly.  mmiowb() only ensures the write
has got as far as the shub.  There's no way to fix this in the pci core
-- any PCI-PCI bridge can reorder the two.
This is only really a problem for setup (when we program the BARs), so
it seems silly to enforce an ordering at any other time.  Reluctantly, I
must disagree with Jeff -- drivers need to fix this.
