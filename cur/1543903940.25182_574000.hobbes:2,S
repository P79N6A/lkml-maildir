Setup was a pain, but maintenance hasn't been too bad.  Most changes
don't deeply alter the code structure.  After major surgery I diff the
documentation output to check I haven't broke anything major (eg.
removed a title or a section terminator).

Yeah, code documentation like this belongs in comments IMHO, and even
there it can rot.
