This patch (in its incarnation in our SLE10SP2 tree) is causing resource
allocation failures on one of my machines. The condition for this is that
besides ROMs behind a bridge not having their base addresses assigned
there's no extra space available in the non-prefetch window to
accommodate the ROMs' space. I therefore think the change, while
having a good reason, isn't complete so far, as it would imply the need
for checking whether space in the non-prefetch window is sufficient and
continuing to force the creation of a prefetch window otherwise.
