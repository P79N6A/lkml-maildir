Actually they apparently took effect on Wednesday January 12:

Note this paragraph:
: Global Exports of Unrestricted Encryption Source Code 
: 
: Encryption source code which is available to the public and which is
: not subject to an express agreement for the payment of a licensing fee
: or royalty for commercial production or sale of any product developed
: with the source code may be exported under a license exception without
: a technical review. The exporter must submit to the Bureau of Export
: Administration a copy of the source code, or a written notification of
: its Internet location, by the time of export.  Foreign products made with
: the unrestricted source code do not require review and classification by
: the U.S.  Government for reexport. This license exception should apply
: to exports of most "open source" software.

 to be precise.
While I agree with the EFF position that there are still significant
problems with the export regulations and that further changes are
desirable, I believe that the new regulations now in place already permit
encryption to be included in the standard Linux kernels as I suggested.
Share and enjoy the crypto,
