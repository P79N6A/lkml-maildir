Subject: [PATCH] uvesafb: don't treat valid modes returned by fb_find_mode() as errors

Don't treat valid modes returned by fb_find_mode() (best-fit modes,
default modes or the first valid mode) as errors.
Currently, when fb_find_mode() finds a valid mode belonging to one
of the above-mentioned classes, uvesafb will ignore it and will try
to set a 640x480 video mode.  The expected behaviour (introduced by
this patch) would be to use the valid mode returned by fb_find_mode()
instead.

As requested, this patch contains an expanded changelog message.  The
bug is by no means critical and should have no impact on the large
majority of users, so it's definitely not 2.6.24 material.
