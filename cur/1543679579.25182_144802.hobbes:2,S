I agree on having arch-specific implementations in crypto/arch directories.
However, I've got some problems with having this kind of 'static' aliasing
in modules.conf. In my case I do not know beforehand, whether a specific
crypto instruction is enabled. I query some processor status flags during
runime. If the check fails, I'd like to switch back to the original
software implementation.
I read in your autoconf.c file that a more sophisticated version of
crypto_alg_autoload is planned. I would suggest first trying to load the
arch-specific aes_z990.ko in crypto_alg_autoload. In my init_module
function i could query the processor. If init_module for my implementation
fails -> request_module fails -> load the standard module aes.ko.
Something similar to this:
#ifndef CRYPTO_ARCH      //defined in arch makefile as "_z990"
#define CRYPTO_ARCH ""
#endif
void crypto_alg_autoload(const char *name)
{
      if (request_module("%s%s", name, CRYPTO_ARCH) != 0){
            request_module("%s", name);
      }
}
