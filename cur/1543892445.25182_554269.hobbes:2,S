Hi...
I have compiled the 2.6.22-rc4 kernel with the mm1 patchset.
It works fine for my z16m lenovo laptop. The only mistake I have is
the iwlwifi driver for the Intel Corporation PRO/Wireless 3945ABG
network controller. The bitrate settings are sometimes very different.
Sometimes it says 6 Mb/s, sometimes 11 Mb/s or 54 Mb/s and maybe 
sometimes 5.5 Mb/s.
The other thing is the message in log:
wlan0: duplicate address detected!
I have no machine with the same address in my network and no other
accesspoint in the range of my wlan.
With the 2.6.22.3 kernel and the iwp3945 driver the bitrate settings 
only 54 Mb/s and the message never found in logs.
Thanks
Mario
