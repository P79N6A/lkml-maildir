Yes, sounds like race. It seems locking isn't quite right in tmpfs.
BTW, I'd like to know why do you want to use temporary storage
(tmpfs/shm/ramdisk) for /var and /etc? In 'normal' Unix (i.e. not a special
setup like computing farm) they are expected to survive reboot. Only /tmp
is volatile. You want to keep per-workstation config files (/etc) and data
(/var) across reboot, right?
Since my workstations aren't overstuffed with RAM, I use server supplied
storage for everything. If I will have a multigig RAM box someday, I'll
use tmpfs *only* for /tmp.
