sorry the kernel version is 2.4.3-ac12, so it's kind of latest...
I was using mpg123 (xmms and c/o does exactly the same)
if I run it like this Moby sounds very stupid... :)
[root@whyami mp3]# mpg123 -r 48000 Moby_01.wav.mp3 
unsupported playback rate: 44100
Audio device open for 44.1Khz, stereo, 16bit failed
Trying 44.1Khz, 8bit stereo.
unsupported sound format: 32
Audio device open for 44.1Khz, stereo, 8bit failed
Trying 48Khz, 16bit stereo.
Cheers
