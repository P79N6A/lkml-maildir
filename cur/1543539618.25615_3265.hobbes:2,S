I know that. The problem was more that we needed a hub with both 
BNC and RJ45. As we did not have something like that we used a notebook
to provide a router to the BNC internal network. 
If we had a hub with support for both network cables we would have
been able to get official IPs for all of the systems per DHCP.

As you can see it was not possible in this case :)

Sorry, forgot about that *arg*
We were using kernel 2.2.15 with two ne2k compatible cards. Anyway, the 
problem magically went away after reboot. I can only guess that it was 
a problem with the pcmcia bus of that notebook. 
Thanks for your help
