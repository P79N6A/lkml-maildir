I was originally hoping to get something into this merge window, but  
the timing just isn't working out for me.  The rest of the support is  
already in the kernel for ppc (actually, most everything is in  
2.6.28), and swiotlb is the last bit I need to get this working.   Ah  
well.... I'll hop to work on this from the ppc point of view as soon  
as I get back online, and we'll see where that takes us.
Thanks!
