No, no.
The debugger is akin to giving the _rabbits_ a bazooka. The poor wolf
doesn't get any sharper teeth.
Yeah, it sure helps against wolves. They explode in pretty patterns of
read drops flying _everywhere_. Cool.
But it doesn't help against a rabbit gene pool that is slowly
deteriorating because there is nothing to keep them from breeding, and no
darwin to make sure that it's the fastest and strongest that breeds.
You mentioned how NT has the nicest debugger out there. 
Contemplate it.
