This test won't exercise the IO scheduler at all - in any kernel.
It only gets 1 read request at a time. Any differences you see
might be due to something happening in the background or just
random variations. If you want to see AS really work, do something

do dd if=/dev/zero of=./temp bs=1M count=(the size of your ram);
done
