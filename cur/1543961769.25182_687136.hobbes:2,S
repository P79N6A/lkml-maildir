Yes, from the usability POV, select is better.

Indeed.  The problem is that the select doesn't (can't?) resolve the
dependecy in a reverse way.  For example, select VIDEO_V4L1 won't turn
on the dependent items such as VIDEO_DEV, VIDEO_V4L2_COMMON,
VIDEO_ALLOW_V4L1, so and so.
Thus, when another dependency is added to the selected target, it can
easily break the depdency chain like this case...
