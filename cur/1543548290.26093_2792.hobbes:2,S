Yes, if you look at /proc/partitions, you'll find that all scsi disks are
duplicated. This confuses LVM and it doesn't activate any VG that contains
partitons on SCSI drives. 
If you comment out the last two lines of sd.c (module_init....) LVM works
again. I don't know if this may cause other problems, but I'm just running
such a patched -test8 kernel.
