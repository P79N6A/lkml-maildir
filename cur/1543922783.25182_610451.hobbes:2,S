Right, that's what I was thinking.  But I haven't tried it, so I'll
take your word for it that it's ugly.

I want to try hard to avoid making ACPI a special case in this way.
The current /proc/io{ports,mem} contains reservations for everything
else.  I'd hate to have to look two places just because of ACPI.

Right.  Actually my patch requests resources of all active PNP devices,
not just ACPI.  Glad we didn't do overlapping work here :-)

Thanks for the preview.  No hurry as far as I'm concerned.
