Wonder why....
[Fixing bugs in the $FOO driver or the $BAR filesystem is /easy/, fixing
 bugs in "fundamental behaviour changes" is /extremely hard/.]

Because that kind of problems are isolated. If you introduce a change that
affects /all/ filesystems, and that change later on has unfixable bugs, or
fundamental design issues, it is /a lot/ of work.

Great!
