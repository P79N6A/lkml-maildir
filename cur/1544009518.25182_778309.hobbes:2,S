one hiccup, Arjan recently added functionality to the kernel that could

Hi Hitoshi,
you probably want to download and install our ethregs utility.
http://prdownloads.sf.net/e1000/ethregs-1.1.tar.gz
(this is not a direct link as it seems but gets redirected to a mirror
page, usually)
Please let me know if it doesn't support your device ID.
