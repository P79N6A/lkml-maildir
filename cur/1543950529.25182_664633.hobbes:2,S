Well, can it happen in practice?  If it can, then what way can it happen?

For any other uses than in device_pm_add(), the list_empty(&dpm_active) test
should be sufficient, IMHO.
It seems to me that we're discussing purely academic stuff here.  If it turns
out to be of any practical relevance, it will be trivial to add the handling of
it in the future.
