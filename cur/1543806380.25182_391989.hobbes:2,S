Perhaps a generic solution isn't feasible, because this isn't really a
generic problem. The LED stuff has very limited use - you mention
embedded platforms, perhaps they should just be doing this on their own?
Generally I'm finding a hard time justifying an LED api, honestly. It
just feels like one of those things where the actual abstraction ends up
being a lot bigger than code needed. Abstracting and creating an API
isn't always useful.
