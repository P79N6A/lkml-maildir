Have you tried running other large memory hogging applications instead of
X ?
The oopses vary a fair bit althoug the unix_poll one is a common theme.
There aren't really any obvious candidates for hangs in unix_poll either.
It doesn't really have loops in it.
My first suspicion is the Xserver. Its privileged enough to crash the box.
Can you duplicate the problem if you run X with acceleration disabled ?
