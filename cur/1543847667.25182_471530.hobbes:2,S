Actually, if you want to guarantee the size of an integer variable with gcc,
you can do, for example, this:
	typedef int __attribute__((mode(SI))) siint;
which creates a 32-bit signed integer type called "siint".
The "mode" attribute is parameterised with one of the following values to
indicate the specific size of integer required:
	QI	8-bit
	HI	16-bit
	SI	32-bit
	DI	64-bit
	TI	128-bit
