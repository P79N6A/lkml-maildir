It is GPL, it is for Linux, it is both faster and slower than ext2
depending on the aspect of performance you measure, on the whole I think
it is faster if only because when ext2 is slower, it is often slower by
an order of magnitude (e.g. ext2 is not effective for large directories). 
It is intended to make it feasible to add database and hypertext
functionality into the filesystem.  The first step in doing that is
making the storage of both small files and large directories efficient.
We are currently being paid by an Internet search engine company to add
keyword search features into the filesystem.
It is thought to be fully stable now, it runs all benchmarks we know to
run without crashing, please find bugs.:-)
It is fully described at
