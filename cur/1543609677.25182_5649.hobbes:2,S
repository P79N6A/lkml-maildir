The latest version is always available at 
http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/cml2/
Release 1.8.4: Tue Nov 13 17:31:15 EST 2001
	* Resync with 2.4.15-pre4 (except for SH port).
	* Rulebase corrections from Keith Owens and Colin Slater.
	* DANGEROUS is now a warndepend condition; this means there is a policy
	  symbol DANGEROUS, and any symbol dependent on it will show DANGROUS
	  in its legend.
	* Visibility improvement from Romain BEAUGRAND.
	* Complete coverage check -- CML1 fossil symbols eliminated.
	* Matthieu Verbert's configtrans.py fix.
CML2 is now fully caught up with the CML1 rulebase in the most current
kernel version, with symbol coverage mechanically checked in both directions.
