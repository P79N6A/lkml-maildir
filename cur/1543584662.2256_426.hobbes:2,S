See my previous email ...  its behavior contradicts its spec,
and I'd sent a patch.  You said you wanted kmalloc to have
an "automagic redzoning" feature, which would involve one
more change (to the flags used in kmalloc init when magic
redzoning is in effect).  I'd expected a response.

Exactly why I think we need a usable solution changing that
half!  And why I asked for feedback about the API, not a
focus on this particular implementation.

To see who was awake, of course!  That shouldn't be there.

Some hardware (like OHCI) talks to drivers using those dma handles.
