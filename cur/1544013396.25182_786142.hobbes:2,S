The leap second isn't a simple thing like a time zone.  Zones account
for an offset from UTC, but a leap second is an extra second inserted
into (or possibly removed from) UTC itself.  There was actually a 61
second minute on Dec. 31.  The trouble comes in keeping the "seconds
since the epoch" counter sane, meaning (seconds % 86400) == 0 at
00:00:00 UTC.  Since there were 86401 seconds Dec. 31, the kernel had to
tick the last second twice to keep correct UTC time.
NTP is used to distribute and synchronize time information, including
leap second info.
See Wikipedia and Google for more information.
