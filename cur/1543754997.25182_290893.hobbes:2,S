Mark it as dead and release structures when holder lets it go. With hotplug
pretty much everywhere more and more systems can handle it. Plus one could
argue that if an object needs a special driver to function properly it will
unlikely be busy before native driver is loaded.
Also, one still can do what Adam offers by pre-loading native drivers in
cases whent is required but still support more flexible default scheme.
