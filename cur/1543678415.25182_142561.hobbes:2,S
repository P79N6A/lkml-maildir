(I'm taking the liberty to update the subject, which I accidentally left
blank)
Because 2.4 has that behavior. One objection that people raised to
applying the 2.4 ACPI patch was that it changed that behavior. So I made
an effort to keep it there.
I think out of sheer inertia I also re-added it to the 2.5 tree.
Probably shouldn't have.
Does anyone have a reason why acpismp=force should be in 2.5/6? If not
I'll go ahead and zap it (again), and everyone should just be aware that
this is another way that 2.4 and 2.5 differ.
