No, /dev/random would always keep a conservative estimate of entropy.
Assuming that network entropy > 0, this would add more real (but
unaccounted) entropy to the pool, and if you agree with this assumption,
you would be able to take advantage of it by reading /dev/urandom.
The only case where it would make things worse is if you're getting so
many entropy events batched that the queue fills up and high entropy
events get discarded in favor of earlier low entropy ones.
