(i'm betting that the mail server i use back in canada is going to tag
this yet again with "{Spam?}" since i'm in california at the moment
and i'll just bet it's freaking out seeing stuff coming from a totally
unknown IP address.  i've already sent an email to the admins about
this.  sorry.)

in fact, according to this:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/1/13/139
that notice was put in the feature removal file well over a year ago,
during 2.6.15.  so that would seem to be more than adequate time for
everyone to prepare for it.  but it must have been deleted from that
file since then as well.
i probably should have mentioned that in my initial posting.
