Hi Sam,
I think we should use "Save As..." idea. And thereby menuconfig,
qconfig, gconfig will be affected. Please give me time to make patches.
(I'm a little busy now so I hope to make them during a week :)
The patch I sent to Vladimir does not normalize behaviour of config
process but just makes an alternate file as a snapshot of current config
state. You may review it as a temporary solution only.
