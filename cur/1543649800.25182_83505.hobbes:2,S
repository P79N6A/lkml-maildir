Thinking about it a bit more, my idea to use -1 is indeed unnecessary,
since userspace code can check if the adapter node changes to 0 before
it itself writes a 0 to it.  If multiple users/software play around with
the nodes at the same time, they'll get what's coming to them...

Yeah, as Steven mentions in his reply, Linux drivers don't handle this
well at the moment.
