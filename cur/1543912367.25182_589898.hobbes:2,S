The tragic bit is that we were sold similar DOMs in 2007...
(It's probably time to change suppliers?)

OK. (Grumble)

Double word is 32 bits, right? Isn't "Cannot perform double-word IO" in 
contradiction with the following statements?
  IO_support    =  1 (32-bit)
         Buffer size: 1.0kB      bytes avail on r/w long: 4
(Assuming an 8-bit byte, 4 bytes = 32 bits)

When you say "the current libata IDE" do you mean PATA_VIA (in my case)?
I've avoided this driver because it is marked EXPERIMENTAL. Would there 
be any benefit in using it over the legacy ATA/MFM/RLL driver?

What do the warnings mean? :-)
