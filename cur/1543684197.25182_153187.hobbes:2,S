In looking at the kernel source, I don't see support for this device.  I
do see support for others like it, but with different product ids.
Perhaps Grant can play with the settings in
drivers/usb/storage/unusual_devs.h to try to tweak things to work for
his device.
Sorry for not stating this originally, it has been a long day :)
