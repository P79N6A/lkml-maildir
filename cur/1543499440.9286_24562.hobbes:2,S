Subject: version of drivers/sound/audio.c in 2.0.3[67]

I think there is a mixup in audio.c (or there was a patch rollback that I
missed).
I have a little kernel patch/module called paudio that allows capturing
of whatever data is being sent to the sound card.  I was updating for
2.0.3[67] when I came across something odd.
The linux 2.0.36 tree that I have (and as far as I remember came with
RH5.2) has an audio.c that has this for the first 40 or so lines (call
this "audio-unknown"):
/*
 * sound/audio.c
 *
 * Device file manager for /dev/audio
 */

 */
/*
 * Thomas Sailer   : ioctl code reworked (vmalloc/vfree removed)
 * Thomas Sailer   : moved several static variables into struct audio_operations 
 *                   (which is grossly misnamed btw.) because they have  the same 
 *                   lifetime as the rest in there and dynamic allocation saves
 *                   12k or so
 */
I am running with this version of audio.c, and the kernel reports being
2.0.36.
A version I just pulled off of www.us.kernel.org has this (call
it "audio-2.0.36"):
/*
 * sound/audio.c
 *
 * Device file manager for /dev/audio
 */
/*
 * Copyright (C) by Hannu Savolainen 1993-1996

As you can see, the copyrights are different.  In fact, much of the code
is different.  I checked a audio.c in 2.0.37 (call it "audio-2.0.37") and
it is identical to "audio-2.0.36", so I guess it is the correct one (dang,
now I have to rework and retest my patch).
My question is where did "audio-unknown" come from?  "audio-unknown"
claims to be part of OSS/Free, whereas the others claim to be part of
USS/Lite.  AFAIK, OSS/Free was more current.  I run Red Hat 5.2 which I
_vaguely_ (and perhaps erroneously) recall shipped with a non-final
version of 2.0.36, so that might explain this, especially if some changes 
were backed out before 2.0.36-final shipped.
