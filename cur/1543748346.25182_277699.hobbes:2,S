We would need to schedule a special tick like event at a certain time but
otherwise I do not see a problem. Is there a requirement that these
"specific amounts of time" are less than 1 ms? The timer hardware (such as
the RTC clock) can generate an event in <200ns that could be used to
change the scaling. For a tickless system we would need to have such
scheduled events anyways.

That looks troublesome. Better avoid that.

I am still suffering from my limited NTP knowlege but will see what I can
do about this.
