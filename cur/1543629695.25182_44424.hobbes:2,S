Hi,
I don't know whether I have a hardware problem or a kernel problem.  Here's
what I get when I try to dummy burn a data CDR on 2.4.19pre8:
Track 01: data  586 MB
Total size:     674 MB (66:46.85) = 300514 sectors
Lout start:     674 MB (66:48/64) = 300514 sectors
Current Secsize: 2048
ATIP info from disk:
  Indicated writing power: 4
  Is not unrestricted
  Is not erasable
  ATIP start of lead in:  233100 (151:50/00)
  ATIP start of lead out: 523425 (116:21/00)
Disk type:    unknown
Manuf. index: -1
Manufacturer: unknown (not in table)
Blocks total: 333975 Blocks current: 333975 Blocks remaining: 33461
Starting to write CD/DVD at speed 1 in dummy mode for single session.
Last chance to quit, starting dummy write in 0 seconds. Operation starts.
Waiting for reader process to fill input buffer ... input buffer ready.

Trouble flushing the cache
Writing  time:   69.828s
Fixating...
WARNING: Some drives don't like fixation in dummy mode.
Fixating time:    0.008s
cdrecord: fifo had 221 puts and 158 gets.
cdrecord: fifo was 0 times empty and 141 times full, min fill was 90%.
This was at speed=1 my writer is supposed to handle up to speed=4.  When I
retry I get errors after various amounts have been written.  The command
I issued was "cdrecord -v dev=0,0,0 -dummy -data speed=1 /home/xxxxx/backup.img"
Do I have a bad writer or is this a kernel bug?  I'll gladly provide any 
additional config or hardware info as requested.
