suspend/wakeup is a device issue, solved well by devicefs.  This is
completely independent from the subtleties of initialization order in
the core kernel code: devices are not the problem.
Look at how many places have explicit initializers with #ifdef
CONFIG_XXX around them, because initialization order problems were too
hard before.  These can now be fixed as desired.
I really want *one* place where you can see what order things are
initalized.  If that means one big file with #ifdef's, fine.  But the
current approach of using link order, initializer levels and explicit
initializers is really hard to debug and modify.
Rusty.
