Just to add another argument to disallowing suspend
instead of qualifying wakeup:
In 99% of cases, with no OC, this won't come into play.
In .9% of cases, with transient OC, this won't delay suspend long.
In .01% of cases, with all hardwired OC ports, suspend does not matter.
Plus it cures the above problems #1 and #2.
If problem #1 occurs, I don't see that thrashing is
any better than not suspending at all.
