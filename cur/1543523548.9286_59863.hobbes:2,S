There seem to be some problems with programs holding the
mmap_sem semaphore. People are working on it.

The VM changes have _exposed_ problems. It turned out that
a lot of places in the kernel call __get_free_pages() with
GFP_WAIT set, even though they get into trouble if they
have to wait...
I've programmed something to catch the bad code and work
around it. I've been trying to break the kernel with this
code for a few hours now (_heavy_ stresstesting) and
things seem to be ok.
When it survives the last few tests I'll post the patch
and put it online at 
http://www.surriel.org/patches/.
regards,
Rik
