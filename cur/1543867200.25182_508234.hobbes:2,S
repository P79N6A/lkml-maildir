Yes, it could be better, although it is not necessary for now (link
order is telling who should get called first).

Yes, link order matters; however, the problem is related to
cfag12864b_init() being called if ks0108 failed. Indeed, if cfag12864b
is called before ks0108 is a mistake too, but it isn't happening here.
I also think the solution looks hacky (I said that I was waiting for a
better solution), and also I think it should be checked by the kernel
at boot like modprobe does; but I don't know any other solution. Any
ideas?
