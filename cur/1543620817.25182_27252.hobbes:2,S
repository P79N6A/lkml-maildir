Hi Ben,
I have one more question on your latest aio patch.
raw_kvec_rw() seem to handle max upto 512K (max_sectors = 2500). 
But I don't see any where you loop thro to satisfy the entire 
IO request.
Infact, generic_aio_read() is mapping the user buffer for the iosize 
and calling file->f_op->kvec_read(file, cb, iosize, pos). 
How does the io > 512K gets handled ?
NOTE: I have not looked at the userlevel code. Is IO split at max 512K
      at userlevel ?
Thanks,
Badari
