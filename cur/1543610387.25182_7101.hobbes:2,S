I take it you did a normal ./configure; make; make install?  I am running
1.25 without any problems.

e2fsck wouldn't log anything in dmesg or in syslog.  It would be helpful
to see what the exact messages are.  Note also, that e2fsck 1.10 is
_very_ old (released 4.5 years ago), so it is entirely possible that
your fs has problems in it that it could not detect, but the newer e2fsck
does find.
I would suggest booting from a recovery disk with a statically linked
e2fsck 1.25, and then run it under "script" so you get a log of all
the output.  Post it here.
Cheers, Andreas
