Hi!
I have some problems with connecting 4 NICs to an HP-Switch (ProCurve 8000)
and do some loadbalancing via teql (kernel 2.2.5-ac6). Problem is, that 
some services run (i.e. ftp, dns, rsh node ls...) but some other (rlogin, 
telnet) do not. Some hosts are visable from the master (with teql) and some
other do not... 
Someone with a hint???
Bye, Nils
