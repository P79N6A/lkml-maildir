The tag is purely so we can tell free stuff apart. If you tag a module
MODULE_LICENSE("(c) Copyright EvilCorp, All rights wronged");
it will still load but the user will be advised not to report bugs to the
kernel lists and the like. The oops data will similarly be marked "tainted"
so that we can discard it.
It's a filter so we don't have to handle bugs in your driver, nothing more.
