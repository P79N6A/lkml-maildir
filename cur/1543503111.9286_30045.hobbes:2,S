Ooops. Take out everything except fs/proc/* stuff - the rest is heavily
wrong.
BTW, folks - something seriously weird happens: in schedule() we have a
	get_mmu_context(...);
	switch_to(...);
	put_mmu_context(...);
Fine. Looks like the last line is *never* executed. OK, I said <censored>
and inserted printk("foo"); before the switch_to() and panic("bar");
immediately after. No way in hell - it executes the printk(). On all
switches. Yep, plural - panic() is never called. WTF??? OK, we are
switching to another process, but bloody hell, we are going into the same
blasted place in the schedule(). Or at least we are supposed to... What
the ?
