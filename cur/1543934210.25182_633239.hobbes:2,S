Yes, we do.  It's exactly this side effect which makes this safer than 
either 0x80 or 0xED -- it's a port that *guaranteed* can't be reclaimed 
for other purposes without breaking MS-DOS compatibility.
It's specifically a side effect *we don't care about*, except in the 
by-now-somewhat-exotic case of 386+387 (where we indeed can't use it 
once user code has touched the FPU -- but we can fall back to 0x80 on 
those, a very small number of systems.)  486+ doesn't use this interface 
under Linux, since Linux uses the proper exception path on those 
processors.  If Compaq had wired up the proper signals on the first 386 
PC motherboards, we wouldn't have cared about it on the 386 either.
