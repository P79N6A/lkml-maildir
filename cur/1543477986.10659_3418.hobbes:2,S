Problem #1 - you just moved the race to enable_bh.
(You also might not want to use "load" so confusingly.)
Problem #2 - You need to lock down the code and data used by the
function call while the call is in progress.  It would be just peachy
if, after the disable_bh call, the module memory got freed while a
bottom half was running in it.
Since this is not a heavily contended lock, it makes sense to lock
around all bottom-half processing rather than each handler separately.
That's why I was assuming that the locking I saw there was doing the
right thing.
