Hi!
Slowing down the development for 2.4, eh? ;-) Anyway, I like this
"last minute addition". :-) In fact I used devfs several times and
even contributed a little to it. To correct my e-mail address,
here is a patch:

 Changes for patch v105
 
 - Unregister SCSI host from <scsi_host_no_list> in <scsi_unregister>
-  Thanks to Zoltan BOSZORMENYI <zboszor@mol.hu>
+  Thanks to Zoltán Böszörményi <zboszor@mail.externet.hu>
 
 - Don't save /dev/log in rc.devfs
 
**************************************
I have some problems with it now. I couldn't log in as root. Again. :-)
However, adding [1-8] to /etc/securetty helped. /dev/tty[1-8] are symlinks
to /dev/vc/[1-8]... Just in case someone else has fallen into this trap.
Now the real problems. The provided modules.conf sample does not work,
I mean it does not load all SCSI drivers correctly for me. Try this patch
against the provided modules.conf for e.g. SCSI disks.

**************************************
This way it works for me with and without devfs. E.g. "mdir z:"
(Z: refers to /dev/sda4) nicely loads sym53c8xx and ppa drivers
in this order. Maybe it is the fault of modutils-2.3.9 but using
simply "probeall scsi-hosts sym53c8xx ppa" didn't work.
Which is a shame because this "probeall" thing would be a shorter
and nicer way to describe what I want to load and in what order.
Another problem is that when I try to rmmod all SCSI drivers
_second time_ scsi_mod gets stuck (uninitialized). At the first time
all modules can be removed. But this is not devfs' fault, it happens
with other late 2.3.x as well.
And a note at the end. I start devfsd on boot and I had to put a
"sleep 2" after starting it because the boot sequence stops at
"Mounting local filesystems" twice from five. It is with devfsd-1.3.1.
I looked at devfsd.c and before it forks, it generates the register
events for the already existing device nodes but the events are
handled by the child process. This first round of events should be
handled by the parent process so the startup scripts will not
need this (unreliable amount of) delay. Maybe do_scan_and_service()
should send a "finished startup" event after the last device node
and before the fork() main() should service the events until this
"finished startup"...

Zoltan Boszormenyi
