Seems all right in regards to the issues with 7.4.
I do though get that xmms sort of 'hangs'.  Its not hard, it just say in
the 'play' state, but the graph do not move, and no sound.  This is
fairly intermittently.  Not sure though if it is scheduler only,
something recent in -bk, or the recent alsa patch Takashi Iwai
posted (using dmix btw).   I will have a look and let you know.
Cheers,
