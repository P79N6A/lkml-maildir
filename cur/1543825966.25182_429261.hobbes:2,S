Now it is you who are ignoring what I've been saying. I've been saying
that I don't think your sys_readahead examples have had much to do with
plugging:
1. If there are no other requests to seek to, plugging doesn't matter;
2. If there are other requests to seek to, the queue won't be plugged
    or will soon become unplugged anyway. So the current system isn't
    somehow going to do the right thing every time and be immune to
    seeking.

I'm not, but the current system of plugging isn't ideal. Anyway, there
isn't any point going on about it, if I want to change anything I at
least need to come back with numbers.
