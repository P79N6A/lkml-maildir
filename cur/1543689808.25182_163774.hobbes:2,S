Its actually more important when you have smaller timeslices, because
the interactive task is more likely to use all of its timeslice in a
burst of activity, then getting stuck behind all the cpu hogs.

Yes. Also, say 5 hogs running, an interactive task needs to do something
taking 2ms. At a 2ms timeslice, it will take 2ms. At a 1ms timeslice it
will take 6ms.
