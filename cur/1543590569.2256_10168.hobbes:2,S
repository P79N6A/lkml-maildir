Heaven help us when tradition is more important than clarity.
Typewriter has always been wrong. I'd agree that "Not a teletypewriter" would 
suffice.
On the other hand "Inappropriate ioctl for device" is also not very clear.
I'd like to see "Not a serial or character device" or "Not a serial device" if 
that's more appropriate. Something like that...
