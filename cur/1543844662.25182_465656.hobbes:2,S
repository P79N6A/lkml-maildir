We already have that scheme. Any existing driver should be already converted
away from GFP_DMA towards dma_*/pci_*. dma_* knows all the magic
how to get memory for the various ranges. No need to mess up the 
main allocator.
Anyways, i suppose what could be added as a fallback would be a 
really_slow_brute_force_try_to_get_something_in_this_range() allocator
that basically goes through the buddy lists freeing in >O(1) 
and does some directed reclaim, but that would likely be a separate
path anyways and not need your new structure to impact the O(1)
allocator.
I am still unconvinced of the real need. The only gaping hole was 
GFP_DMA32, which we fixed already.
Ok there is aacraid with its weird 2GB limit, but in case there are
really enough users running into this broken then then the really_slow_*
thing above would be likely fine. And those cards are slowly going
away too.  
If we managed to resist for too long now is the wrong time.

Think of it this way: all the weird slow devices of 5-10 years ago have USB
interfaces today and that does 32bit just fine (=GFP_DMA32). And old 5-10 years old weird
devices are usually fine with 16MB of playground only.
Ok now I'm sure someone will come up with a counter example (hi Alan), but:
- Does the device really need more than 16MB?
- How often is it used on systems with >1/2GB with a 64bit kernel?
[consider that 64bit kernels don't support ISA]
- How many users of that particular thing around?
I think my point stands.
