I just checked out on current Linus BK with my AGP Radeon 9000 which
is pretty close to a 9200. Everything is working fine.
I notice from his logs that he is running a PCI radeon, not an AGP
one. Didn't someone make some changes to the PCI radeon memory
management code recently? I run a PCI R128 and that is still working.
DRM debug output might give more clues.
