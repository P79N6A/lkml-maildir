Implementing it is a big problem, since gethostbyname usualy means a DNS
lookup. Best way to do it in kernel is
call_usermode_helper('/sbin/khost') and call gethostbyname in there.

However as long as you are resolving IP address, you should not ask for
gethostbyname. You should ask for inet_aton, which does exist (the name
was mentioned in some list (linux-kernel or this one) not long ago, but
I do not remember it).
