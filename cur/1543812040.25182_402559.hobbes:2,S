The nameidata _IS_ the vfs structure for storing path context
information. You seem to be suggesting we need yet another one. Why?

Vetoed!
Redundant RPC calls have performance costs to the client, the server and
the network. That intent information is there in order to allow the
filesystem to figure out whether or not it needs to do the permissions
check, or if that check is already being done by other operations.
Removing the intents are therefore not an option.
