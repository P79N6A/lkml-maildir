Well, having worked for an ISP and currently working for Make Systems
(we make network modeling software), there is a place for this, BUT IT
SHOULD NEVER BE DONE WITHOUT EXPLICIT OPERATOR ACTION.  Translation: If
I didn't run a specifically designed network discovery tool, then this
should not happen.  A fucking printer driver shouldn't even know what
SNMP is.

And likewise, the DNS server the application is looking for may not be on
the same network.

Didn't it already use DHCP to get an IP address?  How many DHCP servers don't
send back DNS server data as well?  At any rate, people should stop trying
to make their installers such smart-asses.  Ask the damned operator before
you "drop back and punt."  Odds are, the person installing things knows the
DNS server addresses.  And if they don't, the installer can give them the
_option_ of sending megabytes of junk to hundreds of machines in the off-
chance they'll handle DNS for you.
If you ever have to scan a range of addresses, it's probablly in your best
interest to ask the monkey with the keyboard for some input/guidance.

PS: I'm all to well aware of the ever dwindling average intellegence on linux
    users, but I still advocate asking a stupid user before doing something
    even stupider.
PPS: Even windows will ask for DNS settings in the absence of DHCP.  No DNS
     in the DHCP data == NO DNS unless you specify the settings.
