Subject: [PATCH]: Fix overloaded use of apic= on bootline
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Andrew, I've submitted this a couple of times and it's had a review by Randy.
Any chance we can get this in?
Thanks,
P.
The use of "apic=" on the boot line is overloaded.  It is used once to
override the type of genapic, and then later on it is used to determine a debug
level.  Because of this a bogus error message is sent to the console when using
the debug option:
	Unknown genapic `apic=debug' specified.
	This patch changes the genapic situation to use "genapic=".
