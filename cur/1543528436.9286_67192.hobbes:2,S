Yes.  It will fail to mount a journal-less partition (unless you have
created a new journal file and have asked for it to be initialised).
For the root filesystem, the kernel will then automatically try ext2
instead.

No.  I've no idea where you got that idea from!  12k isn't a special
size at all to journaling.
The journal will  work more efficiently if it is contiguous, but you can
make it any size you want, anywhere on the disk.  It should be at least
1024 blocks long.
