As far as I am concerned, we still *are* waiting for a "GNU OS", or rather
*THE* "GNU OS" that Richard Stallman keeps talking about as having been
almost complete in 1992, but even in 2003, is not ready to be rolled out.
This very truth - the fact that Richard Stallman's people have taken
more than 10 years, and they still are not done, suggests that the
existence of an OS such as Linux is not an 'accident' related to
certain skillsets colliding at a random interval, such as the original
poster wishes to suggest.
*Microsoft*... now *that* is a 'certain skillsets colliding at random
interval' scenario... :-)
Oops... I think I just extended this thread. Damn.
