Subject: vfat unlink latency 54.6ms for 128MB files

Just wondering, when I remove a 128MB file on vfat partition
(usb-storage, memcard reader), it causes 54.6ms latency
in rtc_latencytest...  latency seems to increase linearly
as the filesize grows.  I calculated 1s would be reached with
2344MB file but I didn't bother trying that yet.
Are there any possible fixes for fat fs so
that it doesn't disable interrupts for that long a time?
When I use loop device (the file on reiserfs), I get 45.9ms latency,
so this is not usb's fault. 
These with Linux-2.6.10-ac8 on UP, PPro+, no preempt.
