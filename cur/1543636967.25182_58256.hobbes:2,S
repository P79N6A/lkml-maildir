Thankyou all for explaining the system call internals to me. Feel like an 
idiot now :) 
Marco Colombo: As for what I am trying to achieve, it is simply this. I need 
to do plot extraction from radar raw returns. The scan time for one 
revolution is 2.44 secs. I need to extract plots for each pi/2 radians in 
less than 2.44/4 secs. I have already optimized the extraction algo upto 
SSE2 in assembly and am running the process as realtime, but it just cant 
seem to cut it. So now I am going to try and block interrupts while I do the 
DSP. 
Regards,
Irfan Hamid.
