Thats not an excuse. If the futex stuff allows arbitary memory locking
and it isnt properly accounted then its a bug, with the added problem
that its easier to have nasty accidents with than pipes.
We have a per user object nowdays so accounting per user locked memory
looks rather doable both for mlock, pipe, af_unix socket and for other
things
