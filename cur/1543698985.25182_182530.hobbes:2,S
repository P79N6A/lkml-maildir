(FWIW) I have a server running 2.4.22 and pppoe (to talk to an ADSL
modem). It works really flawlessly *except* when I run mldonkey: then
pppoe regularly fails and drops the connection. As this thing generates
a lot of packets to/from different hosts, I suspects it's an excellent
test workload for some paths of the kernel.
