NACK, the admin (and with the new inherited capabilities all users with 
cap_???_override) can see all processes. Only users who don't need to know
won't see the other user's processes.

su1 and sudo exist.

Privacy is important, too. Imagine each user can see the CEO (or the
admin) executing "ee nakedgirl.jpg".

I used unpatched procps 3.1.11, and it worked for me, except pstree.

e.g. the buffer overflow in sendmail? Or all the open relays? :)
The demands to security and privacy have increased. Linux should be able 
to provide the requested privacy.

Works as intended. Only pstree breaks, if init isn't visible.

I'd prefer a minimum and a maximum mask. If the admin wants to enforce 
privacy, he can do it, and if he wants the users to spy on each other, so 
be it.
