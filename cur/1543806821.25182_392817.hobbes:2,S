Adding the binary only nvidia module is not a little thing.
That driver is a closed source binary blob that noone here has a
chance to debug.
You can switch to the 'nv' driver and see if you still have the
problem. The nv driver won't give you accelerated 3D, but for 2D it
should work just fine.

Please try to reproduce without the nvidia driver ever being loaded -
just unloading it is *not* good enough, it needs to have never been
loaded at all.
As long as that (or any other binary-only module for that matter) has
been loaded into the kernel for just a second it's impossible to say
if that module or some other part of the kernel is the cause of the
problem.
