Sure, let's try to get this done.

This is a bit ugly, and I don't think it actually works.
If, at some time in the future you change the suspend state to a struct
then you will want to pass that thing around by reference, not by value. 
Hence your new suspend_state_t will need to be typecast to a pointer to
struct, and not a struct.  And that's not a thing which we do in-kernel
much at all.  (There's nothing wrong with the practice per-se, but in the
kernel it does violate the principle of least surprise).
So if you really do intend to add more things to the suspend state I'd
suggest that you set the final framework in place immediately.  Do:
struct suspend_state {
	enum system_state state;
}
static inline enum pci_state to_pci_state(struct suspend_state *state)
{
	if (state->state == PM_SUSPEND_ON)
		return PCI_D0;
	if (state->state == PM_SUSPEND_STANDBY)
		return PCI_D1;
	...
}
