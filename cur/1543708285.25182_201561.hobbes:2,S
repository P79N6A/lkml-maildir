As the variable type is only used after the bridge code, I think it is best to 
postpone the initialization of type until after the bridge code. This is of 
course of no concern to the standard 2.4 kernel (as ebtables isn't in 2.4). 
This problem exists in the 2.6 kernel, however.
I'll make a fix for 2.6 later, unless someone beats me to it. I'm kind of busy 
at the moment.
cheers,
Bart
