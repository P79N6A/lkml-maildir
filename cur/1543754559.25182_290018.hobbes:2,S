Just forget to swapon again after the recent fillmem cleanup, I do have
1G of swap usually on as well!

No paging, it basically never hits swap. Buffered io by itself seems to

explain really, but there's a noticable difference to the feel of usage
when it has just been force-pruned with fillmem and before.
