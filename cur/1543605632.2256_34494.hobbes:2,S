The HiSax driver should be fine - I use it 100% of the time (or at least
100% of the time we have power to the house) on my SMP box at home, without 
trouble. I see no reason why the other drivers would have problems.
If you're having problem with modules loading, there's probably a
compilation problem. If you're using a distro kernel, check it's installed
properly. If you're building your own, rebuild it and the modules.
