Confirmed.
All my webservers (the ones that generate this message) are identical
and this is the filesystems they have and their mount options:
/ is on a local scsi disk, ext3 fs, mounted with (rw)
/boot is on a local scsi disk, ext3 fs, mounted with (rw)
users homedirs (where the DocumentRoots are) are NFS mounted with
mount options (rw,rsize=8192,wsize=8192,hard,intr,addr=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx)
