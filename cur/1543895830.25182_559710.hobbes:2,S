There's more than one way to do it.
One is...
	tcpdump -lni eth0 tcp [extra operands to match SYN packets] |
	myprogram
a longer one is to write your own netfilter userspace program
that receives the TCP SYNs (by means of -j NFQUEUE) and does
take action.
Another one is to use -j LOG and let your program parse
down /var/log/firewall. Like
	iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 25 --syn -j LOG --log-prefix "[evil]"
	tail -f /var/log/firewall | grep '^\[evil\]' | myscript
myscript:
#!/usr/bin/perl
while (defined(my $line = <>)) {
	my($ip) = ($line =~ /SRC=(\S+)/);
	# Do something
}

The scripts runs constantly, preferably.
