Some details are worth to be mentioned :
- The 5-NOP variant will imply a replacement of 5 1 bytes instructions with 1 5
  bytes one, which is trickier. Masami Hiramatsu's proposal of 2 bytes near jump
  + 3 NOPS is nicer.
- Patching such a 5-bytes instruction memory region doesn't turn markers into a
  complete function call, which includes argument passing.
- The argument "most of the users wont use a particular feature" contradicts
  what you said earlier about every distribution wanting to enable a tracing
  mechanism for their users.

I think that the performance benefits gained by using tracing information for
studying a system makes the overhead of a jump in the kernel fast path
insignificant. Having a stack setup + function call already put there by the
compiler has the following advantages :
- It is very robust (I could think of using it on a live server, which is not
  true of the djprobe approach).
- It is predictable on every architecture.
- The information extracted is _always_ coherent with the marked variables,
  because the compiler itself created the full function call (stack setup
  included).

2 bytes jump + 3 bytes nops.. Yes, it should modify it without causing an
illegal instruction, but how ? Are you aware that their approach has to :
- put an int3
- wait for _all_ the CPUs to execute this int3
- then change the 5 bytes instruction
I can think of a lot of cases where the CPUs will never execute this int3.
Probably that sending an IPI or launching a kernel thread on each CPU to make
sure that this int3 is executed could give more guarantees there. But my point
is not even there : I have seen very skillful teams work hard on those
hardware-caused problems for years and the result is still not usable. It looks
to me like a race between software developers and hardware manufacturers, where
the software guy is always one step behind. This kind of scenario happens when
you want to use an architecture in a way it was not designed and tested for.
As long as CPU manufacturers won't design for live instruction patching (and why
should they do that ? the in3 breakpoint is all what is needed from their
perspective), this will be a race where software developers will lose.

Interesting idea. That would make it possible to probe local variables at the
marker site. That's very good for use of kprobes on low rate debug-type markers,
but that doesn't solve my concern about the cat-and-mouse race expressed earlier
about live kernel polymorphic code.
I would be all in for this kind of combo :
If you can find a way to make a kprobe-based probe extract the variables from
such a variable-dependency marked site, that would be great for dynamic of low
event rate code paths. For the high event rate, and while we wait for such a
probe to exist, I think that the load+jump over a complete call is the lowest
cost, most robust, coherent, predictable and portable mechanism I have seen
so far.
