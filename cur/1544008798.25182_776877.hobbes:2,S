It sets the TIF_NOERROR thread flag, which is tested in the syscall
exit path along with various other thread flags.
force_successful_syscall_return() is defined for powerpc in
arch/powerpc/include/asm/ptrace.h.  It's nothing new, it has existed
for ages and is used in a few other places already.  It has existing
non-null definitions on alpha, ia64, powerpc, and sparc64.
Paul.
