hm, weird. Next idea: could you activate trace_freerunning and change
the alsa_driver.c count hack to do:
	if (!count) {
		gettimeofday(0,1);
		count = 1;
	}
this means that tracing will only be activated once, and the tracing
goes on non-stop from that point on, up until the first xrun, at which
point the full tracebuffer is saved. Ok?
