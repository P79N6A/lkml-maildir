Yep I meant driverfs. Oops.

It's a matter of where to draw the line. Obviously when we're talking
physical devices, my tcpip connection to www.yahoo.com is not one. My PS/2
port is. I actually think keeping in mind that driverfs is for power
management can help delineate what should be in driverfs and what shouldn't.
With technologies like USB, infiniband, NFS, iSCSI, and 1394, it's tough,
but the main question should be:
"If my computer suspends, should this device be turned off?" Which is
another way of asking is the use of a device exclusive to a particular
machine.
If a device can be accessed by multiple machines concurrently, it should not
be in driverfs.

"Just" power management??? Like power management isn't important enough???
;-)
We need a device tree to do PM. If driverfs's PM capabilities are hurt
because it doesn't stay true to that, then the featureitis has gone too far.
