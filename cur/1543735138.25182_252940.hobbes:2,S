Actually, I find myself agreeing with Albert here.  Consider the
following points:
- "current_thread()" depends on the kernel stack pointer.
- the kernel stack pointer is changed when we switch threads.
- the rest of the register set is changed when we switch threads.
Therefore, if we have current_thread() cached in a register, and we
away from thread A to thread B, and back to A, has the cached copy
become invalid for thread A ?  No.
Now look at the same thing from thread B's perspective.  Has anything
changed because thread A has run?  No.
IOW, think from a tasks point of view.  It gets into the scheduler,
and switch_to() is just a normal function which just happens to sleep
for some time.
