Yes, faster.  From a whole-system point of view, which is after
all what we care about.
Cache misses are terribly expensive.

Sure.  Large cache footprints in the kernel require more cache
reloads by the kernel and cause more cache reloads on return
to userspace.  Thrashing.

OK.  Please integrate you patch into the current kernel's usercopy.c.

Well it won't hurt, but it looks like yours improves on it.
The thing which requires some thought is "should the decision
be made at compile time or runtime".  For Athlon vs Intel
and i386 vs others, it should be performed at compile time.
