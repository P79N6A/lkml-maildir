Okay. I tried the same test with 2.4.22 and it fails for the same
reason as described below.
I seem to have a problem where my TCP connection aborts
when both the client and the server are, perfectly fine, up and running and sending 
data to each other. I have enabled keepalive on both the client and server side.
I was able to reproduce this problem by doing the following.
I  setup the tcp parameters to be as follows :
              tcp_keepalive_time =  2
              tcp_keepalive_probes = 1
              tcp_keepalive_intvl = 3
My server and client send data to each other approximately every 2 seconds.
From tcpdump output I figured out the following.  After a keepalive_probe is sent out (at the expiry of  keepalive_time)
if it is immediately followed by some valid data, then the ack for the keepalive_probe from the remote side does 
not seem to reset the probes_out to 0. Because of  this when the keepalive_timer expires 
the next time it RSTs the connection.
The following code in tcp_input.c, seems to be the problem
	if ((prior_packets = tp->packets_out) == 0)
		goto no_queue;
	// Vijay's COMMENT - probes_out not being reset in this scenario.
            ....
	          return 1;
            no_queue:
                      tp->probes_out = 0
            ....
Since in my case prior_packets is not 0, because of the valid data, probes_out is not being reset. Is it okay to set       "tp->probes_out = 0" before the "return 1" line above ?
In tcp_timer.c, the following code seems to reset the connection on the next keepalive
timer expiry,
    if (!tp->keepalive_probes && tp->probes_out >= sysctl_tcp_keepalive_probes) ||
         ...)
    {
	tcp_SEnd_Active_reset (sk, GFP_ATOMIC);
	tcp_write_err(sk);
	goto out;
    }
Can somebody let me know  if  I am missing something here or is it a genuine problem that 
has been fixed in a later release.
I can provide the tcpdump if need be.
Thanks,
Vijay

There have been hundreds of fixes to the TCP code since 2.4.7, so it's
basically a waste of time for anyone to try and analyze your report
until you try and reproduce it with current generation 2.4.x kernels.
2.4.22 would be fine.
This applies to all of the reports you posted today.
