I agree.  I also think that modules that support hot plug devices should
export an ioctl, callback routine, or such so that we can let the driver
know when it's about to have a card yanked.  Without changing the driver
interface we don't gain much since we have to unload and reload the
driver (not a pretty thing).
The IRIX driver model would be nice for this-- the driver loads without
attaching any devices.  The kernel then invokes the driver's attach()
routine for each device that the driver wants to claim.  If devices
are added, attach() is called at that time; if devices are removed,
detach() is called then.  The mechanism also supports partial unloading
of unused modules (usually after 5 min) if the device has not been
accessed recently.

The stub driver, yes.  Then invoke attach() when the device is actually
accessed.

Exactly.

Go take a look at the IRIX device driver guide.  You have to register
to get to it, but it's free registration and there is a lot of other
cool stuff there anyway.  That is essentially what I'm proposing, though
I would like to add a parameter to attach() that includes the assigned
device's unit number (for the minor).  It has to be done centrally
or things will break if two devices are attach()'d simultaneously.
