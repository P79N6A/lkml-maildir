I apologize for probably posting the previous message without thinking
enough. Returning to this problem after posting, I realized that the
Free swap=0 condition does not mean that VM is exhausted, as I had
first assumed (although this seemed logical). Thus when I wrote VM
exhausted, it should be read top (cand /proc/swaps) report free
swap=0.
In fact, I realized after that even after Free Swap =0, there was some
memory available as I was even able to launch netscape, for example.
The extra memory required seemed to be obtained at the expense of the
"cached" figure, as expected. Even then the response was quite good
given the amount of memory swapped.
I was first shocked by the fact that cached pages seemed to be
swapped, but I guess it is faster to recover them from the swap than
from their original location.
I apologize again for wasting your valuable time. I have still many
things to learn.
Marc.

Changing overcommit_memory does not change behavior, and xanim does
not mmap the file. However, it does a lot of mmap/munmap such as:
mmap(0, 462848, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) = 0x40320000
munmap(0x401e6000, 462848)              = 0
mmap(0, 450560, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) = 0x401e6000
read(9, ")\315\206\335Rc\5\265eyX\244\6\320"..., 4096) = 4096
read(9, "\271w=\210M\367\223\324J=\331\222"..., 4096) = 4096
brk(0x80ef000)                          = 0x80ef000
