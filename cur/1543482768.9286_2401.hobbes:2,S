Hello everybody
While this can barely qualify as a showstopper bug, it still is a
nasty bug. :-(
It looks like BTTV is not properly initialized if machine is turned on
and booted into Linux. The card is Hauppauge WinTV PCI. If I boot
straight into Linux and launch a TV app (xawtv), I get only noise on
the screen. In order to make it work I have to boot into Windows,
launch a TV application there and only then to boot into Linux. 
I see this bug in both 2.2.0pre5 AND 2.2.0ac1. This bug is NOT present 
in 2.0.33 with a bttv driver (unfortunately I don't recall its version 
- I built it about half a year ago)
I compared a number of files in /proc when started "cold" and after
rebooting from Windows, yet I wasn't able to find any difference that
would point to a reason of such a bug.
Upon loading the bttv module, I get:
i2c: initialized
Linux video capture interface: v1.00
bttv0: Brooktree Bt848 (rev 18) bus: 0, devfn: 80, irq: 10, memory: 0xfb800000.
PCI: Enabling bus mastering for device 00:50
bttv: 1 Bt8xx card(s) found.

bttv0: model: BT848(Hauppauge old)
msp3400: init: chip=MSP3400C-C6
With 2.0.30 I get:
i2c: initialized
Linux video capture interface: v0.01 ALPHA
i2c: driver registered: msp3400
i2c: driver registered: tuner
bttv0: Brooktree Bt848 (rev 18) bus: 0, devfn: 80, irq: 10, memory: 0xfb800000.
bttv: 1 Bt848 card(s) found.
bttv0: model: HAUPPAUGE
i2c: bus registered: bt848-0
msp3400: init: chip=MSP3400C-C6
i2c: device attached: MSP3400C-C6 (addr=0x80, bus=bt848-0, driver=msp3400)
i2c: device attached: tuner (addr=0xc2, bus=bt848-0, driver=tuner)
bttv: PCI display adapter: Matrox Millennium.

I would be glad to help with finding and eradicating this bug
