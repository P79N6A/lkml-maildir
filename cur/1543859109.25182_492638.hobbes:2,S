Magic. And btw, _thanks_ for being such a great tester.
So now I have one more thng for you to try, it you can bother:
There's exactly two call sites that call "page_mkclean()" (an dthat is the 
only thing in turn that calls "page_mkclean_one()", which we already 
determined will cause the corruption). 
Both of them do 
	if (mapping_cap_account_dirty(mapping)) {
			..
things, although they do slightly different things inside that if in your 
patched kernel.
Can you just TOTALLY DISABLE that case for the test_clear_page_dirty() 
case? Just do an "#if 0 .. #endif" around that whole if-statement, leaving 
the _only_ thing that actually calls "page_mkclean()" to be the 
"clear_page_dirty_for_io()" call.
Do you still see corruption?
