Why some people gets so much spam ??, I'm getting like 20-50 at
most(usually less), and I post to slashdot, i'm suscribed to several
mailing lists. I have 3 mail accounts, all of the for years, more than
7.
I get about 1 or 2 spams on my inbox, and sa-learn has worked quite well
on my box.
I have never received a "random words" spam. 
It's kind of weird.
Do the pople that gets ~600 spamd daily get a lot of repeated messages
or they are all different ?
