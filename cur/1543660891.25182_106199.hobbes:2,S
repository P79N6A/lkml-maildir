Well, the per-client configurations are an exception at our office, and
the only things we customize are XFree86 (we use the
Xfree86Config.hostname capability), gpm and the kernel, which is
dealt out by DHCPD. We also have a special startup script that is run
for the named box if it exists (/etc/init.d/host-specific/`hostname`).
I'm sure this won't work for everybody, but it does work for us, a
smallish development team.

Only after using devfs in this context have I come to appreciate how
nice it is. And I had it in place after 10 minutes of reading and two of
recompiled kernels. Amazing.
Take care,
