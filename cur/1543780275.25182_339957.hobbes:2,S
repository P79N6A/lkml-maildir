I have never run Snoopy on Windows myself and I did not want to subject
you to it. Let's try my delay patch first. If that fails, I guess we
have to get instructions from someone who knows how to run Snoopy.
Maybe Windows issues some cache synchronization command when it
commits FAT. Then the packet trace should show it.
