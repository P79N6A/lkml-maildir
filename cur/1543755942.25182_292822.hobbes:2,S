Hi Andrew.
I would like to suggest that you include the changelog
entries for the bk trees you suck in.
The format generated by:
bk changes -L | shortlog --mode=terse
should do it.
But it needs to be run for all the bk trees.
It would fit in just below the summary:
 
> number of patches in -mm: 516
> number of changesets in external trees: 504
> number of patches in -mm only: 498
> total patches: 1002
