By default, the maximum depth is used. For desktop use, a depth of 2-4
is probably more appropriate until the io schedulers become a little
more intelligent wrt queueing.

It only appears if AHCI is enabled, because tagged command queueing is
only working/enabled on AHCI. The message is informational only, CFQ
tells you that it has detected queueing hardware (driver maintains a
depth of >= 4).

Nothing.
