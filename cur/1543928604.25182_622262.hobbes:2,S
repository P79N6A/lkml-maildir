No, use "git rebase --interactive" ;-)
I've tried stgit/guilt/quilt as well, but I could never quite get the
hang of it (adding the files _before_ editing is the difficult part.) On
the other hand, git rebase --interactive fit right into my workflow and
improved it massively.
But I guess it's all a matter of personal preference.
