Hi Jon,
same motherboard here, but with 2 XP1800+.
It couldn't boot until I either disabled IO/APIC or disable MPS1.4 support
in the bios setup. Finally, I disabled MPS1.4 and let IO/APIC enabled and
it works really well in SMP. (In fact, I couldn't really imagine how fast
this could be !)
Regards,
Willy
