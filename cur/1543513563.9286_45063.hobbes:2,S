Ho humm.. I would almost prefer the "struct page" because in theory you
might want to do it without mapping the page at all. But this is
definitely a case where most of the time it's only needed with virtual
caches, so at the same time a virtual address is not necessarily wrong
either.
So my preference would be a "struct page", but if you have a stronger
opinion you can override me with a little argumentation for show, ok?
