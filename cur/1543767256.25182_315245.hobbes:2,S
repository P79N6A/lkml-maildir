You confused "high up the food chain" with "being intelligent".  Nothing 
prevents your oldest cluster node from making complex decisions, or calling 
into play other services in order to make those decision.  It could, for 
example, invoke some server on some other node to make the actual decision.
The important thing is to always have an easy _starting point_ for making 
decisions.  I do not think that dlm-based algorithms are suitable in that 
regard, because of the unavoidable code complexity just to kick off the 
process.  And obviously, there already is some reliable starting point or 
cman would not work.  So let's just expose that and have a better cluster 
stack.

But note that it _can_ use the oldest cluster member as a recovery master, or 
to designate a recovery master.  It can, and should - there is no excuse for 
making this any more complex than it needs to be.

True.  My point is that the sweet spot for cluster synchronization is, in my 
experience, usually _not_ the dlm.

All agreed, except that voting and group messaging should be provided as 
separate services in the style of plugins, on which the base cluster 
infrastructure does not depend.
OK, once we have found a way to plug in voting and whiz-bang messaging, I 
think we have discovered the mythical "vcs", the virtual cluster switch.  It 
doesn't need to be in-kernel though.
