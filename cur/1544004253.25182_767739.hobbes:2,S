Hi,
First patch had an additional problem in case snprintf() wanted to
write a string longer than the buffer and returned a large value.
Most likely this would never ever hit, but we can handle it by only
setting the actual length when we _didn't_ try to overflow the
buffer.
Secondly, the snprintf() won't ever write more than the given
number of bytes given, so allocating + 1 bytes isn't ever going to
do anything useful.
Thirdly, we also need to check whether snprintf() returned
>= unique_len. The buffer was also too small if snprintf() returns
== unique_len. snprintf() will always ensure that the result is
properly null-terminated, except in the case where the buffer is
NULL or the buffer size is zero (can never happen here).
It is also a bit suspicious that this function's return value is
never checked, and that we don't free the first allocation if the
second one fails. But maybe it's ok, didn't really check.
I encourage careful review of this patch, as my first attempt was
invalid without me noticing or anybody else saying a thing (or was
that why it was never pushed to mainline?) :-(
(And the original code was obviously in error to begin with.)

PS: Feel free to move any/all of this text into commit message if
patch is deemed worthy of inclusion. I just wanted to make the new
info stand out.

The hexdump decodes to:
vegardno@thuin ~ $ ./a.out 7063693a303030303a30303a30322e3000a76c080800000000a76c080e000000
pci:0000:00:02.0<0><167>l<8><8><0><0><0><0><167>l<8><14><0><0><0>
...so drm_getunique() is trying to copy some uninitialized data to
userspace. The ECX register contains the number of words that are
left to copy -- so there are 5 * 4 = 20 bytes left. The offset of the
first uninitialized byte (counting from the start of the string) is
also 20 (i.e. 0xf65d2294&((1 << 5)-1) == 20). So somebody tried to
copy 40 bytes when the string was only 19 long.
In drm_set_busid() we have this code:
        dev->unique_len = 40;
        dev->unique = drm_alloc(dev->unique_len + 1, DRM_MEM_DRIVER);
	...
        len = snprintf(dev->unique, dev->unique_len, "pci:%04x:%02x:%02x.%d",
...so it seems that dev->unique is never updated to reflect the
actual length of the string. The remaining bytes (20 in this case)
are random uninitialized bytes that are copied into userspace.
This patch fixes the problem by setting dev->unique_len after the
snprintf().
