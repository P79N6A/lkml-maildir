OK, thanks, will try tomorrow.
I put SCST 0.9.3-pre1 on its page 
(
http://sourceforge.net/projects/scst/
). This is not the latest, but 
this is the one, which working. At the end of this week I'll try to put 
there the latest one as well. Hope, you will learn some more lessons 
from it :).
Any comments are welcome.
