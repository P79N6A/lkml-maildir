Right, and as you also mentioned, it's identical case to exhausting
atomic pool, in either case we're out of resources, and in both cases the
machine may recover and be functional.  And sneaking around the rlimit
can cost ~4k per-process, which is why I'd consider the edge case a
reasonable loss.  (heck, maybe 4k is fine considering task size, and
mlock limits, etc).
