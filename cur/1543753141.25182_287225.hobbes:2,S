On a side note, I would say that this one is not particularly difficult to
apply, and Jari often includes up to date patches. Admittedly, when you want
to stick to an old kernel for a long time, it might become difficult. I've
been doing this for about 2 years now, and I cannot say that this one caused
me any nightmares yet. However, if it went into mainline, it would be better
of course !
Cheers,
Willy
