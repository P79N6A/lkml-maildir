I've renamed it __raw_writel().
I do _not_ want people to think that it's "faster".  It usually is, but
sometimes the speed difference simply does not exist (on PC's, for
example), and we don't want to have people using it just because of a
cool name.  That's why the name needs to be obscure and slightly
intimidating. 
So it's now __raw_writel(), and currently only the alpha actually does
it, because rth sent me patches that I then butchered.
I'll make a pre-14-2 with this all,
