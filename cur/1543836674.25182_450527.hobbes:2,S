I think the consensus if anything was more to adding AppArmor once it is
cleaned up than not. Its far more primitive than SELinux and has a very
basic security model but it can be easier to configure some basic setups
with it which makes it useful to some people
The LSM means the kernel doesn't have to have an opinion any more than
it has to define your choice of file system.

Thats why vendors ship policies. Firewalling has the same problem.
