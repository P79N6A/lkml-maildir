Whatever, I like BUILD_BUG_ON().

Honestly, I dislike the static check altogether, since it's tied too
closely to the implementation of independent code.  Since glibc will
break on > 1024 cpus, I'm not too concerned about the 10000+ CPU limit.

Because now you have silently truncated, which is much worse than
blowing up loudly.  My version also works correctly when sysfs starts
handing out two pages rather than one because something else needed it.
If you want to do this, then please do:
	len = cpumask_scnprintf(buf, PAGE_SIZE, mask);
	if (len == PAGE_SIZE)
		return -ENOMEM;

That would be extremely unusual; we tend not to panic even when things
are bad.  In this case, things are bad because of a static configuration
error, so I find it hard to really care...

I'll do it; seems like we need negotiation with Greg-KH, too.

That's not true.  I have faith in your abilities; I question anyone's
ability to produce a perfectly balanced solution without any external
input.
