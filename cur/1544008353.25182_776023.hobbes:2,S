Ok, after double checking the original patch again, I noticed that
struct request was getting released with __blk_put_request() from the
struct request->end_io() caller context in pscsi_req_done(), and again
after the original target mode CDB was acknowledged from the fabric in
pscsi_free_task() with blk_put_request()..  Not good.
Anyways, I removed the extra blk_put_request() in pscsi_free_task() and
am running some badblocks tests now.  Things are obviously looking much
better.
Thanks for your help,
