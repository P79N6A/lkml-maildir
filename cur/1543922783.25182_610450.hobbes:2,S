I don't think that POSIX is quite as explicit as that.  See

We're listening, really.  It's unacceptable that gcc should break
code.
However, fixing it is hard.  The best plan is probably to implement
(part of) the proposed standard memory model, and that requires
careful consideration.  We could in theory simply disable this
particular optimization, but that probably isn't a good idea on its
own because other optimizations might well break other code in a
similar way.  We need to have a very close look at the thread-safe
memory model in order to determine where we do things that might
break.
An official standard containing this is still at least two years out.
Andrew.
