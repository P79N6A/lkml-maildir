Well, that certainly is clean. How deep does it go? For instance, can
we you define it as:
	foo.bar.baz.bat.quux=99 -> mod 'foo.bar.baz.bat', parm 'quux'
so we get naming schemes like:
	net.3com.3c501.i=5
This would help much with keeping some of the namespaces cleaner. Do you
want any help with this?
