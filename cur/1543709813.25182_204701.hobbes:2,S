Generally it cannot be caused by changing kernel config (although kernel 
config can cause syscalls to be valid or not).
However, new kernel versions can add/remove stuff.  Usually stuff isn't 
removed for a while after its deprecated, but there have been instances 
where stuff has been added/changed/removed during unstable kernel 
development.
