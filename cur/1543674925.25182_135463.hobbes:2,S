   normally the softirq runs after the hardirq (commoncase) and you want to
   run those softirq computations on the idle cpu too (i.e. no userspace
   running so offload hardirq and in turn softqirq to it) No difference.
   softirq is like hardirq just longer and with hardirq enabled. One more
   reason to offload it to an idle cpu.
One hardirq can equate to thousands of packets worth of softirq load,
especially with NAPI.  And you cannot even know what this ratio is
(packets processed per hardware IRQ load).  It can be anywhere from
1 to 1000.  And you absolutely do not want to behave identically
for all such values.
How can you even claim to be taking this into account in a logical
manner if you cannot even tell me how you will determine how much
softirq load is created by a hardware irq?
