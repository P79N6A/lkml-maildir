So...to be sure I have things straight.../sys/cdev isn't really meant to be
there, and char devices wanting to do things in sysfs should be working
under /sys/devices or /sys/class or /sys/somethingelse?

I noticed there's no "private" member in the cdev structure.  So drivers
should embed the structure and use container_of to get their real structure
of interest?
[Forgive my ignorance here...] If I embed a struct cdev within my own
device structure, how do I know when I can safely free said device
structure?  Will there be a release method that gets exposed at the driver
level, or am I missing something obvious again?
Thanks,
