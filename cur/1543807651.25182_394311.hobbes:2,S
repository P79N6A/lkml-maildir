Subject: [RFC][PATCH] i386: incorrect xtime locking on resume
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/2/6/478

All,
	Nigel was asking about some suspend2 patches, and while looking at them
I noticed what looks to be a bug where jiffies and wall_jiffies are
modified without holding the xtime_lock in the resume path.
This patch should fix it, but I wanted to get some review and testing
done before I submit it.
thanks
