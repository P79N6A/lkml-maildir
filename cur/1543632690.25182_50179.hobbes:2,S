I'd like to say I reported this same problem a couple months ago...
1) I think it might be partly a timing/temperature issue.
2) it is possible to recover simply by ifdown the interfaces, then rmmod 
the module (assuming it is compiled as module...), then ifup the ifaces 
again.
3) I'm cc'ing this to Jeff Garzik, as I think he is the current 
maintainer of the tulip driver.
