Yeah, NO_IRQ would be NULL here...
What I do on the powerpc code is since IRQ HW numbers are defined
locally to a domain/PIC, when creating a new domain, The PIC code passes
a value to use as an "illegal" value in that domain. It's not exposed
outside of the core though, it's really only used to initialize the
remapping table with something before any interrupt on that PIC has been
mapped.

I think we do need proper refcounting, but I also think that most
drivers will not need to see it.
For example, a PCI driver will most probably just do something along the
lines of the existing request_irq(pdev->irq), the liftime of pdev->irq
is managed by the PCI core.
Same goes with MSIs imho, the MSI core can manage the lifetime
transparently.
