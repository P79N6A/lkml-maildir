Consider how you would make a connection between an interrupt being
triggered and a suspend occuring, bearing in mind that you require
a process context to perform a suspend.
You essentially have three options:
1. a kernel thread, to which you pass an event or trigger condition.
2. a userland daemon which waits for the interrupt via some special
   kernel interface and triggers a suspend via normal userspace
   channels.
3. some hotplug-triggered userspace method.
Note that both 2 and 3 have the same limitation - since they use normal
userspace channels which have no concept of "emergency suspend", it's
quite possible for (eg) a busy X server to inappropriately delay such a
suspend.
Therefore, I chose (1) as being the most appropriate solution.
