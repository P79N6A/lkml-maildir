OK.

I'm not sure that running do_fsync() will guarantee that all sys_write()
callers will have finished their syscall.  Probably they will have, in
practice.  But there is logic in the sync paths to deliberately bale out
if we're competing with ongoing dirtyings, to avoid livelocking.

Gee.  The only way I can think of guaranteeing this is with a full-on
freeze_processes/thaw_processes, which is the biggest synchronisation
barrier we have, apart from sys_reboot().
Now it just so happens that for ext2/3/4-style filesystems, we re-check
i_size inside the inner loop to handle concurrent truncates (see
i_size_read() calls in do_generic_mapping_read().
Perhaps the revoke() code can hook into there in some fashion to tell the
process-which-is-presently-running-read() that it is now reading crap.
That still doesn't give us a way of making revoke() wait until all
read()ers have finished their reads.
What you're trying to do here is very similar to truncate(), and truncate()
has had a lot of work put into it, and it does work.  So if revoke() were
to
a) grab i_mutex to keep write()s away
b) set i_size to zero
c) run truncate_inode_pages()
then I expect that you'll have the guarantees which you need.  This is
because the read() caller will synchronise against revoke() at each
lock_page(), and the read() caller will check i_size prior to locking each
page.
However, modifying i_size like this might be a problem - the inode could be
dirty and it'll get written to disk!  Perhaps we could change i_size_read()
to cheat and to return zero if there's a revoke in progress.

direct-io caches i_size for the whole operation and sometimes re-reads it. 
It does funky things to handle concurrent reads and writes.  Probably for
the DIO_LOCKING case we're OK, as direct-io has to re-check i_size_read()
after reacquiring i_mutex.  It's complex, but again, our path to success
here will be to piggyback on the existing handling of truncation.
