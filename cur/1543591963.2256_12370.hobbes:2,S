I don't know the standards Alan, but returning zero
from write() when f_pos is at s_maxbytes will make
a lot of apps hang up.  dd, bash and zsh certainly do.
Are they buggy?  Should they be testing the return value
of write() and assuming that zero is file-full?
The s_maxbytes logic is different from the
MAX_NON_LFS logic:
        /*
         *      LFS rule 
         */
        if ( pos + count > MAX_NON_LFS && !(file->f_flags&O_LARGEFILE)) {
                if (pos >= MAX_NON_LFS) {
                        send_sig(SIGXFSZ, current, 0);
                        goto out;
                }
This makes more sense.  If the file is full, and
you're trying to grow it, you fail.
