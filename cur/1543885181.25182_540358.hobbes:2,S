Thank you Linus for these detailed explanations.
I think I was frightened not by the wakeup logic, but by the possibility in 
SMP that a signal could be delivered to the thread just after it has been 
selected.
Looking again at ep_poll(), I see  :
			set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE);
[*]                     if (!list_empty(&ep->rdllist) || !jtimeout)
                                 break;
                         if (signal_pending(current)) {
                                 res = -EINTR;
                                 break;
                         }
So the test against signal_pending() is not done if an event is present in 
ready list : It should be delivered even if a signal is pending. I missed this 
bit ealier...
