Currently the answer is no.  We are actively developing a driver, but it will
take some months before it is ready.  My suggestion to you is that if you want a
sound card that works I would suggest one of the ISA or Sound Blaster PCI
(formerly Ensoniq) products.  These already have drivers available in the
kernel.
