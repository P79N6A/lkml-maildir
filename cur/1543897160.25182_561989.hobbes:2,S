This is impossible to answer unless somebody does the both

Talking ALSA developers into adapting OSS seems to be a dead end road.

Probably because of "two steps forward and one step back" rule. :)
Learning from history would mean moving forward and creating next generation

Depends on patches, just bring them on!
Having some competition would be a good thing for both ALSA and OSS.
