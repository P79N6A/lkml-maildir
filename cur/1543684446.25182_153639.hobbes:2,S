Can you give some details?
- When did it last work?
- What does it mean: "am unable to use"?
(Is the key ignored? Does the system crash? Do you get different keycodes?)
- What are the boot messages about the keyboard?
The pipe key is the same as the backslash key (say, on a US keyboard).
And there is some interesting confusion between Yen and Backslash
(since ASCII and JIS-Roman coincide, except in the yen and overbar
positions, where ASCII has backslash and tilde).
So, I am not surprised by weird things on a Japanese keyboard.
Do you use scancode Set 3?
