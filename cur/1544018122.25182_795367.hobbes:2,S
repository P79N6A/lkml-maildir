This error is caused by an IR code longer than 36 pulse/space periods.
Perhaps the Windows driver simply ignores this condition? Did you try
to remove the code that handles this case and where this message is
issued?

You can also try my USBtiny implementation, which also works with this
driver. It limits the number of periods to 35 by wrapping the last 16
periods:
