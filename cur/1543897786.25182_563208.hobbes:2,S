It isn't used on i386. On a 64-bit architecture, you need to put
compat_sys_time_pps_fetch() into the syscall table for 32-bit
processes. 
On PowerPC you do this by using COMPAT_SYS_SPU(time_pps_fetch) instead
of SYSCALL_SPU(..) in include/asm-powerpc/systbl.h. On x86_64 you'd put
it into the ia32_sys_call_table in arch/x86_64/ia32/ia32entry.S
