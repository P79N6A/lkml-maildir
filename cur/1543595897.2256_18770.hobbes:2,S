Subject: compile error about do_softirq in 2.4.5-ac21

I met following error while compiling 2.4.5-ac21:
I know, of course, this error was reported several times as the
compile problem of 2.4.6-preX, and there posted a patch about it
by Mr. Keith Owens. I confirmed It had been applied to
include/asm-i386/softirq.h of 2.4.5-ac21).
But I see this in 2.4.5-ac21 again, and confused so much.
I use Red Hat 7.1 (with up to latest errata updates + kernel-2.4.5-ac19,
glibc-2.2.3, gcc-2.96-88, binutils-2.11.90.0.15, etc.)
BTW, this error ocurred on both K6-II+ desktop(no-name) and Pentium III
500 MHZ noteboot(IBM ThkinPad 600X), and compiler was the same on both
machines.
Before trying to compile, I applied a patch about drivers/net/Config.in
posted to this list by Mr. Keith Owens.
Long lines were wrapped by me.
