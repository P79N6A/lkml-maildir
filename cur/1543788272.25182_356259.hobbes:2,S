There seems no strong reason not to use "unsigned long" for "type" and
besides that will provide the required alignment for the bitops
interfaces.  "unsigned int" is not sufficient.
Then we also don't need to thing about "does this work on big-endian
64-bit" and things of that nature.
Please audit your other bitops uses for this issue.
Thanks.
