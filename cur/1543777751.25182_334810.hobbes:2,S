And this is probably because the MD driver doesn't seem to see DM devices with 
the same names in 2.4 or in 2.6.
On my system, a typical "cat /proc/mdstat" with kernel 2.4 showed:
Personalities : [raid1] [raid5]
read_ahead 1024 sectors
md2 : active raid1 [dev fe:2e][2] [dev fe:2d][1] [dev fe:2c][0]
      1048704 blocks [2/2] [UU]
md3 : active raid5 [dev fe:1c][2] [dev fe:1b][1] [dev fe:1a][0]
      151556992 blocks level 5, 64k chunk, algorithm 2 [3/3] [UUU]
md0 : active raid1 [dev fe:18][2] [dev fe:17][1] [dev fe:16][0]
      261952 blocks [2/2] [UU]
md1 : active raid1 [dev fe:02][2] [dev fe:01][1] [dev fe:00][0]
      1048704 blocks [2/2] [UU]
unused devices: <none>
Where on the same system, in 2.6, it shows :
Personalities : [raid1] [raid5]
md3 : active raid5 dm-28[2] dm-27[1] dm-26[0]
      151556992 blocks level 5, 64k chunk, algorithm 2 [3/3] [UUU]
md2 : active raid1 dm-46[2] dm-45[1] dm-44[0]
      1048704 blocks [2/2] [UU]
md1 : active raid1 dm-2[2] dm-1[1] dm-0[0]
      1048704 blocks [2/2] [UU]
md0 : active raid1 dm-24[2] dm-23[1] dm-22[0]
      261952 blocks [2/2] [UU]
unused devices: <none>
As you can see, in kernel 2.4, MD sees DM devices all called "fe:<number>", 
and it may interpret all these "fe:<number>" as being the same physical 
device (fe).
In 2.6, MD sees DM devices as called "dm-<number>", and it may interpret all 
these "dm-<number>" as being all different physical devices.
It may have something to do with the way the MD driver parses/understands the 
devices names/numbers, the ":" or "-", etc.
But this is just a supposition, some kernel-knowledgeable folk should probably 
take a look at the DM code to understand this better.
(I'll be on travel for the week and may or may not have access to my email ;-)
