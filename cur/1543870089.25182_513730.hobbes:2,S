Ok, now that I can run this on more than x86, I gave it a spin on a box
with a little more potent storage. This is a core 2 quad, disks are
7200rpm sata (with NCQ) and a 15krpm SCSI disk. IO scheduler is
deadline.
SATA disk:
Engine          Depth      Batch	Bw (KiB/sec)
----------------------------------------------------
libaio		64	   8		17,486
syslet		64	   8		17,357
libaio		20000	   8		17,625
syslet		20000	   8		16,526
sync            1          1             7,529
SCSI disk:
Engine          Depth      Batch	Bw (KiB/sec)
----------------------------------------------------
libaio		64	   8		20,723
syslet		64	   8		20,742
libaio		20000	   8		21,125
syslet		20000	   8		19,610
sync            1          1            16,659

Not if you want to take advantage of hw queuing, as in this random
workload. fio being a test tool, it's important to be able to control as
many aspects of what happens as possible. That means you can also do
things that you do not want to do in real life, having a pending list of
20000 serialized requests is indeed one of them. It also means you
pretty much have to know what you are doing, when testing little details
like this.
