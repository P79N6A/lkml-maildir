	Well , You are completely right on this one .  I have Dave's 1.11
	running at this time & the same conditions appear .  I beleive
	that it will appear at times of zero traffic for long periods
	& will show the intermittant halts during medium to high traffic .
	I now beleive that the Netgear hub is failing and have purchased
	a switch to replace it with .  But it is odd that no other port on
	the hub is showing this behaviour .  One more try by moving the
	cable to the other set of ports .

	I am still going to test these out as well w/ speedo_debug set to
	3 thruout all tests .  Will report back , as soon as I have time .
		Again Thank You,  JimL
