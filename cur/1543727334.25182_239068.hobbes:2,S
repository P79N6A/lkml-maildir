Bit interesting.
On the final analysis, what was the cause of this problem?
I found the following in progguide-8100(100).pdf. Does this help something?
2.5 Software Issues
This section covers the handling of various data reception topics.
    1. Handling a Receive Buffer Overflow:
       The Rx DMA (FIFO to buffer) is stopped. The CAPR must be
       updated first to dismiss the ISR (RxBufferOverflow) event. The
       correct actions to process RxBufOvw are:
           a. Update CAPR.
           b. Write a 1 to ISR (ROK).
       The Rx DMA resumes after step b.
    2. Handling RxFIFOOvw:
       When RxFIFOOvw occurs, all incoming packets are discarded.
       Clearing ISR (RxFIFOOvw) doesn t dismiss the RxFIFOOvw event.
       To dismiss the RxFIFOOvw event, the ISR (RxBufOvw) must be
       written with a 1.
