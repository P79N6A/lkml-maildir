I would hope that most of them were already maxing out the disk with the
2.2.x setup, so 2.3.x can't improve much on that.
There are certainly cases where we do much worse, simply because some of
the 2.3.x code changes behaviour a _lot_, and no real tuning has taken
place, so I'm not surprised if some of the initial numbers aren't as
good as they should be.
You could try pre-2.3.8-2, which has at least some problems in plain
2.3.7 fixed.

These are hopefully fixed.
