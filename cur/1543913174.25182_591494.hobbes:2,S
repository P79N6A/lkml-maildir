We're seeing this identical timeout starting with 2.6.21, any time we try and
push a significant amount of traffic through the nforce ethernet.  We've rolled
back to 2.6.20.18 and don't see any problems.  It seems that this bug got
introduced along with all the forcedeth fixes and optimizations in 2.6.21.
