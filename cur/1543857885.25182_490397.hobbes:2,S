It's certainly the slice and idling hurting here. But at the same time,
I don't really think your test case is very interesting. The test area
is very small and you have 16 threads trying to read the same thing,
optimizing for that would be silly as I don't think it has much real
world relevance.
That said, I might add some logic to detect when we can cheaply switch
queues instead of waiting for a new request from the same queue.
Averaging slice times over a period of time instead of 1:1 with that
logic, should help cases like this while still being fair.
