btw., Harvey Harrison has cleaned them up some more, and has told me 
about KCONFIG_ALLCONFIG, which is very useful when you want to tailor 
randconfig builds to different testsystems (which might have different 
minimum driver requirements and different distro requirements for kernel 
features). Harvey, could you send the latest version of those 
auto-Kconfig cleanups?
