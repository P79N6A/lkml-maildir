The display is shifted, WITH wraparound : the end of the line is at the
beginning of the following one ...

No, I'm not sure ... so I've tested the parameters you mention : 
timmings 39721 48 16 33 10 96 2
I copied the following block in /etc/fb.modes
mode "640x480-60"
    # D: 25.200 MHz, H: 31.500 kHz, V: 59.999 Hz
    geometry 640 480 640 480 8
    timings 39683 48 16 33 10 96 2
    accel true
    rgba 8/0,8/0,8/0,0/0
endmode
With these parameters, the command 'fbset -match -a' is enough to reset the
display to normal operation. So, you was right.

I use Debian 2.2 and ... grub. But I've tested with lilo too. With the sae
results. The cmdline is not truncated.

This does not work ... I've to use the fbset command to reset the display to
normal operation after login in (or in an automatic command at boot time in
/et/init.d). This works, but I've lost the logo  ;-)
