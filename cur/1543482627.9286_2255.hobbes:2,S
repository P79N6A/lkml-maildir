Hello guys,
The infamous "ldd core" problem seems to only occur under the following
circumstances:
1. the core file is fresh - i.e. you run your cor.c program and then
immediately do ldd core.
2. More importantly than 1., it happens when there is some swap space
in use - and does not happen when 0 bytes of swap are in use.
Keep looking and you shall find (for there is nothing hidden that shall 
not be revealed).
Regards,
