   Wrong is a strong word for a change that makes it work for some people without
   obvious negative side effects.
Ummm, sed 's/obvious/known/'  We don't know what the patch
even does.
   That is good news, but does not change my arguments about fixing up
   the eepro driver at all :)
   
The point is that once we see what works in the e100 driver (and Jeff
and I are making them document the bits) we can add the same fix
to eepro100.c
   
Franks a lot,
