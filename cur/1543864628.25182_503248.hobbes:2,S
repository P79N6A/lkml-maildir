This is a really nasty problem.  By and large, only organisations who
are active participants in the Linux community are happy sending their
technical architects ungaurded to a developer summit (like we get for
the CPU panel).  The objective is always to get technical (not
marketing) people who haven't been frightened into silence by their
legal department and, if people want chipsets, that's what we'll try to
do ... it just takes a lot of persuasion, so the earlier we start ...
