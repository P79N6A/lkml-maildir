Is it still possible to add this patch to 2.4 (i.e. 2.4.28 or 2.4.29),
or is it too late/too invasive?
[PATCH] fix ELF exec with huge bss

AFAIK, this patch has been in 2.6 for several months and has been in Red
Hat Enterprise Linux 3 kernels for a long while too. The reason I'd like
to see it in a future 2.4 kernel is that it fixes some crashes that some
of my users are seeing (e.g. with a Fortran 77 program that has a BSS
larger than 2GB).
BTW, if the above patch is added to 2.4, maybe this patch is also needed
to handle a corner case (like the previous patch, it's been in 2.6 for
several months and RHEL 3 for a long time):
