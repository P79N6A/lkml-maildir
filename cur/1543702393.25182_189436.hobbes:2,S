OK, I did that. Patches against 2.6.1-rc3 in separate mails.
I split the changes into two patches:
1. The Documentation/ part.
   - Only changes documentation files.
   - No conflicts with code patches possible.
2. The code comment part.
   - Changes *.c, *.h, Kconfig and relates files.
   - May cause conflicts with code patches.
Regards,
Uli
