"elfcorehdr=" also looks good.

Exactly. There shall be one Elf header for whole of the image. In
addition there will be one struct Elf64_Phdr, per contiguous physical
memory area. One Elf64_Phdr of PT_NOTE type for notes section and one
Elf64_Phdr for backup region.

I hope, all elf headers once prepared by kexec-tools need not to change
later (Cannot think of any piece of information which shall change
later). These shall be put in separate segment. And SHA-256 shall take
care of authenticity of information after crash.

For notes section program header, virtual = physical = 0 and "offset"
shall point to crash_notes[], so that notes can directly be read by the
capture kernel (or user space).
