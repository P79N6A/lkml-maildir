The RFC you mention, says that before using an address the machine may
ARP for its own IP address. This is the normal "gratuitous ARP" that
started this discussion. 
We've decided that "refusing to use the given IP" is not good, and
that at most we can print a warning, and continue. Fine. 
But if, as you say, we can get to see our own ARP packets back, we'll
respond, and notice a conflict too. (*) I'd say that getting your own
packets back unexpectedly is always a VERY BAD situation.
If you're right the patch may need to be extended and check if the
hardware address is one of our own. On the other hand, if we get a
message every minute or so when the network is spewing our own packets
back at us isn't all THAT bad.
