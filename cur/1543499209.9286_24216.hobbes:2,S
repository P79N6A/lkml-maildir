I have been shopping around to purchase 60 NIC cards.  There seems to be a
broad range in prices between $8 to $100 for PCI bus master NIC cards.
What type of performance differences would I see in using say a $10 bus
master Generic NIC (10/100) card instead of a say $50 to $100 3COM
(10/100) NIC. Is there any real justification for purchasing the more
expensive cards for creating a LINUX cluster
Thanks for the help.
