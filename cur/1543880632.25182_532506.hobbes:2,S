Well, I guess we need to make a decision whether moving this kind of
devices into a force feedback layer is possible or whether every
device needs to have an application specifically tailored to that
particular device.
If we say that it is feasible to plug a device into FF layer then we
must not expose hardware implementation details. That means that
device-sepcific translation between 3d vector of forces into motor
torques must be done by the driver itself.
For devices that require tailored application (for example that glove
- I am not sure how a generic application could control it) old
phantom way of controlling via ioctl will suffice. The device may
still use input layer to report back coordinates.
