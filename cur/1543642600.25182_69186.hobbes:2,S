Hi Dave,
yes, you`re right with the athlon-4 option. Well, first thing, the mobile athlon
have the same core as XP (Palomino) expect some "speed scheudle". 
I never see that we support mobile chips. So i think it`s enough that we 
put Athlon4 into the "XP group". I think too the new core "Thoroughbread" 
should use the "XP group". 
I readed the gcc documentation, gcc-3.2 only, very deep. This was the idea for this patch.
Then i looked fast into gcc-3.1/3.0/2.95x. I believe that the compiler create own code 
for *every* chip-release. chip-release as: athlon-tbird, athlon-xp, ...
Also take a look into the binary code and size. It`s different. 
chears,
Daniel
