BSD 4.3 and Unix V7 source is browsable online at
http://tamacom.com/unix/
Choose "V7" and search for "mfree".
The source being online is possible because the V1 - V7 source was
put under a BSD-like license by Caldera in 2002. A copy of the license
is still at 
ftp://minnie.tuhs.org/UnixArchive/Caldera-license.pdf
(there's much more at 
ftp://minnie.tuhs.org/UnixArchive/,
 including
V6, V7 and 2.11BSD source).
So, in this particular case this doesn't seem to be a problem.
Mike.
