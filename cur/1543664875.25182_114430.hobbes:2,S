It appears something is conflicting with the old Adapatec AIC7xxx.  My
system halts when it attempts to probe the devices (I think it's that.) 
So I started using the new AIC7xxx driver and all is well.  I don't see
any messages to the console that points to any causes.  Is there
someplace I can look for a clue to the problem?
I actually didn't realize I was using the old driver and have no qualms
about not using it, but if it'll help someone else, I can help gather
information.
