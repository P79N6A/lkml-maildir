My current plan is to switch in 2.6.20 to automatic probing of more pins
for the timer routing (suggested by Tim Hockin, I've got a test patch). 
But that's too risky for .19.
For 2.6.19 we'll likely add some more PCI-IDs disabling the quirk
and a command line option to disable the skip timer override quirk. 
Doing this per PCI ID isn't that bad because afaik Vista certification
requires enabling the HPET table and I assume most boards will get
Vista certification soon. This will force Asus to fix their BIOS.
Can people who use a Nvidia based AM2/SocketF board (especially when they have timer 
troubles but otherwise would be useful too) please report their lspcis in private 
mail to me?
