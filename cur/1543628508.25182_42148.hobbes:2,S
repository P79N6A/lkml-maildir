the powers that be consider this a feature, for reasons i've never quite
understood.  your question comes up regularly, and typically the
suggestion is some convoluted filtering thing, and i've never been
sufficiently convinced the filter is worth the overhead.  (especially in
my case when i wanted two interfaces for performance reasons.)
last i investigated this problem the kernel actually sent arp responses
out *both* interfaces, and it was basically a race condition as to which
the recipient would use.
anyhow, below is a patch i created for 2.4.2... hopefully it still works.
apply this and also disable proxy arp in /proc/somewhere.
