I can't say I agree. I thought it is good to have a struct which represents
a kernel thread. Actually, I thought we can have __kthread_create() which
returns "struct kthread". May be I am wrong, because yes, ->set_child_tid can
point right to completion, and we can use some TIF flag instead of ->should_stop.
This needs to update a lot of include/asm/ files.

Hm? kthread_stop() does wake_up_process(), it wakes up TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE tasks.

Yes, thanks... Can't understand how I was soooo stupid!!! thanks...
Damn. We don't need 2 completions! just one.
	create_kthread:
		pid = kernel_thread(...);
		if (pid < 0) {
			create->result = ERR_PTR(pid);
			complete(create->started);
		}
		// else: kthread() will do complete()
		return;
