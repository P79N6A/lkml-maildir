Going back to your original oops

this looks similar to one I saw with 2.6.8.1 on a machine here on its
first upgrade to 2.6.x - except it was with totally different modules
(oops in kobject_add reached via pnp_register_driver loading ns558).

It turned out to be due to hotplug loading a buggy module earlier in the
boot, which did a pnp_register_driver and then aborted the module load
when it found nothing, without unregistering itself. The problem went
away with 2.6.9-rc2 for me, the offending module (cs4232) seems to be
fixed.  So it's worth looking for any modules that failed to load
earlier in the boot, they could be leaving junk in pci_bus_type.drivers
.
