    I have the same problems with repeating keys when
running under battery vs AC power with the later 2.5.6x
kernels on an IBM T20. It goes away when i plug in
the AC adaptor or boot w/o acpi. The only other oddity
i've noticed is that i have to cntrl-alt-del TWICE
to get it to reboot, the first one does jack, but
i'm not blaming that on the kernel just yet ;p
