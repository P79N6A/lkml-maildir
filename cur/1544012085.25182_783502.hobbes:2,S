We know the register's always MMIO on this controller, so it's slightly 
more optimal to avoid the conditional in there.

Not sure. Documentation/memory-barriers.txt seems rather unfortunately 
vague on whether MMIO writes are strongly ordered with respect to memory 
writes. I seem to recall some debate on this a while ago, did it ever 
get resolved?
