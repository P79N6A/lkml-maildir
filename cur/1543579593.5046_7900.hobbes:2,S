Yeah, this is a big problem.
Parted solves it, by defining a clobber() operation for each file system
type (which can/should be extended to RAID, if/when we get around to
supporting it properly).  clobber() removes all signatures.
So, I guess the short answer is: mke2fs should remove the RAID super.
For those of you who don't like all-in-one libraries like libparted -
not mentioning any Christo^Wnames - you could probably have
clobber.ext2,
etc.
However, you would want to have a comprehensive set of clobber.*.
Fortunately, clobber.X is going to be very small, so this should be
a problem.
So, the alternative is to define a RAID partition "data" type.  (And
forget about IDs for file systems)
