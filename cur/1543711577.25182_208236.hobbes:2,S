Jens sent me the perfect strace log, after his help it has not been
difficult to spot the bug. this incremental should fix it
MAP_SHARED|MAP_ANONYMOUS isn't very common and my userspace never
triggered it. I placed the pgoff anon setting in the path of the shared
memory too, that generated the sigbus. Leaving the setting only in the
MAP_PRIVATE should fix it, the anonymous memory is only MAP_PRIVATE.
patch is untested at the moment, as soon as I get confirmation I'll
upload an update.
thanks!
