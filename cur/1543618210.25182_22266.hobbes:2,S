This can be a gcc problem.  Some versions of gcc generate internal
calls to memset and memcpy when manipulating structures.  Because these
internal calls are created after cpp they end up as phantom calls to
functions instead of being converted by string.h.
If it is a gcc problem, you track it down by first identifying the object
  nm -A drivers/isdn/eicon/*.o | fgrep memset
then compile the xxx object with -S
  make CFLAGS_xxx.o=-S SUBDIRS=drivers/isdn/eicon modules
vi drivers/isdn/eicon/xxx.o looking for calls to memset.  Scroll up
until you find the function that that is generating the call, then
eyeball the code looking for structure assignments like s = *foo or s =
0.  Replace the assignments with explicit calls to memcpy or memset.
