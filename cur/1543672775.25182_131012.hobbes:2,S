For drive->addressing, not hwif.

Maybe a define or two would help here. When you see drive->addressing
and hwif->addressing, you assume that they are used identically. That
!hwif->addressing means 48-bit is ok, while !drive->addressing means
it's not does not help at all.
#define IDE_LBA28	0
#define IDE_LBA48	1
and then change hwif->addressing to be addressed like the drive variant
would help a whole lot.
