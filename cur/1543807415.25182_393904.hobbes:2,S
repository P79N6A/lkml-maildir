I don't see the benefit really. It can be as well provided by 
a userspace library 
Many of the debug tools don't even work on /dev/mem, but use
different interfaces (/proc/kcore, gdb remote protocol etc.) 
Also raw1394 could possibly be used to cause interrupts
on the target and also stop the target CPU this way.
