Hello, I'm using 2.4.2-ac24, Xfree86 4.0.2 + 4.0.3 upgrade, 
Glide_V3-2.60-16 & Glide_V3-DRI-3.10-6, and tdfx framebuffer.
My system is a 2x200MMX on a Gigabyte 586DX with 96Mb, a Voodoo3 2000 
pci and a bt848 tv card.
I have the card working ok, except for a few nonstopers.
- I cannot use the 3D part of my card with XFree 4.x (it worked with 
3.3.x) it doesn't matter whether I use or not tdfx.o or whether or not I 
put a LoadModule dri in the XF86Config. Only root can run the test3Dfx 
program, and when the program finish X is restored but freezed, so I 
have to do a SysRQ-K to kill it.
- If I try to use fbtv (watch tv in FB) the system hangs, the program 
starts, and I can see the tv on the screen, but the system is freezed.
- If I put a LoadModule dri in the XF86Config, I cannot use the virtual 
consoles. If I go to a text console (tdfx frame buffer at 100x37) I see 
the contents of the text console (issue and login prompt), but I see a 
line near the top of the console of random pixels of one pixel that 
paints pixels from left to rigth from top to botttom, and I cannont see 
what I'm typing. I can ony come back to X. When I'm on that VT if I 
switch to another VT I still see the contents of the first VT that I 
switched from X.
Thanks for your patience.
