Here i agree with Stefan, especially as this also would only
make a difference for one (struct config_table) of those four structs
and there it would vastly decrease readability.

Yes, but on the other hand now all those driver specific numbers
are grouped together in the beginning of nozomi.c and it also
could happen there once will appear other cards or models of it
that this nozomi driver could handle.

Its just a misleading comment, but i changed it.
Besides that i also removed an error and a warning the current
checkpatch.pl now showed up ("trailing statments should be on next
line" and a "inline preferred over __inline-__").
