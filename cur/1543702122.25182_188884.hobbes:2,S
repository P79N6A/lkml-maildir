Note: you're not supposed to need to do "request_mem_region()" for modern 
drivers. You should only need to claim ownership of the resources, and the 
PCI driver interfaces should do that automatically.
What you should do for resources you know about is to just _create_ them. 
Not necessarily request them (although that is one way of creating them), 
but you can literally just tell the kernel that they are there. That will 
already mean that anybody else that tries to allocate a resource will 
avoid that area.
So if you know the hardware is there, and it _tells_ you it's there
(unlike, say, an ISA device), you can just call "request_mem_region()"  
without ever even checking the error return (although you had better make
sure that the name allocation is stable if you are a module - don't want
to start oopsin in /proc if the module gets unloaded).
The PCI layer already does all of that for the "standard" resources. It's 
just that the generic code can't do it for nonstandard regions, so drivers 
for chips that don't have just the regular BAR things should create their 
own resource entries..
