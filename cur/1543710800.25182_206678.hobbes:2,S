The code on openib.org? Yes, I wrote some of it.
I would be the first to say that there are portions that need to be
rewritten, but I definately do not think all or even most of it does.
That's why I was asking what specifically you found fatally wrong with
it. I haven't seen many critiques, so I can only assume it's the same
things I see wrong with it.

I don't see why a smarter client, or mail filter, couldn't do the same
thing without depending on the behaviour of the sender.
