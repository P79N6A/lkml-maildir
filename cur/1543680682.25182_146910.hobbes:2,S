Do we have distributions that intend to make releases using those? I
suspect not, but hey, don't get me wrong: I'd love to see them working
out-of-the-box.
It's purely a matter of priorities. The only architecture that really 
_has_ to be stable is x86. Others are determined largely by whether they 
get their own testing done, and companies and individuals being willing to 
put the resources down.
