Hi Mike,
Here is how I wire into the timer interrupt:
   inline void smp_local_timer_interrupt(struct pt_regs * regs)
   {
        int cpu = smp_processor_id();
 
	if (!run_posix_timers((void *)regs))
                return;
        ... the original code continues.
I keep an in kernel Posix style timer queued for each cpu at
HZ frequency.  If this timer has expired run_posix_timers returns
true and the normal local timer processing is done.
The code is not perfect yet.  I don't honour changes in the 
profiling multiplier.
