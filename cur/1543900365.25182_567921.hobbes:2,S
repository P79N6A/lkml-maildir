I really doubt that kexec(a special kernel) is going to solve anything here.
The new kernel will have to initialize, probe for devices, etc.
Which will take time.
Which will slow down hibernate to an unacceptable degree.
Right now, it (TuxOnIce) is *very* fast.
Adding 10 seconds or so for reprobing/resetting/reiniting devices
is not going to be useful.
And modifying all of the drivers to *not* do their usual probe sequence
sounds rather intrusive and is likely also a non-starter here.
Or is it?
Cheers
