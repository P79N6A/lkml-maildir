Well, sometimes it _does_ matter from a correctness standpoint. For 
example, gcc without optimizations was simply unusable, because of the 
lack of inlining or the lack of even trivial optimizations (ie static dead 
code removal).
And a (unrelated) gcc list thread showed that even with just -O1, one 
particular project had gone from 131 seconds (gcc-2.7.2) to 180 seconds 
(2.95.3) to 282 seconds (3.3) to 327 seconds (the tree-ssa branch).
