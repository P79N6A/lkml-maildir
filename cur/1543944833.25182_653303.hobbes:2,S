Sorry again for being too harsh (see my other email).
Every kernel release has a big amount of API changes that have not been 
announced previously, and that's a fact that is rooted in the kernel

Otherwise everyone also had to announce now if he wanted to e.g. change 
a function prototype or a struct in 2.6.28.
