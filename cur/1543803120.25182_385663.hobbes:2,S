So, what's supposed to happen in a threaded program where one thread 
does an epoll_ctl on an epoll fd while another thread is currently 
waiting in epoll_wait on the same fd? In particular, what happens if a 
thread does an EPOLL_CTL_DEL on one of the fds that is currently being 
waited on? Is there a possibility of an event being returned on the fd 
even after the EPOLL_CTL_DEL completes?
