Yes, but in most cases no scrolling is neccessary, so occasional
scrolling is not that bad. However, I found some long prompts are
clipped, too, and there you can not scroll because <left>/<right>
switches between <Select>, <Exit> and <Help>. The complete prompt
can be found in the help screen with scrolling. E.g.:
  │ │    <M>   DiskOnChip 2000, Millennium and Millennium Plus (NAND
reimp│ │
  │ Prompt: DiskOnChip 2000, Millennium and Millennium Plus (NAND
reimplementation) (EXPERIMENTAL) │
Again, most prompts are sufficiently readable on an 80 character
terminal.
