I use X.org with the following mouse configuration:

This is to make sure that the scroll wheel shows up as 4/5 as expected,
and that the horizontal scroll shows up as 6/7, which most software
interprets as the left/right scroll buttons.
Xev says that the horizontal scrollers produce:
Scroll Left:

And right:

I'm being very careful not accidentally press the horizontal scroller
buttons. If there's a different mouse configuration I'm supposed to be
using here, I'd love to hear it. I spent alot of time trying out various
configurations under the 2.6.10 to find one that made everything
(including the cruise control buttons, which still don't work quite
right... see: 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1786
 ) working.
Various software versions below.
