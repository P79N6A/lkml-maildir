hi all
I'n working on server setup with some 16 disks in RAID-5; one of them a 
spare. After a little reading, I find myself longing for support for 
RAID-6 support in kernel, giving the opportunity to allow for two failed 
drives without a chrash (see links about RAID-6 below if interested).
I am aware of that not all kernel hackers like such configurations, and
that some will rather see small RAID-configurations connected with VLM.  
I beleive there is a reason for using RAID-6, and RAID-controller vendors
(such as Compaq) are already using them, so why shouldn't linux do so
also? With a high number of cheap IDE drives, the chance of one failing is 
quite high, so why not RAID-6? At least for a system doing most reads...
thanks
roy
