 ---------------------------
 
-What:	register_serial/unregister_serial
-When:	September 2005
-Why:	This interface does not allow serial ports to be registered against
-	a struct device, and as such does not allow correct power management
-	of such ports.  8250-based ports should use serial8250_register_port
-	and serial8250_unregister_port, or platform devices instead.
