no, the bios doesn't matter here, because it is only
used after the cpu is reset. Since you get an oops,
the cpu has not been reset yet.

interesting ;-)

it seems that the function reboot_setup has been
overwritten by something, because this is absolutely
not its code. I've just disassembled it to compare,
and it contains some *real* code, not junk like here.
I can't see in my code what could overwrite
reboot_setup before it is called. Could you try to
dump it before pressing Sysrq+d, please ?
TIA.
Willy
