	I know its only a few bytes, but, just in the interests
of code readability and having a consistent standard across the
rest of kernel, let me suggest putting it in MODULE_DESCRIPTION()
if you want the user to be able to extract it from the module binary.
Using MODULE_DESCRIPTION would have the following advantages:
	1. Does not consume unswappable kernel space.
	2. Allows these information strings to be handled in a
	   uniform manner in the future.
	3. Makes it easier to support this information in tools more
	   precise than "strings module.o | grep ..."
	I can resubmit my patch with this change if anybody wants me to.
