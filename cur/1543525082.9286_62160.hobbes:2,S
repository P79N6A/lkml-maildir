That's what I said.  E.g., you have a zone starting at 4k that's 32k
long.  You initialise the allocator by calling free_page on each page.
The buddy structure ends up looking like this:
      4k  @ 4k
      16k @ 8k
      4k  @ 24k
In other words, you get aligned allocations without having to align the
zones.  As far as I can see, it's a simple matter of making the "get
my opposite buddy page" logic use absolute address values instead of
zone-relative ones.

I guess that's what I said too, but I don't see why aligning the zone is
needed.  May as well leave zones representing actual memory ranges,
rather than some artificially aligned ranges for no obvious reason.
Less work for people writing ports, less to go invisibly wrong...
