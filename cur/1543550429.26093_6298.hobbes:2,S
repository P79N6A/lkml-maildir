One small warning though. Please don't apply that patch
yet because I fixed 3 more small problems today. I'll
send you an updated patch...
- the compile warnings are fixed
- in try_to_free_pages(), we forgot to set
  PF_MEMALLOC in current->flags  (oops)
- in grow_buffers(), in case we cannot get a
  buffer head, we must unlock the page
A patch against 2.4.0-test9-pre8 with these 3 changes will
be on its way once I've tested it a bit...
regards,
Rik
