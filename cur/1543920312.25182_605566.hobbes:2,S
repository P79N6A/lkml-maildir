My (practical) experience is that I couldn't guarantee which card was
which. (I remember once where it changed over a kernel re-compile) So
my solution, before Debian's persistent naming scheme appeared, was to
check it after every new kernel and make sure my config matched up
with the names of the physical interfaces.

Well, yes and no. My gut feeling is that it's probed like PCI cards
are. They're initialised when the drivers are loaded, and not before,
as such, there are no guarantees which card will be initialised first.
- and anyway, what happens if you plug them in in a different order?

Ok, firstly the 100baseT adapter will be named something like ethX,
the wireless card will most likely be named something like wlanX.
Now let's say your laptop has a built in ethernet card.
So, we'll assume a modular kernel, with the module "usbnet" for the
usb card and "e100" for the onboard card:
If the "usbnet" module is loaded first, then initially, according to
the kernel, the usb card will be eth0 and the built in one eth1.
Now let's assume that, on the PCI bus, the USB controller is in a
lower slot number than the network card. (highly likely, given that
the network card is most likely external to the chipset of the laptop)
It's pretty likely that the USB controller will have it's module
loaded first, before the built in network card. At this point, it'll
send out hotplug events for all it's children (root hubs, etc.) and
eventually an event will be sent out for the usb network card. Now, at
this point, it's impossible to say which one will claim eth0 first.
Now, in my case, with my two wireless cards, what happens if I plug
the 802.11b/g one in first? If this fancy renaming didn't happen, it'd
end up with the name wlan0 and, hence, try to connect to the network
which the 802.11a one is supposed to connect to.
This is not a good thing.
I also have to make the point that this has been happening all over
the kernel, well before I started using it. Video4Linux and DVB
devices can be USB, and the order the /dev/videoX nodes appear in is
determined by the plugging order. IRDA cards, sound cards, usb
devices, framebuffers, mice, keyboards, loopback devices, etc. all
have the same "issue". (and annoyingly, they all have different ways
of getting around it, or not)
And to make one final point, getting right back to the initial parts
of the discussion, at the end of the day, your SATA disk, IDE disk,
USB disk and the CF card in your camera are all mass storage devices -
they all work in a fairly similar way. You want to mount filesystems
from all of them, and when you run low level tools, like parted or
whatever, you want them all to behave in the same way. If the kernel
abstract away the nastinesses of talking SATA, IDE, USB mass storage,
or CF - and hence, make them all behave in the same, standard, way,
why the hell not?
