A database application really should be taking care of the writeback
scheduling itself, rather than hoping that the kernel behaves optimally.
yeah, it'd be nice if the kernel was perfect.  But in the real world,
there will always be gains available by smart use of (say)
sync_file_range().  Because the application knows more about its writeout
behaviour (especialy _future_ behaviour) than the kernel ever will.

Yes, the XFS guys have said that some machines run out of puff when
only one CPU is doing writeback.
