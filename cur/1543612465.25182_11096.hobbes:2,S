That is exactly what I am doing, adding kbuild 2.5 and CML2 then
removing kbuild 2.4 and CML1 in a later step.  Neither Eric nor I want
to parallel run the old and new systems for more than one kernel
release in 2.5.  Neither Eric nor I want to parallel run kbuild 2.5 and
CML2 in the 2.4 kernels, we only did the work there because we had no
development tree.
