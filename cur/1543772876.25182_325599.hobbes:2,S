I don't want it to reboot, I guess I got confused.  As you say, maybe
something is wrong with the stack.  It's weird that something would be
wrong with the stack, because the other test to check the
suspend/resume code path works like a charm, the machine will do the
fake suspend/resume just fine.
So the bios must be messing up the stack right?  Is there a way to
examine or dump the stack so that we can compare the stack when
windows does the suspend/resume compared to when linux does it?
thanks,
Jason
