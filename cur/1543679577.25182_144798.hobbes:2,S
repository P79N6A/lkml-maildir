Yes you can, i thought about the same thing, but it simply generates 
unecessary APIC bus traffic and just sounds horrid. Not to mention it 
doesn't sound all that friendly on larger systems. But if you're using 
smp_call_function you're not really all that speed critical anyway, so 
this should suffice.
