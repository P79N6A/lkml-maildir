When you need to access certain physical offsets or bus addresses
from user-space, we use mmap().

You can place your code and your data at some fixed (offset) by
using different sections (i.e., .section .foo), then having
the linker do the fixups. You CANNOT move the .text section or
the .bss or the .data sections and have anything work. You also
can't put the stack at some physical location because there are
different stacks in use when your module is accessed (each
caller has its own "kernel" stack).
