OK, well the timing of a merge is mainly up to you guys, especially as the
subsystem is pretty raw and you're the only people who use it ;)
Two things from a quick scan:
a) In many places the patch does
	if (p)
		kfree(p);
   But kfree(0) is permitted.  The cleanup police will be after you at
   some stage - it'd be best to fix those things up immediately.
b) The patch exports a ton of symbols to non-GPL modules:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(ib_create_ah_from_wc);
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(ib_modify_mad);
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(ib_create_send_mad);
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(ib_free_send_mad);
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(ib_coalesce_recv_mad);
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(ib_sa_service_rec_query);
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(ib_create_cm_id);
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(ib_destroy_cm_id);
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(ib_cm_listen);
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(ib_send_cm_req);
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(ib_send_cm_rep);
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(ib_send_cm_rtu);
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(ib_send_cm_dreq);
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(ib_send_cm_drep);
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(ib_send_cm_rej);
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(ib_send_cm_mra);
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(ib_send_cm_lap);
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(ib_send_cm_apr);
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(ib_send_cm_sidr_req);
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(ib_send_cm_sidr_rep);
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(ib_cm_establish);
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(ib_cm_init_qp_attr);
   Why?
