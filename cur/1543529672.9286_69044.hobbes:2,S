I instead propose to not make the kernel preemtable but to take the other
way around marking some special section as preemtable.
if (need_resched is set && (the irq happened
    on top of userspace || atomic_read(&cpu_preemtable) is != 0))
	reschedule()
That won't harm the locking fast path (as a preemtable kernel would do),
it won't have side effects and it will provide the same low latency for
the copy_user (or similar section of code) without having to add the ugly
and slow explicit checks for need_resched.
Comments?
