The " != 0" is completely superfluous.  Above NULL check is a matter
of taste, this one demonstates lack of boolean algebra understanding.

Hmm.  And your taste seems to change. :)

And since we're on the subject.  Ignoring the recent discussion
involving akpm, viro and others, the kernel historically used int both
for integer and boolean, plus return values as a special kind of
"boolean with error indication attached".
For boolean, it is nicer to do things like "if (!error)", for
integers, a comparison as above is nicer.  Return codes fall into the
boolean category.  Pointers after kmalloc() and similar are viewed as
rich boolean by some people, but not by all.
