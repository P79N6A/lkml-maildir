Hello!
> I also balk at implicit locking...
rcu is not implicit. At least in the only demo, which I have read
i.e. in routing cache, it is more explicit than spinlocks are. :-)
I also strongly dislike any kind of implicit serialization and even
not standard serialization. So, rcu used in route.c is supposed
to be cleaned of assembly style code and converted to something
more intelligible.
