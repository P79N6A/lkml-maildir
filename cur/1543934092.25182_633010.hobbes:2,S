Try disabling NCQ - see if you've got a drive with the 'NCQ = no
readahead' flaw.

Beats me - something is wrong that your setup triggers - could be
firmware funnies or Linux ones.

hdparm supports identify to read modes on drives with libata. The one
thing you cannot do is force modes right now.

Well for backup devices you can use the fact SATA is hot/warm plug.

NOTABUG - your BIOS has decided to move them from the legacy addresses so
they move from hda-d to e-g.
