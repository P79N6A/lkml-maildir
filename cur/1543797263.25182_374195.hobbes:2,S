If you look in the "init" configuration file, /etc/inittab, you'll
see lines similar to these:
1:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty1
2:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty2
3:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty3
4:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty4
5:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty5
6:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty6
Once "init" has finished bringing up the rest of the system, it will
execute the mingetty commands, asking mingetty to open the first 6 ttys.
This opening of each tty creates the virtual console, at which point
you can switch to it.
If you add:
7:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty7
8:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty8
then you'll have login prompts on ctrl-f1 to ctrl-f8, and X will be
on tty9 (ctrl-f9).
You could even ask another program to send its output to /dev/tty12,
which you'll be able to view via ctrl-f12 - eg, I do this with the
system logger on some of my systems.  At that point, you'll have
login prompts on tty1 to tty8, X on tty9 and something else on tty12.
(Note: you could comment out some of the mingetty lines in inittab,
but you should always leave at least one, in case something happens
with X and you need an alternative way to log in.)
