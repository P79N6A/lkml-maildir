Do you mean Linux should enable C1E on CPU 0 if it's detected on CPU 1?
C3 + dynticks make up a better power saver than simply C1E, as far as I
know. Higher C-states should be enabled on such CPUs, as AMD docs say
firmware should either enable C1E or C2 & C3 (it must provide one of
these mutually exclusive options). I take having C1E on the second CPU
but not the first as an attempt on BIOS's part to provide higher
C-states instead of the former. How broken is it, really?
But maybe someone with access to such hardware can tell us what
happens: does he get C2/C3 power states under such circumstances?
