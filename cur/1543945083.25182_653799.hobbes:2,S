That would require that the BIOS enumerates the CPUs in a way that
the cores of a socket are continuous. While that's usually true
I don't think there's a guarantee. In theory they could be all scattered.
Ok I theory Linux could remap later but that seems hardly worth 
the trouble.
I would rather just use arrays of integers in this case with a reasonable fixed 
upper limit (e.g. 16 or 32 -- if there are ever >32 thread x86 CPUs presumably they will
require an updated cpufreq driver too...)
