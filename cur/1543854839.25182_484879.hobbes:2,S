I checked the arch-independent sizing patches submitted related to x86_64 
and no line is changed that does anything with bootmap_size so that ruled 
out an obvious candidate. I did a diff on a grep for bootmap_size in 
arch/x86_64 and found that there is no difference in usage between 2.6.18 
and 2.6.19-rc6. Both call reserve_bootmem(bootmap, bootmap_size) which has 
changed. However, the changes seem to be more cosmetic than anything else 
using PFN_DOWN and PFN_UP instead of some_value/PAGE_SIZE so it's not 
super-clear where the warning is coming from.
