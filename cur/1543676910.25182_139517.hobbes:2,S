You are quite right.  I am an idiot.  I think the simplest way to fix
this is stop trying to overload the 'minor' argument to dm_create, and
instead have a seperate dm_create_with_minor function call.
ie.
int dm_create(struct dm_table *table, struct mapped_device **md);
int dm_create_with_minor(unsigned int minor, struct dm_table *table,
			 struct mapped_device **md);
I'm testing a patch for this now (with LVM this time, not just
dmsetup), and will post to the list in the next hour.
Sorry for the inconvenience,
- Joe
