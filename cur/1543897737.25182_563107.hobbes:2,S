Don't know, but I'd guess not.

Not that I know of.  Probably the straight #else conditional is OK.   
We should also merge up the types since *EVERY* linux architecture  
has these same types:
typedef   signed char      __s8;
typedef unsigned char      __u8;
typedef   signed short     __s16;
typedef unsigned short     __u16;
typedef   signed int       __s32;
typedef unsigned int       __u32;
Then all 64-bit archs have:
typedef   signed long      __s64;
typedef unsigned long      __u64;
While all 32-bit archs have:
typedef   signed long long __s64;
typedef unsigned long long __u64;
The only trick is if you care about building 32-bit compat code using  
64-bit linux kernel headers.  In that case we should probably just  
make all archs use "long long" for their 64-bit integers, unless  
there's some platform I'm not remembering where "long long" is 128- 
bits or bigger.  The other benefit is that people could then just use  
the printf format "%llu" for 64-bit integers instead of having to  
conditionalize it all over the place.
I'm working on a patch now.
Cheers,
Kyle Moffett
