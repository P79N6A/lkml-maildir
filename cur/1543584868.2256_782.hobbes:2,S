Hi again.  The latter half of my email seems to have been forgotten in
the ensuing discussion, so I'll repost.  For a linked list of any
non-floating point data, radix sort is almost impossible to beat; it's
iterative, fast (linear time for fixed size integers, worst case), can
be stopped early for partial sorting, and has a pretty simple
implementation.
I've been using essentially the same radix sort implementation I
posted before to sort 1000 item lists 60 times a second in a numerical
application, and it barely shows up in the total time used when
profiling.  The other sorts I tried did not fare so well.  I would
much rather see this in a kernel modification than any
merge/quick/heap sort implementations I've seen so far for linked
lists.  OTOH, this conversation seems to have wandered out of
kernel-space anyway...
