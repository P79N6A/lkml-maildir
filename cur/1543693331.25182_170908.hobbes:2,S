	Hi Andrew,
	Patch against 2.6.0-test6.
	Releases a previous request'ed_mem_region. Found by smatch.
	Since it didn't checked the return value of request_region, I'm not 
sure we should free it here...since (as it says on the driver), 
"vgacon probably has this region already".
	Andrew, I'd appreciate you could review this..
	Thanks.
Felipe
