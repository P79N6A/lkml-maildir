   And now, complains. First, you have bug out there causing module to
   hang around even after being unused.
This is a painful side effect of dentry caching in vfs.
Run some program which will just use most of your RAM, watch
afterwards how 'lsmod' output report that all remaining references to
the coda module have gone away, you may unload the module now.
Later,
