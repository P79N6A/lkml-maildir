I don't interface with any other files, so I prefer to have
everything in one file here. If there is anyone else who
agrees with you on moving this into a separate file, I don't
mind doing that.

There will be a supplement to Book 1-3 of PowerPC AS that is going to
be public. Book 4 is rarely needed and the chances of publishing that
are not as good.
