One way is to make a tracer_preempt_disable() and tracer_preempt_enable(),
both of which would be 'notrace'. You could probably optimize them
as well.  The standard preempt_disable and preempt_enable don't look
very efficient (e.g. what's up with converting an increment operation into
an addition? - gak!)
Any lock you do is going to have a pretty bad effect.
In order to be able to trace as much as possible, for KFT, I implemented
my own synchronization mechanism using cmpxchg, to avoid using any of the
existing kernel locks (which change more often than you'd think, and have
weird side effects).
