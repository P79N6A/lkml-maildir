Hi Keith,
excuse me, that I am not up to date concerning my information - but there is the
AMD-K6, the Cyrix M2, the IDT, the PA-RISC, the ..., the ... and for sure the xyz ...
processor (and so on ) rarely new.
For sure, I can learn everything about them, but when should I went to bed, ... no,
just kidding.
It was a suggestion of mine - I heard of some "problems" the PII may have, but
information about processor-types and their features is a lot of stuff.So far and
greetings, Dietmar
