This too, when ignoring clones and COW.

So this seems to be what adds all the complexity.

It gets messy quite quickly, yes.

I assume you meant "Not explicitly coding in", or else I'm tempted to disagree.
Abstraction that has only one user which uses it in one way only adds bloat.
But looking at the code a bit more I'm afraid you're right.
