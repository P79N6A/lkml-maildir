In fact all but the most kernel dependent programs should still
not be using these headers directly.
Given that glibc plays interesting tricks with dev_t and friends.
Only an application that knows what it is doing should bypass
glibcs abstraction layer.  
Mostly these headers will be there for glibc to include, and rexport
in sys/*
