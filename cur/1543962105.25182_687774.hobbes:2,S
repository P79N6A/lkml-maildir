Perhaps it would make sense to split the merge window into 2 - first
week kernel/net/mm/lib etc., second week arch/drivers/fs? Obviously
some changes are going to span those two areas but it might help in
pinpointing where breakage was introduced as well as quietening the
thundering herd of pull requests at the start of a merge window and
thereby allow review to happen over a longer period.
Or I could just be dreaming...
