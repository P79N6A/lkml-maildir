It does apply to slab allocations. The question is whether it has to apply
to every object allocation or to every page allocation of the slab
allocators.

Which have similar issues since memory policy application is depending on
a task policy and on memory migration that has been applied to an address
range.

Trimming through water marks and allocating memory from the page allocator
is going to be very frequent if you continually allocate on one processor
and free on another.
