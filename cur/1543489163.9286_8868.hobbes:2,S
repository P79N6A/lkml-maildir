This is way way way too low.

There are better ways. You could allocate memory for the link
traversal, even a single buffer and iterate, rewriting the path. You
don't need to traverse symlinks recursively.
8 used to be a common default, and that was pretty frustrating
sometimes. 5 is insanely low. 16 or 32 is much more reasonable. There
was discussion (comp.sys.unix? I forget) some years back about
alternatives (like real loop detection and non-linear methods which
used log2(n) instead of n space consumption) as this limit was really
in the (BSD) kernel to serve as a primitive loop detector, not as a
hack to preserve stack space.
Argh. Overuse of symlinks is certainly bad, but a chain limit of 5 is
mega-overly-conservative.
