It is not hard wired in the standard modutils, because there is no way
of overriding it.  If the kernel changes the way that binfmt_misc is
handled then users would be stuffed.
RedHat hard code binfmt_misc into their version of modutils but I won't
take the patch, users have to edit modules.conf themselves.
