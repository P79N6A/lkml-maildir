yeah.

yeah - i once lost a few hours of debugging to such an incident.

well, loglevel /can/ be managed by userspace, and sometimes an important 
kernel message might have a too high loglevel. Also, sometimes the 
kernel does spurious messages during hardware detect, etc., so userspace 
naturally wants to prevent them from going to the console. So it's 
really a mix of a problem and i wouldnt put the blame on user-space. 
User-space used the only control they have to fix the situation.
