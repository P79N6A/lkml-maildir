Thanks to personal coaching of Gabriel i bisected the last few days.
It looked like this was the cullprit:
22aadf8a07067644e101267ed5003043f2ad05bf is first bad commit
2.6.23-rc1-git[1-6] all lockup solid after either direct or
within a couple of minutes (less than 2) after reboot.
They all run fine with "acpi=off" as boot argument.
However, i'm currently running 2.6.23-rc1-git6 with this reverted:

I could hardly believe this could be the cause.
And indeed after about 16 minutes the kernel froze again, though longer
uptime than other kernels :-(
This hardware is a via epia 5000 with latest bios available (2.07)
It's remarkable that with acpi=off the machine is rocksolid.
As is with 2.6.22* kernels _with_ acpi enabled!
weeks of uptime before i wanted to upgrade to a new kernel ;-)
I'm thinking of redoing the git disect but this time really powercycle
the unit between kernels since it "seems/feels" like a timer which 
really counts to 0 and then locks the machine. 
After a lockup/freeze i cant boot the kernel another time with acpi 
enabled: it will simply hang after booting init.
And again nobody home: no keyboard activity whatsoever.
I've put the dmesg of 2.6.23-rc1-git6 with and without acpi=off online:
http://www.dth.net/kernel/via_output_2.6.23-rc1-git6-acpi_off
http://www.dth.net/kernel/via_output_2.6.23-rc1-git6-acpi_on
I would like to hear if someone has an idea how to tackle this problem.
Danny
