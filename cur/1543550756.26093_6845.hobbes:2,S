I have finally produced something resembling a formal definition of the
phase tree algorithm.  As you will see, this algorithm is somewhat
subtle, and not easy to express in clear simple terms.  But I think that
I have in fact expressed it clearly in simply.  If I have not, I wish
very much to be told so, and why.

Please, if you are especially anal and nasty and have little regard for
anyone's feelings, read this and complain about every little thing that
is wrong with it, and I will greatly appreciate that.  I will also
appreciate comments of the form 'you left out this or that', or 'this
part sounds like so much bafflegab' and so on.
Enjoy.
