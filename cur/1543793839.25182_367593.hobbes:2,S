So why not tell the fs to perform the "punch" before dealing with the page 
cache?  If you do it in that order, a racing read(2) (or a racing mmapped 
access for that matter) will see the hole, not the old data.
btw. I sometimes wonder whether it is correct for truncate to do the page 
cache update before calling down into the fs for simillar reasons but I 
think that it is ok after all because truncate only ever converts between 
(exists/hole -> does not exist) or (does not exist -> exists as 
zeroes/hole) but it never deals with (exists A -> exists B/hole) which is 
what sys_punchhole does.  I just had to adapt the address space operations 
readpage and writepage in ntfs to cope with a read/write request outside 
the end of the file which does happen when a racing truncate has extended 
the file's i_size but the fs has not done the necessary metadata updates 
yet...
Best regards,
