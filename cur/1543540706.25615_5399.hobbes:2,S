Subject: IPCHAINS and route hangs, unstable routing

I am using Red Hat Linux 6.2 (zoot) on i386.
I have three ne2000 ethernet cards, and have the computer 
configured as a firewall / NAT.  I setup the chain rules similiar to the
document "Securing and Optimizing Linux ..." found on the Guides 
page of www.linuxdoc.org.
It appears the third network card causes unstable routing issues.  
The masquarded computers behind the firewall can always see the 
internet, however the outside world can sometimes ping inside, and 
sometimes not.
I have noticed that when I have problems pinging or connecting to 
the SSH server (on the firewall) from the outsideIf, IPchains and 
route have problems as well.  When I list the ipchains "ipchains -L" 
it hangs at some point in the list.  The same for calling "route" it 
will stall part way through the list.
When I have no problems pinging or SSHing, then the same 
configuration will properly list all the IPchain rules and show the 
current route table.
It should be noted that I have input packets DENY by policy 
default, and specifically allow 1024:65535 plus access from the 
DNS server, and a few other key ports.  (I think ICMP are allowed 
back too).
Here is where it gets interesting.  If I reboot after it hangs, it will not 
allow trafic in remotely (but will still masquarade correctly).  If I 
flush all the chain rules, the route and ipchain list will work 
correctly.  Then If I recall the firewall rules (put all the chain rules 
back into place), sometimes it will work correctly (allow traffic in 
and out), and sometimes it will "hang"
Any suggestions?
