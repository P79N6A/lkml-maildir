Yes. I can happily mlockall 500 megs of ram when jackd is not running
and i do not get any preempt-timing reports.. As soon as jackd is
running even mlockall'ing only 20megs triggers a preempt-timing report
and also a alsa xrun report. Hmm, let me try turning off xrun_debug
traces while leaving preempt timing reports enabled... 
Ok, when xrun_debug traces are disabled [but preempt timing is on].
mlocking 20 megs of memory triggers an xrun [now only reported by jackd
in it's stdout, not in syslog] but not a preempt timing report. Lee, can
you verify? 
So it seems that the xrun_debug reports from the alsa interface jackd is
using triggers the preempt timing reports. So these are really
suspicious...
So i'm asking myself: How can jackd experience an xrun, when there's no
preempt-timing report showing a kernel latency. Jackd is running
SCHED_FIFO, so the mlockall_test program should not take away the cpu
from jackd. Is mlockall() special in another way? Sorry, i know too
little about the kernel internals to ask the right question. Maybe the
alsa driver is reacting to the mlockall_test..
Another piece of info which might be valuable (i cannot judge this): I
use jackd and mlockall not as root, but as normal user utilizing the
realtime lsm which allows non root users to mlock, mlockall  and change
the scheduling class (via sched_setsched()?). I'll try runnign jackd and
the mlockall_test as root to see if the results differ..

Sorry, i don't understand that question..
