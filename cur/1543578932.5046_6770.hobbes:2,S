Check out arch/sparc64/kernel/sys_sparc32.c. Dave and I fixed this a while
ago. In particular look at the arch specific SPARC_FLAG_MMAPSHARED flag.

sysv shared mem when you specify an attach address should work fine (ie
aligned to SHMLBA). On the other hand sysv shared mem without requesting
an address is broken and I havent got around to fixing it yet.

See above.
