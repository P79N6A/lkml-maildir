Hi Jurgen,
I haven't seen this particular error before, and I can't say for sure
whether it's a genuine problem that should be dealt with or just a
minor annoyance that can be safely ignored.  EDAC is a relatively new
piece of code, and still very much a work in progress.  If this is in
fact a benign type of error, EDAC should provide a mechanism by which
a sysadmin can silence it.  This is an area of future work.
I'm forwarding your message to the bluesmoke mailing list just in
case anyone who reads that list has seen instances of this error in
the past and can provide more info on it.
Dave
