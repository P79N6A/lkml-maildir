I expect most people would prefer read-only CVS for keeping up to date.
However, rsync from the repository is generally _much_ faster than CVS
if you are tracking changes, so I (an impatient modem user) prefer rsync.
Also the SCCS repository is more fun for analysis and browsing
programs than a CVS equivalent because some of the metadata would be
lost converting to CVS.
So I vote for rsync read-only access to the actual SCCS-ish repository
files that BK manages.
Ideally you'd ensure the tree offered through rsync was a consistent
snapshot, offer a method of atomically updating the tree seen by rsync
is a consistent snapshot.  (Although this isn't crucial; BK's
changeset files let you detect that at the client I believe).
