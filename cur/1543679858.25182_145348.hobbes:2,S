The way i see it is that you can't use NR_CPUS to determine the upper 
bound on APIC IDs. e.g. my 3way is normally configured with NR_CPUS = 3 
but has APIC IDs of 0, 3 and 4. We need to make a distinction.

Well we really want APIC_MAX_ID (or whatever it's called)

No, the problem is no space for physical ids in cpumask bitmaps, this 
could manifest itself later on unless we fix it now.

That one is slightly worrying, yes.

Urgh, it's really hard to determine what these functions really want half 
the time. But that change does look wrong.
