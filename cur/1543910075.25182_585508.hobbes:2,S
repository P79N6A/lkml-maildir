Hi All,
Recently, I got a funny problem that my NFS client can't show some of 
mounted directories. These directories that can't be showed by "ls" 
command have great deals of files.
For example. I have a directory on NFS server log and there are 69 
files. I can't show it's child files through NFS.
---On NFS server---
bash-2.05b# ls
1   13  17  20  24  28  31  35  39  42  46  5   53  57  60  64  68  9
10  14  18  21  25  29  32  36  4   43  47  50  54  58  61  65  69
11  15  19  22  26  3   33  37  40  44  48  51  55  59  62  66  7
12  16  2   23  27  30  34  38  41  45  49  52  56  6   63  67  8
---On NFS client---
# ls
#
After I delete one file from NFS server side, everything becomes OK.
---On NFS server---
bash-2.05b# rm 69
bash-2.05b# ls
1   13  17  20  24  28  31  35  39  42  46  5   53  57  60  64  68
10  14  18  21  25  29  32  36  4   43  47  50  54  58  61  65  7
11  15  19  22  26  3   33  37  40  44  48  51  55  59  62  66  8
12  16  2   23  27  30  34  38  41  45  49  52  56  6   63  67  9

I also scrapped the packets through ethereal and saw that packet sent at 
case 1) isn't valid. It only has 3 fileds: ., .. and last. I suppose the 
problem came from NFS server side because we can't received valid NFS 
packet for such directories with plenty of files. Anybody knew what's 
the root cause?
Thanks,
Gavin
