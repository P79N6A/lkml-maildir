Hello All,
    Just noticed that mke2fs runs slower under 2.3.7 than it does under
2.2.9.  Not by a tremendous amount (16 vs 18 seconds), but I thought
someone might be interested.  There is also a noticable difference in
how mke2fs spends its time.  At the beginning of mke2fs when the inode
table is being written, 2.2.9 writes at a constant speed whereas 2.3.7
seems to write in bursts.
    The machine is a 133MHz cyrix with 64M of memory and IDE drives.  The
partition is ~1G.
Thanks,
Jim
