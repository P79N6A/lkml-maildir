Hi, I had similar problem, took me months to figure it out.
I suggest:
* getting latest binutils, compiling and installing them
* thorougly checking that *old* binutils aren't interfering
  (in my case ksymoops got linked with old libbfd.a despite
  newer one was also installed! 8-[ )
* compiling ksymoops
