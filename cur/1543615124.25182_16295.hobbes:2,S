It didn't make an iota of difference what sizes I played with
(and I tried quite a few different ones)
I've come up with a preload_cache() function (for want of a better name)
and plonked that in prefetch.h for now. Having this #define to nothing
on other arch's would mean we could use this in places like we currently
do prefetch().  I'm still not happy with it, but its cleaner than my
original hack.
It's in -dj10 for the curious.
Dave.
