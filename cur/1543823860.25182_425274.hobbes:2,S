No, since pit is a lower-priority clock source than tsc, pmtmr, or hpet,
and most systems can use one of the latter.  However, we currently
recommend clock=pit to VMware users because clock=tsc and clock=pmtmr
have bugs in their lost-tick compensation that makes them actually gain
extra time, and those bugs get tickled often in a VM, making the time
gain quite bad.  (See 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5127.
)
So it would be nice for us if clock=pit didn't go backward, but most
people wouldn't care.

That would be great.  I'm much more excited about seeing John's rework
go in than this little patch of mine.  I only sent out this patch
because John said he wasn't sure how soon his rework would get in.
> John, do those patches address this bug?
I can answer that.  Yes -- John's patch had a similar bug, but I sent
him a similar fix for it and he has merged it in his version C2. 
(However, the issues that Roman and I are discussing apply there too, so
more work may still be needed to make pit a good clocksource, and maybe
it can be good only on UP systems...)

It makes perfect sense to me and sounds like the right thing to do.  Thanks!
