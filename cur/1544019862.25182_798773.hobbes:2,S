No, not really.  Accesses to the last few sectors will be slightly 
slower, but those sectors don't get used much anyway and the slowdown 
isn't very big.  In theory there might be a device which doesn't like 
single-sector accesses near the end... but what can you do about 
something like that?  If the device doesn't let you read sectors one at 
a time, it's not worth worrying about.

Maybe.  I don't know any of the details.
