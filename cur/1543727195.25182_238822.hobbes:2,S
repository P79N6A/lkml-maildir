Please don't typecast void*'s in this manner: if someone were to change the
type of subch_data, this typecast would cause the useful warning to be
suppressed.

Why wake_up_all()?  I think wake_up() is the appropriate function here?

hmm, if a signal is pending, scdrv_write() will return with the sd->sd_wbs
semaphore still held.  Dead driver, yes?
