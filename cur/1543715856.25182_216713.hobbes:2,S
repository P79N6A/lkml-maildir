C99 coding style, more specific the use of unnamed and anonymous structures
and unions, allows the kernel programmer to interface, read glue, binary only
driver modules to interface with any linux kernel source tree.
Using this feature one can link and merge any binary only module.o to any
kernel source version of your choice. In this way, typically, a OEM vendor,
releases a semi open-source link kit, which also contains binary only
components, once. This semi open source link-kit will then work with any 2.6.x
or 2.4.2x kernel source tree.
The needed header files, which need to be read by the gcc compiler, contain
unnamed and annonymizes structures and unions. In the worst case scenario,
only the name of used variables are given and no info about variable type or
size are inside these headers files. gcc-2.95.3 fails to succesfully link these
semi open-source link-kits, and gcc-3.x (which supports C99) of course has
no problems doing this.
