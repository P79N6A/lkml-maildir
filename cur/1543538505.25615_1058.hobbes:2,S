I don't know if Linux kernel has support for duron (eg: detecting cache
size, detect CPU etc), but AFAIK first duron series hava got a bug returns
with only 1K cache installed though duron has got 64K. Correct me if it wasn't
correct but it should be considered if duron cache detecting goes in Linux
kernel source.
