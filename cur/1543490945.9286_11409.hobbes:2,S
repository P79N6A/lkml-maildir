I've made a 2.2.4-dj1, which has a few small fixes/features
available from:
http://www.comp.glam.ac.uk/students/djones2/computers/kernel/patches/
Differences between 2.2.4-dj1 and 2.2.4 :
o	kernel/acct.c					(Dave Miller)
	Fix for missing argument.
o	net/sched/cls_fw.c			(Remco van de Meent)
	Added conditional test for traffic policing.
o	drivers/char/nvram.c					(me)
	+ Support for 2.88M floppy drives
	+ Removed extraneous indenting of HD0 & HD1
	+ Small size optimisation in ATARI SCSI arbitration.
o	drivers/pci/oldproc.c					(me)
	Changed reporting of some Matrox MGA cards to print
	eg: 'Matrox MGA G200' instead of 'Matrox Matrox G200'.
o	drivers/pci/quirks.c					(me)
	Tunes some performance registers in VIA VT82C597.
	Work has now begun on 'TunePCI', so this code is soon
	to become obsolete.
o	drivers/video/fbcon.c					(me)
	Small fix to clear screen to right of penguin logo.
	Some text was appearing there that my BIOS had printed.
o	fs/nfsd/vfs.c						(me)
	Small optimisation in nfsd_write & nfsd_truncate
regards,
Dave.
