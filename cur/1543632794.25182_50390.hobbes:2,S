Not much info as I don't have the hardware here to reproduce your 
config. From your e-mail address I assume you're developing Linux 
drivers for your network cards or debugging a problem with existing ones.
I took the liberty of forwarding your e-mail to the linux-kernel mailing 
list. If this problem is known there are chances one subscriber is aware 
of it (there are SiS people around here).
LB.
