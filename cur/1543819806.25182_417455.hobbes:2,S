It seems that ipt_owner does _not_ support PID match anymore:
In /usr/src/linux/net/ipv4/netfilter/ipt_owner.c:
...
if (info->match & (IPT_OWNER_PID|IPT_OWNER_SID|IPT_OWNER_COMM)) {
        printk("ipt_owner: pid, sid and command matching "
               "not supported anymore\n");
        return 0;
}
...
My main objective simply works on single-processor machine, I haven't
intend to do it on SMP one.
Mikado.
