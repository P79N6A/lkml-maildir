The thing is, your sysrq-P output clearly shows that it's all in wine, and 
I'd be very surprised if this is not a codeweavers/wine bug. The pipe poll 
code is literally a couple of lines long, and it's hard to introduce a bug 
there. Especially a transient bug that goes away.
However, I don't understand how wine can block the X server from doing 
even cursor updates. It might be a scheduler bug, of course. The one thing 
a bigger pipe buffer does is end up changing scheduling behaviour. 
(On the other hand, I would not be surprised if Wine does something that 
makes X pause, like use DGA or whatever and tells X not to update the 
screen, including cursors).

pipe_poll shouldn't get confused, but apps certainly could. If an app 
"knows" that a pipe read can only return 4kB of data, it would obviously 
get confused when that's no longer true.

Are you sure your oprofile PC map is correct?
