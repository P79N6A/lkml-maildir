I have written a module which takes the packet from the kernel, stores some
number of packets and then sends all if them out. But some how the kernel
crashes after working for some time. how can i take care of that. the
enqueing and dequeing functions take action on the same piece of memory.
will using task queues for both of them work ?
I have tried doin it...but even then the kernel konks.:-(
