I would have thought so too, but it also appears to consistently reduce
time spent in the kernel. This seems to imply that the performance
improves for the first task watcher that gets added. I'd randomly guess
there's a branch misprediction when no watchers are registered.
My latest results will be more rigorous in that they show what a pure
2.6.18-mm1 run looks like. I've also removed the benchmark patch from
the series of runs. Unfortunately it takes approximately 24 hours to run
so it'll be a little while before I have the numbers.

Nope, sorry. I'll see what I can put together.
