So you mean something like this:
void devfs_per_cpu_register (const char *leafname, unsigned int flags,
			     unsigned int major, unsigned int minor_start,
			     umode_t mode, void *ops);
void devfs_per_cpu_unregister (const char *leafname);
with code in the per-cpu boot code to create the /dev/cpu/%d
directories.
