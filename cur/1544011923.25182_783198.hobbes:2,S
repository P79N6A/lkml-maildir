OK, I see that.

We've checked the mmc_core as follows, that's way we thought in that way before.
        brq.data.sg = mq->sg;
        brq.data.sg_len = mmc_queue_map_sg(mq);
        mmc_queue_bounce_pre(mq);
        if (brq.data.blocks !=
            (req->nr_sectors >> (md->block_bits - 9))) {
            data_size = brq.data.blocks * brq.data.blksz;
            for (sg_pos = 0; sg_pos < brq.data.sg_len; sg_pos++) {
                data_size -= mq->sg[sg_pos].length;
                if (data_size <= 0) {
                    mq->sg[sg_pos].length += data_size;
                    sg_pos++;
                    break;
                }
            }
            brq.data.sg_len = sg_pos;
        }
       mmc_wait_for_req(card->host, &brq.mrq);
       mmc_queue_bounce_post(mq);
Also, we are trying to use the dma_map_single()/dma_unmap_single() functions. We think it's easiler to implement.

We're checking and hope to provide a significant way for this in next patch.
