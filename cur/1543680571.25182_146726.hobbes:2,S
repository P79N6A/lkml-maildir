Umm, no.  You misunderstood.
There's two quota _ondisk_ formats:
v1 old 16bit quota.
v2 new 32bit quota.
2.4 previously only supported v1, 2.5 and 2.4.22-pre4 also support v2.
There's three sys_quotactl ABIs
1) original 16 bit one, supported by all kernels <= 2.4
2) first 32bit one, supported by 2.4-ac any many vendor trees, but never
   in mainline
3) new 32bit one, supported by 2.4.x (x >= 22-pre4) and 2.5
Unfortunately the second one uses the same constants as the old 16bit one
but different structures so there is no way to support both in a single
kernel.
