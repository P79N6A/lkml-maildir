The semaphore location exists in the memory map structure, mm_struct.
You only need to allocate some memory the size of that structure to
contain the semaphore. You can readily see what happens in
../kernel/fork.c ...:
    Something like:
          if((current->mm = mm_alloc()) == NULL)
              printk("Some problem with mm_alloc()\n");
          else
              init_rwsem(&current->mm->mmap_sem);
   ... should get you going.
    If, in all your code, the only problem you had was an allocation
problem with your semaphore, and not a problem with actual memory
access, then you are golden. If you are even going to shut down your
kernel thread, you probably need to add your allocation to the
linked list. If not, don't bother.
