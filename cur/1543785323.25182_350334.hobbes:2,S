Actually, that's not true. I was asking people what scripts they use the 
other day, and was surprised to learn that they don't use any at all.
And especially if you use git itself - _without_ any special scripts, the
git mailing list is actually active and quite helpful. I haven't seen you 
ask anything there.. Hint hint..

Now _that_ is true. You can't depend on vendor packaging. They are _way_ 
too slow. For now, you absolutely have to do it yourself.
(Well, "absolutely have to" may not be true - you can find RPM's etc, but 
you might as well resign yourself to it for the next few months).
Just do this: 
 - get the last daily snapshot from 
	
http://www.codemonkey.org.uk/projects/git-snapshots/git/
   (this is mentioned in the overview, btw, directly reachable from 
   www.kernel.org/git, so it's even well documented)
 - compile and install it: "make" + "make install"
 - just as an exercise (and because it's a lot smaller than the kernel 
   and thus downloads much faster), get the git.git tree:
	git clone rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git git-tree
	cd git-tree
	git checkout
	make
	make install
   and you've now gotten the most up-to-date git there is. The nice thing 
   about this is that going an update is now
	git pull origin
   so you can trivially keep track of it forever after.
 - now you're getting ready to get a _real_ project. This will take some 
   time.
	git clone \
		rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git \
		kernel-tree
	cd kernel-tree
	git checkout
   and you have the kernel sources. On my 1.5Mbps DSL line, it takes about
   ten minutes, because you're downloading about 80MB of stuff (and 
   the checkout unpacks 17,000 files and takes 5 seconds for me, but a 
   _lot_ more if you don't have tons of memory to cache the thing).  But
   it's not horrible.
 - play around.
And git really isn't that hard to use any more. If you tried it two months 
ago, it was a _lot_ more complicated. These days, if you can work with 
CVS, it's a hell of a lot more pleasant than that ;)
(It doesn't have a really nice graphical merge tool like BK did, for 
example: you end up having to resolve merge clashes the CVS way by 
searching for "<<<<<"/"======"/">>>>>>" markers.. The good news is that 
it gets merge clashes pretty infrequently - I get them maybe once a week, 
and I merge a _lot_)
