I now understand that you need a way to distinguish between something
like
shoe/size
and
shoe/.../size   (or shoe/..size)
The first one is the size of the shoe, the second is the automatically
generated size of the file (object). You would get into trouble if you
would not allow the user to use shoe/size for shoe size. Peter
