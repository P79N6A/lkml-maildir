Hi Ron,
This looks like a simple parallelism bug with "make dep" and
CONFIG_MODVERSIONS.  When you run "make dep" with parallel mkdep's,
all of them are updating include/linux/modversions.h simultaneously.
This is a subtle and easy-to-make Makefile mistake: having something
in a Makefile which modifies a global state file outside of the
current directory.  Multiple "-j" invocations race for the state file.

Good report.  As Alan Cox says, a lot of bugs manifest in a "distributed"
fashion so more specimens are always welcome, even if no one can fix
them right now.
