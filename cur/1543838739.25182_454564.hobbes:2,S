Difficult... but maybe. One of the main idea is that the 3 values used
for "calibration" (pre-mult offset, multiplier and post-mult offset) are
in a structure. There is an array of 2 of these and a pointer to the
"current" one. When changing those values, we update the "other" one,
wmb, then flip the pointer. The readers can then mostly be barrier-less
since there is a natural data dependency on the pointer.
Ben.
