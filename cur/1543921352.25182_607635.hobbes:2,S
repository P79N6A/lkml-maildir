Hi,
Thanks a lot.
I fix the order of calls in dmfe.c
and in saa7134-core.c.
I probably need to add this synchronize_irq() logic in dmfe.c too, but I probably do it later,
I think I am overestimating this race, since most drivers don't do dev->insuspend checks in IRQ handler.
Maybe even just use free_irq() after all....
