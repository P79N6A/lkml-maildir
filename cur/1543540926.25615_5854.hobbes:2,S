Subject: Can't get sysrq working in 2.2.12 kernel

I can't get sysrq working in the 2.2.12 kernel.
I've established that handle_sysrq is not being called from handle_scancode 
in keyboard.c because sysrq_enabled is 0.  Given that it's initialised to 1 
in sysrq.c, something is obviously changing it.
The only place I've found that could change it is via kern_tble in 
sysctl.c, though I haven't done an extensive search.  I admit to not 
spending the time to work out what the code in there is all about.
Can anyone tell me what or why that variable might be being zeroed?  I can 
only gather I'm doing something wrong, but I can't find anything in 
sysrq.txt or in the archives on the web.
Thanks,
Dave
