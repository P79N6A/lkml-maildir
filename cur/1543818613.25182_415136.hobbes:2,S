I thought more of introducing functions, which just fold away 
all the "if ()" blocks in normal code paths, 
which you wrapped into "#if" here. 
I don't think people have problems, if you #ifdef out complete functions,
linear setup code or structure members. People seem to have more problems
with #ifdef in control flow code, because there the condition is nothing else but
a compile time constant (the CONFIG_FOO value) which should be expressed as such.
Instead of 
#ifdef CONFIG_FOO
if (condition) {
}
#endif
just do
#ifdef CONFIG_FOO
#define foo 1
#else
#define foo 0
#endif
if  (foo && condition) {
}
Just do nothing or return a compile time constant in those inlines.

No problem, just optimize out the assignment itself:
#if defined(CONFIG_VLAN_8021Q) || defined(CONFIG_VLAN_8021Q_MODULE)
static inline void typhoon_setup_vlan_hooks(struct netdev *dev) {
         dev->vlan_rx_register = typhoon_vlan_rx_register;
         dev->vlan_rx_kill_vid = typhoon_vlan_rx_kill_vid;
}
#else
static inline void typhoon_setup_vlan_hooks(struct netdev *dev) { (void)dev; }
#endif
The whole linux/if_vlan.h stuff misses this style of code.
There is simply no fallback code for CONFIG_VLAN_8021Q not being defined.
