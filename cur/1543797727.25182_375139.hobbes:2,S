OK, yeah if a thread in the parent process writes into the buffer, then
yes this would leave the copy in the parent AFAIKS.
But this is going to do similar weird stuff when racing with copy_to_user
with ethernet recvmsg, is it not? (and direct-io and probably others). As
such, I don't think it would be something you in particular need to worry
about.
I guess to solve it, we could either retain mmap_sem for the duration to
prevent fork, or try to do something tricky with page_count to determine
if we need to do a copy in fork() rather than a COW.
