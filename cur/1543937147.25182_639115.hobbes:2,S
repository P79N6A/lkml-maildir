no. The problem is that PAGE_MASK is:
  #define PAGE_MASK        (~(PAGE_SIZE-1))
  #define PAGE_SIZE        (_AC(1,UL) << PAGE_SHIFT)
that's u32 on PAE, and __PHYSICAL_MASK is u64. So PAGE_MASK gets 
zero-extended to u64. So the combined mask:
  #define PHYSICAL_PAGE_MASK      (PAGE_MASK & __PHYSICAL_MASK)
has the high bits chopped off. Please try my patch.
(PHYSICAL_PAGE_MASK is broken too in the same way, i just fixed that in 
my tree - but it's not used by anything on 32-bit PAE but by PAGE_MASK)

try it ...
