i mentioned that patch in earlier emails, and it is a whole different
thing. The patch built a completely new bitmap *every* time we hit an
already allocated PID, to find the next 'safe range'. The new PID
allocator in 2.5.37 keeps one bitmap and does a single set-bit map
operation in the fastpath and does a fast bitscan forward even in the
worst case.
