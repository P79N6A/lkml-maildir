Yeah, Sun wasn't really good about committing people to fix things that
it needed, they just like to find things they need.

True, and a fair answer.

Well, this API is not far from "good enough".  It's meant to be a "simple
event system" but with a few expansions, it can be a full-featured event
system :)  And yes, I know the term "feature creep".

So what if the actual event system had a payload, and simple events don't
use it, and complex events do?  Or what if there were an exactly analogous
API for messages with payloads?

What's insane about a string payload?  Or rather, what are your objections
to saying that the payload string format is entirely dependant on the
{source, event} tuple?
ACPI events might come out of a kobject "/sys/devices/acpi" with an event
"event" and payload "button/power 00000000 00000001" or whatever the
actual values work out to be.
What's insane about that?  Currently we have a separate /proc/acpi/event
file which spits out "button/power 00000000 00000001".

But semantically, it's the same as this new API (I think), just less
elegant.

Yes, the payload is the big thing (that I see).  I'm not sure if you're
posing this as in "See, it needs a payload so we don't want it." or "If we
find a way to do a payload sanely, will you shut up?".
:)
