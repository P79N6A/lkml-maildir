 (the client, aka 'initiator').
A follow up question - I recently used nbd to access a CD-ROM. It worked 
nice, but, I had to read in 7 CDs, so, each time I had to replace a CD, I 
had to stop the client, the server, then replace the CD, re-start the 
server, re-start the client... I thought about extending NBD to (better) 
support removable media, but then you start thinking about all those 
features that your local block device has that don't get exported over 
NBD...
Now, my understanding (sorry, without looking at any docs - yet) is, that 
iSCSI is (or at least should be) free from these limitations. So, does it 
make any sense at all extending NBD or just switch to iSCSI? Should NBD be 
just kept simple as it is or would it be completely superseeded by iSCSI, 
or is there still something that NBD does that iSCSI wouldn't (easily) do?
Or am I completely misunderstanding what iSCSI target does?
Thanks
Guennadi
