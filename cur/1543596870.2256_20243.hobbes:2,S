Really?

Ah, so it is... yes, making this architecture dependant might be a
good idea. Large PPC and MIPS boxen need to adjust this already. Also,
someone did a starfire port, I think that had 64 processors, not sure.
    You can.  But you cannot buy 32-processor PII (-Xeon) systems that are
    supported by Linux.
What is the limit here? The 8/16 way SE chipsets?

    It doesn't.
Oh, then they definately need to send me one.
Are these not MP1.4 based? Something different?
