    The 2.4 support has been available since April of 2002:
    
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/aeb
    It was announced on the kernel mailing list, and doesn't seem to have
    gotten any negative feedback, but it never became part of the kernel.
    It appears to work, and many people say it works.
    Apparently, this patch to support SDDR09 write capability was never
    submitted.  Are there any plans to do so?
I just fetched this patch again, rediffed against 2.4.21-pre5
booted and verified that I could write a file. This version
lives in .../kernel/people/aeb/sddr09-driver-for-2.4.21pre5 .
Greg, Matt: probably this driver was never submitted. Let me do it now.
