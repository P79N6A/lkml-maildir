Does the notion of a generic ACL interface in the VFS layer bother
anyone else?
ACLs are nice and everything, and when you need them, there is no
substitute.
But on all of our machines, the vast majority of files need only the
simple, traditional access control mechanisms.  Indeed, ACLs for them
would be a security headache.
I've heard that Sun and HP both have security issues because of the
increased complexity in their file systems.
So my question is:
Do the benefits of a generic ACL interface in the VFS layer (should
any exist) justify the increased complexity in the kernel and the
poential increase complexity of secure operation?
Thanks.

p.s.
Before you answer (should anyone decide to):
1 - I recognize that no one suggested ACLs for everything.
2 - I recognize that above I said, "on all of our machines", a
    somewhat limited sample size.
3 - I recognize that I have no hard data to support my claims about
    Sun and HP ACL security trouble.  I've only heard of difficulties.
