Yes.

These are both part of the same larger solution, which is to
partition domains. isolated CPUs are just the case of 1 CPU in
its own domain (and that's how they are implemented now).
So we need the interface or some driver to do this partitioning.

But we simply can't make a partition for them because they have asked
to use all CPUs. We can't know if this is something that should be
partitioned or not, can we?

In the sense that they get what they ask for, yes. The obvious route
for the big SGI systems is to put them in the right cpuset. The job
managers (or admins) on those things are surely up to the task.
This leaves unbound and transient kernel threads like pdflush as a
remaining problem. Not quite sure what to do about that yet. I see
you have a little hack in there...

But your knob is just going to be some mechanism to say that you don't
care about such and such a task, or you want to put task x into domain
y.

I think this is much more of an automatic behind your back thing. If
they don't want any load balancing to happen, they could pin the tasks
in that cpuset to the cpu they're currently on, for example.
It would be trivial to make such a script to parse the root cpuset and
do exactly this, wouldn't it?
