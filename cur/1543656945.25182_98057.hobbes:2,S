I originally had the problem with 2.4.18 and only updated to 2.4.20-ac2 hoping
it would solve the problem. It doesn't look like the same issue as yours.
When your process is blocked, what wait channel does ps -elf list for it?
What system call does strace -T show it executing and for how long?
I wonder what else is on the ide channels, perhaps if I move things around so
it's the only device on that channel it would help?
