There's a DoS attack going around on the net: this particular attack
focuses on IDENT (port 113) and leaves sockets in CLOSE_WAIT state. 
Here's an example (from netstat -ntu)
tcp  34  0  194.222.9.116:113  204.60.30.67:1386  CLOSE_WAIT  
Seems if there's data in the queue, the socket will never close. 
This is on 2.2.6. 
Someone else reported the same thing with 2.2.5, he had a socket in
CLOSE_WAIT over 7 days! 
Cheers, 
Alex
