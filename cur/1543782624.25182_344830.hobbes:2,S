Working on that now - I'll let you know.

Yes, in our database system the child will immediately touch some shmem 
pages, and may eventually touch most of them (and would almost never 
exec()).  Fork performance is critical in usage scenarios where an 
end-user database request forks a new server process from one master 
server process.
However, there is still a need that the child, once successfully forked, 
is operational reasonably quickly.  I suspect that Ross's idea of paging 
in everything after the first fault would not be optimal for us, because 
we'd still be talking about hundreds of ms of work done before the child 
does anything useful.  It would still be far better than the behavior we 
have today because that time would no longer be synchronous with the 
fork().  Of course, it sounds like our app might be able to make use of 
the hugetlb stuff can mitigate this problem in the future...
