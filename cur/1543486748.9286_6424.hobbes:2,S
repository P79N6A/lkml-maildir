How does one setup IP accounting w/ IPChains?  I've searched the list,
and I can see how to spit back packet/byte counters, but is there a
package or a script somewhere that someone has written that can make
these things useful?  Any insight is greatly apperciated.
PS- if you would please address the message to me and CC the list, that
way I can get your message faster.
