Hi,
  today I have to change IP number of one of my diskless (it is diskless
since monday when IDE disk died...) and I changed boot commandline
from IP 147.32.240.3 to 147.32.240.80. Unfortunately, I forgot to change
this value in initscripts, so Debian init invoked ifconfig eth0 147.32.240.3.
After this, networking died and I got oops with
BUG() in filemap.c:1406 message :-(
  Yes, that was pilot error, but I think that first error in nfs readpage()
can cause this. I have no clue what's wrong (as usual).
  And one another question - I had to switch my (knfs) server from
2.3.11-pre5 to 2.2.11-alan-proposed-2, because of I was getting ext2
corruptions (it worked for at least week without started knfsd without
problems, same kernel after insmod knfsd+running client (writting 4MB of
data (with random seeks) once every 4 minutes) died while compiling new
kernel (I was going to compile pre6 at that time)):
ext2_readdir: bad entry in directory #86095: rec_len % 4 != 0 - offset=0, (*)
   inode=3064714009, rec_len=50531, name_len=165
or
ext2_free_blocks: Freeing blocks not in datazonme - block = 774971392, count = 1
ext2_free_blocks: bit already cleared for block 3044457
or
files accessed while accessing server from client were damaged (filled
with 4KB chunks of zeroes).
  Last one was probably caused by lazy_tlb bugs in pre5, for first two
I'm not sure. Because of I'm leaving Prague for one week today, I cannot
(I do not want...) test real 2.3.11 as server :-(
                                                Best regards,
                                                    Petr Vandrovec
                                                    vandrove@vc.cvut.cz
(*) When this happened, /tftpboot/147.32.240.3/etc/terminfo directory
entry disappeared on server :-( Directory itself (with subdirectories) was
moved to lost+found by fsck. Client was doing read-only accesses to this
directory at that time (ncurses app startup); I do not think that it did
rw accesses at that time.
P.S.: /etc/exports:
