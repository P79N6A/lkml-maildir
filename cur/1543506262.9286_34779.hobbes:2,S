If you're after that, I can give you a starting point. I have my
procmail set up to filter the linux-kernel mailing list items into a
separate folder, and I read every mail therein, deleting any spam like
those, along with any subscribe/unsubscribe emails that get there, and
any empty messages. When the result tops 1,000 mails, I move the said
folder and start a new one.
I can supply the results of that going back to 10th June 1999 as a
starting point for anybody who's interested, all in pine folder
format, and then bzip2'd, about 10 Megs compressed at the moment...
Best wishes from Riley.
