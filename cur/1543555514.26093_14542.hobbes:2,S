* your macro fails for the 'ANY' case, because the proper macro is
PCI_ANY_ID not PCI_{VENDOR,DEVICE}_ID_ANY.
* many drivers need to set the driver_data field
That said, the general idea presented above is quite good.  The PCITBL
macro will probably change on a per-driver basis... I don't think it
belongs in a common header.  For example, ethernet drivers might want to
have a macro that always checks for PCI-CLASS-ETHERNET under the hood,
while visibly looking like
PCITBL(INTEL, 82437VX, {a driver_data value}),
PCITBL(INTEL, 82987VX, {another driver_data value}),
PCITBL_END
