Subject: Integrated MCA SCSI controller support in 2.2.x

I was wondering what the current status of MCA support in 2.2.x is.  I have
just tried 2.2.4 with this IBM PS/2 Model 56 I have here, and noticed that
the Integrated SCSI controller driver still does not work.  So far I've got
it to work using 2.0.35 dropping in two files, "ibmmca.c.lang" and
"ibmmca.h.lang" from the glycerine.itsmm.uni.edu(sp?) ftp site.  Of all
kernels I had built, that was the only one that worked--however, the ethernet
card driver appears to not be working correctly for the 3c523 card (it _does_
detect it, though).  For this reason I was considering 2.2.x kernels.
Any of the MCA developers able to reply to this post?  I'd also be willing
to test any 2.2.x patches out.  I compile these kernels on a P166MMX machine
(my main machine, PCI/ISA-based) so compiling shouldn't be any trouble.
Note that I am not subscribed to the kernel list--please reply straight
to this email address or any of the ones in my signature.
Thanks
