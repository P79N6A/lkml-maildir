   I don't see why it wouldn't be desirable to have a method of stopping the
   driver from continuing to call vlan_hwaccel_rx, so that the vlan_group could
   be freed after all the VIDs were removed.  It could be as simple as
   declaring that dev->vlan_rx_register(dev, NULL) is valid.
This is how I intended it to be used.  It isn't done now only because
this event does not occur within the VLAN layer :)
