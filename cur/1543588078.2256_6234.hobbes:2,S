Then tell me, how exactly DO you plan to do write clustering
of inodes when you want to flush them to disk ?
If you don't keep them in the buffer cache for a while (or in
the page cache, for that matter), there's no way you can get
efficient IO clustering done...
Also, the buffer cache referenced bit will be extremely useful
for things like indirect blocks, etc...

Rik
