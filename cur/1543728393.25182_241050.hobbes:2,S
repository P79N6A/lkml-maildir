Not only is your machine floppy drive-less, but the driver thinks you
don't even have a floppy *controller*, which I assume is separate
from the actual drive.
What mainboard do you have?  Does it boot without "pci=routeirq"
if you turn CONFIG_BLK_DEV_FD off?
The code in the floppy_init() -> user_reset_fdc() -> WAIT() ->
wait_til_done() -> reset_fdc() path looks pretty scary if there
really is no controller out there.  I'd feel much better if
we at least tried to use ACPI to figure out whether we have
a controller before we try to talk to it.
All that aside, I still don't see how the pci=routeirq change
would affect the floppy driver.  It does request_irq(6, ...),
and it is interesting that you have this:
    ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [LNKD] enabled at IRQ 6
    ACPI: PCI interrupt 0000:00:04.0[A] -> GSI 6 (level, low) -> IRQ 6
which is for your NIC.  But the floppy controller isn't a PCI
device, so the LNKD enable shouldn't matter to it.
Let's see... you're using the PIC model.  Maybe the floppy driver
depends on the ACPI_IRQ_MODEL_PIC stuff in acpi_register_gsi()?
Can you post the contents of /proc/interrupts with the floppy
driver and "pci=routeirq"?  It seems weird to have the floppy
and the NIC share an IRQ, but it looks like that's what should
be happening.
