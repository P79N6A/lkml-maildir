I haven't looked at the code, but I'd recommend using a bank of Goertzel 
filters -

+filter+DTMF&btnG=Google+Search
The basic idea is that you have 8 filters (for the 4 row and 4 column 
frequencies), as well as 8 filters looking at the first harmonic of the 
8 frequencies. You then compare the energies in each frequency - if you 
see significant energy in the harmonic filter bank, discard the signal. 
That prevents you from detecting speech as DTMF, since speech will 
usually have harmonics that a good DTMF signal won't.
Since the Goertzel filters are simple, they can be implemented in fixed 
point math rather than floating point. At work, we've done this on a 
Motorola 56301 DSP, which is a fixed-point DSP. I think there's an app 
note from Moto on this - I'll check when I get into work today.
