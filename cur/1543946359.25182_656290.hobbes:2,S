Yes, the dump clearly shows that.
Does anything appear in dmesg when you press those buttons? There should 
be messages resembling the one you already have there:
drivers/hid/hid-core.c: report (size 8) (unnumbered)
drivers/hid/hid-core.c: report 0 (size 8) =  00 00 28 00 00 00 00 00
and they should react to keys such as FastForward, Play, Mute, Volume Up, 
etc.
