Apart from the other issues, it'd be nice to be able to have some way to 
disable 'keyboards'.
For example, I have some CM108 based audio USB cards, which come with 3 
(event generating) keys. These generate events for F13,F14,'help'.
Of course I can do something in my X wm config to get them to do stuff - 
but this is hardly ideal, especially for headless machines, or whatever.
And it utterly breaks if I want to distinguish between 'F13' being 
pressed on the audio device in the kitchen, and the one in the lounge, 
or I want to stop X.
evdev works just fine for this. I'd love to have some way to say 'this 
should never be a core keyboard' - and have it generate no keyboard
events, only output stuff on evdev. As another example - I might like to 
have an unsecured keyboard, to which I can point X - but I never want it 
to allow magic sysrq, or to generate console events if the system isn't 
running X.
The lack of unique per-device IDs is of course really annoying in this case.
