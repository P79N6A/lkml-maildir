If you want to try to reproduce the problem more rapidly, you can try 
the recipe I just suggested to the NVIDIA guys:
Run 2 instances of this C program, with different output files as the 
argument, i.e. save this to fsynctest.c, and do
gcc fsynctest.c -o fsynctest
./fsynctest testfile & ./fsynctest testfile2 &
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <string.h>
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
     int i;
     int fd = open( argv[1], O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, S_IRUSR | 
S_IWUSR);
     if(fd == -1)
     {
         perror("open");
         return 1;
     }
     for(i=0;i<1000000;i++)
     {
         int rc = write(fd, "0", 1);
         if( rc != 1 )
         {
             perror("write");
             return 2;
         }
         rc = fsync(fd);
         if(rc)
         {
             perror("fsync");
             return 2;
         }
     }
     return 0;
}
Also run one instance of this:
dd if=/dev/zero of=blankfile bs=512 count=100000 oflag=direct
and one of this:
while /bin/true; do sdparm --command=sync /dev/sdb; done
all at the same time. In my experience, it helps to disable cpufreq (on 
Red Hat/Fedora, /sbin/service cpuspeed stop) to force the CPU to run at 
max frequency all the time. After a few minutes I got this:
