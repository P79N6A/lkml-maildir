Subject: [patch-2.3.43-pre2] small optimization in drivers/cdrom/mcd.c

Hi Linus,
This patch to drivers/cdrom/mcd.c does:
  a) unifies two sprintf() into one using A ? B : C conditional
  b) sets the info->speed=1 if drive is single-speed (used to be 2)
  c) optimizes intialization of speed=2 away as it is done at
structure initialization level.
