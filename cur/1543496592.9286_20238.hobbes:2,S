Hi,
In addition to my previous post about the hang under heavy network-load:
This time I was able to see the (now unblanked) display, and the following
error-message was given:
eth0: Transmit Timeout, status 0d 0000 media 80
eth0: Tx queue start entry 142224 dirty entry 142224
The network-card in question is a pci ne2k clone of the "rtl8139A" type.
I will try to provoke this error more and try to get some
symbol-information.
Greetings,
  Arjan van de Ven
