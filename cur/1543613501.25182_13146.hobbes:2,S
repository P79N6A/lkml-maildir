Hmm, kernel 2.4.17-rc1 also has this problem.
The reason of this problem is that written is defined as unsigned long
currently, so if generic_file_direct_IO returns -EINVAL, then written
is translated as (unsigned long)(-EINVAL) = (0x100000000-EINVAL). Thus
the file size changed such a big value!
This patch fixes it.

This problem breaks file inode size with direct IO... we lost the
correct file inode size forever. It's serious.  Linus and Marcelo,
please consider to apply this patch?
However, your program does not work yet. Try my test program.  It
works well because valloc()/memalign() allocates aligned page
boundary.
But, my interest is that why we cannot access with stack memory or
malloc()-ed memory. I heard Suresh's program works fine on 2.4.2, but
it does not work on 2.4.17-rc1. Should we modify the kernel to work
well with user stack/heap memory when we use direct IO for the file ?
Or, this behavior is absolutely correct ?

{
	char *buf;
	int fd;
	buf = valloc(16384);
	fd = open("/tmp/blah", O_CREAT | O_RDWR | O_DIRECT, 0755 );
	printf("write returns %i\n", write(fd, buf, 4096));
	return 0;
