If option b) is chosen Reiser4 can become a playground.
There is the reiser4() syscall which you surely don't want to implement for 
other filesystems.
Once there is some experience with this new fancy stuff the dust what
is useful/insecure, etc. and what is not will settle and can be condensed
into a vfs api.
Apps like samba and user scripts will have to be adapted once this is
the case, but this should not be to big a problem if this stuff is marked 
experimental.
People which want something stable can continue to use xattrs and a
magnitude of filesystems for now.
