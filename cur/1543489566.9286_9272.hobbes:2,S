Okay, that's easy. Look in /usr/include/linux/ppp-comp.h
It says that deflate is 26, BSD Compress is 21, deflate draft is 24.
These are the things it's looking for. Therefore:
alias ppp-compress-21 bsd_comp
alias ppp-compress-24 ppp_deflate
alias ppp-compress-26 ppp_deflate
However, I have noticed that 26 somtimes points to 'equ' on some
systems
