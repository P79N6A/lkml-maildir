Would you happen to be using 3c509 cards?  I had a machine at work with our
ISP connection on a 3c509.  After about 130 days (I know you said 20, but it
was 130 for me), the card quit, no incoming, no outgoing.  I thought the
card quit, but I put it in another machine, no problems, so I assume the
driver quit.  ifconfig eth[x] down;ifconfig eth[x] up;<add routes here> and
everything works...  for 5-10 minutes.  Unloading the module didn't help.
This may be completely unrelated, but while I was changing HW on that
machine, another box (up for 131 days) rebooted on me for no reason (it's
behind a firewall, and the people at the place aren't that good.  I also
noted that nothing appeared in the log.  FSCK took it's tole on the box
too).  Is it just a coincidence that the machine that rebooted like that has
the same 2 nics?  (both boxes: 3c905b(eth0) and 3c509(eth1), same mobo, both
using SMP kernel, the one with the ISP had 1 cpu removed to get around IDE
lockups.   Kernels: 2.2.10 on isp box, 2.2.13 on box that rebooted for no
reason)
