Even if true (which I doubt), this is not implemented.
A modern drive can have 16-32 MB of write cache. Worst case, those 
sectors are not sequential which implies lots of head movement.

I can tell you directly that when you drop power to a drive, you will 
lose write cache data if the write cache is enabled. With barriers 
enabled, our testing shows that file systems survive power failures 
which routinely caused corruption without them ;-)
