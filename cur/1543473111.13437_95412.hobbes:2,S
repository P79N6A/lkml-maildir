Today I have bought ASUS CD ROM 340 (34x) CD-S340/34/G
I tested it in windows95,dos and it is good and it's fast :))) BUT
when I tried to boot in linux-2.1.132 it detects my hda-IBM HARD
and my hdc-ASUS 340 an then repeat these errors (seen by my eyes:)
hdc: lost interrupt
hdc: cdrom_pc_inr: the drive apppears confused (ireason= 0x 1)
hdc: lost interrupt
hdc: cdrom_pc_inr: the drive apppears confused (ireason= 0x 1)
and again and again ....   ... and I am forced to press reset button :(
I had to disconect my cdrom and I recompile kernel again
(mrproper ...) but it was the same don't even boot because cd rom
then i tested 2.1.131 2.1.130 2.1.129 and they also don't boot!
at last I boot in 2.0.36 & 2.0.35 it worked fine except few times
inly when booting I got following error: (cut&paste)
INIT: Entering runlevel: 3
Going multiuser...
Kernel detected ATAPI CDROM drive /dev/hdc, checking for a disc:
mount: block device /dev/hdc is write-protected, mounting read-only
hdc: irq timeout: status=0x58
hdc: ATAPI reset complete
hdc: status error: status=0x51
hdc: status error: error=0x04
hdc: media changed
ISO9660 Extensions: Microsoft Joliet Level 1
Mounting remote file systems...
this error is gone when i umont and mount another cd rom!
WORKAROUND : how to boot in 2.1.129+
I had installed dos drivers for asus (but works with all atapi drivers ??
it worked with my old atapi goldstarcd driver and ibmcd.sys driver in dos )
and from dos i did:
dir d:             ; this only spins drive ( drive d is cdrom ) 
c:\linux\loadlin vmlinuz  root=/dev/hda4  ro  vga=3
and it booted in linux-2.1.132 fine and it works great under linux
I 'am sure that the problem is in atapi driver for linux kernel!
I added Driver.txt & Readme.txt from driver disk
Keep on good work on 2.1.132+ it is great :)

 Introduction
===============
Thanks for purchasing the ASUS high-speed CD-ROM drive. Before using
this drive, you are suggested to read this file carefully.
The installation disk contains files necessary for the CD-ROM driver
for DOS/Win3.x installation. The disk contents include:
    *  ASUSCD.SYS        ASUS CD-ROM driver for MS-DOS/Win3.x.
    *  INSTALL.EXE       ASUS CD-ROM drive installation utility.
    *  README.TXT        The description and use of the files.
====================
 System Requirement
====================
  Hardware Requirements
  ---------------------
     1. IBM PC/AT or compatible computer
     2. one free IDE socket
     3. one IDE CD-ROM drive
  Software Requirement
  --------------------
     1. MS-DOS version 5.0 or later
     2. Microsoft Windows 3.1 or later
     3. MS-DOS CD-Extension (MSCDEX.EXE) V2.21 or later
==============
 Installation
==============
  To install the CD-ROM driver for DOS/Win3.x, please follow the
  subsequent steps:
    1. Restart your computer in DOS mode.
    2. Insert the CD-ROM Driver Installation Disk into your floopy
       disk drive (either Drive A or Drive B).
    3. At the DOS prompt, type "A:install" (or "B:install") and press
       [Enter].
    4. Choose your preferred setup option and follow the instructions
       on the installation screen.
    5. Reboot your system.
  There are two setup options, the Express Setup and the Custom Setup.
  Express Setup
  -------------
    The Express Setup will install the CD-ROM driver by its default.
    If you are a novice in computer, it is suggested that you use this
    option.
    The Express Setup will
    1. copy Installation Disk files to C:\ASUS_CD directory.
    2. back up CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT to CONFIG.000 and
       AUTOEXEC.000 respectively.
    3. modify CONFIG.SYS by adding the following lines:
        [COMMON]
        DEVICE=C:\ASUS_CD\ASUSCD.SYS /D:ASUSCD01
        LASTDRIVE=Z
    4. modify AUTOEXEC.BAT by adding the following line:
        C:\DOS\MSCDEX.EXE /D:ASUSCD01 /V    or
        C:\WINDOWS\COMMAND\MSCDEX.EXE /D:ASUSCD01 /V
        depending on where the MSCDEX.EXE is located.
  Custom Setup
  ------------
    Choose the Custom Setup option to customize the folloing
    installation settings.
    (a) Boot Drive:
        The Boot Drive option specifies your booting disk label.
        Normally it is set to C.
    (b) Target Directory:
        The Target Directory is the path where the device driver is
        installed to. By default, it is set to C:\ASUS_RD.
    (c) Device Name:
        The Device Name is the name of your CD-ROM device driver, By
        default, it is set to ASUSCD01.
    (d) MSCDEX's Directory:
        This option specifies the path where the Microsoft CD-Extension
        program, MSCDEX.EXE, is located.
    (e) Transfer Mode:
        There are three transfer modes available:
        * PIO Mode:
               The Programmed Input/Output Mode is the most common way
               computers transferring data to and from the disk drive.
               The ASUS CD-ROM Drive supports PIO Mode Transfer up to
               PIO mode 4. If your PC is not out of date, it should be
               able to support this mode.
        * Multi-word DMA Mode:
               This mode utilizes the Bus Master DMA transfer protocol.
               The advantage of using the Bus Master DMA transfer mode
               is that it uses less CPU resources than the PIO mode and
               therefore, it is useful in multi-tasking environments.
        * Ultra DMA Mode:
               This mode is also known as Ultra-ATA or Ultra-DMA/33.
               It is the most up to date technique for IDE bus data
               transfer protocol recently.
    Then, the Custome Setup will
    1. copy Installation Disk files to the <Target Path> directory.
    2. back up CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT to CONFIG.000 and
       AUTOEXEC.000 respectively.
    3. modify CONFIG.SYS by adding the following line:
        Device=<Target Path>\ASUSCD.SYS /D:<Device Name> /<Transfer Mode>
    4. modify AUTOEXEC.BAT by adding the following line:
        [COMMON]
        <MSCDEX's Directory>\MSCDEX.EXE /D:ASUSCD01 /V
        LASTDRIVE=Z
The meanings of the drive parameters are described as follows:
       <Target Path>:
          The path that the CD-ROM driver is installed to. The default
          path is "C:\ASUS_CD".
       <Device Name>:
          The name of your CD-ROM device driver, "ASUSCD01" is used by
          default.
       <Transfer Mode>:
          The CD-ROM data transfer mode. If not specified, PIO mode
          will be used. Theree transfer mode are available:
                 PIO:  PIO transfer mode.
                 DMA:  Mult-word DMA transfer mode.
                 UDMA: Ultra DMA transfer mode.
       <MSCDEX's Directory>:
          The directory where MSCDEX.EXE is located.
For more detailed information of the device driver parameters, please
refer to DRIVER.TXT.
