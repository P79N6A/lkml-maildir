How about how easy it is to create a totally bogus config for any arch?
This isn't a UML problem, this is a cross compiling for any arch
problem.

The following argument makes less sense, possibly, as 2.6 lives on, but
this is new breakage for people moving up from 2.4 that just looked in
.config and arch/$(ARCH)/defconfig and who don't otherwise know that
things have been changed or broken, depending on how you look at it.

I disagree.  This solves the "why did the kernel decide to look at
/boot/config when it really should have known better" problem.

We already have part of this, except I don't know for certain of
CONFIG_ARCH == CONFIG_$(SUBARCH) (... to mix syntax all the hell up).
