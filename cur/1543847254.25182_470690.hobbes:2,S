No, please no links if you have stuff that can be expressed in a tree,
which you perfectly can in this case. Just create a parent "card-device"
to hold the generic card attributes, and put the stuff like pcmC0* below
that device. Userspace is fine with that and will not break,
cause /sys/class/sound/* is still just a flat directory with all devices
in one directory, only the link targets will point to a hierarchy (note
that the link target of "pcmC1D0c" includes" Audigy2". )

That looks nice. Yeah, it should something that matches to the C1 in the
other names.

This should be fine for all recent releases including SLE.
