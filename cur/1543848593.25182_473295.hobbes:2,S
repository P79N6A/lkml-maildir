But what is an "unexpected" "error"?  Not every fault that's unexpected
is an error; consider a page fault.
Consider also kfree(NULL).  The same motivation for drivers not needing
to validate that parameter is behind arguing that device drivers should
not need to poke around in PCI config space to verify that the device
supports MWI; and should have the flexibility to ignore the return code,
just like kfree() returns no value.

I know that it enables MWI accesses ... or fails.  Beyond that, there
should be no reason to care.  If the hardware can use a lower-overhead
type of PCI bus cycle, I want it to do so.  If not, no sweat.

The reason I think it's important enough to continue this discussion is
that as it currently stands, it's a good example of a **BAD** interface
design ... since it's pointlessly marked as must_check.  (See appended
patch to fix that issue.)
If you wouldn't want all callers of kfree() to say "if (ptr) kfree(ptr);";
why then would anyone want to demand
	... read the pci config space byte (and cleanly handle errors) ...
	... check for the MWI bit ...
	... if it's set (so we "expect" this next call to succeed) then:
		... call pci_set_mwi() ...
		... test set_mwi() value ...
		... ignore that value ...
where the first three lines duplicate code _inside_ pci_set_mwi(), and the
last two lines are obviously a pure waste of code and effort.  I'd want to
know the criteria by which "if(ptr)" is judged a waste of effort in all
callers, but that more extensive PCI configspace logic was not...

-------------------- CUT HERE
Remove bogus annotation of pci_set_mwi() as __must_check.  It's completely
reasonable for drivers to not care about the return code, when all they're
doing is enabling an optional performance-improving mechanism that's often
not even available.
