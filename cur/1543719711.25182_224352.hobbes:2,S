Well, after thinking awhile, I have changed it so that 0 means power on,
1..3 intermediate values (although for now they are interpreted as poweroff by
existing drivers since there are no intermediate states) and 4 is 'off for
real'. Indeed, there is no much reason to have them use different semantics.

No, they are registered just as a class device. There is no corresponding
device on any other bus, this would mean a lot of unneeded overhead.

Um, well, the LCD device actually has two power controls, like I said
before: one toggles the power to the LCD itself, another one (the 'enable'
attribute) controls power to the LCD controller. Not that this explicit
separate control is required very much, but it would be nice to have a degree
of freedom close to that allowed by hardware.
In theory, if we would use the standard power interface, it could use the
different levels of power saving, e.g. 0 - controller and LCD on, 1,2 - LCD
off, controller on, 3,4 - both off.

Well, the LCD panel is controllable only through the LCD controller, so for
the most part they are the same. The only thing is that the LCD controller has
a one-bit switch to disable the power to the panel. I don't think it makes
sense to separate that bit into a separate device.

Well, the power interface under drivers/ is available for framebuffer.
If it would handle it properly (the framebuffer drivers I've tried
don't, alas), they would toggle the attached (to the framebuffer) LCD
and backlight power state according to its own state (which is not so fine
grained, but is logical). In any case, one of reasons this backlight/lcd patch
has been written was to avoid that mess with callbacks that lately begun to
appear in ARM-specific framebuffer devices (and I shudder at the thought that
MIPS people should be doing something similar).
