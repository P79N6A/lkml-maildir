I agree. But it would be nice if some basic instructions still worked: as 
is, you cannot even do things like reloading %eflags, because the only way 
to do that requires a stack.

Yeah. Even if it was just re-using the boot-time stack area temporarily, 
just to give code the choice to use a common set of instructions.
