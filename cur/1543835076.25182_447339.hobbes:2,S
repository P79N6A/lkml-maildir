Hello,
I have done a look-through through Documentation/kbuild/ and my corrections 
(proposed) are attached. It is bzipped because the uncompressed diff is 
41KB and may have get stuck on the magic list limit (30 or 40, I believe 40).
Cc'ed are original author Michael (responsible for comitting changes to 
these files?), Sam (kbuild maintainer), Adrian (-trivial maintainer).

I have noticed more inconsistencies ("architecture-specific" vs 
"architecture specific"), mixed use of American -z- and British -s- 
(such as customize/customise), and more. This patch is a simple start that 
does not go into language pickyness. Except maybe for commas :)
Regards,
Jan Engelhardt
