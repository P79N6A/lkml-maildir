Hi,
Sometimes we could hotplug a PCIE device, which require more MMIO
resource than that reserved by BIOS.
My question is: is there a way for kernel to reserved more MMIO
resource for a PCIE-hotplug-capable slot? I searched the
kernel-parameters.txt, but didn't find any related information.
Thanks,
Forrest
