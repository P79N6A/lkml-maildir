You can pick the Pentium-III here, since you have a Coppermine core
Celeron.  But this will almost surely not be any part of the solution to
the problem.

I'd turn this off, just to see if it makes any change.  It says it is
"believed to be safe", but it is experimental, and your controller BIOS
almost surely does not support it.

Other than the EDD setting, I see nothing.  What do you have in the next
choice after ACPI, the APM stuff?
Also, can you see anything on the screen before it reboots?  There is
nothing after "Uncompressing kernel..."?  Just boom, it reboots?
There isn't much that can trigger a reboot that early on.
