Thankyou for making that clear.
I am currently working towards testing a patch that will fix the
behaviour of glibc.
Currently the sunrpc/svc_udp.c code asks for an IP_PKTINFO from
recvmsg, and passes it verbatim down through sendmsg.
My patch checks that the returned data looks believable and, if it
does, zeros the ipi_ifindex field.
