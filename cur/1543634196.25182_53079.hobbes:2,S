So you're going to have separate interfaces for that? Gag me with a volvo,
but that's idiotic.
Besides, even that would be broken. You want bitmaps, because bitmaps is
really what it is all about. It's NOT about "I must run on this CPU", it
can equally well be "I mustn't run on those two CPU's that are hosting the
RT part of this thing" or something like that.
