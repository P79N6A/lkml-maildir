I think in the short term your best bet is to globally disable SMI at early
boot stage (ie before TSC calibration).
Some people might argue that it's not the most graceful solution because it might
brake some BIOS features but it's a very common trick that is used by RT folks
(for example RTAI has configurable option to enable SMI workaround) because
on some chipset/BIOS combinations SMIs introduce horrible latencies. And you
cannot do much about that other than disabling SMI.
I have not seen any reports of negative side effects of disabling SMI yet. But
if you're worried about that you could re-enable it later when you're done with
TSC calibration and stuff.
