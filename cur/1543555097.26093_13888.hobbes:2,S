Hmm. What does it take to mount an NFS partition?
Anyway.  All I did was wrote a tiny libc that is just a bunch of
wrappers for syscalls, and some string functions.  Then I just wrote
a straight forward C program to do the job.  Except for my added
kexec call I can compile with glibc :)
Now if glibc wouldn't link in 200k of unused crap when you make a
trivial static binary I'd much prefer to use it...
Though I wish it was possible to have a ramfs preloader instead of
initrd.  An initramfs would allow me to not even compile in the block
device driver layer, and be more efficient.
