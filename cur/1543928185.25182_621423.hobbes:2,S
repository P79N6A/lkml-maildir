I assume this machine with a huge number of adapters has a huge amount
of memory too! :-)

We can add this.

The kexec tools userspace control this.  Normally it just takes the
current device tree plus some modifications (eg. initrd location
changes).
So provided the ehea driver export this info somewhere, it can be
grabbed by the kexec tools and stuffed in the device tree of the new
kernel.  
That being said, the proper place to have this would be original device
tree.
