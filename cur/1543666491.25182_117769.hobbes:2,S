I'm heavily on the side of deterministic bounds here (these things trip
the NMI oopser, so if the bounds aren't deterministic, neither is
stability), so I favor manfred's proc_pid_readdir() algorithm.
It actually looks compatible with your prior patch aside from replacing
and/or modifying its get_pid_list() speedup.
