I have the bttv driver compiled into the kernel. With the latest
bttv updates, the tuner driver does not get initialized at boot.
This gets fixed by including <linux/version.h> in i2c.h.
A quick look in the source tells me that there might be more
problems with non-module v4l drivers, because there are
lots of '#if LINUX_VERSION_CODE...'s in the header files.
it might be necessary to include version.h in either videodev.h,
i2c.h and bttv.h or everything depending on them.
