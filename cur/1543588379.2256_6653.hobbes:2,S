It has nothing to do with smp ;)
spl levels are actually faster, because hardware interrupt locking
routines are poorly optimized in processors.
I looked at P-6 instruction timing table and found:
PUSHF	16 upos
POPF	17 uops
CLI	9 uops
STI	17 uops
I think soft interrupt locks like this would be better (at least on i386):
cli:
	movb $0, intr_lock
sti:
	movb $1, intr_lock
	testb $1, intr_pending
	jnz somewhere_away_to_handle_defered_interrupt
save_flags:
	movb intr_lock, %al
restore_flags:
	movb %al, intr_lock
	testb %al, intr_pending
	jnz somewhere_away_to_handle_defered_interrupt
And - of course - interrupt checks intr_lock in its entry and if it is
zero, sets intr_pending and exits immediatelly.
