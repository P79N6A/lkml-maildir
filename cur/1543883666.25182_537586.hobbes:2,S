Apologies to all concerned for an unfortunate delay in resolving this.
I chose "unwisely" when I picked a popular experimental distro's
2.6.20 kernel source as a base for my troubleshooting efforts.  The
resulting kernel panics when it tries to load the initial ramdisk, and
I don't have the patience to track down which of the turned-on-by-default
experimental configuration parameters might be causing the problem.
I'll go retrieve a more conservatively-configured source tree (closer to
what DSL-N uses) and start over...
