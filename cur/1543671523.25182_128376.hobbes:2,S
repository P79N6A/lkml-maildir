I would REALLY appreciate it, if someone could clarify this issue for me.
When testing the latest 2.5 kernels, I've frequently come across issues
where the headers in /usr/include conflict with the headers packaged with
the kernel.  I was under the assumption that when compiling user mode
programs, such as the LTP test suite, we should use the headers in
/usr/include.  However, I have had some kernel developers tell me that I
should compile against the kernel includes.....could I get some
clarification on this?
