This problem is fixed in Paul Moore's latest spin of the networking patches - I
was able to quilt up a fixed-up -rc8-mm1 with an updated git-lblnet.patch built
from his latest patch-bomb (labelled as 'RFC PATCH v12' posted to the selinux
and linux-security-module lists on Thursday, so the next pull of that git tree
into -mm should be OK...
