Let's see the Kconfig entry currently reads:

So I don't know if we are defaulting it to off but we are advising it be
turned off.  So all of the bug reports are coming from people who presumably
know what they are doing and deliberately turn it on.
Once things quite down and we fix the chipset support detection then I think
we can default it to on.  Once that settles down we can remove the manual
option entirely except possibly under CONFIG_EMBEDDED.
We certainly don't have the question does this chipset support MSI handled
well enough to do better right now.  I think non-x86 might but we certainly
don't.
