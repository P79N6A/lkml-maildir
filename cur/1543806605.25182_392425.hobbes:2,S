It works also without ACPI.
But in the long run something like this could be added for ACPI to allow
easy addition of custom PM modules. That was discussed briefly on the ACPI
list and people seemed to be OK with adding system for custom PM modules.
And if it was integrated with ACPI, only enabling the C states should be
enough, and then ACPI would just know how to use the C states...
