Raise the quality.  Then the volume will automatically decrease.
Which leads us to...  the volume isn't a problem per-se.  The problem is
quality.  It's the fact that they vary inversely which makes us say "slow
down".
So David's Subject: should have been "Do Better, please".  Slowing down is
just a side-effect.  And, we expect, a tool.
We should be discussing how to raise the quality of our work.
