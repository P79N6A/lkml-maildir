I tried this here too, and while I'm not at the console to try the
mouse, the times for 'ipmitool sensor list' are still within the same
range (5-10 seconds, average is about 6) as with udelay(1) instead.
Running some load generators to keep the CPUs pegged didn't change
this result either.  So I'm inclined to agree changing to schedule()
is the right approach.
Thanks,
Matt
