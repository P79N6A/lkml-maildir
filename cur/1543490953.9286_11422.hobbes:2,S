Well, maybe. You're suggesting a scheme which has a number
of problems WRT file ownerships and so forth. A system with
a disempowered root (uid 0 not privileged) and a full-up
capability mechanism would be better. Some of the "Trusted"
systems tried changing the ownerships of system files away
from root and found a horrid nest of assumptions in applications.
