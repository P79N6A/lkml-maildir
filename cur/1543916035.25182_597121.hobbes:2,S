Here we save also kernel B's pages.

0-640K from kernel A overrides 0-640K of kernel C at restore time.

This steps replaces kernel C's pages with kernel B's (at least 15m-16m), 
saved at step 8, so these kernels should be equal? Or they must be 
physically located in non-overlapping regions such that C is in B's 
memory range but non-overlapping. The proposed setup doesn't guaratee 
this afaics.
