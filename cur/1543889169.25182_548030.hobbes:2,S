i dont think it's due to code reordering. The code that lockdep flagged 
is the new code in arch/i386/kernel/bootflag.c, sbf_read() and 
sbf_write(). It does:
                spin_lock_irqsave(&rtc_lock, flags);
                CMOS_WRITE(v, sbf_port);
                spin_unlock_irqrestore(&rtc_lock, flags);
and:
        spin_lock_irqsave(&rtc_lock, flags);
        v = CMOS_READ(sbf_port);
        spin_unlock_irqrestore(&rtc_lock, flags);
and is apparently called with the xtime_lock held. Was that code ever 
booted with CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING enabled?
