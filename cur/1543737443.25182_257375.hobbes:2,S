I think there are 3 cases when page_count(page) == 0.
1. a page is free and in the buddy allocator.
2. a page is free and in per-cpu-pages list.
3. a page is in pagevec .
I think only case 1 pages meet your requirements.
I used PG_private flag for distinguishing case 1 from 2 and 3
in my no-bitmap buddy allocator posted before.
I added PG_private flag to a page which is in buddy allocator's free_list.
