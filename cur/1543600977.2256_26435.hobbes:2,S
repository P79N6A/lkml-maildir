It barfs on our 4way with the FD management patch and chat benchmark :-)

You changed the way I maintained the wait_list and current_list.
The basic logic was that new callbacks are always added to the
wait list. The wait_for_rcu() is started only if current_list
was empty and we just moved the wait_list to current_list. The
key step was moving the wait_list to current_list *after* doing
a wait_for_rcu(). This prevents another CPU from doing a wait_for_rcu().
Either that or I missed something big time :-)

Serializing is not what I want to do either. Instead the other
CPUs just add to the wait_list and return if there is a wait_for_rcu()
going on. What we have seen is that relatively larger batches around
a single recurring wait_for_rcu() will do reasonably well in terms
of performance.

It should be possible to do this. However, I am not sure we would
really benefit significantly from allowing multiple wait_for_rcu()s
to run parallelly. I would much rather see per-CPU lists implemented
and avoid keventd eventually.

One disadvantage of the wrappers is that we would be wasting most of
the L1 cache line for rcu_head and that could be relatively significant for 
a small frequently allocated structure. And no, I don't see any problem asking
people to allocate the rcu_head in the data structure.
