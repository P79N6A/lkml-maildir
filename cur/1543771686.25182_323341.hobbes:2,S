This is the guy - startblock being zero is fatal.  You'll need to
run xfs_repair to clear that up.  If you know how it got in that
state, I'd be keen to hear it, or if it persists after repair.
[Arun, those superblock checks you added awhile back should be
shutting down the filesystem, not panicing the system, I think?
It looks like theres a signedness issue in the diagnostics too.]

Repairing that inode should make it go away entirely.
cheers.
