Hi Greg,
I agree, it should be done in the driver core.  The LLDD is registering
with the SAS class (unfinished, incomplete) and this is what appears:
/sys/class/sas/
/sys/class/sas/ha0/
/sys/class/sas/ha0/device -> link to PCI device
/sys/class/sas/ha0/device_name
where device name is the SAS address attribute (RO).
I'd ideally like to have a link to the LLDD in there
as well:
/sys/class/sas/ha0/driver -> link to the driver
But this host adapter registration with the SAS class happens
at pci_probe time, *at pci_register_driver* time so it seems that this
is the reason for the oops. (as opposed to PCI hot plugging the controller)

It is the kobj of "ha0" which was just registered with class_device_register().
I suspect since all this is called from pci_probe at module init, it is
failing for the 2nd kobj, the driver.
Would this imply that had pci_probe been called on a PCI hot plug event
(not at pci_driver_register() time) then that symlink would've succeeded?
(since the driver had been registered already)
If so, can we reconcile this somehow so that code executed in pci_probe
at time B, could've also been executed at time A, A < B?

It is quite incomplete.  Let me have something substantial and I'll post it
and then we can figure it out.  For now that line is /* XXX it would be good... */

Thanks,
