I've hit assertion() /fs/jbd/transaction.c:1115 several times. Can't
tell anything else, as immediately after this keyboard gets locked, X still
reacts on _mouse_ (copy/paste thing) , but probably after hitting
disk/filesystem every application locks. for example cpu load meter
which open-read /proc gets frozen right away.
/var/log/messages doesn't tell a thing. Seems random.
kernel 2.5.70-mm3.
