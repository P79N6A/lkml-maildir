Ye ghods, yes. What do you get when you readdir()
/proc/sys/net/permissions/udp? All currently bound sockets? 65k files?
(The former would obviously be preferred...)

devfs. /proc just seems wrong for anything like this, but maybe it's my
distaste of /proc being polluted for configuration controls showing.
