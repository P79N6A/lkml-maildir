Jeff, from a security aspect would it perhaps be better to have the
filter always in place and load rule sets through a rigidly controlled
interface? This gives a control hook for non-Unixoid security model
control over the interface filtering. The filter module would have the
lower level interfaces all opened exclusively so there would be no
paths around the filter. I propose that the rule sets, for each
device's instance of the filter interface, could be changed to include
anything from a null set to forbidding anything past fully controlled
read and write with no raw IO. One specific entity could be allowed
to make the changes and no others. This gives a single interface for
verifying signatures on filter data sets, as well.
