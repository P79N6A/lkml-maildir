Sounds good. Note though that this just means renaming clear_page to
clear_pages for all arches which would increase the patch size for the
arch specific section.

That would get us back to code duplication. We would have a clear_page (no
highmem support) and a clear_pages (supporting highmem). Then it may
also be better to pass the page struct to clear_pages instead of a memory address.
