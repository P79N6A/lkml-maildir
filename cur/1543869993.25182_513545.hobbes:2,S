Subject: lanana: Add major/minor entries for PPC QE UART devices

Hi,
(Email to device@lanana.org bounces, so I'm sending this to lkml instead.)
I'm working on a UART device driver for the Freescale PowerPC QUICCEngine, which
is a replacement for the CPM.  Since the QE is basically "CPM v3", and you can't
have a CPM and a QE on the same board, I figure that they can share the same
minor numbers.
I've attached a patch that adds these entries to major number 204.  Please not
that there's a small typo for /dev/ttyCPM5, and I've fixed that in the patch as
well.
Please let me know if my proposal/patch is acceptable, and if not, what changes
you want me to make.  Thanks.
patch:
Fixed a typo with /dev/ttyCPM5.  Added entries for /dev/ttyQE0-3.  The QE
is a replacement for the CPM, so they can share the same minor numbers.
