Alan, do you mean the case implemented in the IA64 tree? I was terribly out
of time so I had to do something quick and dirty. The IRQ0 was not nearly as
bad as the rest of the legacy drivers asking for the "IRQ3" and "4" etc. I
haven't looked into other arch's implementations - who else has done it? Was
it ever case similar to ours in others?
Thanks,
