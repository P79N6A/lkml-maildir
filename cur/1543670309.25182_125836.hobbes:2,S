I managed to avoid some of these things:
1. I compiled everything in-kernel and disabled modules, thus no modules
   related problems (*)
2. RH9 procutils _seems_ to work fine: I can do "vmstat 1" whereas the older
   gentoo image from summer I used to test boot 2.5 didn't.
(*) RH9 detected my elitegroup motherboard integrated sound and unsed the i810
    module, but now with everything in it seems I can't have sound any ideas?
    Hmm, yes I _did_ compile i810 support in-kernel ;)
I'm also having another problem: gnome-terminal is freaking out when i run
"make menuconfig" on it, very strange....
