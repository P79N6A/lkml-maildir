Hi Andi,
Here's a repost of the paravirt_ops update series I posted the other day.
Since then, I found a few potential bugs with patching clobbering,
cleaned up and documented paravirt.h and the patching machinery.
Overview:
add-MAINTAINERS.patch
	obvious
remove-CONFIG_DEBUG_PARAVIRT.patch
	No longer meaningful or needed.
paravirt-nop.patch
	Clean up nop paravirt_ops functions, mainly to allow the patching
	machinery to easily identify them.
paravirt-pte-accessors.patch
	Accessors to allow pv_ops to control the content of pagetable entries.
paravirt-memory-init.patch
	Hook into initial pagetable creation.
paravirt-fixmap.patch
	Create a fixmap for early paravirt_ops mappings.
shared-kernel-pmd.patch
	Make the choice of whether the kernel pmd is shared between
	processes or not a runtime selectable flag.
mm-lifetime-hooks.patch
	Hooks to allow the creation, use and destruction of an mm_struct
	to be followed.
paravirt-patch-rename-paravirt_patch.patch
	Rename a structure to make its use a bit more clear.
paravirt-use-offset-site-ids.patch
	Use the offsetof each function pointer in paravirt_ops as the
	basis of its patching identifier.
paravirt-fix-clobbers.patch
	Fix up various register/use clobber problems.  This may be 2.6.21
	material, but I don't think it will materially affect VMI.
paravirt-patchable-call-wrappers.patch
	Wrap each paravirt_ops call to allow the callsites to be runtime
	patched.
paravirt-document-paravirt_ops.patch
	Document the paravirt_ops structure itself, the patching
	mechanism, and other cleanups.
paravirt-patch-machinery.patch
	General patch machinery for use by pv_ops backends to implment
	patching.
paravirt-flush_tlb_others.patch
	Add a hook for cross-cpu tlb flushing.
revert-map_pt_hook.patch
	Back out the map_pt_hook change.
paravirt-kmap_atomic_pte.patch
	Replace map_pt_hook with kmap_atomic_pte.
cleanup-tsc-sched-clock.patch
	Clean up the tsc-based sched_clock.  (I think you already
	have this.)
paravirt-sched-clock.patch
	Add a hook for sched_clock, so that paravirt_ops backends can
	report unstolen time for use as the scheduler clock.
apply-to-page-range.patch
	Apply a function to a range of pagetable entries.
Thanks,
	J
