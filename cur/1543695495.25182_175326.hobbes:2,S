Andre, if you were trying to say what i am about to, i
apologise.

I have dialoged with Eric Mudama.  He is 99% sure that no
manufacturer of is making ATA drives with physical sectors
larger than 512B.  I'll let that statement trump Norman
Diamond's until i hear otherwise.
The drive manufacturers would like to be able to go to a
larger physical sector but the read-modify-write is just too
scary.  If they could be sure of market acceptance of drives
that required all I/O to be in larger units they would build
them because it would allow greater capacity (and i'm
guessing speed as well) on the same physical hardware.
I look forward to the day with Linux has enough market-share
to influence the hardware manufacturers.
In any case, unless someone can authoritatively contradict
Eric we can ignore the firmware read-modify-write
implications of unreadable sectors.
End-of-subthread!
or in the words of Emily Latella "Never-mind".
