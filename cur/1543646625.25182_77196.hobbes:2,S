The orginal use for DEVFS_FL_AUTO_OWNER was for PTY slaves,
particularly the BSD-style ones. It allows a non-suid root process to
open an unused PTY and be given ownership of it. Good for non-suid
xterms.
Later, I created DEVFS_FL_CURRENT_OWNER, and used that (in combination
with unregistering PTY slaves when the master is closed). That seemed
a cleaner approach.

Well, I can't comment on the video1394 driver. I don't really know why
they are using DEVFS_FL_AUTO_OWNER. If their device node is safe to
have rw-rw-rw- (like with PTY slaves), then it's not a problem.
However, if the driver allows you to do Bad Things[tm] if you can read
or write to the device node, then the driver is buggy, and is abusing
DEVFS_FL_AUTO_OWNER.
So we should get input from the driver maintainer as to what the
intent is.
