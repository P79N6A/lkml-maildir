IMO one should seek to avoid sharing an IRQ line at all.  I dunno that 
you really want to tune for that case, when the user could vastly 
improve the situation by manipulating IRQs in BIOS setup or similar 
IRQ-distribution methods.
On an SMP box you especially want to distribute irqs to take best 
advantage of irq affinity.
