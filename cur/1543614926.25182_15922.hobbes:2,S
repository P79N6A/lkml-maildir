Some people asked for what my patch looked like, so I resurrected it. I 
moved it to 2.5.2-pre3. As it caused lots of rejects (maintaining kbuild 
is a non-trivial task, isn't it, Keith?), I only fixed the problems for my 
.config. So the attached patch will break with most .configs. However, 
people who want to take a look can take my .config and play with that - 
it's strictly proof-of-concept only. 
(The breakage is easily fixable, it's just quite a bit of mostly trivial 
work).
And yes, it doesn't fix the separate source / objects tree issue. But IMO
that's not a problem that needs to be fixed, it's an additional feature
which I didn't even try to attack (it may be possible to get there with
VPATH, though).
To try it, patch your kernel,
mv ../config-2.5 .config
make oldconfig
make # builds bzImage and modules
A subsequent make will only rebuild what's needed:
[kai@vaio linux-2.5.2-pre3.kbuild]$ time make
make -f Makefile.build boot

For each make, compile.h is updated, thus causing init/version.o to be 
recompiled and vmlinux to be relinked. - I kept the behavior of the 
current kbuild. Not regenerating compile.h will give:
[kai@vaio linux-2.5.2-pre3.kbuild]$ time make
make -f Makefile.build boot
make[1]: Entering directory 
`/home/kai/kernel/v2.5/linux-2.5.2-pre3.kbuild'
