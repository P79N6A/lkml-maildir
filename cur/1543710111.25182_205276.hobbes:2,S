OK, thanks for the reference. I wonder what other packages use 
BSD accounting.

Huh, are we talking about the same format? I think comp_t rather looks
like this:
  eeemmmmmmmmmmmmm
i.e., three bit (base 8) exponent, followed by 13 bits mantissa.
mantissa is right-aligned, so I don't understand why you are talking 
about denormals at all.
The base 8 exponent indeed wastes up to two bits of the mantissa, but it
saves two bits of the exponent, so it's as good in the worst case and
gains one bit of precision on average.
The largest representable number (as I see it) is only (2^13-1) * 8^7
= 0x3ffe00000, i.e. a 34 bit number.
What's wrong with my view?

I really don't know which leading 1 you are talking about.

great idea - it even allows to keep source code compatibility with
(at least) the GNU acct tools!

No, but I think it's just not worth expanding struct acct.

too unpredictable, I think.
e. suddenly pops to my mind:  #define AHZ 10      /* ;-) */ 
   but b. seems superior to me as it increases precision as well and
   we can afford it.

I'd guess I'll have to update my K&R to ANSI on that...

That sounds good. A version magic at the beginning of the struct would
allow us to extend it more easily.
