very interesting, nfs is indeed one of the frequent BKL users.
a 'BKL leak' is an unbalanced lock, e.g.:
	lock_kernel();
	... do stuff ...
	if (error)
		return;
	... do more stuff ...
	unlock_kernel();
the BKL is a very special type of lock which fact has the side-effect
that in the stock kernel a 'BKL leak' can go unnoticed very easily: it
causes no problems other than hard-to-debug (but severe) scalability
regressions. The moment the BKL count leaked from the NFS code that
process has been 'scalability-poisoned' and will be handicapped until it
exits.
In the PREEMPT_RT patchset i added a strict locking checker to do_exit()
that found this apparent NFS bug. Unfortunately the deadlock detector
only reported a pretty common place where the BKL gets
dropped/reacquired frequently so we dont know where the NFS code has the
lock/unlock imbalance. Could you report this bug to the NFS maintainers
(along with the above and the previous analysis)?
