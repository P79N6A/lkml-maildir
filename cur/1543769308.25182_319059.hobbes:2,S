In all honesty - don't bother.  esd does the job better, faster, more
flexibly, and without the hassle.
I have spent many hours attempting to get a usable dmix setup working
and I just don't think its possible (at least not with my hardware).
I use esd for all "consumer" level audio apps, and jackd for all
professional audio apps.  This is by far the simplest way to manage
audio - I wouldn't waste your time with dmix.  After all, what could
you do with dmix that you can't do with esd??
