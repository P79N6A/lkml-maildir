Hi all
I just created a RAID0-reiserfs filesystem to hold /tmp (I expect to
have some increased performance since my rootfs is on a LVM/RAID5
array). The problem (althrough I can easily override it) is whenever the
new fs is mounted, all permissions on /tmp are overriden (I double
checked on mount options and there seems no option is provided for
mountpoint permissions). So what I get is:
dwarf:~# ls -ld /tmp
drwxrwxrwt    8 root     root          336 Dez 22 14:55 /tmp
dwarf:~# mount /dev/RAID0VOL/TEMP /tmp
dwarf:~# ls -ld /tmp
drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root           48 Dez 22 14:45 /tmp
Shouldn't mount preserve original mountpoint permissions ?
