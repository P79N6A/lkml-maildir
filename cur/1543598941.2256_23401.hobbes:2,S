That's a completely separate issue. You can fix it while keeping sane 
semantics for min() and max().
#define real_min(x,y) ({ typeof((x)) _x = (x); typeof((y)) _y = (y); (_x>_y)?_y:_x; })
#define min(x,y) ({ if strcmp(STRINGIFY(typeof(x)), STRINGIFY(typeof(y))) BUG(); realmin(x,y) }) 
/me wonders if gcc would manage to optimise that.
