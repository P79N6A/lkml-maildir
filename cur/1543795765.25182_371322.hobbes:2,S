Apparently it's a race between deleting a process and accessing its
/proc/pid entries. It came out in pidof while it was accessing
/proc/pid/stat (fs/proc/array.c:do_task_stat crashed on first
instruction - it was an inline function accessing task->state,
get_task_state IIRC). oops (with vserver history data - I'm using a
patch mentioned below) is attached.

I managed to reproduce it (although not reliably) during high CPU load
and I/O (parallel kernel compiles) on SMP systems with the vserver
patch (
http://linux-vserver.org
, the exact patch is
http://vserver.13thfloor.at/Experimental/patch-2.6.14.2-vs2.1.0-rc8.diff
),
but the vserver maintainer pointed out that it probably is a mainline
issue. We're not using 2.6 systems too much except for the vserver
test beds so I cannot tell if it happens on vanilla kernels.

I'm not a kernel guru so it's just my proposal. Can it break anything?
An alternative _might_ be somewhat coarser task_struct locking
(do_task_stat grabs a spinlock but then it's already too late).
However, if no "right" solution appears, I'll keep using my two-liner
because it seems to help, at least in my setup.
