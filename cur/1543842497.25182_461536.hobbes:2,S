With kmail, you have control over line breaks with Option -> Wrap lines, 
which is useful for e.g. pasted syslog data, but remember to enable it 
before writing the message, since you have to manually add line breaks 
for the entered text too.
Inlined patches should be added via Message -> Insert File to preserve 
line breaks and white space.
