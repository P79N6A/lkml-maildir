I hope the following comments aren't too far off target.
I too am inclined to prefer the __GFP_CRITICAL approach over this.
That or Andrea's suggestion, which except for a free hook, was entirely
outside of the page_alloc.c code paths.  Or Alan's suggested revival
of the old code to drop non-critical network patches in duress.
I am tempted to think you've taken an approach that raised some
substantial looking issues:
 * how to tell the system when to use the emergency pool
 * this doesn't really solve the problem (network can still starve)
 * it wastes memory most of the time
 * it doesn't really improve on GFP_ATOMIC
and just added another substantial looking issue:
 * it entwines another thread of complexity and performance costs
   into the important memory allocation code path.
Progress in the wrong direction ;).

Cpusets is about performance, not correctness.  Anytime I get cornered
in the cpuset code, I prefer violating the cpuset containment, over
serious system failure.
