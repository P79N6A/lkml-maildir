The "m" option is forced on, since the kernel does not have full
thread support. Threads look just like processes.
I'd like to fix this. At a very minimum, I need a way to identify
tasks that share address space. This is poor though, since I would
have to make ps sort processes by default. I think ps should be
somewhat fast by default.
I'd really like the same /proc files as Solaris has. Then I could
quickly identify threads.
BTW, I'm also hoping for a /proc/*/tty "link" that points to the
tty device.
I'll get all this done in a few years if I don't get any help.
Anybody dislike waiting that long? Give it a shot.
