I'm not sure this is at all related to the case we're talking about - it 
doesn't matter whether the request_irq or pci_enable_device comes first 
as the device is pulling on the interrupt line before the driver is even 
loaded. To fix that I'd think you'd need some kind of PCI quirk that 
would shut off the interrupt on the e100 card before any devices request 
the interrupt that it is sharing.
