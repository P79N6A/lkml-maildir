That was expected. I explicitly asked to add "noapictimer" to the kernel
command line.
Ok, so we ruled out the apic timer calibration routine. I did not expect
that this would be the culprit, but with "dark screen" as the only debug
info, I need to resort to small steps.
Can you please send me the output of /proc/timer_list of 2.6.23-rc7-hrt1
after booting with "noapictimer" ?
I'm a bit confused by your earlier confirmation, that mainline w/o the
-hrt patches boots fine, when you add "apicmaintimer" to the kernel
command line. "apicmaintimer" stops the PIT like we do in -hrt and we
just use the local APIC timer for everything. Can you please retest and
confirm that this is correct ?
Is the 32 bit kernel working on that box ?
Thanks for your patience.

PS: I just sent out the "disable APIC timer for AMD C1E boxen" patch. We
debugged this half a year ago on a nx6325, but I completely forgot about
that. The explanation from AMD was sensible, but your "apicmaintimer"
works statement is contradictory.
