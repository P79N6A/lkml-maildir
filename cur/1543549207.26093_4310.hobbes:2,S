Well, I'm not Linus (thank $DEITY for that; in that case, Linux would've
been an operating-system for the C=64...), but imho it would be cool if
we for once managed to release a v2.4.0 which actually managed to build
at least for some configurations on each platform. Oh, and I do firmly
believe that the S390 would be pretty non-critical to change, as it's
a new platform anyway, and the userbase is probably not that large yet
(hopefully it will become!)
As for me, I'm content as long as MCA-support and MPC7400 support works
properly for respectively x86 and PPC...
