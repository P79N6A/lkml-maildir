  -N? What's in a name? I suppose, it's not so important.
  (Arrays are identified by their UUID anyway. But maybe
  udev can do something with the name someday as it does
  today with /dev/disk/*.)
  -b internal -- seems like a good idea to speed up
  resynchronization.
  -e 1.0 -- I wonder why the new superblock format is
  not default in mdadm (0.90 is still used).
