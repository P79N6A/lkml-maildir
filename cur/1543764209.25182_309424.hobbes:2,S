Nice :)
Ok, here are the results of my tests with 2.6.12-rc2 and the patches
you sent me applied:
- plug USB device, sleep, unplug USB device, resume: no more oops
- sleep, plug in USB device: no oops, but it wakes the laptop up for a
few seconds; then, it goes back to sleep. No oops on second resume. I
can live with that :)
- once out of two resumes, resume leaves the ports unpowered; so I still
need my usb-ehci-power.patch that re-powers ports unconditionnaly.
