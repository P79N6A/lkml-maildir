[build error]
    Okay, this looks like it's a problem with the transition to
kconfig.  I have ext3 built in and ext2 built as a module, but
CONFIG_FS_MBCACHE=m.  So the problem would be this bit, right?
# Meta block cache for Extended Attributes (ext2/ext3)
config FS_MBCACHE
       tristate
       depends on EXT2_FS_XATTR || EXT3_FS_XATTR
       default m if EXT2_FS=m || EXT3_FS=m
       default y if EXT2_FS=y || EXT3_FS=y
    Which looks right -- it depends on either ext2 or ext3, and needs
to be built in if either of ext2 or ext3 are, but if both are modular
(or one is modular and the other is not built) then FS_MBCACHE should
be modular.  But it doesn't work.
