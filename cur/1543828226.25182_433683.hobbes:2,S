Btw, one thing that I was planning to ask people - does anybody find the 
full-format ChangeLog's that I produce at all useful?
You can get the exact same information directly from git, and the full 
changelog (as opposed to the shortlog) tends to be pretty rough to read, 
so I suspect that most people who do want to delve into the details are 
actually much more likely to look it up using git instead (at which point 
you can obviously get much better information - graphical history, diffs, 
etc)
I'm not going to stop doing the incremental shortlogs, since those are 
easy to read and I usually post them with the release announcement unless 
they end up being too large (usually -rc1 has a _lot_ of changes as a 
result of the merge window), but I'm just wondering if anybody finds the 
full logs useful at all?
They're easy for me to generate, but if nobody uses them, I don't see much 
of a point..
