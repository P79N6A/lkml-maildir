It's still alive. I'll make a 2.4.20 version of the patch once 2.4.20
is released. Or maybe earlier (a -rc version) since 2.4.20 appears to
be imminent and I don't expect changes in that area. 2.5.latest is next
on my list. Latest version is:
http://web.inter.nl.net/users/fvm/nfs-ngroups/2.4.19-nfs-ngroups-3.98.patch
I have dropped all the older versions (they go back to 2.2.13)
