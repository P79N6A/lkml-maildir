Sure, but you snipped the other part of the argument :)  Printing stuff 
only once is changes the format which has previously been to print out 
the same fields [but not necessarily the same values] for each CPU; so 
the alternative is to create /proc/global_cpu_info just to print out 
num-siblings only once :)  IOW, I don't see it as a big deal to print 
out the duplicated info, because that maintains the other assumptions 
about output format.
That said, on IRC my preference was to create smp_num_siblings[] and 
store the info per-cpu.  But right now that's only for software 
engineering masturbation :) since it would store the same value N times 
on current CPUs.
