Og course NOT: ``..'' is a meta syntax for ellipsis. I couldn't 
remember the inode number.

I did that, and actually it fixed the very same problem again. On a 
second run it was fixed. So either the "-a -t ext2" prevents the 
changes from being written back if the only problem was that special 
file, or there is some corruption undetected by fsck that in turn 
causes the kernel to corrupt the filesystem again and again, or I don't 
know. Here's the log from my tries:
elf:~ # fsck -f /dev/sda6

I'll keep your message. Maybe you hear again from me.
