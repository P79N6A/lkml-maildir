Note: rmap chains can be restricted to an arbitrary length, or an
arbitrary total count trivially. All you have to do is allow a fixed
limit on the number of people who can map a page simultaneously.
The selection of which chain to unmap can be a bit tricky but is
relatively straight forward.  Why doesn't someone who is seeing
this just hack this up?
