Why does everyone insist on it's skipping?!?!  It's dragging.  Remember
8track tapes?!?!
I'm sure it's hardware related because that machine has never done this when
it was primary.  Not with scsi or ide.  I used to run a 540mb wdc (which now
has a 420mb wdc) and it never once dragged due to writing or reading.
It would however drag when network activity went pretty high, it was a
conflict between the nic and the usb (which can't be disabled).

There's nothing wrong with the hardware itself.  When it ran 2.0.3x I never
had a problem except when there was network activity.  The problem went away
when I got a PCI sound card.  I kept the old sb16 for other things (lots of
programs didn't like the es1370 driver and the sb16 worked just fine).  The
16 would drag, but not the pci card.  Now, the machine was upgraded and the
old parts upgraded another machine.  I threw a sb card in it so that I could
play deathmatch games between me and friends with sound.
But the bottom line is, it's not skipping period.  It drags just like the
old 8tracks.  When the machine gets taken down (which may not be for a long
time, it's on a ups and I don't reboot machines unless I do upgrades, this
is a nonissue for the machine)
