Subject: [RFC] Time for a linux-kvm mailing list?
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/2/17/188

There doesn't seem to be a great place for KVM user questions, this is 
it, and kvm-devel seems a poor place for user questions, while the chat 
room is real time and depends on the question and the answer being in 
the same place at the same time.
Just a thought on getting a dialogue going in the right place.
