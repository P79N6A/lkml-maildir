Indeed. Plus if you add pci32 zone, it'll be needed for it too on
x86-64, like for the normal zone on x86, since ptes will go in highmem
while pci32 allocations will not. So while floppy might be fixed, this
issue would be for brand new pci32 zone needed by some device (i.e.
nvidia, so not such a unlikely corner case).
