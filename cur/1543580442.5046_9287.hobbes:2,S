Hi,
Can someone 'translate' this for me ?
Jan 31 18:01:57 base kernel: EXT2-fs error (device ide0(3,71)):
ext2_new_inode:
reserved inode or inode > inodes count - block_group = 0,inode=1
It's reproducable, but doesn't seem to give any problems.
It happens when on a (almost) emty FS an links is attempted to a directory
that doesn't exist at that point.
I'll try 2.4.1 when I get back and see what that does..
	Regards,
		Igmar
