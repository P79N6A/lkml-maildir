hi,
i was looking at the code of Floppy Driver by Linus, i was wondering the way
it has been coded !! even Linus has accepted that it can be further improved
a lot. i am thinking of making it more multithreaded, trying to find out the
details. any help on it would be highly appreciated.
thanx in advance.
Best Regards,
rajiv.
