Out of curiosity, adopted by popular acclaim, or because an 800 pound gorilla
said "This is the format we're shipping <XYZ> in, learn to deal with it"?
(I've seen both happen multiple times in the last quarter century, on many
different operating systems....)
(For that matter, all of my production boxes are backed up by either Tivoli or
Legato, and I haven't a *clue* what format those tapes are in.  As a practical
matter, it doesn't really matter - after the first quarter petabyte or so of
backed up data, you're not going to do a restore without the software's help
anyhow.. ;)
