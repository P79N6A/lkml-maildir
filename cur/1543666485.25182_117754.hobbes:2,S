Not really, it's actually more simple to what Larry is currently offering. 
A simply SCCS to RCS converter would be enough. Merging information is 
easy to add as well. If you now also add a sequence number is quite simple 
to modify a CVS server which can export the data reliably.

If you want to test an alternative system to see whether it's usable for 
kernel development, what better data is there? How could you compare it 
against bk?
