Hi !
Well, yesterday I've noticed the same problem here on an Asus A7M266-D. I
haven't had time to test every previous version, but I've searched through the
archives, and other similar reports have been posted since December. I believe
that some people did have it with 2.4.21pre2 too.
Your report narrows the problem down to fewer releases than what I saw first,
and if I have time I'll test 2.4.20 and 2.4.21pre1 here.
BTW, I don't know if -ac exhibits the same problem. Alan, would you check your
SMP box, please ?
Cheers,
Willy
