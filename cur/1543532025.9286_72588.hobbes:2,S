Funny you should say that :-) In fact, one of the things I'm planning
to do is put in a "physical physical" heirarchy for things like SCSI
cards. So, for example, where now there is a directory /dev/scsi/host0
it will be replaced by a symlink to /dev/bus/pci/slot0/function0
or something like that.
This doesn't help with network devices, though. It's one thing to
create the heirarchy, but since network devices have no device
entries, making use of this for network configuration isn't so easy.
Then again, maybe we should change to having device interfaces for
network devices, rather than these things which exist in a separate
namespace. I've often toyed with the idea. This might be a good reason
to actually do it.
There would of course be a directory with interfaces: /dev/net/ or
something like that. It would be populated with symlinks to the real
device nodes.
