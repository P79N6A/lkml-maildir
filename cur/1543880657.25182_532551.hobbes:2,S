yes, its a  cute idea, till you switch away from that screen to check progress 
on something else, like to compose this message.

The over 2000fps reports were while I was either looking at htop, or starting 
this message, both on different screens.  htop said it was using 95+ % of the 
cpu even when its display was going to /dev/null.  So 'Kewl' doesn't seem to 
get us apples to apples numbers we can go to the window and bet 
win-place-show based on them alone.
FWIW, running the nvidia-9755 drivers here.
So if we are going to use that as a judgement operator, it obviously needs 
some intelligently applied scaling before they are worth more than a 
subjective feel is.
