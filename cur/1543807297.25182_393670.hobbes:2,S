Ah, sorry about that, I forgot to verify the NUMA case. The problem is
that to kmalloc_node() is calling cache_alloc() now which is forced
inline. I am wondering, would it be ok to make __cache_alloc()
non-inline for NUMA? The relevant numbers are:
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
  15882    2512      24   18418    47f2 mm/slab.o (original)
  16029    2512      24   18565    4885 mm/slab.o (inline)
  15798    2512      24   18334    479e mm/slab.o (non-inline)
