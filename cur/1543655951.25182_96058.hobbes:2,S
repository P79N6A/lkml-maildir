Hi all
 I have an Asus S8600. 
 Mobile PIII 800Mhz + 192M RAM.
 If i select "Local APIC support on uniprocessors" the kernel while booting 
says there's no APIC present.Why?
 I know the same problem with some other laptops.
 Others detect it.
 At home my Athlon Tunderbird + Asus A7V133-C with local APIC enabled detects 
it but doesn seem to use it ... 
 cat /proc/interrupts
           CPU0
  0:     375529          XT-PIC  timer
  1:       7452          XT-PIC  keyboard
  2:          0          XT-PIC  cascade
  5:     113246          XT-PIC  bttv, eth0

 15:         12          XT-PIC  ide1
NMI:          0
ERR:          0
Anyway why do I need local APIC :) ?What are the advantages?Links?
Thank you very much for your kindness
 Best Regards,
