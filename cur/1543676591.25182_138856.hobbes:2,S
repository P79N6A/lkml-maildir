	This is a very common misconception. No, the point of 'select' is to hint
to you when you should attempt a non-blocking socket operation. It has never
been the case that 'select' guaranteed that a following blocking operation
wouldn't block.

	No. A 'write' hit from 'select' cannot guarantee that any arbitrary 'write'
won't block unless the following 'write' is non-blocking.
	Consider a TCP connection. I get a 'write' hit, and then I call 'write' to
send 250Kb of data. Do you seriously want to argue that the kernel must
somehow handle that 250Kb without blocking?

	No, it's more complicated in many situations. Suppose the kernel says a
connected UDP socket won't block because the network interface the packet
would go out is unused. Before you can call 'send', the interface goes down
and the packet now has to take a congested network interface. The 'write'
will block.

	Sure, but you can't ensure this in all cases unless you set the socket
non-blocking. The kernel can't guarantee the future and it has no way of
knowing that it's important to the application that the following operation
not block unless yuo tell it.

	Only if the application foolishly insists. For UDP, you should treat EAGAIN
as a hint that you're sending too fast. With UDP, the application is
responsible for send timing and can't foist this responsibility on the OS by
misusing 'select'.

	It cannot be made so without other greater losses. The perfect is the enemy
of the good. Use it as a hint.
