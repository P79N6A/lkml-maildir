shinybook /shiny/git/olpc-2.6 $ ls /dev/tty[a-zA-Z]* 
/dev/ttyPZ0  /dev/ttyPZ1  /dev/ttyS0  /dev/ttyS1  /dev/ttyS2  /dev/ttyS3
If you have dialler programs which can't manage to show you the existing
serial ports, file bugs. Especially if they don't let you type device
nodes into them. Sounds like kppp wouldn't let you use USB serial ports
either -- or phones connected directly via USB.
