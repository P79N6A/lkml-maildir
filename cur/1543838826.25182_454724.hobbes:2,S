udev will not create stable names for a bunch of things... at least not
with the default config that comes with distros. On my shuttle with the
built-in USB card reader, whatever config comes up with the box will
cause the machine to boot or fail to boot due to sda not beeing what
it's expected to be, and udev is of no help because it won't create
stable device names. Yes, I'm confident it _can_ be configured to do so.
It generally is not.
fbdev's also come to mind etc...
It's mostly a distro problem at this point...
Ben.
