Let me get this straight (before I jump out to eggheads and buy the wrong
thing).
- Which kind of media does Linux read?
- Which kinds of media does Linux write, and in what formats?
- cdrecords always tells me about "Starting to write CD/DVD...(etc)" -
  does that mean that I don't have direct write access to the media, but
  have to create an image file and burn it like a CD?
- Can it serve as short-term backup media (for constantly changing data)
  (but big size files, so CDs are not an option)?
Thanks!
