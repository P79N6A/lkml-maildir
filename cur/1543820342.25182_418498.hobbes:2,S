We should probably return 0/-1 in such case (-1 = on, but voltage unknown).

I'd say that AC status should go to separate class, I'm
afraid. Potentially AC has more parameters (like current, current
frequency, difference between phase of current and voltage, ...?) and
UPSs even measure that.
Does userspace need to be notified of suspend/resume? [I keep
insisting that they do not, and I'm probably wrong, but... :-)]
