Like I wrote earlier: as long as the notifier doesn't unregister itself
the critical RCU section for the list walk is only a small part of notifier_call_chain.
It's basically a stable anchor in the list that won't change.
The only change needed would be to make these parts unpreemptable and of course
add a RCU step during unregistration.
