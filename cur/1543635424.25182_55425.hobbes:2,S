well - firstly, I'm using _1_ gig of memory - highmem (= 900 megs something)
secondly - I have reproduced it on two different installations, although on 
the same hardware - standard PC with SiS MB and an extra promise controller, 
RAID-0 on 4 drives and chunksize 1MB. Given a 30-50 processes each reading a 
4gig file and sending it over HTTP, everything works fine _if_ and only _if_ 
the client reads at high speed. If, however, the client reads at normal 
streaming speed (4,3Mbps), buffers go bOOM.

Is there _any_ more data I can give, or any more testing I can do, then I'll 
do my very best to help
