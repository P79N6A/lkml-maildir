Unless he just booted, I would expect at least a little use of the swap, 
something like this, on a machine with 1GB RAM and not much happening. 
It's burning in with setiathome, and I played a few mp3s, and it seemed 
to feel the need for swap. I see similar on a box with 4GB, it never 
comes close to low memory, but still uses a few MB swap.

Not that this is a bad thing, but I'm surprised at no swap used at all.
