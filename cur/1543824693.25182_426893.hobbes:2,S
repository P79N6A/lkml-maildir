Oh dear.
Whatever we do here should remain 100%-compatible with "before".  Which
rather limits our options.

Generally we use file descriptors (and driver-specific state at
file.f_private) to manage things like that.  But I'd imagine that we
couldn't retain the existing semantics with any such scheme.
A pragmatic approach would be to put a big fat comment in there explaining
how it all works and leave it at that.
