The idea of extending aio_*() to include sendfile() is good,
but I'm not sure you'd want to do that with aio_write(), or
for that matter extend aiocb with extra fields. For example,
if aio_buf were NULL in an erroneous program, then with
the proposed modifications it might do wierd things, esp.
if aio_filedes2 wasn't used in that program and happend to
contain a valid file descriptor; without the proposed
modification, the program would have generated a EFAULT.
Instead, may I suggest aio_sendfile(aiocb, int outfd, int outoffset),
where aiocb defines the "input" & the outfd/offset define the "output".
We need an aiocb to support aio_error(), aio_return(),
aio_suspend(), etc ... to provide a handle to the request in progress.
