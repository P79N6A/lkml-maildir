Hi folks,
after a long time, I tried to upgrade the kernel I use to boot some
diskless PIII Katmai, C-PCI hosts (attached lspci -vv) with DEC ethernet
chips.
I had trouble to use "IP auto configure" feature... It seems like it is
skipped; even more, net/core/dev.c:net_dev_init() call by
drivers/block/genhd.c:device_setup() is never called.
I remember that:
1) the IDE hd scan was done, with no devices found (it is diskless:-)
2) the net device driver was started, and it found 2 DEC chips
but a few lines later NFS root couldn't be mounted as no NFS server was
set... anyway I had activated debug stuff in ipconfig.c and put a lot
of printk/console_print in dev.c and none of them was displayed so I guess
that code was never called actually.
then I added a bunch of printk/console_print in device_setup(), especially
before blk_dev_init
-------------------------------------------
#ifdef CONFIG_PARPORT
	parport_init();
#endif
	chr_dev_init();
	console_print("before blk_dev_init()\n");
	blk_dev_init();
	sti();
#ifdef CONFIG_I2O
	i2o_init();
#endif
#ifdef CONFIG_BLK_DEV_DAC960
	DAC960_Initialize();
#endif
#ifdef CONFIG_FC4_SOC
	/* This has to be done before scsi_dev_init */
	soc_probe();
#endif
#ifdef CONFIG_SCSI
	console_print("before scsi_dev_init()\n");
	scsi_dev_init();
#endif
#ifdef CONFIG_BLK_CPQ_DA
	cpqarray_init();
#endif
#ifdef CONFIG_BLK_CPQ_CISS_DA
        cciss_init();
#endif
#ifdef CONFIG_NET
	console_print("before net_dev_init()\n");
	net_dev_init();
#endif
------------------------------------------------
(I used console_print as I was scared it could mess with irq by the sti()
code...)
and all of a sudded it was all ok, I got all the printk/console_print...etc.
I got NFS root mounting... everything OK!
hope it is useful to you.
ciao
