   The reason we change the prefix length  from /10 to /64 is
   following spec and adapting other imprementations.
I think Derek's explanation shows that the specification
allows the /10 behavior.
Also, I suspect that since Derek works for Cisco, some "other
implementations" behave how he describes. :-)
