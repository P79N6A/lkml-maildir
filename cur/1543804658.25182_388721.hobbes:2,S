Sorry i missed this while posting the other patch. There are other functions 
called by process_zones() from withing pageset_cpuup_callback() that
are also marked __meminit. I sent a patch just now to cover that.
but as i mentioned i still have trouble getting cpuup to work right.
cpu_down() seems to work ok so far.
