Well it shouldn't be hard to make cryptd per-cpu.

That's actually bad because the system events queue is a shared
resource which is often subject to starvation problems.  On the
one hand we may be starved by others and we may also starve others
by doing too much crypto.

Not at all, tfms are just "shell" objects and they were designed
to be used in thie way.  Calling setkey twice is an issue but it's
not a show-stopper.  We have the same problem in other places to
so this something that we can potentially optimise.
