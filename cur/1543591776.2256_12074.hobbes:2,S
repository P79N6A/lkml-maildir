It may have several. Which one?
FWIW, I think that mixing network and device ioctls is a bad idea. These
groups are very different and we'd be better off dealing with changes in
them separately.
For devices... I'd say that fpath(2) (same type as getcwd(2)) would be
a good way to deal with that. Or fpath(3) - implemented via readlink(2)
on /proc/self/fd/<n>.
