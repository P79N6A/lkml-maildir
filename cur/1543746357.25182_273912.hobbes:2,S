I had one of those once..never got it to work.  If you can get
a new card, I'd suggest a p430tx or a 4-port Intel pro/1000
GigE NIC.  (The latter is 'only' $400 or so.)
If you can find an old DFE 570tx Dlink 4-port NIC those work
good too..but are discontinued for several years now.
Be careful about cheap Intel pro/100 4-port NICs..there are some
that will not negotiate link correctly.
