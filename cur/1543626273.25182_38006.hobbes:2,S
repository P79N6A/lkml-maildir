This problem seems not to be limited to ia32: on my DEC UDB AXP-box (on which I
never tried 2.4.x so far), lspci shows:
| 00:06.0 Non-VGA unclassified device: Symbios Logic Inc. (formerly NCR) 53c810 (rev 01)
|	Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 255, IRQ 11
|	I/O ports at 8000
|	Memory at 0000000004200000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable)
