This reminds me of another slightly annoying issue.  At least for
toolchains, Documentation/Changes works poorly for !i386.  How about we
try and take care of things like this in <linux/compiler.h> ?
Eg:
#if defined(CONFIG_SPARC) || defined(CONFIG_SPARC64)
...  egcs 1.1.2 check ...
#define __func__ __FUNCTION__
#endif
#if defined(CONFIG_X86) || ...
... gcc-2.95.3 check ...
#endif
Or not, I'm not really sure..
