    Moreover, it was somewhat incorrect from the very start since 'unsigned 
long' is 64-bit on 64-bit machines, and cycles_t is 'unsigned long' on both 
PPC32 and PPC64, so else branch would've *never* be executed...

    Yeah, I've looked at 2.6.19-rt2 and saw the new approach. But what's left 
to fix there, only the case of using PPC32 raw cycles? I guess you only need 
to cast a result of get_cycles() to cycle_t... wait, it'll be explicitly cast 
in the return stmt, won't it?
