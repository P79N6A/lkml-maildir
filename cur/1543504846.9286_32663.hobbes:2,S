Relatively sure.  Pings and UDP packets originating from the the
gateway work as expected, as do all packets originating from a
masqueraded box.  I've done all the usual cycling of the interface
and modem while debugging anyway.

ppp 2.3.7 - a relatively stock RH6 setup at the moment.

I believe they already are, but I'll double check that my current
scripts still do that when I'm home this evening.

Actually already have that in there - left over from a previous ISP
where it was actually necessary.  
I also have been running masqueraded boxes for awhile - since around
1996 or so.  This is the first time I've seen this type of problem. 
Switched to the 2.2.x kernels when they came out, and didn't have
any such problems for several months.  I will try to back down to
the earlier 2.2.x kernels as a test, though, and try one of the
later 2.3.x kernels just for completeness.
Thanks for the response anyway,
Dan
