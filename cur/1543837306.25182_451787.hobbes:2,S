I've had this laptop running for a couple of months without shutting down
and it doesn't have a problem.  The only time that I do shut it down is
when I'm working on site (which I'm doing now). So I only shutdown the
laptop while traveling.  When I came across suspend2 (and later swsusp), I
was excited that I didn't need to restart all my applications when leaving
the place of work and coming back.  But After being on site for several
days, and using the suspend to disk, I get a hot CPU. But when I've been
on site while shutting down normally when I leave then I don't have a
problem.

agreed, but you never know ;)  This laptop is currently my lifeline :)

I'm running after a poweroff (left it running over night in the hotel, and
I'm still in the hotel).
$ grep . /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THRM/*
/proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THRM/cooling_mode:<setting not supported>
/proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THRM/cooling_mode:cooling mode: passive
/proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THRM/polling_frequency:<polling disabled>
/proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THRM/state:state:                   ok
/proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THRM/temperature:temperature:             48 C
/proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THRM/trip_points:critical (S5):           88 C
/proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THRM/trip_points:passive:                 81 C: tc1=4 tc2=3 tsp=100 devices=0xcf6c2338
Note thermal_zone/THRM was finished with bash tab completion so they are
the only things that match the above glob expr.

I guess not.

No idea.
It does look like something isn't setting up the ACPI power properly on
resume, and that the CPU is probably in a busy loop while the machine is
idle.  Just a guess.
Thanks for the support,
