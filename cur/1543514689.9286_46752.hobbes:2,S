Hear hear. Same problem here. Abit wasn't able to help.

I have hangs with all recent 2.2 kernels and some 2.3 kernels.

Yes. Try getting the newest unofficial beta BIOS for the BP6 from
http://www.bp6.com/files
 and try that. I have been running stable with
that BIOS for a week+ now. However, I have also been running 2
threaded-RC5 so I can't tell for sure which one contributes to the
machine no longer hanging. I'll have to wait and see.
