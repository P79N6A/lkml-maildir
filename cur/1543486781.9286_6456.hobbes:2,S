One thing you might try is only allow directories to be linked if
the new links are at the same distance from the root.   While this
would limit the usefulness of the hard linked directories it would
help with `chroot'.  An example would be if you wanted to chroot
users into their home directories.  You create: 
/home/skel/usr/bin
              /lib
	      /etc
and then you could run 
  ln /home/skel/usr/ into /home/gam3/usr/
  ln /home/skel/usr/ into /home/ann/usr/
This might make it so that NFS could only export from the root if you
have hard linked directories.
