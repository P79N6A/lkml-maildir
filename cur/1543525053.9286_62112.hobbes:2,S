Roughly speaking (that is, apart from some `protocol' scancodes)
showkey -s will show you everything the keyboard produces.
So, when showkey -s doesnt show anything that is because the
keyboard does not produce anything, and no kernel patch
will change that.
So, no doubt these keyboards must be initialized in some way,
unknown to me. If you have one, I suppose it would come
with software that makes it work, and you can trace the
software to see what it sends to the keyboard.
Most of what I know about keyboard scancodes can be found at
