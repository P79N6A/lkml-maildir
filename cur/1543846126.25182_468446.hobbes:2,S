At least some out-of-tree drivers seem to be able to do this.  For 
instance, these guys:

My assumption for bridging a bitstream is that timeslot sync is not 
absolutely critical.  However, IF
you could be sure of time-slot sync, you'd  have a lot more power and be 
able to do some extra ticks
in user-space I think...

The key for me is that if you ever miss a slot in bit-stream mode, you 
can never make it up because
every bit is critical.  This leads to having to drop arbitrary data to 
keep from ever-increasing latency on your
bridge.  With HDLC, you can skip the flags and make up time if you ever 
miss a timeslot (assuming the
HDLC is not using the line at 100% capacity.)

I'd be happy with a software approach.  In fact, if I could get a framed 
packet (ie, I know that
byte 0 is channel 1, byte 24 is channel 24, and byte 25 is channel 1 
again...) then I could even
do the multiplexing in user space.
For write, I'd also need to be able to guarantee that byte 0 goes to 
channel 1, etc.  So, if the
driver bit-stuffed, then it would need to do an entire time-slice at once.

Excellent.  I actually want to write the bridge logic myself in 
user-space..I just need the driver
API and at least one driver that supports it and has support for readily 
available T1/E1 hardware.
For future work, I'd be interested in the same sort of support for DS3/E3.
I'd be willing to fund development of these features if you or someone 
else is interested
(please contact me off list for details.)
Thanks,
Ben
