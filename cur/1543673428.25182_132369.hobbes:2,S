Well, using BK as of Friday last week I'm still having a complete
disaster of NFS support.  Copying a 13MB file within an NFS-mounted
directory usually yields an I/O error, creating that same file does too
(it's a final link, so I don't know offhand if reading the objects or
writing the binary is falling over).  Server is rather old now,
in-kernel NFSd from 2.4.19-pre10-ac2, but it works just fine on 2.4
clients.
