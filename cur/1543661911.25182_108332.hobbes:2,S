Hi all,
I need this patch to compile 2.5.59 with aironet support.
It seems that a patch from Ingo broke this driver early october 2002.
drivers/built-in.o(.text+0x3d19a): In function `awc_private_init':
: undefined reference to `awc_work'
make: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
I pulled 2.5 from bk to see if the patch was in already, and it is not.
Can you please apply this patch?
