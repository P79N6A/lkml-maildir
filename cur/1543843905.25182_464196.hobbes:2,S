Tell me, what happens if you leave that patch installed, and you use 
the patch I sent last week (the one that removes a chunk of code from 
ohci-hub.c), and you also set CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND?
I think the real underlying problem here is that David's implementation of 
root-hub suspend in ohci-hcd is incompatible with the overall scheme I've 
been working on.  In the end I'll probably have to rewrite the ohci-hcd 
code.
