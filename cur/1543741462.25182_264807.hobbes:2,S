Possibly we can consider some optimizations, such as a driver can
explicitly disable the 'pci record'. The main problem we encountered is
the correctness of suspend/resume.

Extend PCI config space is device specific, general code can't do it.

if all PCI devices and bridges have drivers, this could be fixed. But I
think it's far away. Another issue here is the hierarchy of devices. A
device in the below of device tree doesn't means it must be resumed
later. Such as a PCI IRQ router, it must resume before all PCI devices.

One case here is the ASL code will disable/enable EHCI per current OS
(such as disable EHCI if OS isn't win) in some systems. The
disable/enable bit is in ICH.
