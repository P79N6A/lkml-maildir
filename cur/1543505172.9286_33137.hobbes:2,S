They are.  Have you looked at the LS-120 drive?  It is also
called "Superdisk" I believe.  Also, there is the IOMEGA ZIP
disk.
The LS-120 disks are 120Mb each, and the ZIP is 100Mb each.
IOMEGA also makes drives called the JAZZ drive, which takes 1Gig
floppy cartridges similar to the ZIP drive.
There are many many more options on the market as well, and Linux
supports all of the above drives allready, and likely many more
that are on the market.

Do yourself a favour and invest in one of the newer drives that
are out there.  I've used a ZIP drive many times in Linux, and
they work well.
