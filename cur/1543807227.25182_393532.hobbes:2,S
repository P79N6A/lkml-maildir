 	do {
-		ret = file->f_op->aio_read(iocb, iocb->ki_buf,
-			iocb->ki_left, iocb->ki_pos);
+		struct iovec iov = {
+			.iov_base = iocb->ki_buf,
+			.iov_len = iocb->ki_left
+		};
+
+		ret = file->f_op->aio_read(iocb, &iov, 1, iocb->ki_pos);
this still has the lifetime problems Ben pointed out.  aio might still
be outstanding when this thread returned to userspace, so we need to
dynamically allocated the iovec and free it later.  (or make it part
of the iocb?)
