Yes, you're quite right about this. I had my mind obsessed all the day reducing
a bzImage to fit it on a diskette, and didn't immediately realise that other
people were speaking pure vmlinux in this discussion :-)
So I retried, and the difference in vmlinux between -fomit-frame-pointer and
-momit-leaf-frame-pointer is nearly 1 kB LESS for the last one (difference
in text only). So David was right here. Please also node that the code is
really less compressible because 1 kB less gives 4 kB more after compression.
Even after upx, the difference is still 3 kB between the two images.
Anyway, the compressed size is sometimes more relevant than the vmlinux one,
when it comes to put it on very limited devices such as diskettes. In my case,
I don't need this extra 1 kB ram, I prefer those 4 kB floppy image for another
NIC driver !
I haven't benchmarked anything with these options. Maybe David's suggestion
is interesting for userland where compression is rarely used.
Cheers,
Willy
