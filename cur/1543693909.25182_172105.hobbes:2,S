Yes, I think it makes sense to fix mincore().  I don't fully understand the
reasoning behind the three cases though:
+	if (pte_file(*pte))
+		present = mincore_linear_page(vma, pte_to_pgoff(*pte));
+	else if (!(vma->vm_flags | (VM_READ|VM_WRITE|VM_MAYREAD|VM_MAYWRITE)))
+		present = pte_present(*pte);
+	else
+		present = mincore_linear_page(vma, pgoff);
Could you explain the logic behind each of these?  Perhaps with permanent
comments?
