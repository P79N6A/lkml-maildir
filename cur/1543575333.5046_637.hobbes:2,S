Ignore that bit of the patch.  arch/i386/vmlinux.lds is generated from
arch/i386/vmlinux.lds.S and the latter is correctly patched.  The patch
for arch/i386/vmlinux.lds should not have been generated.
<rant size="small">
There are a lot of unnecessary inconsistencies between architectures.
Some archs generate vmlinux.lds from vmlinux.lds.S, some from
vmlinux.lds.in, some do not generate vmlinux.lds, it is shipped in the
tarball.  The inconsistencies make it difficult to distinguish between
files that are generated (not shipped, ignore for patching) and master
files (shipped in tar ball, check for patches).
There is a similar problem with oops text.  Each architecture needs an
oops report but each one prints it differently.
I implore architecture maintainers to adopt a common approach to
generated files, oops reports etc.  Remember that each arch needs to be
part of the common tar ball and has to operate with a single set of
make and other user space tools.
