For the moment I'm trying to fix the most buggy parts. The Lindent run is 
scheduled to be done last, it's too big and adds nothing if it would go into 
kernel for now. It won't even compile now, my tests are only compile tests 
done with the two #error commented out. That should prevent most users from 
using it without all patches applied. The rest either knows what he's doing 
and/or would get crashes anyway ;)
Next to come will be splitting up the ISR and then fixing the #errors. After 
this is might even work. :)

Give me some code and we can see...
Bolke, what kind of adapter do you have?
