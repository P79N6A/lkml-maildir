Hmm, do you know there is already zone-hotplug ? ;)
(Means, onlining new memory in new zone increase the # of zones.
 Now, in our system, possible-node turns to be online nodes.)

I agree that what is the best is based on benchmark.
I like per-node, now.
I believe there will be some change when RvR's spilit-LRU patches are applied.

I hear that there is also I/O bottle-neck for page reclaiming, at last.
