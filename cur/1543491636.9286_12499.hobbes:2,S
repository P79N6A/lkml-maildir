Hi,
I just compiled and installed kernel 2.2.5 on my Slackware box.  Everytime I 
shutdown now, it gives me the frightening sequence of messages: (I'm 
paraphrasing, I didn't think to write them down last time, and I'm not at my 
computer now.)
> Unmounting local file systems.
> umount: /dev/hda could not be unmounted or / is busy
> mount: / is busy, could not mount fs
> mount: (something else I can't recall)
> On next boot, fsck will be FORCED
then, upon reboot, after checking hardware (and autodetecting all my PCI 
devices - I love 2.2.x!)
>fsck: deleted inode (5-digit number, always [so far] starting with 40xxx) has 
zero dtime. Fix dtime? (system automatically answers yes, and it takes about 2 
minutes to recover from each inode found with this problem - one time, it 
found 5 inodes with bad dtimes, adding a full 10 minutes to my boot!)
then, we have unresolved symbols in just about every module installed, after 
which the next line is:
> kernel_version needed, but can't be found
then a couple more lines and:
> can't locate module slip
> can't locate module ppp
2 or 3 more lines, and:
> modprobe: out of file handle
> modprobe: out of file handle
> modprobe: can't locate module net-pf-4
> modprobe: out of file handle
> modprobe: out of file handle
> modprobe: can't locate module net-pf-5
> SIOCADDRT: Invalid argument
and then, at the end, the last line before the login prompt is:
> Cannot open /lib/modules/misc/iBCS.o
I'm pretty sure that I compiled the kernel correctly, I read all the READMEs 
and HOWTOs on the subjuect I could find first.  (It was a lot easier than I 
thought it would be once I actually got started.)  All the bad module errors 
make it look like I didn't make modules_install, but I did.  I have no clue 
what's going on.  I'm pretty sure this is a kernel issue, because that's the 
only thing that changed in my system before it startd doing this. (Actually, 
it was forcing fsck every boot anyway [not sure why], but not finding anything 
before 2.2.5)
If this is not a kernel ssue, or you're convinced I did something wrong 
installing the kernel, I apologize and humbly ask redirection.
If it is a kernel issue (and I'm pretty sure it is - it wasn't happening 
before, and I'm almost positive I did everything correctly), please help me 
figure out why my machine is going crazy.
Thanks.
