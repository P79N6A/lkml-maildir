Ah.  Others are working on providing a fix for this too, but it is being
done in the drivers themselves, not in the pci core.  Look in the
linux-pci mailing list archives for those patches (I don't think they
every went into mainline for some reason, but I might be wrong...)
I suggest you work with those developers, as they have the same issue
that you are trying to solve here.
