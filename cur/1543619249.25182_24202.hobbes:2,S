Here's the final resolution on this issue:
	fstab(5) now mentions "udf".
	mount(8) now has the key piece of information - "udf
	and iso9660 co-exist on many discs".
	mount -t auto now automounts udf.
	This required scanning the extended area as you can't
	tell from the first VSD.
Most people will never need to think about the issue again, dvd-rom's will
just mount.  Poof.
Thanks for the tips and pointers that helped identify the cause.
