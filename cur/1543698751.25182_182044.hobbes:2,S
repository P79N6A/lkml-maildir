Thanks for the info, Matthew.  Yes, clearly a scheme that keeps some "holes"
in compressed files can help; one of our ideas was to leave sparse holes
every N blocks, exactly for this kind of expansion, and to update the index
file's format to record where the spaces are (so we can efficiently
calculate how many holes we need to consume upon a new write).
Cheers,
Erez.
