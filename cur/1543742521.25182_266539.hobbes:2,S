I'm not going to post much more about this topic.
The contents of this describe the lack of any notice of the actual
licensing scheme of conexant/linuxant modems and their Linux drivers

Well, as I expected, after learning my mistake, I am being told I was in
the legal wrong.
Examine this:
I have a gentoo system.  I bought a used pci modem card.  Someone told
me to use the hcfpcimodem package for the drivers, cause it's of course
a piece of sh*t winmodem.  I ran:
emerge hcfpcimodem
I get something installed in non-standard places.  I can't find any
documentation.  It doesn't tell me ANYTHING upon install EXCEPT
something similar to: "run hcfpciconfig to install your modem"
I'm left thinking this is just another free package.
When I run hcfpciconfig, I'm told to enter my  kernel module build
directory name, my email address, and a license number or "FREE".  It
tells me that I need a license from linuxant to do fax, voice or
anything higher then 14.4k.
I do a search on the web for "linuxant license" and get keygen.pl.
I run keygen.pl and enter the key it gives me.
Upon questioning why I need a key, I strings the modules and see:
"license=GPL".  I continue on my merry way thinking everything is OK.
Now where have I gone wrong here?  And plus... when I go into the
standard directories for documentation: 
"/usr/man:/usr/share/man:/usr/info:/usr/share/info:/usr/share/doc"
I find nothing about hcfpcimodem or hcfpciconfig(1).  And I certainly
find no license file in any of those directories OR the
'/lib/modules/<kernel version>/misc' directory it places these magically
appearing binaries.
/usr/sbin/hcfpciconfig says:
# Copyright (c) 2003 Linuxant inc.
but there is no mention of where the license is or what kind of license
there is.  and its a sh script that, normally, is too arcane for one to
decipher.
Following all of this, does anyone have a clue what the licensing scheme
is of linuxant drivers?  there is no mention of anything except the
string "license=GPL" in the binaries.  
It upsets me that I have to pay TWICE for this modem.  Once for the
hardware and again for the driver.  sheeesh!
