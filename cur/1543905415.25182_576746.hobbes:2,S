Subject: [PATCH] Fix msr register allocation
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/30/149

Since the value in ret will go through a return statement,
it does not need to be put in eax register directly. Instead,
we let the compiler do his job and choose what to do with it,
potentially getting a better register allocation.
