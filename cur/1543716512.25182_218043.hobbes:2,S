I added entry to FAQ:
Q: My machine doesn't work with ACPI. How can I use swsusp than ?
A: Do reboot() syscall with right parameters. Warning: glibc gets in
its way, so check with strace:
reboot(LINUX_REBOOT_MAGIC1, LINUX_REBOOT_MAGIC2, 0xd000fce2)
Ouch, and when you code that trivial program, send me source, I lost
mine.
