Ok, so it would basically be:
init()
{
	clocksource *clock = clocksource_get_best_clock();
}
trace()
{
	trace.time = cyc2ns(clock, clocksource_read(clock));
}
This seems pretty sane to me. 
The blk-trace code calibrates a per cpu offset for the sched_clock()
time (see blk_trace_check_cpu_time and blk_trace_set_ht_offsets). Does
the clocksource stuff help me with this or would I still need to do
something like that?
I also noticed that you have a clocksource_get_masked_clock() call. This
seems like a pretty awkward API to me. The first thing that came to mind
when I read the name was 'what is a masked clock'. When I realized that
it meant 'a clock w/o this flag', I still found it awkward that one has
to specify what that don't want. e.g 'I don't want a clock that is not
continuous.'
It think it would be better if you had sometime like
'clocksource_get_clock_with_features()' that took flags describing the
needed characteristics instead of the unwanted ones.
e.g.
clocksource_get_clock_with_features(CLOCKSOURCE_STABLE)
or
clocksource_get_clock_with_features(CLOCKSOURCE_PM_UNAFFECTED)
instead of:
clocksource_get_clock_masked(CLOCKSOURCE_UNSTABLE)
clocksource_get_clock_masked(CLOCKSOURCE_PM_AFFECTED)
Especially awkward is the CLOCKSOURCE_64BIT flag, as there isn't really
anyway to specify that I want a 64bit timer, only a way to specify that
I don't.
It also isn't clear what the implications of some of the flags are:
e.g:
	NOT_CONTINUOUS - don't really have any idea what this means.
	UNSTABLE - this means the frequency can change right?
		Does PM_AFFECTED imply UNSTABLE?
	NOT_ATOMIC - does this affect me as user?
	PM_AFFECTED - it looks like the stp code deals with cpu speed
		changing. Does the clocksource code do this for me with
		cyc2ns?  If it does are there any reason I would want to
		avoid PM_AFFECTED clocks? If it doesn't how do I know
		that I need to correct it myself.
Hope this helps,
