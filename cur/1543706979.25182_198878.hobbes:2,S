Ideally the drive should do it automatically, and if it can't remap, 
it's run out of spare sectors to remap bad ones to (uh oh).
Really the best policy IMO is just to run 'e2fsck -c' every so often 
until you can get your data off this disk, and throw it in the garbage. 
  That does the "remapping" at the filesystem level, which is IMO easier 
than bothering with low-level ATA commands.
I'm a bit fuzzy on SMART and Device Configuration Overlay and need to 
review.  Those are sets of ATA commands, and they -might- allow you to 
remap at a low-level.  I know vendor-specific commands exist to do 
precisely what you want, but those are unfortunately NDA'd and I don't 
know them, just that they exist...
