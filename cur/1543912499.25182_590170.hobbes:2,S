port and it has implemented based on the multiport ID (MID) capability
on the switch.

Yes, NPIV is optional, if the switch is NPIV capable then you can create
virtual ports, otherwise it works as it does today. NPIV is a standard
technology that allows sharing a single physical Fabric port (N-port)
among multiple virtual fabric ports. Multiple ID(s) is a HBA feature
that allows multiple virtual Loop ID(s) on a public or private loop
topology.
