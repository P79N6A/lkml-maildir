Ah...that certainly makes sense...
Just to satisfy my curiosity, any idea exactly how the said bug hits?
There's obviously some part of the bzImage algorithm that's rather
susceptible, that's not in the zImage algorithm, but as I don't have
much idea how either algorithm works...
Best wishes from Riley.
