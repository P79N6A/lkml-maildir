It's also badly needed to make hugetlbfs NUMA policy aware. mbind
requires allocation on demand, because it runs after mmap and
cannot fix up the policy when the pages are already allocated.

I would like to have it. I remember hating to implement extending 
truncate by hand when I did the test programs for the hugetlbfs numa policy.
