Larry means that it's perfectly normal for libc to map the same file
more than once: you have the code section and the data section.
I don't know if ARM's ELF is like the x86, but on the x86 the final
partial page of code or read-only data will be mapped twice, as the
latter part of the page can contain writable data.  This avoids
wasting up to a page's worth of bytes in the ELF file.
