The help text says:
"This driver is a light version of i2c-parport.  It doesn't depend on
the parport driver, and uses direct I/O access instead."
So I think that the (lack of) dependencies is correct. We don't want to
force the user to select PARPORT (and built the parport driver) to get
access to the i2c-parport-light driver which does NOT need this parport
driver.
