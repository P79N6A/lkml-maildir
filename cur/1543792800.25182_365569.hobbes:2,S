Thanks a lot. Another question.
My interface is a virtual interface which represent a radio connected to 
the host using ethernet NIC. I designed my own L2 protocol on top of 
802.3, which must be used, since the radio and the host are connected by 
ethernet.
Now, my radio_hard_header will only add my L2 header, and my 
radio_hard_start_xmit will do (simplified):
1) ajust the headroom space
     hh_len = LL_RESERVED_SPACE(bdev);
     if (unlikely(skb_headroom(skb) < hh_len && bdev->hard_header)) {
		struct sk_buff *skb2;
		skb2 = skb_realloc_headroom(skb, LL_RESERVED_SPACE(dev));
		if (skb2 == NULL) {
             stats->tx_dropped++;
			dev_kfree_skb(skb);
			return 0;
		}
		if (skb->sk)
			skb_set_owner_w(skb2, skb->sk);
		dev_kfree_skb(skb);
		skb = skb2;
	}
2) call eth0->hard_header
3) skb->dev = eth0
    return dev_queue_xmit()
The problem is when system try to retransmit the packet, I add another 
ethernet header mistakenly.
I have two question:
1) I do not modify the skb passed to hard_start_xmit if 
skb_realloc_headroom is executed. only in this case the retransmission 
runs well. Is my understanding right?
2) Should I do this way or add the ethernet header in my 
radio_hard_header? If I choose the later, the problem will be how should 
I handle it when eth_hard_header return a negative number, when ARP is 
needed.
Thx
