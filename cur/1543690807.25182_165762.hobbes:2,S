FUD, Inc.  If these really did exist, they would be more commonly
known and I'm certain would affect customer choice.  IMHO, I think
this is the vendor's (and I specifically think of Red Hat) way of
excusing themselves from having to work with third party vendors
in order to cover themselves legally with groups like the FSF.
Whether that's true or not, or if there is some other developer
contingent at these distribution houses that is preventing the
EXPORT_SYMBOL{,GPL}() changes due to personal bias, I don't know.
And I doubt we'll ever know.
These letters are like WMD -- they exist, you know they do, but you
just can't find them. :)
