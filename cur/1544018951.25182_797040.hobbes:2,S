What is the purpose of your change? I'm not sure you understood the 
problem. The problem is not with work_on_cpu() usage. The problem is:
 1) holding locks while calling work_on_cpu()
 2) same locks being taken by a worklet used by some other code
work_on_cpu() really wants to serialize on its own workload only, not on 
the other stuff that might be sometimes be queued up in the keventd 
workqueue.

i'd expect there to be more as part of the cpumask stack reduction 
patches that Rusty and Mike are working on.
in any case it's a correctness issue: work_on_cpu() is a just as generic 
facility as on_each_cpu() - with the difference that it can handle 
blocking contexts too.
So if it's generic it ought to be implemented in a generic way - not a 
"dont use from any codepath that has a lock held that might occasionally 
also be held in a keventd worklet". (which is a totally unmaintainable 
proposition and which would just cause repeat bugs again and again.)
