Not that easy, alas :)  Save for weirdos like the mac drivers I 
highlighted, it seems like most drivers in the non-trivial already pass 
a useful pointer to request_irq().
But as I mentioned, most of the "non-trivial" uses are actually trivial 
-- just not as simple as removing the 'int irq' argument.  Most of the 
time the irq number is used in non-critical ways like printk's.  A few 
times its used to index into a structure (something dev_id could replace).
