I don't consider this a bug, but rather a conscious decision on the part of
the developers.  If you are trying to delete a directory and it has read
errors, then it is better to let the unlink succeed than to refuse to unlink
the directory.

What is more of a bug is a few lines down.  The error return from
ext3_check_dir_entry() causes the rest of the directory to be skipped and
"1" returned instead of skipping that block/page and continuing to check
the rest of the directory.  With this if there is a read error anywhere
in the directory it is possible to rmdir the directory without actually
deleting entries that are returned by ls.

Again a conscious decision.  If a name is potentially inaccessible because
of an IO error it is better to allow the creation of a potentially duplicate
name than refuse creation of any new entries in the directory.  It's a matter
of allowing the filesystem to be used as well as possible in the face of
failures vs. just giving up and refusing to do anything.
Cheers, Andreas
