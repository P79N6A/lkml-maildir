This (including your followup) does indeed avoid the traces in the 
kernel log, but unfortunately, the driver seems to need a bit more.
This may be expected, I'm not sure:
root@5va2:~# dd if=/dev/mcdx0 of=/dev/null bs=2048
0+0 records in
0+0 records out
0 bytes (0 B) copied, 0.000221955 seconds, 0.0 kB/s
root@5va2:~#
This I know isn't:
root@5va2:~# readcd dev=/dev/mcdx0 f=/dev/null
Segmentation fault
root@5va2:~#
(leaves a "note: readcd[1174] exited with preempt_count 1" in the log)
and after a "mount -t iso9660 /dev/mcdx0 /mnt/cdrom",  a:
root@5va2:~# tar cv /mnt/cdrom >/dev/null
has upto now done all of:
1) segfault
2) make the kernel oops
3) reset the machine
This thing is just so badly broken... ;-(
I've attached the current patches from Jens and yourself (against 
2.6.20.4) as a double check, but the driver's still totally unuseable 
even with them...
I own two other legacy drives; a Panasonic CR562 (sbpcd.c) and a Sony 
CDU33A (cdu31a.c) which together with this Mitsumi LU005S (mcdx.c) make 
up also all but one of the controllers I have; a few standalone, but 
most on old ISA soundcards. When I last tested, cdu31a somewhat worked 
and sbpcd didn't. Had high hopes for mcdx.c upon seeing it compile 
without warnings, but alas.
Last time Al Viro suggested ripping them out, I slightly objected:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2004/5/2/123
but well, although I like playing with this stuff, I still don't know 
the first thing about the block layer and given the shape these things 
are in...
Many thanks for looking though!
Rene.
