it does. See the refill_inactive pass.

It doesn't happen here.
At the very least the fix is the two liner from Andrew that forces a
nr_pages refile from active list, that will guarantee that whatever
happens we always roll the active list too, but the oom killing you are
experiencing is a problem of mainline, it definitely doesn't happen here
and the refill_inactive(0) cannot be the culprit because the active list
grows always to a relevant size and if during oom a few pages stays
untouched into the active list that's fine, those two pages couldn't
save us anyways so they'd better stay there so we don't trash.
