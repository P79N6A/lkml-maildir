Hm, this is an issue that I and the FreeBSD author of jail were talking
about a week or so ago when I was describing why we did udev in
userspace and the hotplug stuff.  He pointed out the namespace issue as
the biggest problem for FreeBSD to be able to do the same kind of thing
that we are doing.
But I agree, I don't think it's a big deal right now either.
