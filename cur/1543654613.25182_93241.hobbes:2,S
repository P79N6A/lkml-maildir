Alan's patch:
+ extern int sis_apic_bug;
will work; however, adding #include <asm/io_apic.h> will cause the
following on 2.5.50:
include/asm/mpspec.h:203: error: `NR_CPUS' undeclared here (not in a
function)
include/asm/io_apic.h:51: error: `MAX_IO_APICS' undeclared here (not in
a function)
include/asm/fixmap.h:49: error: `FIX_IO_APIC_BASE_0' used prior to
declaration.
Just wanted to be sure people applied the right patch.
Justin
