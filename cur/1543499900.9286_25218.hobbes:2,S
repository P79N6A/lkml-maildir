The SUS phrases this a lot more clearly for fdatasync
     * For write, when the operation has been completed or diagnosed if
       unsuccessful. The write is complete only when the data specified
       in the write request is successfully transferred and all file
       system information required to retrieve the data is successfully
       transferred.
