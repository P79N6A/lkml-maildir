Well pass it to them that I will be happy to fix their problems when it is
a Microsoft problem, but a double or triple the rate.  He needs to get
clue and see that the support contract he will be paying for will exceed
the cost of supporting what they are depend upon now under Linux.
I have no problems with people needed to learn lessons the hardware way
and if you send me his contact information, I will address it for you.
This will explain that he is needed support and that costs money;
regardless, of the OS and hardware.
