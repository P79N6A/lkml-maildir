It's a problem for uniprocessors as well.
Example:
#define current_cpu_data boot_cpu_data
#define pgd_quicklist (current_cpu_data.pgd_quick)
extern __inline__ void free_pgd_fast(pgd_t *pgd)
{
        *(unsigned long *)pgd = (unsigned long) pgd_quicklist;
        pgd_quicklist = (unsigned long *) pgd;
        pgtable_cache_size++;
}
Preemption could corrupt this list.
