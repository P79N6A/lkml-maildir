I think the question is:
	Can or should an administrative process be able to do things
	inside of a container, without being subject that that
	container's resource limitations?
Implementation wise, I'm sure we _can_ do something like that.  We
simply have to make sure that when processes are entering containers,
they are subject to the originating container's resource limits, not the
destination.
Could you explain why this is a security hole?
