Nope, only 1GB of RAM.

No, I haven't.  Like I mentioned above, the OpenBSD drivers seemed to work, 
or at least did with similar tests.  I would need to run the more extensive 
checks to be positive, but those take a lot of time, obviously.  And 
downtime for the box, a lot of which isn't really manageable, at the moment.

The previous motherboard was an AMD 760 chipset, and it had the same 
problem.

I can certainly try that - I admit 2.6.20.3 is a little old now.  This will 
probably take me a couple days - tomorrow is the 4th of July and a holiday 
for me.
