    I'm afraid that those use symlinks or hardlinks to run every
different personality. What my init does is more or less (no real
code):
    pid=fork();
    if (!pid) do_klog();
    ...
    pid=fork();
    if (!pid) do_slog();
    So, in function do_klog() we would like to change argv[0]. Things
like busybox and the like uses symlinks or mechanisms like 'command
subcommand'.
    I'll give a look at the microdistros, anyway :)) Thanks :)
