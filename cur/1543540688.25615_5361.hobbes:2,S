Subject: Enable extra checks in new queueing code?

I'm still trying to figure out why my machine oopses when the disks are
pushed hard.  I'm running the SCSI controller on the motherboard into an
external RAID module that has a 32MB buffer (I'll be upgrading the buffer
to 128MB tomorrow).
I'm looking through the config options for the 2.4.0-test5 kernel and I
see "Enable extra checks in new queueing code".  I did not have that
option enabled on the kernels that I had been oopsing.  Anyone think it'll
make a difference?
