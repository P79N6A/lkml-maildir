Alright, I'll add a single read function and keep the triple read
function around just in case. Maybe we can use some sort of dmi
blacklist to auto-detect known trouble cases.

The priority values may need some tweaking. The acpi-pm timesource is
really useful on laptops that have cpufreq issues, so it has been a
higher priority then the TSC in i386 for awhile. 
How about something like this?
300 TSC 
200 HPET
200 CYCLONE
100 ACPI
050 PIT
010 JIFFIES
Then if the system has TSC issues (unsynced, cpufreq problems, etc), we
can demote the TSC's priority to 50 and it will fall back nicely without
manual intervention.
