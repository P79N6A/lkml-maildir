Subject: [patch 6/6][RFC] Drop CAP_SYS_RAWIO requirement on FIBMAP
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/26/532

Remove the need for having CAP_SYS_RAWIO when doing a FIBMAP call on an open file descriptor.
It would be nice to allow users to have permission to see where their data is landing on disk, and there really isn't a good reason to keep them from getting at this information.
