Looking at BIOS disassembly:
2F97: push bp
2F98: mov bp,sp
2F9A: add sp,-2
2F9D: mov [bp][-2],bx    <-- it oopses here
I realized that I can modify the BIOS easily as it's stored in shadow RAM. So 
I replaced the offending MOV with three NOPs and tested again. This time it 
oopsed at 0x2FAD:
2FAD: cmp w,[bp][-2],1
2FB1: je 2FCB
that jump was taken during my single stepping, so I NOPped out the CMP and 
replaced JE with JMPS. Then booted Linux and APM seems to work fine - battery 
percentage and remaining time is there as well as AC power status.
There seems to be 4 these operations:
mov [bp][-2],bx
cmp w,[bp][-2],1
cmp w,[bp][-2],8002
cmp w,[bp][-2],8001
but I've hit only the first two of them. I wonder what's that for (especially 
when it works without that).
