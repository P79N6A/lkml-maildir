Yes, this is a long standing and well known issue with Linux.  As you
mention later in your email, this does not affect Linux directly, because
it never uses the last sector of odd-sized disks or partitions.  The only
place it has been noticed is with the Linux NTFS driver (which is unable
to store the MFT backup in the last sector of the partition) and the NT
LDM driver which breaks when odd-sized volumes are concatenated together
(one sector is missing out of the middle of the volume).

Because BSD != Linux, they do not really have any code in common.

You may want to use an email program which doesn't screw up the
formatting so badly, not that it really matters in this case.
In the end, this has been discussed several times on l-k, and while
people have expressed a desire to fix it, it has never been done.
This is probably because anyone who knows enough about Linux to fix
it uses Linux all the time, and at that point they don't need to fix
it anymore...
Cheers, Andreas
