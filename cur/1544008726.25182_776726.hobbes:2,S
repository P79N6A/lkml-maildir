Subject: [optional git pull request] Intel GEM updates for 2.6.28 final
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi Linus,
Since we just introduced GEM in this kernel, and this patch series only 
touches GEM and fixes some problems discovered in it since it went 
upstream, Intel would like for these fixes to go in ASAP. They fix a host 
of general bugs founds by running OpenGL conformance tests and using GEM 
from the userspace 2D driver. If you don't want them now, they can wait 
until stable.
Please pull the 'drm-gem-update' branch from
ssh://master.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/airlied/drm-2.6.git drm-gem-update
Dave.

    drm/i915: Return error in i915_gem_set_to_gtt_domain if we're not in the GTT.
    
    It's only for flushing caches appropriately for GTT access, not for actually
    getting it there.  Prevents potential smashing of cpu read/write domains on
    unbound objects.

    drm/i915: Retry execbuffer pinning after clearing the GTT
    
    If we fail to pin all of the buffers in an execbuffer request, go through
    and clear the GTT and try again to see if its just a matter of fragmentation

    drm/i915: Move the execbuffer domain computations together
    
    This eliminates the dev_set_domain function and just in-lines it
    where its used, with the goal of moving the manipulation and use of
    invalidate_domains and flush_domains closer together. This also
    avoids calling add_request unless some domain has been flushed.

    drm/i915: Rename object_set_domain to object_set_to_gpu_domain
    
    Now that the CPU and GTT domain operations are isolated to their own
    functions, the previously general-purpose set_domain function is now used
    only to set GPU domains. It also has no failure cases, which is important as
    this eliminates any possible interruption of the computation of new object
    domains and subsequent emmission of the flushing instructions into the ring.

    drm/i915: Make a single set-to-cpu-domain path and use it wherever needed.
    
    This fixes several domain management bugs, including potential lack of cache
    invalidation for pread, potential failure to wait for set_domain(CPU, 0),
    and more, along with producing more intelligible code.

    drm/i915: Make a single set-to-gtt-domain path.
    
    This fixes failure to flush caches in the relocation update path, and
    failure to wait in the set_domain ioctl, each of which could lead to incorrect
    rendering.

    drm/i915: If interrupted while setting object domains, still emit the flush.
    
    Otherwise, we would leave the objects in an inconsistent state, such as
    write_domain == 0 but on the flushing list.

    drm/i915: Move flushing list cleanup from flush request retire to request emit.
    
    obj_priv->write_domain is "write domain if the GPU went idle now", not
    "write domain at this moment."  By postponing the clear, we confused the
    concept, required more storage, and potentially emitted more flushes than
    are required.

    drm/i915: Respect GM965/GM45 bit-17-instead-of-bit-11 option for swizzling.
    
    This fixes readpixels and buffer corruption when swapped out and in by
    disabling tiling on them.
    
    Now that we know that the bit 17 mode isn't just a mistake of older chipsets,
    we'll need to work on a clever fix so that we can get the performance of
    tiling on these chipsets, but that will require intrusive changes targeted
    at the next kernel release, not this one.
