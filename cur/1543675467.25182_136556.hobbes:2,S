Disabling the proc filesystem is simple by unchecking one item in the 
kernel config menu and different from taking out "a chunk of libc" it's 
more or less supported.
I don't say #172735 is exploitable. An error message "Error: /proc isn't 
mounted" tells you what is wrong, a segmentation fault tells you 
_nothing_.
I've seen at several occasions that several man days were lost trying to
find problems in other programs that caused segmentation faults. In the
end things like diff'ing strace files give you important hints after
hours of clueless searching. Error messages instead of segmentation
faults would have prevented several fruitless hours in my live.
After reading the last sentence you might perhaps understand my opinion
about the quality of a software whose maintainer says about a
segmentation fault "Crashing is kind of a good thing even. ... In error 
checking, there is a certain balance to achieve." .
