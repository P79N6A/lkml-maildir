Yes.  I was asking of we actually need prefect robustness.  I'm fairly
confident that this approach would work well in practice, since if tids
are being churned, the thread with wrapped TID will exit soon anyway.
I mentioned the possibility to make sure you had considered it.
As an added bonus, the tone of the first response I received (not
yours!) reminded me why I am not subscribed to lkml...
Cheers!
Rusty.
