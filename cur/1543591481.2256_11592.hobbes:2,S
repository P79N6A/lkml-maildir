I think you're confusing a couple of different issues here, Alan.  Even 
supposing CML2 could parse CML1 rulesets, the design question about how
configuration *should* work (that is, what kind of user experience we 
want to create and who we optimize ruleset design for) wouldn't go away.
I'm raising these questions now because CML2's capabilities invite 
thinking about them.  But they're independent of the underlying language.
