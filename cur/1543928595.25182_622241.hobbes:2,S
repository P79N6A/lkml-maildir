Here are some driver core bugfixes and documentation updates for
2.6.24-rc3.  It fixes a regression with CONFIG_PM being set and not set
that people have reported.
There's some other minor fixes, and an update for the UIO documentation.
All of these have been in the -mm tree for a while.
Please pull from:

Patches will be sent as a follow-on to this message to lkml for people
to see.
thanks,
