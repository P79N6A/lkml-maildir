The race to which I refer here is if another CPU is running
percpu_counter_sum() in the window between the clearing of the bit in
cpu_online_map and the CPU_DEAD callout.  Maybe that's too small to care
about in the short-term, dunno.
Officially we should fix that by taking lock_cpu_hotplug() in
percpu_counter_sum(), but I hate that thing.
I was thinking of putting a cpumask into the counter.  If we do that then
there's no race at all: everything happens under fbc->lock.  This would be
a preferable fix, if we need to fix it.
But I'd prefer that freezer-based cpu-hotplug comes along and saves us
again.
umm, actually, we can fix the race by using CPU_DOWN_PREPARE instead of
CPU_DEAD.  Because it's OK if percpu_counter_sum() looks at a gone-away
CPU's slot.
