Hello,
When I try to compile the latest git tree
(git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git,
last change	Tue, 25 Mar 2008 06:24:16 +0000), make halts and prints an
error message. This happens both with GNU make version 3.79.1 and
version 3.81. The 2.6.24.3 kernel builds fine on my system with the
same tools, and that the Documentation/Changes document has not been
changed since 2.6.24.3. Does anyone know how I can get around this ?
# gmake --version
GNU Make version 3.79.1, by Richard Stallman and Roland McGrath.
...
# gmake
Makefile:112: *** target pattern contains no `%'.  Stop.
# make --version
GNU Make 3.81
...
# make
Makefile:112: *** target pattern contains no `%'.  Stop.
Bart.
