For the chain elements - yes, definitely! But we also want to clear dma
mapping output values, at least sparc64 wants that. You could argue that
the IOMMU code should be fixed up, but I don't think we should mix the
two.
So we need the memset() in blk_rq_map_sg() AS WELL AS the initial sg
table clear. I'm not arguing about the latter, we clearly do need that.

Not for the output members, they will be filled AFTER blk_rq_map_sg()
returns and someone use iommu_map_sg() to re-iterate the sglist and map
the pages appropriately.
