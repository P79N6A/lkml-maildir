For example, consider the following case:
  a process forks many children and system administrator wants to
  allow only one of these processes to dump shared memory.
This is accomplished as follows:
 $ echo 1 > /proc/self/coremask
 $ ./some_program
 (fork children)
 $ echo 0 > /proc/<a child's pid>/coremask
With the /proc/<pid>/ interface, we don't need to modify the
user program.  In contrast, with the ulimit or setrlimit interface,
the administrator can't do it without modifying the user program
to call setrlimit.  This will not be preferred.

The coremask setting is inherited in mm_init(), which is called
once as an extention of do_fork(), do_execve() or compat_do_execve().
Inheritance is done by copying the bitmask from current->mm->coremask.
However, if current->mm is NULL, the inherited bitmask is set to 0
(default value).
