I talked to Thomas already, hadn't seen Davej's list, thanks for that.
I guess the main difference with an full bug tracking system rather
than a web page or text email is that it's easier to distribute the
workload around. I think this is too much for any one person to maintain,
hence the problem with these things getting out of date.

Right, some sort of linkage would be needed with both this and the
main Linus tree for checkins - I think the latter is actually a more
major concern ... bugs should be closed when they're (confirmed) fixed
in the mail tree.

Systems like this will normally involve a little additional overhead,
but I think the payback is worthwhile. Bugzilla has email triggers, 
so it would be easy to set up bugs filed against any particular
category to be automatically emailed to the maintainer(s) for that 
category. The bug could then be sanity checked, and sent to lkml.
Or something like that ;-)
