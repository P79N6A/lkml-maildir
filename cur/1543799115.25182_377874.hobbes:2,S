Of course, that's not what I'm saying. What I am saying is interpreted
from the driver or further down in the io stack.

Yes, it has to choose one of the two pools.

There are two sides to this - looking at the request allocations pools,
yes if you want a request you have to tell from which pool you want it
from. But a request that originates from that particular pool (in this
case the write pool), does _not_ have to imply any transfer of data from
a device!

That's not up for debate, of course that is the case. Otherwise we could
not issue any request unless it needed to transfer data from a device.
Just because an empty request happens to have the data direction bit
set, does not mean it wants to transfer data to the device. By
definition, that is an impossibility since there's nothing to transfer.

There _was_ a bug in the SCSI layer, because it had logic like this:
        if (rq_data_dir(req) == WRITE)
                DMA_TO_DEVICE
        else if (req->data_len)
                DMA_FROM_DEVICE
        else
                DMA_NONE
which was buggy, because for it to transfer data to the device, both the
direction bit _and_ a data length must be set.
