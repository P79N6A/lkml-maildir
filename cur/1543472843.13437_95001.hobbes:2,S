My howling about e.g. MCA was not to suggest a deal. It was to suggest
to IBM that they unilaterally contribute something to open technology,
just like the rest of us. Linus et. al. can't get involved in a bunch of
quid pro quo with the kernel without disastrous effect on the kernel, 
seems to me. Linus, GNU, AlanTedAndreas<your name here>... etc. are
the *providers* here. That would be what bothers me if I was IBM.
BTW, y'all, thanks for GNU/Linux. IBM, thanks for nothing.
