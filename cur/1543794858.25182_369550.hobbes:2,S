And just to set the record straight, for those that want to read things
into this proposal, this patch is the creation of my personal opinion,
and I do not speak for, nor represent my employer, or anyone else.
This patch was to get people who are relying on binary drivers to think
about the risk they are taking when they do so.  It is not intended as
legal advice, but a thought exercise only.
And if anyone thinks I would actually apply such a patch directly as-is,
they are wrong.  I would not deserve to be the PCI maintainer if I did
so.
thanks,
greg k-h
