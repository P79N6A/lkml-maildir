(shortened CC list a bit)
In fact I am not sure what you mean. On every lock and unlock operation, 
in case of recursive locking (which our case is), you have to provide 
class identifier, which is used to distinguish if the lock is of the same 
instance, or a different one (deeper or higher in the locking hierarchy). 
There is no way how spin_lock() or mutex_lock() can know this 
"automatically", you always have to provide the nesting level from 
outside, as it depends on the ordering hierarchy, which locking primitives 
are totally unaware of.
Or did I misunderstand you?
Thanks,
