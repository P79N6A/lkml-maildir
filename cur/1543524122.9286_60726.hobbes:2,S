GNU binutils can do .sys and .exe files, i.e. NT drivers.  It doesn't do
.vxd files.  I'm not sure about .dll files.  Using the i386-winnt
configuration or something like that.
Last time I looked it has a bug which places symbols at the wrong
address, which in fact ruins the disassembly: instructions are broken at
the incorrect symbol addresses.
A patch, and nearby some Perl scripts which make the listing completely
symbolic (no addresses) are found at:
