I've had this problem since late 2.1 kernels with my toshiba
tecra. Redhat 5.1 5.2 and 6.0.  Since alt+sysRq doesn't work I can't
see how this can be any other than a kernel bug.
When I boot into this keyboardless state, the machine is still alive,
and I can use it via the network as normal.  Its just the console that 
is fried.  It doesn't seem to make any difference whether fbcon or the 
normal console is used.
