Subject: Re: [PATCH] reserve end-of-conventional-memory to 1MB on 32-bit
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/29/97

This patch adds explicit detection of the EBDA and reservation
of the rom and adapter address space 0xa0000-0x100000 to the
i386 kernels. It uses reserve_bootmem instead of reserve_early,
because reserve_early is not yet available on i386.
Before this patch, the EBDA size was hardcoded as 4Kb. Also, the 
reservation of the adapter range was done by modifying the e820
map which is now not necessary any longer, and the code is removed
from copy_e820_map.
The changes in e820_64.c are only a change in the comment above
copy_e820_map, and some changes of the types of local variables
in that function such that the 32 and 64 bit versions become equal.

Thank you!
Ingo,
I think this is ready for -x86#testing.
It boots to a small userspace in qemu (i386).
If I should separate the cleanups, let me know.
Greetings,
