Generally most drivers power down hardware, MAC at least, when the 
interface is down.  As such, many drivers do not (cannot), as written, 
report any useful link information.
IF the phy is not powered down, when the interface goes down, and IF 
hardware permits, it would certainly be nice to report link state when 
interface is down.  This is a hardware-dependent, driver-dependent choice.
