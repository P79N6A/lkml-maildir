Yikes!  Until we fix that there's no point in looking at anything else.
CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC would nail this bug in a flash, but x86_64 doesn't
implement the damn thing :(
So if this is repeatable it would be of some value if you can work out what
causes it - start by disabling netfilter.
But to fix it for real we'll probably need to twiddle thumbs until an x86
person can hit it.
