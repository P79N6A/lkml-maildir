From a scan through the patch, it looks like it does in fact only
handle those tcp, udp and raw.  
Sctp also should be supported by these mechanisms, given that 2.6
has both in the main tree.
I'd expect many systems which will be installed in the next few
quarters and which could make good use of the selinux controls 
will require sctp support.
