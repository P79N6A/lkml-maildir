As TyTso suggested the problem could be ato to be zero. I checked and I
finally also spotted the offending bug that was causing the above
condition to happen (second chunk of the patch):

An incoming synack doesn't carry any data into the packet so the
tcp_delack_estimator gets not recalled from tcp_ack, and the ato stays
zero. Then tcp_send_ack (the one we send to put the other end in
enstablished state) goes oom and queue the delack timer while ato is still
zero. Then the timer gets reinserted in the current queue from
run_timer_list and boom!
The fact an oom condition was necessary to trigger the bug, perfectly
explains why it wasn't reproducible in most machines.
