I had this happen to me last week on a brand new box (never had
anything put into its PCI slots before), Pulled it out, gave the
card contacts a wipe over (even though they didn't *look* dirty)
plugged it back in, and it worked perfectly.
Odd thing was, I googled for the PCI ID that showed up, and all
it turned up was a Don Becker posting suggesting dirty contacts.
