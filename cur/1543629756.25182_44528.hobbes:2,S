And is exactly why this showed up in the USB subsystem :)

And it removes the dependency of devfsd and its interface, replacing it
with the existing /sbin/hotplug interface.  This allows different people
to implement different naming schemes if they so desire, moving naming
policy out of the kernel into userspace, where it belongs.
Yes, there will probably be a "default" naming scheme, matching what we
have today, but the ability to replace it with another one is _so_ much
easier than having to try to tie into devfsd (like the devreg
implementation does:

 )
