 say you wanna write a 500MB file
on a disk with plenty of space.
but when you create the file it happens to
create it in a place that only a 50MB file can
fit because there is another file on the disk in that
position. after 50MB is created then you have to put the rest file
elsewhere thus you now have a fragmented file.
