NAT traversal can be done, in some (limited) cases even without the 
cooperation of the NAT (although someone on the inside must cooperate). 
Firewalls do be a problem.  I think the best thing here is if you use this 
kind of thing outside the firewall; I always build networks, even LANs, 
with the crown jewels behind a firewall from the workstations, especially 
if they run Windows.  Authenticated IPSEC is a nice way to find out if we 
can to some extent trust them, although it costs cycles.
As for compatibility, there are three ways to do it presently in the IETF 
process (HIP, IKEv2 and FreeSWAN opportunistic mode), and two of them have 
running code on multiple platforms.
