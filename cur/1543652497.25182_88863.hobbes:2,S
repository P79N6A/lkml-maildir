readahead in 2.5 unplugs.  Which is quite wrong for AIO, but is unavoidable
given the current situation...

No, no, no.  Step back, miles back.  Forget the current implementation
and ask yourself "what is a good design for plugging?".  Because I can
assure you that if someone came out and proposed the current design for
inclusion in today's kernel, they would be pulverised.
Plugging is an optimisation which is specific to, and internal to the
request layer.  It should not require that every client of that layer
know about it, and be careful to unplug (with bizarrely complex locking
and ordering rules) simply because the request layer is too lame to look
after its own stuff.
Particularly because the clients of the request layer do not have enough
information to make a good decision about when to unplug.  Only the
request layer knows that.
And particularly because we've been hitting the same darn bug for years.
And we've been blaming the poor old callers!
The request layer should perform its own unplug "when the time is right",
and the external unplug should be viewed as an optimisation hint.
It all becomes rather obvious when you try to answer the question "when
should the kernel unplug for AIO reads"?
And yes, the fact that the time-based component of the unplug decision
would obscure failure by callers to make use of the optimisation hint
is unfortunate.  But it's only a few callsites, and 99.9999% coverage
there is good enough.
