Sorry for the probably dumb thing I am about to say, but isn't the
"sync" mount option doing just what is required ? Hum, well, not exactly
in fact, since the write() call will not return until all data is
written, but this difference with your semantic can be handled in
software. Moreover, you really want to wait for data being written,
since bad sectors are common on nowadays floppies and your program wants
to be notified synchronously about the error.
