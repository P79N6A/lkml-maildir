Ack'ing the sata_promise change was easy, but with this one it would
be nice to wait a bit before changing the core probe code that [now]
every ATA setup goes through, based on a single bug report.
The values assist in detecting ghost devices (same device appearing
on both master and slave) and TF register malfunctions, and I would
appreciate not breaking _that_ so late in 2.6.22-rc for a single
report.  Thankfully we have -some- ghost device prevention code
elsewhere, but this is part of it.
Fedora 7 reports are starting to come in, and those will help point
us in the right direction too.
I'll be home for a bit in 36 hours (->net driver fixes go then)
and for good on Tuesday, so I'm hoping you can wait until then.
