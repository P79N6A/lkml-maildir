Yes, man pages needs some work after the interface will be fixed. I hope
to fix it this week.

Sigh, I liked it :)

You get EEXIST
Well, there's the remote possibility, trying very badly from two threads,
to add the same fd twice. It is an harmless condition though.

Yes. Not suggested though.

Yes.

Yes.

Uh ?!

You might find your machine a little bit frozen :)
Either 1) I remove the read lock from poll() or 2) I check the condition
at insetion time to avoid it. I very much prefer 2)

I'd say yes. SCM_RIGHTS should simply do an in-kernel file* to remote task
descriptor mapping.

The starting point are the bits found at insertion time.

Yes, they'll be combined.

You can do two operations on an existing fd. Remove is meaninless for this
case. Modify will re-read available bits.

IMHO distinc functions are more clear than magic read/write operations.
