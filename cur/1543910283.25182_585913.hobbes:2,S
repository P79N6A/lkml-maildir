Subject: [PATCH] qconf: show red links for disabled options
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/8/18/62

When 'Show debug info' is checked then a list of links
to dependant symbols is shown in info view right bottom pane.
Currently all links are in standard blue. With this patch
links to disabled symbols are shown in red instead.
This, together with 'Show all options', allows to quickly
check out why a given option is hidden.

I understand that color coding could be a poor choice due to people
with color differencing problems.
I chose this anyway to avoid crufting the output with additional signs/symbols,
this could became very ugly in case of long option lists.
