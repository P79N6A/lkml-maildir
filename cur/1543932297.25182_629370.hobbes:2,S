Add to that a totally unchanged value can just be easier to get correct.
Still the kexec code as much as it can should not look there, as we may
get the same basic information in a couple of different ways.
EFI memmap vs. e820 for example.  If/when that is the case /sbin/kexec
should get the information and spit it out into whatever format makes
sense for the destination kernel.  My sense is just passing through
values is brittleness where we don't want it.
However I think being able to get at the raw boot information overall
sounds useful.  I just don't know if it is generally useful or just
useful when debugging bootloaders though.
