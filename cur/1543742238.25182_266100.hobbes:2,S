I wonder what the "correct" solution for this would be: write a
specification for Linux ptrace, or try to get the POSIX folks
interested ?
Given that we get subtle ptrace breakages quite regularly, it
would be nice to see this eventually get resolved. "The
implementation is the specification" doesn't seem to work well
in this case.
BTW, things have improved around UML quite a bit recently, and I
think this is to no small amount due to Paolo's work.
