Dominik is measuring energy expended (watts * seconds) vs work done (CPU
cycles). But your claim above is "clock throttling...does not save power
[but it lets] the CPU cool down", which talks about power (watts) and
heat (also watts, in fact the *very same* watts) and is physically
impossible. A CPU turns power into heat. Less heat out implies less
power in.
So while throttling may be less efficient in terms of watt seconds used
to compile something than running at full speed, it is incorrect to say
it uses less power. One machine running for an hour throttled to 50%
uses less power (and therefore less battery and cooling) than another
running at full speed for that same hour.
The first machine may take significantly longer to complete its task (or
it may not, if the task is reading email or watching video), but that's
another matter entirely. And whether it's more or less efficient than
other power-saving approaches is also another matter. Throttling does
save power.
