Ah, via PF_RANDOMIZE, yes, thanks: so long as certain conditions are
fulfilled - and my RLIM_INFINITY RLIMIT_STACK has been preventing it.
And mmaps include shmats: so unless the process specifies non-NULL
shmaddr to attach at, it'll choose a randomized address for that too
(subject to those various conditions).
Which is indeed a further disincentive against shared page tables.
