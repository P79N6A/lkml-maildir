I was already doing OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE. I didn't think of disabling
FORCED_INLINING, thanks for reminding me of that. I managed to trim
the kernel in other ways.

I'll try that later today (and I'll also provide the
/proc/latency_trace to help figure out the warning). In the meantime,
I can confirm that the floppy drive started working again with
lock-validator-floppyc-irq-release-fix.patch reverted.
BTW, the latency_trace is close to 130K. Should I send it to you by
private mail instead of to the list? Or should I compress it and send
it as an attachment?
Andrew, I can also confirm that the LLC hotfix is allowing LLC (and
AppleTalk) to work again.
