As long as 1) your program is not MT 2) your process creates exactly *one* 
unique file. Then yes, it is fine. But, if your program is MT (with 
threads sharing the PID) or your single thread process creates two (or 
more) unique files within 1 sec, you've got a problem. Using gettid() 
would solve the MT issue (there's still the tid recycling period), but not 
the time issue.
