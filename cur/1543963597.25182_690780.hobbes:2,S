May be I am missing something. Only time mmap will behave differently is
when some of the pre-existing conditions are different. If the MTRRs are
different and/or there has been conflicting mapping in between first and
second mmap. Otherwise, it will be same. We had to do this inheriting
Business if there are other conflicting maps to have compatibility with
All existing /dev/mem users.

We thought about splitting the range. But, in general the interface
requires
us to give one single type of access back. Interfaces like pci accesses
in /sysfs. If user maps the file with mmap, we give one particular type
of mapping.
returning multi type may be a possibility, but that will mean whole new
level of complications in tracking, splitting the vmas, returning this
subrange mapping info to user in some way etc.
Sub-range of a page is probably improbable. But overlaps are common.
That is exactly what is happening with the issue in this thread.
Part of the region is mmaped first (it will get UC_MINUS) and MTRR setup
for WC.
Later a bigger region that includes the first smaller part is being
mmaped. We can
safely return UC_MINUS to this bigger request (without causing any
aliases) and things
will work fine as this bigger mmap does its own MTRR for WC as well.
This is the case
where I feel just maintaining the consistency across the PAT list (which
is UC_MINUS)
here is safe irrespective of any MTRR setting we may have underneath.
Worrying about
MTRR ranges here doesn't seem to add any additional safety-ness.
