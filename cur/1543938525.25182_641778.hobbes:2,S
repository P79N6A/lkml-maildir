I have most excellent news.  I was able to get tinyBIOS booting on my
development platform.  I looked at the problem with the debugger and
I think I might have found something.  It looks like the interrupt is
firing immediately before the clock is enabled.  In the handler, we
were returning immediately if the clock wasn't enabled (and not clearing
the event), so we were caught in a classic interrupt storm.
The attached patch rearranges the code so that the handler is installed
before we setup the interrupt (so we have somebody to listen to the
immediate interrupt), and it makes sure that we clear the event in the IRQ
handler regardless of the state of the timer tick.
I'm not 100% sure why this happens on IRQ7 but not on 5 or 8, but it might
have something to do with the interrupts already being enabled on the other
vectors.  Anyway, please try this test patch and let me know what happens.

[GEODE] fix a race condition in the MFGPT timer tick
From: Jordan Crouse <jordan.crouse@amd.com>
When we set the MFGPT timer tick, there is a chance that we'll
immediately assert an event.  If for some reason the IRQ routing
for this clock has been setup for some other purpose, then we
could end up firing an interrupt into the SMM handler or worse.
This rearranges the timer tick init function to initalize the handler
before we set up the MFGPT clock to make sure that even if we get
an event, it will go to the handler.
Furthermore, in the handler we need to make sure that we clear the
event, even if the timer isn't running.
