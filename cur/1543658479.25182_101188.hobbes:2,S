Thanks. So my questions are related to what `monitored by statd' means:
    - Why don't all the diskless workstations get an entry in that
      directory while they are running? Right now I have 5 running, and
      only one has an entry there.
    - Why do most entries' mtime get updated periodically, but a few of
      the entries go stale with time?
    - Why do some of the stale entries get left over even after the
      workstations have halted (these ones present the nfs hang issue)?
Take care,
