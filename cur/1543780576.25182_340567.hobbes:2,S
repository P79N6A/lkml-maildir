What do those higher layers look like? Do you have a userspace component
that uses this interface?
Who is using this code? Are there vendors that are already shipping
systems with this enabled?
Is this part of the DPM project? If so, what other components are left in
DPM?
What are your plans to integrate this more with the cpufreq code?
Thanks,
