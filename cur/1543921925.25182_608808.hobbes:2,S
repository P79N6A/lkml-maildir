Also, please add a "lguest: " prefix to all future commits.
Otherwise, in the one-line summary, it is impossible to tell what 
portion of the kernel is being updated:
	Use "struct boot_params" in example launcher
	Loading bzImage directly.
	Rename "cr3" to "gpgdir" to avoid x86-specific naming.
	Pagetables to use normal kernel types
	Move register setup into i386_core.c
	Accept elf files that are valid but have sections that can not
		be mmap'ed for some reason.
git tools are all keyed to use that first line as a summary of the 
changeset, without giving any other context whatsoever.  See Linus's 
2.6.X-rcY announcements, for example.
This is also described in akpm's
