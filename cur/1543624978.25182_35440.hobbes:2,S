That reminds me of a patch to gut verify_write when CONFIG_X86_WP_WORKS_OK=y.
Saves a few bytes.  Patch is against 2.5.7pre2.
We could bin the whole thing and stop exporting it, but there may be users 
who try to load binary only modules that were built for 386 and hence expect 
verify_write to be exported regardless of CPU type the kernel was built for.
Paul.
