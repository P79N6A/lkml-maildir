the intel chip supports only one stream for playback, so the
succeeding open is blocked since ALSA opens the device in the blocking
mode as default.  and it's so for OSS-emulation, too.
for the oss-emulation, you can change this behavior via the module
option nonblock_open of snd-pcm-oss module.  please check
Documentation/sound/alsa/OSS-Emulation.txt.
