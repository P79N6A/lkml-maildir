Caused due to Oleg's patch 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/13/93.
Agreed that most of the time a kthread_create(p) is followed by a
kthread_bind(p), in which case the assertion 
WARN_ON(p->state != TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE) makes sense.
But, in cpu hotplug case, we need to rebind the stop_machine_run thread
from the cpu which has just been offlined to any online cpu.
(kernel/cpu.c line 180)
At this point, the thread would be in TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE waiting for us
to call a kthread_stop on it.(kernel/kthread.c line 161)
We only need to ensure in kthread_bind that the task which is being
bound is not running or exiting. Doesn't matter if it's sleeping in 
TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE or TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE state.
