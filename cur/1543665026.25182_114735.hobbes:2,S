Subject: sysfs mount point permissions in 2.5.64

In lk 2.5.64 on my i386 box the sysfs mount point
( "/sys") changes permission from:
   drwxr-xr-x
to
   drw-r--r--
during the boot process. I didn't notice this feature
in lk 2.5.63 . Chmodding the directory back to its former
permissions get overridden by subsequent boot sequences.
This change in permissions inhibits non-root users from using
utilities that scan sysfs for information (e.g. lsscsi).
Is this a feature or otherwise?
