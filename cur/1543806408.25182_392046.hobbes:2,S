jpeg is fine.  It helps if you can get 50 rows on the screen - boot with
the appropriate `vga=' option, put SYSFONT="iso08.08" in
/etc/sysconfig/i18n, etc.
It seems that some cpufreq notifier has done a divide-by-zero.  But I can't
see any sign of which one it is.  You might get a better trace if you set
CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER=n.
If you could do those things and then prepare another photo it would really
help, thanks.
