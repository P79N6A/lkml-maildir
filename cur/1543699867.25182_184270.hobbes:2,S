It definitely does. It makes the difference between having stuff
work or not in many embedded systems.

This is a BUG. This wastes space that may end up being embedded
in NVRAM, then copied to RAM. If it was not initialized, it would
never exist in NVRAM at all.

This is not a BUG because "__initdata" is defined to be in a segment
that is initialized and discarded after use.

It's not style. It's misuse of variables and well-defined
conventions. Often data is not some simple variable, but an
aggregate type such as a structure or an array. FYI "style"
relates to naming conventions and where you put curley braces.
Even that is supposed to be controlled to some liberal extent.
static long xtable[0x100] = {0,};
MUST be in the .data segment, while...
static long xtable[0x100];
MUST be in the .bss segment, while...
static const long xtable[0x100]={0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,.....};
MUST be in the .const segment. It's that simple. If you
violate that, your code will only work by fiat, i.e., it
was defined to work, not designed to work.
Cheers,
