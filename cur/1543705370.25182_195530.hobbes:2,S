[SuSE x86 linux 8.2, 2.4.24 kernel building]
I've been upgrading from 2.4.20 (SuSE) to a fresh generic kernel from
ftp.kernel.org: 2.4.24.  In previous builds there
was a very handy virtual file /proc/config.z that allowed me to find
out exactly how the currently running kernel was configured. I could then do 
  cd /usr/src
  tar xvfz /tmp/linux-2.4.24.tz
  cd linux-2.4.24
  zcat /proc/config.z >.config
  make oldconfig  -- hit return a few dozen times
  make menuconfig -- fix a few things
  make dep && make bzImage && make modules && make modules_install
The /proc/config.z file seems to have disappeared! Is there some
config parameter that enables this? Or has it gone away between 2.4.20
and 2.4.24?
