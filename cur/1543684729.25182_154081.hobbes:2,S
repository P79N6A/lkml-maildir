For running X when /dev/mem is disabled, a solution can /dev/svga 
device, that I wrote for svgalib. It allows mmap access like 
/dev/mem, but only for VGA cards related memory - PCI regions that 
belong to VGA cards, and 0-0x110000 (for drivers that use the bios).
Of course, depending on the video card and the system, access to the 
video card's registers might be equivalent to access to all system 
memory, but it does add another layer of security.
