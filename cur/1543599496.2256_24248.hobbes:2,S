This bug still exists in 2.4.10-pre2 (from the linuxppc_2_4_devel
tree).  The first TCP connection to the machine hangs after a few KB
of data.  Connections after that work fine.  A tcpdump shows strange
retransmit behavior before the hang but I haven't investigated it
further.
Philipp Reisner says it's fixed in 2.2.20-pre8 but I can't find any
equivalent fix in 2.4.8-2.4.10.
Have I found a new bug or did the patch not make it into 2.4 after
all?
