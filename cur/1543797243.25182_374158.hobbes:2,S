I don't think it's  true any more (with this new patch).

Please remember that using threads is just a default option which may be 
even turned off at the kernel configuration stage.
Using threads for async transfers is reasonable _default_ assumption. It 
can save time for controller driver dev'ers as well as reduce overall 
kernel footprint (as opposed to different controller drivers each 
implementing thread-based async messages handling).

Hmm, how are we impacting drivers that want different implementation 
policies? Please look at the latest core :)

I don't argue about the need of chaining.
But don't you want to agree that things like this
+	struct spi_transfer	x[1] = { { .tx_dma = 0, }, };
...more initialization follows, spread around the code...
are not well-readable and may shadow what's going on and even lead to 
errors during support/extension of the functionality?
Exposing SPI message structure doesn't look good to me also because 
you're making it a part of the interface (and thus unlikely to change).
We're hiding spi_msg internals what allows us to be more flexible in 
implementation (for instance, implement our own allocation technique for 
spi_msg (more lightweight as the size is always the same).
Yeah thus we don't have an ability to allocate SPI messages on stack as 
you do, that's what votes for your approach. Yours is thus a bit faster, 
though I suspect that this method is a possible *danger* for really 
high-speed devices with data bursts on the SPI bus like WiFi adapters: 
stack's gonna suffer from large amounts of data allocated.

Okay :)
