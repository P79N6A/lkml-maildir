There is not sync between kernel pci.ids and pciids DB since time ago.
Some ids are only in kernel, some ids newer in pciids and some ids are in both
with differents names. It is not so easy like to do a diff.
It's necessary to review every id from diff output _one by one._
But in general, pciids DB is more updated.
