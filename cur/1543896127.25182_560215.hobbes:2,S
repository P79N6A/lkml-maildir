No. I would argue that the kernel should try to trickle things out, so 
that it doesn't disturb anything, and a "big dump" becomes a "steady 
trickle".
And that's what "vm_dirty_ratio" is all about.

No, the vm tunable is exactly what it's all about.
Do a big "untar", and what you *want* to see is not "instant dump, 
followed by long pause". 
A much *smoother* behaviour is generally preferable, and most of the time 
that's true even if it may be lower throughput in the end!
Of course, "synchronous writes" are *really* smooth (you never allow any 
dumps at *all* to build up), so this is about a balance - not about 
"perfect smoothness" vs "best throughput", but about a heuristic that 
finds a reasonable middle ground.
There is no "perfect". There is only "stupid heuristics". Maybe the 
"vm_dirty_ratio" is a bit *too* stupid, but it definitely is needed in 
some form.
It can actually be more than just a "performance" vs "smoothness" issue: 
the 40% thing was actually a *correctness* issue too, back when we coutned 
it as a percentage of total memory. A highmem machine would allow 40% of 
all memory free and it was all in low memory, and that literally caused 
lockups.
So the dirty_ratio is not *only* about smoothness, it's also simply about 
the fact that the kernel must not allow too much memory to be dirtied, 
because that leads to out-of-memory deadlocks and other nasty issues. So 
it's not *purely* a tunable.
