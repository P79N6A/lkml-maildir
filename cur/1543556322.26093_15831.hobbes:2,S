Oh, and you have to provide the complete text of the GPL as well, and
for that you do *not* have a "only if they ask for it" clause.
Or so it seems to some people, like RMS.  See this week's DWN: there is
a nice long discussion in debian-devel about this.  Apparently RMS
demands that all GPL'd Debian binary packages include a copy -- it is
not enough that the Debian base system already has a copy and that all
GPL'd source tarballs include a copy.
I do not agree with this interpretation, because it would mean that any
GPL'd file that can possibly be independently downloaded (such as a .c
file from a CVS server) must include that same 17k document.
...But just so everyone knows: according to RMS, every file on your FTP
server that you provide under the GPL v2 must include a copy of the
GPL.  (Easy enough to do with tar files, harder for other formats, and
never mind the wasted bandwidth.)  Having the GPL in a separate file on
your site does not count, apparently.
