Yes, that's a point for discussion.  Certainly, a patchbot list like 
patches-2.5-maintainer should require registration, and in fact, registration 
for this list will be by invitation.  It's not so clear what the policy 
should be on the patches-2.5 list.  Openness is a nice thing to be able to 
boast about.  Maybe the thing to do is try it open, and see how it works out.
We also have to worry about malicious spamming of the patch list.  I've heard 
this happened to kuro5hin's story submission queue - there is no accounting 
for all the forms of insect life out there.
