There is still a stall with PPC  boxes that have powersave enabled. I
use a 74xx based board and unless I disable powersave
(ppc_md.power_save=NULL), I get a stall at:
NET: Registered protocol family 2
Reverting default_idle to prepatch form I still see the hang. I think
it is somewhere else in the patchset. Still looking....
Thanks
