They refer to the compression modules that ppp can use (bsd_comp.o
and ppp_comp.o).  Due to the way the kernel module autoload works,
one module uses two of these IDs.  To allow kmod to automagically
load them, you need to add the following lines to /etc/conf.modules:
alias ppp-compress-21 bsd_comp.o
alias ppp-compress-24 ppp_deflate.o
alias ppp-compress-26 ppp_deflate.o
For further info on using them, read the documentation that comes
with pppd.
