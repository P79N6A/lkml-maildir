No, definitely not define a hypercall ABI.  The feature bit should say 
"this device understands a hypervisor-specific way of kicking.  consult 
your hypervisor manual and cpuid bits for further details.  should you 
not be satisfied with this method, port io is still available".

If we don't call it a hypercall, but a virtio kick operation, we don't 
need to worry about the hypercall number or ABI.  It's just a function 
that takes an argument that's implemented differently by every 
hypervisor.  The default implementation can be a pio operation.

IIRC pci slots are 8-bit, but you can have multiple buses, so 
effectively 16 bits of device address space (discounting functions which 
are likely not hot-pluggable).
