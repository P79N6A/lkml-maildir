By the time Linux 2.8.0 is out, gcc-3.3+ should be
a perfectly reasonable requirement.
In the mean time, adding may_alias as needed would be
a good idea.
If all this were behind CONFIG_BROKEN, it sure wouldn't
hurt even today. People might as well get started.
The compiler will keep being pessimistic and dumb until
the -Wno-strict-aliasing option is dropped.

It's easiest to use on function parameters. This helps
the optimizer without being a mind-warping excercise.
