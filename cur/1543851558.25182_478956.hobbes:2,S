OK. After some testing I found something interesting: in vanilla
2.6.19-rc4 - tifm works (I mean "removing the SD card from the
FlashMedia controller does not oops")
So, as I'm pretty sure 2.6.18-mm3 didn't trigger the oops, the cause
is in something between 2.6.18-mm3 and 2.6.19-rc2-mm2.
However, the driver does not survive a suspend-to-disk cycle; I will
open another thread for this.
Regards,
Fabio
