I think, "make" (even whatever shiny new) that particular problem can't
handle. Regexp on *file name* is needed, while PATH must be untouched.
That what i meant with spliting tasks. Stripping strings of wildcards
by "make dedicated functions" is ugly, IMHO. 
Also, what do you think, if someone (very unlikely) will add port of build
system to something different? Clear logic for a "rule" is there, one can
easily make whole `include/config/kernel.release' with that.

IMHO, cheap I/O. Yes, that isn't a big benefit, but i don't see anything
against, except, probably, filesystems without support of symlinks.

.... alone. I think it will be OK, Linus is with us!
Thanks, Roman.
