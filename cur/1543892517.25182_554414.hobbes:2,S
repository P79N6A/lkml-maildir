Most microsoft-compatible keys work by default without setkeycodes. But
yes, for those that aren't in the default table, it only knows the
meaning after you tell it with setkeycodes.

As I said, the algorithms/table to compute the keycode from the XT
scancodes are different in the kernel and in the X server, and that
can't be changed without breaking backwards compatibility.
The good news is that while the numbers aren't the same, there is a 1:1
mapping, that is, you'll get 153 in the server for 163 in the kernel,
always, regardless of the keyboard used or regardless of the actual key
you assigned this code to.
And I don't have the mapping table: It could likely be fairly easily
created by simply going through all the keys and writing the results
down.

No. You just need a 'setkeycodes' map for the extra keys, and that's
language-independent.

X doesn't get the loadkeys (keymap) processed data, it gets the
keycodes, which are only affected by setkeycodes.

It doesn't work with anything else but PS/2 keyboards. It's useless on
eg. USB.

Ugly.

That'd confuse people even more than the current situation.

I don't think it does work. One of our guys is trying to fix it by
	1) Converting the xkb multimedia keyboard descriptions to setkeycodes descriptions
	2) Creating a "linux keyboard" X xkb description
Then, after loading the setkeycodes at boot for the right keyboard
ty[e, AT keyboard will work fine, and USB and other keyboards will not
need *any* setup to have their multimedia keys working out of the box.
