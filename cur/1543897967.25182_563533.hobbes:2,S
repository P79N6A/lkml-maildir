I'll go over it in detail and get back to you later.

I don't.  I used TIF_DEBUG because it was already there and it was 
atomic.  But setting hw_breakpoint_info is equally atomic, so there's 
no reason to keep TIF_DEBUG.

Okay.

You certainly can do that in the hook routines.  But the generic code
still needs to use num_installed (which doesn't get used very much) and
num_kbps.

Good idea.  Splitting the code into two pieces made it considerably 
more opaque.

A nice new way to hang your machine!  :-)

Agreed.

Other than ptrace backward-compatibility.

I never have either.  Possibly you might want to change the value just 
before the read, based on the address of the code doing the reading.  
But I've never heard of anyone doing that.

I prefer the second alternative.  For the first, you'd have to register 
the breakpoint before knowing how it will behave!

In general that sounds good.  But do we really want the register call
to fail if extra handlers are defined?  That approach makes portable
drivers harder to write.  Maybe it would be better to fail only if all
of the arch-supported handler alternatives are NULL.

Unregistering the breakpoint isn't good on SMP systems, since it would
be unregistered on all CPUs.  I think it would better to require all
arch's to support the stepping logic.
