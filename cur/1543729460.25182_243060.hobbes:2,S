Oh please! You are complaining, accusing and flaming SuSE for they
are shipping a cdrecord version that is not working on one single
machine (since you cannot reproduce it yourself on another machine
now to give a dmesg output, it must be very machine-specific...)
after you have forced cdrecord to use some special mode instead
of using the SuSE default.
After Jens told you that this special mode does not work well with
earlier 2.6 kernels and that the default mode SuSE selects when you
don't override it would work without exactly the problem you are
creating by overriding the mode, you still keep complaining. And
when you are asked for further info so that people can help you
the machine is not in you posession anymore.
*cough* *cough*
