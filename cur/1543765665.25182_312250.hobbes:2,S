Hello!
Alacritech developed a new chip for NIC's
(
http://www.alacritech.com/html/tech_review.html
), which makes it possible
to take away the TCP stack from the host CPU. Therefore, the host CPU has
more performance for the applications according Alacritech.
This sounds interesting.
Unfortunately, there are two patents belonging to this solution.
Now, I'm wondering if it is possible to implement any support for these
chips in the Linux kernel. If this hardware solution does have really the
advantages described by Alacritech, it would be a pitty, if Linux couldn't
use this hardware.
What do you think about that?
Kind regards,
Andreas Hartmann
