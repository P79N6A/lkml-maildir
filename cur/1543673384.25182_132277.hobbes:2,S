 WinFS delayed, this probably means more time for semi-structured query languages
 to establish themselves instead of SQL
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
SQL would be just terrible for FS semantics to standardize on, and
hopefully we will be able to deploy a semi-structured querying language
alternative (www.namesys.com/whitepaper.html) before they ship.  I was
sort of expecting that they would be late, as they don't yet have a good
technical foundation in their FS storage layer for adding database
functionality, and we surely know that's a lot of work to create;-).
