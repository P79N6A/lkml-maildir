Reading through the thread, I've just tried everything you have.
I've used 2.4.18-rc4.  I've first mounted an NTFS partition.  Within
that I've mounted
1a)  Another NTFS partition (from a device)       1Gb   (< 2^31 bytes)
1b)  Another NTFS partition (from a device)       2.2Gb (> 2^31 bytes)
2)   Another NTFS partition (from a loop device)  2.2Gb (> 2^31 bytes)
3)   An ISO image (from a loop device)            20Mb  (< 2^31 bytes)
Please can you clarify what's going wrong.  I can't seem to get the
NTFS driver to go wrong.
If I can repeat the problem, I can probably fix it.

Don't worry.  If something doesn't work, someone here will want to hear
about it (and fix it).

P.S.  Anton's on holiday (current NTFS maintainer), so you've got me :-)
