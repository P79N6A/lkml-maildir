Seems reasonable to me.
This just leaves the issue of sizing the nvram.
Maybe this can be determined by checking the BIOS manufacturer & version.
(Admittedly this could be a large table, but this part is in userspace
anyhow). If the manufacturer or version are not supported, just make the
first 50 bytes available (as it is now), otherwise size it accordingly from
the lookup table.
