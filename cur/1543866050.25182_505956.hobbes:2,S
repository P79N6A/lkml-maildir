But in the graphical tool that's _good_. Because those are the options
you _wanted_ to see.
You don't want to go digging around under the SCSI menu where all those
boring hostadapters are, but you _do_ get to see the USB and ATA stuff
elsewhere.
But that's only for the graphical tool, which is where I actually
expected the handholding to be required. If you want it in 'oldconfig'
then I think that's weird, but I don't have a better solution than
'select', unfortunately.

That's exactly what I do too.

My experience is exactly the opposite; perhaps because I spend so much
of my time working on the Fedora kernel where almost everything starts
off enabled by default, and I only ever want to turn stuff off.
I think 'make oldconfig_noselect' is the way forward. We can both have
what we want.
