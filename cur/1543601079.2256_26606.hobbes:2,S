Hi,
In process scheduling, when an epoch ends because of the current process
completing its time quantum (and all the runnable ones having finished their
respective quantums), at the start of the new epoch, will the current running
process retain the cpu (assuming all the runnable ones are of the same
priority)?
Can anyone give some pointers as to where I can find detailed info for linux
process scheduling.
thanks,
shreeni.
