No, you don't need it. It is just what could be pinned in the worst case
in case you manage to generate that much dirty metadata quickly enough
that the flushing cannot cope.
Note that TCP (socket buffers) and other subsystems like fork() (process
stacks) or the mm subsystem (page tables) can use much more pinned memory, 
so better stop using all these evil things too.

Which are clustered in much less blocks and flushed lazily in small parts
(they are only pinned while they are flushed)
