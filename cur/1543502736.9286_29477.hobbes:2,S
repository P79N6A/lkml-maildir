Directory entry location is the key in internal cache. It may be changed
quite fine - just care to prevent lookups on it during the rename(). Which
happens automatically. If you have hardlinks you are *not* going to use
the link location as a key anyway. On FAT rename() takes the inode out of
internal cache, does its thing, puts inode back with the new key and
dirtifies it. Since both parents are locked... Indeed if you have
something out of the directories you will use that as a key and avoid the
whole trouble on rename(). The point being: the same technics can be used
for filesystems with the key larger than i_ino, etc.
