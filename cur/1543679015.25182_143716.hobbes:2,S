 Seems you have to add your own hooks for this and I guess you've seen
 CONFIG_NET_PROFILE which does accurate measurements for network related
 operations. It was long time since I used though...
.... could you please say something about CONFIG_NET_PROFILE and hooks you
have mentioned????
are there any documents ... related with hooks and CONFIG_NET_PROFILE
best regards
