I really want classes to be able to have "parent" classes someday.  It's
not that tough of a change to the driver core, if someone wants to do
the work.  That would enable this input stuff to be cleaner, right?
It would also allow us to move the /sys/block stuff to use classes,
which it can't right now due to the lack of the parent ability.
thanks,
