Then yes, if you set a system-wide limit that is less than the sum of the 
limits imposed on each accountable part of the system you can have lock out.  
But thats your fault for misconfiguring the system.  Don't do that.

Like so?
	if (nr_threads >= max_threads)
		if (p->pid != su_pid)
			goto bad_fork_cleanup_count;

RLIMIT_PROC is per user, this patch solves the global limit.

I am using kmail, it does this when the mail is queued before sending it.  
Maybe somebody can point out how to instruct kmail not to do that?
Or maybe use an attachment?

Could do that by:
	# echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/su-pid
which would imply nr-threads = 1
	
So maybe introduce /proc/sys/kernel/nr-threads to allow that to be variable, 
but this isn't really critical.
Thanks!
