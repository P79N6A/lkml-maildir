What's wrong with good ol' tar? You are obviously *not* going to have a
good time directly editing the file in question when something is mounted
from it and for keeping the /etc/ stuff in one file tar is perfectly OK.
Why mount it at all? Keep archive(s) and use tar to update/extract/create
them. No need to touch the kernel (and since files in /etc/ may change
size you are not going to have a good time doing corresponding
modifications to the underlying file on the fly). Why invent Linux-only
hacks when they do not add anything to standard portable solutions and put
extra code into the kernel?
