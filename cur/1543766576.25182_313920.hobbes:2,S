Ok, I'll try to implement that.

Heh, I don't, I'm just debugging it ;-)
It's interesting though that both the 4.x guys (linux-iscsi) and the
5.x ones (openiscsi, now both have merged) did the exact same mistake
while afaik their developments were independant.  There is a
documentation issue there.  If you could put what you just said in
Documentation/*, it should hopefully prevent this kind of
hard-to-track mistakes in the future.
  OG.
