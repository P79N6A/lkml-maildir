This hadn't gone unnoticed by me and I didn't like it either at first
however I had a look at the hardware specs and your summary below is
pretty accurate...

Since the commands are so device specific and no new device will be the
same, I doubt this is worth doing (or possible) in a generic way so
you're back to a).

If you expose 4 leds, you break the API badly as only one can be active.
That is worse than using the brightness parameter IMO.

After consideration, I agree with your approach of using the brightness
and I don't have a better suggestion. Its not ideal but its a good
compromise since it doesn't really impose any limitations on your use of
the hardware but doesn't need a custom implementation which is the
alternative. The mode is still a kind of brightness setting if you twist
the definition a bit ;-).
Cheers,
