Hi Linus,
 	Can you please pull the 'drm-patches' branch from:
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/airlied/drm-2.6.git
It contains just driver updates from DRM CVS for i915 and radeon.
Dave.

     Add i915 ioctls to configure pipes for vblank interrupt.
     i915 vblanks can be generated from either pipe a or b, however a disabled
     pipe generates no interrupts. This change allows the X server to select
     which pipe generates vblank interrupts.

     drm: update radeon to 1.25 add r200 vertex program support
     Add support for r200 vertex programs (R200_EMIT_VAP_PVS_CNTL, and new
     packet type for making it possible to address whole tcl vector space
     and have a larger count)

     drm: radeon add a tcl state flush before accessing tcl vector space
     Do a tcl state flush before accessing tcl vector space. This fixes some
     more problems with flickering (bug #6637). drm may not be appropriate
     place for this, since doing that flush there might both be overkill and
     insufficient in some cases. However, it's hard to figure out when that
     flush is needed, so this has to suffice. There does not seem to be a
     performance penalty associated with it.
