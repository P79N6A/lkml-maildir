That just simply means they should be working on a migration stratagy to
something that does have a security model with a domain of separation etc.
With the new outlook flaw found where it starts executing code even before
it hits your inbox... At least ILOVEYOU needed someone to actually open
the attachment. I wonder how many outlook users applied the corrective 
patch yet?
Mix latest outlook flaw with disk2brick and that could get ugly.

I would hope that people in the know would just warn their relatives that
running windows95/98 is a hugh security problem waiting to happen. At
least have them run NT or win2k. Better yet maybe mention linux or BSD.
Pointing out a flaw isn't bad as long as you also have a solution.
BTW I think adding check for CAP_SYS_RAWIO is a good solution for linux.
Windows 98 or lesser users simply need to think about migration.
Andre's announcements didn't change that at all.
P.S. I don't really trust winnt or win2k for security either but at least
they have some security features.
