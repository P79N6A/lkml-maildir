preempt_schedule() does sound really, really important.  But, what kinds
of functions can't be kprobed?  It would be nice to give that blacklist
a nice comment on the topic. :)
Also, have you strained your brains to think of other functions that
this should be applied to?  Is it just for functions that are sensitive
and already have an assigned section?  Might be nice to call that out
explicitly.
