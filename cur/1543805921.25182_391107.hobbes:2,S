Ken,
Just to let you know, I've had the same problem on x86-64. It's an incredibly 
rare fault here and I've not been able to reproduce it. However, I cannot 
help but notice that all of the reporters so far have been running the binary 
NVIDIA driver, including myself.
I would not be surprised if running without the NVIDIA driver eliminated the 
problem.
