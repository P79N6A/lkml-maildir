Thanks.  IOW, we are really seeing cacheline bounces - not contention...
I'm still not sure that in the current form patch is a good idea.  The thing
is, existing checks for ->f_count value are bogus in practically all cases;
IMO we should sort that out before making any decision based on the need for
such checks.  Ditto for uses of fcheck() (open-coded or not) in arch/*.
I agree that some form of "postpone freeing and make fget() lockless" would
make sense, but I'd rather clean the area *before* doing that; afterwards it
will be harder and results of cleanup can affect the patches in non-trivial
way.
