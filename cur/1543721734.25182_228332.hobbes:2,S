------- Additional Comments From hadmut@danisch.de  2004-06-18 09:23 -------
I was doing some more tests and found the problem:
I have a script doing the configuration of the aironet card
through the /proc/driver/aironet/eth0 interface. This does not 
work anymore, I can't even change the SSID, which worked with
2.6.6. However, using iwconfig works.
Is the procfs support going to be abandoned?
regards
Hadmut
