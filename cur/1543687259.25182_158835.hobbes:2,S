Doesn't work with 2.4 neither. I'll try the list, but I don't have much
hope for them doing anything. Quoting from the their webpage:
If you have problems, please lobby Asus to release a datasheet.
Unfortunately several others have without success.
Please do not send mail to us asking for better as99127f support.
Which I do ofcourse understand. I just wondered if there was some voodoo
I didnt' understand. Works fine with Motherboard Monitor 5 in Windows.
Thanks :)
Best regards,
