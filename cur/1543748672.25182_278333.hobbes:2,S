Of course, it'll only be a performance issue in the 64-on-32 cases:
the 64-on-64 and 32-on-32 macro should reduce to exactly the present
"entry = *pte".
I've had the impression that Christoph and SGI have to care a great
deal more about ia64 than the others; and as x86_64 advances, so
i386 PAE grows less important.  Just so long as a get_64bit there
isn't a serious degradation from present behaviour, it's okay.
Oh, hold on, isn't handle_mm_fault's pmd without page_table_lock
similarly racy, in both the 64-on-32 cases, and on architectures
which have a more complex pmd_t (sparc, m68k, h8300)?  Sigh.
