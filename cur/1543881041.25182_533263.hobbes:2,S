Okay. Maybe what I suggested is too weak vs. too strong. I didn't
actually have it in mind as a proposal for general use, but maybe it is
good for such. I had more in mind tunability in general, but it's all
good. I'd think some curve gentler in intermediate nice levels and
stronger at the tails might be better.

I vaguely liked specifying the full table, but maybe it's too much
for a real user interface.
4-digit or 5-digit fixed point decimal sounds reasonable.

For the most part, yes. I've been mostly looking at how effectively
the prioritization algorithms work. I'll be wrapping up writing a
testcase to measure all this soon. The basic idea is to take the
weights as inputs somehow and then check to see that they're honored.
What's appropriate for end-users is a very different thing from what
might be appropriate for me. I won't have trouble fiddling with the
code, so please do design around what the best interface for end-users
might be.
