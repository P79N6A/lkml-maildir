That is a relief, retired at last.

It is impressive how elegant a passthrough can be when
one dispenses with a bit of metadata such as per command
timeouts and 3 levels of error messages (i.e. from the
driver, from the link layer and from the SMP target).
I always enjoy getting EIO in errno.
This all seems so frustrating; a LLD injects a
command/frame/whatever into an initiator and waits for
a response or something to happen. Networking code faces
the same scenario and presents it "as is" to the user
space (for any application that cares). Yes, there are
messy details. However in the SCSI subsystem we want to
hide this simple reality with all these wierd and
wonderful abstractions.
