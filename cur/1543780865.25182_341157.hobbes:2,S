I would like to toss in my support to Todd, if he'll take it.  When it comes
to embedded power management concepts, a consistant theme is that people
often question the usefulness, redundancy or complexity of a solution.  This
is perfectly understandable, since such a huge majority of the power
management experts and users are concentrating intently on x86 desktops and
servers.  Thats nobody's fault in particular, just a natural result of a
Wintel world gone mad.
At the PM BOF at OLS, when we started discussing runtime management, somebody
mentioned that one of the problems with RTPM is the complexity.  As an
embedded Linux developer, I hope I speak for the entire embedded community
when I say that we welcome that complexity - we are willing to do anything 
we can do to squeak every single millivolt out of our platforms.
But as a laptop owner, I can see the other side of the coin as well - I don't
know the specific voltages that my laptop uses, and I don't want to know. 
In short, we have different goals, but our hearts are in the the same place.
These same concepts are going to show up more and more in the future, and
eventually somebody is going to start shipping less then optimal solutions,
just to get something to market.  This list can either lend its expertise, or
complain when somebody else gets it wrong.  The second one might seem more
fun, but I hope we can agree its far less productive.. :)
