Wrong migration thread.  The migration thread on CPU 1 has been asked
to push into CPU 0, which is now going down.
Now I've slept on the "do it atomically" idea, I think it's a good
one.  I've even worked out how to maintain the "last thread on CPU is
the idle thread", although I'd need to test in code.

We've been there: we used to send SIGPWR with a new si_info field to
say what CPU it was.  But it turns out not to be useful, so we took it
out.
In practice, any app which wants to scale with # CPUs needs to know
when CPUs are coming up, as well as going down.  Ditto memory, etc.
This means they need to listen for the hotplug event (DBUS anyone?),
or we introduce a SIGRECONF (default ignored).  But AFAICT,
introducing a new signal isn't possible (at least on x86) without
breaking glibc.
Thanks!
Rusty.
