Hi,
I'm planning on writing a SBP-2 driver for Linux. This probably means I
have to interface to the IEEE 1394 driver at the lower level and to the
SCSI driver at the upper level. Is there a template for building a SCSI
driver which includes all the needed entries to register a SCSI driver
and device? Any pointer would be greatly appreciated.
Regards,
Jurgen
