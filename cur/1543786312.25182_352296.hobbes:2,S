I think that would be a bad idea - that is how drives used to work and 
it made the higher level file system code handle odd stuff.
In the field, what we tend to see is that drives that accumulate more 
than a very small percentage of bad blocks (say 100 out of many 
millions) tend to be on their way out and need replacing.

I think that this kind of information is already at hand via smart, 
etc.  You could write an application to query this data base, but to do 
the reverse mapping from block number to file is not easy (i.e., you 
need to fibmap each file in the file system in order to construct the 
mapping).

One thing we do on our boxes is to run a sweep program that does a 
"read-verify" command that allows us to flag bad sectors on the platter 
without transferring data, polluting caches, etc.  A second, repair 
phase goes in and pokes at the suspect sectors trying to force a remap.  
If you have the original data (as in the raid case), you can rewrite the 
sector and all is well.  If not, you need to unmount, re-fsck and try to 
revalidate the contents of individual files (this is where the digital 
signatures comes in handy).

Good idea, but we don't have that reverse mapping at hand for most file 
systems.
