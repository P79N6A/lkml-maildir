It's unclear whether you're just trying to use B for added swap space, or
if you want B to actually run code.
If it's the former, all you have to do is allocate a lot of disk space on B,
and NFS export it to A, and then have A mount it (you might need to
use a loopback mount of a file on the NFS partition and then 'swapon' the
loopback - I dont think swapon will directly take an NFS file)

If you're trying to get B to actually run code, it gets a lot more messy, as
you have to worry about open file descriptors, race conditions, and many
other things.
