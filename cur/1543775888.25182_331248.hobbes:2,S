Subject: kprobe support for memory access watchpoints

I was wondering if there are plans to support a method to register
watchpoints for memory data access with kprobe. On x86, it's possible to
watch for read/write access to arbitrary memory locations via DR memory
registers.
Perhaps register_kprobe() could be modified to support this or perhaps
some new function. This would probably be difficult based on how
differently kprobe works vs. how the DR registers work. I thought I
would send an email because you might be doing or thinking something
similar.
Enjoy,
Jeff
