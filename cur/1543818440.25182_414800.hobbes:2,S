Sorry, for the belated reply. I thought that might be what you refered to,
however I think this is going to cause additional problems. The powerpc
code which is effected uses the CROSS32CC which may, or may not be the
same compiler as used by the host cc. This means that it could also have
different capabilities, and the worst scenario in this specific
situation would be where the hostcc didn't support ssp, but the
cross32cc did, and had it enforced.
I don't think this is the right approach, and keeping it isolated to the
boot code makes more sense to me.
