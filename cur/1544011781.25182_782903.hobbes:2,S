Thanks a lot Eric (and thanks for .s files you sent me privately).
At first glance this all is very strange.

So, when the task exits its has a timer in ->posix_timers.
However, this means sys_timer_create() must return 0, the code
is very simple
	spin_lock_irq(&current->sighand->siglock);
	new_timer->it_process = process;
	list_add(&new_timer->list, &current->signal->posix_timers);
	spin_unlock_irq(&current->sighand->siglock);
	return 0;
and nobody else adds the timer to ->posix_timers.

according to above, timer_create() always returns -EXXX ?
I'll try to re-produce and investigate tomorrow.
