I was quoting the spec and I thought that the suggestion is implicit -- 
the specification defines what happens only when processess are in place. 
If the application uses POSIX threads in combination with locks, it is 
going to receive undefined behavior.

- either we can add a special fcntl() Linux-specific flag, that will ask 
  the kernel not to perform deadlock detection. Any application that is 
  combining threads and posix locks (and thus IMHO asking for undefined 
  behavior) could use this flag and not receive EDEADLK any more
- or we can add some heuristics here-and-there to track which 
  current->files are shared and which are not, and do not return EDEADLK 
  in the case of shared ->files (could be a little bit tricky)
