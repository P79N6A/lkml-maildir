Sure.  Appreciated.  Outlining the thinking in the other direction
struct pid is supposed to be the pid representation in the kernel.
All of the pid_t stuff really should be pushed as close to the
kernel/user boundary as possible.  The closer I get to that ideal
the more cases I find that we need to handle like /proc/timer_stats
and the closer we get to having a complete pid namespace. <pant pant pant>
A struct pid is also now all you pin (besides the inevitable file,
dentry, inode trio) when you open a directory in /proc.  So the
task can be freed.  Which removed some low-mem exhaustion scenarios
when we introduced it.
