Eh?  I was suggesting that the _default_ just work as quite a few
people expect:
	$ insmod audio_driver
In fact, forget about "volume".  Just have a "silent" parameter that
defaults to 0, and determines whether the device starts silent or
loads preset defaults.  Make it a core audio thing rather than a
per-driver thing, too.  "silent=1" in /etc/modules.conf self-evidently
answers the FAQ, too :)
