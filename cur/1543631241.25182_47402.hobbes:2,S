Hi
Noticed that while trying to compile 2.5.15 and 2.5.16, then some of the drivers
(forgot which - maybe i2c-something it self) requires existence of linux/i2c-old.h,
but linux/i2c-old.h seems to have been excluded. Adding linux/i2c-old.h enables
a succesfull compiling of the kernel, but maybe it was left out intentionally.
