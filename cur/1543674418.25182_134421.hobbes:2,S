Hi,
I am in the unfortunate position to run a production server with 2.5.66 
since the SuperMicro CSE-742S-500 has no suitable APIC support in the 
2.4.x series. Why I do not run 2.5.69? The machine panics twice a day.
2.5.66 dies once a day with "kernel panic: Aiee, killing interrupt 
handler" in fs/xfs/pagebuf/page_buf.c:1287. The reason is an "invalid 
operand:0000 #5" on CPU:0 with "EIP:0060:[<c024f059>] Not tainted". In 
my case slapd from the OpenLDAP package caused the crash.
I have an 39320 Dual U320 SCSI controller in the machine with a Overland 
PowerLoader LTO-1 (17 slots) and a Infortrend IFT 6300-12 IDE-Raid with 
one 700G XFS volume configured.
Currently I am not able to backup the machine using Arkeia 5.1.7 without 
running one backup process on the local machine in a long-term disk 
sleep or getting a panic.
I'd like to get in touch with an person actively working on the XFS or 
APIC stuff to discuss how I can contribute to stabilize the APIC code 
for the Supermicro board and how to analyze/fix the XFS problem. I dot 
not want to file Bugzilla entries at this time before I cannot be sure 
that I missed an obvious solution.
Looking forward,
Andreas Heilwagen
