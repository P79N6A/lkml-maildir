i have the creative sb live card, (emu10k1.0) its worked with
every other kernel even 2.4.6. i get the following messages
with insmod.
emu10k1.o: init_module: No such device
Hint: insmod errors can be caused by incorrect module parameters, including
invalid IO or IRQ parameters
any suggestions? thanks again
