Well, plugging them in is one case. But what is plugged in, will
eventually be unplugged as well. That will not require probing.
Now let's be conservative and assume 16KB unswappable memory
per task. Now we take the famous 4000 disk case. 64MB. A lot
but probably not deadly. But multiply this by 15 and the machine is
absolutely dead.
