 I think we must panic() for an unknown bus that has an I/O APIC interrupt
routed from that is marked as "conforming to the bus spec" in the MP
table.  Trying to assume any defaults is unsafe and is not any better --
we may guess them upon the first interested user reports such a problem.
This should trigger on a small amount of unusual system if any at all.
 For any other case we may try to handle interrupts according to
information provided in the MP table.

 We cannot asume any bus is of any type -- it may be ISA or PCI or
whatever.  Jean-Marc actually reported: 
Bus #0 is PCI
Bus #1 is PCI
Bus #18 is XPRESS
Bus #19 is EISA
a few days ago (I admit I should have replied by then but this week was
completely crazy for me so I just marked it for later reference).  So this
will not help him either.
 We may add an "unknown" entry to our bus list and only choke upon I/O IRQ
parsing under conditions I've outlined above.  We may print the bus name
to the log for user pleasure anyway, as it's stored as ASCII in the MP
table.

 The system may be unusable due to an IRQ flood for example (just like
when I set my 8254 IRQ as level-triggered in the I/O APIC when simulating
an MCA configuration). 
 Jean-Marc: feel free to send me the output of `dmesg -s 32768' as I
outlined in the previous mail -- I'll study it after the next week (or
immediately, if you somehow manage it to be delivered in a few minutes ;-) 
).
