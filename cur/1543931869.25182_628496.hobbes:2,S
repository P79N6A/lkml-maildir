I'll be gone all day today, so it may take me awhile to test. I tried
real quick to blacklist it, but fedora isn't making it easy,
apparently it's depended on by quite a few things and I can't even
force unload them. I'll build latest wireless git without ipv6 late
tonight. Also, the logs may be incomplete, they're probably missing
when the device first associates with the router. Not sure if I should
include that.
I'm thankful that at least we're moving in some direction to solve
this bug, thanks again.
