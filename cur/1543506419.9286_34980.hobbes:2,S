Hi!
Please, stop this discussion. It is offtopic for linux kernel, and
cure seem to be worse than disease. davem cares about the list, and I
think he does that reasonably. We seen pretty low ammount of spam in
past years.

I can see that need.
I actually use 4+ different email addresses. And no I do not want to
configure all machines I use to fake same From: address. I just avoid
lists that require me to mail from the same address I'm subscribed
from.
