You are so smart!  I never even looked at the side to see whether the floppy 
disk access light was on.
The floppy disk access light (that's part of the floppy drive) was on as well 
as the system disk access light (I almost never use the floppy drive).

You are correct.  "modprobe floppy" restored the operation of the disk access 
light to normal.

Hmm.  LILO bug then I guess.
