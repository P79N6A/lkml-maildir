Jean,
I for one will greatly miss your knowledge and helpful hints when I
work on hardware monitoring drivers. I hope you find success in all
the things you do!
I understand the difficult position you're in, and if there's any way
I could convince you to stay, I would. Maybe you would be willing to
answer a few low-bandwidth questions from time to time? Or jump on to
#linux-sensors every once in a while?
Either way, thanks for everything!
Cheers,
David
