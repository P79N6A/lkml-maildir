Now tell us how someone who isn't a VM developer can tell if that's bad or
good. Is it good because it didn't swap more than it needed to, or bad
because there were more things it could have swapped to make more buffer
room? 
Serious question, tuning the -aa VM sometimes makes the swap use higher,
even as the response to starting small jobs while doing kernel compiles or
mkisofs gets better. I don't normally tune -ac kernels much, so I can't
comment there.
