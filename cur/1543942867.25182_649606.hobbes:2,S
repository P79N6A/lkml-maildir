pick up the threaded softirq patches from -rt, those move all softirqs 
processing into kernel threads. I'd suggest to extend those via 
wakeup-from-remote functionality - it fits the construct quite 
naturally. You should also be able to directly observe any performance 
impact of threaded softirq handlers. (and if you find any, let me know 
so that we can make it faster :-)
