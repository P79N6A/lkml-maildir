Well i think a problem has risen due to people allocating huge ramdisks with
sizes over 128Mb RAM. This is biting into the virtual memory management
system. For people using the ramdisk driver as a permanent runtime
root filesystem, maybe create a boot option : 
ramdisk=persistent	(or =solid or =sticky )
