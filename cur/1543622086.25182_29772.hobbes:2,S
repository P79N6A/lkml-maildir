well, how do you migrate the task from an IRQ context? This is the
fundamental question. A task can only be removed from the runqueue if it's
not running currently. (the only exception is schedule() itself.)
even if it worked, this adds a 1/(2*HZ) average latency to the migration.
I wanted to have something that is capable of migrating tasks 'instantly'.
(well, as 'instantly' as soon the migrated task can be preempted.) I also
wanted to have a set_cpus_allowed() interface that guarantees that the
task has migrated to the valid set.
i'm doing one more variation wrt. migration threads: instead of the
current method of waking up the target CPU's migration thread and 'kicking
off' the migrated task from its current CPU, it's much cleaner to do the
following:
 - every migration thread has maximum priority.
 - in set_cpus_allowed() we wake up the migration thread on the *source*
   CPU.
 - the migration thread preempts the migrated thread on the source CPU -
   and it can just remove the migrated task from the local runqueue. (if
   the task is still there at that point.)
this is even simpler and does not change p->state in any way.
