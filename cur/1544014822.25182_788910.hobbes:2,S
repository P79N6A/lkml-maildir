I like autotuning, so that sounds like an intriguing approach. It's worked 
for us before (ie VM).
That said, 30 seconds sounds like a _loong_ time for something like this. 
I'd use the normal 5-second dirty_writeback_interval for this: if we can't 
clean the whole queue in that normal background writeback interval, then 
we try to lower the tagets. We already have that "congestion_wait()" thing 
there, that would be a logical place, methinks.
I'm not sure how to raise them, though. We don't want to raise any limits 
just because the user suddenly went idle. I think the raising should 
happen if we hit the sync/async ratio, and we haven't lowered in the last 
30 seconds or something like that.
