Sounds very nice indeed. Just happened to do a driver in a similar
status, where the vendor did not want to make the specs and other
stuff open, but was in a position to support an OSS driver for the
STB0899 demodulator driver from ST Microelectronics
I think many vendors will be ready to jump in.
the STB0899 demodulator driver is now available at
http://linuxtv.org/hg/~manu/stb0899-c5
It needs some fixes with regards to our DVB API. (bumping it up to 3.2
from 3.1) It's almost ready to rock now, with new delivery systems.
regards,
manu
