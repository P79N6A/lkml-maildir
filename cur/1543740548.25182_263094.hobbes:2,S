Okay, will do.

Not sure yet -- still testing, though I've already done an #if 0 on it.

Not there in the 2.6.xx version.
And in 2.4.xx.. why is idedisk_open() examining vendor-specific
fields of the IDENTIFY data, anyway?  Very very unsafe.
I put the above one-liner workaround (drive->id->csfo) into delkin_cb
to bypass the problems it creates for now, until idedisk_open gets fixed.
Normally I'd just send a patch to fix idedisk_open(), but since I don't
even understand what it is trying to do, it would be safer for whoever
put that code there to have a second look.  Especially since 2.4.xx
is supposed to be stable now -- if it ain't broke, don't break it.  :)
Cheers
