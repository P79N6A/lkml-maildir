When I tried it, usb-storage would not load with unresolved symbols.
It happens if child (usu_probe_thread) runs ahead of its parent
(usb_usual_init -> usb_register -> usu_probe). It's entirely possible,
depending on your scheduler.
I hate this down-up trick too, so if you have a better idea, I'm all ears.
