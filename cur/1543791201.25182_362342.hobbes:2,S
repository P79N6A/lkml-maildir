No, we need both events.  When you need to tell the user when it is
safe to disconnect the storage device, the event from detach_mnt() is
useless - it happens too early.  In fact, even the current way of
sending the event from kill_block_super() is broken, because the event
is generated before generic_shutdown_super() and sync_blockdev(), and
writing out cached data may take some time.
We could try to emit busy/free events from bd_claim() and
bd_release(); this would be triggered by most "interesting" users
(even opens with O_EXCL), but not by things like volume_id.

This assumes that there will be only one process per namespace which
will call poll() on /proc/mounts.  Even though someone may argue that
it is the right approach (have a single process which watches
/proc/mounts and broadcasts updates to other interested processes,
e.g., over dbus), with the above implementation any unprivileged user
can call poll() and interfere with the operation of that designated
process.
