hi,
I have a D-Link DFE-530TX Rev A, PCI ethernet card, but it refuses 
to work.
I have looked at 
http://www.scyld.com/network/index.html#pci
 
which sugests using the via-rhine driver.
I did this and compiled it into the kernel. It detects it at boot (via-
rhine v1.08-LK1.1.6 8/9/2000 Donald Becker) but says the 
hardware address (mac address?) is 00-00-00-00-00-00.
The card is not a DF-530TX or a DFE-530TX+ AFAIK.
www.d-link.com don't do linux drivers or say anything about linux.
The card works perfect with d-link drivers in win98 and w2k.
Whats the differance between via-rhine in 2.2.18 and 2.4.1?
Can any one help?
Thanks for reading
tom
(can u cc replys to me)
Some more info:-
pci device 00:0a.0
io=0xD400
irq=9
linux-2.4.1
glibc-2.2.1

ps I have tryed to exaust all prosabilitys before posting here, and I 
am sorry if this is stupid, its my first post to linux-kernel!
