I'm not all that familiar with s2ram.  Any feel for why the behaviour
would have changed from the old setup code at all?  Since the setup code
isn't entered on resume from STR (unlike resume from STD), as far as I
know, there can only be "some little bit of state" hanging around.
If not then perhaps we should try to get a dump of the real-mode state
area for both kernels (which would need a patch, unfortunately.)
