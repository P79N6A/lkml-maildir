Hey all
I'm using netperf to perform TCP throughput tests via the localhost
interface. This is being done on a SMP machine. I'm forcing the
netperf server and client to run on the same core. However, for any
packet sizes below 523 the throughput is much lower compared to the
throughput when the packet sizes are greater than 524.

The chances are i'm being stupid and there is an obvious reason for
this, but when i put  the server and client on different cores i don't
see this effect.
Any help explaining this will be greatly appreciated.
