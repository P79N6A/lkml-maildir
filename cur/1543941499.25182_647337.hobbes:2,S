random-qa found an early bootup hang on 32-bit (config attached).
i bisected it down to this patch of yours. It's a bit large so it's not 
obvious what is happening. Could you please keep patches that do 
functional changes smaller? It's not a problem if the non-functional or 
trivial restructuring patches are larger, but it's a killer for these 
functional ones. I've dropped this one for now, and all the dependent 
patches as well:
Subject: x86: move pud/pgd functions into common asm/pgalloc.h
Subject: x86: move all the pgd_list handling to one place
Subject: x86: rename paravirt_alloc_pt etc after the pagetable structure
Subject: x86: add pud_alloc for 4-level pagetables
Subject: x86/pgtable.h: demacro ptep_set_access_flags
Subject: x86/pgtable.h: demacro ptep_test_and_clear_young
Subject: x86/pgtable.h: demacro ptep_clear_flush_young
