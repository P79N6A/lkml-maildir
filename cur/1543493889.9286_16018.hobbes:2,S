I certainly plan on investigating it.  I currently have the buffer
pointer in struct page, set up as a generic pointer.  So you can either
use it's bits directly to keep track of what is dirty on a page.  Or
you can allocate a structure to have such things as a per page list
of dirty places (like nfs does now).
For the start however the buffer cache will remain for the fs metadata.
But the fs metadata should be small enough that even if
cached a little inefficiently we shouldn't have space problems.
At least that's my hunch.
