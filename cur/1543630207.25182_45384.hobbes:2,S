Just take a closer look on sigaction(2). The field sa_sigaction and
flags SA_SIGINFO in sa_flags can help to identify the source of the
SIGBUS.
SIGACTION(2)        Linux Programmer's Manual        SIGACTION(2)
...
       the  sender  of  the  POSIX.1b  signal.   SIGILL,  SIGFPE,
       SIGSEGV and SIGBUS fill in si_addr with the address of the
       fault.  SIGPOLL fills in si_band and si_fd.
...
       si_code indicates why this  signal  was  sent.   It  is  a
       value,  not  a bitmask.  The values which are possible for
       any signal are listed in this table:
...
       |                  SIGBUS                    |
       +-----------+--------------------------------+
       |BUS_ADRALN | invalid address alignment      |
       +-----------+--------------------------------+
       |BUS_ADRERR | non-existent physical address  |
       +-----------+--------------------------------+
       |BUS_OBJERR | object specific hardware error |
