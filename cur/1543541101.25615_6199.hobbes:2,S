Taking a further look at your oops, I've found out that your system really
oopsed at __find_page(), and that the page passed to this function had a
invalid list pointer (->next_hash).
The only problem I found which _could_ cause that is because we did not
locked the page before starting IO on sync_page_buffers(). 
Here goes the patch to fix this:
