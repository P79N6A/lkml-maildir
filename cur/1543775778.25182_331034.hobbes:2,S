One filesystem that exists right now.
/proc, as people have made clear, was originally implemented on *one* 
"non-standard" Unix.  Others then copied it.  I see no reason why if 
/meta is a good idea, and programs start using it, that other FSes won't 
implement it.

"sane" -- I assume you mean "traditional".
Well, yeah.  So?
How big a program do you need to create a new interface to an existing 
system?
Consider:  BitTorrent has at least three interfaces that I can remember 
at the moment.  btdownloadgui.py, btdownloadcurses.py, 
btdownloadheadless.py.
Are you saying that btdownloadgui.py was so much work if you start from 
btdownloadcurses.py that there should be no GTK library, because it 
takes so much work to convert existing curses apps to GTK?
Remember, even if I have GTK installed, I can still get to my curses 
apps, and they may not even know that GTK exists.  Even if I have /meta 
enabled, I can still use my POSIX apps, and they may not even know that 
/meta exists.

Linux over POSIX, I think.  Because Linux is big and open-source, not
beacuse POSIX is so great.

I agree with that, at least.  But Linux is also what it is today in 
large part because "I don't need $FEATURE, so it should be kept out" 
isn't a particularly good argument either.
