But you are getting over 3/4 million files in one directory on a 1K
blocksize system, and you really shouldn't be using 1K blocks on a
filesystem under that big a load.  Is it just to reduce tail block
fragmentation?  That's what tail merging is for - it does a much better
job than shrinking the block size.
But if you are *determined* to use 1K blocks and have more than 1/2
million files in one directory then I suppose a 3rd level is what you
need.  The uniform-depth tree still works just fine and still doesn't
need to be rebalanced - it's never out of balance.
