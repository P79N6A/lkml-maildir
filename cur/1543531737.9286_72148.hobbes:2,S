Since there is an on going thread on 32G drives, I thought
it might be a good time to bring up a problem I've been
having with a 30G Western Digital IDE drive.
Using the manufacturers DOS boot application, the drive
info looks like this:
              C     H   S    MB
Default     59598   16  63  30760  
Currently   16383   16  63   8455
Rom BIOS     3740  255  63  30764
When I boot into Linux it sees the drive at the "current"
settings, which I believe are getting forced in when
I use fdisk to create the partition table (cfdisk can't
deal with it at all until I do this)
I've tried changing CHS in fdisk and it seems to take
them... but if I exit and restart the program, everything
is back to the values in the "Currently" line again. I
discussed this some weeks ago on linux-hardware and have
not progressed towards a solution yet.
Something, somewhere is forcing this drive to think it
is 8G instead of 30G. It ain't the BIOS, so it seems
to be driver related or perhaps a failing in fdisk. 
I can kill the partition table, go into the DOS app
and reset the drive, but it goes right back as soon
as I boot.
The system in question is far from a phone line and
has no external connectivity, so updates are painful.
But it is running 2.2.14 kernel with debian potato dist
as of November 1999.
I tried a 2.3.x kernel as well and that didn't solve
the problem either, although I limited my tests because
I was getting some error messages that were worrisome
and this is not a system I wish to lose a file system
on!
