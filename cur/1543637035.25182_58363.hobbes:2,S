Hi
In the IDE Protocol, only 1 DMA transfer can take place on the bus at
one time.
So if the IDE  bus is busy doing the DMA transfer for 1 drive, the other
drive cannot receive any commands.
I guess what does happen is that the IDE driver in the kernel doesnt
distribute commands in a "fair" manner between drive 0 & drive 1. If it
receives commands for drive 0, it keeps sending those commands to the
drive 0, one after the other, without checking if there is a command for
drive 1.
A driver distributing commands in a "fair" manner would send 1 command
to drive 0, check if there is a command for drive 1, if there is, it
would send a command to drive 1, then send the next command to drive 0
and so on...
The above is a guess...would anyone care to verify?
Thanks
Aniket
