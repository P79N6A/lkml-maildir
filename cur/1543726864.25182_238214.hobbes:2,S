Subject: kernel freeze when mounting dvd

I'm running FC2 with kernel 2.6.5. When I try to mount
DVD disks my system freezes. Mounting CDs works just
fine. DVD works OK on Windows. After freeze there are
no messages in the logs, however if I do it in
runlevel 3 I see an endless loop of printk's running
on the screen saying something about not being able to
read some block. I can't cat-n-paste the message
because it does not go to any log. And I don't use
SCSI emulation, I just mount it as /dev/hdd.  My DVD
drive is LITE-ON DVDRW SOHW-812S.
Any ideas ? Thanks .
