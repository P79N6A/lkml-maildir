NAK.
First, such an interface should be obsoleted by first making an entry
to Documentation/feature-removal-schedule.txt and waiting for some months.
Second, security modules that cannot be loaded/unloaded can just marked
so and the LSM interface kept as-is.
You are aware of the out of tree users, like AppArmor and other security
modules and there are also several antivirus modules like dazuko, mcafee
(got riddance for the latter, but in general) using LSM.
Ciao, Marcus
