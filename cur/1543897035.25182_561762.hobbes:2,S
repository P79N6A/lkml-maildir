Humm...  Right, so __builtin_offsetof() needs special treatment too.
Oh, bugger.  Is
	offsetof(struct foo, a.x[n])
a documented extension?  I _know_ that it's not promised by 7.17,
but gcc eats it (and obviously that sucker requires extra treatment
in that case).
Parsing __builtin_offsetof() arguments is going to be fun ;-/  Right
now sparse has it as a predefined macro, but if we want to do that
kind of analysis, we need to really parse it.  OTOH, that's not
such a big deal...  Parser would need to accept
	ident ( \[ expr \] | . ident )*
there, typecheck would walk down, check types and find offsets of
struct members on the way down and build expression on the way
back (e.g. in form of constant + sum of stuff from [...]), doing
evaluate_expression() on each index and slapping Int_const_expr
on created nodes accordingly.  In the end, slap the Int_const_expr
on resulting expression in obvious way.  expand would work as usual,
no interesting nodes surviving by that point...
OK, that's doable and probably should be split into implementation
of __builtin_offsetof() (sans Int_const_expr logics) and Int_const_expr
parts merged into the patch that does all handling of integer constant
expressions.
Joy.  OK, folks, disregard 16/16 in the current form; everything prior
to it stands on its own.
