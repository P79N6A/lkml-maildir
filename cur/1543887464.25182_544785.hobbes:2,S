Most of my homework is done.  There are six items left plus another five
I believe should not get changed.
Changed:
o Kconfig description updated
o Spaces converted to tabs in Makefile
o Sorted/seperated #includes
o structures are __packed instead of packed, #define removed
o removed TRACE()
o 32bit magic is u instead of ull now
o #defines aligned
o Removed obsolete #defines, documented rest
o LOGFS_SUPER and LOGFS_INODE are inline functions now
o removed alloc_disk_sum and free_disk_sum
o moved dir_callback up
o removed pointless cast from max() parameter
o moved LOGFS_LINK_MAX to header
o license headers
o removed logfs_writepage()
o introduced and documented LOGFS_SEGMENT_RESERVE
o documented completion dance in mtderase()
o removed isbad() check from mtderase()
o removed logfs_device_getpage() and logfs_cached_read()
o resurrected code to pick correct device
o removed beXX typedefs
o removed safe_read()
o removed wrapper in logfs_cleanup_gc()
o device_read() returns error
o renamed logfs_alloc_blocks() to match current implementation
o kerneldoc comments for structures
o removed logfs_compress_none and logfs_uncompress_none
o Split header
o move fsck behind debug option
Changed many times (and I sincerely hope not to have missed any):
o removed // comments, usually dead code
o added newline between variable declarations and code
o moved tail comments
o minor code cleanups
o changed comment style
o added loglevels to printk
Unchanged:
o enum for OBJ_TOP_JOURNAL and friends
  Afaics all the potential enums end up being converted through cpu_to_64XX,
  I'll have to see if that causes more problems than the enums can hope to
  solve.
o generic function for logfs_type()
o generic helper for logfs_prepare_write()
o removed EOF
o error handling
o move rootdir generation back to mkfs
Won't happen (unless I get convinced to do otherwise):
o lowercase LOGFS_SUPER and LOGFS_INODE
  These simply match the common pattern used is many Linux filesystems.
o remove "extern"
  For structures, this keyword actually serves a purpose and makes sense.
  On the other hand, it is completely bogus for functions and I won't be
  bullied into adding bogus crud either.
o Move fs/logfs/Locking to Documentation/
  At least JFFS2 has such documentation in its own directory as well.
  I can see good arguments for either side and no strong consensus.  While
  I ultimately just don't case, doing nothing is a good option in cases
  of great uncertainty.
o change (void*) to "proper" cast
  Neither variant is much better than the other.  I'm open for suggestions
  to completely remove the casts, though.
o Change LOGFS_BUG() and LOGFS_BUG_ON() to inline functions
  These are macros for very much the same reasons BUG() and BUG_ON() are.
