And the list of applications which do
	sock = socket(...);
	map = mmap(...);
	write(sock, map, bytes);
are?  There are not very many that I know of and if you look carefully
at the bandwidth graphs in LMbench you'll see why.  There is a cross
over point where mmap becomes cheaper but it used to be around 16-64K.
I don't know what it is now, I doubt it's moved much.  I can check if
you really want.
