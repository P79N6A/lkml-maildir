"channel bonding" can handle cases whereby you lose a single NIC or port -- 
but typically channeling means that you need multiple paths into a single 
ethernet switch.
single ethernet switch = single point of failure.
hence, from a high-availability (HA) perspective, you're better off 
connecting N NICs into N switches -- and then load-balance (multipath) 
across those.
an interesting side-note is that channel-bonding doesn't necessarily mean 
higher performance.
i haven't looked at linux's channel-bonding, but many NICs on higher-end 
servers offer this as an option, and when enabled, you end up with multiple 
NICs with the same MAC address.  typically only one NIC is used for one 
direction of traffic.

:-)
most "storage" people care more about latency than they do about raw 
performance.  coalescing packets = bad for latency.
i figure there has to be middle ground somewhere -- implement both and have 
it as a config option.
decent GE cards will do coalescing themselves anyway.
cheers,
lincoln.
