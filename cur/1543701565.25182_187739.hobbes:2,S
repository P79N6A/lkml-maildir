Let me begin by pointing out that I was a proponent of devfs from when
it first got written.

I'm thinking maybe this is just fine.

Every way of doing things is just another say of doing it. Location
based naming has it's major issues. It's solved by UUID or LABEL, so
device naming is just a matter of preference anyway. You can change it
with udev, IIRC. You could not with devfs. Chances are you use devfsd
anyway, right?

No one is saying it is currently perfect for everyone, however, it suits
many people just fine. devfs went through the same thing and this is an
invalid argument when debating the technical merit of either.

By the time devfs goes away enough testing will have happened. Don't
look for it to go away within 2.6.
