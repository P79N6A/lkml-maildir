I like the general idea of this patch set, however..

Perhaps this is something that needs to be looked at more closely and
made more generic? There are many ranged page table walkers that aren't
so performance critical that the function call cost would cause too much
pain. ioremap_page_range() comes to mind, and there's bound to be others.
This would also help people to get the pte map/unmap right, which seems
to pop up from time to time as well..
