Subject: driver support for Chelsio T210 10Gb ethernet in 2.6.x

The in-kernel Chelsio cxgb driver in 2.6.19-rc5 is version 2.1.1 and only 
supports the N110 and N210 10Gb ethernet boards.  The current driver 
available from Chelsio[1] is 2.1.4a and supports the T110 and T210 series 
boards, but is only available against 2.6.16.  Any chance of an update to 
the in-kernel driver for 2.6.20 to support the T* series cards?
