The '*' is expanded by your shell to be a command-line that has
39,000 file-names in it! It is probably way too long for a command-
line (argument list).
The easiest way is to do:
mv -f a* /usr/local/www/images
mv -f b* /usr/local/www/images
mv -f c* /usr/local/www/images
... until the remaining argument list is short enough for the '*' only.
You can also do a loop in a shell if the shell's internal buffer is
big enough for the expanded '*' ...
for x in * ; do mv -f $x /usr/local/www/images ; done
