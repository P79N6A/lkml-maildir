You don't need the frame buffer; cards typically have text mode
fonts upto 80x50. The node numbers vary, but you can find out yours

Normally most of it bogus. I had hoped to address this with the dwarf2
unwinder, which tends to filter them out nicely,
but Linus unfortunately has developed an quite irrational aversion against it and 
it's not in.
But the problem is with bogus entries in there you have no guarantee
that the first of your call trace is any useful -- it might be all bogus.
So i don't really think your option makes much sense.
Another way would be to not dump addresses and use multiple entries
per line again. I guess that would make more sense as an option.
