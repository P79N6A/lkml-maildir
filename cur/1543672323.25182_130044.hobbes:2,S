   crap.  Modules deal with per-device and per-mount objects.  If a module
   cannot use kmalloc_per_cpu on behalf of the primary object which it manages
   then the facility is simply not useful to modules.
Ok then.
Please address the ia64 concerns then :-)  It probably means we
have to stay with the dereferencing stuff...  at which point you
might as well use normal kmalloc() and smp_processor_id() indexing
inside of modules.
