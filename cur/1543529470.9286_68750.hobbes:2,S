I know that this stuff is horribly broken (that's why there's a notice to
use Andy's tools instead if you want to try ACPI). I'll try to fix this in
the next time (actually most of this is already fixed in CVS, but I don't
want to make a new release before I've upgraded CVS to the latest acpid).
I'm going to take the .deb's offline now, to avoid further confusion.

The man page is also on the fixme list. Stay tuned. :-)
