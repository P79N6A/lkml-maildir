I have a Sony VAIO laptop.  When I plug in my USB keyboard, I can use both
it and the built-in keyboard.  However, it boots up with the USB mouse in,
I can only use the USB mouse, not the built-in scratch-pad mouse.
(Other than that, the USB stuff seems to work great!)
Is this expected behaviour?
If not, I'll send in a detailed report on my system...
Thanks,
Ben
