Got a dual core Athlon 64 X2 on an Asus board using NVidia chipset and 
getting lost ticks. The software clock of course is totally messed up. 
I've scanned google for a solution and see others complaining about bad 
code in the SMM BIOS. I have the latest bios and whatever they need to 
fix - isn't.
So - what do I do to make it work?
Yes - I compiled the kernel 2.6.13.1 and used a speed of 100 - the 
lowest setting - and that did help some. But - the problem needs to go away.
If I compile a kermel without any of the power management at all - will 
that fix the problem? I need a work around.
Thanks in advance.
