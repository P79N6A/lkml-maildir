Why call them "broken"? Better to delete that word.

Yes. I have seen one such report. Have there been more?
The Synaptics multiplexing proposal uses 0xf0, 0x56, 0xa4
to activate and 0xf0, 0x56, 0xa5 to deactivate.
In both cases the replies must be 0xf0, 0x56, version.
Thus, I suppose one might get a more robust detection
by checking that both the activation and deactivation
sequences yield the same version.
