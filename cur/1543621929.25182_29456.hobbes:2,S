Afaiks, not to hdlc or not today. :o)
So far SIOCGOFIGURE mainly benefits to hdlc family of protocols. IMHO
if_settings.type should be enough (famous words) to make the difference
between the various l2/l1 informations. Others protocols will still be able 
to store their data in a strict order behind it when/if they want to.
Patch of the day. Same layout as the last time. Applies after 2.5.5 +
latest Krzysztof's patch. Krzysztof, does diff-2.5.5-kh-mapomme-1 address 
your issues ?
