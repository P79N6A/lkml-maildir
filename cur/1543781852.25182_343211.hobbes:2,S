Hey, if anybody has suggestions on names - they are very welcome ;-)
FWIW, I'd rather take page_symlink(), page_symlink_inode_operations,
page_put_link(), page_follow_link_light(), page_readlink(), page_getlink(),
generic_readlink() and vfs_readlink() to the same place where these guys
would live.  They all belong together and none of them has any business
in fs/namei.c.  Options: fs/libfs.c or separate library since fs/libfs.c
is getting crowded.  Linus, do you have any objections to that or suggestions
on filename here?
