It's very hard to do that.  What should be the timeout for requests,
so that valid filesystems don't break, yet it's not possible to do a
fairly ugly DoS?  It's almost impossible I'd say.

That's what I did.  See the recent documentation and code patches
(cc-d to -fsdevel).  I'm pretty convinced it's the right thing to do.
OK, I was with the previous solution too, but anyway ;)
