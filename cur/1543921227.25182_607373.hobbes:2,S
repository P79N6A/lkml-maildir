Yes I know. The question we tried to answer was: is the bug in 2.6.23 or was
it introduced after 2.6.23, as kvm.git  already contains lots of post 2. 6.23 
stuff.
Current state is:
kvm.git with tag 2.6.23-rc6 works for days without a problem.
2.6.23.1 vanilla has survived and is currently still under test.
kvm.git tag master killed our filesystem at least three times.since monday.
I will continue to bang on 2.6.23.1 to see if its really fine. After that,
maybe I will try to bisect on kvm.git, but this will take quite a long time,
given that we had to reinstall the system due to this error.
