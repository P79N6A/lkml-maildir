You're correct that dynamic major/minor numbers are sufficient for most 
purposes, but embedded users really need their static numbers.  As for ripping 
out major/minor numberings, that's a non-starter.  Too much of our device 
management infrastructure is based around this numbering scheme, and there isn't 
really anything wrong with it to justify breaking everything in the change.
As a rule of thumb, if you ever find yourself wondering why we still support 
doing statically something we can now do dynamically, the answer is generally 
that doing it dynamically sucks for embedded.
