Whether drivers have bugs or not should never hold up a release.  The
way Linux is today, since drivers are in the main tree (true they can be
built as modules), this means Linux has to wait for every single driver
to function before a kernel can be considered stable.  If MS or Novell
did their development this, W2K release cycles would be 5-6 years since
they have a huge base of  drivers.  
A stable binary interface.  There already is one with the
register_blkdev() functions, etc.  The drivers are already doing this
part, but they should not be lock step syncrhonized with the kernel. 
The kernel proper could be separate.  Same with the LAN and Disk
sybsystems -- they also could be instrumented as modules.  A lot of this
is already there today, it's just a question of procedures and how stuff
gets managed.   The driver function table has not changed for years, and
there's still the freedom to change stuff.  Easy -- add a version number
to these function tables so when the kernel loads, it will know which
version table to swap in -- then you can change kernel/driver
interaction all you want and still support all the drivers.
2.4 has fewer Level I and Level II bugs at this momemtn than either W2K
or NetWare typically do when they ship.  WHat's different about Linux is
that the source code is public so the whole planet knows about these
bugs.  I think 2.4.0 is ready now to ship -- it's in better shape than
most commercial W2K releases are....

Well.  It gets done today, so who is doing this today?

Linus stated in an email a month or so back modularity was something he
really would like to see happen.  Let's see just how serious he really
is when 2.5 comes down the pipe.
