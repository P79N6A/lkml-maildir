Sigh.  I saw the volume of email last time and though "gee, glad I wasn't
cc'ed on that lot".
Supporting 8k stacks is a small amount of code and nobody has seen a need
to make changes in there for quite a long time.  So there's little cost to
keeping the existing code.
And the existing code is useful:
a) people can enable it to confirm that their weird crash was due to a
   stack overflow.
b) If I was going to put together a maximally-stable kernel for a
   complex server machine, I'd select 8k stacks.  We're still just too
   squeezy, and we've had too many relatively-recent overflows, and there
   are still some really deep callpaths in there.
