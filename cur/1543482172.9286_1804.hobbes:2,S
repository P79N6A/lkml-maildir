Sorry if someone else has already reported this (I'm finding it very
difficult to keep up with the traffic on this list).
The major changes to sound for ESS chips made in 2.2.0-pre8 (why
couldn't it wait for 2.3.x?) mean that my old ESS688 no longer
initialises properly.  I hear a slight click from the speakers when the
modules load but get no output when playing .au or .wav files, whatever
the mixer setting for "synth".  CD audio still works fine, so do mic and
line inputs.
I'll be contacting Rolf Fokkens with more details once I've unravelled
what's (not) what.  This is just to warn anyone else who might get
caught: since it can't affect very many people I'm not really expecting
it to be fixed in the released 2.2.0.
Dan
