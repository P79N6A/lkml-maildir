Yes, the use of iotcl need SOCK_RAW socket. But I am not aware about 
iotcl with RFCOMM (just whit HCI) and even less under 2.5 .
But I saw in 2.4 that it is for the TTY RFCOMM module, I think it should 
only  be used in this module.
If it is while your are using TTY over bluetooth, ask Marcel and Max on 
Bluez List they can help you much more than me.
Sorry for the lack of help
