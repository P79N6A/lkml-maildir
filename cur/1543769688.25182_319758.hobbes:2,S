Well I started out opening /dev/vcs, lseeking to 64, and writing
a string. This "sort of" worked, but screen attributes got messed
up so the "blue" screen attribute 0x17 ended up eventually being
black.
So, I decided to directly write. It doesn't work as you explain
because hardware scroll is being used.

Yes, and I didn't want to. However a customer wants some status to
be always displayed in the upper-right-hand corner of a 4x5 LCD
with a tiny CPU board.
