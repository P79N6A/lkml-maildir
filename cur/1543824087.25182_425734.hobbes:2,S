You misunderstood me:
Due to a broken patch, the driver did
    request_irq(irqnum, handler,...)
twice. Thus the irq handler was registered twice. The rx synchronization 
assumes that the irq handler doesn't run concurrently. I'm not sure what 
happens if the irq handler is registered twice: is it possible that it 
runs twice at the same time, i.e. is the synchronization in the irq 
subsystem irq number or registration call based?

I don't have any good ideas, please try to figure out what's wrong. Is 
there a debug switch for the network layer that forces the network layer 
to verify the CHECKSUM_UNNECESSARY blocks?
