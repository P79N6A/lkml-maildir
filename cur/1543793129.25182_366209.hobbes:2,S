Hi!
As of the kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/README all patches need to be
applied (bigger than the
current local version)
For the current 2.6.14.2 this seems not to be true (The patch 2.6.14.1
seems to be included in
2.6.14.2)
Is this a "new" undocumented general behaviour such as e.g. patches
always based on the
latest 3-Number version or is this a small mistake?
In any case: One of the described sources need to be corrected, I think.
Thanks! Miro
