    Ok, I'll refer to them for raid in the future...

    Good, that makes life easier, and that's what I thought too.  I'll swing
it past the folks at linux-raid in case it's a feaky buffer thing or
something.

    No luck locking it up with some Bonnie testing, and dd if=/dev/zero
of=/dev/sd<whatever> to all drives in the array simultaneously did not lock
up either, nor did Bonnie on the non-raid drive while doing the dd to the 3
in the raid.

    I checked the media on all drives, no errors visible to Adaptec's bios
verify tests, and nothing on the drive's glist.  If I run 'top' while it's
rebuilding, it gets farther before locking, but only 3-8% along vs 2%
without top.  I'll try swapping out the cable and the card.  Got extras of
those on hand.

    Please reply to me directly (and on the list if it's useful to do so) as
I'm not in the mailing list.
    Thanks for your help!
