Hello,
thanks for your answer, I cannot apply your patch, don't know why, but
readind it I think it won't change anything for me: I have db3 (I have a
Mandrake...).
From my compilation:
make[5]: Entering directory
`/usr/src/linux-2.4.2-ac17/drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aicasm'
kgcc -I/usr/include -ldb aicasm_gram.c aicasm_scan.c aicasm.c
aicasm_symbol.c -o aicasm
aicasm/aicasm_gram.y:45: ../queue.h: No such file or directory
aicasm/aicasm_gram.y:50: aicasm.h: No such file or directory
aicasm/aicasm_gram.y:51: aicasm_symbol.h: No such file or directory
aicasm/aicasm_gram.y:52: aicasm_insformat.h: No such file or directory
aicasm/aicasm_scan.l:44: ../queue.h: No such file or directory
aicasm/aicasm_scan.l:49: aicasm.h: No such file or directory
aicasm/aicasm_scan.l:50: aicasm_symbol.h: No such file or directory
aicasm/aicasm_scan.l:51: y.tab.h: No such file or directory
The files exist but aren't seen??? I have tried to change the path to
them, that don't change anything???
I don't understand why...
Thanks you very much,
	Greg
