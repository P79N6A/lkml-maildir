I think a variable rename should be fine, as long as the reader doesn't 
get misled into thinking a specific variable is something which it isn't. 
index sounds fine to me, the nice thing about your patch is that we don't 
have to touch pci_dev->irq at all. The only other change would be what to 
show to userspace e.g. driver prints pci_dev->irq and /proc/interrupts 
prints vector. But that's all secondary...
