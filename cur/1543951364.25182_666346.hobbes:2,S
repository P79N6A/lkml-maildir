Thanks, yes, I agreed with Kame as well.

I slipped in the SLAB_HWCACHE_ALIGN to reduce page cgroup cache contention. Yes
you are right, we do lose out on space due to the extra alignment. My test
results (lmbench) on kmalloc, slub and slab are not very conclusive about
performance. SLUB had the best results w.r.t protection faults and context switches.

I am OK with any version as long as we can get good feedback. I suspect the
feature will be useful for 2.6.25.

That's a very good question. I am not sure about the correct answer to that
myself at the moment.

I'll look at Christoph's patch and see what it addresses to understand the
MOVABLE/RECLAIMABLE discrepancy better.
