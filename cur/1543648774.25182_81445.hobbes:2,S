is this a problem from a security perspective, or a design perspective.
i.e. users should be able to chroot their processes, not to gain
security but just to be able to do things.  Or also for security?

yes, chroot doesn't make a jail, but chroot + other stuff can make a
jail, and chroot can give you the fs side for close to free (lost
performance that is)

b/c root can break out easily, right? to jail root you need other stuff
as I said above.

how? the class way is the fchdir, but I guess there are others, but my
brain is not seeing them right now.

well, this would prevent you from using chroot w/ processes that want to
chroot (running an ftpd inside of a chroot, dont some like to chroot for
anonymous access?), I've thought about that in regards to my research
related to our zap system, and I would rather not have to do that.
