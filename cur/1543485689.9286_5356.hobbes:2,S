Hi, I have experienced two strange errors when upgrading to 2.2.1.
gpm:
# /usr/bin/gpm -t ps2 -m /dev/psaux
And on tty1 the following message appears:
/usr/bin/gpm: socket() Invalid argument
A simular error with sysklogd:
# /usr/sbin/syslogd -m 0 -r
syslogd: cannot create /dev/log: Inavlid argument
Gpm doesn't start at all, and sysklogd starts, but hardly logs anything.
