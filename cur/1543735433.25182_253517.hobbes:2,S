I'm still OOPsing at boot in fib_disable_ip+21 from
fib_netdev_event+63. Both e1000 and tg3 are effected. I have current
linus bk as of time of this message.
It only occurs when Redhat goes through the scaning for new hardware
phase during boot. Is RH loading the drivers in some special way
during this phase? If I load the drivers manually after I'm booted
they load ok. I'm running with the drivers as modules, I'll try
switching to compiled in.
The change referenced in this thread is in my kernel:
fib_semantics.c, 604
                } else {
                        memset(new_info_hash, 0, bytes);
                        memset(new_laddrhash, 0, bytes);
                        fib_hash_move(new_info_hash, new_laddrhash, new_size);
                }
