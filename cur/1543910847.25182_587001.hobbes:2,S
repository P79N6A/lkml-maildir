Besides the sources already mentioned, there are a couple of quite
good books. I know at least Robert Love's Linus Kernel Development, by
O'Reilly, Rubini et. al. Linux Device Drivers,  and Mel Gorman's about
Virtual Memory, whose exact name I can't recall.
You can also try to start following LKML's flow. Maybe you won't
understand much in the beginning, but your comprehension on the
discussions will improve in the future. (Maybe reading a subsystem
mailing list - less traffic - is a good idea, if you have some
specific interests)
