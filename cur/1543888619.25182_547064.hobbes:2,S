Yeah, and where do we disagree here again ? So I take it you're disagreeing
with my agreement with you that lockdep came first ? Geez, think about that
one for a bit. (chuckle) :)
I'd like to remind you that I mapped out the lock hierarchy for a fully
preemptive -rt kernel while you and *others* were wanking around with
voluntary preempt remember ? :) Keep in mind, I'm single obsessed with -rt.

Don't worry about it. I did the same work only to realize that there wasn't
much left to convert over.

I'm anal about these things. I thought that you can do more magic than that
from your previous email, but it just confirms my understanding of how
symbols work already, unless there was a meltdown of the universal physical
laws here or something. That's why I made the choices I did.
The inode initialization code is ambiguous which is why having a specific
line number was very useful. It showed that one of the locks protecting a
tree was heavily hit. There was multipule places in which it could have
been if I hadn't had this information.
Sleep time...
