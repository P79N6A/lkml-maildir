drivers/ide/piix does not support hotplug of any kind. drivers/ide does
not support hotplug of any kind. There is an ioctl hack that vaguely
works now and then for some interfaces but it too is completely unsafe
in 2.6 except for RHEL4. If people keep trying to post suggestions to
use them for anything but debugging I'm going to have to send Andrew
patches to remove them entirely before more people lose their data.
RHEL4 has a set of locking changes/patches to support some basic hotplug
cases, they were refused upstream so upstream simply doesn't support it.
