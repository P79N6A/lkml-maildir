Hi there,
I'm starting to get some module code together, but I've hit a hole in my
understanding of how the header files are ment to be used.
My module supports several different types of interface at different minor
numbers. (e.g. 0 is a memory block, 1 is a fifo, etc...), therefore I've got
different file_operations tables for the different minor devices pointing to
different Open, Release, read and write methods.
Now to structure my code a bit I deciced to have each of the interfaces have
all its file methods in a different C file. Trouble is in each file there is
a Open method which uses INC_MOD_USE_COUNT and a release method which uses
DEC_MOD_USE_COUNT. Now to get these it seems I have to #include module.h,
but if I do that I get linker errors on multiple instances of
__module_kernel_version.
Suggestions please!! (Thank you)
Paul
P.S. Any documentation on the new 2.2 pread and pwrite methods anywhere
(I've read Richard Gooch's API changes page, but I was looking for a little
more info)
P.P.S I'm not suscribed so I'd appreciate a cc to me (Otherwise I'll have to
trawl the archives for responses)
