Subject: total freeze with framebuffer + X

Not sure whether this is a kernel or X bug, but here goes:
I have framebuffer support enabled (atyfb) with an ATI Mach64 card
(Xpert98). If I run X twice, i.e. start X, then run another server from
within an xterm, the machine freezes. This does not happen if framebuffer
is disabled. I've seen this since 2.2.1 (when I first compiled framebuffer
in).
Has anybody else seen this? Any ideas what might be wrong?
