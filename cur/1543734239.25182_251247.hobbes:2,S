And making it compile with the hash code, rather than the rb_tree one? I know 
ghash.h must be removed, but there is no reason at all to switch to Red-Black 
trees. Even because, later, we will just see "Hey, I get a panic here" + 
backtrace. Doing things right in first place is better.
Andrew, what's your opinion about this? Do you prefer staying with the same 
code (but without having a ghash.h) or using the new one?
My idea is to move the needed #defines (not everything) inside physmem.c for 
now, so that ghash.h does not appear in 2.6.9; then, after fixing the 
breakage for mainline, we can look at the code to see if it needs any change; 
however that should be tested for a while (probably in Jeff Dike's tree, 
which is going to become for experimental stuff, now that UML gets merged in 
mainline).
Bye
