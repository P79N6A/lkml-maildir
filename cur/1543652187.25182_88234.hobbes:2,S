Yes, this would be a positive step and has been proposed by
others on the linux-scsi list. It may be a bit late for the
2.4 series but the time would be right for the 2.5 series.
James Bottomley <James.Bottomley@steeleye.com> and Doug Ledford
<dledford@redhat.com> are maintaining BK repositories for the
scsi subsystem in the 2.5 series. If you could submit your
patches to them, then they will find their way to Linus
in an orderly fashion.
