I thought about this. But, chose the other one just to save one additional
'and' overhead.

I agree the above suggestion is clean. But, it will have one additional 'and'
operation when we set NULL. I saw some concern from Andrew earlier on overhead
this patch was adding.

AFAIK, kmalloc_node should return an even address always. I was just being
paranoid and wanted to assert it here as otherwise some normal timer may end up
being deferred timer.
