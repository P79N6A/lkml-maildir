    The droid was Dave Cutler, who could easily have thrown away
    the powerpoint slides and done a very respectable technical
    presentation.  If he had flashed one stupid slide, dumped the
    rest, and drawn replacements on the fly the audience would
    have given him a standing-O. But talking about market share
    as an OS theory conference - the horror, the horror.
    On the Subject, Plan-9 is not a commercial dead horse:
