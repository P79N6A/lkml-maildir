Hi Folks,
How can I change the Number of processes that can be run on the 2.4 kernel ?
Is there a way to change that ? I would be glad if someone can direct me in this regards. In kernel 2.2.x, we could modify tasks.h to accompliish the task. How do we
go about doing it in the 2.4 kernel ?
Sorry if this question has been answered before, I could not find it in the archives.
Thanks in Advance
Regards
           Carter
