No, I didn't. I agree with you that they should be separate and
distinct. I'm just pointing out that you're overstretching your argument
a little. There are some similiarities in that in both cases we want to
get the driver into some quiet state and out of it again. The difference
comes from the fact that the quite states don't have to be the same and
shouldn't be the same. I won't insult your intelligence by describing
the differences in more detail.

Absolutely. It's about getting the data we need to restore it to the
same state post-hibernation-cycle (or, more correctly)
post-atomic-restore.

That's where I think you're overstretching the argument. Like suspend
(to ram), we're concerned at the snapshot point with getting the
hardware in the same state at a later stage. Unlike suspend, we don't
necessarily want it to enter a low power-usage state as part of that
state preservation.
