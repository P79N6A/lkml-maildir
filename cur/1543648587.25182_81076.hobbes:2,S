Yes, I hit this problem a month or two ago with Lustre - the 90TB
filesystem we are testing on wrapped and I thought it was a problem
in our code until I did some more digging.  However, lying about
the blocksize isn't a big loss, since we prefer 64kB vector page I/O
over the network anyways for performance reasons, even though the
backing stores actually use 4kB blocksize.
Cheers, Andreas
