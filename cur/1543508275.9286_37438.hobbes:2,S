Greetings.
I've been working on a filesystem driver for old CBM1541 disks (and images),
mainly because I have a collection of some 3000+ disks.
Tthe filesystem on these disks is structured into 683 blocks of 256 bytes
each. The 'superblock' is on block 358.
In my first attempt, part of the code in read_super() looked like this:
	set_blocksize(s->s_dev, 256);
	bh = bread(s->s_dev, 258, 256);
After testing and enjoying the panic that ensued, I did some hunting and
discovered in fs/buffer.c that the block size must >= 512 bytes.
Why is this? I admit I'm unfamiliar with most of the filesystem code, but
it seems a little silly to limit the block size in this (seemingly
arbitrary) way.
Am I doing this wrong? Is there another way to acheive what I want?
Regards,
Rob.
