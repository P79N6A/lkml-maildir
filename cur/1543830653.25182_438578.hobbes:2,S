No. Sorry. My English is bad. I mean changing CPU frequency.

Again :-)

I'm trying not to break DMA. Current version of longhaul (marked broken 
in 2.6.16.2) simply clears bus master bit on every device.

Yes. And CPU temperature is lower.

This is worst for SATA. USB (this is strange) seems to work correcly.
I know that this is 10% coverage, but it is better then nothing.
It is always possible to add support for longhaul to driver.

This was my first idea. But trust me in current kernel this is simply
worst idea.

I added this to longhaul, but it only works on non EBGA CPU's.
EBGA CPU's (at least Nehemiah) seem to have voltage scaling
disabled.

"Once this is set, the processor will switch to the
value in [26:23] on the next AUTOHALT transition. The duration of the AUTOHALT
should be >=1ms to ensure the CPU's internal PLL is resynchronized. For 
AUTOHALT, this means interrupts must be disabled except for the time tick, 
which should be reset to >=1ms. Care must be taken to avoid other system events 
that could interfere with this operation. A few examples are snooping, NMI, 
INIT, SMI and FLUSH."
For CPU's with Longhaul MSR this time is equal to 200us.
