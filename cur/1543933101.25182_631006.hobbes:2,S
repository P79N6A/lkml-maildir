Right it's a PIX blade in Cisco chassis.  The PIX is running ASA version 7.0(6)

I definitely see SACKs over the course of the 38 hours.  I don't have
any Windows hosts, they are all running Linux except for a very small
number that run a proprietary OS and webserver.  If the firewall were
to get trashed and hose the currently active connections, I would
expect that newly initiated connections would work.

I've pinged our dude that handles the PIX stuff to see about getting
an upgrade to 7.0(7).  I should be able to get a packet trace, but it
may take some time.  At this point I'm getting a lot of resistance and
people here telling me to just turn SACK off and not worry about what
is causing this issue, but I'd really like to get to the bottom of it.
