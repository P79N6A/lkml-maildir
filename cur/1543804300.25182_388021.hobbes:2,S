Subject: [RFC: 2.6 patch] move ip2.c and ip2main.c to drivers/char/ip2/
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi Michael,
I plan to do some cleanups for the ip2 driver including replacing the 
#include'ing of .c files with building them separately and linking them 
together.
As a preparation, this patch contains the following:
- move ip2.c and ip2main.c to drivers/char/ip2/
- rename ip2.c to ip2base.c (the module is still called ip2)
- adjust some #include's in the moved file to the new location
Is this patch OK for you?
Due to it's size (due to moving the files around) the patch is attached 
gzip'ed.
diffstat output:
 drivers/char/Makefile      |    2 
 drivers/char/ip2.c         |  109 -
 drivers/char/ip2/Makefile  |    8 
 drivers/char/ip2/ip2base.c |  109 +
 drivers/char/ip2/ip2main.c | 3260 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 drivers/char/ip2main.c     | 3260 -------------------------------------
