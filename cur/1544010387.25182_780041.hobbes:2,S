For such large copies it is better to use multiple smaller (e.g. 4K) 
copy user, that gives better real time preempt latencies. Each cfu has a 
cond_resched(), but only one, not multiple times in the inner loop.

It depends how performance critical it is.
One way for example is to grab the user pages using get_user_pages()
and then reference those pages directly using kmap().
But you would be at the mercy of the user process not modifying in 
parallel then. Normally it is safer to work from copies in kernel
space to avoid races. As long as it doesn't happen too often a few
copies are also usually not a problem. I wouldn't worry about them
unless you see them prominently in profiler logs.
