Yes.  In fact, that's the default situation and it requires some work to
get two logins of the same user into the same PAG.
AFS currently handles PAGs by creating "random" high-numbered groups and
putting the user into them, and then associating the token with that group
in the kernel.
One could debate whether it's best to put a user into the same PAG as
their other logins by default, but it's imperative that a user be able to
create a separate PAG when they wish to (so, for example, they can acquire
separate credentials in that new PAG without affecting the credentials and
PAG for their other running processes).
