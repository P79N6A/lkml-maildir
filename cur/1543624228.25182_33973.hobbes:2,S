Hi Wolly,
ACPI development is happening out of the mainline for now, until it
stabilizes. Please try the latest patches available at
http://sf.net/projects/acpi
 . AFAIK the button thing is fixed in the latest
ACPI patch, although the sysrq hookup feature is new, so that is definitely
useful code, thanks.
Regards -- Andy
