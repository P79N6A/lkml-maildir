These I have tested on the kernel 2.6.12-rc4-mm1 with the following test
suites , with kdump enabled 
Once test suites PASS/SUCCESS, force the machine to hang(lock up) by 
disabling irqs with the attached SPINLOCK test module from Badari 
Pulavarthy, 
try to take dump either with sysrq key or nmi_watchdog=2 kernel parameter.
Test Suite: 
-----------
LTP Runall, FSracer(race condition in file system) with LVM partitions 
(over ext2, ext3, JFS, XFS), FS stress, Mem Test/Bash Memory, Cerberus, 
KernBench, NetPerf.
System Info:
------------
Distro: SLES 9 SP1
Software/kernel variables:
--------------------------
1. kernel - linux-2.6.12-rc4-mm1 
2. kexec-tools-1.101 + kdump patches
3. kernel.sysrq=1
 
Command line parameters for first kernel:
-----------------------------------------
  root = <> vga=0x31a selinux=0 splash=silent resume=<> elevator=cfq 
showpts
  crashkernel=48M@16M console=tty0 console=ttyS0,38400n1
 
Hardwares on which is test cases are run:
-----------------------------------------
A) 1way, Pentium IV 2.8GHz, 2G RAM
   - Network Interface (e1000)
   - Disk I/O: SCSI storage controller: Adaptec Ultra320
   o Ran test suite KERNBENCH and CERBERUS test ran successfully. Forced 
     system hang by inserting spinlock test module and tried to invoke 
     panic with sysrq+c, but it failed to force Panic. I failed to take 
the 
     dump as sysrq keys failed to respond during hang.
   o Booted with nmi_watchdog=2 and ran similar tests and then forced 
system 
     hang by inserting spinlock module, nmi_watchdog caused kernel panic 
and 
     the system booted to panic kernel. I was able to take dump. The first 
     kernel was rebuilt after applying Vivek's following patch to fix 
kexec 
     on panic with nmi watchdog enabled
                 
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=111631994607762&w=2
B) SMP, 2way, Pentium III (Coppermine) 1 GHz, 1.3G RAM
   - Network Interface (e100)
   - Disk I/O: SCSI storage controller: Adaptec Ultra160
   o Ran test suite MemTest and Bash Memory, after running the test for 
some
     time (< 1hr.), forced system hang by inserting spinlock test module 
     and tried to invoke kernel panic with sysrq-c, but it failed to force 
     panic and hence couldn't initiate kdump. 
   o Booted with nmi_watchdog=2 and ran similar tests and then forced 
system 
     hang by inserting spinlock module, nmi_watchdog caused kernel panic 
and 
     the system booted to panic kernel. I was able to take dump. The first 
     kernel was rebuilt after applying Vivek's following patch to fix 
kexec 
     on panic with nmi watchdog enabled
                 
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=111631994607762&w=2
 
   o Ran the same test suite, after running the test for more than 10hours 
     kernel OOps have occured (bugme 4653) but kdump failed to boot to 
     secondary kernel as there was no kernel panic and just an kernel 
oops.
     Now I have set kernel sysctl parameter kernel.panic_on_oops=1, 
testing in 
     progress to capture the oops in kdump 
 
   o While testing the functionality of kdump, encountered this driver 
hardening
     issue (bugme:4631) also.
C) SMP, 2way, Xeon TM 2.8GHz, 1.5G RAM
   - Network Interface (Tigon3)
   - Disk I/O: SCSI storage controller: IBM Serve RAID
 
   o Ran test suite FSracer over LVM partition and the test ran without 
     failures. Forced system hang by inserting spinlock test module and 
then 
     invoked kernel panic with sysrq-c. Secondary kernel booted properly 
     without any issues. I was able to take the dump using sysrq keys.
