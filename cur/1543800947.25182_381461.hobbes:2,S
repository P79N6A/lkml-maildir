Keith,
I noticed that during page faults, the OOPS handler is not getting
called when the kernel crashes in
filp_open() -- the notifier chain does not return for some reason.  I
also noticed that when this happens, if you the section in 
/arch/i386/kernel/traps.c in function die() prior to the busting of
spinlocks, it will work (sortof work).  To reproduce this error, call 
filp_open with a text string complied in the kernel.  I can reproduce on 
2.6.10 and 2.6.11 Fedora Kernels.   Also noticed that when Kprobes is 
enabled, the debugger page faults during a page fault exeception. 
Seems related to the notifier chain.
If you fixed this already, disregard this notice.
Jeff
