According to Alan Cox:

I'm afraid that's not quite true, Alan.  C++ was is a complete
language, even when it could be translated easily into C.  Would you
assert that C is just a preprocessor since it can be translated easily
into assembler?  Of course not.
Besides, ANSI C++ contains some constructs that are quite difficult to
express in C, particularly the exception model.
That said, I entirely agree that it's not necessary to use C++ instead
of C to write good code.  On the other hand, I suggest that C++ would
have been a good choice for the Linux kernel __IF__ a compiler of the
quality of today's EGCS had been available back then.  But it wasn't.
