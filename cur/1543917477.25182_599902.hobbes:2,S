I have not run across the whole kernel to find out, his estimation is
likely high as his sample (mm/sched.c) includes a particular construct
(multiple assignment) which is reported and overly common in that
piece of code.  If I take mm/signal.c (also big) I get 1/1000 files,
and those two are easily fixed.  I should note it shows some 62 actual
real violations in that file.
I do receive automated checks of every patch posted to lkml and I work
to remove the false positives from them.  The false positive ratio is
very low in those reports and it those which drive my development effort.
checkpatch is a work in progress and likely will be for many years to
come.
I have propose we 'gate' those subjective tests, and have asked for
input on that thread on the default for those tests.
