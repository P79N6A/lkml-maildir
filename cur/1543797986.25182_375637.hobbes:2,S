Sounds like it needs someone with an ATA bus analyser, or of course
someone from IBM to be helpful

And the BIOS and driver hackers for IBM wrote both bits and had all the
source and made them aware of each other. We don't have that luxury.

What else does that code do, what else might it confuse, what rules and
locking are hidden in the windows driver that are unknown. Want to risk
everyones data for that ?
HDAPS doesn't need it btw.

Yes but that isn't neccessarily the right thing to do. You want the
abstraction for the resource ownership and expansion. Can you summarize
the two drivers interaction with the ports ?

One large scale example is the i2c bus code which has to deal with
multiple devices on multiple busses all being used by multiple people at
the same time.
Another is I2O where the I2O core code owns the I2O controller and the
detail for it and is used by various device drivers on top. That one is
fairly high level however and not exactly minimal.
It may well be that in your case the 'core' module can only identify the
ports, claim them, release them on unload and provide 'lock' and
'unlock' functions and the base address.
