   Here's My Rant (tm). Not directed at HE or AJG.
   The question of support for ISA accelerated SVGA cards is a FAQ, or ought to
   be. IMHO it is shameful that the answer is "You can't do that."
   The form of that answer is usually "Buy a new video card." I grit my teeth
   at that and think "Don't change the subject." Problem hardware is not the
   same thing as a hardware problem.
Tom,
	The other standard answer to this question is --- "You have the
source code; make it work and send us a patch."
	Linux is an Open Source project, staffed mostly by volunteers.
The good news is this means that if you feel very strongly about the
lack of a feature, you have the freedom to go and add that feature
enough.  If it's not worth enough of your time to do that, then it
obviously wasn't worth a lot of your time.  If everyone collectively
decides it's not worth their time to do it, then perhaps it wasn't worth
doing after all.
