Subject: [PATCH] fix page->count discrepancy for zero page
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

While writing some analysis tools for memory hot-remove, we came across
a single page which had a ->count that always increased, without bound. 
It ended up always being the zero page, and it was caused by a leaked
reference in some do_wp_page() code that ends up avoiding PG_reserved
pages.
Basically what happens is that page_cache_release()/put_page() ignore
PG_reserved pages, while page_cache_get()/get_page() go ahead and take
the reference.  So, each time there's a COW fault on the zero-page, you
get a leaked page->count increment.
It's pretty rare to have a COW fault on anything that's PG_reserved, in
fact, I can't think of anything else that this applies to other than the
zero page.
In any case, it the bug doesn't cause any real problems, but it is a bit
of an annoyance and is obviously incorrect.  We've been running with
this patch for about 3 months now, and haven't run into any problems
with it.
Attached patch is against 2.6.7 and applies to -mm3 properly.
