What you really want is a copy-on-write tree, or a simpe cp.  Or are you
that short on space that you need compression?
Speaking of which, I know copy-on-write files are planned.  What about
whole trees?
But, short of that, you can always do a poor man's copy-on-write with
"cp -al" or "cp -as", assuming you remember to copy when you write...

I just keep a -mm patch around and the original vanilla tarball, but to
each his own.

I back up with rsync, actually.
Speaking of backup, that's another nice place for a plugin.  Imagine a
dump that didn't have to be of the entire FS, but rather an arbitrary
tree...  That might be a nice new archive format.  I know Apple already
uses something like this for their dmg packages.
