If that's the rule, then with exactly the same algorithmic efficiency,
readdir+dnotify can be used to maintain the cache in userspace
instead.  There is nothing gained by using the helper module in that case.
It follows that a helper module is only useful if readdir+dnotify
isn't fast enough, and the invalidation rule has to be more selective.
(Although, maybe there are atomicity concerns I haven't thought of).
