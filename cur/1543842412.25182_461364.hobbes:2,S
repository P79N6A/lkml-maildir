OK.

But that'll leave us reading possibly-freed memory.
I expect the correct way to fix this is with locking: the /proc/partitions
reading code needs to lock down the partition information while it's
reading it.
AFAICT the appropriate lock to take is the bdev->bd_mutex on the blockdev
which represents the "whole" disk.  But I'm not sure whether that's
correct, nor what the official way is of hunting down that block_device*,
nor whether the code in do_open() is managing to take the correct lock.
Cc's hopefully added.
