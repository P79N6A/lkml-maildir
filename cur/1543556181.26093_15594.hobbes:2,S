Hi,
How well is the ATA100/UDMA100 supported in the development kernels ? I
have a system with an ASUS CUSL2 mobo, which has built-in ATA100 IDE
channels, alongwith a Maxtor 20Gb ATA100 HD.
I looked at the kernel config for 2.4.0-test11, but in the "IDE, ATA and
ATAPI Block devices" section couldn't find chipset-specific support for
either the:
(1) Intel i815 chipset, which is what the ASUS-CUSL2 has
or the
(2) Intel I/O Controller Hub 2 (ICH2)
I'd like to get my system working using the built-in ATA100 controller
on the ASUS CUSL2, but what options do I need in 2.4.0-test11's kernel
config ?
Is there support for the Intel i815 chipset ?
I'd appreciate any info.
Thanks,
