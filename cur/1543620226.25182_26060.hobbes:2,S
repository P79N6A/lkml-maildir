In principle, sendto() will always succeed unless you provided the
wrong parameters in the function call, or the machines crashes, at
which time your task won't be there to receive the error code anyway.
Hackers code sendto as:
	sendto(s,...);
Professional programmers use:
	(void)sendto(s,...);
checking the return value is useless.
Note that the man-page specifically states that ENOBUFS can't happen.
You cannot assume that any sendto() data actually gets on the wire, much
less to its destination. With any user-datagram-protocol, both ends,
sender and receiver, have to work out what they will do with missing
packets and packets received out-of-order.

    I was going to compile a list of innovations that could be
    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
