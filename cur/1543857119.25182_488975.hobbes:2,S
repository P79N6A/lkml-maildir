How do you to the atomic bitops?
Also, I don't see quite why you think "cmpxchg()" and "atomic_cmpxchg()" 
would be different. ANY cmpxchg() needs to be atomic - if it's not, 
there's no point to the operation at all, since you'd just write it as
	if (*p == x)
		*p = y;
instead, and not use cmpxchg(). 
So yes, architectures without native support (where "native" includes 
load-locked + store-conditional) always need to
 - on UP, just disable interrupts
 - on SMP, use a spinlock (with interrupts disabled), and share that 
   spinlock with all the other atomic ops (bitops at a minimum - the 
   "atomic_t" operations have traditionally been in another "locking 
   space" because of sparc32 historic braindamage, but I'd suggest 
   sharing the same spinlock between them all).
And yeah, it sucks. You _can_ (if you really want to) make the spinlock be 
hashed based on the address of the atomic data structure. That at least 
allows you to do _multiple_ spinlocks, but let's face it, your real 
problem is _likely_ going to be cacheline bouncing, not contention, and 
then using a hashed lock won't be likely to buy you all that much.
