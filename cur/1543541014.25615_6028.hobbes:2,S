You've probably allready been told this, but...
When you do a make menuconfig, etc.. there is a choice at the
bottom of the opening screen to "SAVE configuration" and "LOAD
configuration".  After configuring your kernel, choose "SAVE" and
then enter a filename like "/boot/config-2.2.16-1" or whatever
you'll remember it as.  Next time you run menuconfig, just pick
"load config" and then give it the filename.  It's been like this
since 2.0.0.
Also, if you have an installed kernel source tree that you've
compiled and you want to recompile it for some reason you can
use:
make oldconfig
So any of your custom settings can allready be saved by the
kernel config process.
