Hello,
I tried some tests with the newest kernel (2.2.1-ac3). I run
iozone over NFS (the NFS serveur is a Solaris 2.5.1 with a
patch for the async writing : set nfssrv:rfs_write_async=0 in
the /etc/system file) to bench the new performance.
Here is what I get :
/soleil/u7/danis/tmp > ../iozone/iozone-2.2.1-ac3 100 8192 zz
        IOZONE: Performance Test of Sequential File I/O  --  V2.01 (10/21/94)
                By Bill Norcott
        Operating System: POSIX 1003.1-1990

        IOZONE writes a 100 Megabyte sequential file consisting of
        12800 records which are each 8192 bytes in length.
        It then reads the file.  It prints the bytes-per-second
        rate at which the computer can read and write files.
Writing the 100 Megabyte file, 'zz'...Error writing block 2198
If I rerun the test, I get the same error on a different block.
No log in /var/log/messages.
It worked nicely with 2.2.0-ac1.
Thanks,
