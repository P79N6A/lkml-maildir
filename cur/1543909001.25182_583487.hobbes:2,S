Does the acronym GAFL ring any bells?  It's not that idea is worthless -
it sure as hell is a useful thing, but what the bleeding hell is that
splitup supposed to achieve?
Please, people, try to think for a minute.  Patch series are good not
just because; there are rational reasons for that.  None of those
applies here; if anything, you've made sure that this patchbomb will
be less reviewed.
Seriously, get a fucking life.  This is way past ridiculous.  It does not
make changes easier to test.  It does not help bisect.  It does not help
to make changes more self-contained.  It does not reduce the odds of
conflict with pending patches.  It does not simplify conflict resolution
when porting.  It does not split the change into easier understood parts.
Hell, it doesn't even make it easier to revert broken parts.
Use the common sense, folks.  Please.
