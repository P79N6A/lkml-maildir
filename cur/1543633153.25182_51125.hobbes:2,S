So, I will not attempt to convince you that you need per-socket
counters.  I do know for absolute certain that I would like to
have them (I write a traffic-generation & testing program).
For instance, when I run 50Mbps bi-directional on a P-4 1.6Ghz machine,
using a single port of a DFE-570tx NIC, then I drop around .2% of
the packets, in bursts.  I have kernel buffers very large (2MB),
and the CPU is not maxed out.
With the current system, it is difficult for me to know exactly what
I need to change to get better performance and/or if better performance
is even possible.

If you're talking per-socket SNMP counters, then that could work.
General protocol-wide counters would not help much, at least
in my case.
Thanks,
Ben
