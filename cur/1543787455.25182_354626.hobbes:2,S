That's all the numa goop which Martin Hicks added.  It's all disabled if
z->reclaim_pages is zero (it is).  However we could be testing that flag a
bit earlier, I think.
And yeah, some de-spaghettification would be nice.  Certainly before adding
more logic.
Martin, should we take out the early zone reclaim logic?  It's all
unreachable at present anyway.
