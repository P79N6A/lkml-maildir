Good points.
Getting cpusets to work in a hierarchical organization managing a large
system is a key goal of mine.
That means shaping the API's so that they fit the structure of various
users, so that the right person or program can make the right decision
at the right time, easily, and have it all work.
Take a look at my "no need to load balance" flag idea, in my post
a few minutes ago responding to Nick.  That feels to me like it
might be an API that fits the users space, understanding and needs
well, while still giving us what we need to be able to reduce the
size of sched domain partitions on huge systems, where possible.
