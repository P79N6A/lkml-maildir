It seems that the Alpha port still calls schedule() during tlb flush
operations. Could you please remove the pointer_lock() from
smp_call_function()? Just replace it with a simple spin_lock() or
spin_lock_bh().
Many functions such as try_to_swap_out() call flush_tlb_xy() while they
own a spinlock (eg. mm->page_table_lock).
