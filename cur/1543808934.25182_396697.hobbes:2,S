Btw, on a totally unrelated tangent, I just wanted to say how much I 
appreciate people looking for regressions like this, and trying to track 
them. Andrew does it, but this is absolutely something that should be 
possible to get more people to do, and it would be a huge boon for kernel 
development if we had a more aggressive regression tracking system.
Right now it all very easily gets lost in the noise - either on the 
mailing list or even on bugzilla (where following up on regressions and 
trying to get details and prodding people to perhaps try to narrow things 
down a bit more often ends up falling on the floor, because it's a big 
job).
