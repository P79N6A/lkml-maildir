While I really like the idea with this patch, I'm 100% certain that
Linus would not, under any circumstances, accept this patch.
I suggest that we instead force everyone to program with:
syntax on
let c_space_errors=1
(Or equivalent Emacs/[insert favourite editor here]-setting instead)
While at it, force people to read linux/Documentation/CodingStyle
and make them adhere to it.
Of course, I guess this is a free world (yeah, right) and everyone
should have the right to code in their own way, but I'd wish that people
at least could be consistent when indenting/spacing/bracing/whatever,
and when patching other people's code, also follow the already set
standard of that file instead of introducing a new one...
