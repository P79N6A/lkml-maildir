Subject: [PATCH 2/6] vmtrunc: restore unmap_vmas zap_bytes
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/10/3/73

The low-latency unmap_vmas patch silently moved the zap_bytes test
after the TLB finish and lockbreak and regather: why?  That not only
makes zap_bytes redundant (might as well use ZAP_BLOCK_SIZE), it makes
the unmap_vmas level redundant too - it's all about saving TLB flushes
when unmapping a series of small vmas.
Move zap_bytes test back before the lockbreak, and delete the curious
comment that a small zap block size doesn't matter: it's true need_flush
prevents TLB flush when no page has been unmapped, but unmapping pages
in small blocks involves many more TLB flushes than in large blocks.
