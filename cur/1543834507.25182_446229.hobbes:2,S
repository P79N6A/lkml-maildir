Oh.  But Neil almost told me that :)  That seems to fix a similar
problem for me at least:
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/426931
Now I'm not seeing any weirdness between two 2.6.18-rc2 hosts.  (No
spurious "Reducing readahead size to 28/4/0K" either).  I still don't
get how that patch that Neil mentioned did not affect 2.6.17 (which had
that), but does effect any 2.6.18-rcX.
