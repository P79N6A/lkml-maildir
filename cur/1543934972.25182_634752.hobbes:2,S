As for example in the case when it dies in ieee1394-thread the list is
so corrupted that it will die anyway.
But I might try this anyway, as I don't really have a better idee.

I did not add U, because I thought that would only needed to trace memory leaks.
And I hoped that using P (poison) would catch any later use (after free).

I think this bug is highly timing dependent. Its not always the same
package that dies and as this is a SMP system I would guess two CPUs
using the same data will trigger this.
And using the poison-option will definitily slow the system down and
mess up the timings.
What also speaks against the 'safer' offsets is, that after adding my
notfreed-byte to skbuff the bug still triggered in the same way.
I'm currently looking at
http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-scsi@vger.kernel.org/msg12702.html
,trying to understand if this is relevant for me on x86_64.
