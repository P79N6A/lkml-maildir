However, I just tried the same driver on my desktop PC (4xSATA HDs, 1xPATA) 
and I get the following periodically (when the PATA device is NOT being 
used):
ata1: irq trap
ata1: command 0x25 timeout, stat 0x50 host_stat 0x20
ata2: irq trap
ata2: command 0xca timeout, stat 0x50 host_stat 0x20
ata4: irq trap
ata4: irq trap
ata4: irq trap
ata4: irq trap
ata4: command 0xc8 timeout, stat 0x50 host_stat 0x20
ata1-4 are the HDs, ata5 is the PATA device (it does not trigger).
This could however be some bug in 2.6.16-rc6, the last kernel on this box with 
2.6.16-rc4 without your IDE patches.
Any ideas?
