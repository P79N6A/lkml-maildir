SHM_LOCK locks pages in memory, but vmscan.c ignores that:
* it scans the associated vma.
* the pages are removed from the page tables, ie there will be a "soft
pagefault" during the next access of this page.
* swap_out() needs the kernel lock, ie it's very important that we avoid
unnecessary operations.
What about setting VM_LOCKED in shmctl(SHM_LOCK)?
[perhaps a new flags will be required, because mlock()/munlock() should
not be able to clear this flag]
