Please sequence-number patches even if they are unrelated.  That will make
emails like this one easier.
1: CRIS v10: Correct do_signal to fix oops and clean up signal handling in general.
2: CRIS: Define __ARCH_WANT_SYS_RT_SIGSUSPEND in unistd.h for CRIS
3: CRIS v10: kernel/time.c needs to include linux/vmstat.h to compile.
4: CRIS v10: Driver for ds1302 needs to include cris-specific i2c.h
Patches 3 and 4 were missing your signed-off-by:.  I added it.
I queued patches 1, 3 and 4 for 2.6.24 and patch 2 for 2.6.25.  Do you agree?
