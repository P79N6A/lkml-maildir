Validation means checking against something. If this something resides in
the same file, it can be doctored if the file can be somehow modified. And
you explained how above.

The above way just won't work, and no similar strategy will.
The whole idea of capabilities in the file itself is broken: It smears out
the privileges over the filesystem and the file itself, and works only for
some types of files (how about a webserver written in Perl?). It looks very
fragile and complex to me. And all to be able to continue using current
tools that know nothing whatsoever about special privileges, and so are
sure to get it wrong.
Again: Where do we want to go? And then, How do we get there? Broken
systems (where old and new kernels run concurrently) will last a very short
time, or none at all. So this is not a serious problem. Ssytems that import
filesystems from elsewhere (via NFS, CD-ROM, diskette, ...) will be around
for a long time. That is where compatibility and checks are warranted. And
the simplest way to get this right is for the affected filesystem writers
to be aware of capabilities, or just not handle them at all.  Same goes for
file managing tools.
How do other systems do this? It was said that VMS essentially holds the
privileged files open all the time and modification of them is not
allowed. This could be fine, as long as there are few such files. But I
suspect this will not be true for long...

Not really needed: If I want a secure system, I won't get into that
scenario; or my previous system was secured, and subverting it for the new
setup is very hard. And it won't last anyway.
