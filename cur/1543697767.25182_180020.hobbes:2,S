been looking and googling for hours... and haven't found a definitive
answer.
Anyone know if, and how well, the following is supported?
================
Asus A7V600
http://www.asus.com/prog/spec.asp?m=A7V600&langs=01
	- ADI AD1980 audio sound
	- eCom 3C940 gigabit ethernet
		does it have a driver?
		does it work on 10/100 too?
================
Soyo sy-kt600 Dragon+ v1.0
http://www.soyousa.com/products/proddesc.php?id=280
	- VIA 1616 audio sound
	- VIA VT6307 IEEE1394 - firewire
	- chip?  10/100 ethernet
================
Soyo sy-kt600 Dragon Ultra Platinum
	- CMI 8738 - audio sound
		- kernel 2.4.x and 2.6 has support
	- VT6306 Firewire 1394
	- BCM5705K gigabit ethernet
		does it have a driver?
		does it work on 10/100 too?
	- Silicon Image SIL3112 - SATA
	- 8237 SATA/IDE
	* yes it has both SATA chips and support 4 SATA
================
Gigabyte GA-7V600 1394

	- VIA VT6306 IEEE1394 - firewire
	- RTL8101L - Ethernet network
	- IO - IT8705

*** what is the ordering of the sound chips, above, from best worst?
	ADI AD1980
	CMI 8738
	VIA 1616
	RT ALC655
*** notice the slightly different firewire chips
	6307 vs 6306
