The card BIOS says it's a DAC960P - that's all the info I've got.

That's all the info it prints, then it hangs.  It seems to be that 
something's happening when it tries to detect the controller.

DAC960 version and copyright info, since it completely hangs.  I'm 
booting from a distro (Gentoo) installation CD, so no syslog facility is 
in place.
