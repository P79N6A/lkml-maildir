Only if you read it with $sysfs{modalias}, it's available in $env{MODALIAS}
and does not get mangled there, right? If you have problems with that,
let us know and we will fix it.
(We can't trust the values of some sysfs files to be passed to external
programs or directly used to create a device node name, cause some of
them are directly copied from a device property.)
Thanks,
