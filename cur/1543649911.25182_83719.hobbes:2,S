I have to say that I think this patch is ugly, and a complete duplicate
of existing code. This is always bad, especially in the case of
something not really straight forward (like blk_rq_map_sg()). A hack.
I can understand the need for something like this, for drivers that
can't use a struct scatterlist directly. I'd rather do this in a
different way, though.
__blk_rq_map(q, rq, sglist, callback)
{
	...
	/* do the mapping *.
	if (sglist) {
		sglist[nsegs].page = bvec->bv_page;
		...
	} else
		callback(q, bvec, nsegs);
}
blk_rq_map_rq(q, rq, sglist)
{
	return __blk_rq_map(q, rq, sglist, NULL);
}
blk_rq_map_callback(q, rq, callback)
{
	return __blk_rq_map(q, rq, NULL, callback);
}
Or use a cookie like you currently do.
Oh, and do try to follow the style. It's
	if (cond)
		foo();
not
	if (fond) foo();
