I can categorise some of them:
1.	Hardware that just doesnt support it.
2.	Timeouts that are false positives caused by disks having problems
	and being very slow to recover
3.	Bad cabling
4.	Stalls caused by heavy PCI traffic
> is there a reason to believe that it'll work better "later"?
#1 will go fail, fail, fail -> PIO now (or should do Im about to try it)
#2 and #4 will be transient
#3 could go either way
