Glad to see that I'm not completely insane :).

Yeah, I don't really see how ld.so would know about the kernel mcount.
AFAIK it only knows about symbols exported from ELF libraries that it
has loaded in user space. 
I'm still trying to figure out if LATENCY_TRACE could effect
do_execve(), since that's the routine that starts the init program. I'm
wondering if do_execve() is doing something that aggrevates ld.so, so
that it loads the program and/or libraries incorrectly.
Guess that's what I'll be doing Monday morning...
