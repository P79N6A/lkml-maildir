Well, at this point, it only really concerns nvidia and ati's and their
respective firmwares seem to expose some properties a bit differently...
The radeon code would probably work for nvidia though as I'm not trying
to get the connector type for nvidiafb yet, but if I ever try, it seems
the stuff is a bit different.
I'd say let's keep them separate for now, I may put them in a common
place some day ..

Ok, if you confirm it doesn't seem to do any regression on other
hardware (I don't have any other nvidia hw to test with), I'd like it
upstream asap (probably too late for 2.6.14 though).
