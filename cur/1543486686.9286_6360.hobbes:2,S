Subject: System hanging with 2.2.1, 2.2.1-ac*, 2.2.2.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/1999/2/21/1

All of these boot fine, start X-windows, and allow 1 unproblematic login,
then if I log in on another screen it takes several minutes each time.
The same behavior occurs if I try "ssh -l <someone> localhost".
Moreover there are some network oddities. I can't ping myself:
 ~$ ping localhost
 PING localhost (127.0.0.1): 56 data bytes
 --- localhost ping statistics ---
 6 packets transmitted, 0 packets received, 100% packet loss
If I ping somewhere else many packets are lost:
 ~$ ping math.berkeley.edu
 PING math.berkeley.edu (128.32.183.94): 56 data bytes
 64 bytes from 128.32.183.94: icmp_seq=0 ttl=236 time=203.7 ms
 
 --- math.berkeley.edu ping statistics ---
 29 packets transmitted, 1 packets received, 96% packet loss
 round-trip min/avg/max = 203.7/203.7/203.7 ms
http connections to my own machine fail entirely, and any connection to a
foreign machine is ridiculously slow, probably for the same reason, ping
is failing ? Nothing is being logged which indicates a problem, so I can't
say much more except that the system is just unusable. 
My System:
=> Kernel Version:
Linux genera 2.2.2 #2 Sat Feb 20 10:38:47 PST 1999 i486 unknown
=> EGCS Version:
Reading specs from /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i486-pc-linux-gnu/egcs-2.93.08/specs
gcc version egcs-2.93.08 19990214 (gcc2 ss-980929 experimental)
=> Binutils Version:
binutils-2.9.1.0.19a
=> LIBC Version:
glibc-2.0.112
Any suggestions ? ( BTW: 2.1.131 works great )
