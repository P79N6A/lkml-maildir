This patch doesn't prevent another application from getting more INQUIRY
bytes.  What it does change is how much data the SCSI scanning loop looks
for.  That data is requested, and then thrown away.  It's not kept around
for anything.
If it were kept, I'd agree with you.  But it's not.  Some useful data is
copied out of the INQUIRY result, and then the buffer is overwritten by the
next probing request.
I can't see any code in the SCSI scanning section that looks beyond the
first 36 bytes.
Also, some devices just die if the INQUIRY is anything but 36-bytes.  Since
all the data beyond the first 36 is considered vendor-specific, I would
expect a driver to _check_ the first 36 bytes to see if this is an
apropriate device, and then (and only then) request more data.

It's not that hard.  No matter what the problem is, tell the customer 
to reinstall Windows.
