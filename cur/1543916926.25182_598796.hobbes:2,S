I'm relieved. I really started to go nuts on this contradicting

Your box seems to be worse than the VAIO, it has some random surprise

Should be fine. The check is there since late 2.6.21-rc. I really could
kick my own ass that I did not remember the nx6325 wreckage in the
2.6.21-rc time frame. Sigh, way too much broken hardware out there to
keep track of it.
