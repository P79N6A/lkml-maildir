Hahahaha, this is clearly the funniest posting on this list this
year. It's so funny I just had to print it and put it up on the wall.
John, just one question: if you belive in that rubbish, why on earth
do you waste your time on this crap old-fashioned operating system
called Linux?
Forget it, people have been trying to design the perfect operating
system to replace UNIX the last 10 years and still people keep coming
crawling back to something that has proved itself to work. All the
cooporate money being put behind Linux now is just not going to be
switched to some vapor OS of the month at the rate they come out.
It's quite amazing actually, UNIX was designed so many years ago and
still they managed to get so many things right .... quite impressive
actually.
