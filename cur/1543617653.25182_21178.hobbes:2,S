Some NFS servers only accept connections from 'secure ports' < 1024. 
You need one local port per connections. Some Ports <1024 are already
used by other services. This a natural limit with secure ports.
If you can configure your NFS server to not insist on secure ports
(it's usually an export option, unfortunately defaulting to on with
many OS) you can just use any ports. With the appended patch it should
work
[should be probably a sysctl instead of an #ifdef, but I'm too lazy
for that right now] 
Another way if you wanted to avoid source patching would be to make
sure that different connections go via different source IP addresses;
e.g. by defining multiple IP aliases on the server and the client and 
defining different routes for the server aliases with different local
ip addresses as prefered from address (=from option in iproute2). 
This way the ports would be unique again because they're for multiple local 
IP addresses; you would have 800 ports per local IP. Using the patch is 
probably cleaner though. 
Hope this helps,
