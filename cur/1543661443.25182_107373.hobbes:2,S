Hello All!
Top-posting and replying to my own mail. Let's hope this at least is
useful for someone :-)
An update on the issue described below: The "mem=2047M" only _seemed_ to
solve the problem. The machine booted, but processes accessing the
RAID-array mount (/wrk) froze and became unkillable in a "D-state"
(immortal is the wrong word; they weren't alive).
The foolproof method of creating these processes was running bonnie++ -f,
a few seconds after "Rewriting..." all access to /wrk died. Impossible to
kill the processes with "kill -9" either (is there an even deadlier way?)
This happened on all kernels I tested, 2.4.19, 2.4.20, 2.4.21-pre4.
Unfortunately I couldn't test the -ac patches, as they needed a header
file missing on my system, sched_runqueue.h. Failed to locate it anywhere
else also.
So I now compiled the 2.2.23 kernel, and it (again) _seems_ to be running
OK. At least bonnie++ finishes. Now there's only the occasional spinlocks
that get stuck...
Anyway, if someone has a similar system, DP264/Tsunami/2*EV67, and can't
get things working with the DAC960 and 2.4, you can take some comfort in
the fact that you are not alone.
Just realized that I should have checked with a non SMP kernel, to see if
that would have made a difference.
Finally, if there are any wise persons out there who would benefit from
more precise information in efforts to solve this, I will be very glad to
help out.
Have a nice day,
    Mikael J.
