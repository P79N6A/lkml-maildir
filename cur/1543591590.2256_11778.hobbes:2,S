You can use the -I feature to ignore some keywords, but not the
functions they modify.  Without ignoring __initdata, for instance, you
get a couple hundred tags for it, and none for the actual variable,
e.g. cpu_vendor_names.  My current ignore list for the kernel is at
http://www.osc.edu/~pw/ctags-ignore
 .
If you really want to see the EXPORT_SYMBOL(tag) lines, you'll want
to remove that one from the list (and be sure to do the sorting...),
Next, the wonderful editor Vim doesn't read my mind quite well enough.
When I want to see the tag for "page", for example, I really
want to look at the definition of the struct in include/linux/mm.h, not
at any of the 16 other places which declare a variable struct page *page;.
So I run the tags file through a perl script which percolates those
interesting items to the top when there are multiple entries for the
same identifier.  It's here: 
http://www.osc.edu/~pw/sort-tags
 .
Finally, I modify the Makefile to generate tags with these
modifications. Here's the snippet: 
tags: dummy
	( find include/asm-$(ARCH) -name "*.h" ;\
	  find include -type d \( -name "asm-*" -o -name config \) -prune \
	  -o -name "*.h" -print ; find $(SUBDIRS) init -name '*.[chS]' ) |\
	ctags -I../ctags-ignore -L - -f - | sort-tags > tags
Note that this only generates tags for your current architecture,
and that your ctags must be Exuberant and version >= 5.0.
