There is a 'quirks=' parameter that can be passed to the usbhid driver. 
Unfortunately the need for IGNORE_QUIRK went away when the whole hid stuff 
got converted to proper bus with proper drivers.
But for backward userspace compatibility we want to have the 
HID_IGNORE_QUIRK in place, solely for the purpose of users being able to 
specify it during the module load, I agree. I currently have this queued 
in my tree.
