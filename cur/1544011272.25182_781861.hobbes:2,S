As Benjamin said, it was decided to use David Howells work. I hope it
will allow simple usage model DST has, but since there is no code yet, I
have my own.
If David will not push it upstream I think it could be possible to move
DST's thread pool outside of the storage project. I can review any
submitted pool implementation if being copied, but so far will carry own
implementation in the DST sources. If David will not push his code we
can return to my implementation.
