Subject: Re: [PATCH] Allow NULL pointers in percpu_free

The patch (as824b) makes percpu_free() ignore NULL arguments, as one
would expect for a deallocation routine.  (Note that free_percpu is
#defined as percpu_free in include/linux/percpu.h.)  A few callers are
updated to remove now-unneeded tests for NULL.  A few other callers
already seem to assume that passing a NULL pointer to percpu_free() is
okay!
The patch also removes an unnecessary NULL check in percpu_depopulate().

Smaller???!!!  How on earth do you think that could happen?  When you
don't use unlikely() there are fewer restrictions on the compiler; hence
it should be free to generate smaller code without the annotation than
with it.  Unless maybe you don't set CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE, which 
ought to be a much better way of getting small kernels...

Okay, here's the revised patch.
