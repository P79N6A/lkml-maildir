For slackware users too (no distro kernel fixes), this is first time 
I switch a couple boxen to 2.6 series full time.  Compared to running 
the late 2.3.99 - early 2.4 years ago (on redhat6.2) where one 
switched between main or -ac depending on current stability :)
Back when Jeff fiddling with tulips?
