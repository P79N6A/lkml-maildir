Yep. Its there, but I see in the 2.6.28 dmesg:
  PM-Timer running at invalid rate: 87% of normal - aborting.
Which means its being disqualified.
Looking at the dmesg diff I see:
-TSC: PIT calibration confirmed by PMTIMER.
-TSC: using PMTIMER calibration value
-Detected 1499.820 MHz processor.
+TSC: PIT calibration deviates from PMTIMER: 1309343 1499790.
+TSC: Using PIT calibration value
+Detected 1309.343 MHz processor.
So it seems the PIT is having some sort of issue, which causes the TSC
to be miscalibrated (apparently causing the fast timekeeping in 2.6.28
you're seeing) and in addition it also is disqualifying the acpi_pm
clocksource. 
Alas, the circular "what do we trust" issue bites us again.
The TSC calibrate code was reworked recently, but that should have been
in 2.6.27 (if I'm reading the git commit dates properly), so right off I
don't know what to blame.
Ingo/Thomas: Any ideas here?
Miklos: Can you try bisecting this down some?
thanks
