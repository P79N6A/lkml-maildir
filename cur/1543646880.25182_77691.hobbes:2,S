get_device()/put_device(). When struct device::refcount hits 0, it's 
cleaned up. c.f. drivers/base/core.c::put_device(). 
The bus type that the device belongs to always owns it, and could easily
be put in struct bus_type. Basically, it tells the bus that it's finally
ok to free the structure. That's not done by the driver core, since the 
struct device is (so far) always embedded in a bus-specific structure. 
Thoughts? Suggestions?
