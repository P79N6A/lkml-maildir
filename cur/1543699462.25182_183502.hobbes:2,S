No, they are not identical and should not be.
Unlike df, which reads the used counter from the filesystem
meta information, du iterates over files within directories.
If you have a file without a name (created, still open, all
links removed), it does not exist in any directory but it
does exist in the filesystem. So df should show the space
used for it, while du should not.
