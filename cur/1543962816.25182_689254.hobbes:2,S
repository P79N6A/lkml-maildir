Well, if IRQ 19 got disabled, that's your SATA controller, so resume 
likely isn't going to work. Could be a libata problem? CCing linux-ide.
BTW, if your BIOS offers an option to enable AHCI on your SATA 
controller then that would be a more optimal configuration (could get 
NCQ support), but that is an aside.
