Would it be better to do something like
--- a/drivers/serial/serial_core.c~a
+++ a/drivers/serial/serial_core.c
@@ -1686,9 +1686,12 @@ static int uart_line_info(char *buf, str
 		pm_state = state->pm_state;
 		if (pm_state)
 			uart_change_pm(state, 0);
-		spin_lock_irq(&port->lock);
-		status = port->ops->get_mctrl(port);
-		spin_unlock_irq(&port->lock);
+		status = 0;
+		if (port->info) {

so that a) we treat all uart types in the same way and b) the same problem
doesn't occur later with some other driver which is assuming an opened
device in its ->get_mctrl() handler?
