I had a bit of trouble reviewing this one because I was laughing so hard at
the attempted coding-style in that driver.  Oh well.
I continue creeping into Christoph's camp - there's quite a bit of
open-coded gunk which would go away if we were to teach this driver about
kthread_should_stop() and kthread_stop(), and the conversion looks awfully
easy to do.  It's a shame to stop here.
Oh well, I guess at least this is some forward progress.
