In a somewhat beta. 
We're working on our ease-of-use. 
Release 3.0.19 of STP, available at Sourceforge
(
http://sourceforge.net/projects/stp
 )
and via BK
( bk://developer.osdl.org tag: release_3.0.19 )
adds an email gateway, so you can submit test requests without
the Web. 
I am looking for a few beta testers. 
Grab the kit and email me if you're interested in using.
