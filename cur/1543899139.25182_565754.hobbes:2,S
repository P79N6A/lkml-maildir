Please have a look to kernel bug #7372:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7372
It seems I encountered the almost same issue.
The fix on my side, beside running 2.6.17 (which was working fine for me) was to:
 1) have /proc/sys/vm/vfs_cache_pressure=1
 2) have /proc/sys/vm/dirty_ratio=1 and /proc/sys/vm/dirty_background_ratio=1
 3) have /proc/sys/vm/swappiness=2
 4) run Peter Zijlstra: per dirty device throttling patch on the top of 2.6.21.5:

Hope that helps,
