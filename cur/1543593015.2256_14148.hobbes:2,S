You still run with MPS 1.1.
It should be 3 or 19 after you reboot with MPS 1.4.
Could you please try the following commands as root, but just before
rebooting. It'll kill the USB controller.
#setpci -s 00:07.2 INTERRUPT_LINE=15
#lspci -vx -s 00:07.2
<<< 0x3C should be 15
#setpci -s 00:07.2 INTERRUPT_LINE=19
#lspci -vx -s 00:07.2
<<< 0x3C is now either 19 or 3
