It's not a hugely strange worry no. Grepping around (for num_online_cpus for 
example) didn't throw up any glaring bugs I believe.
A possible problem in mm/vmstat.c:calculate_threshold() where 3 CPUs would 
be treated as 2 through an fls(). No idea about that code and if that would 
be a problem.
The line just below where it does that _does_ seem to have a problem:
         /*
          * Maximum threshold is 125
          */
         threshold = min(125, threshold);
as either the comment or the code is wrong and it seems it's the code. Added 
Andrew Morton to the CC for that.
CFS (v19.1) has an ilog2 on num_online_cpus() in 
kernel/sched.c:sched_init_granularity() but this seems not a problem. Added 
Ingo Molnar.
Rene.
