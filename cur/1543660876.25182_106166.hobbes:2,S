Safe or not safe depends highly on the kind of hardware we are talking
about. To clarify: 1024x768 is not a problem on most new PCs bought
today. For a PDA or embedded system you maybe only have 320x244. 
My point was rather, if the graphics hardware cannot display a graphical
bootup without drawbacks, it does not hurt to disable it and go back to
text.
