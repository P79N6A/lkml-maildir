Hi,
In older kernels arch/i386/kernel/timers/timer_pm.c:verify_pmtmr_rate
contained a check for sensible PMTMR rate and disabled that clocksource
if it was found to be out of spec[0]. This check seems to have been lost
in the transition to drivers/clocksource/acpi_pm.c, the removal is in
61743fe445213b87fb55a389c8d073785323ca3e "Time: i386 Conversion - part
4: Remove Old timer_opts Code"[1] and the check is not present in the
replacement 5d0cf410e94b1f1ff852c3f210d22cc6c5a27ffa "Time: i386
Clocksource Drivers"[2].
Is there a specific reason the check was removed (I couldn't see on in
the archives) or was it simply overlooked? Without it I need to pass
clocksource=tsc to have 2.6.18 work correctly on an older K6 system with
an Aladdin chipset (will dig out the precise details if required). Would
a patch to reintroduce the check be acceptable or would some sort of
blacklist based solution be more acceptable?
Cheers,
Ian.
