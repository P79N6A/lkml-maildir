resources after auto and activate and options are now exactly the same 
after the pnpacpi patch:
resources:
state = active
io 0x100-0x107
io 0x2e8-0x2ef
irq 5
dma 3
options:
port 0x100-0x130, align 0xf, size 0x8, 16-bit address decoding
irq 3,4,5,7,10,11 High-Edge
dma 1,2,3 16-bit compatible
Dependent: 01 - Priority acceptable
    port 0x3f8-0x3f8, align 0x0, size 0x8, 16-bit address decoding
Dependent: 02 - Priority acceptable
    port 0x2e8-0x2e8, align 0x0, size 0x8, 16-bit address decoding
Dependent: 03 - Priority acceptable
    port 0x2f8-0x2f8, align 0x0, size 0x8, 16-bit address decoding
Dependent: 04 - Priority acceptable
    port 0x3e8-0x3e8, align 0x0, size 0x8, 16-bit address decoding
With pnpbios, module loading gives this:
found SMC SuperIO Chip (devid=0x5a rev=00 base=0x002e): LPC47N227
smsc_superio_flat(): fir: 0x2e8, sir: 0x100, dma: 03, irq: 5, mode: 0x0e
SMsC IrDA Controller found
  IrCC version 2.0, firport 0x2e8, sirport 0x100 dma=3, irq=5
No transceiver found. Defaulting to Fast pin select
divert: not allocating divert_blk for non-ethernet device irda0
IrDA: Registered device irda0
With pnpacpi, module loading gives this:
found SMC SuperIO Chip (devid=0x5a rev=00 base=0x002e): LPC47N227
smsc_superio_flat(): IrDA not enabled
smsc_superio_flat(): fir: 0x00, sir: 0x00, dma: 15, irq: 0, mode: 0x02
Haven't tried Villes patch yet, will do today evening.
