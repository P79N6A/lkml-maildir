Subject: smp errors in 2.4!!

I encounter this compilation error:
/usr/x.c:2112: struct has no member named
"event_Rsmp_7b16c344"
The structure has that field and I don't have the
conflicting structure name anywhere in my code and in
the system files too. 
The makefile uses sed and *.d files.
Could anyone help me out as how to fix this.
Thanks
Jalaja
