The ICH5 should be fine.  You may need to twiddle BIOS setup options, 
some users have reported that both drivers/ide and libata fail in 
certain BIOS modes.  "Enhanced - SATA only" is usually the preferred 
mode, where feasible.
You need to make sure you get the Promise SATA fixes I just pushed to 
Linus.  Presumably they will be available in the next 2.6.0-testX BK 
snapshot on ftp.kernel.org, tonight or the next night.
