Okay, so heres what I did.  I downloaded modutils version 2.4.27 and
extracted it to /usr/local/modutils
Then in my 2.4.32 kernel's Makefile, I changed the DEPMOD variable to
point to /usr/local/modutils/sbin/depmod
Then I build the kernel with:
make dep && make bzImage modules modules_install && make install
So then my initrd gets generated, I reboot to the 2.4.32 kernel, and
thats where i'm at now.
So then for instance I goto /lib/modules/2.4.32/net and do:
/usr/local/modutils/sbin/insmod 8390.o
and I see all those unresolved symbols
So maybe now that you have more info, we can figure something out.
Thanks!
