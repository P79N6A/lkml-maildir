I use MySQL pretty extensively, so I'll excersize that as well as
the day-to-day builds, etc.  I'm on day 4 of -mm1, no problems to date.
By definition, I'm happy!

I was specifically referring to the O_SYNC changes there.  That means
databases: postgresql, mysql, sapdb, etc.
Some of these use fsync()-based synchronisation and won't benefit, but they
may have compile-time or runtime options to use O_SYNC instead.
Apart from that, just using the kernel in day-to-day activity is the most
important thing.  If everyone does that, and everyone is happy then by
definition this kernel is a wrap.
