	EAGAIN is the correct value unless the read/recv was itself interrupted by a 
signal. However, the 'select' should not indicate that the socket is readable 
unless there is something to read (or an error, or whatnot). When 'select' is 
interrupted by a signal, select should return EINTR.
	My guess is that select did return EINTR, but for some reason your 
application examined the fd sets anyway. So the bug is in not ignoring the fd 
sets when select returns an error, which is an application issue.
	Most likely, 'select' never got around to touching the fd sets at all.
