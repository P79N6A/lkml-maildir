Hello for everybody.
First of all I'd like to say that we are sorry for so looong delay with 
replying.
My name is Dmitry Gryazin, and I'm a collegue of Kirill Smelkov. I'll reply to 
the issues you've raised inline:

We know about "ide_core.nodma" and we have been using it for PCISA-C3 for 
ages. But we have to support three different motherboards (some of them are 
with CF problems, some of them not) with one home-made distribution now.
So, the idea was to get it works automatically.

Yes, PCISA-C3 (with BIOS v1.3) says vendor="FIC" and name="PT-2200".
It's a pity that vendors don't care to correctly assign DMI IDs, so that we 
can't fully rely on them.
As Bartlomiej suggests, one of the way to solve this problem is to use IDE 
controller as additional criterion to decide on which port/drive DMA should 
be off.

As you suggest, we could use the following criterions:
    Board vendor="FIC"		&&
    Board name="PT-2200"	&&
    VIA-family IDE controller	&&
    drive type=CF
It should work good enough.
To test it I also tried to install external IDE CF adaptor to the secondary 
IDE controller (both master and slave). And it's also identified as CF drive 
type. And we turn off DMA for it. But since external CF adaptor could be 
wired right, turning DMA off would be incorrect in some cases.
Yes, _that_ particular external IDE/CF adaptor that we bought, has the same  
problem, so turning DMA off on it should be correct. We even decided to 
verify ourselves that wrong soldering is the cause of problems, and wired 
manually necessary pins, and, voila, DMA works. So the question is:
    Is it right to implement the above-mentioned criterion, which would work 
    correctly in 99 cases of 100, but will pessimistically turn DMA off in
    rare cases (e.g. rightly wired external IDE/CF adaptor attached to
    PCISA/C3), or is the whole problem unsolvable?
We could not come up with the right criterion which selects exactly on-board 
CF slot, so if there is no satisfactory 100% reliable solution maybe it 
doesn't make sense to continue...
We ask for help and advice what to do now.
Thanks beforehand,
Dmitry, Kirill.
