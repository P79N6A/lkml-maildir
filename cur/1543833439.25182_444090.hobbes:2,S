Ok.  Stepping back a little ways.
We need a formula for doing incremental development that will allow us to
make headway while not seeing the entire picture all at once.  The scope
is just too large.
The usual pattern is for someone to do implement the code in the order
and the fashion that seems obvious and then to reimplement it with a
history that is aids code reviews, and makes it obvious what is
happening.  The reimplementation results in the exact same code but
the steps to get there are different.
We can either do that as individuals or as a group.  But that
is the only pattern I know of that allows us to be comprehensive
when we merge and fall short during development.
