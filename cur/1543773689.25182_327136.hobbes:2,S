Having it built statically but unused by any other domain but Linux is 
basically like having local_irq_disable() and friends as out-of-line 
code, still with real hw masking, but with all interrupts going through 
the I-pipe's interrupt handler before being dispatched to the regular 
Linux handler.
OTOH, having the I-pipe as an unloaded module leaves the original 
interrupt path untouched (at least on x86), but requires a boolean check 
into each stall/unstall/test operations, and a few more (~4) in the 
interrupt path just to make sure that we are operating in real or 
virtual (i.e. pipelined) mode, IOW to check if the pipelining engine is 
engaged or not, and further decide if we should use the CPU or I-pipe 
masking ops. The other solution would have been to play the function 
pointer game in order to reach the pipelined/non-pipelined operations 
depending on the box being i-piped or not, but I was unsure of the 
impact on performances.
