Subject: [PATCH] remove gratuitous space in airo module description
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Currently the modinfo looks like:
description:    Support for Cisco/Aironet 802.11 wireless ethernet                    cards.  Direct support for ISA/PCI/MPI cards and support               for PCMCIA when used with airo_cs.
Arguably, it should be cut at the end of the first sentence. 
This at least makes it somewhat more legible.
