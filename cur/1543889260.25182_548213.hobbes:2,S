I hope to get some breathing space next week, then I'll get back to
VFS work.  I'd rather do that one myself, since it'll be a long series
of equivalent transformations - debugging such rewrite of refcounting

is near the top of the list (another thing is wading through several
threads from hell and reviewing unionfs ;-/)
