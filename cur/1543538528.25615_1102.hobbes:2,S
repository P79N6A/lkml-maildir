Ok. Then I'll write short explanation (enough to understood discussed
problem). GRUB is bootloader. It DOES NOT use linux's kernel to parse
partition tables and access disk via /dev/hda1 or /dev/hda10. Instead
it has it's own mechanism to find list of partitions and placement of
partitions on disk (it needs such mechanism anyway since THE SAME CODE
is used on bootup when there are no /dev/hda1 but only BIOS's disk 0x80
instead of /dev/hda :-). So even if you ask it to install inself on
linux's partition it'll NOT use /dev/hda1. It will write to /dev/hda in
known (from partition table) place. The question is: how to ask linux
to re-read this new information and not trash it afterwards ? Or there
are just no way to access boot sector of MOUNTED (you can not unmount
root partition, right?) /dev/hda1 via /dev/hda and then ask linux kernel
to update internal tables. Program will do it from root, of course so it
can do privileged oprations just fine. If there are NO way to do so
via /dev/hda1 it'll be acceptable if it's reliable doable via /dev/hda1 at
least (it'll require quite a lot of changes in GRUB but if it's the only
choice then...).

cfdisk can alter partition label, for example. Partition label sits not
in partition table but in filesystem, so for fdisk this problem also exists.

It worked in 2.2 (with ugly kludge but WORKED). We need SOME way to do some
with 2.4 (it's needed for LiLo as well if you are installing LiLo in /dev/hda1
and not in /dev/hda).

You are NOT installing GRUB (or LiLo) 10 times per minute. No matter how
costly synchronization is if we have way to force it we are saved.

I'm not know how to hold superblock lock from userspace unfortunatelly :-/
