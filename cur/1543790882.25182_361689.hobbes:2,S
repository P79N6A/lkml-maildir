Subject: [PATCH] net/core/filter.c, kernel 2.6.14
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Before, the socket filter would apply the filter, then, while running through the steps of the filter on each packet, it would check for division by zero. This patch checks for division by zero (when dividing by a constant) in sk_chk_filter() so the filter won't be applied if a divide-by-zero instruction is found.
This patch is a diff from kernel version 2.6.14.
