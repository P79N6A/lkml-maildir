If you define an array, AFAIK the controller doesn't do anything physically to 
the discs. It's just the settings it tells the promise driver (thus software 
RAID). If you define ANY array, the drives should still be detected by Linux 
individually and you can use linux/md to RAID them.
This is how I'm doing it on my older PATA promise card.
