Hi,
You just said:
> BUG 1: playing DOOM causes the system to hang.
:) well, don't play DOOM then...
Seriously though, the data you provide is far from being sufficient to
even start debugging it.
> BUG 2: ("FORK"ING CONTINUOUSLY MAKES THE SYSTEM UNSTABLE)
Naturally, and it is not a bug. Use "man setrlimit" command to learn about
resource limits that can be set under (almost) any flavour of UNIX. The
command-line interface to those things is bash's builtin command called
"ulimit". Just learn how to use it (try ulimit -aH to see the current
values and then ulimit -j to get the list of options) and you will be
able to set it to run out of resources much sooner so that you can still
shutdown gracefully.
Regards,
