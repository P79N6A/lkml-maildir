This avoids the problem of .resume methods calling userspace while 
userspace is frozen and a resulting hang, but does it actually result in 
the drivers beginning to work again? If we remove process freezing in 
STR, this should just work[1] without the need to complicate things. On 
the other hand, if we don't want to support these functions in the 
suspend and resume methods we could just audit the kernel and remove 
them all.
