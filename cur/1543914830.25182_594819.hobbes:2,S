Actually Apple Mail.app sends format=flowed wrapped to 73  
characters.  So a wrapped line has a single space character right  
before each 'wrapping' newline.  If your mail client supports  
format=flowed viewing and sends without format=flowed (like AKPM's  
mailer appears to), then it will properly unwrap the lines and resend  
without the wrapping.  Mailers which *DONT* support format=flowed  
will see the wrapped version.  Normally this is what you want but  
it's a PITA for patches and logfiles.
I believe with Mail.app if you attach a .txt file it will be  
unmangled and sent as "Content-Type: text/plain" and "Content- 
Disposition: inline", so most email-clients will display it as part  
of the message.
