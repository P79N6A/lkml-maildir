Just one minor point:

This no longer seems to be an appropriate name.  How about
set_address_top_reserve or something?
void set_address_top_reserve(unsigned long reserve)
{
	BUG_ON(fixmaps > 0);
#ifdef CONFIG_COMPAT_VDSO
	BUG_ON(reserve != 0);
#else
	__FIXADDR_TOP = -reserve - PAGE_SIZE;
	__VMALLOC_RESERVE += reserve;
#endif
}
(I *think* I got the logic here correct).
Rusty.
