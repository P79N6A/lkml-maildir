then if you choose to umount your devfs in order to use the old /dev/
entries, you get an error message, have to umount /dev/shm first, which
may be used by apps, ....

there is the no_mount option...
As for mount, the fhs _requires_ mount to be available at early boot
time (you've always the possibilty to make /bin, /sbin & /usr some fs to
mount :-). You just can't manage all impossible cases)
