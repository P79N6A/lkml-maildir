I tried to make it clear that I am clearly lacking expertise in this
topic. I am currently working on a somewhat related topic and was hoping
to get some reactions that would point me in the right directions as it
is somewhat hard to judge the VFS design when you do not have prior
experience in writing a file system on your own. Nowhere did I ask for a
10 paged review on the matter.
Enough blablabla
Any input would be welcome. Thanks.
