Hello,
Thinking a bit further, I came up with the following point:
When configuring a kernel for i686, two things happen in the makefile.
1) Code is compiled with -D686 instead of -D586 or -D486, etc. Therefore,
some
CPU-dependant code for i686 will be generated, depending on #defines in the
source.
2) The code is compiled with -march=i686 instead of -march=i586 or
-march=i486, etc.
So to nail down if the problem is in the compiler or in kernel source, you
can change arch/i386/Makefile to compile code with -march=i586 instead of
-march=i686 when configured for CPU type i686.
If your problems then disappears, it's a bug in your compiler version. You
said you were using the stock RH6.1 compiler; which compiler is that?
egcs1.1.2? gcc2.95.2? Or a different version?
If the problem persists, it could indeed be a bug in i686 specific code in
the kernel.
Regards,
--Tim
