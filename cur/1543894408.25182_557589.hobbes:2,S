BSD licenses encourage forking.  Specifically, if a BSD-licensed project 
becomes significantly commercially valuable, there's an incentive for 
companies to hire your developers away to work on a proprietary fork.
When Sun Microsystems started up in 1982, they hired away Bill Joy to work on 
a closed version of BSD (SunOS).  When Berkeley shut down the CSRG, BSDi 
hired those developers to work on another closed source BSD variant.  More 
recently, Apple hired people like Jordan Hubbard away from FreeBSD to do yet 
another fork: MacOS X.  The loss of people hurts the original project.
With BSD licensed code, companies can say "work on the codebase you love as a 
day job, and you can still work on the open version at night".  Then work 
them 90 hours/week.  Or even "we'll release this code open source after we 
can't sell it anymore, a year or two from now".  And then the deadline never 
comes, or the codebase is irrelevant by then, or too far diverged to merge.  
You won't get all the developers, but you'll get enough to cost the open 
project momentum.  BSD is 30 years old and the free version is still a pale 
shadow of its proprietary forks like MacOS X or the bits of it Windows 
incorporated.
Now think about trying to do that to a GPL project.  If you hire the 
developers away, they have to work on a _different_ codebase.  Much less 
compelling, both for the hirer and the hiree.  If you think Linux is 
compelling enough to commercialize, you MUST do so within the terms of the 
GPL or not do it at all.  You can't do a closed fork and distribute the 
result.  Maybe this means companies aren't as quick to jump on the bandwagon 
trying to commercialize it, but the project can then grow larger without 
interference until commercial participation _is_ compelling, on its own 
merits, despite being unable to corner the market on it.

It's not political, it's pragmatic.  GPLv2 has tangible benefits for project 
maintainers.

Nobody objects to the FSF putting out new licenses if it changes its mind 
about what it wants to do.  They object to it pestering those of us 
continuing to use the old license because we prefer it to the new one.
The FSF _does_ draw the line in a different place than the Linux developers.  
Hence the Linux developers don't want to use the new license, they prefer the 
old one from back before Stallman went insane.  They have that right, and 
Stallman trying to deny them that right in the name of "freedom" is deeply 
ironic.

It's not the FSF's code being licensed.  It's the Linux developers' code being 
licensed.  The people who write the code get to choose the license.

Why is Linus's opinion less valuable than Stallman's when it comes to the 
license under which the project Linus founded, and which Linus still 
maintains, is distributed?

Exactly.  And Linus likes GPLv2.  As do I.
