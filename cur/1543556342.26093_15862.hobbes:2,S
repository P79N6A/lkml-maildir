   Erm... Not that ignoring the return values was a bright idea, but the
   lack of reliable ordered datagram protocol in IP family is not a good
   thing. It can be implemented over TCP, but it's a big overkill. IL is a
   nice thing to have...
You mean RDP (Reliable Data Protocol), RFC-908 and RFC-1151?  It
provides reliable (i.e., will handle retransmission and dropping
duplicate) datagrams with optional sequencing guarantees if requested by
the application (but if you don't need sequencing, you don't have to pay
for it).  It's built on top of IP.  It's specified, but it never become
popular.  But it *is* a member of the IP family, however neglected and
ignored it might be.
