Well, after a lot of talking here's the second version of the Balanced
Multi Queue Scheduler :
http://www.xmailserver.org/linux-patches/mss-2.html
The patch is described inside the link that contains tests on UP and 2
way SMP systems.
The latency is dramatically improved even if my first focus has been the
balancing code.
As soon as OSDLAB will grant me access on 8 way ( and 16 way ) SMP
machines more tests will follow.
