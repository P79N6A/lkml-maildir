AT91 _is_ defined with the arch_is_coherent() switch set to 0 (in 
include/asm-arm/memory.h and not overloaded).

Ok it is bad but, in AT91, all memory is accessible with DMA.

True, the oops appears after a mmc switch command (#6 command).

Not sure I can add much to what Hugh has said. If you need some more 
precision anyway, I will try to answer.
