Andrea - please just shut up. 
Until you can point to anything even _remotely_ as good as BitKeeper,
there's no point in just continually trying to start a flame-war.
I agree that Larry ends up being a jerk about it too, but I can well see 
that he reacts negatively to your totally unproductive comments. 
BK has the email in the meta-data already, and a lot of tools to extract 
all the necessary data from mailboxes etc. 
In other words, your argument is nonexistant, and your whole posting is 
pointless - except as flame-bait. And yes, Larry likely _will_ eat your 
bait, something I've berated him for in private emails several times.
So shut up or put up. Go off and write your own tool. In the meantime, 
stop complaining about people who wrote _their_ tools and selected a 
license that you wouldn't choose.
When you write some code of your own, you get to choose the license. And I 
haven't seen you make CVS usable - I've only seen you bitch, moan, and 
complain..
