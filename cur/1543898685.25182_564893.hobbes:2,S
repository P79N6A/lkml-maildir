Thanks, this is the way I wanted to see it go in the generic code. (ie.
get rid of lazy_mmu_prot_uptdate and actually follow the cacheflush API
instead).
The only thing I noticed when I looked at the code is that some places
may not have flushed icache when they should have? Did you get them all?
Minor nitpick: you have one place where you test VM_EXEC before flushing,
but the flush routine itself contains the same test I think?
Regarding the ia64 code -- I'm not an expert so I can't say whether it
is the right thing to do or not. However I still can't work out what it's
rationale for the PG_arch_1 bit is, exactly. Does it assume that
flush_dcache_page sites would only ever be encountered by pages that are
not faulted in? A faulted in page kind of is "special" because it is
guaranteed uptodate, but is the ia64 arch code relying on that? Should it?
(there could definitely still be flush_dcache_page called on mapped pages,
but it should only be a subset of all possible sites -- I don't know if it
is too clean for ia64 cacheflush code to know that?). [*]
[*] all this is, as usual, predicated by the disclaimer that quirks in mm/
can result in mapped pages not being uptodate (in which case hell often
breaks loose in other ways anyway).
