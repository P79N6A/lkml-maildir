I've managed to get my AGP G400 working in the following setups under
2.6.0 since -test7:
with Petr's patch, reverting to 2.4 interfaces:
  video=matroxfb:vesa:0x1bb gives me a great fbcon.  I can either use
  X's fbdev driver at the same resolution, or the mga driver at any
  resolution, with no problems.
without Petr's patch:
  video=matroxfb:vesa:0x1bb gives me a great fbcon.  I can only use
  X's fbdev driver at the same resolution; the mga driver at any
  resolution causes massive console corruption upon switching from X to
  console and causing any screen changes.  Also, I get a large white
  block underneath the logo on boot.
