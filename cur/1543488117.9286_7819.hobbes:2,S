I am having the same problem with 2.2.1 but while trying to "ls" in a ftp
session. The ftp server runs on the 2.2.1 and the commands are chrooted to
a NFS mounted directory.
Mar  2 19:59:20 atlante ftpd[23856]: exiting on signal 11
I have no problem when doing it on a the NFS server and executing ls
directly from bash. 
The ls comand is ELF statically linked.
atlante:/home/people/bin # ldd ./ls
        statically linked (ELF)
I thought before was just a problem of the executable (the ftp server bins
came from slackware 3.0) so I've got the ls sources and compiled (with
a lot of hack in the stat struct functions) on our current distribution
(SuSE 5.2 and "everything" upgraded, i.e. bin-utils, wu-ftpd,
net-tools...).
Take care.
