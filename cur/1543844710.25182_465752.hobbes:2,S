Well I don't recall ever having seen a "cpu to node relationship fixup
take1" and I have generally lost the plot regarding these fixes.
What I have now is:
cpu-to-node-relationship-fixup-take2.patch
cpu-to-node-relationship-fixup-map-cpu-to-node.patch
I shall send those patches in reply to this email.  Please confirm that
these are correct, sufficient, complete, etc.
Do you believe these are needed in 2.6.18.x?
Please follow the guidelines in
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/stuff/tpp.txt
 a little more
closely, especially regarding Subject:s
Please bear in mind that I'm sitting on thousands of patches from hundreds
of developers, that I process sometimes hundreds of patches per day and I
am very easily confused.  Retaining consistent and well-thought out
Subject:s and referring to previous patches via their precise Subject:s
really helps, thanks.
