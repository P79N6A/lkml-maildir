Ok can you please do so then?  Or stop your obstructism? 
I believe my patch will and according to the test results I had so far 
from other people it also works fairly well. If it doesn't work
on your systems I can fix it of course, but I need something more
concrete to work with; not just some speculation.

Again when you see "XT-PIC" in /proc/interrupts then you're not in IO-APIC
mode.
I think Len refers to the case of the PIC being routed through the IO-APIC,
but that is a different case and you won't see XT-PIC, but "IO-APIC-level" 
usually.

Well it doesn't make sense. When you have XT-PIC you're not in IO-APIC 
mode and the timer override is a nop because it only changes how the 
IO-APICs are programmed. 
Long ago there used to be a condition where ACPI would fall back
to XT-PIC mode if something went wrong -- perhaps you're thinking
of this case -- but that code was dropped a long time ago.

Your objections don't make sense, so you can NAK all day.  You're
talking about timer overrides in PIC mode which is just pure non sense.
Ok if you're unwilling to test I'm ignoring you in the future.
Please stop sending me email.
