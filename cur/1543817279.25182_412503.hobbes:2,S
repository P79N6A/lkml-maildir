Not if compliation speed is the primary explicit design goal from day one, and 
they regression test with that in mind.
Keep in mind that the main use of tcc these days is to turn c into a scripting 
language.  Just start your C file with
#!/usr/bin/tcc -run
And notice that #! is a preprocessor comment line as far as tcc is 
concerned. :)

They're still sort of related.  The sad part is that tcc is -><- this close to 
building an unmodified linux kernel, as tccboot demonstrates.  But Fabrice 
seems to have gone "ooh, shiny!" off in another direction, for entirely 
understandable reasons... :)
I'm sure somebody will go take a whack at it sooner or later.  (I haven't got 
time either.)
