Hi Andrew, Everyone,
If this new use of idr.c as a sparse bitmap catches on, it might deserve
a new flavor which would not waste the space for the pointer array
at the lowest layer.
When I wrote the original code, I was thinking of allocating process
id values where there is a tradition of allocating sequential values.
George Anzinger rewrote most of my code.  The r in idr.c is for
immediate reuse.  His version picks the lowest available bit in the
sparse bitmap.  The RESERVED_BITS comments seem to be stale.
The rational for avoiding immediate reuse of id values is to catch
application errors.   Consider:
	fd1 = open_like_call(...);
	read(fd1,...);
	close(fd1);
	fd2 = open_like_call(...);
	write(fd1...);
If fd2 has a different value than the recently closed fd1, the
error is detected immediately.
