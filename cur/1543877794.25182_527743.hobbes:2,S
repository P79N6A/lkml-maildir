No, it is not planned to change this behavior.
In fact mwait does certain power savings but the
core won't enter the C1 state. And power savings from
entering C1 are greater than power savings caused
by mwait (on AMD Fam10).

Why is that?
MONITOR/MWAIT is usable. And I think this should
be indicated by cpuinfo.
It's just inappropriate to use it in pm_idle.
