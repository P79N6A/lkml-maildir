Isn't this what I said?

That's what I proposed. Define CONFIG_PM as what we have now, or define a
new HAS_PM define to indicate that PM is present in some form, and be able
to add other schemes when/if they happen ("easily handle any new PM
method").
Ex:
 #define HAS_PM ( CONFIG_ACPI | CONFIG_APM | CONFIG_IMTU )
One master symbol to indicate that PM is present in any form.

Which could be handled by HAS_PM_SLEEP, HAS_PM_SUSPEND, HAS_PM_POWEROFF
and the like, if that seems desirable.
I can't see this being totally non-messy, but the config could probably be
clever and grey out anything which can't be done at all for the hardware
selected.
