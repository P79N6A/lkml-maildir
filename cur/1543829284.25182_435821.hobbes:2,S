No. And problem with force migrating things is that we lose the
cpus_allowed mask that has been carefully configured.
For this reason, I'm also in favour of #4, however we would need
a solution for swsusp.

Yes, I don't see why swsusp tasks would need to be migrated and
run. OTOH, this would require more swsusp special casing, but
apparently that's encouraged ;)

They'll be in the global tasklist, so there should be no reason why
they couldn't be migrated over to an online CPU with taskset. Shouldn't
require any rewrites, IIRC.
But after swsusp comes back up, it will be bringing up the same number
of CPUs as went down, won't it? So you shouldn't get into that
situation where you'd need to kill stuff, should you?
