That can very much be it, my box has 3G RAM.. I'll try checking that 
this Saturday (tomorrow hence), though I already ordered an RMA for the 
board :) Anyway, I can't live with 2G only, so that's not an option for 
me. Ordered one from nForce3, it's reported to be stable in the similar 
environment. Wonder if that's only nForce4 issue...
Cheers,
