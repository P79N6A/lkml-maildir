I'm currrently travelling. I won't be back in my office till late
sunday or monday. It's likely that I have missed mails and I apologise.
I'll do my best to track them down on monday. I certainly have been
unable to reply to all mails - for one thing, not all were cc'ed to me,
which meant that I had to trawl lk, and for another, well, I likely
just missed em. I get hundreds of mails a day. Do send it to me again.
Peter
