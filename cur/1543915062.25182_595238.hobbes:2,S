I switched mailer after I learnt about flowed stuffs. Still,
appreciated.

Well, you see, you have this very odd configuration where:
11GB highmem
 1GB normal
pagecache pages go into highmem
buggerheads go into normal
I'm guessing there is no pressure at all on zone_highmem so the
kernel will not try to reclaim pagecache. And because the pagecache
pages are happily sitting there, the buggerheads are pinned and do not
get reclaimed.
