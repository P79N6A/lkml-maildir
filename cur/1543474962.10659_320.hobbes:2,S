Is this really necessary?
I've always found UNFSD quite good and featureful, and I find the way it
resolves permissions based on path names very useful.  (A feature KNFSD
does not have).
I thought the only downside to UNFSD was it's lack of threading, making
it slow for heavy use.  A clone based version would fix this, no?
