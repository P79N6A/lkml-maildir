Kyle made a proposal but I like to get in to the party too...

We recently discussed a common prefix for the selctable symbols
and consensus pointed out "HAVE_" so let us try to use it.
I did not quite understand the "depends on 64BIT" in Kyles example.
Does we really want to use compat_binfmt_elf for all archs that
define 64BIT? Anyway I added this in the example below.
fs/Makefile:
obj-$(COMPAT_BINFMT_ELF) += compat_binfmt_elf.o
fs/Kconfig:
config COMPAT_BINFMT_ELF
	depends on HAVE_COMPAT_BINFMT_ELF || 64BIT
# COMPAT_BINFMT_ELF must be selected when an
# architecture supoorts ...
config HAVE_COMPAT_BINFMT_ELF
arch/powerpc/Kconfig:
config COMPAT
	bool
	default PPC64
	select HAVE_COMPAT_BINFMT_ELF
In the example above the extra indirection:
HAVE_COMPAT_BINFMT_ELF => COMPAT_BNFMT_ELF is not really needed
but tomorrow when we add another "depends on" to COMPAT_INFMT_ELF
it is needed to avoid the misbehaving select that just ignore the
dependencies and select the symbol anyway.
