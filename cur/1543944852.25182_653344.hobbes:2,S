Well, the registrations also exist to provide protection against
rouge/faulty remotes, but for the purposes of MPI that is probably not
important.
Here is a thought.. Some RDMA hardware can change the page tables on
the fly. What if the kernel had a mechanism to dynamically maintain a
full registration of the processes entire address space ('mlocked' but
able to be migrated)? MPI would never need to register a buffer, and
all the messy cases with munmap/sbrk/etc go away - the risk is that
other MPI nodes can randomly scribble all over the process :)
Christoph: It seemed to me you were first talking about
freeing/swapping/faulting RDMA'able pages - but would pure migration
as a special hardware supported case be useful like Catilan suggested?
