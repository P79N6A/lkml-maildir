I'm happy to buy, register, and manage a neutral domain if someone can
think of one.  Obviously, one of the BK based domains is not going to 
cut it because people will think we're using it to advertise how BK is
going to rule the world, etc. etc.  The only really neutral domain I 
have is reggaeware.com and I'm not sure the world is ready to fill their
CVS needs from cvs.reggaeware.com, eh?  
If someone can think of a cool name so we could have
    bk.coolname.com
    cvs.coolname.com
    svn.coolname.com
    etc
and it isn't taken, send me a suggestion and I'll get it set up and point it
at the right places.  
It seems to me that kernel.org is the right place but if hpa is too busy
(which I understand and respect) then we need to come up with some sort of
domain which is unused, simple, and memorable.  I'm aware of the levels of
distrust people have for bitmover but we could pay for it and run the DNS
servers and let some set of community agreed on people manage the DNS entries
if that makes people feel safe.
