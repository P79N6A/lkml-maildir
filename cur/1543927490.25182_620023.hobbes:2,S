The biggest problem we've seen with it (asides from having to rediff
it every time we rebase when there isn't a newer upstream) is complaints
along the lines of "my Fedora 7 kernel can't unpack squashfs images
from Fedora 5"
(s/Fedora 5/other random older distros/ )
If the format is now stable however, it would be great to get it upstream.
