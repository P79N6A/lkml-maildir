... and we get two wakeup_kswapd()s.  kswapd has PF_MEMALLOC and so is
able to eat memory which processes #1 and #2 are not allowed to touch.
Progress is made, clean pages are discarded and dirty ones queued for
write, memory becomes free again and the world is a better place.
Or so goes the theory, at least.
