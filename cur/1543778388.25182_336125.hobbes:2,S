sir/madam,
i written a module function similar to hello, world in C .i compiled
it.but when i ,m loading the module i'm getting the error that "the
kernel compiled is kernel 2.4.20 whereas i'm having 2.4.20-8".
wat i have to do to load it properly without forcing it to load.
did i have to change my kernel.
please suggest me a solution without changing the kernel.
