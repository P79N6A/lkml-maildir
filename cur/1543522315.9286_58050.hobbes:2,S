I'll go with 2)  Probing is always OK (unless it becomes a
denial of service).  That's why we have crack, et al.
The web will be a better place if the good guys "check the
doors" extensively.  Otherwise, you're relying on a variant
of security by obscurity.
Other possible bumper stickers...
If probing is outlawed, only the outlaws will have probes.
If you don't want probes, keep off the net.
