Is it me or does that sound like a school assignment? :)

No.
But you should be able to answer your question by wondering:
- where environment variables come from? see "man sh" or "man bash"
(in particular ENVIRONMENT section)
- how processes are handled. "man init" (in particular BOOTING section)
- where your kernel space is...
Cheers,
