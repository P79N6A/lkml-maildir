The rmmod works OK for me, in the sense that the module is removed, the
kernel doesn't crash and the module can be reloaded.
But yes, there are several locking problems in there:
- ahc_free() now sleeps, deep down in the kobject layer somewhere (it
  calls /sbin/hotplug).
  This is a likely fix for that:

- ahc_linux_kill_dv_thread() is called under ahc_list_lock(), but it sleeps.

Well we can live with the CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK_SLEEP warnings I guess. 
But you don't actually say what goes wrong when you run rmmod.  Does the
kernel oops?  Lock up?  What?
