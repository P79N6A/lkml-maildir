Pls. see below comments.

Almostly. I did more testing today. Pls. see below result list.

I tested kernel 2.6.23, 2,6,24-rc2, 2.6.24-rc2_peter(2.6.24-rc2+this patch).
1) Compare among first/second/following running
2.6.23: second run of iozone will get about 28% improvement than first run.
	Following run is very stable like 2nd run.
2.6.24-rc2: second run of iozone will get about 170% improvement than first run. 3rd run
	will get about 80% improvement than 2nd. Following run is very stable like 3rd run.
2.6.24-rc2_peter: second run of iozone will get about 14% improvement than first run. Following
	run is mostly stable like 2nd run.
So the new patch really improves the first run result. Comparing wiht 2.6.24-rc2, 2.6.24-rc2_peter
has 330% improvement on the first run.
2) Compare among different kernels(based on the stable highest result):
2.6.24-rc2 has about 50% regression than 2.6.23.
2.6.24-rc2_peter has the same result like 2.6.24-rc2.
