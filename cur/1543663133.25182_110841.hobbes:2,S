   [netdrvr] Remove superceded wireless driver aironet4500
   
   From the maintainer, Elmer Joandi(sp?):
   	aironet4500 is superseded by cisco340 drivers (airo.c) by Ben Reed
   and the  only strenght of my driver is that it allows to access absolutely
   all registers on card. Which is useful for developers only. Besides there
   is no normal interface to configure crypto in my driver, as the general
   interface is not userfriendly at all. So in fact, I use Bens driver for my
   ISP bussiness in general cases and my driver for troubleshooting.
