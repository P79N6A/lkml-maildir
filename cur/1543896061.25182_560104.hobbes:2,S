Yes
Looking a bit closer to the bisect myself, I note that 
25971f68d392f1816e21520e9e59648403b0bdad and
aba297927d1d558c7a94548135133bdf9172708a are part of
a branch that is derived from a very "old" revision.
git bisect assumes that such an old revision is good,
but in fact - that was already bad as well, because
the history of this bug is:
2.6.22-rc5 BAD
2.6.22-rc4+somethingelse BAD
2.6.22-rc4+something GOOD
2.6.22-rc4 BAD
...
2.6.18-rc1 BAD
2.6.18 GOOD
Thus: BAD BAD BAD GOOD GOOD BAD BAD
and git bisect can't handle that, even though I started
with a 'good' start point and a bad start point at the end.

This part is thus based upon a revision so old that it was bad again,
even before the small period that it was good.

No, it is really 100% reproducible.
