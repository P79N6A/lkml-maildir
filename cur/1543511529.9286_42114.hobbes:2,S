	Just noticed this in kernel logs:

Hmm - some days ago I muttered that it was a computed value
that is printed here, so unlikely to be anything recognizable,
but here it is
	/con
	fig/
	nls/
	iso8
a fragment of a pathname like
	.../linux/include/config/nls/iso8859/...
(so: tytso, I havent said anything; sct, you were right)
