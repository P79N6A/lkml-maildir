Subject: how to get IP address of current machine from C++ code?

I would like to get the IP address of one of the interfaces of the
machine that I'm currently on from within some C++ code.  It looks like
I should be able to do this by doing an
ioctl(atoi(fd, SIOCGIFADDR, &ifr)
with the interface name set in the appropriate field in ifr, but I'm not
sure how I should be getting the proper value for fd.  I would
appreciate some help on this, or if there is a better way then I'd love
to hear it.
Thanks,
Chris
