Brad,
This is a tough one because ACPI *is* power management but it is also
configuration. It is equivalent to such things as MPS table parsing, $PIR
parsing, PNPBIOS, as well as APM. The first two don't have CONFIG_ options
at the moment but they should at some point.
The only thing I can think of is a "Platform interface options" menu and
just throw all of the above in that. Any other ideas?
Regards -- Andy
