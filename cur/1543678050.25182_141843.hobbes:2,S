The guy make a real world benchmark and conclude that a 1 GHZ TM5800
with latest CMS and PTT should be comparable with 1 GHZ PIIIm.
Normally TM5800 users will say it is comparable to 600-900 MHz PIII.
About running Linux on it. Application launch time is not good
(18 sec. to launch GNOME Help, 7 sec. to relaunch). But after that
it seems like linux GUI apps are more responsive.
Building software projects seem to take longer than it should be.
Building OpenOffice.org take more than 4 days while it take
about 1-2 days on PIII. I guess the CMS has to translate 'gcc'
on every invokation?  If so, can the kernel help in any way?
Battery life and Linux should be Ok. You'll have 'longrun' utility
to control cpu power consumption vs. performance. I understand
that the CPU already control its power consumption itself, even
without the help of the kernel, right?
