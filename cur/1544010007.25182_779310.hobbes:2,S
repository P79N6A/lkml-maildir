Yes, I'm worrying this too. The lock order by cgroup_lock_hierarchy() is:
	lock A -> lock B -> lock C
But a call chain may end up with:
	... -> lock B -> ... lock A -> ...
So though this hierarchy lock proprosal can solve specific deadlock between
cpuset and memcg by making cpuset holding cgroup_lock and memcg holding hierarchy_lock,
but we'll probably encounter other deadlocks describled above.
