You can check if the counter used overflowed :
#define CTR_OVERFLOWED(n) (!((n) & (1U<<31)))
#define CTRL_READ(l,h,msrs,c) do {rdmsr(MSR_P6_PERFCTR0, (l), (h));} while (0)
                CTR_READ(low, high, msrs, i);
                if (CTR_OVERFLOWED(low)) {
			... found
like oprofile does.
I've accidentally deleted your patch, but weren't you unconditionally
returning "break out of loop" from the watchdog ? I'm not very clear on
the difference between NOTIFY_DONE and NOTIFY_OK anyway...

Shouldn't the NMI stay asserted ? At least with perfctr, two counters
causes two interrupts (actually there's a bug in mainline oprofile on
that that I'll fix when Linus is back)
