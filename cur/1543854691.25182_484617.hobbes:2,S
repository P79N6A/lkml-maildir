The gcc manual has this to say:
   Similarly, you can't expect a sequence of volatile `asm' instructions
  to remain perfectly consecutive.  If you want consecutive output, use a
  single `asm'.  Also, GCC will perform some optimizations across a
  volatile `asm' instruction; GCC does not "forget everything" when it
  encounters a volatile `asm' instruction the way some other compilers do.
I wonder how we are supposed to code the following sequence:
    asm volatile ("blah")  /* sets funky processor mode */
    some_c_code();
    asm volatile ("unblah");
Let's say "blah" disables floating point exceptions, and some_c_code() 
must run without exceptions.  Is is possible to code this in gcc without 
putting functions in another translation unit?  Is a memory clobber 
sufficient?  I'd certainly hate to use it.
