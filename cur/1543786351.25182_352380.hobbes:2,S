Subject: [PATCH 09/10] uml: comment about cast build fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/9/21/131

From: Paolo 'Blaisorblade' Giarrusso <blaisorblade@yahoo.it>
Explain why the casting we do to silence this warning is indeed safe.
It is because the field we're casting from, though being 64-bit wide, was filled
with a pointer in first place by ourselves.
