Hi,
This is the second iteration of the series of patches containing fixes and
cleanups of the PCI Express port driver.  Apart from bug fixes the patches
generally remove unnecessary things from the driver and simplify the code.
The last patch adds support for the new PCI PM framework.
I've tested these patches on a couple of machines and I'm quite confident that
they don't break things, but still more testing is always recommended. :-)
Please consider for applying.
Thanks,
Rafael
