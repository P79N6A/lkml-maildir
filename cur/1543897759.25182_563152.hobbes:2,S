It isn't common. In fact, I can only think of *ONE* instance of this - that of 
the original Quake 1 "Demo" CD that, when given the proper unlock codes, 
contained the entire game, along with all previous idsoft games.

Section 3 doesn't apply to this situation. However, other sections do. They 
are distributing in line with the distribution requirement, but not 
the "modification and copying" requirements. These are granted early in the 
license and covered by the "no further restrictions" clause.
You have to be able to copy and modify the source code for it to comply with 
the GPL.
