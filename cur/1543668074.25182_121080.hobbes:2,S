Crap! Typo in the house: should be until A decides to stop waiting for B to
finish (I should use a consistent terminology ... B was in my head the
Booster thread)
Good catch!

B's priority (Boosted) is lowered when B unlocks or when A stops waiting
(signal/timeout).
The former is the one causing trouble - now I get it to yield (unsing a
modification of sys_sched_yield()), but the priority does not seem to be
correctly lowered). I mean, it seems that it keep running with the same high
priority.

No, it has to be A's ... otherwise it is cheating :)
Thanks!
