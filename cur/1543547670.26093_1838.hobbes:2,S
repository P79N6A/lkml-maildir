My current quirk_drives from pdc202xx.c
const char *pdc_quirk_drives[] = {
        "QUANTUM FIREBALLlct08 08",
        "QUANTUM FIREBALLlct10 30",
        "QUANTUM FIREBALLlct15 30",
        "QUANTUM FIREBALLP KA6.4",
        "QUANTUM FIREBALLP LM20.4",
        "QUANTUM FIREBALLP LM20.5",
        NULL
};

Printerport is disabled in BIOS, but I have verified the existance of the problem
with the controller on different IRQ's.
I have CONFIG_PDC202XX_BURST set:
PDC20267: FORCING BURST BIT 0x00 -> 0x01 ACTIVE
.. and also checked on CONFIG_IDEDMA_AUTO, which gives no change turned on or off.

Any changes that _could_ affect my problem?
