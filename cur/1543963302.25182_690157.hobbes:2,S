Hi,
The meaning of 1 message is some fram transmit error encountered by
hardware and the I/O request is aborted by firmware because of the
error,
The second message indicates, some I/O got timed out and the SML tries
to abort the request and the firmware completes the I/O before aborting
that. Hence returns IO executed message and the driver completes the
abort as success.
Suspecting some bad hardware in the topology(cables?)
Thanks
sathya
