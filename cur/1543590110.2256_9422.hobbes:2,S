I don't see how this patch is necessary when we have
"EXTRAVERSION" available.  Change EXTRAVERSION in your kernel
builds and it is totally a non issue.  No renaming of anything is
necessary.

Signature poll:  I'm planning on getting a 12 or 16 port autosensing
10/100 ethernet switch soon for home use, and am interested in hearing
others recommendations on what to buy.  Cost isn't as important as is
functionality and quality.  Any suggestions appreciated.
