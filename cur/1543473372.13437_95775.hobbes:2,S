Hello,
About this bootp error: I don't remember who exactly told me about this,
but it was reportted to me that one Amnon (probably Amnon Shiloh) from
the Mosix project found a very similar bug which caused Linux to report
"it's me" on any arp request which it saw on the LAN in the short
interval it waited to configure its real address from bootp.
I got the impression that it was reported to the kernel developers, but
if not then you can let me know and I'll try to dig the details.
Please CC replies to me at amos@gezernet.co.il, as I'm not on the
kernel mailing list.
Cheers,
--Amos Shapira
