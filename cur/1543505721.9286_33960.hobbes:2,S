Hello!
I have weird behaviour in my "router"-box (p120, 96mt ram, ide disks,
linux 2.0.37). The box is masquerade-router for a couple of workstations
(Linux too). So, The router-box has PPP-connection to my ISP and
everything works OK if I do not have disk activity on the router-box. 
For example, if I copy/move big files on the local disks of the router-box 
the PPP-connection seems to freeze for that time.. While copying the files
on the router-box I get over 80% packet loss when pinging some
internet-server from the workstations (masquerade) at the time while the
router-box has disk-activity. 
As well, I'm not able to take ssh connections while the router-box has
disk-activity.. immediately after the disk-activity stops , ssh connection
is enabled. What's wrong?
The router-box is running Debian 2.1 (slink).
Is there solution to this problem?
