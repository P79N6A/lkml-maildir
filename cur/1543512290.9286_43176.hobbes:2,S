a) FFS is not journaling.
b) FFS is supported on Linux.
c) FFS under FreeBSD uses Kirk's softupdates. That's what you ar thinking
about.
d) s-u is not fs-specific, at least between the FFS/UFS/EXT2
e) IIRC EXT2 driver under -CURRENT also uses s-u.
f) Kirk's code seriously depends on the BSD page/buffer cache (Linux is
moving to the similar variant) _and_ on the BSD VFS.
g) Linux VFS differs. Big way.
h) The old pre-alpha code around s-u for Linux that I had in Spring is (a)
buggy and (b) depends on the old buffer cache.
