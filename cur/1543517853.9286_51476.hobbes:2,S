Hi,
I suppose there are  race conditions (or whatever) to be taken care of when
one process opens a file irregularly in append mode to write something,
while another (probably at the same time) opens it in read-only mode to
read the contents?
So far I haven't had any errors even when they do their stuff in the same
second - but I haven't tried to provoke collisions either. Should I use
lock files or something, or is it no problem if one of them only reads?
Thanks. :)
