Not sure you can go that far. I'd stick to "_fromio/_toio" transfer
blocks of data efficiently between host and bus addresses. The
guarantees are the same as readl/writel respectively with respect to the
start and end of the transfer.
[How do you define start and end addresses with memcpy_fromio(foo, bar,
4) for example ]
