I'm referring back to kernels 2.6.11, .12, .13 etc. You're at 2.6.16
or thereabouts with that distro.

Ok, there seems to be two distinct issues here. 1) Synaptics
'supersensitive' mode, 2) pointer 'freezing'.
Number 1 can not be fixed by the kernel developers (assumingly) and not
by the Synaptics X driver author. Number 2 I've seen myself, even when
using i8042.nomux, but it is _very_ sporadic on this machine.
Pointer freezing would be Dmitry's domain, but he'd have to work with
someone who can trigger it easily, and who can write scripts to capture
debug data, since it's 'hard' to move a frozen pointer to a terminal
and issue commands...
