if you're going to add that libata-related parm to the kernel parms
file, wouldn't it make sense for consistency to add the other
available boot-time parms from libata-core.c as well?  it seems
counter-productive to document only a subset of them from the same
source file.

p.s.  as i think i've mentioned before, i'd prefer to see that entire
kernel-parameters.txt file reorganized, where the basic boot time
parms are at the top, followed by module specific parameters *after*
that, in alphabetical order by module name.  i think that would make
far more sense.
