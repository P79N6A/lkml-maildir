No. Its not that severe, but it does exist, and it is noticable even
with a quarter that number of files. I did it because it was an
interesting illustrative example, and it only took 30 seconds or so of
coding to put the hash function into generator generating program.

Yup. It is probably a very unusual configuration, but that doesn't
mean that somebody won't experience it. :)
