The reason for the 10Gbps question was in most of the benchmarks I see 
10Gbps achieves roughly 250 MiB/s as others have reported on other mailing 
lists.
This company makes AoE / RAIDs (24 disks) quite cheap and they offer 
10Gbps on their units, has anyone done any independent benchmarking of 
their units?
They claim 550 MiB/s on them.
What type of RAID do they use for AoE?  Is it Linux SW Raid embedded in 
the unit?

What type of speeds are typical on 1Gbps vs. 10Gbps AoE connections?
Justin.
