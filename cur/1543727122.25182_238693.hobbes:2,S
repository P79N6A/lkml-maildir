Hello,
here some personel observations. Maybe they are result of little 
experience of mine. Maybe they are of use for others.
I use rev11 of it/ite8212 Dual Channel ATA RAID controller. On each 
master there is a 80GB harddisk.
When I set in the bios RAID 1 there comes an message similar
INVALID GEOMETRY: 0 PHYSICAL HEADS?
and booting stops.
When I set NORMAL, I get IRQ-timeouts for both disks. (IRQ 10)
but booting continous and I can use the disks.
hdparm => 15.70 MB/sec
