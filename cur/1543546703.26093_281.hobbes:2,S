Lucky you it has just crashed the machine for now: This is one of the many
ways available to permanently damage your motherboard. AFAIK, only serial
devices are safe to (un)plug with the machine turned on. Somebody killed a
(then very expensive) i386, a printer and the disks by plugging the (turned
on) printer to the (running) machine. The monitor survived, and that was
it.
