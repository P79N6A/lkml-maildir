We (Sequent, now bought by IBM) sold 64 processor servers to people 
who needed them (the main market was large databases) so, yes, there 
is definitely a market for larger systems. It's cheaper to build a big processor 
farm out of a Beowulf style cluster, but it's not always easy / possible to 
split up your application over something like that. If you're generating 
fractals, it's easy, for other applications, it's not.

I wish you good fortune, sir. When you've acheived that, come back and
tell me, and we'll stop testing stuff ;-) It's always better to not code bugs in
the first place, but that's not the world we live in ...

I'm all for encouraging good programming practices. In a way that's actually
harder in the diverse Linux community with hundreds, nay, thousands of
engineers putting code in. But we should still try - keeping the infrastructure
simple helps, for example. Trying to bug fix badly designed / written code is 
pissing into the wind.
