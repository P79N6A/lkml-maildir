I think you've got the timescales wrong.  Anything that we do now in gcc will
take a while to percolate to the Linux distributions.  It is far quicker for
those distributions to fix their kernels as fast as possible.  By the time any
gcc fix is in the world all of this will be over.
I suppose one could apply the precautionary principle, but those systems that
don't update kernels won't update gcc either, so the solution won't work.
Andrew.
