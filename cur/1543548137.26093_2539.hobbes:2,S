I'm doing an alternative patch that just igores unknown buses, because
paniccing is definitely the wrong answer for anything but some early
debugging ("did I catch all the relevant cases?").
It looks like the simplest solution is to just make bus number 0 be
"unknown", and leave it at that (and start ISA etc from 1).  Wouldn't you
agree?
I'd love to have somebody (yes, you) look at the actual MP table and see
if there is something special with the XXPRESS bus, but in the end even if
we don't know a bus we're better off always just mentioning the fact
("Unknown bus XXXX") and going on with our life. Maybe the system won't
work simply becasue we won't find any critical devices off the bus, but if
we panic we _know_ that it won't work, so..
