It's buried in Appendix F.

That's just for branches.
There are 32 condition register bits.
There are 9 values for the BO field. (so far)
There are 8 of these: bc,bca,bcl,bcla,bcctr,bcctrl,bclr,bclrl
That comes to 2304. Subtract the 456 "simplified"
instruction names you have. That leaves 1848 that
you are unable to access.
Take a look at the crand instruction. It uses numbers.
Now, just imagine mixing that with branch instructions
that hide the numbers. I hope you see the problem.

It doesn't appear to be so. He wrote:

So I'd like him to know that others like rlwinm directly too.
Using instructions that are in the index makes sense.
Using a zillion poorly documented alternatives is madness.
