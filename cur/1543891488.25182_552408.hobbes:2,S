Why? Not that I would really mind renaming one of these, but I don't see
a good reason for it. ieee80211_crypt_ccmp.c should not include
linux/raid/xor.h and the xor_block() in CCMP code is a static inline
function that should not show up outside the scope of this file. Do we
have some magic that makes exported symbols pollute name space for
inlined helper functions?
