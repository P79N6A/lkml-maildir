If I remember correctly, there are CPU's out there that will bomb out
horribly when you access %cr4 if the register doesn't exist.
Do I remember wrong?
I'd certainly agree with printing out cr4 even if it would be zero, I just
disagree very much with adding a register read to the dump output that may
cause an infinite regression of traps..
