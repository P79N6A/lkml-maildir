This is with your fifth patch on top of the previous four patches:
   
http://iucha.net/nfs/21-rc7-nfs3/big-copy
Again, it has memory, stack traces and rpc_debug.
The iostat 5 output:
   
http://iucha.net/nfs/21-rc7-nfs3/iostat
The netstat outputs are stable (not changed in 5 minutes):
   
http://iucha.net/nfs/21-rc7-nfs3/netstat-server
 :
tcp        1      0 hermes.iucha.org:nfs    zeus.iucha.org:799      CLOSE_WAIT 
tcp        0      0 hermes.iucha.org:nfs    zeus.iucha.org:976      ESTABLISHED
   
http://iucha.net/nfs/21-rc7-nfs3/netstat-client
Active Internet connections (w/o servers)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State      
tcp        0      0 zeus.iucha.org:976      hermes.iucha.org:nfs    ESTABLISHED
tcp        0      0 zeus.iucha.org:ssh      hermes.iucha.org:56880  ESTABLISHED
tcp        0      0 zeus.iucha.org:ssh      hermes.iucha.org:45176  ESTABLISHED
Could the port in CLOSE_WAIT state be the culprit?  (FWIW
the server has been up for 38 days and subjected to
this nfs test quite a bit without showing any stress).
