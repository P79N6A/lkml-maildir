Hi you all
i have a big problem with running my backup server with kernel 2.4.21 and a
raid1. Both, the scsi disks and the tape use the same scsi controller.
While i let the system rewind the tape, and if this command needs long
time, the scsi driver from kernel recogizes an error.
kernel: scsi : aborting command due to timeout.
kernel: SCSI disk error
kernel:  I/O error
kernel: raid1: Disk failure
kernel: ^IOperation continuing on 1 devices
kernel: md: updating md2 RAID superblock on device
kernel: md: recovery thread got woken up
kernel: md2: resyncing spare disk
kernel: RAID1 conf printout:
.
.
.
Is there a possibility to handle this problem, or do i have to install a
second scsi controller?
Thanks for any help.
Dirk
