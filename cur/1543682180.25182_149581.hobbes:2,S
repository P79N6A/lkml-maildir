           Summary: Nvidia Nforce2 interrupt handling problems
    Kernel Version: 2.6.0-test1
            Status: NEW
          Severity: normal
             Owner: greg@kroah.com
         Submitter: andy-kernel.388488@dustman.net
Distribution: Gentoo
Hardware Environment: Athlon-XP, Nvidia Nforce2 chipset, Radeon 8500 (r200) AGP,
3com 3c920
Software Environment:
AWARD BIOS
gcc version 3.2.3 20030422 (Gentoo Linux 1.4 3.2.3-r1, propolice)
GNU ld version 2.14.90.0.2 20030515 <-- binutils
XFree-4.3.0
Problem Description:
PCI interrupt assignments get weird. With certain boot parameters, you can get
from mostly non-functional to mostly functional. dmesg from several combinations
of parmeters will be attached, but in a nutshell, with local APIC and IO-APIC 
and ACPI enabled in the kernel, a lot of strange things happen, even if you use
noapic and pci=noacpi. Disabling the APIC helps a little, but to be functional
at all, pci=noacpi must be used.
Steps to reproduce:
Will be detailed in the following attachments.
