If you compile with debugging on you can always run your program in
gdb.  On a good day gdb will show you where the SIGSEGV is when it
happens.  Unfortunately, gdb is not 100% bug free when debugging
multithreaded stuff, but it works well enough most of the time.  
IIRC you need at least verion 4.18 of gdb for multithreaded debugging to
work.
