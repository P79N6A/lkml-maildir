Subject: [-mm patch] DEBUG_SHIRQ should depend on DEBUG_KERNEL
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

DEBUG_SHIRQ is clearly a debugging option.
While moving the option below DEBUG_KERNEL, I also adjusted the help 
text to be completely visible in "make menuconfig" with a 80 char
width.
