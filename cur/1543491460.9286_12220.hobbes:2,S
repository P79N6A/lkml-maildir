If you do this with the Debian distribution you're toast.
The Debian libc-dev packages includes /usr/include/{linux,asm,scsi}
already. If you remove those and replace it by links you have
broken both the packaging system and your development environment.
If you need to compile something with the _kernel_ headers, just
include -I/usr/src/linux/include. But no sane program should
ever need to include <linux/....>

Ofcourse they are. And for a reason. You are not supposed to replace
or overwrite them. There is a _reason_ these instructions got removed
from the kernel README.

You're breaking everything in sight here. Bad, bad advice.
