Yes.  DMI_MATCH() specifies substring matching, so _if we knew_
that any BIOS version that began with "1SET4", "1SET5", "1SET6",
or "1SET7" needed C-state limiting, the table could be made a lot
smaller.  But then it may need some exceptions, so just sticking
with full version strings seems reasonable to me.
