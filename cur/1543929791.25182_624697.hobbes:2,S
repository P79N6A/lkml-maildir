I don't think we can increase PNP_MAX_PORT to 128.  Only one or two
devices need that many, so just bumping the max wastes a LOT of space.
A struct resource is seven longs, so on a 32-bit system with sixteen
PNP devices, we'd be wasting (128-24)*7*4*16 = almost 47Kbytes.
In hindsight, I should not have removed drivers/acpi/motherboard.c
until we had dynamic PNP resource tables.  We could revert that
change [1], but the driver's been gone since 2.6.21, so I don't
think it's that urgent.  It's just that we used to silently ignore
resources past the limits, and in -mm, we now print a KERN_ERR message.
So I think we should either remove the message altogether (so we're
exactly like 2.6.23 in this regard), or at least tone it down to
a KERN_WARN or something.
And we need to get Thomas' dynamic patch into -mm ASAP :-)
