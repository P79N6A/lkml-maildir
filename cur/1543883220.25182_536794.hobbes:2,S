No, it isn't a problem in the USB core.  The device itself is messed up; 
it really does report idVendor and idProduct both equal to 0.
Jiri, don't worry about all those other devices in the listing that also 
have idVendor and idProduct set to 0.  They aren't real devices at all; 
they are virtual root hubs.  You'll see what I mean if you look at their 
iManufacturer, iProduct, and iSerial strings.
