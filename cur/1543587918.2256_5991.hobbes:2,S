If it doesn't matter on i386 why bother?

IIRC certain key structures cannot be taken to gcc's style of struct
initialization, and IIRC this is one of them.  Maybe that's a egcs-1.1.2
bug.  Have you looked at the assembly output to make sure things are
100% ok after this change?

Jeff, who wonders if there is a way to upgrade human memory as easily as
computer memory...
