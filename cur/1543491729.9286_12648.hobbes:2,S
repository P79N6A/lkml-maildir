Recently someone complained that changes made in fdisk
didn't `take', that he deleted a partition, and rebooted,
and it was still there. I could hardly believe this -
there is no such bug in fdisk - and he reported that
another attempt with cfdisk had been successful.
A moment ago I used cfdisk on some machine and found
the partition table unchanged after writing it back.
And sync;sync;sync did not change that.
But a second invocation of cfdisk worked.
This was a vanilla 2.2.3 kernel.
So, maybe a bug has crept into the treatment of partition
table sectors in 2.2.*. Will investigate more later.
