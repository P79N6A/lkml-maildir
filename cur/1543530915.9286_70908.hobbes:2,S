The point is that noone needs the 'check' case, because the checks
don't check anything vital, and only take a lot of time. So many
clueless people wait much longer than they'd need to.
The check isn't necessary, because the 'clean' flag is still there and
if your system crashes, e2fsck will do the checking job. No need to
check the counts on every mount.
