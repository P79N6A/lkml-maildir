Well, not really; ioctl() is only one system call. They're actually
avoided because ioctl() has a horrible non-typesafe non-transparent
interface. (Quick! What parameters does the CCISS_PASSTHRU32 ioctl()
expect?)
sysfs fixes all of these problems, and adds easy scriptability
and interrogation from the command-line and a nice hierarchy
as well.
New *system calls* are generally avoided (especially if they might be
useful to non-privileged code) because they come with a *very* high
backward compatibility burden: it's pretty much the case that syscalls
that normal programs rely on should never go away. (Syscalls used only
by programs that you expect to change with the kernel, like modutils/
module-init-tools, are a special case.)
