the problem is that 10 msec might be fine for a 9MB L2 cache CPU running a
DB benchmark, but it will sure be too much of a migration cutoff for other
boxes. And too much of a migration cutoff means increased idle time -
resulting in CPU-under-utilization and worse performance.
so i'd prefer to not touch it for 2.6.9 (consider that tree closed from a
scheduler POV), and we can do the auto-tuning in 2.6.10 just fine. It will
need the same weeks-long testcycle that all scheduler balancing patches
need. There are so many different type of workloads ...

iirc it was tweaked as a result of the other bug that you fixed. But, high
sensitivity to this tunable was nevery truly established, and a 9 MB L2
cache CPU is certainly not typical - and it is certainly the one that
hurts most from migration effects.
anyway, we were running based on cache_decay_ticks for a long time - is
that what was 10 msec on your box? The cache_decay_ticks calculation was
pretty fine too, it scaled up with cachesize.
