true ... three ideas:
- a sort of temporary priority elevation (the opposite of SCHED_YIELD)
  as long as the process holds some lock
- automatically schedule the task, if some higher-priorized task wants
  the lock
- preventing the processes from aquiring locks at all (obviously this
  is not possible for required locks inside the kernel, but i don't
  know enough about this)

did "these" apply only to the tasks, that actually hold a lock?
if not, then i don't like this idea, as it gives the processes
time for the only reason, that it _might_ hold a lock. this basically 
undermines the idea of static classes. in this case, we could actually
just make the "nice" scale incredibly large and possibly nonlinear, 
as mark suggested.
