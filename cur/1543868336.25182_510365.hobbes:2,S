lspci and interrupts at the bottom. yes, we have apic.

The EN12000 is equipped with a PCI riser like the one here:
http://www.tranquilpc-shop.co.uk/acatalog/info
%5f2%2ehtml
Please also see
http://www.tranquilpc-shop.co.uk/acatalog/PCI_Risers.html
 and

%20Riser.pdf
for info about how the riser works.

Ah, this sounds interesting.
Any pointers about hwo to do this?

I will give the change a try.
