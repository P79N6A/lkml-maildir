That one is gone. wa@almesberger.net should work for the
forseeable future.

The initrd is typically loaded below 16 MB. Your bzImage
uncompresses after the loaded kernel, so if your kernel is, say,
3 MB and compresses to 1 MB (that's a reasonably lean 2.4.19 kernel),
up to about 4.5 MB are overwritten already when getting the kernel
in place. A 6 MB/2 MB kernel would happy scribble over ~8.5 MB.

The 8 MB mapping affects mainly the maximum kernel size and
shouldn't matter in this case. If you want to try anyway, you
should be able to increase the mapping by pushing
arch/i386/kernel/head.S:empty_zero_page down by a page, and
adjusting the .org below too.
So, assuming the problem is indeed the kernel overwriting initrd,
there are three things you can do to avoid this:
 - use a smaller initrd (they were never meant to be quite
   *that* big anyway :-)
 - make your kernel smaller
 - get your boot loader to load the initrd at a higher
   address, or find a boot loader that does (no, I don't
   know which ones do, and whether they do this reliably.
   Section 2.5 of my booting paper (see above) explains
   some potential pitfalls.)
