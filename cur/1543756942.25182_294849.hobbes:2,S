Please stop this offensive posting style unless you have a hard, really
hard proof. Of course Larry and his company want to make money (you know
the term open secret?), and they'd better not disappoint those who've
trusted in BK/Free; but if he asked to veil his intentions or out of
honest interest in consultations can only be judged after we've seen the
3.2.4 BK/Free license.
