From my tests, since NBD doesn't have a timeout option, MD hangs in the
write to that mirror indefinitely, somewhat like when dealing with a
broken IDE driver/chipset/disk.

MD has the write-mostly/write-behind options - which help in this case
but only up to a certain amount.
In my experience DRBD wins hands-down over MD+NBD because of MD doesn't
know (or handle) a component that never returns from a write, which is
quite different from returning with an error. Furthermore, DRBD was
designed to handle transient errors in the connection to the peer due to
its network-oriented design, whereas MD is mostly designed with local or
at least high-reliability disks (where disk can be SAN, SCSI, etc.) and
a failure is not normal for MD. Thus the need for manual reconnect in MD
case and the automated handling of reconnects in case of DRBD.
I'm just a happy user of both MD over local disks and DRBD for networked
raid.
