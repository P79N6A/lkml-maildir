I would suggest waiting on problem reports for that one a bit longer.
Maybe it fixes everything, and has no downsides. But the problem it fixed 
isn't new, and the order change certainly has the _potential_ to be scary.
Do we have reports of that one fixing a lot of machines? I know of only 
one person it made a difference for..
