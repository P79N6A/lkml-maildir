That is one of the "features" that I hate most about Windows. All you really do 
is move the delays around. For instance, my Windows machine at work is joined 
to a domain and has the Novell NetWare client installed for NDS auth (don't 
ask) so when the GINA comes up, I hit Ctrl+Alt+Del, enter my password and wait 
staring at an hourglass while the GINA waits for network connectivity to come 
up so that it can authenticate me. And even if authentication was local and I 
got logged in right away, chances are good that I have mapped drives or 
printers on the network that I will have to wait for during the login process 
anyway.
I agree boot up is too slow and that some things should be started in the 
background, but not things that are required for the main purpose of the box to 
work properly, what should be started sync and what should be async is a hard 
decision IMO. Right now I use swsusp2 to work around this, it takes less time 
to resume my session + 500M of file cache than it does to boot manually and 
start all of my apps back up, but obviously that's not a real solution.
