Why?  A module is either being used or it isn't, the number of uses
shouldn't even come into it.

No, the number of current users wouldn't have any bearing on it whatsoever.
How each module does it would be up to the module itself.  For an ethernet
card it could be while the card is associated with a IP; for a USB keyboard
it could be while the keyboard is plugged in; for a sound driver it could
be while anything is accessing the sound devices. etc etc.
I'm suggesting that the responsibility for determining when it is safe
to unload a particular module should lay with the module itself and
not with the kernel.

Possibly a poor choice of words on my part.  What I meant was that
once the functionality goes into the kernel testing will happen on
every single Linux box in the land that has this future kernel.  Some
of those users will report bugs if there are any.  And some of those
users may even help to fix those bugs.
Also what I meant is that you can't test something that doesn't
exist.

There are an awful lot of users out there who would disagree with you
on that.  _One_ of the reasons that I believe that this moon is worth
barking at is:
If a module should never, in the normal course of events, be unloaded,
then there isn't _any_ point to being able to load them in the first
place.  Not being able to unload them _totally_ defeats the purpose of
modules.
Yes, I could be wrong, I sure as anything don't know the full story,
but I'm not convinced that I am wrong yet.

Several extremely bright people thought Galileo was a heretic and a
fool. 
Tell me that this problem is _impossible_ to solve and providing you
can show me _why_ it is impossible I'll speak no more on this
matter.
But if you tell me that this problem is too hard to solve, then I have
no alternative than to think: "you're not trying hard enough".
