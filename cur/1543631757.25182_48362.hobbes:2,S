The RTAI current release COPYING says that it is LGPL, not GPL.  OK,
now go read the source.  There is absolutely *zero* doubt in my mind that
that code is derived from the RTLinux source tree.  And I'd be happy to
be called as an expert witness in court and walk the court through the
diffs, there is no way anyone would disagree.
And in spite of the RTAI guys changing lots of stuff, the source base in
which they were working was GPLed.  In order for them to change the license,
they have to prove that it was not a derived work.  Let's see, it's the
trying to solve the same problem, it started with the same source base,
you can still look at it and see that it was the same source base, and
you think they'll wiggle out of a derived work restriction?  Not a chance.
