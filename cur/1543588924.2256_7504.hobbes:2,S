Pavel,
We already have lid support in the latest ACPI versions (not in the official
kernel yet.) You can download this code from
http://developer.intel.com/technology/iapc/acpi/downloads.htm
 .
It'd be great if you could focus your testing and patches on this code base
-- I think it's a lot better but it's still a work in progress.
Regards -- Andy
PS I'm not quite sure why you copied the acpi list *and* lkml.. ;-)
