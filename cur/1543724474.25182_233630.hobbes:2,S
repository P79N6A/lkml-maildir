I have a simliar issue with the trindentfb, Is anyone maintaining the
trindentfb, so I can work them to resolve this issue???
The trindentfb does respond to the setting of the refresh rate properly. I
have an omnibook XE2, with the cyberblade i/7 video. I need to setup the
trindentfb to 800x600 with a Horizonatal sync of 35.15 and a fresh rate
between 55-65.
These are the settings required for X trident driver also.
Problem has been in all 2.6.x kernels, Just seeing Ralf's message remindend
me. vesafb works.
