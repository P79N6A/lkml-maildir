Curious.  If anything, I'd expect it to say
"pcimodules is scanning more than 00:00.0".
(The last version I saw didn't have a way to
scan for modules appropriate to a particular
PCI slot, and the hotplug scripts warn about
that limitation.)
You might try renaming "pcimodules" to "pcimodules-"
to see if that changes any interesting behavior.  I notice
you're using RedHat with 7.1 and usb-uhci.  I seem to
recall that Kudzu wanted to do some hotplug-ish things;
they may not play well together yet.
