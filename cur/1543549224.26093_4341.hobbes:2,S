Well, I read syslog a lot at home and servers, but customer on-site
production computer deep reconfiguration ,
there is another paradigm - it either works 100% or I dont care.
Looks from general talk here, that some kernel people should try
servicing some customers on-site with house full  of people waiting
their stable results within 24 hours and their ass being kicked if they
do not succeed.

It is a bit more generic. Just to get an automatic warning for each module
which is marked experimental, so that I could rely on that, so I dont need to
dig back 100 versions of source code.
Another idea: experimental bit. Kernel would have two  bits: non-production and
experimental. Whenever such a subsystem is activated, those bits remain on until
reboot.
