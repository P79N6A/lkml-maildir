Julio,
	No one is trying to paper over any real problem here. This attack relies on 
being able to insert an arbitrary kernel module into the running kernel. If 
you can do that, you can literally load _any_ code you want. Attaching to the 
binfmt callback list is one of about a billion things you could do.
	If you're worried about this kind of attack, the only way to be safe is to 
turn off kernel module support or use another mechanism to restrict who can 
load them.
	I think it's a little bit silly for a "security researcher" to simultaneously 
publish stuff in the news and in a developer community, especially if the 
threat is totally phony to begin with.
