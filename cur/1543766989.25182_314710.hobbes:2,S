Sorry, that's not right. At that point, gprs[2] holds the syscall number, while the
first argument of the syscall is in origgpr2. If the debugger sets the syscall number
to -1, which is an invalid syscall, changing trap to -1 will result in a changed
behavior only in case, that the debugger on the second syscall interception also sets
the syscall result to ERESTARTXXXXX (This again is modifying gprs[2]). ERESTARTXXXXX
normally would/could be handled by do_signal(), but with the patch it no longer will.
So, I think the patch doesn't hurt in normal cases, but does the trick for UML.

Let my explain a bit more. UML invalidates UML-user's syscalls on the host, processes
the syscall itself and inserts the result into gprs[2] on the second syscall
interception. For nearly all syscalls ERESTARTXXXXX is a result not returned to user,
but handled in UML kernel internally. But that's not true for sys_(rt_)sigreturn.
The "result" of those is the original contents of gpr2 of the interrupted routine,
which accidentally also might be ERESTARTXXXXXXX (BTW, that's the reason for
sys_(rt_)sigreturn setting trap to -1 also). We skip UML's syscall restart handling
in this case, but we need to skip it in the host, too.
