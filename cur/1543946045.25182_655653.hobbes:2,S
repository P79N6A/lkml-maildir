Subject: sysdev: detecting multiple driver registrations

I've just found how easy it is to accidentally register
a sysdev_driver for two different classes. When this
happens, bad things happen as the sysdev_driver structure
keeps has the list entry for the driver registration.
The following patch makes a WARN_ON() if this happens,
although I think BUG_ON or returning -EAGAIN could also be valid
responses to this.

My first question is, whether people think that this check
is a sane and worthwhile thing to do.
The second question is, should this be BUG_ON, WARN_ON or
return an error (with optional print)?
And my third question is that a number of drivers are
assuming an NULL initialised 'struct list_head' is a
valid setup for an include/linux/list.h list. Is
there a case of using LIST_HEAD_INIT() on all sysdev
driver structures? If not, should we be using
INIT_LIST_HEAD() in sysdev_driver_register(). The header
is not clear on what should be done.
