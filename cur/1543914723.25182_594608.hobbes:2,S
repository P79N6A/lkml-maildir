i wonder if assigning a real time priority with
pthread_setschedparam() to the caller of your interrupt_handler()
function would solve your problem. this way the main() thread is never
scheduled when the interrupt_handler() thread is
runnable. interrupt_handler() should be as short as possible,
otherwise you risk starving of the rest of your systems processes.
