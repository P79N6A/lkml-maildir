That wasn't so hard.

We have one single (known) caller in the whole kernel.  This is not
worth adding another great pile of kernel threads for!

Am still awaiting an understandable description of this alleged bug :(
If someone can be persuaded to cough up this information (which should
have been in the changelog from day #1) then perhaps someone will be
able to think of a more pleasing fix.  That's one of the reasons for
writing changelogs.
