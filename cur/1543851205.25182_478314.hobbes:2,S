Subject: [PATCH 28/61] md: Fix bug where spares dont always get rebuilt properly when they become live.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
From: NeilBrown <neilb@suse.de>
If save_raid_disk is >= 0, then the device could be a device that is 
already in sync that is being re-added.  So we need to default this
value to -1.
