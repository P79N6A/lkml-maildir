Subject: poor disk performance : HPT372 on Abit KD7-RAID, 2.4.22-pre10-ac1

Hello!
I'm experimenting with an Abit kd7-raid motherboard. One Maxtor 6Y080L0
HDD connected to each HPT372 channel. Disk performance is poor: md
synchronisation works with only 1500-1800kB/sec (raid level 1). When the
drives are connected to the VIA IDE channels, synchronisation works with
10MB/sec, as the default /proc/sys/dev/raid/speed_limit_max. (I want to
use an IDE CD-writer, so I have to connect the drives to the HPT
controller.)
Any advice, how to speed up the drives?
Additional information:
kernel is 2.4.22-pre10-ac1
HPT372 BIOS was upgraded to the latest version (2.34)
hdparm, cat /proc/ide/hpt366 reports, that the drives are working in UDMA
 mode (udma6), cable is ATA-66
lspci -n reports 1103:0004 (rev05)
I'm using an HPT374 controller in an another machine without problems.
