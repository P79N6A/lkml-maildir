You're welcome. Until 2.6.20 or .21 s2ram never worked for me and even then 
sound did not work after resume. Now it seems to be supported perfectly, so

Pity this laptop is slowly nearing end of life (3.5 years old, though still 
performing fine).

Yes, my mistake. For E) /sys/power/state only has "disk", not "mem".

Great. That was what I was thinking. Thanks for confirming.
