I'm constantly getting lost in the maze of rules, on what exactly
happens on setuid() etc, but I know that setuid() resets the
capabilities as well.  What's the way of changing euid and suid back
to ruid, and yet keeping some capabilities?

If process A accesses a filesystem controlled by process B, then B
gets ptrace-like ability over A.
Controlling a filesystem means, that a userspace process provides the
data/metadata for the filesystem as requested by the kernel.  It could
be a v9fs, FUSE, or NFS served by a userspace entity.
So what exactly can B do with A?
  - Know the exact sequence and timing of file operations being
    performed.  This is an information leak, though without serious
    consequences in most cases
  - Provide arbitrary data/metadata.  Extremely large files, extremly
    deep directories, etc.  This can lead to DoS, by forcing a more
    privileged program to process/store more data, than the user could
    possibly provide otherwise (because of quota, or simply filesystem
    size limits).
  - Determine the time it takes for each filesystem operation.  This
    is the most serious problem, as delaying an operation will result
    in hanging of the requester, possibly causing other hanging
    resources (e.g. file locks).
For more detailed analysis of the problem see
Documentation/filesystems/fuse.txt in -mm.

No.  That assumption can easily be satisfied, by limiting where the
user can mount.  If mounting is only allowed on files/directories that
the user has unlimited write capability, than it cannot modify files
directories that the privileged process has assumptions about.
For example, in a private namespace, it's perfectly safe to allow bind
mounts (without any restrictions about which processes can access it)
on user writable files/directories.

Yes, it's about ptrace-like privilege borrowing and not about set-uid.
And as such, it probably needs the capability fix that you propose for
ptrace as well.
