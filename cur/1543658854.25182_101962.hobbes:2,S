Thanks, I was thinking along the same lines after
discovering that a lot of other modules had the same problem...:-)
After a mrproper everything is working OK now.
But just to get a complete picture, does it mean that
a) a kernel build for a VIA C3 doesn't use MMX, userspace programs can
still use it
or
b) Both kernel and userspace can't use MMX any more
If option b) would be true a lot of people who are using the VIA Eden
platform to view Divx and other multimedia material will be probably be
hurt performance wise. If the MMX implementation on the C3 is any good.
Greetings,
Jurgen
