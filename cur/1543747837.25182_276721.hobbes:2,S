Hello,
I commented out the line recompiled but still same problem.
I couldn't apply the patch because whenever I tried I got :
patch -p0 < rtl 
patching file drivers/net/r8169.c
Hunk #1 FAILED at 1161.
1 out of 1 hunk FAILED -- saving rejects to file drivers/net/r8169.c.rej
A dump of r8169.c.rej :
***************
*** 1161,1167 ****
  static inline void rtl8169_make_unusable_by_asic(struct RxDesc *desc)  {
-       desc->addr = 0x0badbadbadbadbad;
        desc->status &= ~cpu_to_le32(OWNbit | RsvdMask);  }
--- 1161,1167 ----
  static inline void rtl8169_make_unusable_by_asic(struct RxDesc *desc)  {
+       desc->addr = 0x0badbadbadbadbadull;
        desc->status &= ~cpu_to_le32(OWNbit | RsvdMask);  }
I tried to apply the patch both in the older version and in the new one but
nothing.
And yeah values greater than 1500 would improve openmosix a lot a believe.
Thank you for your time,
Regards,
Nicholas Papadakos
