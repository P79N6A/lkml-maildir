I don't know whether that is the case. The two issues are related -- the
IO is be done zero-copy because there is no cache involved, and due to
there being no cache, there are alignment restrictions.
I think IRIX might have implemented O_DIRECT first, and although the
semantics are a bit vague, I think it has always been to do zero copy
IO _and_ to bypass cache (ie. no splice-like tricks).

It is because they already do their own caching, so going through
another, dumber, cache of same or less size (the pagecache) is useless.
fadvise does not change that.
That said, tmpfs's page are not really a cache (except when they are
swapcache, but let's not complicate things). So O_DIRECT on tmpfs
may not exactly be wrong.
