I suppose... provide three modules maybe: (1) the object and handle support
mechanism; (2) the Win32 API (what of it I decide to implement in a kernel
module) and syscall; and (3) the Native API and interrupt.

Agreed.

Also agreed, particularly when GDI calls are considered. Though this also
applies to the Native API.
