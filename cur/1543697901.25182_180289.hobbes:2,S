Ok, good point. my first reaction is to make copy refuse to function
unless the target doesn't exist (protect the output), but that doesn't
solve the problem of protecting the input or preventing someone else from
tampering with the output (unless you have copy return the FD to use to
access the output)
actually thinking about it a bit more, did I make a stupid mistake and
think that the FD points at the beginning of the file when it really
points at the inode? if it points at the inode then the problems I was
refering to don't exist.
