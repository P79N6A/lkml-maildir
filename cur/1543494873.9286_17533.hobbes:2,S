Yes this is true.  Source addresses are always individual addresses so
the individual/group bit used in the destination address is instead 
used to indicate source routing information in the source address.
Other magic bits do exist:-
In a destination address bit 6 (mask 0x40) of the first byte indicates
a locally administered address (if 1).
Also if both bit 7 and bit 6 are set (destination address starts with 0xC0)
then bit 7 of the second address byte indicates whether the address is
a group (1) or functional address (0).

I'll look into this when I get time.
Thanks for the response.
