Apart from the argument already given on other replies, you should
keep in mind that you probably need to give priority to doing receive.
THat include your clients, but if you don't you run into the risk of
significantly limiting your bandwidth since the send queues around your
system fill up. 
Try doing that with threads. 
Actually I would recommend the approach c)
c)  Write an asynchronous system with only 2 or three threads where I
manage the connections and keep the state of each connection in a data
structure.
