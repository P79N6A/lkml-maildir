I admire your ability to see problems so fast.
Could you please look at my patch that I posted many times (attached
again)?  It's much simpler than the one by Daniel.
First of all, it removes the old attempts to fix the TI issue.  You can
always leave them intact if you want.
The fixup is applied is following conditions are met:
1) The card is a ti12xx or newer.  If older cards need any fixups, they
are going to be different.  Such cards don't have irqmux.
2) No ISA interrupts were detected.  That is, we are not breaking working
systems with ISA or serial ISA interrupts.
3) irqmux (the 32 bit value) is 0.  This value is not compatible with
working PCI interrupts.  Also, being 0 is a sign that irqmux wasn't
initialized from EEPROM.
Those conditions, if implemented properly (I hope so) mean that we are not
breaking existing functionality.
My testing shows that this patch fixes interrupts on certain TI PCI1410
cards with one slot.  I believe they have EEPROM but cannot be programmed.
I actually tried that and I can describe my attempts in more details in a
separate thread.
I also have a two-slot TI PCI1221 card, but it has proper irqmux and
doesn't need any fixups.
If any two-slot TI card needs to be supported, it can be done.  Most
likely this patch will set up interrupts at least for one of the slots,
which is good already.  I don't trust my skills to code from specs without
testing, so it's quite deliberate that the code makes no attempts to
support the second slot.  I can do it using the pcmcia-cs i82365 driver as
the starting point.
Please let me know what I can do make the kernel support TI PCI1410
bridges.  I have a lot of them on many systems, and it's quite an
annoyance to patch the kernel every time for each of those systems.  I'm
ready to put efforts into fixing this problem permanently.
