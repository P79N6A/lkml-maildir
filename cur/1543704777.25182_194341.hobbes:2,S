In 2.6.1 I could use framebuffer through vesafb just with that parameter
(vga=795, ie. 1280x10224 16M).
In 2.6.2-rc* it does not work for me, just blank screen if I try to use
vesafb.
Zack Winkles pointed me that I could try passing
video=vesafb:ywrap,pmipal,mtrr,vga=795 to get vesafb working.
Thanks for it. Right now I'm on travel and I can not try it, I will be
able to do so on thursday.

I did not try 2.6.0 with that radeon 9200 (I didn't have it then).
vesafb stopped working for me in 2.6.2-rc1.

You can see it in Documentation/fb/vesafb.txt (that file has the numbers
in hexadecimal, and kernel wants the boot parameter in decimal, just
convert it).
Althoug, I would prefer to use radeonfb instead of vesafb (radeonfb
turns off my monitor and vesafb does not).
Anyone with a Radeon 9200 does use radeonfb ? If yes, any special boot
parameter?
