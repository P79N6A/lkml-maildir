I did not have the pointer to Doug's latest version of the i810
driver.  I will integrate my patches into his latest version and will
send it to the list.  I will also have another look at recording but
it would be great if you could be a little bit more specific of your
recording results.
What happened? 
  How did you try to record?
  Did the system crash?  
  Did the program you used for recording crash?
  Was the recording trash?  
  How did it sound?  To fast? To slow? Crackling? Random noise? All of it?
  What hardware do you have?  K7S5A or a different MB with a SiS735 chipset? 
Thanks,
Thomas
