You're changing the API anyway, so just get rid of the declaration from futex.h
(that doesn't actually make for an export anyway, unless it is inline).
But... that isn't there in mainline. Why is it in -mm? At any rate, that makes
it a no brainer to change.

Well we _control_ the API, so let's make it as clean and performant as possible
from the start.
