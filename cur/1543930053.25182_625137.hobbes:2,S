Hm, no good idea, but some possible hints:
1. Ask Gentoo folks - if anyone has seen similar problems
2. RAM test - even if earlier kernels ran stable, the new one might stress 
your RAM differently
3. Are you sure nothing else has changed apart from the kernel?
4. You might try to recompile a vanilla 2.6.23+ kernel and enable as many 
kernel debugging options as you can...
5. Are you sure the installed kernel matches your CPU and your user-space 
64- / 32-bit combination? Don't know whether a wrongly configured kernel 
could cause such problems though
Good luck
