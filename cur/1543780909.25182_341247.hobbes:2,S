int is a call to either an interrupt or exception procedure. 0x80 is
setup in Linux to be a trap and not an interrupt vector. So it does
_not_ turn off interrupts.
I'm looking at the sysenter code which is suppose to be the fast entry
into the system, and it looks like it is suppose to call the
sysenter_entry when used.  I'm trying to write something to test this
out, since I still have the ud2 op in my sysentry code. So if I do get
this to work, I can cause a bug.
