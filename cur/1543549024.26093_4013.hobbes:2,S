Rik could you tell me where I said anything about the new VM in test9?
I _very_ much hope the 2.4.0-test9-pre2 VM is much better than
2.4.0-test1-ac22-class++ otherwise it can't explain why your code is been
integrated and my classzone thing is only been complained by you and Linus.
I asked you if you known that ac22-class++ was faster under low mem because
from your previous question ended with the smile you looked to assume that
nobody can do anything better than the current VM. If my assumption was wrong I
apolgise, however you should explain me the reason of the smile then.
If my assumption was right, I given you the proof you shouldn't assume that.
