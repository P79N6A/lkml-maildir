To make it completely clear, a lot of my "fix warning" patches are
derived from the ARM Linux kernel autobuilder, which can be found
at 
http://armlinux.simtec.co.uk/kautobuild/
and I only really look at the latest builds on there.

It seems that ({0;}) is used when something is expected to return zero.
However, if it is used in a void context, gcc 4 generates an annoying
warning.

Depends if you end up with "blah is unused" warnings instead.  It's
all round _far_ safer to use the inline function method from that
point of view.
Not that I particularly care, I just wanted to squash some of the
rediculous number of warnings in the kernel and decided to hit the
easy ones.  However, they're turning out to be real pigs instead. 8(
