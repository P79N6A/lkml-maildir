Considering that about 100% of the sound drivers do not follow that
particular API damage anyway (they can't, as has been pointed out: the
driver doesn't even receive enough information to be _able_ to follow the 
documented API), I doubt that there are all that many programs that depend
on it.
Yes, some drivers apparently _try_ to follow the spec to some degree, but
we should just change the documentation asap.
