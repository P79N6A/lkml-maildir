Manu,
to me it looks like your  attitude is not acceptable here, I sent
several mails already which you just use to ignore.
If you don't change that attitude immediatelly I'd really wish to get
you banned of this community until you're open for discussions.

there's a bugreport and you fully ignore it, and you blame it on the
"politicians" here, telling me that there are mails out there
somewhere shows that you're not interested in getting forward.
I'm waiting for your response here.
