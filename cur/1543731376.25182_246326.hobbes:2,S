Just a tiny little detail that might be interesting to anyone
forming an opinion on all the pwc/linux stuff:
	-----------------------------------------------------------
	The author of the pwc driver has publicly stated that this
	NDA has expired more than 1 year ago !!!
	-----------------------------------------------------------
Despite this he refuses to release the source code for the binary-only
driver.  Of course it is his right to do so: it is his code.
But I think it is important for everyone to know this fact.
	greetings,
