Status update:
uptime:
 12:45pm  up 2 days 19:39,  18 users,  load average: 2.02, 2.05, 2.06
Running SMP. So far no crash happened under ext3. 
Still I see the tar-verification errors. None on the first day, 2 on the second
and 2 today so far.
I see a growing possibility that the formerly crashes are directly linked to a
reiserfs problem, maybe broken SMP-locking.
If it survives until sunday I will revert all ext3 back to reiserfs to be sure
it still crashes, then ideas for patches will be welcome :-)
Up to sunday I can try to look deeper into the verification troubles. To be
honest I already doubt today that I will see a crash with ext3 until sunday...
Regards,
Stephan
