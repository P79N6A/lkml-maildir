Don't forget to include libc.so here -- you know libstdc++ won't run
without it.  Let's see ... Debian-unstable glibc 2.1.95 here ...
-rwxr-xr-x    1 root     root      1057576 Oct 13 13:45 /lib/libc.so.6
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root      2445036 Oct 13 13:47 /usr/lib/libc.a
Heh.

Is this similar to the gcc 'const' attribute?
  int foo (int, char *) __attribute__((__const__));
This is valid in GNU C (not just C++).  Read the info page for
details.  As to the pass-by-reference operator, that's just syntactic
sugar and IMHO the information-hiding makes more trouble than it's
worth (I want to *know* I'm passing by reference!).
