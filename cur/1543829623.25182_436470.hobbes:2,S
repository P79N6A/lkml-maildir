It's always a bug on x86.
Signal handlers will overwrite the stack, so if you use the stack before 
decrementing the stack pointer, you're fundamentally screwed.
The "enter" (and "pusha" etc) instructions are special and magical, 
because they _will_ decrement the stack pointer atomically if they 
succeed.

We always have. It's the x86 ABI.
The x86-64 ABI has a 128-byte(*) zone that is safe from signals etc, so 
you can use a small amount of stack below the stackpointer safely. Not so 
on x86.

(*) That "128 byte" is from memory. Maybe it's bigger.
