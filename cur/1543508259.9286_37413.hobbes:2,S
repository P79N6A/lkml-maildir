	Hello,
	Since 2.3.15 (the first 2.3.6+ kernel I was able to boot) the CDROM
driver is giving very strange problems, it seems that trying to open a 
Audio CDROM will fail, and mtv (an mpeg player) is unable to play VCD 
cds. Some programs like cdtool will fail also.
	Does this mean that there have been uncompatible changes to the 
CDROM driver? If that is true lot of non-free applications will be 
broken, and I think that this is not the correct way to do things, I 
really prefer free software, but not everything may be free. Just hope the
problems with CDROM driver will get fixed before 2.4 (and also hope devfs
gets finally into the kernel before 2.4).
	Regards
	- german
