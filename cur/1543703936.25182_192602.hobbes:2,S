Well, I had C version that was working (and it was slightly easier to
code it in C), and really did not want to introduce errors at that
point.

Sorry, I missed that one.

Unfortunately the copy loop has quite complicated interface. It
expects tables already loaded into memory, at non-conflicting
addresses etc.

We need to do something with those 1,3s and 4s. IIRC there's no such
thing as D4 (or is it expected to be == D3cold?). This needs to be
documented somewhere.

My fault, the patch is in my tree only. (Its here for quite a long
time. I synced it to Patrick and then he disappeared.).

Yes, that's right solution. Here's the patch.
