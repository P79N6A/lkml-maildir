Thanks for the information, it should help my work on read-ahead.
I noticed similar problem when testing read-ahead behavior for fs-on-loop.
The basic conclusion is read-ahead in the block device level can
complement file level read-ahead, for the latter does not do inter-file
read-ahead.  But it has to be limited/conservative, because the risk of
cache miss is much higher.

Sorry, I'm new to CLOCK-Pro, too...
