Subject: [PATCH 10/11] NFSD: Remove redundant "select" clauses in fs/Kconfig
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

As far as I can tell, selecting the CRYPTO and CRYPTO_MD5 entries under
CONFIG_NFSD is redundant, since CONFIG_NFSD_V4 already selects
RPCSEC_GSS_KRB5, which selects these entries.
Testing with "make menuconfig" shows that the entries under CRYPTO still
properly reflect "Y" or "M" based on the setting of CONFIG_NFSD after this
change is applied.
