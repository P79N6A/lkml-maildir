Point taken; the point remains is that you need at least several
(intentionally or not) cooperating processes. The chances of this are
significantly lower than a single process exploit.

True. It'd appear that if you want that, you'd specify the AA profile so
that it doesn't include directories/files writable by untrusted
processes.

Oh, you're saying that this threat is out-of-scope? ;-)

I'm sorry. Again, I'm not responsible for marketing comparisons made by
anyone else, nor do I think they should apply to this discussion where
we're discussing the merits of what AA actually _does_; not what
someone's marketing claims it does - otherwise I'll go dig out marketing
claims about SELinux too ;-)
And, coming at it from that direction, I feel it does something useful.
Note that here we've already strayed from the focus of the discussion;
we're no longer arguing "the implementation is ugly/broken", but you're
claiming "doesn't do what I need" - which I'm not disagreeing with. It
doesn't do what you want. Which is why you have SELinux, and it's going
to stay. Fine.
If we assume that the users who run it do have a need / use case for it
which they can't solve differently, we should really get back to the
discussion of how those needs can be met or provided by Linux in a
feasible way.

I apologize for not using the word "confinement" in the way you expect
it to be used. I certainly don't want to imply it does do things it
doesn't. Keep in mind I'm not a native speaker, so nuances do get lost
sometimes; nor do I have long years of experience in the security
field. Thanks for clearing this up.
So agreed, it is not confinement nor MAC.
Would it be more appropriate if I used the word "restricts" or
"constrains"?
