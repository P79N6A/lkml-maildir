Hi,
I'm having some problems with XFree86 4.0.2 and DRI/DRM in 2.4.2-pre3.
I'm using a Dell Inspiron 8000 with a ATI Rage Mobility M4 32 MB,
and can get it running with DRI under 2.4.0-ac10. When using 2.4.2-pre3, I
can see each individual widget being built when I enable DRI.
output lspci -v:
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc: Unknown device
4d46 (prog-if 00 [VGA])
        Subsystem: Dell Computer Corporation: Unknown device 00a4
        Flags: bus master, VGA palette snoop, stepping, 66Mhz, medium
devsel, latency 32, IRQ 11
        Memory at e8000000 (32-bit, prefetchable) [size=64M]
        I/O ports at cc00 [size=256]
        Memory at fcffc000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=16K]
        Expansion ROM at <unassigned> [disabled] [size=128K]
        Capabilities: [50] AGP version 2.0
        Capabilities: [5c] Power Management version 2
Busmastering was enabled with setpci. To use DRI, bus master has to be
enabled.
DRI with 2.4.0-ac10 works like a charm (nice performance), but 2.4.2-pre3
lets me view each widget part being built when I enable DRI.
Anyone got any ideas? I've tried using 2.4.0-ac10's agpgart drivers, but
that doesn't help either. .config is available on request.
Regards,
Bas Vermeulen
