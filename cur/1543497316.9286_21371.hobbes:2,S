I'm wanting to implement a userland serial daemon which allows an
incoming serial port to connect via the daemon to an internal
modem on another serial port, however to do so I need another COM
port in my machine (for debugging purposes).
There are other possible solutions, but I'm not really interested
in them at all.
The problem at hand is that to put this card in my machine, I
need to disable all of the stuff on the card except the serial
port, however all of the old multi I/O cards that I have, have
jumper blocks which allow IRQ changing, and enabling/disabling of
the various COM ports, IDE, FLoppy, etc... but with no diagram of
what jumper does what.
I've searched the web endlessly, and can't locate any info for
these old cards.
One is a:
IDE PLUS-V2
and another
IDE PLUS-V3
Both have goldstar chips on them, and no other telling
information other than they were both made in 1992/1993.
Please reply privately, and not to the list.
