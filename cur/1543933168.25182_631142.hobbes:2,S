Well lets use the version attached to this patch. It turns out that it is 
not important to increase the number of partial slabs. Just putting the 
slab onto the tail of the list does it.

He is already the co-maintainer of the slab allocators. See the 
MAINTAINERS file.
SLUB: Improve hackbench speed
Increase the mininum number of partial slabs to keep around and put
partial slabs to the end of the partial queue so that they can add
more objects.
