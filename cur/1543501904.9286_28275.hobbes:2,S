The comx drivers do this and report the status of the line (actually 3
things are here: interface (ifconfig up/down), line (hw up/down), protocol
(keepalive up/down)). It should be generalized.
Btw clock problem: the hscx chip (used on one of our boards) cannot report
anything if it doesn't get clock.
