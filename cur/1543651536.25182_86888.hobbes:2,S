The emphasis on what the test suites are trying to achieve does differ
- eg the LSB doesn't have endurance type tests and concentrates more
on writing tests which can be used for certification purposes. And of
course the LSB test suites only cover the areas that the LSB spec
requires.

I don't think the LTP were tests derived from the OpenGroup (though
I'm not that familiar with them).
