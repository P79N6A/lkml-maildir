hi all,
i want to write an dynamic swap manager (allocate swapspace when
needed).
my first try was to write a little deamon, which watches the memory
usage
(from /proc) and creates a new swapfile when memory gets low.
but this doesn't work very well, bacause there can be critical
situations :
* an application could request more memory than currently free - the
swap
deamon can't increase the swapspace as fast as necessary.
* the swap deamon could get trouble if the memory is really full and
fail 
to work (or even crash)
so i thought about doing changes in the kernel.
* move the swap deamon to a kernel thread.
* let the memory allocation functions block processes which request more
memory than the free amount.
* add a process flag which tells the memory allocation functions by
bypass
the new mechanism - for critical processes like the swap deamon itself.
where should i start looking in the sources to do this ?
ew.
