ok. Can you suggest any way for me to reproduce such a bug artificially 
on a test system? [i have both old and new systems, so if you can think 
of a way for me to trigger this i'd be happy to try]
I /think/ my two patches should automatically avoid the 'cap themselves' 
effect you outlined: the absolutely worst case should be that we'll have 
twice the IRQ rate of the optimal one - but no irq storm nor lost 
interrupts should happen due to irq trigger type mismatches, ever - as 
long as the basic mapping of device to IRQ is correct. [ I tried to push 
to include this in v2.6.20 but i lost that argument ;-) ]
