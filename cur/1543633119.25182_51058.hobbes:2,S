2.4.18 needs a hint added to drivers/scsi/scsi_scan.c
to allow it to scan targets with sparse luns.
Look in /proc/scsi/scsi for the vendor and model and
add them into the device_list array in scsi_scan.c
...
{"<VENDOR>", "<MODEL>", "*", BLIST_SPARSELUN},
If you don't configure lun 0, you may have to use
BLIST_FORCELUN which if my understanding is correct
will force scanning of all luns.
I hear there is some REPORT_LUNS code that will
eliminate the need to do this, although don't know
which kernel has it.
