Thanks, I've been meaning to fix it for some time. However, it didn't 
apply: 
patching file drivers/base/platform.c
Hunk #3 FAILED at 105.
Hunk #4 FAILED at 136.
Hunk #5 FAILED at 447.
Hunk #6 FAILED at 111.
Hunk #7 FAILED at 372.
5 out of 7 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file 
drivers/base/platform.c.rej
Care to fix it? 
Thanks,
	Pat
