It depends very much on the context - on the precedence and relative
importance of one operator with respect to other operators and the
statement as a whole.  In general I prefer spaces around binary
operators, but there are situations where not putting spaces around
some operators can enhance the readability of the statement as a
whole.
If checkpatch.pl starts whinging about operators without spaces that
will just be yet another reason not to use it IMHO.
Also, I prefer the style where the ? and : operators have a space
after them but not before them, rather than a space either side.
Paul.
