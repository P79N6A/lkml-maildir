I assume you wanted to say "When gettimeofday() is slow, it means TSC is
not reliable", which I agree with. 
But I need, in the driver, in the no-TSC case use i/o counting, not a
slow but reliable method. And I can't say, from outside the timing
subsystem, whether gettimeofday() is fast or slow.
I assume we could make it work with the monotonic timer instead.

I'm not arguing that the code is correct. ;)
