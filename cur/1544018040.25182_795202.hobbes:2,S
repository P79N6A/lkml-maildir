I think you need to check your arch/m68k/include/asm/swab.h as I get an
empty file when I pull this.  It looks like it needs a conditional 
include of swab_mm/swab_no similar to the other files.
Also, because of the byteorder changes, it looks like you don't need
a separate byteorder_mm/no as they both just include the generic
include/linux/byteorder/big_endian.h
Cheers,
