As I have read from earlier replies, ext2/3 replaces a filename with the new
one, given that it is the same length or shorter, and especially that might
skip a while when readdir()ing.
So I was concerned about the speed impact which would arise, if the filename
was never modified in-place but always appended as a new object to the
end-of-directory.
