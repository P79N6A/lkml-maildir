Alan, 
The problem, if I remember correctly, is that some kernels end up
gzipping exceptionally good and therefore require lots of space during
decompression. Wouldn't it be an idea to change the gzip -9 in
arch/i386/boot/compressed/Makefile to something like gzip -5 (Or
better yet, just gzip)?  This will cause a slight kernel size
increase, but allows it to decompress in all cases.....
