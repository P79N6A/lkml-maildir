Subject: lockdep, annotate slocks: turn lockdep off for them
From: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
temporary solution to turn off slock related false positives:
the slock is pretty much the only lock type in the kernel that
is half spinlock, half waitqueue. "Process level" and "softirq level"
uses of slock are excluded - albeit the spinlock itself is not
permanently held in process context.
The right solution will be to annotate slock uses with
acquire()/release(). (i.e. to treat sock_owned_by_user() flagged
areas as an exclusion area too)
(this temporary solution is not as bad as it might sound, because it 
does not eliminate the various ->sk_backlog_rcv() related dependencies 
from the validator's dependency graph - what it does is that it doesnt 
record them relative to slock. [the callbacks will still be executed and 
covered when the backlog is processed.])
