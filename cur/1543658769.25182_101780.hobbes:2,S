Sound fails on 2.4.19 with ALi 5451 built-in audio:
        Trident 4DWave/SiS 7018/ALi 5451,Tvia CyberPro 5050 PCI Audio, 
		version 0.14.9d, 00:57:19 Jan  9 2003
        PCI: Enabling device 00:06.0 (0000 -> 0003)
        PCI: Assigned IRQ 10 for device 00:06.0
        trident: ALi Audio Accelerator found at IO 0x1000, IRQ 10
        ac97_codec: AC97 Audio codec, id: 0x4144:0x5372 (Unknown)
        ali: AC97 CODEC read timed out.
        last message repeated 127 times
        ali: AC97 CODEC write timed out.
        ac97_codec: AC97  codec, id: 0x0000:0x0000 (Unknown)
The trident driver was compiled in during this run. lspci --
00:06.0 Multimedia audio controller: Acer Laboratories Inc. [ALi] M5451 
PCI AC-Link Controller Audio Device (rev 02)
I've also tried Alsa, and the snd-ali5451 module loads under lengthy
protests from
alsa-kernel/pci/ali5451/ali5451.c:389 ali_codec_ready: codec not ready
The related modules also load and everything looks fine.
No sound in either case, trident or snd-ali5451. 
This is a matrix vpr 200A5 laptop running Debian's kernel 2.4.19-5.
I've seen other people have had similar problems; is this a problem with 
recent AC-97 codec revisions?
Cheers,
Peter
