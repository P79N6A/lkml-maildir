Ok. I have been spending time lately on implementing this RFC. So time
for some questions.
If the vfsmount that is being moved is mounted within a shared-vfsmount
(i.e is in p-node) why should the move operation be prohibited?
The way I look at it is: umount the vfsmount, propogate the unmount
event to all corresponding vfsmounts, and mount the vfsmount struct at
its destination and if applicable propogate the mount event.
An example:
     If A is a vfsmount contained in pnode p  and B is a vfsmount
mounted on A, and B is moved to a mountpoint on vfsmount C the
operations involved are:
1. umount B from A and  propogate the unmount to all vfsmount 	contained
in p as well as recursively to all slave-pnodes 
         and slave vfsstructs.
2. mount B on the mountpoint in C, and if C is in
   some p-node,  propogate the mount to all vfsmounts in that
   pnode as well as recursively to its slave p-nodes and
   slave vfsstructs.
