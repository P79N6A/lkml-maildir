drivers/net/3c515.c:1052
                for (i = 20; i >= 0; i--)
                        if ((inw(ioaddr + EL3_STATUS) & CmdInProgress) ==
                            0) break;
   `i' is unsigned.  Potentially infinite loop.  Left this alone - no idea
   how long the loop _should_ be!  Added a comment.
drivers/scsi/advansys.c:7685
        if (scp->request_bufflen != 0 && qdonep->remain_bytes != 0 &&
            qdonep->remain_bytes <= scp->request_bufflen != 0) {
	            ASC_DBG1(1, "asc_isr_callback: underrun condition %u bytes\n",
	            (unsigned) qdonep->remain_bytes);
	            scp->resid = qdonep->remain_bytes;
	        }
   This comparison is bogus, but I'm unable to test the result of repairing it.
hp100.c:2785: warning: comparison of promoted ~unsigned with constant
      do {
         if (~(hp100_inb( VG_LAN_CFG_1 )& HP100_LINK_UP_ST) ) break;
      } while (time_after(time, jiffies));
Probably meant to be !.  Can't test.
octagon-5066.c:59: warning: empty body in an if-statement
	        if (page_n_dev != byte);
                __oct5066_page(map, byte);
    Probably a bug - can't test.
