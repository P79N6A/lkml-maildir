well as Darren's testcase shows, it might still have some bug - but the 
mechanism is intended to be strict. (the implementation had a couple of 
strictness bugs (they show up as long latencies on SMP) but those were 
ironed out months ago.)

yeah, that certainly makes sense, and it's one reason why i'm thinking 
about the separate SCHED_FIFO_GLOBAL policy for 'globally scheduled' RT 
tasks, while still keeping the current lightweight non-global RT 
scheduling. Global scheduling either means a global lock, or as in the 
-rt implementation means a "global IPI", but there's always a nontrivial 
"global" cost involved.
