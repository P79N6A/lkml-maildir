28bit it is a free for all, and anything goes in linux because nobody is
willing to commit and force anything over 8.4GB to LBA only.  People think
that "orphan sectors" are a bad thing.  IFF one can only IO in LBA with
the exception of sectors at or below the 8.4GB limit then one never needs
to worry about rogue programs existing out in nowhere land.
