I don't think the kernel handler gets a chance to do anything
because SYS-V init installs its own handler(s). There are comments
about Linux misbehavior in the code. It turns out that I was
right about SIGSTOP and SIGCONT...
Source-code header..... Current init version is 2.85 but I can't find
the source. This is 2.62
/*
  * Init		A System-V Init Clone.
  *
  * Usage:	/sbin/init
  *		     init [0123456SsQqAaBbCc]
  *		  telinit [0123456SsQqAaBbCc]
  *
  * Version:	@(#)init.c  2.62  29-May-1996  MvS
  *
  *		This file is part of the sysvinit suite,
[SNIPPED...]
/*
  * Linux ignores all signals sent to init when the
  * SIG_DFL handler is installed. Therefore we must catch SIGTSTP
  * and SIGCONT, or else they won't work....
  *
  * The SIGCONT handler
  */
void cont_handler()
{
   got_cont = 1;
}
/*
  * The SIGSTOP & SIGTSTP handler
  */
void stop_handler()
{
   got_cont = 0;
   while(!got_cont) pause();
   got_cont = 0;
}
Now, if POSIX threads signals were implimented within the kernel,
without first purging the universe of all copies of the SYS-V init
that was distributed with early copies of RedHat and others (don't
know about current copies, a very long search failed to find the
source), then whatever you do in the kernel is wasted.
