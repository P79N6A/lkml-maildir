What sort of timer chip problems do you see?  Is it something that can
be auto-detected, so that timer chip accesses can be made faster on
boards where that is fine?
I'm sure I've seen timer chip code in DOS programs that didn't have
the extra delay I/Os.  Surely it cannot be a very widespread problem.

I've also seen much DOS code that didn't have extra delays for
keyboard I/Os.  What sort of breakage did you observe with the
keyboard?
