Hello,
On 8th October I posted the following :

I have seen the same problem with subsequent kernels down to 2.4.14, which
I just installed.  I have also found the file size limit exceeded
error when trying to back up with dd if=/dev/hda1 of=/dev/hdc1 bs=16k,
where both partitions are 7.5 GB. Here again, I do not see the problem if I
revert to 2.2.16.
I was wondering (a) if the problems are related, and (b) whether a fix is
likely soon.
I am not subscribed, so a cc to me from any responder would be kind.
Thanks,
Geoff
