No, I'd actually prefer something like what Christoph Lameter suggested,
i.e. users (such as above) who want "volatile"-like behaviour from atomic
ops can use alternative functions. How about something like:
#define atomic_read_volatile(v)			\
	({					\
		forget(&(v)->counter);		\
		((v)->counter);			\
	})
Or possibly, implement these "volatile" atomic ops variants in inline asm
like the patch that Sebastian Siewior has submitted on another thread just
a while back.
Of course, if we find there are more callers in the kernel who want the
volatility behaviour than those who don't care, we can re-define the
existing ops to such variants, and re-name the existing definitions to
somethine else, say "atomic_read_nonvolatile" for all I care.
