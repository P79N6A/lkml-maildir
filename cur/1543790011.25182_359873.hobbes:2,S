The kthread API would be preferred, please.  That way we avoid using
signals in-kernel too - they're a bit awkward.  (Do you really want
userspace to be able to kill this kernel thread?)
The first call to schedule_timeout() here will not actually sleep at all,
due to it being in state TASK_RUNNING.  Is that deliberate?
Also, this thread can exit in state TASK_INTERUPTIBLE.  That's not a bug
per-se, but apparently it'll spit a warning in some of the patches which
Ingo is working on.  I don't know why, but I'm sure there's a good reason
;)
