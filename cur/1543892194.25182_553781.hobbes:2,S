sorry.
I want to use the interface aka /dev/ttyS0.
I want to process data inside of a kernel module to provide it /proc
(done) or as own char-dev (done).
but I can not grab the data.
It is part of my project in my studies.
It is more a conceptual work, but important. I want to release a howto,
when I complete.
answered completely? ;) Hope so.
