    Just FYI, I've had a similar problem a couple of days ago, and,
after a lot of testing I discovered that the problem was in the
motherboard. Try to isolate the problem: use the recorder in another
machine to see if that solves the problem (the recorder may be
damaged and may fail in DAO mode. Strange, but...). Check the cabling
and use another motherboard, or even another OS to do the burning in
DAO mode to see that it fails. And have a look at cdrdao, may the
problem is a cdrecord issue (don't think so, but...) :??
