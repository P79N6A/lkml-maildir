what driver are you using?  this seem like wrong behavior imho.  the first
part of close should stop the card from delivering anymore traffic on the
particular vpi/vci.  close should return after it is certain that no more
traffic will arrive on said vpi/vci pair.

almost all the drivers walk the vcc list trying to find a vpi/vci pair.  
enough that there should be a real lookup that is hashed.  however,
some drivers (like the nicstar) keep an indexed array of vpi/vcc pointing
to the approriate vcc.

that's really up the driver authors.  convince the author to change to a
tasklet.  change it yourself.  it shouldnt be too difficult in most cases.
