A small no.
A driver could sleep, but then it must set current->state back to
TASK_RUNNING before sleeping, and that should be very rare, otherwise 
poll()/select() will busy-loop instead of yielding the cpu to other
processes.

Yes, you would see lock-ups ;-)
See linux/Documentation/DocBook/mousedrivers.tmpl
If you want to support preemption, then the minimum is:
* we can't preempt if the current thread owns a spinlock
* we can't preempt if current->state != TASK_RUNNING
* ??
