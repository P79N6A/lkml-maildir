OK.
To be honest I entered this discussion exactly because I strongly dislike
idea to change something in this area. 8) Especially, in 2.2,
if 2.4 is scheduled so soon...
Returning to the problem of timers in /proc/net:
I would prefer to remove them totally to clogging kernel with ugly translation
to HZ=100 and I absolutely object against translating jiffies to real time
until the moment, when (and if) kernel will use real time internally too.
