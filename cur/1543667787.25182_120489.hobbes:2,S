  Silently Ignore if the device is already active/disabled
  
  Some drivers will try to activate a device even though it is already
  active.  Instead of returning an error, the resource manager will now
  just ignore this.  This should solve some of the recently seen problems.
  Also it doesn't make sense to return an error if the device is already
  in the correct state.

  ALSA SB16 PnP Update
  
  Updates the driver to the new pnp apis.  Although it has only been tested
  for compiliation, it is an improvement over the existing broken code. 
  These changes are based on a update by Shaheed Haque <srhaque@iee.org>.

  [PATCH 2.5] PnP changes to allow MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE()
  
  This patch fixes the MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE problems, the correct code was
  accidentally lost a few merges back.  It is from Daniel Ritz
  <daniel.ritz@gmx.ch>, below is the original message.
  
  hello adam, jaroslav, list
  
  this patch does:
  - rename struct pnp_card_id to pnp_card_device_id
  - fix all references to it
  
  this is needed for the MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE() macro to work with pnp_card's.
  jaroslav did this a while ago (changeset 1.879.79.1), but adam undid it a bit
  later (changeset 1.889.202.3). but why?
  
  w/o the patch gcc dies when compiling als100.c with the message 'storage size
  of __mod_pnp_card_device_table unknown' (this is from the macro).
  
  any reasons why i should not send this to linus?
  against 2.5.65-bk

  ALS100 Memory Leak Fix
  
  This trivial patch adds a missing kfree, the leak occurs when

  load off the pnpbios

  - adds human readable error messages instead of number codes
  - other small cleanups

  PnP Card Service Cleanups
  
  Moves probing code to a central location and matches when new cards are 
  added instead of only when new drivers are added.
