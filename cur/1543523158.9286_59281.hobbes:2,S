Only in this case? How about compiling a kernel or some other such task?
(I'm seeing corruption (files that turn into directories is one symptom,
haven't caught the reverse; others are many duplicate blocks) since 2.3.20
here (i686 UP, mostly Red Hat 6.[01], 128Mb RAM). Note that one kernel here
ate half of /etc, another one nibbled at /usr. Be careful.)
2.2.x are solid, no strange stuff there.

Good idea. Will try that next time it blows up on me.
