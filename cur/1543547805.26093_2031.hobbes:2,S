    Well, while it would be a good option to have, I'm not sure it's a
    good idea to make it the default. If you flush the buffer+page caches,
    then later you will need to repopulate them. 
It is worth caching data, in ordinary circumstances, because it has a
certain chance of being useful and caching costs essentially nothing.
But often the data will never be used again.  It is not worth waiting
to write and then reread many megabytes of cached data.
    What would be nicer is if when you suspend, you record the cached
    block numbers (and then flush+clear the caches), and on resume kick
    off a daemon/kernel thread which touches those blocks, bringing them
    back into the caches.
If this is done in background, whenever there is no other disk
activity, it could not do any harm.
