Hi All, 
Thanks for your comments. I am posting this patch after incorporating
the review comments.
Please find the attached patch file. Please review this and send your
comments.
Thanks,
Sundar
Note:
This is the patch on PCI Express Enhanced configuration for 2.6.0 test11
kernel following up to the Vladimir (Vladimir.Kondratiev@intel.com) and
Harinarayanan (Harinarayanan.Seshadri@intel.com)  and my previous
patches .
I tested it on our i386 platform. 
This patch also implements a mechanism for the kernel to find the
chipset specific mmcfg base address. The kernel will detect the base
address of the chipset through the ACPI table entry and based on that
the PCI subsystem will be initialized.
