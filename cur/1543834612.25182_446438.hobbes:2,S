Hi,
I'm playing around with my local copy of linux-2.6 git tree. I'm building 
everything to a separate directory using O= to keep "git status" silent.
After building I sometimes find a file kernel/resource.c.1 in my git tree that 
doesn't really belong there. Who is generating this file, for what reason and 
why doesn't it get created in my output directory?
