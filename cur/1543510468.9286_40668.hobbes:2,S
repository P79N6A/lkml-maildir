I worked on Fortran and assembly code projects with multiple programmers
working in the same sections. The pre-rcs way of coordinating this 
is the change tag:
/* DMA19990924: I did something here because blah caused foo
   DMA19990924: and I even need multiple lines to explain it */
It is quite easy for anyone to grep the tags of changes done by
a particular entity and/or in a particular time frame.
(Although admittedly my 70's tags were not Y2K compliant ;-)
