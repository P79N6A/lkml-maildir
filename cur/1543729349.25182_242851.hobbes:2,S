Yes, but some people want to use 2.6.8.1 instead of 2.6.7 (NFS security 
problem) and i only want to provide a short patch to get the old behavior.
Like You, i think  there should be device-class depend accesscontrol-lists. 
But this will need more performance. As there are not that many device 
classes, i would suggest to make one verify-function per device class and 
put a pointer in the file-struct, which will point to the suggested function

Yes, this is really a problem.

Hmm, perhaps i should compare them against the mmc4-spec? They might do 
nothing with mmc-drives?

No, according to sbc2-spec it will format the entire harddisc.

According to spc3-spec (mentioned in sbc2) it will only used 
to check performance of the device or programm the firmware
