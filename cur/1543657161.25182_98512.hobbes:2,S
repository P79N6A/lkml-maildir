Obtain the newest module-init-tools from:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rusty/modules
You may also find it helpful in the future to find a lkml archive 
( 
http://groups.google.com
 keeps one under linux.kernel, IIRC.  I use 
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com ), and search it for any problem you're 
having.  I mention this only because someone reports this "problem" about 
once a week, so it's been answered a bunch already.
I don't mean that as a flame or anything.  But if whatever problem you're
having has already been discussed, and addressed before, a little research
on your part will get you your answer more quickly than waiting for
someone on the lkml to answer it (which may never happen).
