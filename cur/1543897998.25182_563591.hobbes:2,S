Update...
I did 2 tests :
1)  booted with option acpi=off
It booted correctly, i managed to get some load on one of the card and after a while (10 minutes i guess) the Timeout occurs. Side effect, at the same moment the sata contolers lost control of the disks somehow and the raid 5 array on the system crashed hard. I have no traces as i was unable to rebuild it (and i tried a lot of extreme  voodoo methods).
2) changed the 3com cards
i replaced by two cards,
01:06.0 Ethernet controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT6102 [Rhine-II] (rev 42)
01:07.0 Ethernet controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL-8029(AS)
reinstalled and stressed the network (small download from a laptop) and :
Jun 29 09:34:10 loki kernel: NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth0: transmit timed out
Jun 29 09:34:51 loki last message repeated 14 times
Jun 29 09:35:18 loki last message repeated 8 times
so it seems to be a more generic problem.
(i'v updated the fedora bugzilla aswell)
did not test the  "[PATCH] 8139cp dev->tx_timeout" yet.
