Well if we have the calls in there, we should at least make them work
right for the architectures there now. At the moment the flush_cache_mm
before the copy_page_range wouldn't seem to do anything if you can still
have threads dirty the cache again through existing TLB entries.
I don't think that flushing on COW is exactly right though, because dirty
data can remain invisible if you're only doing reads (no write, no flush).
And if that cache gets written back at some point, you're going to see
supposedly RO data change underneath you. I think?
