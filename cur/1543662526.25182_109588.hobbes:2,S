Well, it should be simple then to point out the problem, would you

I hoped we could discuss locking problems, as I said these problems are 
real, so it should be worth to describe possible solutions. Then we can 
compare the different locking mechanism and maybe we find one, which not 
only solves a part of the problem.
Rusty, I'm asking all these questions on purpose, I want to help you to 
understand the complete problem and how limited your solutions are. So 
either please answer my questions or point out the mistakes in my 
argumentation.
bye, Roman
