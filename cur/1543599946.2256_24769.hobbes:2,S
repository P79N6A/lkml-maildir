Please, a union of different pointer types is much nicer.  You can have
i_bdev and i_cdev without wasting any bytes.
This form works with GCC 2.96:
		union {
			struct char_device * i_cdev;
			struct block_device * i_bdev;
		};
If you're using a really old compiler that doesn't support anonymous unions,
(GCC 2.95 might be in this category, I'm not sure), then you'll need this:
	#define i_bdev __i_bcdev_union.i_bdev
	#define i_cdev __i_bcdev_union.i_cdev
		union {
			struct char_device * i_cdev;
			struct block_device * i_bdev;
		} __i_bcdev_union;
Either way, you avoid pointers to unions and you also avoid having a
named union type which contains pointers.
