The current journal code limits the number of async transactions to 5, so 
any given user should not be able to pin more than ~20MB of ram per FS 
(each transaction is a max of 1024, 4k blocks).  The admin can change 
this by setting JOURNAL_NUM_BITMAPS to any number >= 2 (controls the 
number of async transactions), and changing JOURNAL_MAX_BATCH to any 
number larger than 256 (one way to control max blocks per transaction, it 
could be set smaller, but that would be slow).
This isn't perfect, as we still might hit problems if everyone else uses 
all the system ram, and reiserfs can't get blocks it needs for the 
journal.  But with a little work, the admin should be able to throttle 
reiserfs down.  Is it as solid as it could be after the changes from Rik? 
 No, his stuff will be very useful.  But, this is still an experimental 
FS...
