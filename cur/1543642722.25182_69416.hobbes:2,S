The inode block may be (probably is) in cache, so the hash doesn't get as
lost as you'd think.  Granted, it's an efficient hash, but actually, we'd
like to make it a little less efficient to get better distribution, and the 
efficiency argument re that improvement has dribbled on for *years*, even
though the improved hash would not be as much as twice as expensive.
That slow path is still very important.  Many loads always hit the slow
path (find).

Thanks, then I'll be able to sleep tonight ;-)
While you're in there, feast your eyes on hash() and meditate on how much
it sucks.  Bill Irwin did some lovely work a while back on sparse
multiplicative hashes, which ought to be dressed up and incorporated.
