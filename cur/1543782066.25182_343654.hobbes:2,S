I reported thet sched_yield() wasn't working (at least as expected)
back in March of 2004.
 		for(;;)
                     sched_yield();
... takes 100% CPU time as reported by `top`. It should take
practically 0. Somebody said that this was because `top` was
broken, others said that it was because I didn't know how to
code. Nevertheless, the problem was not fixed, even after
schedular changes were made for the current version.
  One can execute:
 		usleep(0);
... instead of:
 		sched_yield();
... and Linux then performs exactly like other Unixes when
code is waiting on mutexes.
