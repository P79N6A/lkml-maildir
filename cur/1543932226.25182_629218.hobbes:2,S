The sata_mv driver is currently not very good,
but should improve over this winter as some effort
is finally going into fixing it.
And the Highpoint RocketRAID cards are a similarly dubious choice,
as their onboard BIOS is known to corrupt filesystems before Linux
is even booted.
In particular, an "unconfigured" drive -- just plugged into a RR card
without entering the BIOS setup to configure a RAID -- gets sector 8 
overwritten by the BIOS.  This will destroy GRUB if it was installed.
And for drives which *have* been configured in the RR BIOS,
it overwrites a sector at the end of the final full GB on the drive,
for holding RR metadata.
