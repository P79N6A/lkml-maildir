Subject: [PATCH] Drop O_LARGEFILE from F_GETFL for POSIX compliance
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/3/21/190

On 64bit architectures open() sets O_LARGEFILE implicitely. This causes the LSB
testsuite to fail, which checks that F_GETFL only returns the flags set by 
a previous open.
According to the POSIX standards gurus the Linux behaviour is not compliant.
This patch fixes this by just not reporting O_LARGEFILE in F_GETFL.
This has been in several shipping SuSE releases and the x86-64.org CVS
treee for a long time, so is unlikely to break anything.
