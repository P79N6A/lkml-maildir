I fail to see why a module would have to declare aliases for itself.
Aliases are an userspace/after boot problem (i.e., which one is eth0?,
etc), so this means having _two_ (three?) ways of getting the same kind of
info (in-module/in-kernel, /etc/module.somethingortheother). Not nice.

It doesn't "move", it "replicates into". Not nice at all.

Good idea.
