I agree, but I can not stabilize the release without portions of the code
because of the onion effect.  You know this all to well.  Once I peel back
the parts to fix the bottom-low-level bug you can not put the old layer
back in place because of the gaps and the hole punch throughs.
This it will have to wait for 2.5, but everyone needs to get off the issue
that it is a filter and understand that it is a command completion
pre-handler.  I hope that you finally understand the point and we do not
have to fight again, next will be to take LT to school about the issue.
I hope by that time I will have a newer model that will force the enduser
to do the entire setup with a task-struct that includes a table for
setting up table io rules.  Then everyone will have to read the 404 page
doc to understand how to apply the taskfile.  In short if you can not
setup the taskfile in user-space and define the needed return, you have no
business calling the IOCTL; however, I will allow all BAD-ROOTS to ram
shit down the pipes and only certify programs that are known to do things
correctly.  This will allow OEMs to keep their secrets and remove Linux
from needed to know or allow binary modules to load in the driver that are
not native.
