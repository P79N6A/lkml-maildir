Erk.  Andrew, please drop that patch, and take this one.
It was actually Jeremy's paravirt cleanup patch which changed the
calling convention of rdmsr_safe() to match rdmsr().
I went "oh it's that fucking rdmsr interface" and "fixed" kvm.
Sorry for the bad patch,
Rusty.

rdmsr_safe() takes pointers.  rdmsr() modifies its arguments.  What a
mess.
Fix rdmsr_safe() with !CONFIG_PARAVIRT.
