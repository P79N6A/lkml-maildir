Some of them are not quite that pretty. In certain cases outb gets 
translated into code that does horrors vaguely of the form
	spin_lock_irqsave
	lane = (addr & 3) << 3;
	writel(1<<(addr&3), somecontroller->lanes);
	writel(addr, somecontroller->offset);
	writel(val << lane, somecontroller->somewhere);
	spin_unlock_irqrestore
Other code has extra magic reads in to work around fpga pci bridges that
forgot out is synchronous and writel is posted.
A better summary from the higher levels of the kernel would be "don't
look behind the sofa, there might be a monster lurking".
The only way I can see VGA routing working is to have some kind of arch
code that can tell you which devices are on the same VGA legacy tree.
That then allows a vga layer to walk VGA devices and ask arch code the
typically simple question
		pci_vga_shared_router(pdev1, pdev2)
