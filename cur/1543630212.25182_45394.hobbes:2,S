   for example, if TOE was supported in a driver (eg. /dev/toeN) which allowed 
   user-space to mmap() into RAM (either on the card or main memory which the 
   TOE card DMAs into/out-of).
This is a very old concept, see UNET.
But that is %100 outside the realm of the TCP on a card stuff.
You don't even need firmware to do UNET, you just export the
packet descriptor rings into userspace.  Like I said, it's a
"been there, done that" technology.
Franks a lot,
