I thought of using as subject "great PITAs of our current stable
kernel" ... the automatic placement of static routes when I bring
up an interface.
1) I believe I just did "ifconfig lo:7 machineB" on machineA and
immediately lost contact. I think I can guess why. It now doesn't
have a route to localhost, having just changed the static routes
through the whole loopback interface.
Thanks, but no thanks. SUSE 6.3 standard 2.2.10 kernel.
2) I can't get an alias to go away. If I ifconfig down lo:7 and
then take out the entire loopback interface with ifconfig lo
down, when I do ifconfig lo up, lo:7 will reappear also.
The best I can do is reconfigure lo:7 to something harmless, like
127.0.0.8. It's a kind of zombie alias.
Is this PITA still around in 2.3.9? PLEASE make it stop if so .. (goes
and cries in corner).
Peter
