Ok, not PPro, but with Processor Family set to K6, CYRIXIII, or any of
the 3 WINCHIP choices, it is compiled with -march=i585 and without F00F.
(Fixing that by adding F00F too all those non-Intel processors, just to
make sure non-F00F kernels crash with a cmov instruction is too subtle
for my taste.)
Anyway, it should complain about lack of cmov not crash :)

I once suggested turning off XMM entirely when prefetch is broken and
not fixed, but that resulted in a mild toasting, hence the extra
synthetic flag.
It's not really split: XMM_PREFETCH is an additional flag, on top of
XMM, which simply means Linux decided it's safe to use the prefetch
instruction.
The only reason it's a feature flag is because the "alternative" macro
needs one.

Read the code again.  It does what you think it doesn't do, so to speak.
