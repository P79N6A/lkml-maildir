Great! The ck4 performance was actually substantially better than ck3 
(on the desktop) so here's hoping you enjoy ck5 which basically performs 
the same.

Well I think they're all ready for prime time now, I just dont think 
prime time is ready for it. This is too large a change for mainline 2.6 
which keeps -ck in business ;)

It's been around for quite a while, and akpm has not expressed any 
interest in it so I think this will only ever flounder in the -ck domain.

P.S. You seem to have preempted the arrival of my -ck5 announcement to 
lkml, as will this response. lkml does that sometimes...
P.P.S. It's "isochronous scheduling" :P Means "same time".
