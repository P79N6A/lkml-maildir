I believe that companies will eventually see it costs less and the benefits 
higher to open source their drivers.  But that is a conclusion and paradigm 
that they will have to evolve to themselves, and shoving it down their 
throats will only lengthen the process.  The first step is to support their 
hardware under the platform (linux), and that is what I am focusing on.  
Thanks for the technical analysis and suggestions.
