So what I worry about with this approach is that it can really blow
out the latency of a balancing operation. Say you have N-1 CPUs with
lots of stuff locked on their runqueues.
The solution I envisage is to do a "rotor" approach. For example
the last attempted CPU could be stored in the starving CPU's sd...
and it will subsequently try another one.
I've been hot and cold on such an implementation for a while: on one
hand it is a real problem we have; OTOH I was hoping that the domain
balancing might be better generalised. But I increasingly don't
think we should let perfect stand in the way of good... ;)
Would you be interested in testing a patch?
