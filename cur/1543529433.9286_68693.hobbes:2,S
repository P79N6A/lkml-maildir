In my situation, I don't even need any cards in the machine (if all is
compiled into the kernel), first touch of the mouse, and the system is
basically a paper weight.  If I have the nic in it, I can telnet to it and
kill the process reading psaux and everything is fine, but the mouse will
never work.  What's odd is if I remove the cdrom from the machine and boot
(or the last time I checked with 2.3.48) everything was fine.
CDRom is compiled as modules.  If someone could show me how to use the
ioctls to rescan the IDE bus, I can insert the cdrom and see what happens.
