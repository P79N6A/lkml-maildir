The commited "Fix signalfd interaction with thread-private signals"
(commit caec4e8dc85e0644ec24aeb36285e1ba02da58cc) doesn't implement
this.
We can do something like
	int signalfd_dequeue_signal(struct task_struct *tsk, sigset_t *mask, siginfo_t *info)
	{
		if (tsk->tgid == current->tgid)
			tsk = current;
		return dequeue_signal(tsk, mask, info);
	}
(still I can't understand why should we change signalfd).
Oleg.
