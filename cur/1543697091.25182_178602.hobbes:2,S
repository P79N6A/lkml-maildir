First, thanks for doing this since I never got around to it.
I like having the arg names in function prototypes, but they don't
have to be terribly descriptive IMO.  Read the kernel-doc for
descriptions...
Consequently I don't find the arg-rename patch needed.
BTW, where did you find good references for creating kernel-doc?

Evolution mangles in-line patches??  That's too bad.
Attachments are more difficult to review/reply to.

Don't need that last line.  Kernel headers don't normally say things
like that, and it's #included by callers to parser as well as parser
itself.  I.e., it's not only for lib/parser.c.

for match_token:

+ * to it. Tokens can include up to MAX_OPT_ARGS instances of basic c-style
+ * format identifiers which will be taken into account when matching the
+ * tokens, and whose locations will be returned in the @args array.
Use %MAX_OPT_ARGS consistently.
Don't need "c-style" at all IMO, or at least make it "C-style".
for match_strcpy:
+ * Description: Copies the set of characters represented by the given
+ * &substring_t @s to the c-style string @to. Caller guarantees that @to is
+ * large enough to hold the characters of @s.
s/c-style//
Thanks again.
