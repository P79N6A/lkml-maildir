sorry for the delay - please do submit a bug at bughost.org to enable us
to track this problem.
The error you get is strange - the reason why the channel could not be
set was because the device is not considered to be ready. Yet, from your
debug log all the required steps appear to have completed successfully.
Could you please add a print to the function
iwl4965-base.c:iwl4965_is_ready to see what the value of priv->status
is?
Thanks
