   Do you mean a sys32_*_wrapper ?  Would you please offer up those
   five lines of code?
Can the person submitting these patches at least test
them before posting them?
I have no desire to see these changes in the tree, and I don't
ask other people to code up things which are my problem to code
up a proper patch I care about.
