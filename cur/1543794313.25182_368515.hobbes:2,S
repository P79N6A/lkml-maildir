Ok, so where is the config option?
find . | xargs grep CONFIG_SND_SB16
./arch/i386/defconfig:# CONFIG_SND_SB16 is not set
./arch/ppc/configs/common_defconfig:# CONFIG_SND_SB16 is not set
./arch/ppc/configs/power3_defconfig:# CONFIG_SND_SB16 is not set
./include/sound/sb.h:   void *csp; /* used only when CONFIG_SND_SB16_CSP is 
set */
./sound/isa/sb/Makefile:obj-$(CONFIG_SND_SB16) += snd-sb16.o snd-sb16-dsp.o 
snd-sb-common.o
./sound/isa/sb/Makefile:ifeq ($(CONFIG_SND_SB16_CSP),y)
./sound/isa/sb/Makefile:  obj-$(CONFIG_SND_SB16) += snd-sb16-csp.o
./sound/isa/sb/sb16.c:#ifdef CONFIG_SND_SB16_CSP
./sound/isa/sb/sb16.c:#ifdef CONFIG_SND_SB16_CSP
./sound/isa/sb/sb16.c:#ifdef CONFIG_SND_SB16_CSP
./sound/isa/sb/sb16.c:#ifdef CONFIG_SND_SB16_CSP
./sound/isa/sb/sb16_main.c:#ifdef CONFIG_SND_SB16_CSP
It's in defconfig, source, and the makefile, but nowhere in Kconfig...
