Thanks.  You'll definitely want to look at the _second_ version of that patch 
rather than the first, though. :)

Nope.  Any of this could be done in C.  (And that's the approach Sam Ravnborg 
prefers to take for the second patch in the series, upgrading unifdef.c to do 
everything itself.)
I tend to lean towards scripts that create header files rather than programs 
that create header files, but as long as you remember to use HOSTCC it's 
fairly straightforward. :)

Oh pile on.  It beats being dismissed as the only one on the planet who cares 
about the issue (again). :)
