FWIW: I use Reiser4 for several months now on several i386 systems, and
I always remove the "&& !4STACKS" from fs/reiser4/Kconfig and enable
CONFIG_4KSTACKS:
# zgrep -E 'REISER4|4KSTACKS' /proc/config.gz 
CONFIG_REISER4_FS=y
# CONFIG_REISER4_DEBUG is not set
CONFIG_4KSTACKS=y
Also using lvm2, or raid1, or raid5, on ATA, SATA or SCSI. I haven't
experienced any problems yet, but the systems don't see heavy usage too.
	Kind regards, Sander
