Blame the hardware designers... and give me my big allocations. :)
Sounds drivers (not mine though, <g>) do stuff like
	order = 20; /* just a made-up high number*/
	while ((order-- > 0) && (mem == NULL)) {
		mem = __get_free_pages (GFP_KERNEL, order);
	}
	/* use sound buffer 'mem' */
Older or modern, less-than-cool framegrabbers need tons of contiguous
memory too...
