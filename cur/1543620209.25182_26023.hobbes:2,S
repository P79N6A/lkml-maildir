 Actually really sane architectures, such as MIPS, have no unused
registers floating around just in case someone needs one in the next ten
years or so.  They require an ABI change which can only be justified if
the benefit is large.  So far I failed to see the benefit, but hopefully
it's only a fault of mine.
