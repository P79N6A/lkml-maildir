Did you read the comment immediately above that
calculation?
/*
 * scsi_malloc() can only dish out items of PAGE_SIZE or less, so we cannot

 */
so scsi_malloc() would need some reworking to handle more.
OTOH, it appears that this is all removed in 2.6.10++, so moving to
2.6.recent is probably your best choice.
