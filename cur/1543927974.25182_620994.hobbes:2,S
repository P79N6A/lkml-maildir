OK, say "as a rule".

I think we can set a rule that NEEDINFO bugs with a developer request not
responded to by the reporter for a month are closable.  Everyone with
sufficient access rights who spots such a bug can close it.

These are two different issues.
On the one hand, I don't see anything wrong with encouraging bug reporters to
test new kernels, especially if the reported problems depend on hardware, as it
is possible that the bug will get fixed as a result of a loosely related change
(like a fix for another bug etc.).  [Still, in such cases it would be good to
identify the change that fixes the problem anyway.]
OTOH, the situations in which good bug reports are not responded to are not
acceptable.  There should be a way to make developers take care of _their_
code, because by not doing so they hurt us all, big time.

The Bugzilla has a considerable "barrier to entry" for new bug reporters, as
it pretends to require them to spend quite a lot of time on the bug report.
Also, some developers do not consider the Bugzilla as a useful thing and
wouldn't like to use it (which is why this thread has appeared, among other
things ;-)).

Sure.
