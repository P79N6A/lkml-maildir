let's get this straight.  There are five possible cases
a) CONFIG_NETFILTER disabled.  you won't even have the netfilter hooks
   in the network stack (so certainly no netfilter-using modules loaded)
b) CONFIG_NETFILTER enabled, but _no_ modules (iptable_filter,
   ip_conntrack, ...) attached to the netfilter hook
c) CONFIG_NETFILTER enabled and iptable_filter.o (which pulls ip_tables.o)
   loaded, NO RULES in the table
d) CONFIG_NETFILTER enabled and iptable_filter.o (which pulls ip_tables.o)
   loaded, RULES in the table
e) CONFIG_NETFILTER enabled and ip_conntrack.o loaded, iptable_filter
   loaded or not, rules or not
So if you want to give us an idea about where the bottleneck might be,
please clearly indicate between which of the two cases you see this
performance penalty. 
This way we can isolate the culprit.
