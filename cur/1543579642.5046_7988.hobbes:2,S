I think my compromise of sending it to both simultaneously is better: if
you do reuse it, you've just got a cache hit (win); if not, you've just
burned some RAM bandwidth, which isn't a catastrophe.

Eh? This is a hardware system - Linux has very little hardware in it :-)

Actually, I'd like it to be a much more generic thing. If you get an
"intelligent" NIC, it will have, say, a StrongARM processor on it. Why
shouldn't the code running on that processor be supplied by the kernel, as
part of the NIC driver? Given a powerful enough CPU on the NIC, you could
offload a useful chunk of the Linux network stack to it.
Or a RAID adapter - instead of coming with the manufacturer's proprietary
code for striping etc., upload Linux's own RAID software to the CPU. Run
some subset of X's primitives on the graphics card. On an I2O-type system
(dedicated ARM processor or similar for handling I/O), run the low-level
caching stuff, perhaps, or some of the FS code.
Over the next few years, we'll see a lot of little baby CPUs in our PCs,
on network cards, video cards etc. I'd like to see Linux able to take
advantage of this sort of off-load capability where possible.
James.
