And does it run one image of Linux? Or more images each on few cpus?
How do they solve problem with spinlock livelocks?
If time-spent-outside-spinlock/time-spent-in-spinlock < number-of-cpus, 
the spinlock livelock may happen --- this condition is not true normally 
with 2 or 4 cpus, but for that high amount of cpus, there is a danger.
Or do they have some special hardware spinlock instruction that guarantees 
fairness?
