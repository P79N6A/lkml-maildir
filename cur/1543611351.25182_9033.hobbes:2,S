And maybe it is better to go with Geert idea? Remove mask, and
make image just really use cmap - if cmap entry is 100% transparent,
it is like that bit(mask) == 1, and add one more field for inverted
cmap entry. As no driver can use image/mask immediately anyway, there
is no big problem.
I hope that mask/image format is going to be specified somewhere
more exactly - like whether each image/mask line consist of 
non-fractional number of bytes, what happens if cmap has 8 entries 
and other legal, but hard to implement, features...
