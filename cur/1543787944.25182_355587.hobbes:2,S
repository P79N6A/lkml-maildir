From the look of that patch, this will just print
"emu10k1: AC97 is optional on this board Proceeding without ac97 mixers..."
and do nothing about actually making things work for people again,
or even to suggest what they can do to work around this situation
when their volume control breaks.  At the least this sounds like it
needs to mention a module parameter to force ac97 support.
What actually happens if we set ac97_chip=1 on the boards that
don't have it ? Is it purely a cosmetic thing, showing some
sliders that do nothing?
