It might, but the <linux/abi/*.h> namespace hasn't been used, so it 
isn't really legacy in the sense that you can have a possible conflict. 
  Having said that, <linuxabi/*.h> is the least bleacherous nonlegacy 
alternative I've seen (I'd like to skip the dash, though.)  <abi/*.h> is 
already taken.

Absolutely.  As I said in another post, if this is done correctly, a 
whole bunch of the ABI compatbility stuff like the 32-on-64 things 
should be possible to generate automatically.  If that isn't true, it's 
done wrong.

That one is somewhat tricky, and probably needs some ad hoc code. 
However, you get a long way toward the goal if you can express the 
following:
void * sys_mmap(void *, size_t, int, struct { int, int, off32_t });
void * sys_mmap2(void *, size_t, int, int, int, off32_t);
void * sys_mmap64(void *, size_t, int, int, int, struct { off64_t });
(The latter doesn't exist at the moment AFAIK, but at some point it'll 
be necessary.)
You can get even further if you can express the fact that the final 
structure in sys_old_mmap are "memory arguments" -- ordinary arguments 
spilled to memory because we ran out of registers ("prematurely" in the 
case of sys_mmap, due to backwards compatibility constraints.)

On the other hand, Linus just released "sparse", which is a pretty nice 
  C parser that might be useful for this, especially with some kind of 
custom annotation capability.  I talked to him about this a while ago, 
actually.
