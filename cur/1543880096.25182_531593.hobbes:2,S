Nonlinear is a must IMO.  I would suggest X = exp(ln(10)/10) ~= 1.2589
That value has the property that a nice=10 task gets 1/10th the cpu of a 
nice=0 task, and a nice=20 task gets 1/100 of nice=0.  I think that 
would be fairly easy to explain to admins and users so that they can 
know what to expect from nicing tasks.

I think this would be a lot harder to pin down, since it's a function of 
all the other tasks running and their nice levels.  Do you have any of 
the RT-derived analysis models in mind?

It might be easier to specify the maximum deviation from the ideal 
bandwidth over a certain period.  I.e. something like "over a period of 
one second, each task receives within 10% of the expected bandwidth".
