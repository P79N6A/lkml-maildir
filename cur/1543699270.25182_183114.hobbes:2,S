I think another way of saying it is that we now have a hotplug infrastructure 
to load the driver on an insert event, so if you want to load the driver for 
something that A) isn't detected on startup, B) isn't detected on a hotplug 
event when it's inserted after startup, the way to do it is to call modprobe, 
not to mknod a random device node and then try to open it and hope some magic 
side effect of open loads the correct module with the right parameters to 
make things work.
The driver is now loaded while the device is attached to the system, not just 
while the device is in use.  (Less races that way, you get to save state 
between invocations, etc.)  The lifetime rules changed.
The old way of doing it assumes you have a device node for a device that has 
no driver loaded, which was the default under the old static /dev but not the 
case in a fully hotplug system.  You have /dev nodes for devices that are in 
the system (with drivers loaded), and you don't for ones that aren't.
