Could you explain this a bit better.  The reason we need to split the
prefetchable regions from the non-prefetchable regions is that most
bridges can only cope with one region which is prefetchable.
Also, some machines have a limited (sometimes fixed address and size)
region that can only be used for prefetchable memory.  How do you cater
for this?
