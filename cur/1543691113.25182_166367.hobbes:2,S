There are, sure, but I'm not sure this is really one:
	ret = 0;
	if (file->f_flags & O_NONBLOCK) {
		if (!condition)
			ret = -EAGAIN;
	} else
		wait_event_interruptible(&wq, condition, &ret);
AFAICT this is equivalent, and clearer?

Definitely: the futex code is a good example of this.  But the
presence of spinlocks actually makes the barrier issue vanish anyway.

I don't mind someone doing something weird and needing to use lower
primitives, but I still feel the wait_event* family are badly
underused.  Perhaps it's just lack of publicity...
Cheers!
