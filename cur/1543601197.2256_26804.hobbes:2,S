Greetings,
I'm currently running kernel 2.2.19 fine, and I'd need to upgrade to 2.4 
shortly, but after a careful configuration when i try to boot it hangs just 
after the message "Ok, booting kernel .."
As far as i know the problem verifies with each version of the 2.4 kernel, 
and i think that it is an hardware problem.
I'm not able to trace the operations because part of the startup code is in 
assembly.
The cpu is a Pentium Celeron 166 with 32Mb of RAM.
If you can address me about what may cause the problem i can be more 
detailed about that.
Any hint will be appreciated
-John
