    Hello Robert :)

    That this means that I can mount more than one 'tmpfs' just like
if it's a *real* filesystem? I wasn't sure, since it's implemented
thru the page cache.
>It is dynamic, so you don't need to specify a size.
    Yes, I knew, I meant the maximum size. I don't want half of the
RAM occupied just by a programming mistake ;)))
    Thanks a lot for your help :)
