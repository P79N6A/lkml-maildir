The power management spec version reported by the driver doesn't exist as
far as I know.  Would it be possible to see the output of "lspci -xxx"?
Even if the kernel isn't able to understand the PM registers, we may want
to assume the device is in D0 and print a warning. The bar restore changes
possibly have changed this behavior.  As a result, pci_enable_device() would
return an error.
Thanks,
