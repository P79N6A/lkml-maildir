	Folks, there is a pretty strange detail of the allocation policy -
if cylinder group has no free blocks past the goal ext2 tries very hard to
avoid allocation in the beginning of the group. I.e. order looks so:
	* goal
	* goal .. (goal+63) & ~63
	* goal .. end of cylinder group
	* cylinder groups past one that contains goal
	* cylinder groups before one that contains goal
	* beginning of cylinder group..goal-1
It looks somewhat fishy. What's the reason for such policy?
							Cheers,
								Al
