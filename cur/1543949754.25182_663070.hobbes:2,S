I'm one such user who's been forced to add the mem_hardwall flag to
get around the fact that exclusive and hardwall are controlled by the
same flag. I keep meaning to send it in as a patch but haven't yet got
round to it.
Also, if you're using fake numa for memory isolation (which we're
experimenting with) then the correlation between cpu placement and
memory placement is much much weaker, or non-existent.
