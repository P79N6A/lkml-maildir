Hi! My machine boots and go into xdm, I then type by username etc. in. The
problem is what I type does not appear until I move the mouse. This problem
appears in 2.2.0-pre6 and later, but not in 2.2.0-pre5. 
Could someone in the know look at patch-2.2.0-pre6 and see anything obvious went
wrong please?
Thanks, Delman
(I am using XFree86 3.3.3, glibc-2.0.7pre6, serial mouse)
