Hi,
I just discovered that this patch is the reason why my compiles slowed
down so dramatically (thanks to Michael M. for the hint) 
The SUSE 10.0 ld goes from running in seconds to more than a minute.
I think I will drop this patch for now because I doubt the
runtime improvement is worth the compile slowdown.
If there is some binutils  release that handles this without dramatic
slowdown we can test for it in the Makefile, but i don't want it 
to be enabled by default.
