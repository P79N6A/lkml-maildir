To-mate-o toe-maht-o.
There really doesn't seem to be any real reason to create a new
flag just because the granularity is different. The choice between
_USER and _TYPE (and _ROLE for that matter) is arbitrary from a
functional point of view. I say that since Smack has users, but
not types or roles, _USER makes the most sense.

Somehow I doubt that will be their biggest concern.
