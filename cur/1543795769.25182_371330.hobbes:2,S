They have specs that say they're not. Intel has specs that say that they
are on newer systems, but at least one chipset breaks it.
Linear they are never because there are MSRs to change them.
But I'm surprised you're saying 2.6.11 broke. At least 2.6.11 64bit should
have always used HPET in this case. I only broke it around 2.6.13
where I added an overeager optimization for single socket DC on my side based
on a misunderstanding. Earlier and later kernels should have been ok.
32bit might have been different.
