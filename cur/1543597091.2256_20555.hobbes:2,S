When I read the 2.4.6 reiserfs code correctly reiserfs does not cause
any transactions for reads/writes to allocated blocks; i.e. you're not extending
the file, you're not filling holes and you're not updating atimes.
My understanding is that this is normally true for Oracle, but probably
not for iozone so it would be better if you benchmarked random writes
to an already allocated file. 
The 2.4 page cache is more or less direct write through in this case.
