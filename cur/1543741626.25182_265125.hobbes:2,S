please put the timestamps somewhere that don't end up in the final kernel....
My life involves reproducing complete FLASH systems at any point in
time exactly the same as the ones I produced at the previous point in
time, I've had to hack about 5 or 6 things in the kernel to do this,
I'd like to try avoiding people adding any more unless they really are
needed.. or at least give me some way to override it ...
