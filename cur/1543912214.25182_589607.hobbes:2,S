nope, i cleared the stats after i laid the glxgears out, via:
   for N in /proc/*/sched; do echo 0 > $N; done
and i did the strace (which showed a 1+ seconds latency) while the 
glxgears was not manipulated in any way.

none of the gear windows in my test were overlaid...

that's plain wrong - at least in the test i've reproduced. In any case, 
if that were the case then that would be visible in the stats. So please 
send me your cfs-debug-info.sh output captured while the test is running 
(with a CONFIG_SCHEDSTATS=y and CONFIG_SCHED_DEBUG=y kernel) - you can 
download it from:
   
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/cfs-scheduler/tools/cfs-debug-info.sh
for best data, execute this before running it:
   for N in /proc/*/sched; do echo 0 > $N; done

sure, send them along or upload them somewhere - but more importantly, 
please send the cfs-debug-info.sh output.
