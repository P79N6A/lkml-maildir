  Nope. Writing of dquots works following way:
When dquot is used (referenced by inode) it's written only on explicit sync.
Otherwise it's just marked dirty. When last reference from inode to dquot is
dropped, dquot is written to disk (if marked dirty). Then it's put to the free
list from where it can be evicted by prune_dqcache().
  So when you don't write dquot when the last reference is dropped you
have to solve following issues:
  * you need to assure dquot is written sometimes
  * you need to make prune_dqcache() skip dirtified dquots
  The first problem probably can be solved using bdflush...
The second one is probably trivial as dquots use small amount of memory (~100 bytes
per user) and so we don't have to care much about vm balancing.
