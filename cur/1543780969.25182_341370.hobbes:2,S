There is an error somewhere in my implementation of Clock-Pro.
I have made some tweaks but haven't found a proper fix yet.
The problem is that if I make things too well in favor of the
evicted pages, then pages on the active list may get replaced
by pages that have the _same_ inter-reference distance, which
would result in similarly bad behaviour.
Eyeballs on vmscan.c, nonresident.c and clockpro.c would be
very much appreciated ;)

Currently the statistics never get reset.
The number of "new/beyond" sounds about right for the
startup of a fully running Linux system.
