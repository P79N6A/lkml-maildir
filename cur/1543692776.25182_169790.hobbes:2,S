           Summary: Computer blocks when initializing ALI Chipset on startup
    Kernel Version: 2.6.0-test5
            Status: NEW
          Severity: high
             Owner: greg@kroah.com
         Submitter: bardok@telefonica.net
Distribution: Debian Woody 3.0
Hardware Environment: ALI M1563 based P4 Laptop PC
Software Environment: Startup
Problem Description:
When the system tries to initialize the ALI chipset, either as a module or
compiled into the kernel, it completely hangs.
When it is compiled as a module, it just blocks the computer, but when compiled
into the kernel, it prints following error:
Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer derreference at virtual address 00000020
printing EIP:
c03f6b90
*pde = 00000000
Ooops: 0000 [#1]
...
EIP is at init_chipset_ali15x3+0x120/0x190
...
Call trace:
[...] do_ide_setup_pci_device+0x93/0x13c
[...] ide_setup_pci_device+0x1a/0x68
...
The same driver can perfectly be loaded with the 2.4.22 kernel, I even get DMA
activated...
If the maintainer needs any other help, I have no problem to hack the driver and
make any tests or researches needed, in the case he/she has no access to the
hardware this bug refers to...
Steps to reproduce:
Compile ALI15X3 into the kernel, or as a module, and reboot...
