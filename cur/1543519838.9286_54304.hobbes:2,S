Worse, unfortunately. Now I'm seeing "lost interrupt" messages, the system
becomes sluggish, the drive light sometimes stays on with no disk activity,
and eventually X locks up. Here's an example: I was running a ppp connection,
X, Netscape, and squid. Squid has its cache on hdd, Netscape (and most of the
system) use hdc, and the swap partition is on hdb. I get these messages and
then X locked up.

Dec 18 15:16:01 perfect kernel: hdb: lost interrupt
I'm testing on and old 486 which only understands PIO. Not sure what the IDE
chipset is but it isn't new. Obviously it's a UP kernel and it's not sharing
interrupts. There are two controllers on the motherboard and 4 drives.
It seems interesting that hdb lost interrupts. Is the fact that I'm using two
controllers make a difference?
