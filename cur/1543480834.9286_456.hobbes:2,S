David I am happy to see that you have removed the ->ato == HZ/50 ==
quickack (that was always trashing the very useful information that we had
in the ato field). My delack patch was/is doing that too and it is working
fine so far.
But you had a bug in your implementation that killed completly delacks in
pre-8.gz.  The bug is that in the ato == 0 path you set the quickack bit
but then the skb_transmit() was clearing it and so the next delack
estimator was again in the ato == 0 path, and so killing completly
delacks. 
Here the fix. Since I was there I also removed completly the reception of
a little PSH packet that was setting delacks hardwired to HZ/50. I half
the ato now.  This looks a bit more sane for me since HZ/50 is zero in a
slow link (and maybe too long in a fast path where ato could be 1 or HZ 
could be > 100).
