From the file Documentation/SubmittingPatches:
        3) 'static inline' is better than a macro
        Static inline functions are greatly preferred over macros.
        They provide type safety, have no length limitations, no formatting
        limitations, and under gcc they are as cheap as macros.
        Macros should only be used for cases where a static inline is clearly
        suboptimal [there a few, isolated cases of this in fast paths],
        or where it is impossible to use a static inline function [such as
        string-izing].
