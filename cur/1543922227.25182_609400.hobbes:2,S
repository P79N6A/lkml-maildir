gcc [1] will currently always inline a static cgroup_is_releasable() as 
long as it only has one caller.
Besides this, the compiler has the opportunity to inline all static 
functions when it thinks this makes sense, and it can base it's decision 
on things like whether we gave it -Os/-O2 and which CPU it's compiling 
for.
Long term manually forced "inline" has negative effects since functions 
tend to become larger and more often called without the "inline" 
removed, so don't use it unless there is a visible performance 
difference.
