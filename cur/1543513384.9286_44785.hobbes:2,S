there is no reason to go through int 0x80 if you know what system call you
will be calling, obviously. But it's not a problem either ...

calling sys_function() funcions directly _is_ right. You can call
sys_read() just as fine as you can call ->read(). You could even do an int
$0x80 as well, but why should we, it's overhead.
i was not talking about _syscallX() and you were not talking about
_syscallX() either in the above paragraph.
you raise a new point of:

there _no_ difference. I dont know why you think that the sys_ functions
are in any way different, they are kernel functions which can be called by
any other kernel function. For example sys_uselib() calls sys_open().
vt_ioctl() uses sys_ioperm(). It's perfectly fine! Usually we do not call
the 'base' functions because it often just contains checks we'd pass
anyway (and the kernel is trusted anyway) - but sometimes we pass
information along (from user-space) that should be validated by the
top-level syscall function.
you are also raising the issue of why doesnt the kernel use the
system-call entry trap to execute system calls. The only reason: it
already knows the address of the function, it doesnt have to multiplex.
There might be rare cases where the system-call-number is not known in
advance (iBCS2?) and it might be better to simple wrap it into a trap, but
that should work as well.
