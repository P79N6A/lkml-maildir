ITYM "cute". As in "cute dancing paperclip". As colourized ls. Or rm
aliased to rm -i for root. Or 31337 cAp1tAl1z3d directory names in root.
Or manpages in HTML (yes, today I had to touch Slowlaris too, why are
you asking?) Or info crap verbose as "War and Peace" instead of manpages.
Or --ignore-fail-on-non-empty as rmdir option. Or "let's replace config
files with directories full of one-liners since packagers can't be arsed
to learn sed(1)" religion. Sigh...
