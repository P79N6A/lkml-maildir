Hello.
Its been a while i spent working with newer kernels. Looking at the tree now
noticed that 2.4.18 etc dont have a include/linux/version.h file?
has its need removed? or does it have an alternate home? I have see that up
until 2.4.9+ we had this and also still notice in redhat releases?
thanks
ashokr
