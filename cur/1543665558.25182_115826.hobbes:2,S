Well,
my card si 3DFx Voodoo3 3000 with tvout support
When non append is selected, output of dmesg looks like this:
fb: Voodoo3 memory = 16384K
fb: MTRR's turned on
tdfxfb: reserving 1024 bytes for the hwcursor at d1817000
Console: switching to colour frame buffer device 80x30
fb0: 3Dfx Voodoo3 frame buffer device
agpgart: Maximum main memory to use for agp memory: 203M
agpgart: Detected Intel i815 chipset
agpgart: AGP aperture is 64M @ 0xf4000000
[drm] Initialized tdfx 1.0.0 20010216 on minor 0
[drm] AGP 0.99 on Intel i815 @ 0xf4000000 64MB
[drm] Initialized radeon 1.1.1 20010405 on minor 1
[drm] AGP 0.99 on Intel i815 @ 0xf4000000 64MB
[drm] Initialized i810 1.2.0 20010920 on minor 2
When append is selected, output looks like this:
fb: Voodoo3 memory = 16384K
fb: MTRR's turned on
tdfxfb: reserving 1024 bytes for the hwcursor at d1817000
fbcon_setup: No support for fontwidth 8
fbcon_setup: type 0 (aux 0, depth 24) not supported
Console: switching to colour frame buffer device 128x48
fb0: 3Dfx Voodoo3 frame buffer device
When console switch, tux is black-white, all background is black and non 
booting text is seen anymore. X server starts normally and working, when I 
select console f1-f6 console screw up :(. When I boot with non append, 
background is white as I wrote down the text when select fbset, console screw 
up the same way as when selecting console from Xserver
