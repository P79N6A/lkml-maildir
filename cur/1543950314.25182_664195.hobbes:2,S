That's wrong.
The issue is that the kernel is entered (due to a trap, interrupt or 
whatever) and the state is saved.  The kernel decides to revector 
userspace to a signal handler.  The kernel modifies the userspace state 
to do so, but doesn't set DF=0.
Upon return to userspace, the modified state kicks in.  Thus the signal 
handler is entered with DF from userspace at trap time, not DF=0.
So it's an asynchronous state leak from one piece of userspace to another.
