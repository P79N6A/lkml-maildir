ok , 
may be you re right but let me restate : 
i have no problem under 2.2.13 and lower ... 
as for the pci/agp question , they get the same irq ... 
thats my reasoning 
also i have reproduced the problem on a 4 pci slot mb, 
so its not the board... 
however , 
the problem still appears on other slots but hardly ever...
one log entry per day while on slot 4/5 ( depending on the board) 
it was 95 percent of the time. 
and again this problem is only with 2.2.14 and 2.3.39 
anything under 2.2.14 worked fine ( 2.2.12, 2.2.13 )
