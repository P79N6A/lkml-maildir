Hi everybody,
I've been always missing the ability to have some kind of unique
kernel identifier in the UTS version string. So far, Linux just has a
version number (the one printed after the '#' sign). Basically,
whenever you rebuild a kernel, that number gets incremented.
Here is a trivial patch, that allows you to put pretty much anything
past the # sign - just put it in the .version file. If you don't tweak 
it, the default functionality is employed.
