Hi all,
I am not presently subscribed in this group.
But,i like to get some advise on how to proceed on my
problem.
It is,currently i have a ISA card(Multiport with uarts
PC16550,uPD71501) and its driver in LynxOS.
But now i want to build the driver for it on Redhat
linux 9 kernel.
I like to know
1. Is it possible to add the support for this card by
doing some modifications in serial.c?
2. If so,any documents/links on which all functions i
should need modifications?
3. what about porting the LynxOS driver to Redhat
linux? 
Experts,kindly suggest  an apt method.
Please CC reply to minnano2003@yahoo.com
Regards,
Manoj
