Subject: [PATCH-RFC] Improve randomness of hash_long on 64bit.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I'm still bothered by the poor showing on hash_long on 64bit
on number that differ only in the 3rd or 4th byte (as IP addresses might
on a little-endian host).
I hacked around the problem in net/sunrpc/svcauth_unix.c until this
issue got resolved, but it never did.  So I am pushing again.
The problem is that the bit-spares prime that is close to the
golden ratio isn't really close enough.
I propose 'fixing' it by using hash_u32 on the upper and lower halfs
of a 64bit value.  This is slightly less efficient, but most code would
probably be happy calling hash_u32 anyway.
More comments in the code.
