Did you forget return values? Or perhaps just redeclare those...
Also i don't quite understand the new status reporting you're doing, mind 
just explaining it to me a bit? The previous code would tell you wether 
the watchdog is enabled/disabled so you can tell wether the timeout period 
has passed.
