That's expected.  You can push/pop/call/ret using the kernel stack
because its 32-bit stack-size attribute controls how the stack is
addressed, but using it like that makes it use 16 bits (the CS
address size.)
This could probably be fixed in the kernel but it doesn't look
worth the trouble since the fix could be really ugly.

Something is calling this after pushing the arg to the function onto the
stack.  I guess it's always calling it with a 1 if that's all you are seeing.
