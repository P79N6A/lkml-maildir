Note that other architectures have never been an issue for releasing new
kernels, and that is _particularly_ true of architectures like parisc and
mips that haven't even _tried_ to track development kernels. In fact, mips
"anti-maintenance" has often actively discouraged people from even
bothering to update mips code when adding new features.
