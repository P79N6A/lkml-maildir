Subject: Crash, with "fix"'d 2.2.0
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I picked up 2.2.0.tar.bz2, from ftp.kernel.org mirror, in the 2.2 directory.
After having one crash, I applied the one-liner below, in mm.c
static void free_pgtables(struct mm_struct * mm, struct vm_area_struct *prev,
        unsigned long start, unsigned long end)
{
        unsigned long first = start & PGDIR_MASK;
        /*unsigned long last = (end & PGDIR_MASK) + PGDIR_SIZE;*/
        unsigned long last = ((end-1) & PGDIR_MASK) + PGDIR_SIZE;
However, a second has now just occurred.
Jan 28 14:48:52 mauve kernel: kmem_free: Bad obj addr (objp=c1864c40, name=mm_struct)
Jan 28 14:48:52 mauve kernel: Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000000
Jan 28 14:48:52 mauve kernel: current->tss.cr3 = 0222c000, Lr3 = 0222c000
Alas, this is all I have.
Running at the time:
top (updating 0.5s), xawtv, (X in the background, working on console,
bttv, with hauppage,) pppd had just come up, an mp3 was playing in the
background (l3dec, wavplay, awe32) 
This was a hard crash, surprising me with a reboot, as I was just bringing
up ppp, to see why I couldn't build ksymoops,
 (bfd.h not mentioned in any of the source tree, and not present) (Any ideas?)
Anything else I can do, apart from trying to reproduce?
