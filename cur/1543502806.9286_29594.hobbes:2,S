Here's where I'm at now (following all suggestions so far):
I downloaded and unzipped patch-2.2.6 and copied it to /usr/src/linux.
[ron@ns linux]# make mrproper
[ron@ns linux]# patch -p1 < patch-2.2.6
Ok. Here's where it loses me...
<snip>
The next patch would create the file `Documentation/sound/PCM1-pro',
which already exists! Assume -R? [n]
<snip>
Reversed (or previously appiled) patch detected! Assume -R? [n]
<snip>
patching file `Makefile'
Hunk #1 FAILED at 1.

Perhaps you used the wrong -p or --strip option?
The Text leading up to this was:
--------------------------
|diff -u --recursive --new-file v2.2.5/linux/arch/alpha/lib/io.c

File to patch:

I don't know how to answer these questions/what to do. I am running
stock Redhat 6.0 with both the Kernel-Source-2.2.5-15 and
Kernel-Headers-2.2.5-15 RPMs installed. Should I just download the
entire 2.2.10 source tree instead of patching, and if so where do I get
the updated kernel-headers?
Sorry for my ignorance,
Ron Brinker
