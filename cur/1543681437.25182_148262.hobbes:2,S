Subject: [HOWTO] Emulate processor sets (pset) for linux kernel 2.5/2.6

A while ago, I was banging on about kernel patches and whatnot to implement the 
equivalent of "pset" functionality. After some shoves/pointers from Robert and 
Miquel, I found that init(8) has the concept of an initscript(5), so that the 
trivial solution to my problem is to say:
#
# initscript   Executed by init(8) for every program it
#              wants to spawn like this:
#
#              /bin/sh /etc/initscript <id> <level> <action> <process>
#
taskset -p 1 $$
eval exec "$4"
and then modify the relevant programs to set their affinity to the other 
processors as required. Bingo!
Hope this helps, Shaheed
