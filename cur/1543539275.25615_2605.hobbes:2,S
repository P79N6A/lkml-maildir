I'm contemplating writing a very, very large MUD game engine for Linux, I
was curious as to wether or not its possible to "force" memory to be
swaped to disk, and to "force" it to be taken from swap and placed into
real memory, using the Linux VM system.  I want to circumvent the method
Linux uses it itself, so that I can keep everything in a "ready to
go" state, and use as much as the operating system's capibility as I can
without having to write my own swapping routines for player data and
objects/rooms. The reason I think this is possible, is because I'm
somewhat under the influence that GCC does this, but I may be wrong.
I realize that alot of people proably think this is a waste of time for
something like a MUD, but this isin't just any game, it supports more
than text-mode connections and it should be streamlined into the OS as 
much as possible. :)
Thanks,
