Move the locking down lower, so it just locks the stuff which needs locking?
It all depends on what the lock's role is, and so often that's a big secret.
If the intention is to prevent concurrent execution of mdio_read()
(reasonable) and we really need that 1 msec delay between writing the
registers and reading back the result then we're somewhat screwed.  Either
use a sleeping lock to protect that hardware state or go back to using
udelay().
