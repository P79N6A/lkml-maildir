Why it shoudln't be? It seems to work quite fine in Linux.

I tested programs for ino_t collision (I intentionally injected it) and 
found that CP from coreutils 6.7 fails to copy directories but displays 
error messages (coreutils 5 work fine). MC and ARJ skip directories with 
colliding ino_t and pretend that operation completed successfuly. FTS 
library fails to walk directories returning FTS_DC error. Diffutils, find, 
grep fail to search directories with coliding inode numbers. Tar seems 
tolerant except incremental backup (which I didn't try). All programs 
except diff were tolerant to coliding ino_t on files.
ino_t is no longer unique in many filesystems, it seems like quite serious 
data corruption possibility.
