Hi John,
Could you do me a big favor? Put a print in mm/highmem.c bounce_copy_vec
to see if you get into it.  If you don't then it seems that my system is
triggering this and it just so happens that yours does not. Looking at
my dump, it shows that there may have been some contention in the ide
interrupt. 
I let it run for a little longer and the system does eventually get to a
login prompt, but I'm looking into this further.
