Not really a regression, more like a long standing bug, but XFS has
issues in 2.6.18-rc* (and earlier kernels, at least post 2.6.11).
With heavy rsync load to a machine with XFS filesystems, XFS falls
over and filesystems are in need of xfs_repair.
I'm doing all I can to gather info for Nathan so he can fix the bug,
but it's hard to trigger reliably.
My point is that perhaps it's worth delaying 2.6.18 a little longer in
the hope of getting that bug fixed before release. Nathan?
At least for me, XFS in its current state (and thus 2.6.18)  is
unusable in production environments.
See the thread titled "2.6.18-rc3-git3 - XFS - BUG: unable to handle
kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000078" for the
full story.
