Hi,
I'm trying to apply the 2.6.18-rc6 prepatch (from
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/testing/patch-2.6.18-rc6.bz2
)
to the 2.6.17.11 sources (from
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.17.11.tar.bz2
) using
  patch -p1 < ~/patch-2.6.18-rc6
and I'm seeing various error messages, e.g.:
  patching file Makefile
  Hunk #1 FAILED at 1.
  1 out of 39 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file Makefile.rej
  ...
  patching file arch/um/kernel/time_kern.c
  Reversed (or previously applied) patch detected!  Assume -R? [n] 
  Apply anyway? [n] 
  Skipping patch.
  1 out of 1 hunk ignored -- saving rejects to file arch/um/kernel/time_kern.c.rej
Am I doing something wrong?  Is this normal?
I'm downloading the 2.6.17.11 tarball again just in case I've confused
something, but I've been untaring the raw material from a file I have
called linux-2.6.17.11.tar.bz2, so it seems unlikely.
Any advice appreciated!
Thanks,
