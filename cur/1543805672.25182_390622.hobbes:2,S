Subject: HELP: "PCI: Fail to allocate mem resource

I see the following Error Message immediately after the 
'Uncompressing Linux" line at the top of the boot:
    PCI: Failed to allocate the mem resource #6:20000@48000000 for 0000:01:00.0
What does this mean/imply?
This machine is a Pentium4 on an Intel D945Gnt motherboard, with
only a nvidia 6600 video card installed.
The error message occurs for the kernel 2.6.15.1
but not for 2.6.11 (which are the only two I have tried at the moment).
Is this a known problem?
Is this a problem?
Has it been fixed (Ive scanned subject lines, but don't see anything)
