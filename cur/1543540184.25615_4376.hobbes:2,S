The driver needs to talk to a pppauthd of some sort I suspect. Auth certainly
has to be done via user space.

NFS kind of vaguely does it. Basically its something like
event			kernel				app
						sleep on ppp ports
auth-req  ------>
			queue auth
			wake app
						process auth via PAM etc
						send ok to kernel
			tell hw
auth-ok        <----
