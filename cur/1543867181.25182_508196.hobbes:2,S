That would be effectively no limit, so why not just do away with them
completely? You have to solve the DOS issues first of course, either way.

Then you could just set the limit always to that max value and would
get the same effect.
Min limit doesn't make much sense to me because near all Linux data structures
are on demand only anyways (excluding mempools and a few special cases) 
and min is defined as the current number of used resources.

The reason NR_FILE is by default relatively low is mostly because the existing
ulimits suck :-) .i.e. you want to limit the memory consumption 
of a user you limit the number of the user's processes and the number of files
per process -- then the max memory they can allocate in files is process ulimit*nr_files
[in theory in practice there are holes like in flight fds in unix socket fd passing]
But of course that ends up with either NR_FILE being far too low or process far
too low or too much memory anyways. In practice it doesn't work particularly
well.
The real solution for that is "beancounter" which has been posted in several
forms recently (from OpenVZ and from Google). Basically it adds real limits
(for much more than just file descriptors) per uid or container.
With such infrastructure in place NR_FILES could be set to unlimited, as long
as you have a reasonable (large) default per uid.
Similar reasoning applies to other resources which are currently limited.
I think you're just attacking the symptoms here instead of the  basic issue.
