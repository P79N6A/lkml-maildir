For 64bit kernels this commit seems to be a nop, but not for
32bit kernels.
Looking at commit 4fe29a85642544503cf81e9cf251ef0f4e65b162 it contained 
two changes for 32bit SMP kernels:
- it enables the previously not enabled HAVE_SETUP_PER_CPU_AREA
- the following hunk:

Before assuming the bisection pointed to a wrong commit it might be 
worth checking these.
BTW:
I don't understand why these were mixed into a commit that
moved much stuff previously only used on 64bit kernels from 
arch/x86/kernel/setup64.c to arch/x86/kernel/setup.c ...
