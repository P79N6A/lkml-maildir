Hi,Jeff & Alan:
We want to extract our LAN card driver from tulip core driver and make a
new file uli526x.c at tulip folder,
because we have added some ethtool interface support and non-eprom support
in our driver and may be other change
in the futher. If our controllers support are still contained in the tulip
core driver, I think it'll increase the
complexity of maintenance, you know, tulip core driver include several
files and support so many other controllers.
Furthermore, I tested the newest kernel 2.6.12 and I found the tulip driver
can not work on our lan controller, and
I no time to debug it, so I aspired want to make a single uli526x.c file
just for our controllers.
Could you help us remove the ULi m5261/m5263 lan controller support from
tulip core driver and add the new single
uli526x.c file for us? Thanks a lot.
The following is the patch of single uli526x.c file, we have made a full
test for it.
