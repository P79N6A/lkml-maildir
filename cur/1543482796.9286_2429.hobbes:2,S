Will the change to io.h needed to support 2Gigs of RAM be submitted to 
Linus soon?  We are eager to move to 2.2 (over 150 machines), but need 
to have that fix in place.  To refresh your memory, the fix I am talking
about is this one (quoting a message from Leonard Zubkoff):
>I'm fairly certain that it is the virtual to physical mapping macros that are

>#define __io_phys(x)            ((unsigned long)(x) & ~PAGE_OFFSET)

Using this change is the only way for me to get 2.2.0 to work with 2Gigs of
RAM correctly.
