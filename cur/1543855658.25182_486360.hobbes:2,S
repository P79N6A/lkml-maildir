Keith, et. al,
I am having problems with isochronous receives, and remembered just as
I was getting ready to dig into the source that there was a message
about this stuff.  Lo and behold your message to linux1394-user from
September 7:

Did you ultimately have any success getting this going?  Funnily
enough, when I tested isochronous stuff in July, I just did iso
transmit since I figured receives *must* be working since everyone has
camcorders and whatnot.  My currently my iso xmit stuff does appear to
be working, but iso receives are not.
I have a Firespy and no reason not to trust it, so I can see the junk
I'm spewing out.  I've tried transmitting on channels 4 and 63 (per
your advice), but neither works for me.  I suppose it could my
stuff... nah.
