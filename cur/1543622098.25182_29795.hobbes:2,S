The normal linux way using multiple driver implementations are
aliases in /etc/modules.conf - see for example ALSA vers. OSS sound 
drivers for the same hardware.

See above that is *not* the proper interface for implementation choice,
which is *user* policy anyway and can be handled fine by the
existing generic module interface infrastructure.
For the sake of modularization. I have already at home a version
of ide-pci.c, where the signatures of chipset initialization
source code modules match the singature of a normal pci device
initialization hook. This should enable it to make them true modules
RSN.
The chipset drivers will register lists of PCI-id's they can handle
instead of the single only global list found in ide-pci.c.

It's inventing too many races (in esp. in the hot plug case) and the
module would be too small for beeing worth it:
[root@kozaczek ide]# size ide-probe.o
    text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
    8445      16       0    8461    210d ide-probe.o
[root@kozaczek ide]# size ide.o
    text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
   30951     521    9376   40848    9f90 ide.o
[root@kozaczek ide]#
(BTW.> I hate the ALSA OSS emultaion module splitup as well.)
As it goes about the possibility of multiple different probe
implementatoins - please show me a different one.
