Hello,
I've now found the reason and a workaround for this. Apparently, it's
related to CONFIG_FAIR_USER_SCHED and can be worked around by
assigning a really small value to the boinc users cpu_share (125 is
the uid of "boinc"):
$ echo 2 | sudo tee /sys/kernel/uids/125/cpu_share
While looking around, I've found the following patch, which seems to
address this:
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0710.3/3849.html
It has been posted here, but without any response.
btw: writing 1 into "cpu_share" totally locks up the computer!
Cheers.
