If you can open and write to the core as it is being written, you can also open
and write to it after it has been written.  There's no additional risk.  You
could also open and create a new core file with whatever contents you like
without help from the kernel.
By default cores are owned by the process's uid and have 0600 mode, so they are
protected from other users.
