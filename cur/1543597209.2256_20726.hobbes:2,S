Hi, 
I was doing some tests with the VM stats code and now we can see in
practice how bad the lack of a "per-zone inactivation" scheme in the
current kernel is.
Simple test: 4 setiathome's plus 1 big (1GB) fillmem running on a 900MB
total RAM machine.
Here is one vmstat output from the configuration above. (Ok, its just one,
but this is how the machine looks like most of the time during the test)

The DMA inactive/free shortage does not change for quite some time, while
pages from the normal zone are laundered/freed/pte's deactivated, even if
its OK wrt free/inactive pages. That keeps going until the DMA zone has
its inactive/free shortage gone.
Well, everybody knew that the "non-zoned" behaviour was a theorical
problem.
Now everybody know that its a practical live problem, and a big one.
