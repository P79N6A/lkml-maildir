Something along those lines, and have the first element in the kiobuf
be the data area containing the headers.

Most of that relates to where the headers are currently located, it's
something we need to look closer at how to deal with when designing
this.

Well, I should sure help on Gigabit Ethernet and HIPPI as well.
