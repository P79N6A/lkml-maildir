BTW; I forgot that the next intel laptops (and apparently, mactel laptops)
will have a small flash memory built in for this very purpose. According
to an article at extremetech.com, the flash memory requires an "I/O
controller"; IOW, it is not transparent and seems to need support from the
OS (although I guess that vista's "superprefetch" was designed precisely
for this hardware). Apparently, the main purpose here is to improve the
battery life (disks seeking for too many seconds can eat lot of power,
I guess). "Prefetchers" are becoming trendy, it seems

That's where the gain is; if the hard drive access was sequential people
wouldn't be talking about prefetchers. My SATA desktop drive also does
~45 MB/s, but it doesn't goes beyond 2 when seeking
