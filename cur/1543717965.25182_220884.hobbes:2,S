Jeff,
Here is what I see: pci_scan_single_device() at
http://lxr.linux.no/source/drivers/pci/probe.c?v=2.6.5#L590
 which calls to
pci_fixup_device() (line 601) which in turn use the quirks table at
http://lxr.linux.no/source/arch/i386/pci/fixup.c?v=2.6.5#L190
 (my chipset is
in line 248).  The quirks table for ICH3 use pci_fixup_ide_trash()at
http://lxr.linux.no/source/arch/i386/pci/fixup.c?v=2.6.5#L90
 - this reset
the BARs for the device.  Resetting the all (4) BARs of (ICH3) IDE
controllers will cause them to use the defaults BARs (0x170, 0x1f0) in
ide_hwif_configure() at
http://lxr.linux.no/source/drivers/ide/setup-pci.c?v=2.6.5#L420.
  This will
fail with any subsequent (ICH3) IDE controllers (two devices can't use the
same ports).  
Agree or not?
My patch (not sure there is nicer way to handle this), will not allow reset
of BARs if you hit any ICH3 which is not the first one. This will rely on
BIOS setting for all other controllers.

I do not think this is correct.
The programming interface register tells us if we're in legacy or native 
mode, which is what this fixup is concerned with, AFAICS.
So, the code should base its actions on whether or not the controller is 
in legacy mode, _not_ ordering.
