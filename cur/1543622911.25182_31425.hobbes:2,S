I guess "improved" is somewhat subjective.  It doesn't work with my card :-(
The wvlan_cs driver is in the current pcmcia-cs package, but isn't built with 
"make all."  I'm "just an end user" so I am not really cut out for figuring 
out how to build it manually.
Too bad there is no pcmcia-cs mailing list :-(
Guess I'll stick with the working stuff that came with my distro and try the 
main tree kernel again around 2.4.21.
