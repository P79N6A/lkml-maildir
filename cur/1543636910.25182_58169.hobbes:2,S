I'm pretty sure the window DOES scale upwards. As I said, you didn't
dump the other direction of the connection, which would actually SHOW
the advertised window.
The 6432 you're seeing is the server telling the client how much the
client is allowed send. Only, the client isn't sending anything. You
need to look at what the client is advertising to the server.

I don't think so. The transfer is unlikely to be limited by the
advertised window. Short TCP connections are constrained by the
congestion window, not the advertised window.

Not sure why you're seeing a difference here and it's hard to say
without a complete TCP dump. As far as I can see, the half­dump doesn't
exhibit any abnormalities.
This could easily be something completely unrelated to the networking
stack, however. You could be limited by file I/O, for instance. Have you
tried measuring pure TCP throughput without file access?
