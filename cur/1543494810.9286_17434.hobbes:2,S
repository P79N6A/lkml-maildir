Lint calls anything "suspicious" an error, whether it violates the
language definition or not.

You don't. You're trying to equate policy and specifications. They're not
the same thing. It is not a "compiler bug" if the compiler behaves
according to spec. If you don't like that coding practice, that's a
policy.

The resulting value is in fact the result of the assignment test.

It's not a boolean. The result of the "a=b" expression is whatever type
"a" is. The result of the expression is being used in a boolean manner,
but it is not in fact boolean.

I did this just now:
willer@anzha:~$ cat >test.c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  int a;
  int b;
  b = 1;
  if (a=b) printf("first expression succeeded\n");
  b = 0;
  if (a=b) printf("second expression succeeded\n");
}
willer@anzha:~$ gcc test.c -o test
willer@anzha:~$ ./test
first expression succeeded
Perhaps you could point out a compiler that behaves the way you were
expecting?
Take a look again at the Lint errors:
xxx.c: (in function main)
xxx.c:13,5: Test expression for if is assignment expression: i = foo()
  The condition test is an assignment expression. Probably, you mean to
  use == instead of =. If an assignment is intended, add an extra
  parentheses nesting
  (e.g., if ((a = b)) ...) to suppress this message. (-predassign will
  suppress message)
xxx.c:13,5: Test expression for if not bool, type int: i = foo()
  Test expression type is not boolean or int. (-predboolint will suppress
  message)
Lint is telling you that you've probably made a mistake, in that you
probably intended to do a comparison. The note about extra parentheses
has nothing to do with "extra sequence points", but as a way of telling
*lint* that you don't want it to complain about this. You can add 1, 5 or
500 parentheses and it won't change the result of the expression.
If you wish to call it bad practice, that's fine. But don't call it a
compiler bug, because it's not.
