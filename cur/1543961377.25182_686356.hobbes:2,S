It's too easy to impose crappy designs to end-users and tell them that if
that does not work they have to file a bug. There are a minimal set of
things that must be tested before shipping. Seeing that the default
terminal emulator in KDE on Mandriva 2008 is configured in UTF-8 and does
not properly render it simply makes me sick. This is broken by design and
even distros trying to get it working for years still can't cope with it.
There must be a reason.

I don't care about the *look*. Mutt shows me a question mark when it does
not know. I care about the *behaviour*. Having backspace go back farther
than the prompt is not acceptable. Having 80-col lines span over two lines
is absurd.

yes but you just had unexpected characters. Just like MS-DOS when
switching from code-page 437 to 850. Aside this, everything worked.

Unicode yes, UTF-8 no. UTF-8 is a compressed encoding of unicode.
That's as silly as if you had to replace your terminals to read
native gzip, and expect them as well as all the tools to work
properly!

Well, booting 2.6.25 with "init=/bin/bash" results in backspace
eating the prompt after pressing accentuated letters. Even the
control chars have been correctly handled on many UNIXes for
decades! The real problem with this crap is that it is viral :
"replace all userland applications or die alone on your island".
Then "ah, your applications behave in a funny manner, well that
may be because of UTF-8, but that is not important, just wait
for the update". I'm not even speaking about the security
implications it has on a lot of tools, starting with regex
libraries.

Funny that you mention Windows. Windows has been using 16-bit unicode
for a long time without problems. It's a clean encoding. Like it or not.
Since they have started using UTF-8, bare windows users have started
telling me that there are often bizarre characters in texts instead of
accents. That most often happens in forwarded mails. so they get hit
too.

Once again, I don't care about the strange looking, just about the
behaviour.

You know why we got this encoding ? Simply because it was designed by
english speakers who did not want to be impacted at all by the transition.
That way they can still use their old "elm", "cat" and "vi" with no
hassle and pretend to be UTF-8 ready.

I'm not suggesting to patch it out, just that we stay conservative with
the sources. Being limited to certain compilers is already a problem,
but we must avoid putting restrictions on the tools required to read/write
the sources.

No, you're speaking as a desktop user. You upgrade every 6-months. When
you have several machines, with various OSes, you know that the first
one which will stuff this crap everywhere will cause even more trouble
with the other ones. At one moment, you'll have to upgrade everything.
BTW, do you have an UTF-8 patch for the vt320 and vt510 I use as an
always-on console on my servers ? Clearly, the system does not have to
be "properly setup" to behave correctly. A kernel running bash as init
is a "properly setup system". Displaying wrong things is OK, behaving
badly is not.

As I said to Adrian, I did not even know there were non-ASCII chars
in our sources, and found it a bit shocking. Well, maybe I'm just an
old-timer and I need to stop working with computers :-/
