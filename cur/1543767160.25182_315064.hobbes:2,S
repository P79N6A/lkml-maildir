Sure, Suparna, I will try your patch soon!
In my patch,  I have modified ext3 directo io code to make use of
ext3_get_blocks(). Tested with a simple file write with O_DIRECT, seems
work fine! Allocating blocks for a 120k file only invokes
ext3_get_blocks() for 4 times(perfect is 1, but before is 30 times call
to ext3_get_block). Among the 4 calls to ext3_get_blocks, 2 because of
reach the meta data block boundary(direct ->indirect), another 2 because
of reach the end of the reservation window. For the later 2, we could
avoid that by extend the reservation window before calling
ext3_new_blocks() if the window size is less than the number of blocks
to allocate.
But if it try to allocating blocks in the hole (with direct IO), blocks
are allocated one by one. I am looking at it right now.
Thanks,
Mingming
