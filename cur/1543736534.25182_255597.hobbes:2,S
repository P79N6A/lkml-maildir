Randy,
Thanks so much for your help.

OK, that (with the explanation of the values) helped a lot.  I've got a
subsystem vendor of 0e11 and subsystem device of 00b8.  I guess that
explains the values from "pcitweak -l", which where
PCI: 00:1f:3: chip 8086,24c3 card 0e11,00b8 rev 01 class 0c,05,00 hdr 00
As I said earlier, I'm willing to believe I had the information and didn't
recognise it; and I guess we confirmed that.
OK, now to patch and recompile the kernel, and see how we go....
If this works, I'll submit the patch for inclusion in "quirks.c" - I'll
leave it up to the appropriate maintainers to decide if they want it or
not....
Thanks again,
James Roberts-Thomson
