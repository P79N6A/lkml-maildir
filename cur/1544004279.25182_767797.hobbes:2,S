Well that's an interesting question.
The risks with the current code are
a) It will introduce straightforward bugs, where pointers are
   incremented twice, etc.
   Hopefully these things will be apparent during testing and we'll
   fix them up in the usual fashion.
b) It will introduce subtle slowdowns due to needlessly executing
   code more than once, as in the hugepage case which I identified.
   These problems will hang around for long periods.
So they're good reasons to fix the macros.  If these fixes cause the
compiler to generate worse code then we should quantify and understand
that.  Perhaps it is only certain compiler versions.  Perhaps we can
find a test case (should be easy?) and send it over to the gcc guys to
fix.  Perhaps we can find some C-level construct which prevents the
compiler from going into stupid mode without reintroducing the existing
problems.

ah, thanks.
