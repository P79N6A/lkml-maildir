cool!

this was one problem, yes. There was another problem too: the code 
checked against rq->curr, while it has to consider the 'next' task (the 
current task might just be about to leave the CPU at the point we do the 
rebalancing). (A third problem was an efficiency issue: the code 
indiscriminately pulled all RT tasks it found eligible - while it should 
only have pulled ones that preempt the next CPU.)

could you explain this in a bit more detailed way? [what is the behavior 
you observe, and what would be your expectation.]

if there is RT overload then running the highest-prio RT tasks trumps 
any other consideration - including load_balance(). Also, same-prio 
SCHED_FIFO tasks can starve each other indefinitely, so there's not much 
the load-balancer can do.
