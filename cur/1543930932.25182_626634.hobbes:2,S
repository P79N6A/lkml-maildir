Even if it means you can get users to submit clear logged oopses out 
of many machines who hung silently before? 
Sure most of the XML infrastructure that tends to be used in 
user space is pure bloat. But if you don't want universal
interoperability and just for specific applications
you'll essentially just have a few hardcoded strings that
you'll write down some firmware interface and then a simple
parser to read the results. Again that wouldn't be a generic
XML parser, but just something tailored to the specific job.
I doubt it would be much worse code-wise than some of the more 
bizarre /proc ASCII interfaces.

They do -- the problem is that you need SOAP to talk the firmware.
After reboot the user space can get it out of the firmware again.

With soap it would be a slightly more complicated handshake 
and a few hard coded text strings around the actual information.
While that's not pretty if the result is worth it (and I think
general oops logging would be worth a lot of things) that's not too
bad.
