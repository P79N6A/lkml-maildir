There was a special case inside kernel/time/clocksource.c to prevent
clock switching during boot up. If you remove that (which I have) then
you will end up with clock switching happening a few times during bootup
(whenever a new highest rated clock is registered), that's the churn I'm
referring to.
The churn is not optimal. I've used postcore to prevent it, and make the
API usable earlier. So there is a reason for the change.
