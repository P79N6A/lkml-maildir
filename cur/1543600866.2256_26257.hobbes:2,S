If the read comes from block_read then the data goes into the page cache.  If
it comes from getblk (because of physical readahead or "dd xxx >null") the 
data goes into the buffer cache and may later be moved to the page cache, 
once we know what the logical mapping is.

We don't have any extra allocation in the cases we're already handling now, 
it works exactly the same.  The only overhead is an extra hash probe on cache 
miss.

When we're forced to do a memcpy it's for a case where we're saving a read or 
a seek.  Even then, the memcpy can be optimized away in the common case that 
the blocksize matches page_size.  Sometimes, even when the blocksize doesn't 
match this optimization would be possible.  But the memcpy optimization isn't 
important, the goal is to save reads and seeks by combining reads and reading 
blocks in physical order as opposed to file order.
An observation: logical readahead can *never* read a block before it knows 
what the physical mapping is, whereas physical readahead can.
