EEEEK! 1600? That is insane!
Consider cutting your rules into sections, and jumping to other tables to do 
sections of the work. Perhaps you can filter on the start of the MAC address 
and break this into smaller sections?
Also of note: MAC addresses are easily spoofed, so if you're using this to 
lock out people on wireless, forget it, it doesn't work. Get them to use 
tunnels (eg: ipsec) instead. The only real way MAC addresses even sort of 
work is when you're providing a hotspot, ie: where you can't guarantee the 
client to have anything apart from base wireless, and you should therefore 
keep a tight leash on users connections by either timing them out regularly, 
or making them keep open a https:// page to a login/AAA server (ie: a page 
that auto-refreshes - when they stop refreshing the page, consider their 
connection stale).
