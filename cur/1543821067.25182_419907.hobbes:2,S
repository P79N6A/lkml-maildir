I think the title "mm: serialize OOM kill operations" was probably a
poor choice of words.  It sounds like all I want to do is make sure
tasks enter the OOM killer one-at-a-time.  My goal is actually to
prevent further OOM kill operations until the OOM kill in progress
has caused the victim task to free its address space (i.e. clean out
its mm_struct).  That way we don't shoot more processes than necessary
to resolve the OOM condition.
