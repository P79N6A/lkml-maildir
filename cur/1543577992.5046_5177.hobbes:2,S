Hi kernel hackers,
okay possibly my HD is the problem and I will try to check the disc
with a Seagate tool (damned, i.e. reinstalling Windows) or even
reformating I everything else goes wrong.
Nevertheless I checked the partition with my old SuSE 2.2.16 kernel
and it gave a different error message:
hda: read_intr: status=0x59 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest Error }
hda: read_intr: error=0x40 { UncorrectableError } LBAsect = 2421754, sector
210048
end_request: I/O error, dev 03:03 (hda), sector 2100448
no more dma but read.
Fortunately it is still under warranty.
