works fine on FC4, i only minor issues: 'git' in the tarball didnt have 
the x permission. Also, your scripts assume they are in $PATH. When 
trying out a tarball one doesnt usually do a 'make install' but tries 
stuff locally. Also, 'make install' doesnt seem to install the git 
script itself, is that intentional?
