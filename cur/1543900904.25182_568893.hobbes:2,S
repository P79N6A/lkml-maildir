Maybe I misuse the terminology. The "device hibernate" here means put
device into quiescent state and save the device state into memory for
later restore.
But, how to restore device state after jumping back from kexeced kernel
if device_shutdown or hotplug/module removing code is used?

Yes, this is the right place to trigger kexec jump. Thank you for your
valuable comments. It seems that just the device state
quiesce/save/restore and CPU state save/restore code need to be added.

Yes, I have seen that code. The framework of current kexec memory
copying can be used for memory backup before kexec.

Yes, the device state quiesce/save/restore and CPU state save/restore
code should be added.

The above 3 steps are exactly what I have done in this patch. I reserve
memory with crashkernel=, use sys_kexec_load (kexec -p ...) to load the
kexec kernel and manage to jump back to normal kernel. But I should not
mix the kexec jump trigger code with the software suspend code, that is,
use "kexec -e", not "echo disk > /sys/power/state".

This is what I plan to do.

This sound good. The information in ELF header can be used to locate
necessary information for image writing.

Why a assembly stub is necessary? Is it not sufficient that just
continue to complete a normal boot (hot add the reset of memory) or load
the hibernated kernel (hibernated image) and jump to it?

Just not loading unnecessary drivers may be sufficient. But further
optimization is also possible.
The basic idea of optimization is:
For first run:
1. boot the normal kernel A
2. kexec the hibernate kernel B
3. jump back to kernel A
4. Save the kernel B into a image
5. Work under kernel A.
For normal use:
1. boot the normal kernel A
2. resume the image of kernel B
3. jump to kernel B
4. Save the kernel A into image
