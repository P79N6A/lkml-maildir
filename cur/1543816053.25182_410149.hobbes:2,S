The fact that background_writeout() seems to count up to 0 in the common
case suggests some serious bitrot.

Indeed, but how do we determine that?
One option that I thought of was to move the thread spawning logic down
into the worker callbacks, as they have more of an idea about what's
going on.  When they simply sleep (as is the case w/
background_writeout), it's very easy to hit the 1 second threshold that
the generic pdflush logic uses to determine whether to create a new thread.
I'm playing around w/ some patches that move the logic down into the
callbacks, returning non-zero if they need help.  Thus, the pdflush
thread checks if the callback returned non-zero, and if there's no
pdflush threads idle; if that's the case, allocate a new thread.
