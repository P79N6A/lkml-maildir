There's no point to doing this, since it's adding complexity to try
and avoid a very obvious and easy to find bug.  Other types of
resource leaks are harder to find, but a module not destroying a
workqueue is going to be trivial to spot and fix.
(There are technical issues as well -- if create_workqueue()
increments the module reference count, then you would never be able to
unload the module if the destroy_workqueue() was in the module_exit
function, because you can never even start to unload a module with a
non-zero ref count).
