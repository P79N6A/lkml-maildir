That is useful, as I was unaware that comparison operators were
allowed in forming the depends on expression.
If it actually offered the benefit of automatic
promotion/demotion to correct the configuration mismatch,
then I would be all for it.
The limitations of simply disabling generic HDLC support
on mismatch (essentially what Krzysztof suggested) are
not too bad. This would generally only happen on random
kernel configuration tests. If a customer decides to use
that method to configure a kernel, then they get
what they deserve :-) (a chance to bug me for support)
Thanks again,
Paul
