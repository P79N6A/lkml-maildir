Doesn't matter - the race is still there.
Well, not really, because we don't free the percpu data of offlined CPUs,
but we'd like to.
And it's easily fixable by using a statically-allocated array.  That would
make life easier for code which wants to take this lock early in boot too.

Scalability is not the problem.  At present, at least.
