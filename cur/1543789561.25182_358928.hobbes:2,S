Ok.  Hugh and I have rolled these around the last few days and what we
have now should integrate properly and solve the outstanding truncation
issues.  We should be ready to re-insert these patches into -mm.
The old patch [1/3] remove get_user_pages_optimization is no longer
necessary.  We now have [1/2] "the fault handler" and [2/2] "overcommit
accounting check"
