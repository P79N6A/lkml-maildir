Cool.  Yes, that means it did not change anything major.  Probably the 
only thing it did was to determine the volume was ok and the "chkdsk in 
progress" flag got then cleared and made Linux NTFS happy.
The driver used to ignore this flag but it now checks it.
This flag being set can mean that there is some serious inconcistency on 
disk (it can even mean that chkdsk crashed half-way through or the 
user rebooted the machine during a chkdsk) which is why we check it now...
Best regards,
