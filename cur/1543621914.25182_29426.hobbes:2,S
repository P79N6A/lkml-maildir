I don't know anything about the SiS5571 yet, please send me your boot logs related
to SiS IDE (you can't miss them...). If you know what your chip
capabilities are (see your motherboard doc, ATA33/66/100 should
be printed somewhere if the chipset supports these ATA generations).
As the driver is not yet aware of this chip it defaults to
original SiS5513 behaviour, this is most probably the source of your problem.
