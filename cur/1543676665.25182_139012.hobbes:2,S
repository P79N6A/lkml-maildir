Would it be worthwhile to resolve common functions from a library instead?
On request from Linus I made the lib-y change, and it is getting
a lot easier to create libraries.
So ak4xxx.o would be used to create lib.a in that particular directory.
A limitation would be that libaries would only be valid for current
directory - but that is OK for this situation.
On the other hand there should be very good reasons to clutter up the
build-system with this, so more users than sound is required.
Comments?
[Will there be problems with modules exporting symbols?]
