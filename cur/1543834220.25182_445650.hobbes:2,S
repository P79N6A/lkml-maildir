Yes this is the current xfs_repair behaviour (any previously
unlinked inodes will be found as unlinked on each successive
run, due to lost+found being recreated).  This will likely
be rethought soon (not far off), since it confuses everyone.
So, its all good - xfs_repair has fixed things and you're all
set now.
cheers.
