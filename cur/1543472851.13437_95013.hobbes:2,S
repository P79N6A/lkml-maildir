I write HEAVY DUTY scripts for LRP. All those scripts have to use are
ash, sed, and a multicall binary. (No not even bash)
Sometimes you do not have a 200MB worth of utils to acompish the job. 
The only way to do the above on LRP would be with a subprocessed for/while
loop. VERY SLOW and wastful of memory.
