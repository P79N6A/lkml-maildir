 I'm just pointing out there used to be no problem with making a
software-controlled eject for a legacy floppy device even long ago if one
wanted to.

 You only confirm what I wrote -- hardly anyone uses floppies, so there is
no need to keep mechanical compatibility in devices -- a complete dump of
1.44" FD support would be almost harmless.  Hence whether a Zip or a
LS-120 -- it doesn't really matter.  You need new media anyway.
