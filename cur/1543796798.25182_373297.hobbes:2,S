Indeed, It's a RedHat station. But I want first to
know if it's a kernel bug or not.
Perhaps the informations (logs, modules, ksymoops ) I
gived you are not sufficient.
I want to understand what's happen because the problem
is not reproductible.
Is it due to a module that I load? (I think to the
module "wdpiano"...?)
Is it a hardware problem...? (such as RAM, or I/O
error )
How can I determine the origine of the problem?
The sar base (I can send the file if you need it)
don't help me a lot... (all seems to be ok)
Thanks for your help.
Zine
PS : I don't know if you have already received this
mail; that's why I send it again without the attached
file... excuses me for the noise..
