That would be cool, but the impression I got from 
http://linux-ata.org/shutdown.html
 was that shutdown commands were supposed 
to _add_ quiescing of drives in order to avoid emergency head parking on 
poweroff.
That article says:

You're saying all this is to work around kernels _before_ 2.6.22, and instead 
of updating your shutdown you could just either update the kernel instead?

I'm all for leaving this to the kernel.  I play in the embedded space a lot, 
so the less I can get away with doing, the better. :)
