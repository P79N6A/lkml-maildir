This precise case of oops, was one that could be bitten by more than one
out_of_line_bug in the same function, copy_page_range. I found the
problem by re-reading the source code, certainly not by looking at the C
line where the out_of_line_bug was.

The string duplication is ugly, but dropping the bug line is even
uglier. For embedded systems there was just a "turn off the strings"
compile time switch, for embedded systems the other strings matters as
well.

that would been much better indeed, the probability of a line collision
in a non obvious place is very low and a push on the stack before
calling the extern function won't grow the size of the kernel image
significantly.

Cute, I'll sure make use of this featurette in the future :). (offtopic
with the out-of-line bug though, it still doesn't help there)
