Agreed. They are horrible.

Which, AFAIK, we can quantify as the minimum expected entropy in the output.
You can get output with the minimum expected entropy quite close to 1 from
good HRNGs.  Note that the same HRNGs might be configurable to disable the
whitener and output more bits, dropping to an expected minimum entropy of
0.75 for example (say hello, VIA Padlock!).
So quality is a property of (HRNG implementation, HRNG configuration when
the data was generated).
AFAIK, what really matters on a RNG is:
	0. trust on the design and implementation
	1. quality (minimum entropy expected on output)
	2. speed (minimum and average bits-per-second expected on output)
	3. whether it is implemented on software, or not.
Anything else is just *useless*.  And which RNG you should use (if you have
more than one available), based on the four attributes above, depends on
what you want to do.
> b) can the end-user trust that the design is implemented as described?
Heh, that's a hard one :-)  But I'd say HRNGs without at least a peer review
and open design are not to be trusted at all (which doesn't mean that those
which do have a peer review and open design can be trusted...).
> c) does it output lots of bits fast?
Yeah, you can go from a few bit/s, to some kbits/s, to megabits/s, it is a
damn important thing to know.

I'd say RNGs where the implementation is undocumented should not even be
supported at all...  but they certainly cannot be considered anything but
pseudo-random.

Yes. Leave the user to decide whether they trust it or not.  And if the
kernel needs to know this, default to untrusted and let the user set a trust
level through some parameter.

Sort of.  But IMHO, such claims, when not backed by some hard paper analysis
the RNG design and output by third-parties, really are a reason to
*blacklist* the RNG and not use it at all.

Err... not really.  Intel's 82802AB or 82802AC-builtin RNG gives only ~24 *
10^3 bit/s, which is not much depending on what you are doing, for example.
While a VIA Padlock dual-HRNG CPU can easily output 1 * 10^6 bits/s of data
in its highest quality setting.  With such a bit amplitude of speeds
available, I really doubt you can say that all HRNGs are plenty fast enough.

Heh. Indeed.
