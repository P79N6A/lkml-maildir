Yes, that number was dbench 90, but dbench 50,90, and 120 gave about the
same stats with the final patch.

I put the barriers in early on when almost all the calls were done
outside spin locks, the current flavor of the patch only does one
clear_queue_full without the io_request_lock held.  It should be enough
to toss a barrier in just that one spot.  But I wanted to leave them in
so I could move things around until the final version (if there ever is
one ;-)
