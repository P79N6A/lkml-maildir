Hi Kirill,
	Yes its work-in-progress and hence is not ready/fully-functional
(yet). The patches I posted last gives an idea of the direction it is
heading. For ex: 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/6/11/162
 and
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/25/146
 gives an idea of how SMP load balance will 
works.
IMHO the nice thing about this approach is it (re)uses lot of code in
scheduler which is there already to achieve fairness between tasks and
higher schedulable elements (users/containers etc).
Also with CFS engine's precise nanosecond accurate accounting and time-sorted 
list of tasks/entities, I feel we will get much tighter control over 
distribution of CPU between tasks/users/containers.

If you have any headsup thoughts on areas/workloads where this may pose problems
for container/user scheduling, I would be glad to hear them. Otherwise I would 
greatly wellcome any help in developing/reviewing these patches which meets 
both our goals!
