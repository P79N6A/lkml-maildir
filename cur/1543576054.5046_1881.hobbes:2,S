Hi Peter,
In _my_ case I compiled the EMU10K straight into the kernel.
dmesg shows it's found. The funny thing is that a second machine with an
es1371 board alos fails with 2.2.18.
2.2.17 is ok. Taking that .config and 'make oldconfig' produces a kernel
that doesnt allow the emu10k to work. (as for the es1371).
