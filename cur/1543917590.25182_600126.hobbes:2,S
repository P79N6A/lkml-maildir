Subject: PATCH: tcp rfc 2385 security/bugfix for sparc64
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

TCP MD5 signatures on sparc64 (big-endian) completely fail on current
kernel releases in interoperability with Cisco/Foundry or other
little-endian linux systems.
The root cause is a cast in the return statement of tcp_v4_md5_do_lookup,
where a tcp4_md5sig_key is casted onto tcp_md5sig_key without proper
conversion. On little-endian systems the upper 8 bits are cut of which
yields the expected behaviour. However, on big-endian systems (like
sparc64) only the most significant 8 bits are preserved. Since
TCP_MD5SIG_MAXKEYLEN is 80, this always yields 0.
In the calculation of the md5 signature afterwards the key is therefore
not appended to the tcp segment which could result in a security problem
since only the presence of a md5 signature is checked, and the key itself
doesn't matter.
