Does _anyone_ have a machine where platform works?
I can't recally anyone posted on the acpi/swsusp2/kernel lists that
they had a platform implementation that worked. 
Perhaps they had no reason to post? Anyone out there with a laptop
with a suspend to disk in formware/platform using ACPI that works?
I'd love to be proven wrong...
