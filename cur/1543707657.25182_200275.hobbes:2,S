If I understand the original post correctly, the numbers that we don't make 
available to userspace are compile time constants. For example, since I can't 
think of anything better, NR_CPUS. It is set during the config process, but 
one cannot read the number from userspace while running that kernel. I know 
that there are better examples, but I just can't think of any at the moment.
If I missed the point of the original post, please ignore me.
Jeff.
