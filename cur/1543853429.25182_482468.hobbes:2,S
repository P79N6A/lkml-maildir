Hello all,
I have downloaded the HP ski simulator and I want to run it on my ia32 machine.
For this I need to cross compile the kernel.
Though I tried the cross ciimpilation but did not succeed.
Can anyone please tell me from where can I get the pre-build binaries
and clear steps to cross compile for host=ia32 and target=ia64?
