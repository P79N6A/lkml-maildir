Ouch.  I'm very sorry to read this, Jean.
We don't say thanks for a job very well done often enough, but because of 
you and Bill Wilson (gkrellm) I have been able to track those things that 
have a direct bearing on the health and longevity of my hardware, and 
see, on screen, indicators that tell me its time to pull the flower, 
clean and re-grease it well before the cpu fails.  All with a minimum of 
bumps in the road for several years now.
So, a big tip of the hat, and a heartfelt thank you for all your efforts.  
I hope that the next maintainer is as meticulous.  Those shoes are, I can 
imagine, going to be hard to fill.
