I suspect I suffered a similar fate with the osdl test box. While I was away
letting it run a benchmark in smp mode the filesystem had remounted read only. I
tried rebooting to make some sense of what had happened but was unable to start
the machine with any kernel. I've asked the osdl people to have a look at the
box for me.
Previously a run in uniprocessor mode ran flawlessly.
