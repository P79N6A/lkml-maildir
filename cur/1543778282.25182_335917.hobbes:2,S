Dear
First of all let me introduce myself.
I am MRS ROSE WILLIAMS from  Africa.I am married to Late MR DAVID WILLIAMS of
blessed memory who was an oil explorer in Kuwait and Brunei for fifteen years
before he died in the year 2000.
We were married for twelve years without a child. He died after a brief illness
that lasted for only four days.
Before his death we were both devoted to our God and respect others who serve
him.
Since his death, I too have been battling with both Cancer and fibroid
problems.
When my late Husband was alive he Deposited the sum of $18.5million (Eighteen
Million, Five Hundred thousand U.S Dollars) with a Deposit Company in
Europe,the money was deposited as FamilyValuables/Treasure for security
reasons.
Recently, my doctor told me that I have only six months to live due to my
cancer problem, and this lead to a stroke attack which bother me most though
because I cannot move as I use to. Having known my condition I decided to
entrust this fund to either a philanthropic organization or devoted individual
that will utilize this money the way
I am going to instructs herein.30% of the US$18.5million goes to you to ensure
that you are prepared for the task ahead, 60% of this money will be used in all
sincerity to fund philanthropic organization, orphanages, widows and 5% will go
to the family Attorney who will prepare the Authorisation and the balance 5%
sent to me to at least prepare for my funeral and off-set my medical bills.
I am taking this decision because I don't have any child or devoted relations
whose behavior has left much to be desired while I am ill and above all I don't
want a situation where this money will be used in an UnGodly manner,hence this
bold decision.
Since my health is Retrogressing by the minute, you will have to send your
RESIDENTIAL ADDRESS, CONTACT PHONE NUMBER AND FAX and a little details about
yourself, because I got your address from the internet after a thorough search.
My confidential email address.
MRS ROSE WILLIAMS
rosewilliams@sify.com
As soon as I receive this information from you I will make arrangement to
prepare the Authorization through the family Attorney for you to get Possession
of the Deposit.
Until I hear from you, I pray that this letter bring you and your family good
tiding while my dreams to help humanity rest squarely on your shoulders.
May the Almighty God continue to guide and protect you.
Remain Blessed,
MRS ROSE WILLIAMS
