Some nitpick: when there are a lot of dependencies or a long select 
or long selected by list, you need to scroll far to the right, and possibly 
back left again. This takes time because the normal user set a keyboard 
repeat rate at about 30. (Under X, I prefer 35, but that's unfortunately 
not available on 80x25/console/tty1.)
These lines should be wrapped
