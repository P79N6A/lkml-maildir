    Hi unknown :)

    In my bootsector.S, it's movsw: repeat move (string) by words.
'movw' is 'mov word size operands'.

    AFAIK, the correct is 'ljmp': long jump. What kernel sources are
you seeing?. Old kernels (2.0 and I think that 2.2 too) used as86 to
do the assembling, and the syntax was like the Intel one, but with
some differences. Not quite standard, I think.

    AT&T in new kernels, fully 'assembleable' with GNU as. IMHO is a
better syntax, but I don't want to feed a troll here ;)

    Of course, there aren't Intel syntax anyway :) I recommend you to
see the 2.4 sources for reading the assembler part. Moreover, the
info section for 'GNU as' comments the differences between Intel
assembly syntax and the AT&T one. This will be of great help.
    In addition to this, I have a document about using GNU as for
real mode assembly that comments some of these points. But it is
written in spanish only :((
    Last, the Assembly-HOWTO will cast some light to the issue, too.
