Yes.  However if the driver forgets to clear the field it shouldn't cause
a warning.  After all, there won't be any harm; the next driver to bind 
to the device will just overwrite the driver_data anyway.

No, no!  The "gone" flag must be in the private data structure.  If it 
were in a container of the device structure, then it could be overwritten 
when a different driver binds to the device.
