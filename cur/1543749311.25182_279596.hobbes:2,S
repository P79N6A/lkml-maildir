2.6.x-mm is more like some of the work the old 2.4-ac did in merging new
stuff (its also worth noting that 2.4-ac ended up more stable than 2.4
at times so -mm might be stable)
The -ac tree is trying to be fairly conservative. When I merge stuff
that is a little less conservative because it has to be done then I've
tried to put a note in the relnotes for that release warning people its
more testing grade.
