Subject: [PATCH 00/16] [ISDN] HiSax: modularize card setup
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This is my work-in-progress patch series killing the last user(s) of
pci_find_device(), by converting these ISDN drivers to the PCI hotplug
API.
This is NOT FOR MERGE, just for review -- and hopefully some testing.
There are clearly a few nits to clean up (some patches are obviously
fixes for bugs added in previous patches in this series) before it goes
any further.
