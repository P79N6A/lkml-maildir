Subject: Status of HPT372A driver?

Hi.
I recently acquired a HighPoint RocketRaid 1520 SATA controller (I know,
I know, bad choice but I just need something to tide me over until I can
upgrade to a motherboard with AHCI love). This presents as a HPT372A:
00:09.0 RAID bus controller: Triones Technologies, Inc. HPT372A/372N (rev 01)
00:09.0 0104: 1103:0005 (rev 01)
The 2.6.17 hpt366.c driver is at version 0.36. I also found your patches
to l-k earlier this year, but I'm not sure whether I got them all as I
had some rejects; I ended up with a version 1.00 driver as at:
http://the.earth.li/~noodles/hpt366.c
Is there somewhere I can get your latest work without having to try to
pick the right patches from the l-k archives?
Also I'm getting fairly appalling speeds; I don't know if this is thie
card or not, but I have a SATA II capable drive (I know the controller
 is only SATA I) attached that's getting detected as:
hde: 488397168 sectors (250059 MB) w/16384KiB Cache, CHS=30401/255/63, UDMA(33)
I'd expect UDMA(133) or similar instead? hdparm -Tt gives:
/dev/sda:
 Timing cached reads:   984 MB in  2.00 seconds = 491.58 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:   90 MB in  3.00 seconds =  30.00 MB/sec
/dev/hda:
 Timing cached reads:   940 MB in  2.00 seconds = 469.89 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  172 MB in  3.04 seconds =  56.66 MB/sec
/dev/hde:
 Timing cached reads:   1012 MB in  2.01 seconds = 504.48 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:   44 MB in  3.05 seconds =  14.43 MB/sec
(sda is an old 36GB SCSI disk on an Adaptec 2940, hda is a Maxtor on the
internal VIA PATA controller. I'd expected hde to at least outperform
sda.)
Relevent dmesg output is:
HPT372A: IDE controller at PCI slot 0000:00:09.0
