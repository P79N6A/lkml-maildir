Indeed.
Just to close a rather pointless debate: my original posting was not
an attempt at self-congratulation, but merely to point out that the
assumption made by a previous poster that MIT can and does flount US
law is not a sound argument on which to base any kernel policy
changes. I should perhaps have worded things more carefully...
Cheers,
