(Clarifying:  the ACPI *code* works that way.  I have no idea whether
ACPI itself makes such restrictions.  And I suspect that ACPI practice
will in some cases couple multiple ACPI devices to one PCI device...)

Could you elaborate a bit ... what do you mean by "merge"?
One way to merge the trees would be to relocate
	/sys/devices/pci* --> ... this *HAS* a PNP node
	/sys/devices/pnp*/X --> /sys/devices/acpi_system*/.../X
Not having the PCI root be its PNPACPI node seems more buglike
to me than anything else.  And for other nodes, it seems like
maybe there should be a "firmware" subdirectory holding the
ACPI state (hid, path, etc) ... creating a minor chicken/egg
problem that ACPI would need to sort out.  Likely one can just
assume PCI and PNP busses exist, so creating nodes on those
buses based on ACPI tables would not be a problem.  And for
ACPI-internal devices, like SLPB and power buttons, the ACPI
bus would suffice.  But are there other busses?
