Jens just sent me an updated version of his IDE barrier code, and I'm
adding support for reiserfs and ext3 to it this weekend.  It's fairly
trivial to add support for each FS, I just don't know the critical
sections of the others as well.
The SUSE 2.4 kernels have had various forms of the patch, it took us a
while to get things right.  It does impact performance slightly, since
we are forcing cache flushes that otherwise would not have been done.
The common workloads don't slow down with the patch, fsync heavy
workloads typically lose around 10%.
