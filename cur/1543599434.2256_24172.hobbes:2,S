This is the correct approach, I think. Have you tried adding the two
setsockopt() calls after the bind, or at the very least the
IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP one, to see if you can Rx? Otherwise quite obviously
your physical interface will not have the multicast MAC address added to
its filters and no packets will reach the IP stack.
'ip maddr ls' is a useful tool for inspecting what your NIC is letting
through.
