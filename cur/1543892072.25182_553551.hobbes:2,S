While I understand, there are a few users who will have problems with
this default are we really better to not provide this defense in depth
for the majority of users and let those with problems turn it off rather
than provide no defense by default?  I could even provide a different
default for SELinux and non-SELinux if anyone saw value in that?  But if
others think that off default is  best I'll send another patch shortly
with the unsigned long fix and the default set to 0.  My hope is then
that distros will figure out to turn this on.
