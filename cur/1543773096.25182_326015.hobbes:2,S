 There's another point actually -- if a memory location (here meaning a 
single entity covered by ECC; usually a 32-bit word or a 64-bit 
doubleword) is causing SBEs excessively, then a bit there probably 
somewhat less reliable due to wear, damage, etc.  But the normal memory 
error statistics apply to other bits at that location as usually, so now 
the probability of an MBE is greater.  So you'd better keep your data 
away.

 Certainly.

 But as I mentioned you have to be careful not to switch the MBE interrupt 
off as a side effect.  Actually the overhead for handling the interrupt 
shouldn't be that high, unless the error triggers in the handler itself.

 Starting with synchronous reporting when possible. :-)
