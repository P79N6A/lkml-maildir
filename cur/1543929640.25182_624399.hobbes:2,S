I am sorry, i don't understand how this is related to the semantics of e.g. longjmp.
But, i am sure my patch solves all overflows. Ingo's patch can't catch the overflow 
which is caught by "int i[1000];" in the handler function.
Do you have more idea for me? Thanks.

By the way, I think Ingo's patch can be improved.
