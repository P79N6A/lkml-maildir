Before suspending I power down the backlight with "radeontool light off"
and with 2.6.11 the display is properly restored. With 2.6.12rc2 the
backlight remains switched off and if I switch it on with radeontool it
becomes lighter, but there's still no text from the fbcon, just the blank
screen.

Can you tell me which function you have in mind, so that I can insert
some printks to see how often it's called?
