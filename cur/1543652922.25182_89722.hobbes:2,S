The problem we have here is that all "versions" share the same set of
components -- and therefore, the same set of component owners.  So if
we just create another version, say "2.5-ac", then we would not be able
to assign Alan Cox to the components belonging to this version because
there is only one set of components shared by all versions.
A way to get around this is to create 3-level component list (as opposed
to 2-level currently: category and components).  This 3-level component
list would go like this:
Product --> Category --> Component
whereas
Product = 2.5-linus, 2.5-ac, etc.
Category = same as currently
Component = same as currently
What this does is that each product (2.5-linus, 2.5-ac, etc) would have
its *own* set of categories and components.  This way we could assign all
categories and components under product 2.5-ac to Alan, and all categories
and components under 2.5-linus to other maintainers.
We could then delete "Version" from the bug reports as it no longer means
anything much.
Or we could use the name "version" for "product" in the scheme I described
above.
