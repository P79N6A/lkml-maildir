Yes, because the software license that TiVo signed up for says that
TiVo must pass on certain rights and not impose any further
restrictions.
And all that because TiVo wanted to use kernel and userland that were
readily available, and at no cost other than respecting others'
freedoms, while at that?
Who's the lazy bum, again?

Just like they seem to think it's perfectly fine to ignore a number of
people who design and maintain the software they decided to use in
their hardware.

Good.  How about thinking of the users, the customers of your dear
friends too?  The ones who might be contributing much more to your
project.
Then look how what you said in the paragraph before about RIAA/MPAA
applies to what TiVO is doing to the software, and realize that you're
accusing us of doing what the party you support does.
I'm not trying to impose anything.  I'm not pushing anything.  I'm
defending the GPLv3 from accusations that it's departing from the GPL
spirit, and I'm trying to find out in what way Tivoization promotes
the goals you perceive as good for Linux, that make GPLv2
advantageous.  So far, you haven't given any single reason about this.
You talked about tit-for-tat, you said anti-Tivoization in GPLv3 was
bad, but you don't connect the dots.  Forgive if I get the impression
that you're just fooling yourself, and misguiding a *lot* of people
out there in the process.
