Subject: Oops on 2.2.17 [klogd bonus question]

Hi.
I'm getting oopses on a linux 2.2.17 box when I try to do
tar cvIf <file> -X<file> /. Reproducably. This works fine 
for the std. RH 6.2 kernel (2.2.14-5). The resulting file 
is about 20MB.
I would submit the oops, but it is run through klogd and
I seem to remember people expressing dissatisfaction 
with klogd. So what do I do now to get a usable oops
to submit?
Regards,
  Rasmus
