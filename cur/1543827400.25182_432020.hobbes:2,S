We'll use fb_restore_state and fb_save_state if available, yes, but I don't
think we need to implement unbind and bind.  For one, as Jon and Andrew
has pointed out, drivers should have no concept of binding. (That's why the
patch has escalated to VT binding).
And why force drivers to have an fb_restore_state/fb_save_state just to
unbind/bind?  This is going to penalize 10's of drivers that don't need
it.  Just make this feature an experimental kconfig option, or make this
available as a boot option.
This feature is in a state of flux, so this is definitely not its final
form, nor the last one in a series.  The main goal here is to make the fbdev
system synchronize with other tools/modules whether it be for state
preservation, assistance on mode setting, etc. We need this if we are going
to make the different architectures work together.
