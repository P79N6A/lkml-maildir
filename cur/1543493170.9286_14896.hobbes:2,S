Peeter,
I've attached a wrapper program that should allow this and only this.
Without filesystem capabilities (2.3 stuff), you'll have to make do with
some sort of wrapper. You'll need to make this wrapper setuid root.
[morgan@morgan-home olx]$ strace -p 189
attach: ptrace(PTRACE_ATTACH, ...): Operation not permitted
[morgan@morgan-home olx]$ strace_all -p 189
bash: strace_all: command not found
[morgan@morgan-home olx]$ ./strace_all -p 189
oldselect(20, [4 5], NULL, NULL, NULL
(Take a look at /proc/<strace_all_pid>/status to convince yourself that
this works.)
Cheers
Andrew
PS. I'm at a loss to say what has happened to the FAQ. Astor?
