That's interesting. Could you double check that you run 2.4.0-test11
and not 2.4.0-test12preX? There has been at least one reports of this
very bug and two others that look related. However, it looked like a
test12-pre[34] problem - until now.

The compiler version you are using is always an interesting data point.
But I doubt that this is the problem here.
