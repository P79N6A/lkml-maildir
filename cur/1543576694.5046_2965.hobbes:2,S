The code assumes that every page which has the PG_dirty
bit set also has page->mapping set to a valid value.
The BUG() people are getting confirms that this assumption
is not necessarily true and the VM work that's going on will
most likely make it not be true either in some cases.
The (trivial) patch below should fix this problem.
Linus and/or Alan, could you please apply this for the next
pre-patch ?
regards,
Rik
