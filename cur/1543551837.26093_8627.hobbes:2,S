   However, from the time the command is issued until the cache is
   actually cleared is two whole seconds.  I would have expected it to
   be essentially instantaneous.
   Does anyone know why this is taking so long and maybe how I could
   speed it up?
The flush is always run during a periodic timer, you're just seeing
when it fires ;-)
