It depends on the implementation obviously, but its typically something like
	take lock
	writew(port&0xFFFF, port&0xFFFF0000);
	writew(data, port&0xFFFF0000+1);
	drop lock
Assuming you can drop the bridges on 64K boundaries in pci mem space, or
one extra deref and a register load if not.
Can you give me an idea of what sort of cookie decoding a PPC/PMac would need
and why - Im working off things like pa-risc so I dont have a full picture.
