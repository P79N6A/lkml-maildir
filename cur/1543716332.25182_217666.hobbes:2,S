You have argued this a lot of times during this thread and I want to say
smoenthing about that. I have used some binary-only modules: nvidia,
vmware and some time ago HSF drivers. When I installed the nvidia
propetary driver was the first time I saw the word 'tainted' and it
makes sense: I was at the console.
I mean that most of users work on X (except when installing X drivers
:)) and probably they will never see this "confusing" warnings.
When my system boots, it loads the nvidia and vmware modules and most of
time (I could say always) I don't notice that my kernel is tainted
(though I know) so I don't see the reason to hide the license.
I think it should be good for all to stop flaming and put some things in
order. You have lied about the license and it seems you want to keep
lying so -quoting Linus- it seems you don't have shame.
Cheers,
