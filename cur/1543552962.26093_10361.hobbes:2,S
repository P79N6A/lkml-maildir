* 2.91.66 aka egcs 1.1.2.  It has been officially blessed for 2.4 and
  has been given an informal thumbs-up by Alan for 2.2.  (It does NOT
  work for 2.0, if you still care about that.)
* 2.7.2.3 works for 2.2 (and 2.0) but NOT for 2.4.
* 2.95.2 seems to work with both 2.2 and 2.4 (no known bugs, AFAIK) and
  many of us use it, but it is a little riskier than egcs.
* Red Hat "2.96" or CVS 2.97 will probably break any known kernel.
