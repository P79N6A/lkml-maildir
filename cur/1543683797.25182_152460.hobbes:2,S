hi all,
I have a problem compiling 2.6.0-test1, and later 2.6.0-test2.
booting the kernel goes well, but when i try to log in my system,
keyboard seems to be crazy, and when i press a key, it writes the same
key for almost 4 times, so it is very impossible log in.
/var/log/syslog don't seems to have something strange.
my system is a laptop hp pavilion ze4200, lspci tells me:
