And this is why the kernel _has_ to save the FP state.
It's the "only happens in a blue moon" bugs that are the absolute _worst_ 
bugs. I want to optimize the kernel until I'm blue in the face, but the 
kernel must NEVER EVER have a "non-stable" interface.
Signal handlers that don't restore state are hard as _hell_ to debug. Most 
of the time it doesn't really matter (unless the lack of restore is 
something really major like one of the most common integer registers), but 
then depending on what libraries you use, and just _exactly_ when the 
signal comes in, you get subtle data corruption that may not show up until 
much later.
At which point your programmer wonders if he mistakenly wandered into 
MS-Windows land.
No thank you. I'll take slow signal handlers over ones that _sometimes_ 
don't work.

On purpose, yes. It's ok to take careful aim, and say "I'm now shooting 
myself in the foot".
And yes, it's also ok to say "I don't know what I'm doing, so I may be
shooting myself in the foot" (this is obviously the most common
foot-shooter).
And if you come to me and complain about how drunk you were, and how you 
shot yourself in the foot by mistake due to that, I'll just ignore you.
BUT - and this is a big BUT - if you are doing everything right, and you 
actually know what you're doing, and you end up shooting yourself in the 
foot because the kernel was taking a shortcut, then I think the kernel is 
_wrong_.
And I'd rather have a slow kernel that does things right, than a fast 
kernel which screws with people.

That would be extremely interesting especially with signal handlers that 
do a longjmp() thing.
The real fix for a lot of programs on x86 would be for them to never ever 
use FP in the first place, in which case the kernel would be able to just 
not save and restore it at all.
However, glibc fiddles with the fpu at startup, even for non-FP programs. 
Dunno what to do about that.
