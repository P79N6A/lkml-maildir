Only a tiny fraction of all C programs are fully ANSI C compliant.  Many
"hello world" programs are not.  The linux kernel already is highly
compliant, but in many places "must" use impliementation defined
features of the compiler.  The digital unix kernel is the same way, it
only compiles with the DEC cc compiler.
    The issue involved in this case is not in fact the linux kernel not
being compiant.  It is the fact the kernel needs to do something the
standard does not support.  There was a long discussion on comp.std.c
about this in which Linus asked for a standard way of doing this get
added to C9x.  YOu can read the archivies on www.deja.com.
