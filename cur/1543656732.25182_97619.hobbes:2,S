Try leaving interactive_delta at 2.  If there are still issues, then it
may just be the normal "lack" of interactivity bonus.  A heavy compile
is never pleasant to the other applications.
You could also try Andrew's numbers (max_timeslice=10 and
prio_bonus_rate=0 or 10), but I would prefer not to decrease
max_timeslice so much.
