You have a very wrapped sense of kernel bloat. This is nine lines of
code whose absence is guaranteed to generate a bunch of bug reports.
Not having it is also causing various implementers to implement
attribute processing differently. Some are stripping white space in
their implementations and some are not. If you want to attack kernel
bloat there are much more productive areas.
If whitespace cleanup is rejected I believe we should eliminate text
based sysfs attributes in general and make them all binary. I'll
probably remove the fbdev sysfs interface because I don't want to deal
with the bug reports reporting the same problem over and over.
