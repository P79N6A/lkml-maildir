29 packages (out of 3123) contain the string linux/ext2_fs.h.
Most of them test for either ext2fs/ext2_fs.h or linux/ext2_fs.h.
The following have linux/ext2_fs.h hardcoded:
pam_mktemp-1.0.3
sash-3.7
socat-1.6.0.1
arcboot-0.3.2 (for mips dvhtool)
All of them can be fixed.
I suggest to drop that header.
