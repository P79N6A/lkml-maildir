Why so? Last I looked, Linux could run native binaries for:
ia32:		BSD, Solaris, SCO SVR3, UnixWare V7, random others...
Alpha:		Digital Unix
SPARC:		SunOS, Solaris
SPARC64:	Solaris
MIPS:		IRIX
Also, with the assistance of a user-space emulator, we can run some more:
ARM:		RiscOS
Alpha:		Linux/ia32
And perhaps you could even count wine and dosemu.
What makes you think that Monterey apps won't be fairly quickly added to that 
list?
