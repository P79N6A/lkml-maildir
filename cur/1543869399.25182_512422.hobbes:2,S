No, there isn't.

Let's see...  ENOENT and ECONNRESET indicate the URB was unlinked, so you
probably don't want to resubmit it.  EPIPE indicates a problem on the 
device end, so you would want to fix the problem before resubmitting (at 
the very least you would want to clear the halt).  EOVERFLOW is 
questionable; if the device sent too much data once then it might do so 
again.  Ditto for EREMOTEIO (the device sent too little data).  ENODEV 
means the device was removed, so you definitely don't want to resubmit.
