Here, we have syscall() with first argument being the system call number
- so what you suggested is not correct.
But, yes, the synopsis should change at some time. Maybe to something
like:
	#include <fcntl.h>
	long fallocate(int fd, int mode, loff_t offset, loff_t len);

Will add following errors:
  EINTR		A signal was caught during execution
  EIO		An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to
		a file system.
  EOPNOTSUPP	The mode is not supported on the file descriptor.
and will update following :
  EINVAL	offset was less than 0, or len was less than or equal to 0.
