It seems you answered "yes" to
  Code maturity level options
    Prompt for development and/or incomplete code/drivers
and "no" to
  Code maturity level options
    Prompt for development and/or incomplete code/drivers
      Select only drivers expected to compile cleanly
If you say "yes" to second question, you won't be able to select drivers 
that don't compile.
