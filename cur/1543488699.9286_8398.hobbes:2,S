i'm about to look into porting 2.[23].x to mk. i think it may be hard
to keep everything in an arch, though. the current mk 2.0.x has
#ifdef's all over the place. i wasn't around when 2.0.x was ported, so
i'm not sure how difficult it would be to port linux again.
the idea of a mach aware pvm lib has been talked about, btw. i don't
think anyone's actually working on it, though.
