Hi,
FYI, building 2.6.22-rc2 with
gcc (GCC) 4.1.3 20070514 (prerelease) (Debian 4.1.2-7)
on my powerbook (PPC) gives:
...
kernel/time/ntp.c: In function 'do_adjtimex':
kernel/time/ntp.c:307: warning: comparison of distinct pointer types lacks a cast
kernel/time/ntp.c:310: warning: comparison of distinct pointer types lacks a cast
...
If more info is needed, please contact me via PM, as I am not
subscribed.
Thanks for your patience
Elimar
