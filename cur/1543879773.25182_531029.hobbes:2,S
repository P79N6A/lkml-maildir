Can we get few lines in Documentation? I guess min_capacity is
shutdown capacity at current temperature, but its surely non-obvious.
Will min_capacity increase as batery gets old? Or will max_capacity
decrease? (Should we introduce design_capacity for ACPI systems that
know the difference?)
What is min_current? Granularity of amper meter?
And min_voltage is shutdown voltage?
Otherwise it looks good to me. Something like this is really needed.

Perhaps we need STATUS_ERROR? At least on some machines it is
different from STATUS_NOT_CHARGING.

#ifdefs need to be at column 0?
