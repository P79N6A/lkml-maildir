There is something in the sparc tree, which is used also for sun4c and sun4d
(where there is only 64MB of DMA per board, so one has to remap DMA areas
during runtime).
Besically, each driver before it starts doing dma uses some function which
translates virtual address + length to dma address and allocates it, then
after the dma the driver has to release it again.
Martin Mares and myself are considering this as part of the new buses
interface we plan for 2.3. The Ultra port supports even now huge amounts of
memory, but uses bounce buffers for that. I plan to change it in early 2.3.
Cheers,
    Jakub
