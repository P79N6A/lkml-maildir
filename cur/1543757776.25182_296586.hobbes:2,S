No. It has nothing to do with the architecture. These problems go
all the way back to the first multi-tasking systems.

It's not the "task" that's hung. That's just the symptoms. It's
the SHARED RESOURCE that is hung!  Once some task attempts
to use a shared resource, it must (somehow) get in-line so
that the it can use that task without somebody else coming
along and mucking with it. To get "in-line" means to
execute some kind of MUTEX. There are many kinds. VAXen
had a "lock manager", there are simple sleeping-loops using
semaphores, etc. Linux uses such loops, the two most
commonly used are "down()" and "up()".
Now, somebody needs a resource. It executes down(&semaphore);
once it gets control again, it has that resource. It attempts
to use that resource through a driver. The driver waits forever.
The resource is now permanently dorked --forever because its
driver is waiting forever. The user code never returns from
the driver so it can never execute up(&semaphore).
If you, somehow, grab hold of the program-counter (like
a long-jump), and force a return so that up(&semaphore) gets
executed, the wrong thread unlocks the semaphore but its
forever broken anyway because the resource it protects is
hung.

Time won't do it. It's not a matter of "cleaning up" it's a matter
of not waiting forever in the first place. If you were able to
"clean up" by reinitializing the semaphores, etc., killing anything
that was attached,  etc., the next instance of attempting to use
that resource will hang the exact same way.
We are not talking about some broken semaphore code that sometimes
gets hung. We are talking about the resource it protects. The
semaphore code is fine.

The problem is not "Waiting in D state". That's the symptom.
The problem is waiting forever after a lock has been taken.
That is the problem.
