IIRC the physical DESTMOD in the IO-APIC's RTE's is not essential,
just somewhat more optimal given generalized node affinity. It also
dodged the need for infrastructure to associate various kinds of
devices with nodes in the 2.4.x timeframe.
Dumping small tidbits of decision-making and destination formatting
into headers that can be swizzled across subarches somehow would be ideal.
Thanks,
Bill
