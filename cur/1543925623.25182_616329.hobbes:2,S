I was thinking of simply a chain of dma_ops (via dma_ops->prev_ops) ,
where it's the responsibility of each dma_ops implementation to call
or not call the corresponding entry in chain (prev_ops->op()). This
works well for Calgary (which will only use prev_ops selectively, and
I think it will work well for the IB folks. Will it work for you?
