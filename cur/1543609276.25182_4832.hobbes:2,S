I had a drive that did something this (it was really slow on reads and 
normal speed on writes, funnily enough).  I finally compared it to
another drive in the same machine which worked normally and decided
that it was a failing drive (after trying many different kernels).
The replacement works fine.
So don't rule out hardware, either a bad drive or an incompatibility
between your drive and your IDE controller.

A less arrogant tone would be a good start.
