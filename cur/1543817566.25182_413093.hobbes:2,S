Well, with 0x101, the hardware is telling us "device presence detected, 
but phy communications not yet established"
So, my first instinct would be to look at __mv_phy_reset() code block 
just above the comment /* work around errata */, and increase the length 
of the timeout from 200ms to 1-5 seconds.
My second instinct would be to increase the number of retries from 5.
