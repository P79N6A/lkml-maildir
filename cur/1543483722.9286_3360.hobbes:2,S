You should probably netmask 255.255.255.255 on ifconfig. That, or ifconfig
should default to that netmask automagically if you specify point to point.
Or the kernel should default to that netmask when you set up a point to
point interface / device.
One wrong solution would probably be something like the following:

(Utterly untested of course - I don't claim to have really understood any
of the stuff in net/ipv4/fib_*.c)
As I said, probably conceptually wrong (as well as the code probably being
wrong) -- but if it keeps people quiet?
