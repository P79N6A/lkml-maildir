Just a filesystem or Pre-Database :-)
Databases have mandatory transaction management. Means if process A
accesses data fields process B has to wait till A finished (except both do
reads only). On some better databases you may work around transaction
management - as on better filesystems you may activate transaction
management (by locking files).
Short:
		standard		optional
Database	t.m. is active		can be downsized (or even switched
					off)
Filesystem	t.m. is inactive	can be _emulated_
Not that I ever wanted mandatory t.m.... but I remember an angry professor
who didn't like the idea of filesystems compared with databases - don't
run into the same trouble :-)
	happy hacking (on things more important than "real databases"),
	Konrad
