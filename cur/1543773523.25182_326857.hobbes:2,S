Again, good stuff!
It looks to me that I-PIPE is an example of a "nested OS", with
Linux nested within the I-PIPE functionality.  One could take
the RTAI-Fusion approach, but this measurement is of I-PIPE
rather than RTAI-Fusion, right?  (And use of RTAI-Fusion might
or might not change these results significantly, just trying to
make sure I understand what these specific tests apply to.)
Also, if I understand correctly, the interrupt latency measured
is to the Linux kernel running within I-PIPE, rather than to I-PIPE
itself.  Is this the case, or am I confused?
						Thanx, Paul
