Theoretically, yes. The signature is 2048bit and to validate the signed 
aggregate requires recursively applying SHA1 over all measurements.

We implemented some exemplary IMA-applications. If you like, visit our 
project page and check out the references:
http://www.research.ibm.com/secure_systems_department/projects/tcglinux/
There you also find a complete  measurement list and a response of a measured 
system replying to an authorized remote measurement-list-request.
Thanks
Reiner
