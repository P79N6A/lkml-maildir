Ramon,
NWFS has a very good Asynch IO API for Linux AIO.  You can get the code
at 207.109.151.240.  I already handle all the buffer head allocations
and returns and locking issues with the Linux kernel.  The file block.c
has generic functions for all Linux versions 2.0/2.2/2.4 with a
consistent asynch IO interface that runs across all Linuxes.  The code
is all GPL, so you can pull it apart and use it anyway you want.
:-)
