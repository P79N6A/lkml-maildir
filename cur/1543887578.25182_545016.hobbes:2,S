        select VIDEO_BUF
        select VIDEO_TUNER
        select VIDEO_TVEEPROM
        select VIDEO_IR
        select VIDEO_SAA711X if VIDEO_HELPER_CHIPS_AUTO
        select VIDEO_TVP5150 if VIDEO_HELPER_CHIPS_AUTO

          This is a video4linux driver for Empia 28xx based TV cards.
          To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the  
          module will be called em28xx
The first line does it.  It's not a dependency, it's a direct select.
And drivers/media/video/Makefile has
obj-$(CONFIG_VIDEO_BUF)   += video-buf.o
