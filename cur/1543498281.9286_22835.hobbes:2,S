It works now, thanks.

Could someone please tell me the typical size of the buffer cache in big
real world servers?
An average bucketsize of 1 is too much for the average desktop but it may
indeed help for servers.  It seems there should be a config option:
  "[*] Optimize for big buffer caches"     --> avg bucket zize = 1
                                          else avg bucket size = 4
And for 386/486 there should be a shift/add hashfn. On a 486 it takes 40
cycles for one multiplication and it would be nice to still support these
old PCs.
