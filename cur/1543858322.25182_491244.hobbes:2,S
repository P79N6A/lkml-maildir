Why?  X does it today :)

Yes, and because of this, they create binary only drivers today.  Lots
of them.  All over the place.  Doing crazy stupid crap in kernelspace.
Then there are people who do irq stuff in userspace but get it wrong.
I've seen that happen many times in lots of different research papers
and presentations.
This interface does it correctly, and it allows those people who for
some reason feel they do want to keep their logic in non-gpl code, to do
it.
It also allows code that needs floating point to not be in the kernel
and in one instance using this interface actually sped up the device
because of the lack of the need to go between kernel and userspace a
bunch of times.

Again, X does this today, and does does lots of other applications.
This is a way to do it in a sane manner, to keep people who want to do
floating point out of the kernel, and to make some embedded people much
happier to use Linux, gets them from being so mad at Linux because we
keep changing the internal apis, and makes me happier as they stop
violating my copyright by creating closed drivers in the kernel.
thanks,
