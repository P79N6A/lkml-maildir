Subject: [PATCH -mm 2/2] Reintroduce write_trylock_irqsave()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/10/457

Reintroduce the new write_trylock_irqsave() implementation: slightly faster,
less invasive and similar in style to the implementation of
spin_trylock_irqsave() in mainline and -mm.
