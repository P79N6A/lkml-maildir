Yoshifuji is 100% correct, IMNSHO.
Please, this is _basic_ refcounting semantics. For those who disagree,
kindly read Yoshifuji's above paragraph again.

Yes, it is, of course. Allowing xxx_put(NULL) to succeed (without any
warnings/oops) is *absolutely* nonsensical, and can *only* occur if the
caller (or worse, the API itself) is buggy in the first place (i.e. does not
use proper locking and/or refcounting).
I can't believe it should be so difficult to understand this. How can any
caller (that first did a xxx_get() on that shared object) land up with that
object getting NULL _from under it_ unless some logic is wrong
somewhere? And instead of flagging this broken logic, the proposed
change here would hide it.
Worse, if that object did become NULL between the _get() and _put()
code, then we'll have an oops (which would be even more difficult to
debug now) anyway.

Don't {mis}quote the kfree() mistake here, please.

This can only mean two things:
(1) Either, they simply do not _need_ the refcounting in the first place
(which means -- better do away with get() and put() for them altogether)
(2) Or, all that code / APIs are so horribly misdesigned and/or buggy that
you're now having to hide that by allowing NULL arguments in get() and
put() functions (which means -- fix the bugs, please)

Ok, what's the compelling reason to change sysfs_put() then?
I don't see any, either.
