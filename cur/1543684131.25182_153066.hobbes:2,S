FWIW, the problems my Dell Latitude had with the external
mice I use with it were significantly reduced once I added
"psmouse_noext" to the kernel's command line. That one
change eliminated all lost sync messages and general craziness
after resumes from suspended state.
To make the mouse move at proper speed w/o jerkiness I
also had to tweak the rate and scaling programmed into it
to match 2.4 defaults. (rate 100, scale 2:1)
In fairness, only my old Latitude has these PS/2 issues.
