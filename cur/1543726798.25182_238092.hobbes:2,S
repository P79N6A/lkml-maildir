Use the SG_IO interface, it should be the default if you just specify
dev=/dev/hdc instead of faking some SCSI like device enumeration for
ATAPI.

If you read the above, it was about 2.4 and using ide-cd instead of
ide-scsi there. In 2.6 you have two options outside of ide-scsi: one is
the CDROM_SEND_PACKET (which is what the dev=ATAPI:1,1,0 above used)
which works in both 2.4 and 2.6, but is absolutely crap and not
recommended. The other is the SG_IO method, which is the recommended
approach.
