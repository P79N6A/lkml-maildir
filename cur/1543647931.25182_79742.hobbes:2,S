These changes cannot go in:
1) There is no reason the 'okfn' you use cannot be the
   function doing the MAC header copy.
   This is how this is supposed to work.
   I explained in that long thread a few weeks ago how
   this copy may not be placed in the generic IP code.
   This is final, you must find a way to make this copy
   without touching ipv4/*.c
2) The netfilter changes need to be approved by the netfilter
   team.
   I suspect, like myself, they will barf at the phys{in,out}dev
   additions to sk_buff.  We already have enough junk sitting
   in sk_buff making it larger than it needs to be.
   Perhaps you can hang this off the nf_conntrack pointer and
   specify a destructor.
3) The bridging layer changes need to be approved by Lennert.
   But I'd suggest working out #1 and #2 first.
Thanks.
