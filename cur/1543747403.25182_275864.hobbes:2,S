Subject: OHCI1394:sleeping function called from invalid context [need idea for fixing]

I am trying to debug  a problem with the OHCI1394 module. Basically i get "sleeping function called from invalid context" in dmesg whenever I capture video from my camcorder. Looking at the stack trace - dma_pool_create is called from within IRQ handler - or so it seems. Similarly the ohci1394 module also calls dma_pool_destroy in IRQ. This happens when I connect and disconnect the camcorder.
I am thinking of ways to fix this - and have no clue so far. I fixed couple other similar but easy-to-fix ones in ohci1394.c - by changing from GFP_KERNEL to GFP_ATOMIC but this one looks more complicated - DMA Pool needs to be freed when device disconnects - how to do this outside of the IRQ? More complicated (to me of course :) is the allocaction part - driver needs a DMA pool on device connect - no idea how to get it outside of the IRQ path.
Can anyone give an idea how to go about fixing this? Normally what's the correct place for a module to call dma_pool_create/destroy?
Below is a sample stack trace -
Parry.
