Probably a hang over from a version where the units were proportion of a 
whole machine.  Percentage doesn't work very well if there are more than 
1 CPU in that case (especially if there are more than 100 CPUs :-)). 
But it's also useful to have the extra range if your trying to cap 
processes (or users) from outside the scheduler using these primitives.

It's not meant to imply accuracy :-).  The main issue is avoiding 
overflow when doing the multiplications during the comparisons.
