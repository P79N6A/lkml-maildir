Something like that. But it should be hidden within a suitable 
abstraction. get_user_pages and then put_page is not stateful enough. 
Actually it's fundamentally broken for platform that need cache flush 
calls. create_page_mapping/free_page_mapping, or something like that.
And I still think that the initial implementation should copy the 
affected pages within fork() - it might be slow, but at least it's 
simple and correct. _If_ it's too slow, then it can be fixed later.
