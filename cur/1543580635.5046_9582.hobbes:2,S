I personaly think that Ben's function pointer on wakeup work is the alternative in
this area.

I have never said that they don't like it - but having both the waitqueue and the
completion handler in the kiobuf makes it bigger.

Yes, this would be THE alternative to my suggestion.

It doesn't really matter that much, because we write to the pagecache
first anyway.
The real thing is that we want to have some common data structure for
describing physical memory used for IO.  We could either use special
structures in every subsystem and then copy between them or pass
struct page * and lose meta information.  Or we could try to find a
structure that holds enough information to make passing it from one
subsystem to another usefull.  The cut-down kio design (heavily inspired
by Larry McVoy's splice paper) should allow just that, nothing more an
nothing less.  For use in disk-io and networking or v4l there are probably
other primary data structures needed, and that's ok.
