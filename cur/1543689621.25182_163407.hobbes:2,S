Because assembler is such a pain. :)
In general, you don't want any code to be in assembler, so it is your
duty to prove that this is a valid exception.

Again, that is your job.  It is faster and smaller on Athlon, good.
How about i386?  Does it even run on that machine?  If not, you need
Kconfig to make sure it isn't compiled in for i386.  Repeat for all
other platforms.
Repeat for all the other cpus.

Ok, that is good.  It might still be bigger, depending on the target
cpu, but that is unlikely.

It is.  You code should at least survive test runs against a different
implementation to make sure the good case is working correctly.  I
guess you have done it, but have you really?  Didn't tell us yet.

I'm not sure about the rest of the kernel either, but I have a much
better feeling.  The encryption implementations in the kernel were
based on existing and tested code, got some more testing, were
reviewed by several people...
If noone else ever went over your code, I will assume there are some
security holes left and a machine using that code is at least
vulnerable to local users.  This may still be ok, but it should be
noted in BIG LETTERS: DANGEROUS.

Sorry, I don't feel like going through intel assembler in nasm syntax
in my free time, especially if I have to go and fetch the code myself.
Your idea looks promising - the reason why I bother to answer at all -
but if it should go in, it still needs a lot of work.  The fun part is
finished, you are 20% done. ;)
