Hi Linus,
This series of four patches are the first step towards making NO_IRQ a
pervasive concept.  It's bundled up in a git tree for your convenience
(unless I bodged it up, in which case it's your inconvenience).
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/willy/misc-2.6.git no_irq
 - Check the irq number is within bounds in the functions which weren't
   already checking.
 - Introduce PCI_NO_IRQ and pci_valid_irq()
   Explicitly initialise pci_dev->irq with PCI_NO_IRQ, allowing us to change
   the value of PCI_NO_IRQ when all drivers have been audited.
 - Use pci_valid_irq() instead of a custom NO_IRQ definition.
   It probably didn't work on half a dozen architectures.
 - Move the definition of NO_IRQ from asm directories to <linux/hardirq.h>.
   Individual architectures can still override it if they want to, but all
   existing definitions were -1.

I'll follow this mail with the patches for other peoples benefits.  They
were previously posted to linux-arch with no responses.
