You only got stack overflows when working with kgdb right? 
Sounds like a kgdb problem to me then that can and should be probably fixed. e.g. 
afaik kgdb isn't reentrant anyways so it could just use static buffers.
I would suggest against adding any new config options for this - it would
conflict with the great goal of having loadable debuggers that work
on any kernels.
