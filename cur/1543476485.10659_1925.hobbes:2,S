Can you run pre6+zlatko with just the mm/page_alloc.c one-liner reverted
to pre5? That is, take pre6+zlatko, and just change 
	try_to_free_pages(gfp_mask, freepages.high - nr_free_pages);
back to
	try_to_free_pages(gfp_mask, SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX);
That particular one-liner was almost certainly a mistake, it was done on
the mistaken assumption that the clustering problem was due to
insufficient write-time clustering - while zlatko found that it was
actually due to fragmentation in the swap area. With zlatkos patch, the
original SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX is probably better and almost certainly results
in smoother behaviour due to less extreme free_pages..
