Didn't help, and -rc4-mm1 has the same problem.
Also tried with CONFIG_ACPI=n and with cardbus disabled, no change.
Added a few debug lines to the module:
sonypi_call1(82) enter
sonypi command failed at drivers/char/sonypi.c : sonypi_call1 (line 595)
sonypi_call1() leave
sonypi_call2(81, ff) enter
sonypi command failed at drivers/char/sonypi.c : sonypi_call2 (line 608)
sonypi command failed at drivers/char/sonypi.c : sonypi_call2 (line 610)
sonypi_call2() leave
sonypi_call1(82) enter
sonypi command failed at drivers/char/sonypi.c : sonypi_call1 (line 595)
sonypi_call1() leave
sonypi: Sony Programmable I/O Controller Driverv1.26.
sonypi: detected type2 model, verbose = 1, fnkeyinit = off, camera = off, compat = off, mask = 0xffffffff, useinput = off, acpi = on
sonypi: enabled at irq=11, port1=0x1080, port2=0x1084
sonypi: device allocated minor is 63
sonypi: setbluetoothpower enter
sonypi_call2(96, 00) enter
sonypi command failed at drivers/char/sonypi.c : sonypi_call2 (line 608)
sonypi command failed at drivers/char/sonypi.c : sonypi_call2 (line 610)
sonypi_call2() leave
sonypi_call1(82) enter
sonypi command failed at drivers/char/sonypi.c : sonypi_call1 (line 595)
sonypi_call1() leave
sonypi: setbluetoothpower leave
brightness for instance does not use the sonypi_callX() functions, and it works.
cat /dev/sonypi produces no more output either, and interrupt count for sonypi does
no longer increase when I press a hotkey or close the lid.
Thanks,
