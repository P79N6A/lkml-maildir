That's true; it should probably work.

Yes; and its downside (-EINTR even when the signal gets ignored) is
avoided by the above -- or just by using -ERESTARTNOHAND, in fact.
I think I'll use this approach, and probably use -ERESTARTNOHAND in the
first instance. Because ppoll() is going to take a timespec instead of
just an integer for the timeout, we can write back to it as we do for
select, and there shouldn't be a problem restarting. 
Thanks.
