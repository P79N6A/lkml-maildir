Subject: [rfc] i810_audio: offset LVI from CIV to avoid stalled start
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

"Some" OSS applications have trouble with later versions of the
i810_audio driver.  Wolfenstein Enemy Territory from idSoftware is
one such application.
I did a little legwork in BK and tracked-down the exact change which
caused the break.  The changelog comments are dismissive to the
original code.  However, I find that recreating a patch equivalent
to what was removed restores sound to the game.
Anyone have any suggestions for a patch that a) works; and, b)
accounts for the concerns expressed in the changelog?

P.S. Here is the problematic patch: (DO NOT TRY TO APPLY THIS)

#   [sound i810] remove bogus CIV_TO_LVI
#   
#   This patch removes a pair of bogus LVI assignments.  The explanation in
#   the comment is wrong because the value of PCIB tells the hardware that
#   the DMA buffer can be processed even if LVI == CIV.
#   
#   Setting LVI to CIV + 1 causes overruns when with short writes
#   (something that vmware is very fond of).
