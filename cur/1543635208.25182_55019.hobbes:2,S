Hi,
Not really a bug, but FYI, when turning off power to a Toshiba T4500, it seems to generate an NMI, and the value stored in 'reason', in arch/i386/kernel/traps.c is 20.  Maybe we could use this to do something interesting on power-down, (e.g. echo "goodbye" to the screen, (I really have no work to do today, do I?  :-) )).
John.
