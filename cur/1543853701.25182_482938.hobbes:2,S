I know. I'm refering to a DIMM that fails power-on diags or one
that is explicitly disabled from the system controller.
Clearly a reboot is required in both cases, but the end result is
a node with cpus and no memory. As I said earlier, the PROM (for several 
reasons) automatically the cpus on nodes w/o memory.
