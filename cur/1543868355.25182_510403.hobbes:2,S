Thanks! It's good to know we are headed in the right direction.

Hmm.. I guess it's space vs time then :-) A CPU controller could
control how much time is spent reclaiming ;)
Coming back, I see the problem you mentioned and we have been thinking
of several possible solutions. In my introduction I pointed out
    "Come up with cool page replacement algorithms for containers
    (if possible without any changes to struct page)"
The solutions we have looked at are
1. Overload the LRU list_head in struct page to have a global
    LRU + a per container LRU
+------+           prev       +------+
| page +--------------------->| page +---------
|  0   |<---------------------+  1   |<--------
+------+           next       +------+
                  Global LRU
             +------+
    +------- + prev |
    |        | next +-------------------------------------------+
    |        +------+                                           |
    V            ^                                              V
+------+        |  prev       +------+                     +------+
| page +        +------------ + page +---------.....       | page +
|  0   |--------------------->+  1   |<--------            |  n   |
+------+           next       +------+                     +------+
                  Global LRU + Container LRU
Page 1 and n belong to the same container, to get to page 0, you need
two de-references
2. Modify struct page to point to a container and allow each container to
    have a per-container LRU along with the global LRU
For efficiency we need the container LRU and we don't want to split
the global LRU either.
We need to optimize the reclaim path, but I thought of that as a secondary
problem. Once we all agree that the controller looks simple, accounts well
and works. We can/should definitely optimize the reclaim path.
