	Well, for some. :)  I don't think >>I'd<< mind it, but that's the
point, it'd be my choice (Or anyone else's).  In any case, symlinks could be
created to point to more simple names.  Or if possible devfs could just create
both, and let people make the choice.  I actually like devfs's naming scheme,
but I would really love to also have this other info somehow.  symlinks for
things in /dev to /kernel/devices... would work, because I could fgrep them.
	A simple text file mapping the long name to the controller number
would work, but not be as nice I don't think...
