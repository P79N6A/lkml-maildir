Hi,
My debian testing has gcc-4.0.3 and gcc-4.1.0 available.
I am using gcc-4.0.3 to compile the kernel but I was wondering if
there is a reason not to use gcc-4.1.0 ?
The computer is stable, no problems with compiling the kernel
with gcc-4.0.3.
Does anyone has good or bad experience and thus advice on it?
Best Regards,
Maciej
