afacit ext2 just forgets to run mark_page_accessed for directory pages
altogether, so it'll be equivalent to ext3 with that one-liner, I expect.
The directory pagecache on ext2 might get reclaimed faster because those
pages are eligible for reclaiming via the reclaim of their inodes, whereas
ext3's directories are in blockdev pagecache, for which the reclaim-via-inode
mechanism cannot happen.
I should do some testing with mmapped files.
