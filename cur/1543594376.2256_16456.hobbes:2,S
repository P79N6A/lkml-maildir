Under linux 2.4.1 if I move the mouse slow enough it doesn't register at all
in Xwindows. If I unplug the ps2 mouse and plug it back in, it works
perfectly, no matter how slowly I move it the movement is registered. It
is as if the linux kernel is imposing a threshold on the movement.
Under windows it works fine. The problem is in linux.
I've tried modifying pc_keyb.c code by sending an F6 byte to set defaults,
using the aux_write_ack function in open_aux(), but that doesn't have any
effect. Does anyone have a clue what the driver is doing to reduce the
quality of the mouse? I'm not sure it is limited to this particular mouse,
it is just the one I just bought at Fry's for $10.
I'm running an athlon 1 gig, /proc/version is
Linux version 2.4.1 (root@dave) (gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release)) #17 Fri Jun 15 20:15:45 PDT 2001
Thanks!
