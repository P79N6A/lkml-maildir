Hi, Ralf
Thanks for the reply.
I looked through kbuild documentation. This is
a variable called lib-y to build .a, for instance,
lib-y := a.o, b.o
Then lib.a will be produced. However, in this case,
you can build a lib.a for each sub module, but
they will have the same name, I don't know how you
can link them together.
I think the current kbuild system does simplify 
the Makefiles in 2.6, but it also reduces the
flexibility.
