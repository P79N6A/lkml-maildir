Thank you for your quick response!
But I failed to push i386 command-line size to more than 256 bytes...
You are right, it is required only for memory extreme devices...
Options:
1. Add COMMAND_LINE_SIZE to kernel config - was rejected because
kernel has already too much parameters, this was the initial patch
more than a year ago.
2. Just increase COMMAND_LINE_SIZE of i386, x86_64 - was rejected
because of it affecting low memory devices.
3. Convert the command-line into dynamically allocated buffers - this try.

Thank you, I was not aware of this.
I hope there will be no take 3 :)
