Ah there was a change to enable it on Core2. On AMD it was 
always there except on CPUs with RDTSCP
Anyways the very likely right way (I'm still waiting for final
confirmation from Intel) to solve this is to use LFENCE which
happens to stop RDTSC and is relatively light weight and won't
cause vmexits. Unfortunately that doesn't work on AMD, but 
there MFENCE happens to work. But there are more problems
in this code which I have a (.24) patchkit to fix.

You're right. The real roblem is that it is ring 0 only and that can
be executed in ring 3. That is why Ingo's patch was wrong too.
