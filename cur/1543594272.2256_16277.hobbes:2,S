Subject: [PATCH] Sound on Nautilus Alpha (UP1000, UP1100)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2001/6/14/180

Somehow a code which does Nautilus specific magic to a Trident card
was forgotten for cases when a "generic" Alpha kernel is in use.
After a transfer of these few lines from 2.2.19 my sound card started
to play again.  Nautilus specific kernel should work but this is
not always in use.
Header comments in trident.c indicate that "#define DRIVER_VERSION"
was simply forgotten so I updated that as well.
This patch was done with 2.4.5-ac13 but it should fit all trident.c
from 2.4 kernels possibly with some small line offsets.  Alan, will
you push that to Linus?
