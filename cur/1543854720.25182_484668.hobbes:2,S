Not much.  The only counterexample I know about just now is wanting
to use a UART.RX pin as a wakeup GPIO, even when the baud rate clock
is turned off during sleep ... only on development platforms.

Not entirely "mine" ... except in the writeup of the abstraction that's
already in wide use (with different syntax).
If we can agree on syntax, and factoring pin mux separately (however it
gets implemented) I think the immediate goal is satisfied.

It's realistic in a couple dozen different systems I've seen, including
ones using OMAP2.  Isn't that serious enough?  :)

I'm not quite sure what you're getting at with that any more, but so long
as you agree that it makes sense to have a GPIO API with more or less the
syntax I collected, distinct from pin mux/setup/reconfig, we're in close
enough agreement to move forward to whatever.
I know some folk say they "need" to remux after boot in non-exceptional cases,
but the ability to do that (or not) really seems like a separate discussion.
