I'm having the same problems here with linux 2.6.8-rc2 kernel here with
an Intel SAI2 dual SMP P3 motherboard with Serverworks Serverset III LE
chipset and CSB5 southbridge.
I run one WDC WD400BB-00DEA0 as master on each channel with SW RAID1 for
system. To even get DMA working I had to add
append="ide0=ata66 ide1=ata66"
in my lilo config. The system works fine with low load on the disks, but
if I copy greater amounts of data from a local SW RAID5 array I get the
same DMA timeout error and often it locks up completely.
If i disable DMA with hdparm the system works fine.
/proc/ide/svwks output:
(DMA disabled with hdparm)
                             ServerWorks OSB4/CSB5/CSB6
                            ServerWorks CSB5 Chipset (rev 93)
