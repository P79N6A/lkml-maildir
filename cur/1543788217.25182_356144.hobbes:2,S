The October release of LTP is now available:
LTP-20051005
- this patch touchs up the output of ver_linux if gcc, fdformat, or mount
is missing
- New testcases for tpm
- Fix compile error with strsep on some systems.
- Add a missing include file and corrects an fprintf
  format type to eliminate warning messages.  It also performs some minor
  whitespace cleanup.
- patch attached fixes it so writetest is rebuilt whenever writetest.c is
updated
- patch typecasts in writetest - the values given to printf to (long long
int)
- patch initializes some uninitialized variables and adds a
  return statement (non-void function) to eliminate warning messages.
- patch process.c adds a missing include file, function return types
  and returns, cleans up structure initializations, and removes unused
  variables to eliminate warning messages.  The debug print macro is also
  modified to handle a variable number of arguments.
- patch basically stubs out the GetContext function for uClibc and allows
for any
  other system to be added accordingly since uClibc doesn't provide the
function
  on later builds.
- Added code to check whether or not "ffffffff" is returned on some 64bit
  machines.
- Fix for defect 17215 in nanosleep02
- patch adds a missing include file, function return types
  and returns, and typecasts some variables to eliminate warning messages.
  GNU_SOURCE is also added to CFLAGS in the makefile, since otherwise
  the 'pselect' declaration is not found in some build environments.
- Fix for defect 17723 pTrace01.c
- patch adds missing include files and declares return types
  to eliminate warning messages for setfsuidxx.c
- TEST_ERRNO fix to display as a long int.
- Change sigrelse01 tests to eliminate duplicate function prototypes.
- Change to sigrelse01 to use time.h vs define in program.
- Fix for defect 17974, Strace/Ptrace hangs
- patch adds missing include files, function prototypes and
  returns, and removes unused variables to eliminate warning messages.
  It also corrects some sprintf format warnings and replaces 'abortx' with
  a version that accepts a variable number of arguments.
- The "generate.sh" script was mistakenly removed...added it back.
- Updates to check for connection failure vs unauthorized access fail in
ftp02_s1, ftp03, ftp04, ftp05
- Cleanup - Removed the datafile directory, because this is created using
the generate.sh
  script..which is called in the Makefile
