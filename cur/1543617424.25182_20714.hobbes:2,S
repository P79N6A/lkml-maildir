Well, I actually disagree on this.  For large include files (fs.h is the 
worst), and complicated arrangement, this technique eliminates spurious 
includes and saves a lot on compile time (really!).  If your concern is 
that the convention is not consistent, I'll gladly patch all of them to 
use the same format (ie use an __ prefix and escape / to __ and . to _).
