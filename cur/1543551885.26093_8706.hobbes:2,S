Subject: three kernel trees?

What about creating three kernel series:
2.2. stable
2.4. feature frozen
2.5 development?
As soon as 2.4 comes out,  2.7 is created, 2.6test
will be feature frozen.
Development time would be shorter, and
the nuisance with "this important feature has tz slip
in" would be finished.
