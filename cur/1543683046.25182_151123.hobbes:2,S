In another thread I wrote about my MWDMA mode disk problems. One thing
that I noticed there was a strange message during disabling DMA.
I access hdd, I get DMA timeouts for hdd (for whatever reasons), then
suddenly comes a message that DMA is disabled for hdc (not hdd).  hdc
was not accessed at all suring this time - it's a cdrom and no CD was
inserted and no CD access was tried.
Is this a bug?
