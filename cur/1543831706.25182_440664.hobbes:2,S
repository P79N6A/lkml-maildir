yes, exactly this. I don't know if it's correct and/or needed. In 2.6,
the d_delete() is performed outside the lock. I'd like someone's advise
on this one. Also, I'll look for an NFS client stress test to try to
reproduce the problem, because I don't like it when problems like this
only appear once a day. And playing with the VFS does not make me happy
at all.
