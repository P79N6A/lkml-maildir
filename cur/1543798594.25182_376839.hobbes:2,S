Yes, select is permitted to return before full timeout value, but on an 
idle, fast machine one hopes this does not happen too too often. And one 
also hopes that overruns are not too frequent. However, the results I 
get were, as can be seen from the select histogram, rather all over.

well, there are a large number of applications that we have that use 
select(). These include CORBA ORBs etc and we would like to run them and 
get the benefits of excellent RT properties of -rt kernel.  It would be 
too too difficult for us, at least for now, to rewrite an ORB in such a 
way that it does not use any select() but instead uses nanosleep().  I 
assume high resolution timers must be more expensive - that is why they 
do not get used by select(). But there are cases where I don't mind 
paying the extra overhead, if any, to obtain good behaviour out of 
select().

Sigh, but thanks for the comments.
