hi!
Congratulations for the 2.6 kernel, it seems more mature than 2.4 test
kernels!
 
My 2.6 experience (linux-2.6.0-test4) is basically *very* good, but
some remarks:
1) Documents/Changes should be updated to:
    module-init-tools      0.9.13                  # depmod -V
  Earlier module-init-tools do not work. at least nor for me.
.......

  Hi Armin.
  I don't know why the previous module-init-tools don't work
for your system. I am using the 2.6.0-test4 kernel (with the
Nick Piggin ideas about schedule patched) and i can manage
modules perfectly. This is my depmod -V output:
module-init-tools 0.9.10
  Maybe you can have another thing broken?.
  Regards.
  Jose.
