Thanks Gerd. I have put a comment to make things more clear. Please find
attahched the attached regenerated patch.
o There seems to be one extra ALIGN(4096) before symbol __smp_alt_end. The
  only usage of __smp_alt_end is to mark the end of smp alternative
  sections so that this memory can be freed. As a physical page is freed
  one has to just make sure that there is no other data on the same page
  where __smp_alt_end is pointing. There is already a ALIGN(4096) after
  this section which should take care of the above issue. Hence it looks
  like the ALIGN(4096) before __smp_alt_end is redundant and not required.
