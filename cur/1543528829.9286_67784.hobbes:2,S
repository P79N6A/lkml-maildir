Hi,
I'm using a Megaraid RAID controller with RAID 5 under Linux (2.2.14).
I think the Megamgr is a great tool for configuring RAID volumes, but I'm
looking specifically for:
- A "not menu driven" tool that can be used remotely through a slow
connection (something with the unconfortable user interface of fdisk will be
perfect :))
- Some tool/daemon/whatever that issues some alert (mail, page) whenever a
HD failure occurs and the hot spare disk starts working... Ideally this
tools would have to notify if the disk status changes in any way (HD
failure, rebuilding begins, rebuiding ends...).
- If none of the above is possible, any documentation of the IOCTL interface
of the MegaRAID controller in order to build some of the tools by myself
Any help will be appreciated... :)
...Xavier
P.D. Greetings from Barcelona
