As Alan Cox had noted,  you can escape with the help of an outside
process, but the classic chroot(TEMPDIR);chdir(..);...;chroot(.)
did not work against either the namespace-based or certainly not the
older (inode_permission-based) implementation.
But in the end vserver with read-only bind mounts seems a better way to
go imo.
