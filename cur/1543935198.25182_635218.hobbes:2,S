One possible problem could be that the cgroup can also have
pages reclaimed in global reclaim, not just in local cgroup
reclaims.
That is, these cgroup's pages can also disappear or get
rotated without the cgroup's recent_rotated_file and 
recent_rotated_anon being affected at all.
Still, having the cgroup do the same thing as the global
zones is probably the best approximation.
