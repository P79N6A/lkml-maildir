Funny, I just installed a 'full' Linux distro on a CF, like with a
regular harddisk, and it runs in full rw mode. Packing it up in a
squashfs and running the thing with aufs did not seem worth
the hassle of setting up a specialized initrd. And then, when you
need to make one change (firewall), it's faster than recreating the
sqfs image.
Will see how it long that lasts.
