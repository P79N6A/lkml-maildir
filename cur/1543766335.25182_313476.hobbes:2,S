There's no need to have the SHA1 object reference twice.  It will only be 
in the clear text, nowhere else.  Of course scripts that display the log,
could show the object reference in the header area for aesthetics. 
Another nice thing is that this works no matter cleartext signing methods
emerge in the future.
