Under 2.2.12, some processes seem to get permanently stuck in 'RW' or
'D'/'DW' state (according to ps). kill -9 doesn't work. system was
still running fine except for high system load and running process eating
100% cpu. 'WCHAN' seems to indicate kernel is getting stuck in
__down_failed
Under 2.0.3x this never happened.
Stock 2.2.12 kernel (no patches), stock redhat 5.2 install.
