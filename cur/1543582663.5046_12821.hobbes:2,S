This looks great, in fact I was working on something similar for
myself.  Unfortunately, like all good documentation, it's already
slightly out of date.  Just this morning I noticed that as of the
2.4.2-preX, the __make_request function no longer contains this code:
       if (!q->plugged)
               q->request_fn(q);
I don't know why the change was made, and I have not yet found where
how q->request_fn gets called for non-plugged request queues, but
since this is one of the key steps of the whole process, it will be
great to keep this documentation current.
