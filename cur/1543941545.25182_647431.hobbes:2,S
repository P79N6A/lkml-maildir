Unfortunately the /dev/rtc code became a legacy API for good reasons.
Like not recognizing that all the world's not a PC, with a single RTC
that clones a long-obsolete chip from Motorola ... and not having been
specified in a hardware-neutral manner.  Oh, and of course not all
systems actually used the same RTC driver anyway; it's not like there
was just *one* such programming interface to worry about.

What "anti-adoption" barriers would those be?  Pavel's immediate
problem was easy to solve, though he didn't know it.
From the perspective of almost anyone not using a PC, all the
adoption barriers were on the side of the /dev/rtc code.
