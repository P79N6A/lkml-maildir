This might be a stupid question, but why exactly are we ripping out
generic__raw_read_trylock() if architectures are going to implement a
generic implementation anyways, rather than just changing it to match
the proper semantics?
With this the m32r patch can be dropped and the rest of the
architectures can switch over as necessary to optimized versions, rather
than being fundamentally broken.
