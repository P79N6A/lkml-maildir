Would it be possible for ndiswrapper to provide a seperate stack
to the windows code so this problem is seperable?
How debuggable is stack overrun? I mean if I am the unlucky
admin who decides to setup a crypto/raid/stripe/thing setup
which runs out of stack somewhere how easy will it be
for someone who doesn't know the innards to know what
happened as opposed to running into a random oops?
