Hello there,
I want to use the fault injection capability infrastructure to  
implement a simple fault injector which I can use in one of my  
modules. But when trying to call init_fault_attr_dentries (*), I got  
an undefined warning and noticed that this symbol is not exported even  
when CONFIG_FAULT_INJECTION and CONFIG_FAULT_INJECTION_DEBUG_FS are  
defined.
Then, I checked the implementation of the framework in lib/fault- 
injection.c and noticed that, really, it doesn't export any symbol.
Is the infrastructure unavailable to be used by kernel modules?
(*) I noticed some inconsistencies in the documentation, like calling  
the init function as init_fault_attr_entries instead of  
init_fault_attr_dentries. I can submit an updated documentation after  
I can make it work.
Please CC me any reply,
Thanks in advance,
