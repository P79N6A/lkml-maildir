Actually...
At front-door the bogofilter analyzes message for spam-signature
and does classification.  It reports the class to SMTP receiver's
content policy controller, that usually chooses to believe it.
A number of recipient addresses are considered "filter free" and
they do always get messages no matter what BF or other content filters
consider the email.
The SMTP receiver also recognizes diffs in texts (but only when
unquoted) and exempts them of BF rulings (which sometimes do bite
on diffs.)
Honeypots train BF for SPAM.
Majordomo has tons of 'TABOO' filters and any match at them
trains BF also for SPAM.
Any message that was successfully accepted to any list is
trained as HAM.
I am considering teaching the system to recognize VGER's lists
specially, and to verify that sender is in the list, or at possible
extra 'posters' list.  (Did I create one, or did I plan only ?)
Anyway, if MAIL FROM address is at either, then message is again
exempted of Bogofilter.
Presently majordomo and front-end SMTP are not in any direct contact,
and that kind of policy decissions are not made at SMTP input time.
They are done silently a bit latter.
I can move most of the Majordomo policy rules to front-end policy
controller -- it is perl, after all  :-)
