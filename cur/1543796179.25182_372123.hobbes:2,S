The input core changed the way it exports its information in sysfs.  Now
it properly shows the heirachy of input devices (look at the difference
in /sys/class/input in 2.6.14 and 2.6.15-rc2.)  A recent version of udev
is required to be updated to handle this properly, but if you are on
unstable, you should already have that change.
Hope this helps explain things.
