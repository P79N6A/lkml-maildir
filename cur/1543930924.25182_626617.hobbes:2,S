Thanks for the note. Zip drive as only device on the bus did not work
for me. kernel is correctly identifying the Jmicron chip.
Removed the DVD drive and jumpered the Zip drive to Master. BIOS
set to IDE. Fedora 8 with nash on boot:
Buffer I/O error on dev/sdc locaical block 0
dmesg:
Buffer I/O error on device sdc, logical block 0
sd 4:0:0:0: [sdc] Result: hostbyte=DID_OK driverbyte=DRIVER_SENSE,SUGGEST_OK
sd 4:0:0:0: [sdc] Sense Key : Hardware Error [current]
sd 4:0:0:0: [sdc] Add. Sense: Scsi parity error
end_request: I/O error, dev sdc, sector 0
Buffer I/O error on device sdc, logical block 0

sd 4:0:0:0: [sdc] Sense Key : Hardware Error [current]
sd 4:0:0:0: [sdc] Add. Sense: Scsi parity error
end_request: I/O error, dev sdc, sector 0
Buffer I/O error on device sdc, logical block 0
Dev sdc: unable to read RDB block 0
udev creates a /dev/sdc only.
With DVD removed and BIOS set to AHCI device changes to sda
Fedora 8: nash:
Buffer I/O error on device sda, logical block 0
dmesg:
Buffer I/O error on device sda, logical block 0
sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] Result: hostbyte=DID_OK driverbyte=DRIVER_SENSE,SUGGEST_OK
