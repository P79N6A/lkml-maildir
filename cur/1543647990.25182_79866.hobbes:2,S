As I said before, edicts help no one. I appreciate your sentiment, and
to some degree share it, but you have to take a non-cheerleader look at
things like this.

No one is saying that. No one is even saying that mainline inclusion
isn't extremely beneficial to EVMS or DM. The question isn't whether DM
or EVMS would be impacted more positively if it were included. The
question is whether mainline would be better off including them, and not
the other way around.
Also, let me define the phrase "better off" to mean "better off W.R.T.
design, architecture, overall code quality, abstractions in the right
place, etc etc", and not to mean politically, as in, more users.
Honestly though, if you aren't able to do the work it takes to be a 3rd
party patch tester, it's less likely you can properly test or submit
proper bug reports in the first place.
