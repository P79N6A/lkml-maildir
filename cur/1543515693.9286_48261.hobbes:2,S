OK - reasonable enough.
It is easy to add some ioctl that does what you want.
On the other hand, there are not so many people that want to go
from a disk with to a disk without Disk Manager without rebooting.
[And even if the ioctl is there, who will use it?
 Hmm. Of course the new blockdev utility.
 I suppose I'll add it sooner or later.]
