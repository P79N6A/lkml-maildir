Howdy folks. It seems that in the 2.2.2pre1 patch the AFFS (amiga file
system) support got broken. 2.2.1 is fine, 2.2.2pre1, pre2 and pre5
are not.
Here are the error msgs I get on a mount attempt:
1000.root@kinder:/root>> mount /mars/azip
 hdc:<5>ll_rw_block: device 16:00: only 512-char blocks implemented (1024)
Dev 16:00: unable to read RDB block 0
 unknown partition table
AFFS: Could not determine device size
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/hdc1,
       or too many mounted file systems
 hdc:<5>ll_rw_block: device 16:00: only 512-char blocks implemented (1024)
Dev 16:00: unable to read RDB block 0
 unknown partition table
       (aren't you trying to mount an extended partition,
       instead of some logical partition inside?)
And on bootup, witht he zip disk in:
