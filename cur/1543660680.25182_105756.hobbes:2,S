Hello...
I had posted question yesterday. That post can be seen at
    
http://www.lkml.org/archive/2003/1/25/4/index.html
After doing some more testing with standalone UDP program, 
the transfer rates are normal and as expected on 2.4.20.
The same performance can be seen on 2.4.19.
There is a similar posting at:

So, the problem may be with NFS. NFS is not an issue for me 
and I can do with this problem. Hope this helps whoever is
testing or working on related areas.
Best regards,
