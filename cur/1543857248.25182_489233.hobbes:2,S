?
Can you please quote chapter and verse (in POSIX) where it states that
ENOTSUP and EOPNOTSUP have to be numerically distinct?  If you are
reading Unix 98 you might be able to make a claim that there is an
implication that they be assigned unique error numbers, but it's at
best an implication, not an explicitly specified requirement in any of
the standards documents that I'm aware of.
To folks who are participating in the committee doing work on the
upcoming POSIX revisions (which might make this a requirement to be
imposed on us in a year or two) --- will that likely impose such a
requirement?  In that case we might want to start thinking about
separating the two, but it really is a question of is the benefits are
worth the effort.
