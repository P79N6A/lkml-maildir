Don't think that was me.  I stayed out of those early discussions
because I wasn't comfortable guessing at the proper semantics yet.
But really, I, as admin, have to set up both propagation and user mounts
for a particular subtree, so why would I *not* want user mounts to be
propagated?
So, in my own situation, I have done
	make / rshared
	mount --bind /share /share
	make /share unbindable
	for u in $users; do
		mount --rbind / /share/$u/root
		make /share/$u/root rslave
		make /share/$u/root rshared
		mount --bind -o user=$u /share/$u/root/home/$u /share/$u/root/home/$u
	done
All users get chrooted into /share/$USER/root, some also get their own
namespace.  Clearly if a user in a new namespace does
	mount --bind -o user=me ~/somedir ~/otherdir
then logs out, and logs back in, I want the ~/otherdir in the new
namespace (and the one in the 'init' namespace) to also be owned by
'me'.
> That sounds good if everyone agrees?
I've shown where I think propagating the mount owner is useful.  Can you
detail a scenario where doing so would be bad?  Then we can work toward
semantics that make sense...
