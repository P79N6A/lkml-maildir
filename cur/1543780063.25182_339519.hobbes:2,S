Ok.

Ok, that sounds reasonable. I have not yet searched for the partition
parsing code for dm but it should not be too hard to write this on
one's own. However, it is not clear to me whether this would work
automatically, i.e. insert dvd-ram medium -> udev event is triggered ->
device nodes are created via dmsetup.
Will there some (udev) event be triggered once a dvd-ram medium is
inserted?
Moreover, some event would have to be triggered if the dvd-ram medium
is removed in order to delete the device nodes.

Thomas
