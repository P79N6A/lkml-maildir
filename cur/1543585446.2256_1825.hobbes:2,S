I just glanced at Alan's change list, it didn't have patches
that seemed to cover that (vs ac20).
You might see what sort of luck you have with the patches
I posted to linux-usb-devel earlier today.  At least both
usb-ohci and usb-uhci enumerated even after configuring
in slab debugging ... but there are bugs yet to be found.
Maybe it deserves a CONFIG_DEBUG_PCI_POOL to
decouple autopoisoning from CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB.

It's been sent to Linus.  Unless/until someone learns the
vendor fix and implements it, it seems to be the best way
to prevent the 756-specific USB problems (happening
most with lowspeed devices like mice).
