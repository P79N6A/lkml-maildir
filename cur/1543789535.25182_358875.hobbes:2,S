Sure. The problem is that mappings are shared between VCs but anyway
it's solved by disabling user changes.
I don't think there is a solution here, easier than hardware reset.
As for "server" machines (not simple terminals), physical locking is
critical.

In security-sensitive instalation, you simply don't expose the computers
to non-admins.

Hope they don't change the keys in the process.
Anyway, most people don't need that nor they need suid-wrapper.
BTW: there are similar problems with serial access: users can play
with termio(s) settings (especially CLOCAL flag) and fake
login/password requests. Unless the getty programs are fixed,
you don't want to connect dial-in modems to a machine with user
accounts. Not a kernel thing, though - Linux has termios locking
for 10+ yrs.
