This is a patch to clean things up so compiling with -Wundef becomes
feasible (This patch cuts the number of warnings with 'make allyesconfig'
drop from around 10,000 to several hundred).  It was originally inspired
by the discussion of things that include linux/version.h but don't use
the contents - after doing this, I was able to find that there *WAS* at
least one place where version.h was missing (see following patch).
