Hi,
I'm migrating my server from windows 2003 server to Ubuntu, but I am
stumbling over the "Low Power State Link Speed" option for my NIC
(forcedeth)
I need to disable this option in my windows driver otherwise the trough pout is
horrible because the link fluctuates constantly from 100/1000.
Anyway, my question is where and how can I turn off this feature for the
forcedeth driver? I've looked in the source and as far as I can tell there is no
bootoption for this. There are some references noted in the code, but AFAIK
no setting.
Any ideas? Thanks in advance!
