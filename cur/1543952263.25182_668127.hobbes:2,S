I don't think so. I remember we had much more problems with noname
disks. And yes, certain brands had been problematic too, but most
(such as Fuji and 3M, and others) were fine.

The real life can't agree with this at all. The servers keep working
for years and the cheap stuff quit fast (if initially working, which
is not always the case).

Most BIOS (all I've seen in this Millennium) have an option to disable
that.
On a server board you can usually have a remote console, how could
that work otherwise?

We already have RAM between L3 and Flash.
The problem is flushing L1 to disk/flash takes time.
