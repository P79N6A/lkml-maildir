OK, I will try to take a look at this.
The correct fix though is to upgrade module-utils to no rely on depmod.
Rusty mentioned this long time ago but no-one did it so far.

OK, but I have yet to find a clean solution for it.

The objective is to provide full support for external modules in 2.6.
And you raised two valid points.
