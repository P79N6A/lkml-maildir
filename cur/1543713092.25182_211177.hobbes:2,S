Yeah, you may be right about that.
On UP it should compile as such:
cpu_online_map => cpumask_of_cpu(0) => 
mask_of_bit(0, _unused_cpumask_arg_) => 
({ typeof(_unused_cpumask_arg_) m; mask_clearall(m); mask_setbit(0, m);
m; }) => 
({ cpumask_t m; m._m[0] = 0UL; set_bit(0, m._m); m; }) 
Maybe we could #define it better on UP.  Something along the lines of:
#define cpu_online_map	({ cpumask_t up_cpu_map = { 1UL }; })
That way we'll get this inlined, plus very little code to execute?
Cheers!
