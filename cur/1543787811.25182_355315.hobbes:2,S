the minimum alignment as specified in the x64 ABI is 1 Megabyte (this
was discussed last week already here after the first time you asked it,
and also is not a kernel thing so your questions are off-topic for this
mailing list). ld.so decides the easiest way to get that alignment is to
PROT_NONE it, also to make sure nothing can go "in the middle" of such a
library.
