Yes, thank you, Ctrl+Alt+F$n now works if only I
CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK_SLEEP=n.
Also `sudo cat /proc/kmsg | tee ...` also suddenly starts working.
I wonder if somehow /proc/kmsg now working is a clue?  Back with =y, my
`dmesg` was clean but via /proc/kmsg I was seeing garbage like
mmae t itbl
or:
mmae t itle
for what now again is such reassuring chatter as:

P.S. I could easily check to see if =y kills an ssh session or just the
display, if that helps.
P.P.S.
Tentatively I conclude "sleep debugging ... off" meant this .config
change because I see:
$ make defconfig
...
$ grep -i sleep .config
CONFIG_ACPI_SLEEP=y
CONFIG_ACPI_SLEEP_PROC_FS=y
CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK_SLEEP=y
$ vi +/DEBUG_SPINLOCK_SLEEP .config
...
Kernel hacking ...
Sleep-inside-spinlock checking (DEBUG_SPINLOCK_SLEEP)
If you say Y here, various routines which may sleep will become very
noisy if they are called with a spinlock held.
...
Google isn't quickly confirming/ denying this tentative conclusion of
mine.
