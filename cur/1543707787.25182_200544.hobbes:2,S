Dear Customer,
I apologize for any difficulty you have had in getting the GPL/LGPL
governed code you are looking for.  
We would be happy to send you a CD-ROM with all of the code governed by
the GPL and/or LGPL included in our IntruShield products.  CD is our
preferred medium for distributing the code.  I believe that Bradley Kuhn
has stated that the FSF does not consider online distribution "a medium
customarily used for software interchange."  
I will look forward to your reply.
Regards,
Jocelyn Brown
Product Compliance / Legal Affairs
