However, my argument is straight logic, nothing "circular" about it.  :)
Replacing "X" in my logic path above with "tivoization" and "license" 
with "GPLv3", as you've done, does produce a valid chain of logic.

FWIW the Linux Kernel shouldn't be as homogeneous a population as it is. I'd 
expect it with an FSF run project, because they require copyright assignment 
in order to participate, but with a project like Linux, where everyone 
maintains the copyright to their contributions, should be a hell of a lot 
less homogeneous than Linus' numbers make it seem.

Actually, any generic "TiVO"-like hardware - whether it is tivoized or not. 
Admittedly the numbers are significantly different for PC's (and other types 
of general purpose computing devices).

38ppm is a fairly small amount, regardless.

You've been making the argument the entire time you've been arguing that 
the "anti-tivoization" language in the GPLv3 is necessary. I think I'd rather 
see a guaranteed increase of developers - even if it is only 10 - rather than 
hoping that the potential pool of 38 actually follows through. Wouldn't you?
