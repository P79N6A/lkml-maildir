Yeah, you should send those messages to me, rather than Larry, 'cuz I
don't get pissed when people say "thanks for bending over, now bend over
farther".

This is most profitably done outside of bkbits -- the kernel.org URLs
you point to should work (there's no reason they can't be made to go)
and it's hard to see the payoff to bkbits to providing it internally.
Gotta remember, bkbits is more than just kernel stuff.  We're probably
not going to add code that is only useful to the kernel project.
The stuff larry added this weekend, by comparison, is stuff that makes
our lives better and has a payoff for us and our customers, while
simultaneously making life better for bkbits users.  Win-win.  (Or is
that win-win-win?)

Yeah, go bug somebody else. :)
No, seriously, thanks for the feedback, and I'm glad the patch server
looks to be useful.  I just hope it doesn't suck too much bandwidth.
