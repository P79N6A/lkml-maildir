The common way to deal with this is first to restructure your function 
into two.  One always acquires the lock, and the other (often written 
with a "__" prefix) never acquires it.  The never-acquire code does the 
actual work, and the always-acquire function calls it.
You then refactor the callers so that you don't have any code paths on 
which you can't predict whether or not the lock will be held.
