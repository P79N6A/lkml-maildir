MT_TOUCH_MAJOR is the major size of the touching object, or "pressure" in
case the size of the approaching object (MT_WIDTH_MAJOR) is not available
to compare the size to. The touch and position packets are sent to the
multitouch X driver, where the actual finger tracking takes place. Thanks
for the chance to clarify this.

Very interesting idea, although I believe it is beyond the scope of the
current patch.
