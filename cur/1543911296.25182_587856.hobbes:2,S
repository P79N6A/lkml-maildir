Sorry, Linus, I don't agree. The whole point of 'volatile' is to say to the
compiler, "DO NOT OPTIMIZE THIS. What you think is harmless may break things
you do not and should not understand." The combination of the read and the
compare into a single operation is a compiler optimization.
While it would not be unreasonable to still allow this optimization (since I
cannot think of any situations in which it could be harmful), it is just as
reasonable not to.
