IMHO, this is the uglier of the two fixes for the problem, as this means
you'll still be clobbering lib/zlib_inflate/*.o when ZLIB_INFLATE!=n.
The other is to go back to putting the object in $(O)/arch/ppc/boot/lib/
and copying the guts of the .c.o rule to arch/ppc/boot/lib/Makefile
Sam, any chance you've had time to think up a good fix to this?  Thanks.
