As long it is documented and it _works_ that's no problem. But it was
quite a hassle to get working cross-compilers for all 23 archs
to build, because for some there is no real documentation which
target is the correct one and upstream gcc and/or binutils sometimes
don't compile.
For example where can I find information about the arm26 arch?
I suppose it can be build with a normal arm toolchain (and the
breakage looks like a real compiler failure), but is this documented
somewhere?
It would be nice to have such documentation in kernel under
Documentation/$arch/HOW-TO-BUILD for every arch.
How much work is it to set-up an openembedded environment anyways?
