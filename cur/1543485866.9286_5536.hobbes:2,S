Things change, and often for good reason. But the thing Monty was
complaining about (a change in the CDROM ioctl interface, IIRC) did in
fact appear to be the result of carelessness. Breaking an interface
should require _a really good reason_ and alternative should be
investigated. In this case, a new ioctl would have done the trick just
fine.
