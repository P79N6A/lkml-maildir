I can think of a potential solution for this issue:
Create something new which is like symlinks, but which has its own
permissions.  Since these permissions would allow things that would
otherwise be impossible (otherwise, what's the point?), a few restrictions
would be necessary.  For example:
	[a] if permissions are satisfied, you get to act as the owner
	of the link for the purpose of file access, nothing more.
	[b] to reduce the scope of this card, the directory which holds
	the target file must have a special bit which says that its files
	may be accessed this way, and every parent directory must have
	a different bit which says that this is possible.
This might also be used as part of a scheme to seal up the static
parts of proc.
