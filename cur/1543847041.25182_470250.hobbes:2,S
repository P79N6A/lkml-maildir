Well I did google for this before this report and eg.
http://nchip.livejournal.com/
 already mentioned it (but probably
didn't report it at lkml) and there where some other links.
But since I couldn't find any info on this new feature, that one can
now read and write file through the /proc/xx/root link, I ask it here.
And hopefully, if it's a regression, would be fixed in the stable tree
ASAP. (Somehow I almost can't believe this change wouldn't show
immediately in a regression test setup, and there must be a reason for
opening this door w/o using an axe).
