I am getting ready to write a new watchdog timer for a couple of
different cpci single board computers, and was wondering if there are
plans to move to a sysfs based api.  The current model (as documented in
Documentation/watchdog-api.txt) is based on the old way of doing things,
with ioctls for configuring and reading/writing to a char device for
refreshing the watchdog.
