Yes, that's it.  Thank you, and sorry about that.  (I'll go configure
for checkout-get mode now...)
Now I see:
drivers/char/tpqic02.c: In function `__initfn':
drivers/char/tpqic02.c:2798: parse error before "void"
make[2]: *** [drivers/char/tpqic02.o] Error 1
I'm guessing that may be fixed in 2.5.47-ac2[&4]?
