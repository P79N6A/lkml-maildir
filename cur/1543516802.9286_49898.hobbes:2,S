Hi Alan,
I was wondering if you would consider this for 2.2.14 (or 15).
It does the following:
	- updates the contect details for Paul Mackerras and
	  Andrew Tridgell (co-workers of mine).
APM changes:
	-  Merge 2.2 and 2.3 drivers. (as much as possible)
	-  Remove APM dependencies in arch/i386/kernel/process.c
	-  Remove APM dependencies in drivers/char/sysrq.c
	-  Reset time across standby.
	-  Allow more inititialisation on SMP.
	-  Remove CONFIG_APM_POWER_OFF and make it boot time
	   configurable (default on).
	-  Make debug only a boot time parameter (remove APM_DEBUG).
	-  Try to blank all devices on any error.
	-  Remove APM dependencies in drivers/char/console.c
	-  Fix for bioses that don't zero the top part of the
	   entrypoint offset (Mario Sitta <sitta@al.unipmn.it>)
	   (reported by Panos Katsaloulis <teras@writeme.com>).
I have built and run (and tested mostly) this same patch (but using
2.2.14pre7) and everything seems at least as OK as my desktop
requires.  (My laptop is still in Rusty's hands ...)
If this is too much, please let me know and I will try to extract
bits out of it for you.  I still intend to try to fix a couple
of outstanding bugs, but maybe 2.2 will stabilize too much and
so I will only have to fix 2.3 :-)
Patch is at

Cheers,
Stephen
