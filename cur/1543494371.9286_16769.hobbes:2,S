I would suspect that networking the two machines together and just
doing a `telnet` through to the one without a display or keyboard
would be the cheaper option. I know that my network consists of a
total of 9 machines, with only one monitor and two keyboards between
them - and the second keyboard is plugged into one that won't boot
without a keyboard, but is otherwise unused...
