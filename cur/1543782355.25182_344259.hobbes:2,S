Yes. The compiler must make sure that every effect of all previous
code and all side-effects are complete at a "sequence-point". There
are several sequence-points and the most obvious is a ";".
The compiler is free to reorder anything in a compound statement
as long as it complies with presidence rules, but it can't re-order
the statements themselves.
In other words:
volatile unsigned int *hardware = virtual(MY_DEVICE);
    *hardware = 1;
    *hardware = 2;
    *hardware = 4;
    *hardware = 8;
.. happens exactly as shown above. If it didn't, you couldn't
write device drivers. An example of the code above:
 	.file	"xxx.c"
 	.text
.globl foo
 	.type	foo, @function
foo:
 	pushl	%ebp
 	movl	%esp, %ebp
 	subl	$4, %esp
 	movl	$305419896, -4(%ebp)	// init the pointer
 	movl	-4(%ebp), %eax		// Get pointer
 	movl	$1, (%eax)		// *hardware = 1;
 	movl	-4(%ebp), %eax		// Get pointer
 	movl	$2, (%eax)		// *hardware = 2;
 	movl	-4(%ebp), %eax		// Get pointer
 	movl	$4, (%eax)		// *hardware = 4;
 	movl	-4(%ebp), %eax		// Get pointer
 	movl	$8, (%eax)		// *hardware = 8;
 	movl	$0, %eax
 	leave
 	ret
 	.size	foo, .-foo
 	.section	.note.GNU-stack,"",@progbits
 	.ident	"GCC: (GNU) 3.3.3 20040412 (Red Hat Linux 3.3.3-7)"
Because of the necessary 'volatile' keyword, even the pointer is
obtained over again each time. This wastes CPU cycles. One
could do:
 	movl	$1, (%eax)
 	movl	$2, (%eax)
 	movl	$4, (%eax)
 	movl	$8, (%eax)
.. after the pointer is loaded. Unfortunately, 'C' doesn't have
a keyword that would accommodate that.
When communicating across a PCI/Bus, the writes are cached.
They don't necessarily occur __now__. It will take a (perhaps
dummy) read of the PCI/Bus to make them get to the hardware
now. Even then, they will still get there in order, all 4 writes,
because the interface is a FIFO. A read on the PCI/Bus will force
all pending writes to be written).
Some arcitectures do write-combining which means that, for instance
on an Intel Pentium P6, it's possible for all writes of adjacent
words may be condensed into a single quadword write. This may not be
what you want. If you have such a situation, one would execute
WBINVD after the critical writes. No not do this just to "make sure".
It wastes a lot of bandwidth.

In-line doesn't care. It's not as complicated as many expect.
