Maybe a offtopic question.
An ATM switch with an ATM port and serval Ethernet ports. Each port
link a computer. If a computer on Ethernet port want to communicate with
computer on ATM port, it would first send an ARP request, then, what
is the dest MAC it receive?
( I'm trying to make my Linux box an ATM bridge between two ATM switchs
)
