Hi !
I have a program that uses the SO_PASSCRED socket option on a connected UNIX
socket.
This program works fine under 2.2, but under 2.4 I receive an EOPNOTSUPP when
doing the recvmsg() call on the new socket after a client connects.
Is this a known feature, or should I go look for the problem  ?
I did peek into the net/unix and net/core code and compared 2.2.14 and 2.4,
but this is out of my league.  Sorry.
I'm running 2.4.0-test2 on i686 SMP.
Thanks,
