Hi,
Here the early oops I'm stuck with in 2.5.65. Had to write it down manually, 
so the report is not complete. If I missed something crucial, please ask. The 
bug is easy to reproduce, so I can write anything down you need.
exact oops message scrolled away, console isn't set up yet, so I can't scroll 
back.
EIP at current_kernel_time +0x0f/0x40
called from:
sysfs_new_inode

My config is attached.
