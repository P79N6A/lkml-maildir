I don't think this is 100% correct. After del_timer_sync() returns another
thread can come and call do_setitimer() and re-arm the timer (because with
your patch we are dropping tsk->sighand->siglock here). So this patch does
not garantees that the timer is not queued/running after del_timer_sync(),
and the it_real_arm can be called on two CPUS simultaneously again.
There is a try_to_del_timer_sync() in the -mm tree which is suitable here:
	again:
		spin_lock_irq(&tsk->sighand->siglock);
		if (try_to_del_timer_sync(&tsk->signal->real_timer) < 0) {
			spin_unlock_irq(&tsk->sighand->siglock);
			goto again;
		}
Oleg.
