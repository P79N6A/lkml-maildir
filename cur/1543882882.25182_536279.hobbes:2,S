ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.21-rc7/2.6.21-rc7-mm2/broken-out/
contains
lutimesat-simplify-utime2.patch
lutimesat-extend-do_utimes-with-flags.patch
lutimesat-actual-syscall-and-wire-up-on-i386.patch
lutimesat-compat-syscall-and-wire-up-on-x86_64.patch
in that patching order.
I'll drop those four and will grab utimensat v3.
