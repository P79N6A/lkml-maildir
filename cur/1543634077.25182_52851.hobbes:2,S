Ehh. Since you _cannot_ do __fput() from an interrupt context, something
is broken.
Possibly the comments.
If aio calls down to __fput() from an interrupt context, then aio is
clearly broken. Yet that's what the comments seem to imply.
The other alternative is that aio only does the book-keeping from
interrupt context, adds the "struct file * to be freed" to some list of
freeable files, and then does __fput() from _non_interrupt_ context on
those files.
Is that was aio actually _does_?
If so, the code may be fine, but the comments are misleading crap and
should be fixed asap.
