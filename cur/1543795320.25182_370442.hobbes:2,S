You could have done that without even rebooting, much less building a
new kernel, just download the latest ALSA from
http://www.alsa-project.org
 and follow the install instructions.  ALSA
detects your kernel sources and patches itself to build against that
kernel.  It will even work with a 2.2 kernel.
