Between alsa-driver 0.9.4 and alsa-driver 0.9.5 the change below was made.
Since then, suspending with a program outputting to the pcm device
causes that program to enter the uninterruptible sleep state. Reverting
this patch fixes the problem. The problem exists in 0.9.5 through 1.0.2c.
This problem affects kernel 2.6.3; applying the reversion of this patch
fixes it.

Just because it isn't nice doesn't make it any less a miracle.
