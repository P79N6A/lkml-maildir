well, i think this measurement issue needs resolving before jumping to
any generic conclusions. Not a single trace is extremely suspect. The
userspace timestamps are rdtsc based, or gettimeofday() based? In
theory, as long as no trace is triggered, there should not be any huge
overhead from tracing itself (when a trace is reported and saved then,
if the trace is large, it can be quite expensive that the tracer wont
report as a latency - but this isnt the case here).
