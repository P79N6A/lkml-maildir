This isn't going to rock either. If process A links
$PID->namespace:/const/exedir/ to /mnt/net/host_a/foo/bin and passes
/const/exedir/../lib/foo to process B, this process B must not
link it's $PID->namespace:/const/exedir/ to e.g. /opt/B/bin, but
exactly this is going to happen if you use a constant string.

Same problem.
IMO the program must be aware of the get-my-exedir feature, just configuring
--prefix=/proc/... is aiming for your feet.
/proc/pid/exedir may be a way to access the program files after changing the
namespace, but it may also be a security risk leaving the original namespace
accessible. Therefore I suggest abandoning the exedir idea and instead
1) change the programs to be aware of it's exedir:
   (my $exedir=`cat /proc/self/exe`) =~ s,/[^/]+$,,);
   if ($libdir !~ m,^/,) { $libdir = $exedir.'/'.$libdir };
 - or -
   ln -s /mnt/net/host_a/foo /usr/local/foo
   (cd /usr/local/bin && for a in ../foo/bin; do ln -s "$a";done)
2) If you want access across namespaces, use fopen etc. on an open
   directory handle
