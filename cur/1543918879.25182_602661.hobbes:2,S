MSI-X already has its own separate interrupt handlers.  MSI and INTx 
call the same interrupt handling code, like the unmodified driver goes. 
  Creating an MSI-specific irq handler would not save very much AFAICS, 
but I might be missing something.
Do you have ideas/suggestions for a different method?
