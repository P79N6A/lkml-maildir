A well-written GUI should not be using SCHED_YIELD.  If it is
"allocating", anything, it won't be using SCHED_YIELD or be marked
runnable, it will be blocked, waiting until the resource becomes
available.  When that happens, it will preempt the compute task (if its
priority is high enough, which is very likely - and can be assured if
it's running at a real-time priority as I suggested earlier).
