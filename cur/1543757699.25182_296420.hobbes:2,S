Your assumption is rather specific to a given platform... what if you
have a card with no ROM (embedded system) but your kernel has a copy of
what should be the ROM at hand ? (flash is expensive, heh :)

That isn't the case on all platforms. Also, I like the flexibility of
having a userland helper since that doesn't "tie" us to the semantics of
an x86 platform & BIOS (we could have an OF emulator too, or whatever
binary program provided by the vendor in userspace to reinit the card
without having to link that with the kernel).
I think my approach is the most flexible in the long run.

I don't think we have to do these assumptions. It should really be under
driver control.

Agreed.
