Please look at the code before you get to such conclusions...
The allocation bitmap is very much organized like a normal file, so HFS+ 
treats it like a file (e.g. its data is in the page cache), this file is 
just not visible outside HFS+, so I used the inode lock to synchronize the 
access to it. The lock ordering should be fine, lockdep just doesn't know 
about it.
