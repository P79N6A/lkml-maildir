I thought the idea with the ramdisk was that it is simply buffers that
don't belong to a physical device. When creating, say, a 512 kbyte
filesystem on /dev/ram0 the amount of buffers go up by about 512 kbyte so
that's ok. And if I write a file to the mounted ramdisk the amount of
buffers dont go up. But for example mkdir/rmdir causes yet more buffers to
be allocated. I found that weird. Before I go digging deep, I just wanted
to confirm that no more buffers should be allocated by the kernel for
operations on the ramdisk blocks ? Filesystem was ext2, kernel 2.0.33.
