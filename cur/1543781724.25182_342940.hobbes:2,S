The Linux kernel is technically one big process with lots of threads.
An environment variable is per process and is usally to be threated
read only within it.
Also the Linux kernel is the first "process" ever. 
Who should set up it's environment variables?
That's why there are none.
These arguments are no real proof in a mathematical sense,
but should help you argumenting.
