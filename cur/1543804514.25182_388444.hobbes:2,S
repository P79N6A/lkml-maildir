For my daily work I use the -git kernels on my production machines. And I didn't
have probs for a long time due to stuff being tested in -mm. -mm is mostly
broken for me (psmouse, now reiserfs, ...) but I tend to say that 2.6 is
rock-stable.
When it comes to API stability people are encouraged to stay up-to-date when
when developing stuff out of the kernel tree, ain't they? A more convenient way
would be to create a new in-kernel-tree wrapper module that wraps some functions
no longer available anymore and which are possible to be wrapped in the meaning
of all needed data is provided to the 'old' method and can be easyily wrapped
into the new function.
It could a Kconfig option so that the 'wrapper module' is only activated on
demand. Thus, having the option to port driver directly to the new API or just
silenty use the 'wrapper module' to translate the call while being noisy at
compile time.
You're free to write the module... ;)
