    This must be a K7/500 specific problem.  I'm currently using
    a K7/550 with 384mb core (1 dimms; 1x128, 1x256) as my primary
    workstation, and it's been very content since I set it up.
    I'm running Mastodon, and thus the 2.0.28 kernel, but it does
    have one of my e820 memory patches so it's using every bit of
    core -- when I fire up 2.3.x for e820 testing, it doesn't
    complain, but I don't run 2.3.x for very long because the
    network interfaces changed and thus dhcpcd doesn't work :-(
                  ____
    david parsons \bi/ both dimms are ECC, for what that's worth.
