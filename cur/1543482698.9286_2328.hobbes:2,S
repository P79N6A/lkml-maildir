I notcied in the release about 2.2.0 that some APM features have been
enabled on SMP machines becuase they are safe to use (soft power off and
the like I guess).  What I don't see is how to enable this.  I have an SMP
PII system and it still gives me an APM disabled message even when I only
have soft power enabled.
