The setup is 2-4 drives in raid0, with chunk size 1MB.
If I try to do ~50 simultanous reads from disk, it's no problem as long as 
the data is being read from the nic with the same speed as it's being read 
from disk. The server apps are running via inetd (testing), and have 2MB of 
buffer each. (read 2MB from disk, write 2MB to NIC).
The server chrashes within minutes. The same problem occurs when using Tux
thanks
