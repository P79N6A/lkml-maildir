Oh you are right. Now I searched it in FreeBSD kernel. They goes like this:
rss = pgtok(vmspace_resident_count(vm));
if (ru->ru_maxrss < rss)
	ru->ru_maxrss = rss;
Seems pretty reasonable to stick with the same behavior. Then I really
do not understand why /usr/bin/time does the conversion.
FreeBSD /usr/bin/time is very different and much simpler and (of
course) does not do this conversion.
So I suggest to change the patch to fill KB instead of pages and
change /usr/bin/time to not do the conversion. What do you think?
