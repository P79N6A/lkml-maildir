   I support source level in the kernel.  Based on Andi Klein's review, I
   have grabbed ext2utils and am looking at a minimal int 0x13 interface to
   load files into memory.  hardest problem here for Linux is having a tiny
   FS that won't deadlock to load source files.
You may also want to take a look at libext2fs which is part of
e2fsprogs.  It has a I/O abstraction which isolates the raw disk I/O
from the rest of the library.  (There's a unix_io.c and an nt_io.c; in
fact, there's even a dos_io.c which uses the int 0x13 interface,
although it'll probably require some reworking of the code to translate
it away from TurboC.)
In libext2fs, look at the fileio.c module; once you open the ext2
filesystem, you open, read, seek, etc. individual ext2 files in the ext2
filesystem.  I'm not sure the file write code works if it needs to
extend the file; and it's been the least tested of all of the functions,
but you wouldn't need this for a kernel debugger anyway.
