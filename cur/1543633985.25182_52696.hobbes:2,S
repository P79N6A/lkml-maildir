This may work for your disks. You just can't open the device node for a
tape, if there is no medium inserted. If you know the mapping between
to a sg device you can use it.
That's the second piece of information that /proc/scsi/map provides.
The first piece is that the kernel tells kernel tells you the way it is
attached by reporting CBTU, which is a good identifier for good old parallel
SCSI that most of our SCSI code still is assuming.
That will change one day ...
