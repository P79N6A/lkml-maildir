How does the Philips WebCam (pwc/pwcx) issue affect the speedtch 
project? AIUI, that project requires additional proprietary microcode to 
work.
The ramifications are potentially huge...

(current maintainer of speedtouchconf.sf.net; hoping to resign soon as 
the speedtouch.sf.net project gains more steam, or the speedtch module 
becomes more popular - either way, reducing the importance of my 
project, and allowing me to resign ;-)
