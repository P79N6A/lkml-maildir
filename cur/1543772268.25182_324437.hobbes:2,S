As I recall, it is not possible to put a timer in the list for the current time. 
  It will be put in the next tick slot or, with HRT, be passed to the hrt code. 
  The only case this might fail is if a kernel hrt user restarts his timer for 
"now" or prior to "now".  This is bad and hard to correct.  The posix-timers 
code does not restart timers until the signal is delivered and then from the 
user thread, not the softirq context.
Did I miss something here?
