Hm. According to my records, the last time we communicated was
20-AUG-2003 and I said basically that I don't usually scan LKML for
FAQ material, and depend on people sending patches in. The FAQ seems
"stable" now (i.e. not that much has changed on the list, some old
flamers have mellowed, new kids have taken their place, traffic is
still high, business as usual).
Oh, BTW: please don't send to my old .au address. I hardly read that
anymore because it receives too much spam and I have not yet
succeeded in getting it shut down responsibly.
