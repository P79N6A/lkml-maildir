Yes, Intel has never done that. They'll probably never do it since it'll 
break a lot of system software (unless they use a new mode-bit that 
allows system software to enable lose-ordering). Although I clearly 
remember to have read in one of their P4 optimization manuals to not 
assume this in the future.
