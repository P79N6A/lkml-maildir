Martin,
I only have extensive experience with Dell's Server platforms.  But because
of the nature of the error, it can happen on any platform using reboot=bios.
On the platforms I was debugging.. invalidating the cache left a bunch of
ADD's in memory followed by a JMP to itself.  So you would see the message
"rebooting system" but then you would never get a blank screen and BIOS
posting (the reboot vector was never called).
