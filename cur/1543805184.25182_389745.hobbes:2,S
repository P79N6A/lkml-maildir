Hi,
since 2.6.16rc1-git3, e100 dies on resume (regardless if from disk, ram or
runtime powermanagement). Unfortunately i only have a bad photo of
the oops right now, it is available from
https://bugzilla.novell.com/attachment.cgi?id=64761&action=view
I have reproduced this on a second e100 machine and can get a serial
console log from this machine tomorrow if needed.
It did resume fine with 2.6.15-git12
