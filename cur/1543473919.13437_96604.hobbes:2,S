Only good fix would be to add a new socket command/option that signals 
forward process for a specific address to the kernel, and change tftp to use 
that.
When the neighbour entry expires the kernel first tries to send an ARP
probe directly to the other end (ucast_solicit). Is your Ultrix box
dumb enough to not answer to these probes?
