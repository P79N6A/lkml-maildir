Where did you see that PMC0 (PERSEL0/PERFCTR0) can only be programmed
to count cpu cycles (i.e. cpu_clk_unhalted)? As far as I can tell from
the documentation, the 4 counters are symetrical and can measure
any event that the processor offers.
If you look at the perfmon x86-64 patch, you will see that under certain
circumstances, we enable CR4.pce. The main motivation is to alloc reading
counters at ring 3 with RDPMC. By default, CR4.pce must be cleared for
security reasons (covert channel). Perfmon only allows RDPMC for
self-monitoring threads or upon special request.
