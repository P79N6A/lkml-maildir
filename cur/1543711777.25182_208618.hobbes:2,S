Not quite sure what Bill is converying here with the qualifier 'non-static'.
My inclinations lay more toward looking for improvements, explored in
other messages on a concurrent thread "[PATCH] Introduce nodemask_t
ADT", to the cpumask API, to be followed by a kerneldoc, rather than
trying very hard to document the current API much more.
