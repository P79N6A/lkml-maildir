Dear Sir, 
I got your email contacts here in asylum camp where i currently reside for refuge on my going through a magazine and decided to contact you with faith for this help. My sources of your contact gave me the courage and confidence to contact you. It is my pleasure to contact you sir though I have not met with you before pleading you for this help, but i want you to consider it as the will of God for my knowing who you are. 
I am Ms. Linda Mike 24 years old, the only daughter of the former minister for Defence and Interior in Sierra Leone Engr. Samuels Mike. There is this ($5,500,000.00 DOLLARS) which my late father kept in a bank before he was assassinated by unknown persons from the rebels after the new political crisis in my country in 1994. 
Sir I waited for so long before I decided to recover the money to start up my life in your country or anywhere save enough outside Africa for security of my life. I want you to help me claim and retrive the money from the bank with the documents I have here with me and transfer it into your personal account in your country for my future life purposes and on profitable investment. Please if you can be of assistance to me, I will be pleased for you tell me what you will be your offer out of the total money so I can use the rest to start up my life. Please Sir, I want you to know that it will require money according to the bank on my last discussion with the manager, this is the reason I cried unto you for Godly help to get this money out of the bank. 
I await your soonest response through here if you can consider my plight and help me out. 
Your's Daughter,
Ms. Linda Mike.
