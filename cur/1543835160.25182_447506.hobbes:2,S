The load isn't the problem. The incurred latencies - both interrupt and
scheduling - are. Audio playback skips, mice losing sync, keyboards
losing keystrokes, these are the nasty effects I've seen so far.

The Analog Devices ADXL2xx sensors in the HDAPS are not implementing
I2C, only having analog and PWM outputs. I doubt they're connected over
I2C to the EC.

The timer interrupt still has to happen every time their select() or
sleep() expires, with the system having to wake up, even when nothing
happened. Polling from userspace is bad.

Every (I2C, direct ADC and more) sensor is polling-based by nature. The
eventization can happen in the EC, the BIOS, or later in the chain -
kernel or userspace. The earlier you stop it, the better for your power
consumption.
On event-based interface, the program using it doesn't have to use
events (it still can read the immediate values explicitly), on a
polling-based interface nobody can use events.
The event-based interface can even signal a certain device will not
supply any events and needs to be polled. This would the interface to
match the hardware better at the expense of making it more complex.

NOTE: I'm arguing event-based vs poll-based here. This is orthogonal to
the /dev vs /sys - both can supply or not supply events.
It's two lines in C, if you omit error checking.
	fd = open("/dev/bat0", O_RDONLY);
	ioctl(fd, BATCGVOLTAGE, &voltage);
for the sysfs implementation (for comparison), you'll need (at minimum):
	fd = open("/dev/bat0", O_RDONLY);
	read(fd, buf, MAX_LEN);
	voltage = strtol(buf, buf + MAX_LEN, 10);
If you want a shell script, you'd use a small utility supplied with the
reference implementation:
	batstate -t voltage /dev/bat0
And it'd of course give you the same output as the 'cat' line.

The current well known methods are:
	1) udev/hotplug. It can create device nodes and symlinks based on the
		capabilities and IDs of an input device.
	1a) HAL. It has all the info from hotplug as well.
	2) open them all and do the capability checks / IDs yourself.
	3) (obsolete, deprecated) parse /proc/bus/input/devices, which
		lists all the input devices
Any problems with that?
