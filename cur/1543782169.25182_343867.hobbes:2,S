Unfortunately, it is quite common out there. I need to somehow keep
those bug reports off my mailbox.
Okay, this should be enough:
Q: What information is usefull for debugging suspend-to-disk problems?
A: Well, last messages on the screen are always useful. If something
is broken, it is usually some kernel driver, therefore trying with as
little as possible modules loaded helps a lot. I also prefer people to
suspend from console, preferably without X running. Booting with
init=/bin/bash, then swapon and starting suspend sequence manually
usually does the trick. Then it is good idea to try with latest
vanilla kernel.
"Known problematic" modules are; be sure to unload them before
suspend:
- DRI being used (3D acceleration)
- Firewire
- SCSI
