--------------------->
The TIMER_SOFTIRQ runs the hrtimers during bootup until a usable
clocksource and clock event sources are registered. The switch to high
resolution mode happens inside of the TIMER_SOFTIRQ, but runs the
softirq afterwards. That way the tick emulation timer, which was set up
in the switch to highres might be executed in the softirq context, which
is a BUG. The rbtree has not to be touched by the softirq after the
highres switch.
This BUG was observed by Andres Salomon, who provided the information to
debug it.
Return early from the softirq, when the switch was sucessful.
Remove also the superfluid hres_active check on top of
hrtimer_switch_to_hres(), as we never get there, once we switched over.
