Hello..
	I've installed Debian 2.1 (Slink) that includes kernel 2.0.36. Later, I've
installed kernel 2.2.10. Then, when I tried to compile some software (ie:
vmware), this legend appears:
	"You have kernel 2.2.10 but include files are from kernel 2.0.36".
	The question is: When upgrading kernel, do I need to upgrade include files
of /usr/include with new kernel files on /usr/src/linux/include? do I need
to make some symbolic links? which ones? Can somebody send me specific
information about what I need to "upgrade"?
								Best Regards...
