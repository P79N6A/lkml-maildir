..and now half of LKML scurries to find a copy of the ANSI C specs..
I'm still browsing a copy here, but so far have only really found this:
  A volatile declaration may be used to describe an object corresponding
  to a memory-mapped input/output port or an object accessed by an
  aysnchronously interrupting function.  Actions on objects so declared
  shall not be "optimized out" by an implementation or reordered except
  as permitted by the rules for evaluating expressions.
Still lots of document left to go through, so I suppose it might
contradict itself later on.
And of course this is only a language spec, not Real Life (tm).
Cheers
