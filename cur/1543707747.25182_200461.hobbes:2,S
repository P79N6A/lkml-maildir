Yes, that, together with O_CLEAN would work.
The problem is that you'd still need other system calls: it's not like 
open(O_CREAT) is the only way to create a file. So you'd have to add 
versions of "link()" etc, which means that O_CLEAN is really pretty 
pointless, and you might as well just do it in a new system call.
Your version is also not multi-threaded: you can never allow more than one 
thread doing the "sys_mark_dir_clean()". That was the reason for having 
two bits: so that anybody can do a lookup in parallell, and only the 
"filldir" part needs to be serialized.
So I do believe you'd want two bits anyway.
