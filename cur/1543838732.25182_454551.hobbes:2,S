Booming stocck markets explained with ready strategies
Fellow Invvestor, big news are hitting on thursday for A GAO!!!
Somebody knows something...place AGA O on the radar!!!
Get ready for a volatile 2nd half of 2006 - one where the Bulls and 
Bears will BOTH be proved wrong. But odds are, we'll see another 
year where the makret indexes bounce around a lot without really going anywhere. And we'll also see certain sectors - favored at this point in the economic cycle - SOAR... 
Own the right sttocks, in the right space, and you could reap a 
handful of money-doublers. But if you own the wrong investment, you could easly lose 25%-35% or more! 
Here is my Favorite Pick for the second half of 2006: AG AO!!!

Needs must when the devil drives When yuh buy ah dutty calico yuh gat fuh wear am till it tear.. Experience is a wonderful thing It enables you to recognize a mistake when you make it again  It is what is in the mind when sober, that comes out of the mouth when drunk  Cut your coat according to your cloth.
Who feels guilty, feels responsible.
