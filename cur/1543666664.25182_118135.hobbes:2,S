Hi, 
While playing with 2.5.65 and 2.5.64-mm8 I've been able 
to reproduce audio skipping with XMMS while moving a 
large window on my KDE desktop (no other CPU-bound 
process except "kdeinit" waking up periodically to steal 
1-3% CPU). What's really curious is that after some time, 
the scheduler seems to adjust in such a way that I can't 
reproduce the audio skip anymore easily. 
In 2.5.64-mm8 it's easier to avoid sound skipping by 
adjusting "max_timeslice" to a 25 or lower. However, on 
2.5.65, I must wait for the scheduler to do its magic. After 
that time, dragging the window over the screen (either 
very fast or very slowly) does not always reproduce the 
audio skip. 
Thanks! 
   Felipe
