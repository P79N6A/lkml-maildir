What's new is that I forgot to turn it off, I'd been running 2.6.5-cko1, 
built 2.6.5-mm1, booted up and installed nvidia kernel for it. I ended 
up with a trashed HD which needed reformatiing and a fresh install. I 
don't know what symptoms I should have seen, perhaps nvidia failing to 
work. I suspect it was a combination of 4K_STACKS and some hardware bug 
for which I am going to change the motherboard, memory and Athlon CPU as 
I've had odd hangs during boot. A few boots hung, finally I disabled 
level 2 cache and it came up, so I think I will leave the next bootup 
till the new stuff is installed. I previously had a hard drive that 
would not boot fully after starting X with nvidia, though it's mountable 
as hdc1 and I can get at all the stuff I need.
Regards
Sid.
