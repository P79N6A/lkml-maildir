Hello all.
Please update site! Href at "C" at 2.6.x link to one place.
Also i will be happy if in site i can go to last -stable git tree
(patches queued to be released at current stable kernel).
Now we see:
The latest prepatch for the stable Linux kernel tree is:
The latest snapshot for the stable Linux kernel tree is:
and we see on it 2.6.29 what not released and have many not tested features.
maybe change to:
The latest snapshot for the stable Linux kernel tree is: 2.6.28-git?
The latest prepatch for the testing Linux kernel tree is: 2.6.29-rc?
The latest snapshot for the testing Linux kernel tree is: 2.6.29-rc?-git?
And users can get fresh patches to 2.6.28 stable kernel or see it?
Thanks.
Best regals, Badalian Vyacheslav aka Slavon
