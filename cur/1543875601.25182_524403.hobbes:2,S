You can't do that.  dev->dev.driver_data is used by this very driver
itself to store its own data, or alternatively the parport_serial
driver to store its private data.  Therefore, dev->dev.driver_data
will be corrupted between your _init function setting it and your
_exit function using it.
Suggest you read the iobase back from the device to release it.
