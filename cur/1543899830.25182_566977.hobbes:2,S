I imagine that by "fix" Andi means also updating all callers.  Otherwise
he would just have said "break".

So you disable preemption before calling smp_call_function_single().

That's not correct.  kvm has two places where you can call the new
smp_call_function_single() (or on_cpu()) without disabling preemption. 
There are also a couple of existing places that don't need to disable
preemption with the new semantics (see mtrr_save_state(), do_cpuid(),  
_rdmsr_on_cpu(), all in arch/i386 for examples).  In fact I think more
places can take advantage of the new semantics than not.
