   Unusable, not ACPI nvs or reclaim?
   Hmm.   Mapping it into memory the easy way won't work very well,
   then, because that will make mem_map[] a fairly huge creature indeed
   (I've got some bioses around that glues an unusable segment right up
   at the 4gb boundary; I'd hate to eat 64mb for pagetables on a 32mb
   machine about as much as I'd hate having to poke around inside all
   the rom segments to see if they're special rom or plain ordinary
   rom so I could decide whether to map them into memory or not.)
