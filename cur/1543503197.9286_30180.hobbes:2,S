The list of places using writes to page cachable files from KERNEL_DS
includes:
dump
loopback device on sparse files
write_dquot
nfsd_write
do_acct_process
sendfile
do_write_page (the one which started this whole thread).
Out of all of these, nfsd_write() is the one which kills the idea of
just testing the current fs.  The eventual fix won't be possible to test
in 2.3, however --- the massive cleanups in the entire write
architecture in 2.3 mean that this entire class of cache coherency
problem simply doesn't exist any more.
