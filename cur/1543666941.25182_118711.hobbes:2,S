Hi,
Here is a test:
bash$ md5sum isec-ptrace-kmod-exploit.c 
f3a5c17bf8d207d3f4828020d1bcfa0a  isec-ptrace-kmod-exploit.c
bash$ make isec-ptrace-kmod-exploit   
cc     isec-ptrace-kmod-exploit.c   -o isec-ptrace-kmod-exploit
bash$ ./isec-ptrace-kmod-exploit 
[-] Unable to attach: Operation not permitted
Killed
bash$ id
uid=151(myusername)
gid=151(myusername)
groups=151(mygrpname)
bash$ uname -a
Linux myhostname 2.4.20-9-PE2650-6650 #1 SMP Mon Mar 17 11:22:15 MST 2003 i686 unknown
bash$ 
Thankfully it does work.
Check your binary for suid root.
