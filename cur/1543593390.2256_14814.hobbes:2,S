Hi!
According /usr/src/linux/Documentation/networking/ethertap.txt I've tried
to use ethertap for my experimental user space TCP/IP implementation 
testing. I'm using kernel 2.2.19 (UP).
I load ethertap kernel module and configure it with ifconfig. Nice,
ping works, ifconfig show tap0. /dev/tap0 exists, major and minor is
correct.
But opening /dev/tap0 does not work!
munmap(0x127000, 55843)                 = 0
getpid()                                = 29070
open("/dev/tap0", O_RDWR|O_NONBLOCK)    = -1 ENOSYS (Function not implemented)
open("/dev/tap0", O_RDWR|O_NONBLOCK)    = -1 ENOSYS (Function not implemented)
open("/dev/tap0", O_RDWR|O_NONBLOCK)    = -1 ENODEV (No such device)
write(2, "Cannot open /dev/tap0: No such d"..., 38Cannot open /dev/tap0: No such device
What can be the problem? How can I use /dev/tap0 then? I exactly followed
instructions read in ethertap.txt but it does not work ;-(((
