Well, I wasn't clear enough -- currently we prohibit the *build* of
snd-pcsp driver when input pcspkr driver is built, regardless whether
module or built-in.  The reason is that sysfs spews an error with a
stack trace when the platform name conflicts, and this appears to be a
serious error.  Disabling the build is the simplest solution in such a
case (when considering built-in driver).
Now, with this patch, the platform name conflict appears non-critical,
and the driver should handle properly for the returned error code.
Thus, there shouldn't be a big obstacle to *build* both drivers.
