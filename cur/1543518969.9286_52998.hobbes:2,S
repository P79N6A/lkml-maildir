I stopped reading linux-kernel when that stopped being a newsgroup.
But then some guest of the department left a subscription to the
linux-kernel mailing list, and I started using that.
Don't mail me here - Often I just throw out a few hundred messages -
linux-kernel has too much traffic. My real address remains aeb@cwi.nl.
