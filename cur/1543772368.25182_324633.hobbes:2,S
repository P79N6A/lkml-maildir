Reverse to youe did you read message from the original thread at all ?
Karim supports this work and knows this is possible.

Not an issue. Folks do it all of the time here. There's no hysteria
regarding this here. Single image kernel do it all of the time such as
Mach, QNX, LynxOS and friends.

Read the original thread. Folks have intention of doing more than you
realize at this point. Trivial strawman claims of provable verses
measured latencies are just stupid. The problem is not as wacked you
make it.

Nanokernels crash as well from lack of memory protection. So what ?
You make too many assumptions in domain you have little experience in
and turn it into some assumed fatal argument about single image RT which
is far from reality and the true of the matter.

LynxOS runs on HP printers for real time guarantees all of the time and
is good for general purpose usages as well. Folks use single image kernel
for RT guarantees even before the existence RTAI and RT Linux. Your history
is reversed here. People have been doing this for ages under a single image.

Hard RT is required in audio. It's require in processing DSP data coming
from those cards. ioctl() paths are short and pretty much directly go to
the driver.
