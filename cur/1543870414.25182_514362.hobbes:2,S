One thing I'd like to see is a cmd argument as well, to allow for 
example allocation vs. reservation (i.e. allocating blocks vs. simply 
reserving a number), as well as the inverse of those functions 
(un-reservation, de-allocation)?
If the allocation interface allows allocation/reservation within 
arbitrary ranges, if the only way to un-allocate is via a truncate, 
that's pretty asymmetric.
