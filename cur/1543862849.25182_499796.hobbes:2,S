the stuff that's actually "broken."  :-)
OBSOLETE is not (or at least *should not* be) equivalent to BROKEN.
"OBSOLETE" should denote code that, while it is no longer supported
and has a viable replacement, may very well still work.  and it may or
may not be slated for removal some day.  there may very well be
reasons to keep "obsolete" code in the kernel, for occasional backward
compatibility, but marking it as "obsolete" is a powerful indicator
that people should *really* try not to use it.
"BROKEN" code, OTOH, really should mean exactly that -- code that is
*known* to be broken.  that would include old code that has suffered
bit rot, but it might also include *new* code that, while it's now
part of the kernel, someone discovers a major flaw in it and no one's
got around to fixing it yet.  so even bleeding-edge code can
technically be "broken" until someone gets around to debugging it.
thoughts?
