Subject: Wrong __pa() usages in driver/char/mem.c ?

I'm suprised to find some __pa() usages in a driver. I would
have used virt_to_phys() instead. In my understanding __pa()
is used only during early bootmem init, because this macro
is aware of any weird things that might exist at this early 
stage. But once this stage is completed virt_to_phys() should
be used.
Is this understanding wrong ?
Thanks
