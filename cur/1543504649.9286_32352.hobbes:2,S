What hangs?  The kernel or fsck?
And what do you mean by "hang"?

Try a Ctrl-Scroll lock and see what it's up to.  Is it in the
"D" state?
Is sda6 you root partition?  Is there any swap available when
it dies?
Someone has reported a potential deadlock when no swap is available,
and this sounds just the thing to trigger it.
