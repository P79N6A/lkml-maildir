I know, but there's too much resistance to the "pure" 4kb patch. The
8 KB patch does the same thing (enables 4kb stacks)  and at the same
time the 8kb groupies can't flamewar you for it, it covers akpm's
concerns, it puts some pressure on the ndiswrapper guys and leaves
time for the broadcom driver developers to finish, merge and push
to the distributions their driver. The 8kb config option can be
removed in the future when we're sure that it's 100% safe (neil
brown's patch isn''t a good sign). It makes every happy IMO ;)
