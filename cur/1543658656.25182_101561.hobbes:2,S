Good day!
I think, first of all it's "General Kernel options(features)" to
support SMP(Preempt, MTRR) or not.
And may be would be better to move Processor Family and SubArch menu
to the top level of the menu? Then merge "General setup" and "Processor
type and features" in one menu.
It's just my opinion, no more.
