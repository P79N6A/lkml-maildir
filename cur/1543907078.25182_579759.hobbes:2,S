Good news.
"s2ram --force --acpi_sleep 1 --vbe_mode" works.
I also tried "--acpi_sleep=3", but that doesn't work. Same
text-console messed up.
Tony, Peter, Linus, Rafael, thanks for all your help!!!
With this workaround, I'm all happy on 2.6.23-rc2.
If there's anything else you want to try, please let me know.
Thank you,
Jeff.
