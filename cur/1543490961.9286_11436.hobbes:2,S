	Let me say that it shouldn't.  It use to.  Prior to 2.0.3, there
was a problem.  I'll double check the 2.0.3 tarballs and make sure the
fix for the password cache made it in there.  Before, if you passed the
password on the command line or in the PASSWD environment variable or after
a '%' in the USER environment variable, the password would get cached
for reconnects.  If the password was prompted from the console, it wasn't
cached and the smbmount daemon would be foo when it went to reconnect.
	You could try one of the other methods jsut to determine if it DOES
make a difference.  Maybe I missed some silly case somewhere...
