One last thing: I'm not opposed to cleanups in the least.
What I'm most concerned about is that arch maintainers have their needs
satisfied by whatever internals you choose to back cpumask* with.
In all honesty, what you've been proposing is very close to what I wanted
to have done to begin with. I would be glad to have you (or whoever else
has the wherewithal to push the issue) get things down to the cleanest and
most generally applicable implementation of API or definition of API as
possible.
I have taken issue only where I believe you need to acquire arch maintainer
feedback. IMHO, the changes proposed would be cleanups and more extensible,
but only need the review from arch maintainers to bring them to full
mainline merging. This is an API. When you have semantic equivalence, as
approved by arch maintainers, this has no reason _not_ to go in.
All this said, you have pointed out immediate needs for fixes. Please let
these fixes go through. There is a difference between the best code
possible and what makes things work.
