Or at least a derived structure, however it might as well just use
scatterlist (address member is soon gone). So yes.

Lots of overhead required for copying data back and forth between low
and high page (both the memcpy, but also the highmem kmap). In addition
it puts added pressure on the memory allocator.

Then you should move the the page/len/offset construct.

Hmmm no, I don't think so. It only worked for low mem pages, since it
used page_address to 'map' the page.
