The reason it's done that way is that if the event that causes the
relay_switch_subbuf() happens to be an event logged from schedule(), and
we directly call wake_up_interruptible() at that point, we lock up the
machine because it ends up back in schedule().  Deferring it avoids the
problem.
I don't see any problem with using a plain timer instead - I'll work up
a patch to make that change.
