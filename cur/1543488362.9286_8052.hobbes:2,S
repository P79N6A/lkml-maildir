Going hopefully more on-topic, I don't think MOSIX matters anyhow. I'm
not convinced of the merit of the idea in the first place. If you want
"nice" clustering support, you're probably better off with DIPC
anyway, keeping more of it in user space (but still not all).
And I'm not even convinced about the DIPC model either. I think trying
to pretend a networked cluster of machines is really a single happy
machine with lots of nodes is fundamentally flawed. The right way
(IMNSHO) is to provide a flexible and lightweight API to support
communications (in user space), and write your application *knowing*
you're running on a networked cluster.
Any abstraction that attempts to hide the immutable fact that
inter-node latency is high and bandwidth is low is a *bad*
abstraction. It lulls the programmer into thinking they're writing
efficient code. Local nodes and remote nodes *should* be treated
differently, because they *are* different.
IMO MOSIX/DIPC is the wrong approach.
I'll now stand back and hold out a few marshmallows...
