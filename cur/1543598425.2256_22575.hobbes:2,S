Please check 
http://www.checkpointing.org
.  There are several projects
listed there.
Current general kernel level checkpointing support is still limited (i.e.,
doesn't support all applications in all cases).  Two projects you may want
to check: epckpt (a kernel patch) and CRAK (a kernel module).

Subject: Suspending a process into disk?
> Hello All,

> I was wondering, if suspending a specific process into disk and

> Sometimes, I have to delay a necessary (minor) kernel update
