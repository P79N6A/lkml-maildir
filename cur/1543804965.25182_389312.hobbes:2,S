Eric, agreed.... that was implied by me (but poorly worded). What I meant (lets try this
again) is that the context defines/provides the namespace in which the lookup
is performed, hence as you say state.. naturally things in different containers
(namespaces) are invisible to you..

That's a good idea .. right now we simply did this through a flag left by the call
to the /proc/container fs ... (awkward at best, but didn't break the API).
I have a concern wrt doing it in during fork namely the sharing of resources.
Whe obviously are looking at some constraints here wrt to sharing. We need to
ensure that this ain't a thread etc that will share resources
across "containers" (which then later aren't migratable due to that sharing).
So doing the fork_exec() atomically would avoid that problem.
