It was more of a stress test -- it simply opened a file and immediately
closes it in a tight loop.  2.6.22 survives four of the following running
on a 4-CPU machine.
Attached are the kernel modules I use to measure RCU performance
(and to torture RCU), but they don't really measure completion
performance.  (All licensed under GPL, FWIW.)
						Thanx, Paul
(The following is my reconstruction of the open/close stress test.)
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
	int fd;
	for (;;) {
		fd = open("/dev/null", O_RDONLY);
		if (fd >= 0) {
			close(fd);
		}
	}
}
