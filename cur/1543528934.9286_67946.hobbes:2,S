Another option to consider. Linux currently has a freepage.min below
which only the kernel can alloc memory.
However this doesn't help the admin to telnet/log on and clean up
manually. Would it be possible to add a freepage.root-min. Below which
only euid==0 processes could allocate memory? So that
getty/login/inetd/telnetd could still get memory in the case that a user
process is causing trouble.
(or this is impractical for some reason?)
