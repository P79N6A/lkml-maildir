     I experienced something strange with NFS on 2.2.10, this is the userland
nfsd, not knfsd.
     I have a web server running 2.2.10 (this is the one of the 4-CPU SS-10's
with Ross Hyersparc that keep doing the spin_lock thing)...
     On the web server, a directory used for logging is exported so that it can
be accessed from a shell server.  The shell server is running SunOS 4.1.4.
     The permissions on the logfiles are:
-rw-r-----   1 root     cgibin   10243000 Sep  5 00:01 httpd-log.Sep0499.gz
-rw-r-----   1 root     cgibin   11173520 Sep  6 00:01 httpd-log.Sep0599.gz
-rw-r-----   1 root     cgibin   11136015 Sep  7 00:01 httpd-log.Sep0699.gz
-rw-r-----   1 root     cgibin   13584484 Sep  8 00:01 httpd-log.Sep0799.gz
-rw-r-----   1 root     cgibin   13120229 Sep  9 00:01 httpd-log.Sep0899.gz
-rw-r-----   1 root     cgibin   13313907 Sep 10 00:01 httpd-log.Sep0999.gz
-rw-r-----   1 root     cgibin   13494684 Sep 11 00:01 httpd-log.Sep1099.gz
-rw-r-----   1 root     cgibin   69750667 Sep 12 00:01 httpd-log.Sep1199
-rw-r-----   1 root     cgibin   18688287 Sep 12 09:37 httpd-log.Sep1299
     I am a member of cgibin group.
     As you can see above, the permissions are identical for all of the files,
yet, I can cat httpd-log.Sep1299 but not httpd-log.Sep1199 from the shell
server.  Locally on the machine I can cat either file fine with same user and
group permissions.
     Any ideas what could cause this?
