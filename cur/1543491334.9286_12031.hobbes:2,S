Lokesh,
I think you might find it problematic opening so many file descriptors.
You should consider the activity of the client, my guess is not all clients
will be active at the same time.  Therefore you could have a pool of say
100 sockets (can be any number) that you share amongst the 5000 or 
20000 clients.  In this case each client has a type of virtual connection
in the sense that the client may not actually have an open socket but it
looks and acts as if it did.
Obviously when either the server or the client needs to send anything you
must re-establish the socket connection.
Alternatively, you might be able to define a protocol that sends packets of
data between the client and server.  In this way, the socket is only open
while the packet is being sent.  This might get around your problem of 
having so many sockets open at once, but the process of opening and
closing so many socket connection might be over whelming.
Hope this helps.
Cheers
Craig.
