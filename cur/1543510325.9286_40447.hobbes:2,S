If this is still the 'constant outgoing packet queue length' bug I was
reporting about this time last year, then I've done tcpdumps at either end. I 
don't still have them, though. They'll be in linux-kernel and/or linux-isdn 
archives somewhere if they actually got posted.
A quick dredge through my archives shows up the mail I've included below. 
It doesn't contain the remote tcpdump, but I remember having done it. Not at
the other end of the ISDN link, because that was obviously not a machine I had
control over, but I ran a ping to somewhere else fairly close, and got a
tcpdump from there. It agreed 100% with the local tcpdump which I _did_ include
in the mail below, give or take the expected few milliseconds. It was enough 
to convince me that the packets _really_ are sent at the time the local 
machine thinks they are sent. What you see here is really what's on the wire.
Hopefully this is enough to start the investigation.
I can't reproduce this any more, because after about six months of this we just
ditched the ISDN and installed a leased line instead. The ISDN only comes up 
now when we have stupidly large downloads to loadbalance. We never keep it up 
for long enough to see whether this problem still occurs.

Subject: Outgoing packets queued for ever...
Date: Sat, 07 Nov 1998 01:11:17 +0000
From: David Woodhouse <David.Woodhouse@mvhi.com>
Hello all,
I sent this mail to linux-{kernel,isdn}@vger.rutgers.edu a couple of months 
ago, but received no response (other than others saying that they've seen the 
same problem). So I'm reporting it here, too.
Kernels between 2.1.120 and 2.1.127-pre2 haven't fixed the problem. I have now
established that it can be temporarily fixed by removing the offending ippp
device completely ('isdnctrl delif ippp0') and reconfiguring it, so at least I 
don't have to reboot every time.
