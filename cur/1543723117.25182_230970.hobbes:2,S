Hi,
I have written a RAM disk driver and I want to write
the data to a backup disk/partition while unloading
the driver.
I want to do RAW I/O to a disk/partition from my ram
disk driver. How I can achieve this?
alloc_kiovec(..), map_user_kiobuf(...) and
brw_kiovec(...) functions can be used for this? But
these function map user space into kernel space
memory, but in my driver I will be having only kernel
space memory.
Thanks in advance!
