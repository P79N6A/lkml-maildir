Hello all,
	I just upgraded two systems from 2.2.12 to 2.3.21 now that
smbfs once again compiles.  One system worked fine, the other not
so fine.
	The system that failed has a Logitech MouseMan serial mouse.
Neither GPM or X sees the mouse any longer.  If I boot it into 2.2.12,
it works perfect every time.  If I boot it into 2.3.21, it fails every
time.  I get no mouse movements and no button events.  It's like the
mouse is just dead.  It doesn't even jump around like the protocol
or baud rate was wrong.  Both GPM and X start up, they simply do not see
any events coming back from the mouse.  If I connect to /dev/mouse (or
/dev/ttyS0 where the symlink points) with "cu", cu connects just fine but,
moving the mouse around and clicking the buttons, I don't get anything
out.  If I do that with 2.2.12 I get a nice satisfying long stream of
garbage like I should.
	I built the system by copying my working .config from the 2.2.12
kernel sources to the 2.3.21 sources and doing a "make oldconfig".  The
only thing new that I didn't take the default on was the UDF file system
stuff.  CONFIG_SERIAL is set to y.  This is a RedHat 6.0 system on Intel
i686.
	My other system has a four button Logitech MouseMan Plus wheel mouse
on psaux.  It working just fine.  Unfortunately, all of my other x86
systems all use serial mice, so I'm holding up on them at this point.
	I can't find anything in the Docs which would indicate a change in
this area that could cause this.
	Anyone with any idea what I could be doing wrong?
	Mike
