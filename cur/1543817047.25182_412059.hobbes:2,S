For some users being able to grab a pre-made .config may be valuable,
but for most people I doubt it will be very useful. Peoples hardware
differ a lot, so a "best" config is always going to be one that you
tweak personally to match your system. If you don't want to do that
you are probably just going to use a generic distro kernel anyway (or
you could use the .config of the distro kernel with make oldconfig
when building a new kernel).
Maybe it's a good idea, dunno, but I don't really think so.
