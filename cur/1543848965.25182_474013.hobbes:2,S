How about allocating I/O operations instead of bandwidth ?
So, any read is really a seek+read, and we count that as one I/O
operation. Same for writes.
Since the total "capacity" of the system is typically (in real-world
scenarios) the number of operations (seek+X) rather than the raw
sequential bandwidth anyway, I suppose that I/O operations would be what
you wanted to allocate anyway.
Anyway, just a thought...
(And if you're thinking one sequential reader/writer could then starve
the system; well, count every 256KiB of data to read/write as a seperate
I/O operation even though no seek is needed. That would very roughly
match the raw read/write performance with the seek performance)
