	Sounds good but we have to use this system call after each
accept() which compared with the fd ownership/flags inheritance
is slower. But 1 syscall is better than 4 syscalls.

	If we use small number of listeners (usually one) we
can flag that sigwaitinfo() returned info about activity on
the listener and to accept() the next connections after
ensuring the rt queue is empty. By this way we know that no new
fd is reused after our close() and there is no notification
in the queue for already closed sockets. OK, it is possible
the accept() to be delayed forever if the rt queue never gets
empty, i.e. on very busy server. We can't stop the kernel to
enqueue more and more events.
	I think in normal situations we don't need notifications
from accept(). These events are synchronous. Is there any reason
for these notifications? If the accepted socket is automatically
setup for rt signals we don't need notifications from accept().
But may be they are required if there are still events in the rt
queue for the closed descriptors and we must know the order of
the events.

	But this problem is not only for accept(). We can create
non-socket descriptors and their events must be notified too.
This sounds very complex.
We have two variants:
1. close() to dequeue the events and to do it very fast.
2. If our program closed a fd and sigwaitinfo() returns event
for listener we have to call accept() after the rt queue is empty
or at least after the last event currently in the rt queue.

	In fact, I performed only some tests. But I think we
even don't need to fallback to poll() on SIGIO. I use large
value for the rt queue size (rtsig-max). But may be the overflow can
happen on very busy host? Is there any reason rtsig-max to be
greater than num_possible_sock_events*num_of_possible_async_fd in
current list of supported events ? I.e. for sockets:
2 events (read/write) * 32768 sockets = 65536 ? If I use up to
32768 async fds I need to setup the rtsig-max=65536. If we use
sigwaitinfo() together with the proper socket calls we can't
have more enqueued events? Is this correct? I still didn't tested
how the kernel performs with long rt queue. If we never reach the
rtsig-max why should I need to wait for SIGIO?
	So, what about adding flag to let accept() to copy
the ownership (f_owner) and fd flags (file->f_flags) from
the listener to the connected socket. I don't see other races
if this is the only change to the current kernels. The other
problem is how to ensure that the events are not for already
closed descriptors. May be we can play with different signal
numbers, i.e. we have to check if the signum in the event
is the expected signum for the descriptor. If not, this is
event for old fd. We need min 2 signal numbers for this.
We have to remember which was the last signum used for
this fd and to set another one using F_SETFAST (if added in
the kernel). May be there are other better solutions.
