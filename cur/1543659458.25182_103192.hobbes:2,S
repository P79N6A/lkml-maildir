So the semantics you want are that if A declares a weak symbol S, and
B exports a (presumably non-weak) symbol S, then A depends on B?
I think that's right, given that that is what would happen if A and B
were builtin.
Now, what does Dave think about using weak symbols?  Or is this
Alpha-specific?
Applied,
Rusty.
