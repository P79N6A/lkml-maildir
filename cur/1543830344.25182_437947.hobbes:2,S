Please do.

No you can't. We tried that first, but it generated incorrect code
on older gcc versions. gcc doesn't behave gratefully when an inline
statement takes nearly all register classes (x86-64 has less register
classes than real registers so it's a bit non obvious). I added the 
moves to hide some registers at the advice of gcc hackers.
Maybe you got lucky with newer gcc versions, but I would recommend
to use the standard versions to be backwards compatible.
