And one more thing... the multigate/comx family now has a chanellized E1
card, with the driver not yet included into the kernel, it waits for some
cleanups... It would be nice to have the names of the channels decided at
least by the hw driver, so it could look logical, something like: comx0.0,
comx0.1, etc, which would show that this is is channel 0, channel 1, etc
on the same physical port of the card. This would be impossible if the
protocol driver, allocated devices and device names while it knows nothing
about the logical structure of the hw.
