Our Oracle configuration is on reiserfs on lvm on Mylex.  Our workload 
is not entirely cached, as we are working against an 8GB table, Oracle 
is configured to use slightly more than 1GB of memory, and there is 
always several MB/s of IO going on during our queries.  The "working 
set" of the main table and indexes occupies over 2GB.
Many Thanks,
