I'm seeing these too (hub 5-0):

With 2.6.25 the 2 "unable to enumerate" lines were not there.
The changing order in which USB busses are detected makes comparison 
awkward, but these seem to be the only new lines.
$ lsusb # with 2.6.25-git

Bus 004 Device 002: ID 046d:c50d Logitech, Inc.

Bus 003 Device 002: ID 05a4:9841 Ortek Technology, Inc.

$ lsusb #with 2.6.25
Bus 005 Device 002: ID 046d:c50d Logitech, Inc.
Bus 005 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001
Bus 004 Device 002: ID 05a4:9841 Ortek Technology, Inc.
Bus 004 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001
Bus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001
Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002
Comparing the two there is one "new" device. Strange that "Bus 001" is 
missing in lsusb with 2.6.25 because dmesg does mention it as assigned.
