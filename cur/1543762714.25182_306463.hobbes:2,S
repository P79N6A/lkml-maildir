I mostly agree - there is one case where I think they *might*
be acceptable; (and I think the original poster *may* fall
into this category).
If you are making a very specialist piece of equipment; not
the type of thing you can go and plug into any old PC; but
say an entire box with some obscure piece of hardware in
that no one would want to buy as a seperate add on. I just
don't see the need to force someone to make drivers for
this type of thing public.
Of course the poster could just go and use one of the BSDs
which is probably his safest bet.
