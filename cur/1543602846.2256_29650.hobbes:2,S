  I have been playing with 2.4.9-ac16 and I note that on a small machine
(without the highmem issues) it really seems much slower initially.
After startx I pop up netscape for a test, and it takes almost 50%
longer than 2.4.8-pre3 I've been running since it was new. After that it
seems okay but not wildly better, my aim was to be able to use netscape
and cdrecord and {anything_else} at the same time.
  I'm measuring some figures now, and I have to dig out the location of
the preempt stuff and see if it's in already, or will slide in without
breaking. My bookmarks are on backup while I use the 2nd drive for
something else today :-(
