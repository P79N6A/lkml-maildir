Right, but if you're CPU-bound, then it doesn't matter how long the time-slice
is.  It doesn't matter if your time-slices are 1Hz or 1kHz, except that you
waste less time in switching with a 1Hz rate.  If you arn't really CPU-bound -
you're interacting with the outside world with syscalls - then the timeslice
isn't the issue, its the rate you call syscalls.  And of course, you run long
timeslice processes with a low priority, so an interactive processes will
always get CPU immediately if it needs to.
In general, long timeslices are better than short ones, simply because there's
less overhead.  Latency isn't an issue, because that depends on how you use
syscalls.  A number of schedulers will adjust timeslice quanta depending on the
nature of the load - long slices (multiple seconds) for CPU bound, and shorter
for IO-bound or interactive tasks.

Not quite.  Its the same as being paied $1000/month or $250/wk, but it always
costs $10 to deposit your payment.
