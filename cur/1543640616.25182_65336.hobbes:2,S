You have a system where it actually have the PLL already set and in
66-clock base?  You are the first person to ever hit this BUG().
I will need to work with HighPoint to finish the timing table.
If you would have several device of various max transfer rate limits you
could attach without the driver being built it, it would give me a few
data point to verify if the table I have started is even close.
Cheers,
