Subject: Bad IDE DMA detection in 2.2.5

I reciently upgraded my home system from 2.1.something to 2.2.2 and then to 
2.2.5.  So far everything has worked, but I noticed one oddity.
On the old kernel, it would start getting DMA errors due to the flakey VIA 
chipset in the motherboard.  (It is going to get replaced soon...)  Opon 
detecting the first set of problems, it would disable DMA for that drive.
The 2.2.2 and 2.2.5 no longer do that.  I have disabled DMA with hdparm, but I 
am wondering if this is something that has become broken or was done for some 
good reason.
Another thing I noticed... (I posted on this before, but my mail was scewed 
up, so I may have missed it or it may have been eaten by trolls.)
When I configure 2.2.5 and turn NFS off, it still asks if I want to emulate a 
Sun Server.  Is this to emulate how the Sun reacts to *not* having NFS or is 
it just asking for no particular reason?
