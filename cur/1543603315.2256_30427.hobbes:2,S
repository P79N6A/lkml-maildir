Subject: Modutils 2.5 change, start running this command now

In current modutils, a module that does not export symbols and does not
say EXPORT_NO_SYMBOLS defaults to exporting all symbols.  This is a
hangover from kernel 2.0 and will be removed when modutils 2.5 appears,
shortly after the kernel 2.5 branch is created.
Starting with modutils 2.5, modules must explicitly say what their
intention is for symbols.  That will break a lot of existing modules.
The command below lists the modules on your system that will be
affected.  All code maintainers need to run this against their 2.4
modules and do one of two things.  Either export the required symbols
(remember to add the .o file to export-objs in the Makefile) or add
EXPORT_NO_SYMBOLS; somewhere in the module (no change to Makefile).
 objdump -h `modprobe -l` | \
 awk '/file format/{file = $1}/__ksymtab/{file = ""}/\.comment/ && file != "" {print file}'
