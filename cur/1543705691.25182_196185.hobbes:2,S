Do you disagree that the count does need to be one?

I agree with everything you said, "useful" doesn't always map to "easy." 
But if you agree that the count needs to be one on files, then you could 
also fail if you tried to add it to a directory which was not empty.
In case I didn't make it clear, the use I was considering was to create 
a single directory in which created files would really go away when 
deleted. I hadn't considered doing it after files were present, what you 
say about overhead is clearly an issue. I think I could even envision 
some bizarre race conditions if the kernel had to do marking of each 
file, so perhaps it's impractical.
But what happens when the 'setgid' bit is put on a directory? At least 
in 2.4 existing files do NOT get the group set, only files newly 
created. So unless someone feels that's a bug which needs immediate 
fixing, I can point to it as a model by which the feature could be 
practically implemented.
Comment?
