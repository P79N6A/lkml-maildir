I certainly agree that we shouldn't do volatile just for the fun of it,
and also that use of volatile should be quite rare.

Good point, except that I would expect gcc's optimization to continue
to improve.  I would like the kernel to be able to take advantage of
improved optimization, which means that we are going to have to make
a few changes.  Adding volatile to atomic_get() and atomic_set() is
IMHO one of those changes.

OK, first, I am not arguing that ACCESS_ONCE() can replace all current
uses of barrier().  Similarly, rcu_dereference(), rcu_assign_pointer(),
and the various RCU versions of the list-manipulation API in no way
replaced all uses of explicit memory barriers.  However, I do believe that
these API are much easier to use (where they apply, of course) than were
the earlier idioms involving explicit memory barriers.
But we of course need to keep the explicit memory and compiler barriers
for other situations.
