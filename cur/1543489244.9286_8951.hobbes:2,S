My post wasn't 100% correct: /dev/mouse is a symlink to  /dev/psaux.

I think so:
CONFIG_PSMOUSE=y  (in both linux-2.1.131/.config and
linux-2.2.2/.config).

dmesg, /var/log/boot.msg doesn't contain a detection message with both
kernels.
Other (desktop) machines report PS/2 mouse port detection with 2.2.2 in
dmesg.

2.2.2?
With 2.1.131 the touch-pad works and with 2.2.2 it doesn't  :-.
