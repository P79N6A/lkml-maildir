Hi Stephen,

at least the bz2 tar i just looked at from that URL has a problem
with the prefix resulting to this toplevel extraction:
next-20080222arch
next-20080222block
...
next-20080222virt
So, i guess you just missed the trailing slash for the prefix
parameter of git archive?
(should be --prefix=next-20080222/ afaik)
Thanks,
Frank
