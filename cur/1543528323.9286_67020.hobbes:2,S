Now that pci_ids.h is generated from pci.ids rather than having entries
added only when support for the corresponding devices is written, there
doesn't seem to be an easy way of finding out what devices are supported
(except for looking at the source, of course).
Would there be any interest in having a file in Documentation listing
vendor id, device id, module name and comments to fill this space?
Tim.
