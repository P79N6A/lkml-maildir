I quote from akpm's announcement:
- If some devices mysteriously stop working, try booting with pci=routeirq.
  If that fixes it, please send a report, Cc'ing bjorn.helgaas@hp.com.  See
  remove-unconditional-pci-acpi-irq-routing.patch
That looks like it might help your issue too since the oops talks about pci 
routing.
Cheers,
Con
