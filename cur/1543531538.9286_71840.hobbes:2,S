It seems that there are four possible states:
jumper present or not, JUMPON.EXE used or not.
David Elliott reports (after running JUMPON.EXE)
identify data, where the difference between with and without jumper
is the lba_capacity (66055248 vs 80041248),
and the last short (f9a5 vs e9a5).
If you did not run JUMPON.EXE, what differences do you see?
(That is, what do you get from cat /proc/ide/hdX/identify
without and with jumper?)
