Which kernel version are you using?
I didn't run your test programs, but are you sure you got the hardware

minicom, as that is a program that is known to work properly with these
devices (along with lots of other ones, but that's a good place to
start.)

Yes, setserial does not work with the majority of the usb-serial
drivers, patches gladly accepted to fix this :)
