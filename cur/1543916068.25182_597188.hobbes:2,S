Hi,
Does anybody know why we reserve this range of IO ports for 'fpu'?
AFAIK from all the IO maps I can find on the internet for various x86
chipsets only 0x00f0 is actaully ever used.
./arch/i386/kernel/setup.c
282 }, {
283         .name   = "fpu",
284         .start  = 0x00f0,
285         .end    = 0x00ff,
286         .flags  = IORESOURCE_BUSY | IORESOURCE_IO
287 } };
The reason I ask is that I've written a watchdog driver for a Nexcom
MAX6600 server blade type device which has the watchdog control
register at 0xF2. Currently request_region fails due to the fpu
reservation.
regards,
Pete Fordham
