I had assumed that you didn't want a permission check just for creating a 
key (which is a fairly abstract and inert thing if you don't do anything 
with it), and were only wanting to peform a check when linking.

LSM is supposed to be about access control only, although SELinux and 
Audit are becoming more intimate as time passes.
