If netconsole is enabled, and you hit Alt-Sysrq-t, then it will print a
small amount of output to the console(s) and then hang the system.  In this
case, I'm using the e100 driver, and we end up exhausting the available
cbs.  Since we are in interrupt context, the driver's poll routine is never
run, and we loop infinitely waiting for resources to free up that never
will.  Kernel version is 2.6.5.
No easy solutions jump out at me, unfortunately.  Comments?
Regards,
Jeff
