Looks good.  We also have local_irq_save(), raw_local_irq_save() and
__raw_local_irq_save() which might or might not disable interrupts.  (Do we
really need three flavours of these?)
I guess that people's understanding of spin_lock_irqsave() (note the
irqsave versus irq_save inconsistency) is sufficiently good for nobody to
get tripped up by local_irq_save().  But it's a poor name nonetheless.
It'd be nice to move away from macros too if poss?
