Wrong.
abs() is internal to gcc, and the above is optimized out at compile 
time, so any user of abs() as a function at all is vulnerable.
However, the Linux kernel defines abs() as a macro:
#define abs(x) ({                               \
                 int __x = (x);                  \
                 (__x < 0) ? -__x : __x;         \
         })
... which means gcc never sees it.  So the kernel isn't affected, 
because it doesn't use *gcc's* abs().
