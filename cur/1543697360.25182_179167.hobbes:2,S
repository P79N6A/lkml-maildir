It depends on the chip, on recent ppc64 boxes its 1/8 of the processor
clock speed.

Can you show me the application that depends on timestamps being that
accurate?
Running the multiplier at a set fraction of the processor speed
is a good idea I think. Go look at any large x86 box (and possibly ia64
box) and you will find the timebases are not synced. Even our biggest
box has the timebase synced, its easy to do when the timebase is running
at a reasonable rate.
In a trade off between unsynced timebases and timebase running at a
fraction of the cpu speed, ill take the latter :) (Ask the x86 guys what
a pain unsynced timebases are)
