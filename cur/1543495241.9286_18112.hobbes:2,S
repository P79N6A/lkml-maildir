oops, right. Anyway, vmstat shows that about 200 reschedules per second
happen with 200 running processes:

a reschedule every 5 msecs is not a big overhead at all, considering the
_ridiculous_ CPU load.

you are right, i just knew it's not much overhead and quoted the first
number available, mea culpa :)
