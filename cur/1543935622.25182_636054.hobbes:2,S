That means your callers pass in the wrong values.

No it is testing for all page attributes. That can be cached vs uncached
but also rw vs ro and nx vs non nx and everything else you can set
as bits on ptes.
While changing global sounds weird the pageattr-test code I recently
submitted does just that for test purposes.

There is none, but that is not what change_page_attr() cares about.
It just cares that you pass in the correct bits and you don't currently.
I think you're missing the forrest because of all the trees currently.
