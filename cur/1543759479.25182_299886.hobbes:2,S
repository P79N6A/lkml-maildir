Hello,
I finally succeeded in making my USB scanner work with 2.6.8.1 and above kernels. I remind you I was 
able to see connection/disconnection messages, but not to use it via xsane.
I found the solution on a Debian mailing-list, that worked for me :
cd to /dev
type :
/sbin/MAKEDEV usb
This command created the required character devices. Since USB support has been rewritten between 
2.6.7 and 2.6.8.1 kernels, this was likely to happen when one manually installs a new kernel...
