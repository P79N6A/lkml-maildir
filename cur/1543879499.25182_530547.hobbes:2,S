Subject: [PATCH mm] fix i386 get_gate_vma oops
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Fix oops from i386-make-compat_vdso-runtime-selectable.patch.
Even mingetty at system startup finds it easy to trigger an oops
while reading /proc/PID/maps: though it has a good hold on the mm
itself, that cannot stop exit_mm() from resetting tsk->mm to NULL.
(It is usually show_map()'s call to get_gate_vma() which oopses,
and I expect we could change that to check priv->tail_vma instead;
but no matter, even m_start()'s call just after get_task_mm() is racy.)
