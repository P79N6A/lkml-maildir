Actually, I am plugging in my own data blocks into the skbuff->data
pointer from the drivers themselves.  When the driver allocates an 
skbuff, I use an alternate cache allocator to load the buffer 
into the skbuff, and I leave the two attached.  skb_release_data does
not release one of my data blocks.  These blocks are 4K aligned so 
I am not in the middle of a cache line (I think) in the data portion
when DMA is initiated.

This is probably happening.  I have an Arium here now, and am hooking
it up.  I can get memory bus traces and provide what's actually 
happening on the bus.  I do not ever DMA into a partial cache line.
