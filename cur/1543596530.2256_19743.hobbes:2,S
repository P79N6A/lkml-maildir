Hello,
I don't know whether this is the right place to send this question,
but do you have any software for Linux which allows me to mount
HFS Plus file systems on a Linux 2.4.x kernel?
I am particularly interested in mounting file systems which have
been created under Mac OS 9.1 or Mac OS X.
Thanks.
