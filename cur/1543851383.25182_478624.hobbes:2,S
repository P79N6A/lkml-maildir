Well, at least traditionally, the hotplug locking has caused more problems 
than it has fixed, but at least right _now_ it seems to work.
At least for the one machine I tend to test on (Core Duo Mac Mini) a 
suspend currently works at least once (which is not saying a lot, 
especially as the X server I use right now is broken and doesn't bring the 
screen back. Oh, well).
