Hi,
unfortunately there is still no working driver for the Digital Equipment
Corporation DECchip 21041 card in in kernel 2.6.2.
The de4x5 driver used to work with 2.4.* but causes a lockup immediately
after bringing up the interface when SMP is enabled, it does not even
produce an oops message anymore. See
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1855
With the de2104x driver I can get the network interface up but it fails
to receive any packets.
