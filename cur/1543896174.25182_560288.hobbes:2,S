but the signature isn't part of the kernel, and the code that checks the 
signature is completely independant. and finally the PVR functions are not 
part of the kernel (and not under the GPL in any case)
if your argument was true then Oracle releasing a database appliance would 
require Oracle to give you the source to their database since it's part of 
'bringing about a certain result' namely operating as a database server.
if your argument was true then releasing a GPL package for windows would 
require that the windows kernel source be released, after it it's 
nessasary for 'brining about a certain result' namely letting your code 
run.
these are both nonsense results.
