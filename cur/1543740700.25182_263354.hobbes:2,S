Hi all!
After some more testing after the previous post of the OOPS in 
generic_delete_inode, we have now found a gigantic memory leak in Linux 2.6.
[789]. The scenario is the same:
File system: EXT3
Unpack and delete linux-2.6.8.1.tar.bz2 with this Bash while loop:
let "i = 0"
while [ "$i" -lt 10 ]; do
   tar jxf linux-2.6.8.1.tar.bz2;
   rm -fr linux-2.6.8.1;
   let "i = i + 1"
done
When the loop has completed, the system use 124 MB memory more _each_ time.... 
so it is pretty easy to make a denial-of-service attack :-(
We have tried the same test on a RHEL WS 3 host (running a RedHat 2.4 kernel) 
- and there is no problem.
Any deas?
