One thing I forgot to note...
In regards to the 0x1E0 offset, I'm not sure that it shouldn't be
0x1E4. There is a 4 byte signature, then a 480 byte space, then
the useful fsinfo information. I still wonder where the magic number came
from, I wonder if there is some way this additional offset should be
'calculated' rather than have it be a static number.
