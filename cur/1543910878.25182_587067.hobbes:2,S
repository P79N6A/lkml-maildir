Suffering from terminology overdose here: "fully traditionally 
virtualized, fully-paravirtuallized, para-fullyvirtualized".
Since this is only for newer kernels, won't updating the driver to use a 
hypercall be more efficient?  Or is this for existing out-of-tree drivers?

Ah, seems the answer to the last question is yes.
