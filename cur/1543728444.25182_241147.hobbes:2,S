Tweak the profile code to detect that the instruction pointer is in the
out of line spinlock code and replace the ip with the caller's ip.  We
already do that for ia64, where the out of line spinlock code is a big
win.  A kdb backtrace on an ia64 contended lock will even decode the
address of the lock, which is only possible because the lock address is
in a known location for this case.
