Eric, beyond wanting all processes scheduled at the same time we also
want separation and real isolation (CPU and memory-wise) of processes
belonging to different users. The first emails in the thread describe
the requirements well. They are too complex to be simply handled by
cpus_allowed and mems_allowed masks, basically a hierarchy is needed
in the cpusets allocation.

Cpusets and alike have a long history originating from ccNUMA
machines. It is not simply simulating replicating cluster
behavior. Batch schedulers may be an unelegant solution but they are
reality and used since computers were invented (more or less).

You seem to be suggesting a gang scheduler!!! YES!!! I would love
that! But I remember that 2 years ago there were some emails from
major kernel maintainers (I don't exactly remember whom) saying that a
gang scheduler will never go into Linux. So ... here's something which
somewhat simulates that behavior. Anyhow, cpusets makes sense (for
isolation of resources) anyway, no matter whether we have gang
scheduling or not.
