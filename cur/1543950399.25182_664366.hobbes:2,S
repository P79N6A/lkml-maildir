Subject: [PATCH] fix xt_time_match() never matches on Sundays

xt_time_match() in net/netfilter/xt_time.c in kernel 2.6.24 never matches on
Sundays.  On my host I have a rule like
    iptables -A OUTPUT -m time --weekdays Sun -j REJECT
and it never matches.  The problem is in localtime_2(), which uses
    r->weekday = (4 + r->dse) % 7;
to map the epoch day onto a weekday in {0,...,6}.  In particular this gives 0
for Sundays.  But 0 has to be wrong; a weekday of 0 can never match.
xt_time_match() has
    if (!(info->weekdays_match & (1 << current_time.weekday)))
        return false;
and when current_time.weekday = 0, the result of the & is always zero, even when
info->weekdays_match = XT_TIME_ALL_WEEKDAYS = 0xFE.
The solution is to map Sunday onto 7, not 0.  Either of the following patches
does it; they're equivalent.  The first is more compact, the second is probably
clearer.  With the patch (#1) installed, I've confirmed on my host that
'iptables -m time --weekdays Sun' matches again.
Andrew.
