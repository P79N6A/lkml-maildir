I have two questions:
1. What does "CYA" mean?
2. How do you know which device nodes exist on my workstation?
Actually, I am using /dev/cpu/0/microcode as the device node (entry point
into the microcode driver) because that is what is in the distribution I
am running (old Red Hat).
The microcode_ctl utility had a hardcoded default "/dev/cpu/microcode" and 
there is no real reason to change it because different distributions 
prefer a different value, so how to decide who is "right"?
Also, there is no obvious reason why the future has to be in any way
different from the present (or the past :)
Kind regards
Tigran
