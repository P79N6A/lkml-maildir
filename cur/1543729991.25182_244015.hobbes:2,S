So you just like to tell us that you have no clue?
If the owners and permissions of the filesystem have been set up correctly,
then there is no security problem. 
As there is no problem in the kernel, why change the kernel?
The modification only breaks compatibility and causes trusted applications
like cdrtools to fail if installed suid root.
The change _only_ affects programs that open the /dev/ nodes with euid root
and later revert to a different user id. 
Programs that do not run with euid root cannot open the /dev/ nodes if owner
and permissions have been set up correctly.
