0-4GB is where I need to allocate, so allocating from highmem is not 
a solution.  I found the Ingo/Andrea patch for RH 8.0, but this patch 
looks a little scary since it affects the memory allocations between
user and kernel space and the ratios alloted to these areas (I may 
be missing something here -- as Dave M. puts it "Jeff you are such a pain
in the ass sometimes"  :-).
