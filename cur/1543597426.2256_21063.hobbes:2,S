Hello,
I have a data point that may be of some value.  I have 3 athlon systems
running a variety of FreeBSD/NetBSD/Linux and I experience rock solid
stability, even with K7 optimized 2.4 kernels.  The things that seem to
be different for me are that:
	1) I always use scsi disk subsystems (adaptec or symbios).
	2) I do not use nvidia graphics cards.
My boards are Abit (kt7raid, kt7) and Asus (a7v).  I have taken no special
power supply precautions beyond using AMD certified units.  I'm very curious
as to why I have had such an excellent experience (I'm unlikely to purchase
an intel cpu at this point), even though I use the dreaded via chipsets. 
I hope that someone finds this useful.  I'd be happy to supply configs or
other details if desired.
