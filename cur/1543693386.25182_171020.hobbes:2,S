That's the acknowledgment I'm talking about.

I know.  I wasn't talking about any acknowledge after actually writing
the data to the medium.

Again, I'm NOT talking about write-cache problems.  I'm talking about
problems in the communication/handshaking between the kernel and
the drive.

That reliability figure is for the _drives_.
That figure obviously does not apply to kernel-to-drive communication,
because I've had dozens of DMA-interrupt corruptions in the last two
or so years.

I'm not talking about problems related to write caches.  I'm talking 
about DMA interrupt problems.  Why do you think I'm talking about
inside-the-black-box write-cache problems?

Rock solid?  Hah!  If file system (and other disk-related) code is so 
solid why did my root partition get screwed so badly it can't boot?  
(Even if it's bad hardware's fault that an interrupt got lost, and 
even if it's unreasonably complicated (or impossible) for the
kernel to retry an unacknowledged command, why didn't the kernel
stop writing to that disk after the first unacknowledged command?)

It's not "has been"--it is still a problem, in the newest (is .22 
still the newest) released stable kernel.
