   i'm tried using the first beta release of bind 9.1.0 on an ultra 5
   running 2.4.0-test11 or test12 (modified redhat 6.2 distro -- mostly
   ipv6-related mods).  as soon as i start up named, the machine goes nuts
   and continuously prints the following oops (from test12):
Is this the first OOPS it prints out?  I don't think so.  I am
very sure it printed out messages from die_if_kernel first and
we need that initial OOPS to diagnose this bug and fix it.
All the rest of the OOPS messages are useless and won't tell
us what the real problem is.
Later,
