As a user I'd like to see md/nbd be extended to cope with unreliable links.
I think md could be better in handling link exceptions. My unreliable memory 
recalls sporadic issues with hot-plug leaving md hanging and certain lower level 
errors (or even very high latency) causing unsatisfactory behaviour in what is 
supposed to be a fault 'tolerant' subsystem.
Would this just be relevant to network devices or would it improve support for 
jostled usb and sata hot-plugging I wonder?
