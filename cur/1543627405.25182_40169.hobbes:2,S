The reason I asked, is the description sounded specific to ext3.  Also
with ext3 a supported way to shutdown is to just pull the power on the
machine.  And the filesystem comes back to life without a full fsck.
So if this can happen when all you need is to replay the journal, I
have issues with it.  If this happens in the case of damaged
filesystem I don't.
