Our MPI-based applications involve communicating processes where message
delivery times have to be on the order of 100-200 MICROseconds, not 200
milliseconds.  Therefore, Nagle is turned off via the TCP_NODELAY socket
option, and switched fast ethernet is used.  Data aggregation suitable
for a fast typist is an impediment to MPI, where delays must be 1000
times shorter.  
Sincerely,
Josip
