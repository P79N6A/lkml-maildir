Dear folks,
Our server was unable to mount or umount loop devices mounting iso
images; the same problem occurred in 2.4.2-pre[34] and 2.4.2: an
absolute disaster for us; we had to reboot to another kernel just to
make initrd images to boot off SCSI, let alone make software available
to our staff and students.
Now 2.4.2-ac5 works beautifully for us.  Thank you to Jens Axboe, Andrea
Arcangeli and Al Viro.  And Alan for putting it together.
