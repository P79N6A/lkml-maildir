rmap still sucks on large systems though. I'd love to see rmap
in the main kernel, but it needs to get the scalability fixed first.
The main problem seems to be pagemap_lru_lock ... Rik & crew 
know about this problem, but let's give them some time to fix it 
before rmap gets put into mainline ....
