Hi Henrique,
thanks alot. your explanation answered some important questions of mine.
I need to get deep into this though, and yet understand how to interpret the 
(unsigned32 variable) "cmd" into a function name in my drivers and etc.
120	int stat = ioctl(dev, cmd, arg);
(gdb) p cmd
$1 = 1615069522
(gdb) p dev
$2 = 5
(gdb) p arg
$3 = (void *) 0x8050d30
can you advise me on what to read ? or where to go from here ?
do you know of any resources on the internet regarding kernel, system calls, 
etc ? or which group/mailing list would be the optimum choice for me ?
thanks,
Salman
