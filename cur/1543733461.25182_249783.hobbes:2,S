Indeed.  A pathname based operation would be useful for any fs with
"added features".  For example, on NTFS it could be used to preserve
named streams and extended attributes which would otherwise be lost. 
Mind you, the current NTFS driver cannot create files yet so it will be
a while until such a "copyfile()" is useful there...
