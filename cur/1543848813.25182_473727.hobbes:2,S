Why shouldn't they be? The whole idea is having just /parts/ (hopefully the
ones in active use) in memory.

I don't know what this is supposed to mean...

Each process has its own page tables, they don't get in each others
hair. And the page tables precisely manage making several processes get
access to the /same/ logical addresses, but at /different/ physical
addresses.
