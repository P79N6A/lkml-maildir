The issue, as I see it, is not that the nifty new ioctl doesn't become 
instantly available, although that's not a small benefit of having one 
and only one set of user headers. The real benefit is avoiding the case 
where some part of the API *changes* and some feature stops working.
This is obviously uncommon, but not unheard of.
I see the greatest benefit from just not having two sets of headers, I 
believe all that stuff I learned in CS classes about not having two 
copies of stuff and assuming that they're the same. It would be less 
work to clean up the headers once, and let the folks who now maintain 
the separate headers become the "kernel janitors" to keep it clean.
Not my job, but we have someone offering to do the first cut at it, and 
it seems a desirable end result.
