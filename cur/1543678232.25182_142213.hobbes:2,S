The first step towards finding that out is power cycling (shut down,
switch off for a minute, then start up again) or physically
disconnecting the Yamaha drive (if it's Yamaha).
I've seen Adaptecs fuss and fight with Yamahas more than once --
although in Linux 2.2 and early 2.4 times -- and Yamahas have the nasty
habit of locking up until the next power cycle when something goes
wrong.

It might be either, I'd suspect the CDRW first unless I had information
that suggests otherwise.
Try to find out.
