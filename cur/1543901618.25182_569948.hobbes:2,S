That's a possibility, I admit I haven't benchmarked it.  I will say that
I don't think it will be enough to matter - msleep() is not a hot-path
sort of function.  Once the system is up and running it almost never
gets called at all - at least, on my setup.
> One question here would be, is it really a problem to sleep a little more?
"A little more" is a bit different than "twenty times as long as you
asked for."  That "little bit more" added up to a few seconds when
programming a device which needs a brief delay after tweaking each of
almost 200 registers.

Except that then, with the current implementation, you're paying for the
higher HZ whenever the CPU is busy.  I bet that doesn't take long to
overwhelm any added overhead in the hrtimer msleep().
In the end, I did this because I thought msleep() should do what it
claims to do, because I thought that getting a known-to-expire timeout
off the timer wheel made sense, and to make a tiny baby step in the
direction of reducing the use of jiffies in the core code.
