	But but but...almost from the day they were introduced.  And
these are more recent probs. Has stack usage increased for some reason,
:-(.  I do have the option to detect stack-overflow turned on as well
-- guess it doesn't work so well?
	If they are that problematic, maybe selecting xfs as a config
option should force 8k stacks (ugly solution, but might eliminate
some lost hair (from pulling it out) for end users....?
	Guess I should go back to 8k's for now...seems odd that it'd
pop up now, but maybe it's the xtra NFS loading?  Sigh.
