Hi,
        I recently did some hardware switching in my house and need to know
how to switch the detection of the aic7xxx controllers in the kernel.  I've
got a 7880 on the motherboard and a 2940u2w in there but the motherboard 
card only has a 68 pin connector.  The bios detects the 2940u2w first but
Linux reverses it so the 7880 is done first.  With 2.3.12 I can use 
"aic7xxx=reverse_scan" but that doesn't seem to do anything on 2.3.29.  I've
tried "pci=reverse" but that also didn't seem to have an effect.  Is there 
another argument I should pass to the kernel or am I going to have to try
hard coding it?
Thanks
