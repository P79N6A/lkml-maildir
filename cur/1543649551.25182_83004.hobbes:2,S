You will never understand, that <insert evil vendor here> can simply
add this modification to the kernel source ("vendor tree"), give this
source away under GPL license and then ship its binary kernel modules
with the source tree.
You won't be able to stop anyone doing this "illegal" thing. But you
hinder many legal users of this.
Not putting an export into the source or exporting GPL_ONLY symbols
won't hinder anyone. Because putting the hooks into a GPL source and
then releasing the result (code + hooks) under GPL is perfectly legal.
The only result are questions on this list, why the <insert your video
card / network / hw driver here> module works under "foobar" Linux and
not with the pristine sources.
Ah and lots of patches like "please put this into the kernel so I can
use the <insert your video card / network / hw driver here> module.
