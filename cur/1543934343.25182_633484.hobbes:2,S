I'm not sure "way too expensive" is appropriate. I'm using Seagate 320GB 
"NS" drives instead of "AS" models, and at the time I bought them they 
were $100 vs. $95 and are now $95 vs. $85. Other sizes and vendors have 
similar price points. A 10-15% premium seems reasonable for the 
firmware, faster access, and a general assurance that the drive is 
intended for 7/24 use.
On a small home array the cost is minimal, and if you are running 
desktop drives in huge arrays 7/24 you probably are doing other cost 
cutting tradeoffs to reliability, it's a choice.

Just in general I agree, I'd like to see the error reported back up and 
let the user make the decision. One of the benefits of Linux is that it 
lets you make your own decisions, even bad ones. Windows assumes it owns 
the computer, you're an idiot, and it will let you use your computer if 
you do it their way.

Not so much, with rewrites of sectors where possible this problem is 
less common than it was. But I agree on the drive kicking option, more 
control is good. However, the timeout should be in the driver, not in 
the raid code, that's where it belongs. The kernel copes with errors 
better than having a drive go practice self-gratification for minutes at 
a time.
