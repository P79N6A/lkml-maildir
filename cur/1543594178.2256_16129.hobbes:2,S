This still doesn't make sense if the disk bandwidth isn't being used.

There are two cases, file-backed and swap-backed pages.
For file-backed pages what we want is pretty simple: when 1) disk bandwidth 
is less than xx% used 2) memory pressure is moderate, just submit whatever's 
dirty.  As pressure increases and bandwidth gets loaded up (including read 
traffic) leave things on the inactive list longer to allow more chances for 
combining and better clustering decisions.
There is no such obvious answer for swap-backed pages; the main difference is 
what should happen under low-to-moderate pressure.  On a server we probably 
want to pre-write as many inactive/dirty pages to swap as possible in order 
to respond better to surges, even when pressure is low.  We don't want this 
behaviour on a laptop, otherwise the disk would never spin down.  There's a 
configuration parameter in there somewhere.
