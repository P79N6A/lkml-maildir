You can compare the old development model with the new development 
model, and if you think the progression is a regression it's not 
reactionary but simply correct to ask for going back to the old model.
It's a bit like at the height of the "new economy" hype:
"Reactionary" people who didn't believe in the wonders of the
"new economiy" but bought "old economy" stocks (or no stocks at all) 
lost less money.
