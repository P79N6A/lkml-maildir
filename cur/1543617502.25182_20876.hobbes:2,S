There is some problem with iptables modules and kernel 2.4.17 ?
I'm using 2.4.10 and it works fine; I tried on another computer at work the 
2.4.17 but I got unresolved symbol errors
ip_tables.o: unresolved symbol nf_unregister_sockopt
ip_tables.o: unresolved symbol nf_register_sockopt
I downloaded 2.4.16 and compiled with the same configuration and it works fine.
I have Slackware 7.0
Please CC me for the reply.
Thanks.
