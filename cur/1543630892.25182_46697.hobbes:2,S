Don't guess, look:
    # kill "PATCH" tag
    s/^\s*\[PATCH\]//;
    s/^\s*PATCH//;
    s/^\s*[-:]+\s*//;
    # strip trailing colon
    s/:\s*$//;
    # kill leading and trailing whitespace for consistent indentation
    s/^\s+//; s/\s+$//;
So it should not harm "[ARM PATCH]".
What we would want is only remove the tag when we have symmetric square
brackets. What we also want is simplicity to allow for easy maintenance
and, last but not least, simple, anchored regexps for speed.
