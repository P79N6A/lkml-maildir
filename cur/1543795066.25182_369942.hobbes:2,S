In order to prevent the problems mentioned AND satisfy SuS, I would 
think that the st_dev field would be the value which should be unique, 
which is not always the case currently. The st_inod is a file id on 
st_dev, and it would be less confusing if the inode on each st_dev were 
unique. Not to mention that some backup programs do look at that st_dev 
and could be mightily confused if the meaning is not determinant.
Historical application usage assumes that it is invariant, many 
applications were written before pluggable devices and network mounts. 
In a perfect world where nothing broke when things were changed, if 
there were some UUID on a filesystem, so it looks the same mounted over 
network or by direct mount, or loopback mount, etc, then there would be 
no confusion.
A backup API would really be nice if it could somehow provide some 
unique ID, such that a netowrk or direct backup of the same data would 
have the same IDs.
