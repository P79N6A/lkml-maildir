I don't know why the support for fastrouting was removed from the
tulip-driver (the only real driver I think ever had it).
If you are interested in a tulip-driver that has excellent performance
(even without fastrouting) and has support for fastrouting take a look at
this:
ftp://robur.slu.se/pub/Linux/net-development/tulip-ss010402-poll.tar.gz
this driver can route over 200k pps _without_ fastrouting on a pII 350.
(this is obvious with more than two interfaces or with traffic in both
directions)
This driver is both irq-driven and polling, it polls at high loads.
