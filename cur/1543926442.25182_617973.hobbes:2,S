..
Yes.  It's particularly nasty because, as of yet, I haven't seen anything
to lead me to conclude *which* kernel subsystem is locking up.
It could be the block layer.
It could be some PPC arch bug.
It could be mm.
It could even be the CPU scheduler.
Those messages above could help.
Now we just need somebody to interpret them,
and examine the code paths that follow to see
where it might be possible to get stuck.
The SCSI/libata layers by themselves could lock up the I/O,
but not the entire machine..
Cheers
