Depends on what you do. Do you compile kernels regularly? In
particular, do you have to wait for them, or do you just let them sit
in the background, and come back to them when you rememeber, since
you've been busy doing real work for the past 5 hours? If you wait,
then I guess you want high swapiness.
For the rest of us who don't have to regularly read in hundreds of
megs of disk, and don't need to use that hundreds of megs of disk over
and over and over again (As far as I can see, this is just about
everyone who's not a kernel developer or some big app developer[1]), I
guess we get by just fine having smaller swapiness.
[1] Maybe kde is bloated enough that you if want to start the equiv of
an xterm all the time, maybe caching helps a lot there, but I make a
point of using lean apps[2].
[2] Sad when you consider xemacs lean, isn't it? ;)
