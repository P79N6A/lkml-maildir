We're at -rc2 and I only have only maybe 100 patches tagged for 2.6.15 at
this time.  The number of actual major features lined up for 2.6.15 looks
relatively small too.
As I said, famous last words.  But we have to finish this thing one day ;)

Possibly.  Quite a few of the git trees are looking pretty fat.  I need to
get another kernel-status thingy out soon, but that takes many hours of
bugzilla-poking.
