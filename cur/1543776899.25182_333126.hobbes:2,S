How did you notice?  By code inspection or by runtime observation?  If the
latter, please share.

"offending" is a good description.  That code sucks.  But it sits on the
edge between two subsystems which really really want to take those locks in
opposite order.

Yeah.  But these _are_ spinlocks, so spinning is what's supposed to happen.
 Maybe we should dump that silly schedule() and just do cpu_relax(). 
Although I do recall once theorising that the time we spend in the
schedule() might be preventing livelocks.

Nope, yield() can cause terribly long delays when other tasks are cpu-bound.
