	That may be the heart of this discussion ... it is possible
we have different ideas of how the kernel/OS should act based on perceived
roles we see it playing.  In no way am I stating that one *always* wants
to prevent OOM, or kernel-based process killing policy.  I'm simply saying
it should be a configurable behavior.  As such, I feel it would allow Linux
to be useful in more roles.
	For example.  In a C2 security system, if something happens such
that auditing cannot continue, it is preferable that the system be shut down
(or suspended, or deadlocked).  Such behavior is very unlikely what *I* want
on my personal workstation or what most people want, but *some* people
want that behavior.  I would like to see the framework to allow a range
of behaviors to allow Linux to play a range of 'roles'.
	In the examples you gave of kernel memory usage:

	Does the kernel actually allocate all of these and just "not use 
them" -- i.e. are these really cases of where space is allocated and then goes
unused?  I'd think all of these are cases where the kernel was expecting to
actually use the memory and really doesn't want a non-physical allocation, but
a real, physical allocation.  Specifically I was thinking of calls that 
used overcommit -- meaning allocing space that they really didn't intend to
use, but you are right -- all of those cases would need to be handled as far
as memory allocation bookkeeping.  But we already do bookkeeping for 'free'
memory, 'used' memory, 'shared' memory -- would adding 'committed' or 'reserved'
memory really be that much more difficult or costly?
