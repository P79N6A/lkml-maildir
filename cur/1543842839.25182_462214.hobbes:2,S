I think he was asking if a non-admin user can create processes of less 
privilege without becoming root. The answer is yes, however, it is 
policy driven. Users will have numerous 'derived' types that are less 
privilege than, for example, their interactive shell. For example, 
user_irc_t or user_evolution_t. The transitions will happen when the 
user runs irc or evolution and those apps will be limited to the rights 
they require. These are fine grained though, and mandatory. These 
capabilities are so course grained I just can't see anyone ever using them.
