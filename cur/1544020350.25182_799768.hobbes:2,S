But I think the simplest method to pass requests to specified CPU is via
work queue (queue_work_on()). We can add a function named
cryptd_enqueue_request_on(), and construct a load-balance version cryptd
on top of that.

Well. At least we can just remove spin lock now, and if it is necessary
we can add that back without big effort.
