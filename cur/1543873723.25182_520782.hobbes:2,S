While you may have a few concurrent threads competing for the same
"offset" and "pid" in the loop - e.g. at point [1] (see below), only
one will succeed with "registering" it due to the atomicity of
test_and_set_bit() and so only this one will get at point [2] with the
"pid".
The rest of the "unlucky" threads will either
(i) compete for another "offset" -> "pid" (as described above);
(ii) leave the loop when one of the conditions of while() becomes
"false" -> e.g. there are no more free slots in this map.
                if (likely(atomic_read(&map->nr_free))) {
                        do {
                                // [1]
                                if (!test_and_set_bit(offset, map->page)) {
                                // [2]
                                        atomic_dec(&map->nr_free);
                                        pid_ns->last_pid = pid;
                                        return pid;
                                }
                                offset = find_next_offset(map, offset);
                                pid = mk_pid(pid_ns, map, offset);
                        /*
                         * find_next_offset() found a bit, the pid from it
                         * is in-bounds, and if we fell back to the last
                         * bitmap block and the final block was the same
                         * as the starting point, pid is before last_pid.
                         */
                        } while (offset < BITS_PER_PAGE && pid < pid_max &&
                                        (i != max_scan || pid < last ||
                                            !((last+1) & BITS_PER_PAGE_MASK)));
