	Specifically using your example of USB memories, I have seen devices move 
around just because of rebooting.  I have a Sandisk SDDR-31 (MMC) and a 
SDDR-33 (CF) that remain plugged into the same USB ports all the time.  
Occasionally, they come up swapped (normally the MMC reader is /dev/sda), 
which is really infuriating, since my scripts for building MMC and CF cards 
then exhibit much breakage.
	And whether it's something unique to this motherboard, those devices, or 
what, but I've seen any number of times the kernel/modules get into a state 
where the module cannot be unloaded because the in-use counter is set, yet 
nothing appears to be using it.  When it gets into this state, the device is 
unusable, and my only recourse is to reboot (just like Windows!)
	I haven't had an opportunity to further characterize the problem, but it's 
been persistent across 2.4 and 2.5 kernels.
