The arch/ppc64 stuff mostly looks OK - however I would prefer that you
created a new arch/ppc64/kernel/hvcs.c (and include/asm-ppc64/hvcs.h)
rather than tripling the size of the existing hvconsole.c.  There are
a couple of whitespace nits (missing space after "if" in a couple of
places), and this:
> +#define HVCS_LONG_INVALID	0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
would look better as either ~0UL or -1L (and I don't see why it really
needs a #define).
Regards,
Paul.
