So, im confused.. The reason for this is that the internal sensor is
operating on some sort of weird scale, and thus when you interpolate it
into "your" scale, it doesent quite come out in the actual degrees
celcius the cpu temperature really is?
so if i understand this correctly, the coretemp output does NOT
represent the actual deg celcius temperature my cpu is?
