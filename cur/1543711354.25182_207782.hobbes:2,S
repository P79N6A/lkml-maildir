The whole reiserfs patcheset from -suse is now at:
ftp.suse.com/pub/people/mason/patches/data-logging/experimental/2.6.4
The mm tree does already have the most important reiserfs latency fix,
which is named reiserfs-lock-lat.  Andrew sent along to linus as well,
so it should be in mainline.

patches above don't include that one yet (I'll upload it today).
