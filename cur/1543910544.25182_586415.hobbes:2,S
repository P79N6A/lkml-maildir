See the patch I sent earlier today?

The initial idea was to make each slab allocation respect the watermarks
like page allocation does (the page rank thingies, if you remember).
That is if the slab is allocated from below the ALLOC_MIN|ALLOC_HARDER
threshold, an ALLOC_MIN|ALLOC_HIGH allocation would get memory, but an
ALLOC_MIN would not.
Now, we only needed the ALLOC_MIN|ALLOC_HIGH|ALLOC_HARDER <->
ALLOC_NO_WATERMARKS transition and hence fell back to a binary system
that is not quite fair wrt to all the other levels but suffices for the
problem at hand.
So we want to ensure that slab allocations that are _not_ entitled to
ALLOC_NO_WATERMARK memory will not get objects when a page allocation
with the same right would fail, even if there is a slab present.

Trouble with something like that is that page flags are peristent and
you'd need to clean them when the status flips -> O(n) -> unwanted.

Yeah, I've seen earlier versions of those.
