Socks is not installed as part of the operating system.  There are a great many socks servers ported to Windows however.
Old Wingate versions (1.x and 2.0) defaulted to wide open access.  Recent Wingate versions (2.1+) default to binding services to
internal interfaces only to avoid this sort of thing.  Unbound services are turned off during the installation of an upgrade.  (the
3.0 release no longer has a free 2 machine license.)
www.wingate.com is run by Deerfield the US distributor.  Many (most?) problem reports taken by them never make it back to the
developer.
www.qbik.com is run by the developer Adrien de Croy (in New Zealand) who is very interested in reports of security flaws in the
current version.  I always received a response the next day with a confirmation or a work-around.
