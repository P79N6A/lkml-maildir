Using 2.4.4-ac3 (as well as in 2.4.3*) I have found it impossible to 
unmap a loopback
strace losetup -d /dev/loop0 (relevant portion)
open("/dev/loop0", O_RDONLY)            = 3
ioctl(3, LOOP_CLR_FD, 0)                = -1 EBUSY (Device or resource busy)
open("/usr/share/locale/en_US/LC_MESSAGES/libc.mo", O_RDONLY) = -1 
ENOENT (No such file or directory)
open("/usr/share/locale/en/LC_MESSAGES/libc.mo", O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT 
(No such file or directory)
write(2, "ioctl: LOOP_CLR_FD: Device or re"..., 44ioctl: LOOP_CLR_FD: 
Device or resource busy) = 44
_exit(1)                                = ?
also I have loop.o as module, and use count never decreases, in fact 
right now it is at 294.
