Deliberately, these aren't available outside of the scheduler so that
they can't be played with. Much as things like the symbol table aren't
exported to modules, some things in the kernel aren't even available
to other parts of the core kernel :-)

If you really need to play with this stuff, then why not just make
your own kernel tree with this hacked up in the scheduler code itself?
If it's just for you, then that'll work fine. If you would explain
what it is that you need to do, then someone might be able to offer
you advice on the general direction to take - see also
