Hello,
I'm using kernel 2.4.2 + raid/reiser patches (26. Feb) + zerocopy + loop6.
When trying to start my 4 SCSI-HD raid5/reiserfs array, I get the
following errors:

It seems that the mountcounter are different, but I allways mount/unmount
them together. Older kernels (2.4.2 with older reiser/raid patches (24.
Feb?), without zerocopy) worked fine. Is there a way to mount it again or
is this a bug in raid code?
Thanks and greetings
