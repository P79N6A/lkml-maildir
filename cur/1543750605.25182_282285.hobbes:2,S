I don't think you realize what the failure case for popf was.
It wasn't that we couldn't single-step it: it was that we corrupted the 
resulting elfags value after single-stepping it.
Try to extend your program to print out not only the EIP after the 
single-step, but also the value of EFLAGS, and you'll see what I mean. 
Earlier kernels are _really_ bad at it: they'll always report that TF is 
set. The "TF-careful" patch gets TF right for normal instructions, and the 
"TF-popf" patch gets TF right after popf too.
The one remaining case I know of where we still get TF wrong is "pushf",
where single-stepping a pushf will not corrupt TF, but it will save the
wrong value on the stack (which obviously may corrupt TF _later_, when the
paired "popf" happens).
It's sad that x86 put the single-stepping into a user-visible register.  
All the other debug state is kernel-only, meaning that we don't have to
play any games with them... It would have been nice if Intel had added a
"single-step" bit to %db7, and then just or'ed in the values of TF and the
new flag when deciding to single-step. That would have allowed the legacy
stuff to work, and given debuggers a much less intrusive way to single-
step.
