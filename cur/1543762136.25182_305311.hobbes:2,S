i think the 'migrate read-count' method is not adequate either, because
all callbacks queued within an RCU read section must be called after the
lock has been dropped - while with the migration method CPU#1 would be
free to process callbacks queued in the RCU read section still active on
CPU#2.
i'm wondering how much of a problem this is though. Can there be stale
pointers at that point? Yes in theory, because code like:
	rcu_read_lock();
	call_rcu(&dentry->d_rcu, d_callback);
	func(dentry->whatever);
	rcu_read_unlock();
would be unsafe because the pointer is still accessed within the RCU
read section, and if we get migrated from CPU#1 to CPU#2 after call_rcu
but before dentry->whatever dereference, the callback may be processed
early by CPU#1, making the dentry->whatever read operation unsafe.
the question is, does this occur in practice? Does existing RCU-using
code use pointers it has queued for freeing, relying on the fact that
the callback wont be processed until we drop the RCU read lock?
