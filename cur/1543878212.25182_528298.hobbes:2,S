The following benchmarks are from

 or,

|REISER4 gzip| 2295 | 213 |

Column one measures the time taken to complete the bonnie++ benchmarking
test (run with the parameters bonnie++ -n128:128k:0)
Column two, Disk Usage: measures the amount of disk used to store 655MB
of raw data (which was 3 different copies of the Linux kernel sources).

Damn, I did it again. WHY DO YOU CARE?
Look, its simple, I am (among other things) discussing these results, so
people need to see them.

Actually, to some extent, bonnie++ tests the reliability of the
filesystem, eg, NTFS-3g usually fails.
By the way, I have pulled the plug on my REISER4 system, a number of
times now, and it recovers without problem.

Bad blocks are NOT dealt with by the filesystem,... so your comment is
irrelevant, or just plain wrong.
If your filesystem is writing to bad blocks, then throw away your
operating system.

Wow, consider me totally impressed by your AMAZING BIAS.
Would you like to tell me why you are SO BIASED against REISER4.
