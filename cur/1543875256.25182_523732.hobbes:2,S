It needs to be fixed before 2.6.21 final nevertheless.

There is not much interesting to see in the log.
Can you please test the following:
Add "clocksource=acpi_pm" to the kernel commandline.
If this does not change anything, then disable CONFIG_HPET and retry.
One thing in the log is indeed scary:
[    2.959150] Calibrating delay using timer specific routine.. 20089.12
BogoMIPS (lpj=100445639)
This is after the reboot, but it is not related to your problem. This is
a different problem, which needs urgent attention.
Adrian, can you open a seperate entry for this please ? It is not a new
thing, this can be observed with older kernels as well, but it needs to
be addressed. It probably needs a similar solution as I did for the
local apic timer calibration.
