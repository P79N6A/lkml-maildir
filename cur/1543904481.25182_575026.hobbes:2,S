Exactly. In the 2.6.23-rc1 merge window, I am trying to submit blackfin
driver patches and other new stuffs. So put those bug fixing and some
small updates in this series.
I will review the series again, submit critical bug fixing in rc2 and
maybe split rest of them into following -rc.
Thanks Jeff, after using you script, I generate this big email. It's
beautiful but I missed merge window.
Thanks a lot
