Sorry, but this is backwards.
Let's say you have an interface on which you want to turn DAD off.
There are ways to do it:
1.  Turn DAD off on all interfaces usinc ipv6/conf/default and then
     turn it on just on the interface you want.
This solution is a royal pain and introduces a potential race
on the interfaces that should have DAD enabled (i.e. you address will
be preferred when it really should be tentative).
2.  Wait until the interface is up and then turn off dad.
However at this point, DAD may have completely already so turning it off
is useless to us.
There needs to be a mechanism by which protocol parameters may be 
changed on the interface bases before the interface is up/running.
This has been bugging me for while too.
