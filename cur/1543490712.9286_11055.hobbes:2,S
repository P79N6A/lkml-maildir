I've tinkered with HINT on some boxes here as well; we haven't tested
it on a box running 2.2.x, but we have on boxes running 2.0.35 and 36.
Your graphs for Linux look low compared to our results.  What net MQUIPS
did you get for double?  We observed net MQUIPS of 18.1 for double on a
single PII-400 running 2.0.35 (128 MB RAM).
We've got a good "three-step" curve of those results graphed online:

although the double results look a little crushed due to scaling effects
resulting from being on the same graph with the integer results.
