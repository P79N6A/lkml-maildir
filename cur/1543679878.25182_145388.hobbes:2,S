I disagree with the "dirtier" bit, but still. I'd rather have this sort
of stuff put into subarch, where most people don't have to look at it.
More to the point, the changes would be confined to the big-iron arches,
and have less chance of breaking anyone else for things they don't
care about, nor do them any benefit. Touching this code is fragile as
hell, so if it can be confined, it should be ...
It'd also remove the long-standing abuse of phys_cpu_present_map, which
would probably make the rest of the code clearer.
