Not at all. During our prior discussions on the topic we have concluded
that resource management (CKRM\b\b\b\bResource Groups, UBC) and resource
isolation (cpuset) are totally orthogonal and have their own values from
the customer point of view. I still stand by that :).

Yes, we do. That implementation is deemed complex, intrusive and it also
increases maintenance burden. So, the object here (in this thread) is to
get a simple memory controller that does resource management (not
resource isolation).
