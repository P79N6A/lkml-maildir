This doesn't seem like the best solution to me. If free_irq and 
request_irq fix anything, then that indicates that the ohci1394 device 
is generating interrupts at some point during resume, which is likely 
not a good thing. If the device doesn't have a shared interrupt, then 
freeing the IRQ line will disable the IRQ line and prevent the interrupt 
storm, but if the ohci1394 device shared an interrupt with something 
else then the interrupt storm would still occur.
Likely the driver should be setting some register on the device to 
disable it from generating interrupts before suspend and it's not doing 
this.
