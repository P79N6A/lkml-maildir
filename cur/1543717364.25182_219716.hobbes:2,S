Yes, 2.14 from the Tyan site, released a a few weeks ago.

The box is all IDE; the above messages are from the 3ware controller,
which emulates a SCSI device.
There is nothing hanging on the on-board Adaptec SCSI controller.
The BIOS doesn't provide a setting to disable it, though I think
there is a jumper on the motherboard.
Unfortunately, I have to slap this box into production later today,
so I can't experiment much more.  But we have a half-dozen of these
motherboards in the office running Solaris 8 or FC1, and those are
slated for eventual upgrade to a 2.6 kernel, so I'll try to take one
out of production for a bit of experimentation.
Thanks.
