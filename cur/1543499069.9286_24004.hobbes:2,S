Subject: proc entry for actual kernel filename

I tend to keep several builds of the same kernel version in /boot.  I
name them with a suffix to keep them straight example: linux-2.2.9mb5,
linux-2.2.9mb6, linux-2.2.9mb7, etc.  Each suffix is actually the
build number from /usr/src/linux/.version with my initials.
Occasionally I'll have names like linux-2.2.9ac3mb2 when using Alan's
patches.
I enter these names directly into lilo.conf image=  with a simple
label= to boot them.  It's a simple system, but it works and lets me
keep them fairly organized.  I've written scripts which do almost
everything from building and copying the kernels to /boot with the
proper names, copying each one's .config with a proper name to an
archive directory, etc.
What I attempted to do now was modify my rc.sysinit to link the proper
System.map (which all have similar names System.map-2.2.9mb5, etc.) to
/boot/System.map based on which kernel I booted.  But I've come to a
brick wall that I can't seem to figure a way around.  I can get the
kernel version from several places, but nowhere can I find the actual
kernel filename that was booted.  Several entries in /proc give the
version that I can parse.  Has anyone ever thought of creating a /proc
entry with the actual filename?  Perhaps it's a more difficult task
than I imagine or maybe I just missed it already available somewhere.
Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks!
Mike
