Hi David,
I have a Matrox Millenium G200 AGP card. When I use scrollback while the
logo is displayed, random garbage gets inserted into lines that are on
lower half of the screen.
This problem also occurs when I'm using 'less' or 'more' to look at some
text file. Whenever I scroll, the first few lines where the logo has been
displayed are not updated.
As someone else noted, the problem goes away if you change the console
and change back to the first. (Alt-F1 -> Alt-F2 -> Alt-F1).
Anyway, I think that it's good to make the logo a config option. I did
not remove any code, I just want to let people choose.
cheers,
Patrick

PPS: I would like to clean the fbcon code. Would that be accepted ?
