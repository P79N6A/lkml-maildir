Please file a bug in bugzilla.kernel.org, include kernel version, lspci
-vvxx, dmesg and as much info as you can get when it hangs (it may help
to try cdrecord on the command line here and see if that also hangs as if
you are not in X you'll get any kernel panic messages needed to debug it).
Also if you have time to roll your own kernel with all the kernel debug
options on (especially lock debugging) and do the same as the above that
may also produce interesting traces.
