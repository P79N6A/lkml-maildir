Cool.
Just remove the third part altogether.  The "hash" is only 32 bits
anyway (even on 64-bit platforms, as we don't want to blow up the dentry
size unnecessarily).  And with most machines with reasonable memory, you
already get fine distribution with just two terms (ie you don't lose any
bits), and it speeds it up and avoids the problem you see.
Thanks..
