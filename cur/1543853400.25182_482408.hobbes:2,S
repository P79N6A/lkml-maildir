Subject: [PATCH] aic94xx: delete ascb timers when freeing queues
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/11/14/335

When the aic94xx driver creates ascbs, each ascb is initialized with a
timeout timer.  If there are any ascbs left over when the driver is being
torn down, these timers need to be deleted.  In particular, we seem to
hit this case when ascbs are issued yet never end up on the done list.
Right now there's a sequencer bug that results in this happening every
so often.
CONTROL PHY commands are typically sent when things are really messed
up with the sequencer; however, any other leftover ascb should produce
loud warnings.
