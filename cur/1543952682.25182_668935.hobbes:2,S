Right, above checking is based on a very simple policy "creator of a
resource is also the owner in term of releasing it" and will not cover
other customized patterns. We had a case - believe on sles9, in which
a child process manipulated/released resources from parent one, and
it was not easy to find the bug.
Wrt/ your actual question: we can remove the tgid stuff from ehca kernel
code. When do you expect me to send a patch at latest?
