Yeah.  Back when I did the BK snapshots, I would occasionally do a 
middle-of-the-day snapshot if there were a ton of incoming merges in a 
24-hour span.
If this "huge -git1" becomes a real problem, we could always
* give you a manual "do snapshot" button
* ask the maintainers to spread out their submits across multiple days, 
as I am doing now
* sell you on capping the daily push-to-kernel.org limit.  merge stuff 
into "day1", "day2", etc. branches when the main branch "fills up" for 
the day.
None of these are terribly painful, but none are terribly appealing either.
