Aamir,
I think all packets are queued to the network device from the protocol
stack in
--------
int dev_queue_xmit(struct sk_buff *skb) 
in 
net/core/dev.c

(I assume you use IP).
I would also encourage you to look at Linux network QOS implementations.
You might be able to do what you want to do without modifying  
the kernel.
There is a excellant web page which describes this at
http://qos.ittc.ukans.edu/
Hope this helps
