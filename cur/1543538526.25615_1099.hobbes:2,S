This was answered on this list, as well as in svgalib faq on
www.svgalib.org, and is answered in documentation of latest svgalib:
Svgalib background execution support depended on being able to mmap
/self/proc/mem, which is notpossible since linux-2.3.27. The solution is
to compile svgalib without background support. To do that get source
distribution of svgalib, edit Makefile.cfg to comment out the line
BACKGROUD = Y, and then recompile and reinstall svgalib.
