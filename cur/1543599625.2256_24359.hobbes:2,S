And why should the compiler warn at all? The range of "int" completely 
covers the range of "unsigned char", so the result of the comparison will 
always be correct if the types were chosen correctly.
... unless of course the programmer used an unsigned char when what he 
really wanted was a signed char. But in that case even your typed min 
macro won't save him, because what should the forced type be anyway? If 
it's "int", nothing changes; if it's "signed char", you risk truncating 
the int. So you end up with something like
	min(int, a, (char)b)
and I fail to see how this is any better than
	min(a, (char)b)
