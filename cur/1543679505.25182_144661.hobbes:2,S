Hi,
I'm having trouble with my cd-writer :
/dev/hdd:
  Model=Hewlett-Packard CD-Writer Plus 7500, FwRev=1.0a, SerialNo=YMT3WLUJLS
  Config={ Fixed Removeable DTR<=5Mbs DTR>10Mbs nonMagnetic }
  RawCHS=0/0/0, TrkSize=0, SectSize=0, ECCbytes=0
  BuffType=unknown, BuffSize=0kB, MaxMultSect=0
  (maybe): CurCHS=0/0/0, CurSects=0, LBA=yes, LBAsects=0
  IORDY=on/off, tPIO={min:180,w/IORDY:120}, tDMA={min:120,rec:120}
  PIO modes:  pio0 pio1 pio2 pio3 pio4
  DMA modes:  sdma0 sdma1 sdma2 mdma0 mdma1 *mdma2
  AdvancedPM=no
It is recognized with linux 2.4.18, and isnt with 2.4.21. My box freeze 
at its detection.
I've tried ide-scsi, which complains about a timeout, and freeze too.
I'm currently locked to linux 2.4.18, and thats a problem for me 
(pthreads bug, etc..).
Does someone have a tip, an idea, or something ?
Thanks.
