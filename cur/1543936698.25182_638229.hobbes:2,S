Al,
I admit I haven't read everything of the discussion.  So, sorry if I got
on your nerves.  (However, 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/5/151
 and
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/5/209
 didn't yield responses which addressed
the mentioned points.  Also, "libata's reasons for doing so apply to
usb-storage as well" is not a fact-based answer to these points either.
Anyway, sorry if I missed an according response elsewhere.)

I'm relieved.  :-)
