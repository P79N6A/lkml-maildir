I wonder if it would be better to use CODA, or similar shared FS, as 
opposed to NFS in this situation.  I don't have any strong knowledge of 
NFS standards, but I wonder if a nfssync() would be possible, and still
be compliant with the standards out there.  It wound't seem useful if it
only worked on Linux boxen.
