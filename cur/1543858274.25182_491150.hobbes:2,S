Hello,
 In the course of adding support for the TURBOchannel bus to the tgafb 
driver I discovered and fixed a few problems and did a few cleanups.  
They form this series of patches.  I have tested them all successfully on 
an 8-plane and a 32-plane board, but they are both TURBOchannel options 
(ZLX-E1 and ZLX-E3, respectively).  I do not have any PCI TGA cards, so 
please anybody who cares about them and have suitable hardware do a little 
bit of testing.
