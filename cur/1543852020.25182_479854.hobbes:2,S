Yes. That isync is to prevent loads to be speculated accross spin_lock,
thus leaking out of the lock by the top. In fact, it doesn't act on the
load per-se but it prevent speculative execution accross the conditional
branch in the spin_lock.

Yes.
What isync provides is
a = *foo
spin_lock_loop_with_conditional_branch
isync
b = *bar
It prevents the read of b from being speculated by the CPU ahead of a
