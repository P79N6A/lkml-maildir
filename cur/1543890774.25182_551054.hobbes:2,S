This is true .. However, if there is a speed different it's small.
In the past I've replace sched_clock() with a clocksource, and there was
no noticeable speed different .. Just recently I replaced x86's
sched_clock() math with the clocksource math with no noticable
difference .. At least not from my benchmarks ..

There is room, but we don't need sched_clock() .. Certainly we shouldn't
force architectures to implement sched_clock() by calling it a "bug" if
it's lowres.
