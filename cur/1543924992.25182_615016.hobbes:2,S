Subject: [PATCH] Fix isspace() and other ctype.h functions to ignore chars 128-255
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Originally isspace() and other similar functions in ctype.h ignored  
any character with the high bit set; however this was changed during  
the linux 2.1 days to map Latin-1.  As following Latin-1 will most  
likely break UTF-8 any any *other* encoding that is backwards- 
compatible with 7-bit-ASCII, change ctype.c to ignore such characters  
completely (the way they were before).  Linus seems to think this is  
a good thing, and he's the one that wrote the code in the first place.
