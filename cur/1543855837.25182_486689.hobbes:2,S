Subject: just how "sanitized" are the sanitized headers?

  i noticed that, when i generate the sanitized headers with "make
headers_install", there are still a number of headers files that are
installed with variations on "#ifdef __KERNEL__".
  i always thought the fundamental property of sanitized headers was
to be compatible with glibc and have no traces of "KERNEL" content
left.  so what's the purpose of leaving some header files with that
preprocessor content?  thanks.
