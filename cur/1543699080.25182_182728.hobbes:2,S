This is a tight squeeze.  The system has 13 PCI interrupt inputs, but
the chip-set has only a single IO-APIC with 8-pins to handle them.
You don't see all the interrupts in /proc/interrupts because there are
not device drivers attached to all of them -- but if you edit them in
from lspci output you'd get this:
  0:   40022145    IO-APIC-edge  timer
  1:      62950    IO-APIC-edge  i8042
  2:          0          XT-PIC  cascade
  8:     681626    IO-APIC-edge  rtc
  9:          0   IO-APIC-level  acpi
 12:         55    IO-APIC-edge  i8042
 14:     968274    IO-APIC-edge  ide0
 15:    1789182    IO-APIC-edge  ide1
 16:     404489   IO-APIC-level  EMU10K1, eth2
 17:                             eth3
 18:     445160   IO-APIC-level  ide2, ide3, eth0
 19:    1596427   IO-APIC-level  eth1, matrox
 20:          0   IO-APIC-level  ohci_hcd
 21:          0   IO-APIC-level  NVidia nForce2 audio, usb
 22:      36730   IO-APIC-level  ohci_hcd, audio
 23:                             smbus
No, the siimage appears to be a single pci device, so you'll not get to
split ide2 and ide3.
The ethernets appears to be a quad DEC ethernet card with a PCI bridge. 
You're using eth0 and eth1.  But if you used eth3 instead of eth0, you'd
have an ethernet I/F with an interrupt all to itself.
cheers,

ps. yes, the AML shows these interrupt links are programmable, but it is
unclear if the BIOS/hardware is capable of programming any of the PCI
interrupts to unused destinations < 16 when in APIC mode.
I'd be interested to see the dmesg -s40000 for this box.
