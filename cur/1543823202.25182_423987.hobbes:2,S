argh.
If we didn't do this lazy-ass put-the-declaration-in-the-C-file thing, we'd
have noticed that the declaration of use_cyclone is in
include/asm-i386/mach-summit/mach_mpparse.h.
use_cyclone isn't defined if !CONFIG_X86_CYCLONE_TIMER.
arch/i386/kernel/srat.c is only compiled if X86_SUMMIT || X86_GENERICARCH.
<tries to break it>
I have a config here which has NUMA=y, ACPI_SRAT=y, X86_SUMMIT=n (and
X86_SUMMIT_NUMA=y!!) and, for some reason it set X86_CYCLONE_TIMER=y, which
is dumb.  But it will manage to link with this patch applied.
But still, referencing a variable which is implemented in
arch/i386/kernel/timers/timer_cyclone.c from within arch/i386/kernel/srat.c
is asking for trouble, no?
