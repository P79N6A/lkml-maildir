I hope you don't mind if I continue this thread 5 months later...I put
this issue in my TODO list and now I really need to fix it.
Your advice seems fine, but it brings some restrictions on flash
concatenations: for example, if I have 2 flashes of 32Mbytes, I need
to create 2 partitions whose sizes are 32M - 64K bytes but then I
can't concatenate these two partitions anymore since concatenation
works with mtd devices, not partitions, does it ?
It seems easier to simply probe the flash, then check for its size and
eventually restrict the end of it if needed:
        *mtd = do_map_probe("xxx_probe", map);
        while (mtd->size > 32Mb - 64Kb)
                (*mtd)->size -= (*mtd)->erasesize;
But I don't know if the MTD layer allows this kind of operation, do you ?
Thanks
