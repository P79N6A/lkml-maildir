FWIW I changed all arch's, but most (except ppc) got changed back.  At 
the time we had data showing the more aggressive wake idle and newidle 
was good for things like OLTP.
Brian, do you have cpu util numbers and runqueue lengths for both tests?

Brian, I am not sure if you were thinking of a particular set of sched 
changes, but I suspect it might be one or more in the list below (my 
guess is the first and last).  Would it be possible to back out these 
change-sets from 2.6.13-rc5 and see if there is any difference?  FWIW, 
even if they do help, I am not suggesting, yet, that they should be 
reverted.  I am hoping there is some compromise that can work better in 
all situations.

    [PATCH] sched: no aggressive idle balancing
    Remove the very aggressive idle stuff that has recently gone into 2.6 - it is
    going against the direction we are trying to go.  Hopefully we can regain
    performance through other methods.

    [PATCH] sched: tweak affine wakeups
    Do less affine wakeups.  We're trying to reduce dbt2-pgsql idle time
    regressions here...  make sure we don't don't move tasks the wrong way in an
    imbalance condition.  Also, remove the cache coldness requirement from the
    calculation - this seems to induce sharp cutoff points where behaviour will
    suddenly change on some workloads if the load creeps slightly over or under
    some point.  It is good for periodic balancing because in that case have
    otherwise have no other context to determine what task to move.
    But also make a minor tweak to "wake balancing" - the imbalance tolerance is
    now set at half the domain's imbalance, so we get the opportunity to do wake
    balancing before the more random periodic rebalancing gets preformed.

    [PATCH] sched: balance timers
    Do CPU load averaging over a number of different intervals.  Allow each
    interval to be chosen by sending a parameter to source_load and target_load.
    0 is instantaneous, idx > 0 returns a decaying average with the most recent
    sample weighted at 2^(idx-1).  To a maximum of 3 (could be easily increased).
    
    So generally a higher number will result in more conservative balancing.

    [PATCH] sched: less aggressive idle balancing
    
    Remove the special casing for idle CPU balancing.  Things like this are
    hurting for example on SMT, where are single sibling being idle doesn't really
    warrant a really aggressive pull over the NUMA domain, for example.
