I have a Thinkpad with a buggy pentium (see cat /proc/cpuinfo below) and 
I tried running the F00F test program available from 
http://lwn.net/2001/0329/a/ltp-f00f.php3
 first on a 2.2.17 kernel that 
I've been running for ages without problems I got this output:
Testing for proper f00f instruction handling.
SIGILL received from f00f instruction.  Good.
Then I tried 2.4.4 with your patch applied and got the same output (and 
no lockup), so according to that test program your patch does not break 
the F00F handling code. :-)
If you want me to test other patches, just let me know and I'll be happy 
to do so!
