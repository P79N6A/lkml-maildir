For a while now I've been running a 1000Hz 2.4 O(1) kernel tree that uses 
timeslice granularity set to MIN_TIMESLICE which has stark smoothness 
improvements in X. I've avoided promoting this idea because of the 
theoretical drop in throughput this might cause. I've not been able to see 
any detriment in my basic testing of this small granularity, so I was curious 
to see what you throught was a reasonable lower limit?
