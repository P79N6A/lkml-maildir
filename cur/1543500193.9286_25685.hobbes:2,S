Could you give a try also to:
	
ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/people/andrea/kernel-patches/2.2.10_andrea-VM9.gz
This one is against 2.2.10 and it's a "stable" release. You may consider
it the equivalent of 2.3.7_andrea1, but against 2.2.10 and really stable.

The difference are not so high in the bonnie numbers though. Also bonnie
runs over a filesystem so a different layout on disk may change the
profile. Probably bonnie is not an optimal test (at least with normal HD)
since the I/O bandwith seems just pretty much handled. It's interesting
that the >2.3.7 has a less CPU power involved in the operations and that
in turn means that we'll be able to handle higher I/O bandwith with faster
HD.
I think the interesting difference is shown from the make dep test. Also
the make bzImage would probably show interesting differences but you
should only look at the system time and ignore the user-time otherwise the
difference will be hided from gcc.
