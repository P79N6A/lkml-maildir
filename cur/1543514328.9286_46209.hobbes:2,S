Hi

Yours is the code I've understood most, but all of them have been
about writing data across the port, but I need to be able to control
the individual data lines, e.g. I need to specifically take D0 and the
PAPER OUT lines high for a period of time, then drop them low.
Is this kind of stuff possible?
Cheers,
