Hey guys,
I know there are a couple walkthroughs for upgrading
from 2.4.xx on RH9 to 2.6-testx on the web, for instance:
http://thomer.com/linux/migrate-to-2.6.html
http://www.fearthecow.net/kernel.html
http://kerneltrap.org/node/view/799
However these seem incomplete, and the Kernel How-To
seems to lack any mention of 2.5 nevermind 2.6.
I'll gladly write a comeplete update guide for
testers, but I need to know the full info.
I noticed Arjan van de Ven (sweet name ;-) put some
2.6-test4 RPMS up at 
http://people.redhat.com/arjanv/2.5/RPMS.kernel/
but they are from Aug 25, and I know some bugfixes have
gone into BK since then, are there any more up2date
rpms around for RH9?  Also Arjan, is there a
module-init-tools rpm lying around?
Where are the latest nVidia driver patches found?
I think that covers my broad range of broad questions.
