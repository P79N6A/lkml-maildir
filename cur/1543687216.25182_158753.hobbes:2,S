Only if you are on a shared lan.  If you are not on a shared lan, then
it will *ONLY* work if linux is on the other end.  No other system will
work.  And, you don't need an alias on loopback.  Merely changing the
default route will result in this.  Change default route from gw 1.1.1.1
on eth0 to gw 2.2.2.2 on eth1 (making sure that 2.2.2.2 doesn't have an
arp entry), and linux will say, on eth1:
whohas 2.2.2.2 tell 1.1.1.2
where 1.1.1.2 is the address on eth0.  No one will respond to this, so
all communication from beyond a directly connected network will now
fail.
