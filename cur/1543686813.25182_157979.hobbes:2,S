I'm still trying to get 2.4.21 to work on the new hardware before tackling 
2.5.  I think I've written off APM as a lost cause for the moment, though.  I 
need to catch up on some real work for a bit, but I'll probably see if 2.5 is 
also horked on monday.
My problem is that although the drive spins down, the cpu fan goes off, and 
the monitor goes black, the little "I am sleeping" moon shaped light never 
lights up.  (And the "I am running off of battery" light never goes off.)
Once it's in this state, there's no way to get the sucker to wake up.  I've 
pressed every key, and fn-every key, and the power button (repeatedly), and 
the special function keys, and the "thinkpad" key (whatever that's for...)
If I hold the power button for ten seconds, the thing will fully power down, 
so that if I press it again it'll reboot from a cold start.  I suppose this 
is an improvement over popping the battery to get it out of "brick" mode...

If I could get it to resume at all, life would be good.

Not for me.  Still fiddling...
