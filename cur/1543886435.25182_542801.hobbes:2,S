Subject: [patch 00/15] s390 patches for 2.6.22
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

A few fixes, some compiler warnings and the Kconfig cleanup.
s390 now uses the common drivers/Kconfig file instead of the
home-brewn drivers/s390/Kconfig. There are some more config
options for s390 now, not all of them make sense but as long
as the code compiles no harm is done.
