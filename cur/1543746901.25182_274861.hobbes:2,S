Hi Jeff,
I have also an SD- (and some other) card reader in my notebook.
These are working as standard usb-storage devices.
So you just do
# modprobe usb-storage
# mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/sd-card
(replace /dev/sda1 with your appropriate device and /mnt/sd-card with an 
existing mountpoint).
Greets,
Manuel
