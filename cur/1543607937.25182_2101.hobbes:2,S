Do you want to include an NTP daemon in the kernel? The timestamp
you suggested is taken way before any user mode daemon starts. Sure,
you can do the timestamp in userspace if you do not mind to lose a few
minutes precision (or whatever time the NTP daemon needs to
synchronize), but then we could just get rid of /proc/uptime and
claim that the whole thing is an userspace issue.
And what about my home machine if I do not want to dial in to my ISP right
after boot? You say that uptime should not be calculated if there are no
NTP servers reachable?
