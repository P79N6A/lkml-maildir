who, me?  umm...
I can see that a patch like this would have a place in a general
security-hardened kernel: one which closes off all the means by which root
can alter the running kernel.
But that's a specialised thing which interested parties can maintain as a
standalone patch, and bringing just one part of it into the main kernel
seems rather arbitrary.
