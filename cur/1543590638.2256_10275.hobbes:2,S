Are you referring to Neil Brown's nfs operations patch as being as ugly as
hell, or something else?  Just want to understand what you are saying before
arguing.....
NFS is ugly as hell, and we just try to conform to whatever is the latest trend
expected to be accepted since I really don't care so long as it works and
doesn't uglify ReiserFS more than necessary.  If you have another approach, one
that is less ugly, please let us know.  This is the first I have heard someone
complain, I thought his patch was liked by Linus architecturally and that it
would be going in sometime real soon now (which is why we coded for it).  Can
you articulate why you dislike it in more detail?
