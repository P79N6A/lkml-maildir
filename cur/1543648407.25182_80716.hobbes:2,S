The poll()-like code :
int my_io(...) {
	if (poll(...))
		do_io(...);
}
The epoll-like code :
int my_io(...) {
	while (do_io(...) == EAGAIN)
		event_wait(...);
}
I would say that the epoll-like code generates less system calls because
if you call my_io() by processing small chunks of the I/O space, the
epoll-like code will generate only one system call while the poll()-like
code two. In case of I/O that ends up in wait the poll()-like code
generate two system calls while epoll-like code three. Globally the number
of system calls are about the same and from a performance point of view
/dev/epoll looks "pretty good" ( see /dev/epoll page ).
