sending two sync req is quite slower than 1 sync req even with the disk,
infact in my experience the biggest issue with fast storage isn't the
seeking but the need of sending big requests down to the hardware.
Infact I think it's a _much_ bigger issue for disk than for nfs. Can you
benchmark it on a IDE with 128k long files? They should be read with a
single command, two commands are going to hurt.

looks ok to me. I guess this could be an historic paranoid/(possibly
needed in the past) thing, to avoid reading partial pages from there,
but the pagecache layer is robust enough to handle it these days.
Thanks.
