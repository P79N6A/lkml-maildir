It is just a file contains the text of the Oops message, any file.
Where is the_oops.txt?
----------------------
Normally the Oops text is read from the kernel buffers by klogd and
handed to syslogd which writes it to a syslog file, typically
/var/log/messages (depends on /etc/syslog.conf).  Sometimes klogd dies,
in which case you can run dmesg > file to read the data from the kernel 
buffers and save it.  Or you can cat /proc/kmsg > file, however you
have to break in to stop the transfer, kmsg is a "never ending file".
If the machine has crashed so badly that you cannot enter commands then
you have three options :-
(1) Hand copy the text from the screen and type it in after the machine
    has restarted.  Messy but it is the only option if you have not
    planned for a crash.
(2) Boot with a serial console (see Documentation/serial-console.txt),
    run a null modem to a second machine and capture the output there
    using your favourite communication program.  Minicom works well.
(3) Patch the kernel with one of the crash dump patches.  These save
    data to a floppy disk or video rom or a swap partition.  None of
    these are standard kernel patches so you have to find and apply
    them yourself.  Search kernel archives for kmsgdump, lkcd and
    oops+smram.
