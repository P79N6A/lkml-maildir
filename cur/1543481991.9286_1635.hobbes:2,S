Yes -- once.
I'm not sure exactly what version (I can look back) but something
recent (ie. 2.1.13x or later).
I was stress-testing the machine with a 'make -j' and seeing how bad
it would swap to test the effectiveness of some vm changes...
After I go lots of fork failures I control-c'd and stopped the build,
then a few minutes later after things had gone quiet, I did a make
clean and tried to rebuild -- only it failed!
When I checked it out, some header files had gone away. I suspected
disk corruption but e2fsck found nothing. So far, I'm lost as to why
this occurred... completely lost. My best guess so far (kernel errors
aside) is that make or some user-land utilities is doing bad things
when memory allocation fails...
If I could repeat this behavior is might be possible to track this.

OK, I reported this:

If it matters...
