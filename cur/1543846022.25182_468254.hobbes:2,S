Dear Dmitry:
A user filed a bug here which seems to indicate that hid lacks needed
exclusions for Apple pointers:
 
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=208721
Do you think we should be adding QUIRK_IGNORE for these?
Perhaps conditional on CONFIG_USB_APPLETOUCH?
We used to have those IGNORE quirks for Wacom, but then started to ignore
all Wacoms. We seem to be not at that point with Apple yet, and also they
have varying vendor IDs.
Cheers,
-- Pete
