I guess it has overwrite the files in /usr/src/linux which is the link to
your linux-2.2.5. this is why you did not see any new file/dir created.

but the files in /usr/src/linux has probably being overwritten by files
from 2.4.0.
you should always remove the link /usr/src/linux before you untar the
kernel under /use/src or untar it in some other directory and rename it
and then move it under /usr/src.
