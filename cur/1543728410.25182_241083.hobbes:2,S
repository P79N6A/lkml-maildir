The inline spinlocks are _wonderful_ for seeing where the contention is in 
a simple profile.
In contrast, in a profile the out-of-lines ones will show "x% was spent on 
spinlocks". Which doesn't help much when you want to see where the problem 
is.
This was _hugely_ useful, at least for me, for seeing what locks were 
problematic.
