If your APM BIOS doesn't spin down the disks when entering standby/suspend,
your APM BIOS implementation is broken (or if its a desktop machine, maybe
you didn't configure the APM BIOS settings correctly?)
You might try: hdparm -S 12 /dev/hda && apm -s; hdparm -S 0 /dev/hda
This should put a 1 minute inactivity timeout on the drive, then suspend
the machine.  1 minute later, the drive should spin down.  When you resume,
the following hdparm will turn off the inactivity timeout.

No coding required.  No extra commands required with a non-broken APM bios.
