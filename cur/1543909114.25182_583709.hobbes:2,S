But, this flag is used in many "strange" places like e.g. autoprobe,
so, on any problems with this, we have to check them all...

I've thought e.g. about "fasteoi" for this "Virtual Wire" timer for
i386: I hope it's OK, but since is it any problem to add some comment
here, why it's OK with resending here (with POWERPC it's easier to
think it's something special, but here we have to similar things in
the same file)?

Maybe no reason to risk, too.

Of course, I think you are right with this, but:
- this patch was active for quite a long time and, if it was so wrong
there was astonishingly small number of similar problems;
- there where many changes in drivers done around similar problems,
so how can you guarantee, they will behave resonably after such serious
change again;
- this new way with levels is different from 2.6.21/22 and 2.6.20 too;
it was tested only on 2 x86_64 boxes mainly for network; it's really
not much considering the number of various quirks.

So, we can only be sure boxes similar to Marcin's are safe now...

See my argument above... This is not 100% guarantee, and I think,
there is no reason to endanger even a small number of users/admins
for stresses like this, done to Marcin or Jean-Baptiste, when it's
possible to do this safer without much changes.
As a matter of fact I think about still another possibility, which
wasn't tested at all: let's say there is this "new" (retriggered)
interrupt possible instantly after enable_irq in a place, which
earlier wasn't affected with this. So, e.g. network _xmit or
_timeout code for some drivers can be interrupted in a place which
was always "wrong" for this, but for some reasons, not very probable
to hit (before this resending patch). Then, maybe it's all wrong
only because this level resending works OK here, but uncovers weak,
not irq-safe  places? In such a case skipping resend and software
resend should be OK: sw resend could be blocked here by softirqs off.
Of course, this can be false idea as well, but since it wasn't checked
yet (plus maybe several other possibilities) - we should be rather
cautious here.
