I don't see any such warning in the 2.6.13 sparc build at Jan's 
crosscompile page [1], and all my patch does is to turn a warning into 
an error.
If a #define is using it before the header with the prototype get's 
#include'd that's no problem as long as the prototype is available when 
the #define is _used_.
I'm not saying that there aren't cases this patch will break (and my 
patch shouldn't go into 2.6.14), but your example doesn't seem to cause 
problems.
