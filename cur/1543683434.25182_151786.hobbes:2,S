Couple of points/questions:
- Is it possible to make swsusp use a dedicated hibernate partition, for 
better interoperability with Windows? I was thinking of the dual boot 
situation, where I would like a laptop to boot whatever OS was booted 
last. And how does s4bios fit in?
- Perhaps we can mention in the help text that swsusp performs a 
function similar to hibernate, and different from the APM suspend 
operation, with corresponding power savings.
Thanks,
Rahul
