Subject: [PATCH 0/2] UML - Console fixes and cleanups for 2.6.24
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/8/3/201

These two patches fix the console write error that Miklos reported and
tidy up the code while I was in there.
They should hold off for 2.6.24 - the code with the bug that's being
fixed is also being held for 2.6.24.
