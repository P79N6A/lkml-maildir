This might be a little more complicated. These
are funnelled through the block/SCSI layers which might not have separate
unlocked ioctl callbacks yet. Would be probably not very difficult
to add though.

Just sending the patch to add lock/unlock_kernel() is probably a good idea anyways --
Jeff will then feel bad over it and eventually remove it when he figures out
it is safe ;-)
