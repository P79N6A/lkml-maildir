That's not what I meant.
Creating a 3 drive raid5 with 2 working drives and one 'missing' drive
is fine.
Creating a 3 drive raid5 with one good drive, one faulty drive and one
missing drive is unfortunate.  But the doing anything with a faulty
drive is unfortunate.

You added hdk1 as a spare.  md noticed that the array was degraded and
a spare was available so it started recovery of the missing drive on
to the spare.  It remains as a 'spare' until recovery is complete.
Then it becomes a full member.
However recovery didn't complete due to a read error on hde.  So hdk1
is still a spare.
Then you removed and re-added hde1, so it was a spare too.  md didn't
try to reconstruct onto either spare as it didn't have enough working
drives to perform a reconstruction.

This is no sense in which an array is marked faulty.  There is no
place to put the marking.
If you write to md2, it will fail.
If you read from md2, it might succeed or it might not, depending on
whether the data you try to read is stored on the working device or on
a failed device.

However md hasn't completely the recovery onto hdk1, so there is
nothing that can be done.

Linux won't detect anything.  But if you create the array in the same
way that you did before, with md1 and hde1, the data will still be
where it was.  And when you then read from the new md2, you will get
the data that was there before hde1 failed (as long as you don't read
from the block on hde1 that is faulty).
Good luck.
