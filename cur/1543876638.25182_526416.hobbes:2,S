The actual PCI bus could paravirtualized.  It's just a question of 
whether one reinvents a device discovery mechanism (like XenBus) or 
whether one piggy backs on existing mechanisms.
Furthermore, in the future, I strongly suspect that HVM will become much 
more important for Xen than PV and since that already has a PCI bus it's 
not really that big of a deal.
