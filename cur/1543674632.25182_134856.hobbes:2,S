The "$machine with broken BIOS detected, refusing to enable the local APIC"
message only affects the local APIC and the few services using it like the
NMI watchdog and some performance measurement/profiling tools.
It has no impact on whether APM works or not.
Possibly Mandrake 9.1 detects ACPI (not APIC) which would disable APM.
Try booting with "noacpi" or "acpi=off" or whatever the option is called.
