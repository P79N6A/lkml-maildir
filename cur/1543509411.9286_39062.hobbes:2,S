Dear Alan,
thank you for your great work (needed to be said!)
The most important part of this message is the patch.
2.3.18ac3 is far nearer to successful compilation than Linus' kernel but
it still has some issues:
- if you enable PCMCIA for module, compilation will not succeed (part of
it patched below)
    another issue is the missing pcmcia.o (which should be empty) which
is needed for zImage
- if I enable APM the machine crashes at partition checking (at least
since 2.3.14) (I think this is an often reported problem)
- 8390.o will not be build if you enable CONFIG_PCMCIA_PCNET (? DE-650
driver), also patch included
- vga16fb reported some problems registering vga memory. This might be a
cause of recent resource management changes, this might be a cause of
another clgenfb selected as a module (vga16 was compiled into the
kernel)
- there seems to be some issues with PCMCIA module loading once you got
it compile (log lost)
after I tried 'modprobe pcmcia_core' (perhaps a nono) the system kind of
locked up (not too solid ... a 'ps ax' gave out of memory, SysReq-U
didn't work, SysReq-B did.) I'll give it another try later.
Regards
     Christof
