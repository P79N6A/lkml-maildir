I didn't see the first two print, but I'm having to watch the bad
bootups (with NOAPIC) by eyesight alone, as I don't have a second system
to run netconsole on at the moment.
However, on the NOAPIC, locking boot, the last thing that prints out is
the final printk, Send IPI.
On the boots without NOAPIC, at the same spot roughly a thousand
(estimated) "Send IPI" messages hit the screen before transitioning to
the initramfs and continuing normally.
In the morning, I can rework the patch to set a global in the first two
cases (Disabling/Enabling local APIC timer), and print the result of
those in the last case, as we know the system will hang there. (I would
have done this before sending the message, but given our timezone
difference, figured this was a good start.)
