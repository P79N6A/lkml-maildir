Not possible on only on _real_ PCI bus.
Example: virtually every laptop has mobile bridge and ISA/LPC/whatever
bridge on the same bus segment. Both are subtractive decode devices -
impossible situation from classic PCI point of view. But it's just
happens because it's _not_ PCI but some proprietary bus, even if it looks
like PCI from software point of view. And sort of priority decode is
certainly takes place there.
