Yes, a well-known phenomenon.
Kernel headers are to compile the kernel.
They are not for inclusion in user programs.
(This fact of life means that one has to use a private copy.
That is good, keeps the source stable, also when the kernel changes.
But it is also bad - such information as structure definitions
and manifest constants ought to be in a single place, used by
libc and kernel.
I get the impression that Linus will accept a nice rewrite
of all includes. Remains the question what wishes Ulrich has
on a revised setup. So far Ulrich has not answered - let me
cc him and see whether he has an opinion now.)
