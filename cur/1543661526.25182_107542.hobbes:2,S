It would.  But it shouldn't be passed in for the first time.

Yes, and exactly that's the whole point of it!  The problem with LSM
is that it tries to be overly flexible and thus adds random hooks that
expose internal details all over the place.  Just stop that silly no policy
approach and life will get a lot simpler.  There's no reason to implement
everything and a kitchen sink in LSM.

If you need attributes attached to the sysctl nodes just diable sysctl by
number and use the existing filesystem based hooks.
