Please correct me if I got it wrong: as deamon in this case is not a normal one,
since it never gets rate for its own safety, then it needs an RT lock whenever
system boots.

Wouldn't this bring the (set of ) ranking algorithm(s) back to the kernel? This
is exactly what we're trying to avoid. The way we see the potential for doing 
this is that kernel shouldn't  worry about users decision on which process to 
kill but rather take her/his option into account. The computation of such a
decision could be at user space (protected as you suggested above).
We'll think about it, although I'm not sure if there would be such a decrease 
in memory concumption.
