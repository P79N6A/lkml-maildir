In fact, what you'd want to do is not just verify that it compiles, but 
also verify that the object code matches.
Because there _is_ one case where adding the [1] will still compile, but
generate wrong code: if the "size" argument to the _IOx() was not a type,
but a real actual array.
Now, that would have been a bug (or at least a misfeature) before too, but 
the point of this whole thread was that some people used the _IOx() macros 
incorrectly, so maybe such broken usage actually exists..
