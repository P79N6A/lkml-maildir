There's very little standing in the way of automatic placement. If in
your opinion it should be implemented, I'll add that feature today.
IIRC you mentioned you would like to export the arch-specific
hugepage-aligned vma placement functions; once these are available,
it should be trivial to reuse them.
Thanks,
