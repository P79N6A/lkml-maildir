autoconf.h has always been autogenerated. And autoconf.h has always
been used to publish the configuration to .c files.
What changed between 2.6.10 and 26.22 are the algorithm used to
produce autoconf.h.
The interface to the kernel configuration is .config - and overwriting
.config is an easy way to introduce a new config.
autoconf.h is not suitable for this purpose and thus
the actual layout does not matter.
If you used to use autoconf.h for distributing kernel versions before
I recommend you to use .config for now on. This should to my best
knowlege also work for your 2.6.10 kernel.
