I really doubt it.

So you've got /etc/mtab fucked up.  Both umount(8) and df(1) read it
to find the set of mountpoints _and_ to get information about the
stuff mounted there.  Information left there by mount(8).
Check the contents of /etc/mtab and /proc/mounts.  If the latter contains
two lines with hdh1 - you've got a kernel bug.  If doesn't and /etc/mtab
does - userland bug in mount(8), talk to util-linux maintainer.
