I have not got CML2 support working in kbuild 2.5 so I left a bit of
room between kbuild 2.5 going in and cutting over to CML2.  _If_ I can
get CML2 support working before 2.5.1 comes out then we go
  2.5.2-pre1 Add kbuild 2.5 with both CML1 and CML2 support.
  2.5.2-pre2 Remove kbuild 2.4.
  2.5.2-pre3 Remove CML1.
  2.5.2
I would prefer that sequence myself, but I don't want to promise a
timetable that I cannot deliver.
