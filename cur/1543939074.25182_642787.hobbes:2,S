the original topic name is : why linux kernel crap ...
the substance is, when from kernel call users-pace program, then come
up more problems with security...
when the fs crash out or the userspace code is breaked, then the
system not shuting down ..
and when it is only code duplication cleanup, then is unneaded for
2.6.22, thanks and, sorry for bad spelling.
