I'm just courious if anybody tried a multiple-run queue scheduler.
More precisely, when a process belongs to a run queue which represents
it's priority in some way.
For example in functions add_to_runqueue, move_last_runqueue,
move_first_runqueue instead of doing
	list_add(&p->run_list, &runqueue_head);
do
	list_add(&p->run_list, &runqueue_head[p->priority]);
and then in schedule():
for (q=MAX_PRIORITY; q>=0 && !found; --q) {
	tmp = runqueue_head[q].next;
	while (tmp != &runqueue_head[q]); {
		p = list_entry(tmp, struct task_struct, run_list);
		if (can_schedule(p)) {
			int weight = goodness(p, this_cpu, prev->active_mm);
			if (weight > c)
				c = weight, next = p, found = 1;
		}
		tmp = tmp->next;
	}
}
..has anybody tried something similar?
