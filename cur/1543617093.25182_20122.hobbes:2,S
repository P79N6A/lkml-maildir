Oh, please...  Give me permissions sufficient to make these syscalls
and in a couple of minutes your kernel will be replaced with ELIZA.
As a bonus - ELIZA running under TOPS-10 on PDP-10 emulator.  And talking
to PARRY.
Anyway, it's trivial to disable said system calls just before doing
execve("/sbin/init",...).  It won't buy you any security, but if you
insist...

_That_ has to be addressed - regardless of anything else, if that suckitude
can be fixed it should be.

FVO"quite a few" equal to 2.  Kernel and initramfs.cpio.gz
