Right.

Well, at least on Alpha, gcc can optimize them all away except one.
Note I'm not really arguing Linux should use a lookup table for fls;
I'm just arguing putting it as default into libgcc for architectures
that don't provide a special version (which aren't particularly many)
isn't stupid. But probably I'm just biased, because I put it there :)
