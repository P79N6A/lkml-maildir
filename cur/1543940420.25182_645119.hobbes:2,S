The "SCSI support type (disk, tape, CD-ROM)" section of that menu actually 
applies to all ATA-command-set devices that don't use the old IDE code. 
For example, usb-storage uses "SCSI disk" out of that section, and 
I've only seen "Probe all LUNs on each SCSI device" be needed for a 
particular USB card reader with two slots. At this point, most of the 
things in the kernel that refer to SCSI probably should say "storage" (or 
"ATA", really, but that would make the acronyms confusing).
Incidentally, you should be able to save debugging time for problems like 
missing "sr" by building it as a module, which will build really quickly 
and not require a reboot to test.
