Of course not, you cannot change the way the command works now. This was
at the time when the proposal was being added, however.
There are still the feature register which is reserved for write fua,
that could be used. For some odd reason t13 prefers to add seperate
opcode for the identical command, instead of just using option bits. But
you could just flag an ordered bit for WRITE_DMA_EXT_FUA, that would
work wonders.

I don't think anyone in their right mind would expect that. Of course in
10 years time we can all laugh at this when the tables have turned :-)
