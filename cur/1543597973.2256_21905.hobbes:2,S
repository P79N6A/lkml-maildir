   2. This macro doesn't produce a warning like the typeof version does.
   The typeof version warns you about signed/unsigned compares, while an
   assignment gives no warning.
That is a legitimate operation, there is no reason to prevent people
from comparing signed and unsigned values.  These type argument
min/max values allow people to specify what the comparison type
degenerates into.
