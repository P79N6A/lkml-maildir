           Summary: DHCPOFFER is ignored at boottime
    Kernel Version: 2.5.65
            Status: NEW
          Severity: high
             Owner: acme@conectiva.com.br
         Submitter: kc0@hotmail.com
Distribution: Debian sid
Hardware Environment: toshiba satellite pro 6100, e100 driver.
Software Environment:
Problem Description:
2.5.64 didn't have this problem using the same .config file.
This is what I see at boottime:
DHCPREQUEST on eth0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67
DHCPREQUEST on eth0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67
DHCPREQUEST on eth0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval 3
DHCPOFFER from 192.168.0.1
this is where the kernel should continue booting but instead it goes on with:
DHCPREQUEST on eth0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67
DHCPREQUEST on eth0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67
DHCPREQUEST on eth0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval 4
DHCPOFFER from 192.168.0.1
DHCPREQUEST on eth0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67
.
.
.
Steps to reproduce:
compile 2.5.65 and boot
