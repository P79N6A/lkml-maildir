That's not quite true, LINUX_COMPILE_TIME and UTS_VERSION are
explicitely excluded from the comparison when checking whether
linux/compile.h changed. This is done in scripts/mkcompile_h, and I
believe this part works properly. This script wasn't modified recently.

It definitely is, which is why I am reporting it and am asking for it
to be fixed. I isolated the two responsible commits elsewhere in the
thread.
