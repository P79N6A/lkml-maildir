Hi,
As per a previously stated email the patch for ptrace to 2.4.20 can
be found at 
http://www.hardrock.org/kernel/2.4.20/linux-2.4.20-ptrace.patch
This really only fixes the failure for the sched.h patch
to apply and removes the um tree from arch.
There of course are other minor changes (offsets etc).
It does compile on i386 and does boot.  YMMV...
Regards
James Bourne
