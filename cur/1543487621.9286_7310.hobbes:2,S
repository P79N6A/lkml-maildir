I think that is *is* the same problem.

I think that you misunderstood me. The problem (as I diagnosed it) was
that Solaris sometimes ignores the FIN flag in TCP packets with data.
However, it processes the data. [As I recall it would ignore the FIN
on a packet received when there was a gap in the receive sequence space.
Then when the retransmitted packet arrived, it was being dropped as
a duplicate.] 
The fix was to make sure that we did *not* retransmit the data, but
*do* retransmit the FIN. When Solaris receives the FIN without data
it handles it correctly.

The point is *not* to retransmit the last full packet, but just
retransmit
the FIN. [This is more economic on sending data anyway]
