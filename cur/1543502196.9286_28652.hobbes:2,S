I think this is as good time as any. Actually better because 2.2.x is now
"ready" and 2.3.x is there to break things again... :)

2.2.x is considered production quality and at least for me it _is_ stable.
If you have found a reproducible bug then _please_ report it to the
correct people!
The utilities stuff is a completely different matter. We are rapidly
progressing with them and soon we'll have utils that work for everyone.
Matthias' efforts on making the kernel side of Linux AX.25 even better is
nothing away from the rest of us. Besides soon we will be able to tell
those people who are always mocking Linux AX.25 performance to err...
well, let's leave it there... :-)

Well I thought it is already. Or is there something I've missed?
