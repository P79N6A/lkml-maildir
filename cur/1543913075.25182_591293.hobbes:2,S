OK, I personally don't care that much. Andrew, the version as per Franck's 
suggestion is below. It should be functionally equivalent to the patch 
sent in my previous message in this thread, please consider merging one of 
them. Thanks a lot.

i386 and x86_64: randomize brk()
This patch randomizes the location of the heap (brk) for i386 and x86_64.
The range is randomized in the range starting at current brk location up
to 0x02000000 offset for both architectures. This, together with
pie-executable-randomization.patch and
pie-executable-randomization-fix.patch, should make the address space
randomization on i386 and x86_64 complete.
