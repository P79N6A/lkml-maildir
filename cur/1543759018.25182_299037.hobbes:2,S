This way you have a fixup tree for the latest 2.6.x release, but does
not resolve the problem of the release quality itself.
It makes more sense to do
2.6.x-pre1 .. preX in your tree until you feel comfortable to move it
into the release tree, where it starts from
2.6.x-rc1 .. rcX bugfix only up to the final release.
>From the release to the next -preX to -rc1 move this tree only handles
the real trivial and urgent fixes and produces 2.6.x.y updates. When the
next -rc1 appears the previous 2.6.x.y is frozen and never touched
again.
This way you have ongoing development in your tree and the -rcX releases
might find more testers than now.

I think when the rules are clear and some gratification would be
available you might find somebody to jump on this train.
