And by my count (RH 7.3) that comes to 52 for /usr/bin/*
of those 52:
	rdist has 12 entries of its' own.
	rdistd has 7 more.
The majority of the comands deal with mail(7), and postgres (8).
Of the compiling ones: lex and yacc show one each, gprof has two.
The rest all have one reference.
Of these only those dealing with the network (telnet, ftp rdist,rdistd...) 
would be considered part of the core utilities - and even then they are
discouraged in use (weak security).
The rest of the files (3080) do not have a BSD base.
In /bin/* I find only 4. /bin/csh, /bin/mail, /bin/ping and /bin/tcsh.
Of these I only consider /bin/ping  a core utility.
In my opinion, that is not enough to claim a BSD foundation.
