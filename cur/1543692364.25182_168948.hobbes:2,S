What about the following solution (the names and help texts for the
config options might not be optimal, I hope you understand the
intention):
config IPV6_SUPPORT
	bool "IPv6 support"
config IPV6_ENABLE
	tristate "enable IPv6"
	depends on IPV6_SUPPORT
IPV6_SUPPORT changes structs etc. and IPV6_ENABLE is responsible for 
ipv6.o .
