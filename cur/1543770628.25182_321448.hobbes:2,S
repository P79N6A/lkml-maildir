the idle thread is the first thing that gets on the runqueue of 
secondary CPUs. It's really just the boot process that has this 
inevitable 'we do some stuff before the scheduler has been set up' 
sequence. Secondary CPUs _must not be active_ before their idle thread 
has been set up. (which would be the source of other bugs as well.)

it's slightly smaller code.
