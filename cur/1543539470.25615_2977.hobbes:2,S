You didn't read my email did you?
I suggest you go back and re-read it.

Sure. Many devices have upgradeable firmware. I'm sure sending garbage
as firmware will make some devices a paperweight.
We don't know what can and can't do harm in these cases so we don't even
try to prevent.

I can do that too.
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/kmem
The machine will panic or mysteriously hang. Any other root logged in
cannot stop the attack since the crash will be pretty damn quick.
I assume you're talking about damaging the hardware than crashing the
system. If there's an easy way of fixing the problem, fix it. It looks
like you have a small patch which would prevent people from abusing or
using by accident that ioctl call to damage their hardware.
Just don't pretend that this completely solves the problem because it
doesn't. It solves this one case and makes it harder to hang yourself,
but you can still hang yourself.
