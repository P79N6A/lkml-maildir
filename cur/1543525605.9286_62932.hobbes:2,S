I got this message,
        eth0: Out-of-sync dirty pointer, 49937 vs. 49954, full=1.
just before an Oops message (a really long one and something about
killing in interrupt handler) and total crash (so no oops saved).
This hasn't happened before (<=2.3.42). I was just doing my daily 
	apt-get update && apt-get -y -m upgrade
when this crash happened.
My hardware configuration:
	k6-2 450, 128 MB, asus p5a
	Buslogic bt-930 SCSI card 
	SMC EPIC/100 network adapter
	sblive sound card	(no driver loaded during the crash)
	3 SCSI devices, 1 ide hard disk and 1 ide cdrw-device
My config-file for the kernel is located at
