I agree, and that was the point of 'picture of me hanging head in
shame', so there's no need to rub it in.
Anyway, the TP600X w/ vanilla DSDT *was* unsupported (circa 2.6.11),
but now the ACPI interpreter can interpret the vanilla DSDT and go
into S3 sleep (before, it would complain about a missing S3 sleep
object because the DSDT used a funny syntax).  There were other
problems in the vanilla DSDT (e.g. probably using fn-F7 to switch to
an external display doesn't work) but I'll investigate them one at a
time.
