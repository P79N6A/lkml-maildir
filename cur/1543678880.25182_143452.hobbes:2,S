	One point probably worth making in this mess of discussion is that
BSD-style open source software reduces the cost of developing and improves
the quality of commercial software. As such, at least this portion of the
open source movement contributes to commercial innovation.
	Or, to put it another way, if everything is open source, *all* you can sell
(at least in terms of selling software) is innovation.
