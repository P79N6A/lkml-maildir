i applied the NAPI patch. this did improved the performance. but i wonder if it is stable because it's new to me.
i used tc to apply the trffic control. that's a little complicated. and i have not tried policy routing. anyway that's a good idea adn i'll try latter.
i still wish there could be some way to simplify netfilter and improve the perform.
