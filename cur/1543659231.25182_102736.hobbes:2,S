Well, "soon" here is > 12 months away, of course.  And most of it

I think you missed the "work around what we can't change" (eg. always
initializing per-cpu variables because Sparc's toolchain is broken, or
adding that crazy restart stuff so we didn't have to create a one-arg
re-enterable nanosleep then make glibc use it).
And, of course, the other Golden Rule: "if it's not x86, it doesn't
matter" 8)

While ET_DYN modules are a reasonably serious win for ia64 (and
probably hppa) (ie. -300 lines or so), they're a minor win for alpha
and ppc64 (-100 lines or so), and no real change for arm, i386, ppc,
sparc, and sparc64.  It's a lose for x86_64 (toolchain fixes, unless
they want to use -fPIC for modules), mips and mips64 (major toolchain
fixes, unless they want to use -fPIC for modules and stop using r28
for current inside modules).
So, if I were ia64 maintainer, I'd be lobbying for ET_DYN modules now,
too, but I don't it's a big enough general win to outweigh the other
problems.
Sorry,
Rusty.
