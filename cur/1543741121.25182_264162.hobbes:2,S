Subject: Bug? Load avg 2.0 when idle.

Hello,
there is a load average of 2.0+ even if the box is almost idle. (i.e. "top"
shows just one running process: top itself.) Starting two cpu-intensive
processes raises the load average to 4.0+.  How can I determine the
source for the high load, or is this a bug?
I'm running 2.6.9 on a dual-athlon box.
Thanks,
-jo
