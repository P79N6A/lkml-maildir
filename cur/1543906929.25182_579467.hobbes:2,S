Subject: [PATCH 2/2] wait_task_zombie: fix 2/3 races vs forget_original_parent()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/8/5/100

Two threads, T1 and T2. T2 ptraces P, and P is not a child of ptracer's
thread group. P exits and goes to TASK_ZOMBIE.
T1 does wait_task_zombie(P):
	P->exit_state = TASK_DEAD;
	...
	read_unlock(&tasklist_lock);
					T2 does exit(), takes tasklist,
					forget_original_parent() does
					__ptrace_unlink(P) but doesn't
					call do_notify_parent(P) because
					p->exit_state == EXIT_DEAD.
Now, P is not visible to our process: __ptrace_unlink() removed it from
->children. We should send notification to P->parent and release P if and
only if SIGCHLD is ignored.
And we have 3 bugs:
1. P->parent does do_wait() and gets -ECHILD (P is on ->parent->children,
   but its state is TASK_DEAD).
2. // wait_task_zombie() continues
	if (put_user(...)) {
		// TODO: is this safe?
		p->exit_state = EXIT_ZOMBIE;
		return;
	}
   we return without notification/release, task_struct leaked.
   Solution: ignore -EFAULT and proceed. It is an application's bug if
   we can't fill infop/stat_addr (in case of VM_FAULT_OOM we have much
   more problems).
3. // wait_task_zombie() continues
	if (p->real_parent != p->parent) {
		// Not taken, it was untraced'ed
		...
	}
	release_task(p);
   we released the task which we shouldn't.
   Solution: check ->real_parent != ->parent before, under tasklist_lock,
   but use ptrace_unlink() instead of __ptrace_unlink() to check ->ptrace.
This patch hopefully solves 2 and 3, the 1st bug will be fixed later, we need
some cleanups in forget_original_parent/reparent_thread.
However, the first race is very unlikely and not critical, so I hope it makes
sense to fix 1 and 2 for now.
4. Small cleanup: don't "restore" EXIT_ZOMBIE unless we know we are not going
   to realease the child.
