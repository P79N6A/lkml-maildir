Some embedded systems run on batteries, so the less ram they have to
power the better, and the less cpu cycles that have to spend executing
code the less power they consume.  An ADSL modem on your desk doesn't
have any of those worries, it just has to work and if doubling the ram
cuts the development problems by a lot, then that might have been a
worthwhile trade off.
