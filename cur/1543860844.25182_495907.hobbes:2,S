ib_set_cq_udata() would transition into the kernel to pass in the
consumer's index.  In addition, ib_req_notify_cq would also transition
into the kernel since its not a bypass function for chelsio.

Roland, do you have any comments on this?  You previously indicated
these patches were good to go once chelsio's ethernet driver gets pulled
in.

I've run this code with mthca and didn't notice any performance
degradation, but I wasn't specifically measuring cq_poll overhead in a
tight loop...
