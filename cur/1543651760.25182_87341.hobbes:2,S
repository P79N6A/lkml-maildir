It wasn't clear whether it was useful or desirable to keep these patchsets
turning over.  But it will be helpful to keep them as a marshalling point
for people to see what is queued up, to get some additional testing and
stabilisation and for people to sync up against.  And also to keep things
like shared pagetables and dcache-rcu under test.
2.5.46-mm1 includes various fixes to things, Bill's hugetlb rework,
dcache-rcu and shared pagetables.
Also the patches which make the address_space's private_lock and page_lock
irq-safe.  So Badari can run set_page_dirty() from interrupts...
