I suppose I'm lumped in with the "SD advocates" now but you will note 
that I haven't been bickering about make -j5 loads. You cut away the 
entire meat of my reply which was all that predictability harping.
What I did say about make -j5 loads is that I do not think that they, 
under all circumstances, on all machines and at all cost, need to 
perform the same as currently if other situations improve. Do I want 
heuristics? Sure, I'm just saying the kernel is fundamentally incapable 
of getting it right all of the time and as such it should provide me 
with as many opportunities as possible at stepping in. That is, let me 
understand what it is and is going to be doing and then listen to me.
I agree not a lot of progress is to be made if people keep ignoring each 
other like that but also while SD's author is offline. Let's just shelve 
it until he's back. Not bury though...
Rene.
