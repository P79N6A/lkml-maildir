Hi,
with a 2.2.19 kernel I used the routine below to resolve physical addresses
for preparing gather/scatter DMA. Using it on unmapped memory (allocated but
not yet used) it returned zero. Knowing this I could force the mapping of
such memory. Now with 2.4.x kernels I get something like 0x100000 for
unmapped pages.
Even recognizing these as unmapped and resolving anew, produced a frozen
machine once the DMA used these addresses. Was there a change in 2.4.x so
that my resolving routine now works incorrect?
/*resolve virt. addresses to phys.*/
unsigned long ch_get_physpage(unsigned long virtaddr)
{
  /*Stuff for browsing through the memory page tables*/
  pgd_t *pgd_t_dir;
  pmd_t *pmd_t_dir;
  pte_t *pte_t_dir;
  /*Get physical address*/
  pgd_t_dir=pgd_offset(current->mm,virtaddr);
  pmd_t_dir=pmd_offset(pgd_t_dir,virtaddr);
  pte_t_dir=pte_offset(pmd_t_dir,virtaddr);
  return virt_to_bus((void *)pte_page(*pte_t_dir));
}
Mit freundlichen Gruessen / Best regards
