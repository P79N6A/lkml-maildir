Ever since the changes to skb_dataref happened,
The following snippit needs to be changed.
#  define SKB_IS_CLONE_OF(clone, skb)   ( \
      skb_dataref(clone) == skb_dataref(skb) \
   )
Can someone with a clue help me change this so it works?

 Your eyes are weary from staring at the CRT.  You feel sleepy.  Notice how
 restful it is to watch the cursor blink.  Close your eyes.  The opinions
 stated above are yours.  You cannot imagine why you ever felt otherwise.
