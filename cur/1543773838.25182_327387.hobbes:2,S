Hi,
I am loading an non-gpl module. I am getting error:
"no version for struct_module found":tainted kernel.
Its for > 2.6.8 kernels.
I know that I get tainted kernel error when its not
GPL, but what does the error "no version for
struct_module found" mean?
How to get rid of this?
I checked the module.c under kernel dir, I guess I am
getting this error for 
if(!(tainted & TAINTED_FORCED_MODULE)...
with regards,
   Anil
