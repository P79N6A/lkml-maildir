Hmm. Can you please go back in the -hrt project history:
http://tglx.de/projects/hrtimers/2.6.23-rc5/patch-2.6.23-rc5-hrt1.patches.tar.bz2
http://tglx.de/projects/hrtimers/2.6.23-rc4/patch-2.6.23-rc4-hrt1.patches.tar.bz2
Also, can you send me your .config file please ?
Vs. the suspend / resume wreckage of rc6-mm1 / rc6-hrt2: 
I'm still fishing in rather dark water. Depending on the added
instrumentation points the problem mutates up to the point where it
vanishes completely. The hang, which requires key strokes again, happens
consistently at the same place:
The notifier call in kernel/cpu.c::_cpu_up()
       ret = __raw_notifier_call_chain(&cpu_chain, CPU_UP_PREPARE | mod, hcpu,
                                                        -1, &nr_calls);
does not return, but _all_ registered notifiers are called and reach
their return statement. This reminds me on:

Sigh. I have no clue where to dig further.
