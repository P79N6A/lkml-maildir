This is yet another holding action, a port of my page coloring patch
to the 2.5 kernel. This is a minimal port (x86 only) intended to get
some testing done; once again the algorithm used is the same as in 
previous patches. There are several cleanups and removed 2.4-isms that
make the code somewhat more compact, though.
I'll be experimenting with other coloring schemes later this week.
