If you look at do_mmap in mm/mmap.c you can see that your parameters
cause an overflow:
	[...]
        /* offset overflow? */
        if (off + len < off)
                return -EINVAL;
	[...]
And it wouldn't even help you to change the size argument since the size
gets aligned to a page-size (0x1000) first:
	[...]
        if ((len = PAGE_ALIGN(len)) == 0)
                return addr;
	[...]
Maybe you try to change the expression above to:
	if (off + len - 1 < off)
		return -EINVAL;
