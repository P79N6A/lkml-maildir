dandy.  so why are the interrupts continuing at HIGH RATE
when USB is *completely*idle*?

this needs to be fixed.  I just measured the overhead of this
at 1-2% on my dual celeron/550.  lots of people expect Linux to 
run reasonably on machines with 1/10 this much power; I expect
this mis-feature costs 10-20% on a P5/166.
