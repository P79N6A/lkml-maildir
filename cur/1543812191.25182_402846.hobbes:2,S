The problem is that it's not only excessive, it would entangle us with
mm locking.  Basically, all you want to ensure is that the underlying
memory has the information after you've done (rather than the CPU
cache), flush_kernel_dcache_page() will achieve this.  The block layer
itself takes care of user space coherency.

Yes.

Yes.

No. On parisc flush_dcache_mm_lock is a write_lock_irq ... that will
enable interrupts after it's done (don't ask me why ... I think Hugh did
this). a lot of kmap API callers seem to be in interrupt context and may
have irqs off, so re-enabling would be impolite.

you mean something like kmap_to_device/cpu (or perhaps
kmap_for_read/write?)
