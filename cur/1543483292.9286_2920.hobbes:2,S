If you are thinking about synchronization, perhaps yoou can look at
this patch and see if you find any errors. It seems to work and my
theory is that there are many places in kernel where these kind of
"lock free" mechanisms can work.

+ For RTL we need to make these a little more complex

+ run_task better never be called by an interrupt routine!
+ 
+Cases:
+1. queue_task interferes with run_task
+   worst case is queue task reads the list header and then run_task clears
+   it. This can't happen because queue_task  and run_task both use atomic
+   xchange to change the queue header. The problem that remains is that
+   queue_task puts new head in and reads old head; run_task copies head to temp
+   and clears head. But now run_task will busy wait until queue_task finishes
+   appending the old queue list to the end of the new header.
+2. queue_task runs on two machines at the same time. They must work on
+   different bottom halves because of bit0 in sync. If ProcessorA is enqueing
+   X and processorB is enqueuing Y, one will do the atomic_xchg first. Say that
+   A is first. Then A replaces List with X and reads List.old. Then if
+   B does an xchg, B replaces List with Y and reads List.old==X.  No 
+   problem.
