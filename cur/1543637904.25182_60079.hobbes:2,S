Full story: -rc3-jam1 (==aa1) works ok. Also -rc3-jam2 works. 
But -rc3-jam3 bombed on the dual-p4xeon box, but works on a PIII laptop.
So I tried plain -rc3-aa3 on the big box. It crashes with that
couple oopses.
Can't test on my home dual-pII (SMP but not xeon),
'cause the power source fried recently...
The laptop kernel is built with gcc-3.2 (latest Mandrake cooker), and the
dual-xeon one is built with gcc-2.96 (plain Mandrake 8.2).
