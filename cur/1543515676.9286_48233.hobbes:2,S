Hi all,
I have a special device connected to a serial port on my PC (it is a
microcontroller); the RTS and DTR lines are used to reset it and select
the programming mode.
It seems that when /dev/ttySx or /dev/cuax is opened, the kernel starts by
toggling the RTS and DTR lines. This causes an unwanted reset on the
microcontroller.
Can I work around this? Is there any way to tell the kernel not to touch
the RTS and DTR lines, except when explicitely requested by ioctl's?
[Yes, sure, I can read the source, but the code for the serial port is not
well-commented...]
