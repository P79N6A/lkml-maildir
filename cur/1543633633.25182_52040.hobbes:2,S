Oh, agreed, you can do debugging locks in user-space, but it won't be the
kernel that does anything, it will instead have to depend on something
like "if I time out on the lock, I can explicitly test if the previous
holder (who saved his thread ID in memory after getting the lock) is still
alive and try to clean up after him".
This is what a lot of the filesystem locking code does for the things in
/var/lock/xxx, of course.
No kernel necessarily involved. 
But it's going to have to depend on the politeness of all threads that 
partake in the locking.
