Not studied closely, but your patch looks both too much and too
little to me, Balbir.
Too much in that it appears to bundle in some significant little
locking changes without any mention in the commment.
Too little in that it leaves behind lots of junk relating to the
different control_types: the enums, the different kinds of call
that needn't now be different, no change to the various callsites.
Needs more cleanup, I'd say.  Of course, that could be yet another
separate patch.

Personally, I think it could benefit a lot from a rip-up-and-refactor.
But if we're rushing headlong for 2.6.25, yes, I agree it's too late.
And I'm afraid it's not something I can volunteer for at this time.
