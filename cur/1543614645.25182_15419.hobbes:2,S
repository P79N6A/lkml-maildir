Indeed, this solves the keeping the list up to date with whats
in the tree, and has provision for arbitary numbers of METOO:
fields (Though that could get messy, whats to stop Linus getting bombed
with a zillion additions from people who just want to get their
name in a kernel tarball for free). One way could be approval from
the actual maintainer "Yes, he's sent lots of patches, add him to
METOO:".
It does seem a little messy having them scattered all over the tree
too. Extending top-level MAINTAINERS to add necessary fields could
also be done I suppose.
Dave.
