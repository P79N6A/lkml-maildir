The Linux man page is documenting existing functionality on top of what
the standard requires.  Programmers should ever only require what the
standard guarantees.
I am perfectly willing to support a solution where the time is measured
from process startup time.  The only code using times() I found is
cross-platform and most likely does not depend on the value returned is
usable in isolation (only in a difference).
