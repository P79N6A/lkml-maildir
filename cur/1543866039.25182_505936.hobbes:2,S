Ah, you can't answer this question.  Right:
A) Because there are multiple timer interrupt sources in the system, and we're 
now using a newer (better) one.
B) This measures interrupts.  It doesn't measure jiffies.  Interrupts != 
jiffies.  This is a conceptual issue.
C) /proc/uptime may be of use here.

You find /proc/interrupts showing interrupts to be _unclear_?
