What bits have to setup in a different way? Only the stuff in
wm97xx_acc_startup() or other things aswell. An irq can be put as utual
into a device's resouce, Setting up bits may be done like other stuff on
pxa, too. e.g. pxa_set_ohci_info.

With my limited understanding of the pxa-wm97xx.c file, the only board
dependent stuff is done in wm97xx_acc_startup() so a different "driver"
for other boards would result in code duplication.
