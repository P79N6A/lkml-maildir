The driver gets my ACK.
Also, I have the Promise 'stex' (previously 'shasta') SCSI RAID driver
in jgarzik/misc-2.6.git#stex that wants merging.
It's been sent to linux-scsi and linux-kernel several times, but
never seemed to make it into a SCSI tree.  I kept it alive in #stex,
and AFAICS it's been ready to merge for a while now.
I'll send it to linux-scsi one more time, sometime this week.
