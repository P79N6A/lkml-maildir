OK then, a simple change to the patch I submitted, and the following
instead...
 Q> dep_arch_tristate '  AM79C961A support' CONFIG_ARM_AM79C961A \
 Q>	ACORN $CONFIG_NET_ETHERNET
The enclosed patch implements this syntax, and CHECKS that the syntax
stated has been supplied, for both `make config` and `make menuconfig`
and I would imagine the same would be easily added to `make xconfig`
and `make checkconfig` as well by those fluent in the relevant
languages.
Note specifically that it requires that the CONFIG_ARCH_ part of the
name of the variable is NOT provided, and as a result requires that
config variables naming the architecture begin with that string.
Best wishes from Riley.
