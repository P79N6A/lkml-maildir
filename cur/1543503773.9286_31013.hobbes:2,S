I compiled 2.2.11pre2 and 2.3.11 with the same set of options to see
how much bigger the 2.3 kernel was.  The results are somewhat
surprising.
This is "size -A vmlinux" with .note and .comment subtracted.

Stock 2.3.11 has 32k more code and 40k more strings.  That's
ridiculous.  It turns out to be the fault of the wait-queue and
page-cache debugging macros.  ld doesn't uniquify strings, so each
occurence of CHECK_MAGIC() or BUG() is another duplicate.

Add 32-byte alignment padding for every string, the increased size of
struct wait_queue, and the code for the macros themselves, and you can
see where the bloat is coming from.
"2.3.11d" is 2.3.11 with WAITQUEUE_DEBUG undefined in wait.h and BUG()
changed to not printk anything in asm/page.h.  With that done, we drop
down to a sensible ~8k of additional code and ~1k of additional
strings, most of which seems to be the new IDE driver.  This kernel is
actually smaller than 2.2, thanks to the elimination of the static TSS
array.
N.B. I haven't actually booted the modified 2.3.11.
