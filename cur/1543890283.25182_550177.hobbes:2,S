Hi,
Sorry for the late reply and thanks to Jeff for stepping in. :)
Since Jeff covered both status of your patches and administrative issues
I would only like to add one small hint for people adding support for
multi-function PCI chipsets (with multiple PCI device IDs):
It makes sense to put addition of _all_ new PCI IDs into the first patch
of the series and send it to PCI Maintainer (Hi Greg).  This should make
all other patches from the series independent of each other (in the usual
case I'm not talking about all crazy scenarios here).  After the patch
with PCI IDs gets applied upstream you may now send all other patches to
the respective maintainers without worrying about inter-patch dependencies
and without maintainers worrying about your patches not applying cleanly.
IIRC Intely guys are using this process when adding support for their new
chipsets and it works smoothly.
[ Yep, this process is the exception from the general "patch shouldn't add
  unused code" rule but the amount of _temporarily_ unused stuff is _minimal_
  and doing it this way saves a lot of time for all parties involved. ]
PS Greg/Jeff If I'm totally wrong on this please correct me...
Thanks,
Bart
