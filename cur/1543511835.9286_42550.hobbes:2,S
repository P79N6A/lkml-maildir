This sounds like an interesting solution, but I have some questions. How
would you merge the 2 sets of ioctl's for the device.
There's the set of ioctl's for the USB specific portion of it, then
there's the set of ioctl's for the deriver specific (lp, scsi, etc).
AFAICT, this isn't going to be easy with the current setup.
