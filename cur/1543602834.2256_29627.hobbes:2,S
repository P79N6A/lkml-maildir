Hi list members,
I've recently encountered the following message on a machine running RedHat's
2.4.3-12 kernel :
"mm: critical shortage of bounce buffers"
I've searched through the kernel sources, but my 'find' just can't locate this
string anywhere.
Why does this message appear (apparently during high network load with the intel
eepro100 driver or e1000 driver). Is bounce buffers really in use on a x86
machine with 2GB of RAM (normal smp RedHat kernel, not enterprise)??
I appreciate any feedback.
Thanks,
