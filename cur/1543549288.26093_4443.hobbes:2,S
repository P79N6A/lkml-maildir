There is a missing case break in net/sunrpc/clnt.c that causes the kernel
to print an extra, spurious message when a Sun RPC (NFS) request is rejected
by a server with the error RPC_AUTH_TOOWEAK.  The missing break also causes
EIO to be returned to the user process instead of EACCES, which seems wrong
too.  I noticed this bug in kernel 2.2.14, but I checked and it's still in
2.4.0-test8, so the patch is still needed.  Here it is.
