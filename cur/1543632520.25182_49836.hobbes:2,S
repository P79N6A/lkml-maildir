It'll waste 9 drives, giving me a total capacity of 7n instead of 14n. 
And, by definition, RAID-6 _can_ withstand _any_ two-drive failure.

With a 1500MHz Athlon on a typical file server where there's not much 
writes, the CPU is sitting there chrunching RC5-64 som 99,95 % of the 
time. I don't think it'll make much differnce with today's CPUs
