Introducing new interfaces in hex is a mistake. All hex stuff has to go eventually.
I don't know how many times I have had to explain that 08:12 is not /dev/sda12
but /dev/sdb2. Having names use decimal and numbers use hex is just confusing.

Yes. A device number is an opaque number that identifies a device.
Userspace should not attempt to see structure there.
