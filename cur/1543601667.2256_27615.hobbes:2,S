  Hi, Linus. I now find that drivers/char/sonypi.h has been broken in
2.4.10-pre12. I get the following compile errors:
sonypi.h:195: `SONYPI_EVENT_PKEY_P1' undeclared here (not in a function)
sonypi.h:195: initializer element for `sonypi_pkeyev[0].event' is not constant
sonypi.h:196: `SONYPI_EVENT_PKEY_P2' undeclared here (not in a function)
sonypi.h:196: initializer element for `sonypi_pkeyev[1].event' is not constant
sonypi.h:197: `SONYPI_EVENT_PKEY_P3' undeclared here (not in a function)
sonypi.h:197: initializer element for `sonypi_pkeyev[2].event' is not constant
make[2]: *** [sonypi.o] Error 1
I have no idea what the values should be, so I'm unable to generate a
patch. Hopefully the guilty party (i.e. the lazy bastard who sent in a
broken patch without bothering to compile the fucking thing first)
will be shamed into generating a patch ASAP.
Yes, I'm annoyed. So much for syncing up tonight with -pre12, testing
(yeah, some of us still believe in TESTING), and thence onto coding.
I've spent the evening flushing out other people's turds. Grrr.
