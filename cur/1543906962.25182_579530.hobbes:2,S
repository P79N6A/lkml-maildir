Hello and thanks for your reply. 
The cron job that is running every 10 min on my system is mpop (a 
fetchmail-like program) and another running every 5 min is mrtg. Both 
normally finish within 1-2 seconds. 
The fact that these simple cron jobs don't finish ever is certainly because of 
the high system CPU load. If you see the two_discs_bad.txt which I attached 
on my original message, you'll see that *vmlinux*, and specifically the 
*scheduler*, take up most time. 
And the fact that this happens only when running two i/o processes but when 
running only one everything is absolutely snappy (not at all slow, see 
one_disc.txt), makes me sure that this is a kernel bug. I'd be happy to help 
but I need some guidance to pinpoint the problem. 
Thanks, 
Dimitris
