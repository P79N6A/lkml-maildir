I am sure I don't count (not being a vendor), but Intermezzo offers
support for this (they are waiting on feature freeze to redo it to 2.5
according to an email I have).  I want this stuff.  Yes, u+g+w is nice,
but good ACLs are even better.  Please, if this is technically correct
in implementation, do put it in.
Thank you,
