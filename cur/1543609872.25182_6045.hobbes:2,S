   Unfortunately so. We will definitely be looking to decouple hardware and
   software page sizes (like sparc64 is doing) once things stabilise, a
   4KB page size is pretty small for a 64 bit arch.
Using an 8K page size should really be transparent to
any sane ELF userland, why not just do it?  Is there
some hardcoded dependency in the ppc ELF stuff or is
it just a "some of our kernel code still assumes PAGE_SIZE
= 4K"?
