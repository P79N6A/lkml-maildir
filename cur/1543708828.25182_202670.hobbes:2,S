Allready thought about that, tried that but no real
difference:belfish:~# uname -a
Linux babelfish 2.6.3-mm4 #3 Fri Feb 27 14:09:38 CET 2004 i686 GNU/Linux
babelfish:~# /sbin/hdparm -a 4096 /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
setting fs readahead to 4096
readahead    = 4096 (on)
babelfish:~# hdparm -t /dev/hda
Timing buffered disk reads:  110 MB in  3.02 seconds =  36.47 MB/sec
I just installed a news amd64 en few 19" servers.
But none of them showed downgrade in performance when i upped the
kernel.
Possibilities left (according to me!)
- scheduler (should i try different setup ?)
- irq problems (in combination with acpi?)
  i booted with acpi=off and retested but same results.
- driver, specific the via-onboard.
No luck so far!
