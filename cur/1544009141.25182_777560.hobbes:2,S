security_dentry_open() receives "struct file *", so I think we don't need
separate hooks for open(O_RDONLY).

Yes. Thus, I want to pass a caller identifier to mnt_want_write() so that
we can skip calculating vfsmount's pathname when it is not interested for
a LSM module (e.g. mnt_want_write() called for updating atime/ctime/mtime
checks).
May I add "int caller_id" to mnt_want_write()?

OK.
