A pure 2.4.0-test1 kernel also has the bug. It is actually quite easy
to test for:
* fire up the kernel and innd
* inject a couple of articles using rnews
* note the numbers listed for the newsgroup in the active file
* restart innd and check the active file again
If it has the bug, the active file will forget all updates after inn
is restarted. This happens with 2.4.0-test1 also.
