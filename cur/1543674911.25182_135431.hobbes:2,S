Subject: 2.5.69-bk19 "make" messages much less informative
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

	2.5.69-bk19 dumbs down the messages from make into a format
like so:
  CC      arch/i386/kernel/doublefault.o
  CC      arch/i386/kernel/acpi/boot.o
  CC      arch/i386/kernel/acpi/sleep.o
  AS      arch/i386/kernel/acpi/wakeup.o
  LD      arch/i386/kernel/acpi/built-in.o
  CC      arch/i386/kernel/cpu/common.o
	This is much less informative than seeing the actual CC commands.
It impedes people doing their own debugging and people helping others
remotely (because they want to know exactly what options were passed
to gcc).
	Also, I used to be able to copy and paste the gcc command
for compiling a particular file when I'm trying to get rid of compiler
errors.  As a result, this change slightly reduces the amount or quality
of software that I write in a given amount of time.
	Please revert it.
