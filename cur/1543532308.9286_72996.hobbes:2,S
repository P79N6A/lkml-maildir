It's the additional context switches and _added_ cache clears that bother
me. I'm thinking about it though.
The key issues are that: core kernel performance should not be harmed
for low latency and rescheds should not take the place of design for
low latency.

Couple of milliseconds would be very solid and would be useful for many
applications using RTLinux as well as non-RTLinux multimedia, but 
my personal feeling is that if we have to increase latency to make 
Oracle or gcc or a  file system run faster, then the latency should
be sacrificed.

RTLinux gets low microsecond worst case latencies.
