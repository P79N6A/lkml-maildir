Hello.
Iam trying to get the kernel debugger that i got from
http://reality.sgi.com/slurn_engr/
to work. i can get this to compile in 2.2.4 and also 2.2.5 
then i enter kdb using the pause key i can enter kdb prompt and all commands
work except when tru 
to exit using the "go" command it always beeps once and just freezes.
anyone ran into the same problem? and found a fix. Iam having a pentium pro
system. 
Cheers,
ashokr
Plug-and-Play is really nice, unfortunately it only works 50% of the time.
To be specific the "Plug" almost always works.
