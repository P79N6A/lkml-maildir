I tried to compile bk2 with the new radeofb patch, but it failed.
The problem exists if you have enabled drm for radeon, because
radeon_engine_reset is declared twice, once in drivers/char/drm/
radeon_cp.c and the second time in drivers/video/aty/radeon_accel.c.
The attached patch just renames radeon_engine_reset to
radeonfb_engine_reset in drivers/video/aty and also radeon_engine_init
to radeonfb_engine_init just for consistency. It compiles fine, but shows
garbage on my notebook. Don't know if it is my patch or the new radeonfb
code.
