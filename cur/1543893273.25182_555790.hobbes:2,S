Good luck convincing all contributors to do that.
Personally I'm happy with GPL v2, and I for one won't be
dual-licensing anything I contribute until I see a clear benefit of
doing so (and I don't yet).
In any case, this whole debate is still a bit premature since GPL v3
has not even arrived in its final form yet.
