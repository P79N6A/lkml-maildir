I think that the rlimits are a good idea in themselves but not as a 
solution to this problem.  I.e. having a RT CPU rate rlimit should not 
be a sufficient (or necessary for that matter) condition to change 
policy to SCHED_OTHER or SCHED_RR but could still be used to limit the 
possibility of lock out.  (But I guess even that is a violation of RT 
semantics?)

PS Zaphod's per task hard/soft CPU rate caps (which are the equivalent 
of an rlimit on CPU usage rate) are only enforced for SCHED_NORMAL tasks 
and should not (therefore) effect RT semantics.
