I don't know (yet) whether rc5-mm3 was OK in this respect, I didn't boot 
it on this machine. I only know that both rc5 and rc5 + e1000 tree are OK, 
but rc5-mm4 panics on ifconfig/dhclient on e1000 card immediately on my 
system.
I will start bisection when I get back to the respective machine 
(tomorrow) and will let you know.
