And "really, really" depends on context.  I know that you're
working in some contexts where "really, really" means "virtually
never", but that's not the only context folk work with.
Of course, "never ... unless really really necessary" can fight
against the principle of "as simple as practical".  Tradeoffs
somehow never seem far away in engineering, somehow.

Sure, but NONE of the code in question started out that way.  And last
time I audited USB locking code, there was none like that.  So I don't
know where that pseudocode came from; if any code is like that today, it
could be hiding non-SMP bugs too.  The only cases where "local_irq_enable"
is used, it's paired with "local_irq_disable".
And the only places either is used relate to some tricky lock hierarchy
games that need to be played when canceling URBs ...  where usbcore has to
account for the fact that the URB being canceled may _at that instant_
be in the middle of being given back to the device driver (from the
HCD, via usbcore) by an IRQ handler on another CPU.  There's no "naked
disabling" at all; it's used exclusively when two different irq-safe
locks need to be coordinated.

But as I pointed out, that answer was incomplete.  Or maybe it
only addressed some of the code paths, not all of them.  Not
all the issues are "mostly historic".

I think all the locks inside usbcore and the HCDs will end up
being "irqsafe"...

That seems like a good idea.  New Linux developers have often gotten
confused about the rules associated with a given spinlock; and even
when something starts out with good comments, it likely doesn't stay
that way.  Automatic warning about simple mistakes will be a big win.
