Great work!
Did you know that Danilo Beuche has written a Card Services driver for
this device? An old version of that driver currently resides somewhere
in the `contrib' area of 
http://pcmcia-cs.sourceforge.net
 (sorry, I
don't have the exact URL - the internet has stopped).  His current page
is at 
http://www.first.gmd.de/~danilo/pc-driver/
 and his driver seems
fairly current for kernel 2.2.
Could I suggest that you review Danilo's driver against yours? He may
have additional device support, etc.
Once you've done that I'd suggest that we use a common header file
between the ISA and PCMCIA drivers.   I'm open to suggestions on whether
you think a common .c file is appropriate.
Unfortunately your work is based on an older version of the 2.4 driver
and it doesn't include some EEPROM and IRQ work from Jason Gunthorpe.
More unfortunately, the 2.4.0-test9 cs89x0.c isn't up-to-date.  I have a
few minor changes here which I wasn't planning on submitting until
post-2.4.0.
I'd also suggest that we ask David Hinds to review your driver - I'm not
at all familiar with the Card Services interfaces.
Anyway, I'll send you the diffs against the current cs89x0.c and we can
work this off-list a bit, see where it ends up.
