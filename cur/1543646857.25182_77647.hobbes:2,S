Or it the Great Big Lever gives them something to grep for if they want to do 
fine-tuned tweaking and need to find all the places it might pay to give a 
closer look to.

8000 controls you have to individually tweak to do anything is not 
necessarily an improvement over a single "do what I want" button.  (User 
Interface Design 101.)
The doorknob is a wonderful user interface...

Or they could play in the source code if their needs are sufficiently 
unusual, which more or less by definition they will be in this case.  No 
matter how thorough you are here, there will be things they want to tweak (or 
would if they knew about them) that there is no config option for.  "make 
menuconfig" is not a complete replacement for knowing C in all cases.
