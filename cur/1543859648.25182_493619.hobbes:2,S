I modified world-wide used web server lighttpd and ran a lot of tests
with it (compared to epoll version with major performance win).
I was asked yesterday by Jan Kneschke (lighttpd main developer) if
kevent API is ready so he could include my patch into mainline lighttpd 
tree, but I answered 'I do not know if kevent will be or not included, 
everyone keeps silence'.
I just do not know _what_ else should be done not even for inclusion - 
but at least for some progress.
You want libevent to be patched? Its site is currently down, but ok, I
will create a patch.
