I've been thinking about this a bit more...would you even need chroot?
(wouldn't exposing chroot functionality to a user incur additional
security risk?  I guess it would be okay as long as you were only
chrooting to one of your other process' roots?)
If you were organized about where the mounts in your private namespace
were done, you could just mount -bind them from
/proc/NNN/root/home/$USER/mnt (or something).  That requries a certain
amount of discipline in your mounts (or maybe not -- just diff
/proc/NNN/mounts to see what you are missing and bind the
differences).
