That explains a thing or two........if it works and there are no uglies,
it is a DGD (don't give a damn, not a concern) on how the higher levels of
the kernel handle their init() calldowns to the low-level sub-systems,
as long as the llss's are allowed whatever they need to get up and run.
Linus,
How does this proposal effect the cardbus issue from last night?
Fix, mild break, carpet bombing, ..............
This may be a straight forward to design expand upon the need for early
ISR handlers to be inserted and available to cardbus........
Of course this is all out of hat, but the thought has direction in mind
for the latter issue......
