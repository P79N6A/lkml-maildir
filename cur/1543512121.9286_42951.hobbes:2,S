eh??? where the hell are you getting that from? configuration is done is
userspace. You're straying into the realm of FUD, and inviting this debate
to be stretched out even further.
Also, about your config thing. You say you'd have to spend time configuring
the permissions according to the different needs of each lab, and of
different servers.
NEWS: if your needs vary so much, you'd have had to do it with static /dev
too. 
NEWS: if so, you'd save a lot of time editing a simple config file, rather
than manually chown/chmoding.
Plus the config file is more maintainable.
