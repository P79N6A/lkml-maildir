So, a combination of the password problem and smbmount dying, maybe? 
Although, I do notice PID regenerations in smbmount every now and
again.  Perhaps it dies because the password is no longer cached?  Going
the other direction (NT to Linux) never seems to fail, even after
rebooting Linux--the connection always seems to be there (hooray
samba!).  Perhaps this is due to the way MS OSs maintain password
caches?  Anyhow, if smbmount dies, then there isn't really any way to
reestablish the connection, because presumably the password cache dies
with it.
What about encrypting/storing password information in a user's
directory, readable only by the user?  This would fail as a long term
solution, of course, due to security considerations and possibly the
logistics of implementation--for instance, you would have to track which
user had mounted the share last, so the remount would know where to find
the information...
Also, re debugging information, do  you think capturing an strace of
smbmount from start to death would be of any use?  I'll give it a shot
and see what happens.
