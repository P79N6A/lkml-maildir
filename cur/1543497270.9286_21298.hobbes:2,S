Hello,
I have installed a file /etc/fb.modes and for the first time I see
the linux logo not with just vesa but with atyfb!!!
As my computer is not so powerfull, I only compil the non working
atyfb in kernel from time to time to see if that's work, and the
last one I had that way is 2.2.7ac1, and I can start in every modes
I want without problem: JUST GREAT!!!
So I tell, I was missing the file /etc/fb.modes and I recompil another
kernel: 2.3.3ac3 but at boot time, in every mode I choose, I can't
see anything on the screen???
Is there chances for me to try other kernels revisons or not, what are
the difference betweem 2.2.7ac1 and 2.3.3ac3 that prevents atyfb working?
I have an ATI Xpert@play 8 Mb AGP.
Thanks for all,
	Greg						ICQ:16624071
