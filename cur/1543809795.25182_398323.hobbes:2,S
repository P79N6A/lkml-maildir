Well, maybe.  I mean, the CPUs all have PAE (in 32-bit mode) and thus
can use 36-bit physical addressing these days (or more in the case of
amd chips).

Hrm, it may be doing this.  I wonder how that works though with 4GB's
of RAM installed?
I originally thought Windows probably allowed the larger addresses
and use PAE but that might not be the case at all.
