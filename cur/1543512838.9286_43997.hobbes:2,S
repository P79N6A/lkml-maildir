I see that the patch submitted by Chris Noe <stiker@northlink.com>
requires a minimum of binutils-2.9.1.0.7.
Chris Noe says:
    Simple patch that takes all the as86/ld86 stuff in arch/i386/boot and
    makes it use standard GNU as/ld. Needs a minimum of binutils-2.9.1.0.7,
    but that's it (that is the minimum per Documentation/Changes for 2.2
    anyway). I'd love to see this squeeze into 2.3 as a 'bugfix' as no new
    features are anywhere to be found, I swear. :)
As I read Documentation/Changes, it currently states that
the minimum binutils required is
- Binutils               2.8.1.0.23              ; ld -v
It also mentions, but does not require 2.9.1.0.15.
Chris Noe says that "This thing has been tested by many people"
but if this is what made it into linux-2.3.21 then none
of those people were running binutils 2.8.1.0.23.
I didn't here back from an Chris Ricker 
   Re: bbootsect.s Error: base/index register must be 32 bit register
on updating Documentation/Changes to reflect this new requirements for 
binutils clearly.
Thanks
