I took your .config listing, put it in a clean 2.2.7 tree, and then 
ran `make oldconfig` on it, and I can confirm the error message. Since
I'm running screen, I can confirm that it's in the `make zImage` step,
not the `make modules` step, so relates to something selected Y rather
than M in your configuration...
From my display, here's the line that resulted in that error message
being displayed:
 Q> ld -m elf_i386 -T /home/rhw/linux/arch/i386/vmlinux.lds -e stext \

That's a horrible command to have to type...
Best wishes from Riley.
