In short, time on the run queue is negligeable.  Time spend waiting
for disk I/O is extensive.  If you look at the graph, you'll see each
disk I/O takes 0.8 seconds, which is about the same as the skip.  This
is on ReiserFS 2.6, laptop (4000RPM) disk, but attached to mains
power.
There's a massive difference between the behaviour with hdparm -u1 and
hdparm -u0 --- I don't see skips with -u1, and the time the disk light
is on is much reduced.  This puts my problem in the IDE layer
somewhere -- which means it may not be the same problem others are
seeing.
