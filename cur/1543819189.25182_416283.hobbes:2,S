Unfortunately the ebents are ambiguous.  On IA64 BUG() maps to break 0,
but break 0 is also used for debugging[*].  Which makes it awkward to
differentiate between a kernel error and a debug event, we have to
first ask the debuggers if the event if for them then, if the debuggers
do not want the event, drop into the die_if_kernel event.
[*] It does not help that IA64 break.b <n> does not store the value of
    <n> in cr.iim.  All break.b values look like break.b 0.  There used
    to be code in traps.c to detect this and extract the value of
    break.b, but a kprobes patch removed that code.
