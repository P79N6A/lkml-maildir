    Eh?  Both formats are very easy to parse;  the first two lines
    are parsed in a snmp-type fashion (pick up the format in the
    first line, use that to decypher the Mem: and Swap: lines) and
    the rest is a simple tag assignment.
Easly parsed? By what?
    C, like G-d himself intended.

    To make sysctl useful you'd have to do proc, and in that case you
    might as well just use proc in the first place.
