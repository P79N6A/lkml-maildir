Sure they gone, I've used "flip" because of tty_flip_buffer_push() has "flip"
in its name.

Yes, I know it is.

Which tree? I see rather different code in the 2.6.17.4, see below.

Wow! The code you've quoted seems to be correct! But where did you get
it from? The version of flush_to_ldisc() from drivers/char/tty_io.c from
2.17.4 got last Friday from kernel.org does this:
	spin_lock_irqsave(&tty->buf.lock, flags);
	while((tbuf = tty->buf.head) != NULL) {
		while ((count = tbuf->commit - tbuf->read) != 0) {
			char_buf = tbuf->char_buf_ptr + tbuf->read;
			flag_buf = tbuf->flag_buf_ptr + tbuf->read;
			tbuf->read += count;
			spin_unlock_irqrestore(&tty->buf.lock, flags);
			disc->receive_buf(tty, char_buf, flag_buf, count);
			spin_lock_irqsave(&tty->buf.lock, flags);
		}
		if (tbuf->active)
			break;
		tty->buf.head = tbuf->next;
		if (tty->buf.head == NULL)
			tty->buf.tail = NULL;
		tty_buffer_free(tty, tbuf);
	}
	spin_unlock_irqrestore(&tty->buf.lock, flags);
Nowhere tty->receive_room is checked in tty_io.c! Am I missing something
or is this change not yet in the released kernels? If it's not yet
there, where can I get it and when is it expected to reach released
kernels?
