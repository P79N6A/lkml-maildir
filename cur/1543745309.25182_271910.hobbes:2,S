Could you please accept this patch? (against vanilla 2.6.10-rc2)
I have tested my RICOH CD-R/RW with this patch (on CD Reading/Writing), and it 
works just fine with DMA enabled.
(Unfortunately I do not have any other drive in the DMA disabled list, and 
hence I could not test for them.)
Thank you.
Hari.
