Subject: [2.6.12-git8] ACPI shutdown fails to power off machine

Hi:
I realized 2.6.13-rc2 would not power off my box anymore, although it
worked fine back in 2.6.12. A binary search of intermediate -git patches
showed that between -git7 and -git8 something broke power down. Every
kernel used has been compiled from sources downloaded from kernel.org, no
additional patches, and .config has been exactly the same.
Searching "gitweb" located at www.kernel.org (excelent tool, by the way;
you rock guys!) starting from "patch-2.6.12-git8.id" tag back in time, I
located a recent commited patch that, when reversed (against 2.6.12-git8)
makes power off work again in my box. Patch at:
http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=cee5dab4856f51c5cad3aecc630ad0a4d2217a85
The commit text points to a bugme entry, that seems not to be applicable
to my situation: stock kernel sources from kernel.org. If you need some
more info (motherboard make and model, BIOS and version, output from
"lshw" or "dmidecode", etc.), please ask.
Greetings,
