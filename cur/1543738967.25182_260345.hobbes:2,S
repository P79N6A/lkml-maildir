just because we never say 'page mapping level 4', we think 'page table
level 4' or 'page directory level 4'.
pte4 doesn't sound nice since we don't use pte3/2/1, but pgd4 could make
some more sense than pml4.
But I'm fine if you prefer to stick with pml4. Those are names we tend
to memorize anyways, I don't actually know what pmd means exactly either
(page middle directory)?
