Yes :)
I was thinking the sched domains soft-partitioning could be a
useful feature in its own right, considering the runtime impact
would be exactly zero, and the setup code should already be mostly
there.
If anyone was interested, I could try to cook up an implementation
on the scheduler side. The biggest issues may be the userspace
interface and a decent userspace management tool.
