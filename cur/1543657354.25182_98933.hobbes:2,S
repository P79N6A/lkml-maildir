Are there other messages?  Something has apparently removed the
important log message of that identified the board and the current
transceiver setting.

Which model?  What era?  A few of the early 3Com switches did have
autonegotiation timing flaws.  Most are managed switches, and the proper
work-around is to set them to forced 100baseTx half duplex operation.

This is because of the Wake-On-LAN capability of the board.  It
continues link beat in soft-power-off mode.  Depending on the
motherboard (if standby-power is supplied through the PCI connector),
you might be able to change the behavior by disconnecting the WOL
cable.  But that's not a solution.

The Windows driver likely resets the transceiver.  The 3c59x driver
avoids doing this.  Rapidly resetting the link results in bad behavior
from some switches, and some Linux configurations results in rapid
restarts of the driver.

You have the debug/message level turned up past the default, and the
driver is reporting that statistics overflowed.  Check the error counts
in /proc/net/dev.  This is likely unrelated.

Try the driver release from

Does 'mii-diag --reset' result in a working link?
