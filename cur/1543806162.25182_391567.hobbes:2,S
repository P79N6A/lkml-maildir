return is int, but the ranges are small enough for a u8, so a wrap might be good. ret == 0 is ESUCCESS _unless_ you are calling HYPERVISOR_xen_version, in which case ret == version.

no, this hypercall is not in any performance path and it also returns major ver and minor ver embedded into the returned int. Good suggestion and no problem calling repeatedly (within reason).

Per the xen headers, this particular hcall option returns a typedef char[1024] thingy_t (which is simply a char [1024] in the patch). Yes, if the page size is < 1024 there is a problem. So a check against PAGE_SIZE may be prudent. 
I'm rewriting based on Greg's and your feedback,
thanks again, 
Mike
