Hello Martin,

Yes, and more than that. You can remove ESTABLISHED entries in the 
conntrack table by sending packets with the RST flag set and matching 
the template <srcIP, srcPORT, dstIP, dstPORT>.

:) You should probably send stuff like that to the netfilter-devel ml. 
Besides that it isn't really an exploit.

You might want to take a look at the TCP window tracking patch which 
comes with the latest pom. It's part of the extra patches. This will 
solve the problems for you.

Welcome to the world of almost-stateful packet filtering. Hey, other 
than that, the 3wahas 'exploit' is old. Also don't I understand why they 
claim that SYN cookies prevent syn flooding. Next time you meet someone 
of the guys, tell them about the backlog queue.
Cheers,
