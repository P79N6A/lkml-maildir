How about something like the patch below?
The  if (!(timeout % 128))  bit is a guess that since 
touch_softlockup_watchdog() is a per_cpu thing it will be cheaper to do the
modulo calculation than calling the function every time through the loop,
especially as the nr of CPU's go up. But it's purely a guess, so I may very 
well be wrong - also, 128 is an arbitrarily chosen value, it's just a nice 
number that'll give us <10 function calls pr second.
<disclaimer>patch is completely un-tested</disclaimer>

Subject: touch softlockup watchdog in ide_wait_not_busy
Make sure we touch the softlockup watchdog in 
ide_wait_not_busy() since it may cause the watchdog to trigger, but
there's really no point in that since the loop will eventually return, and
triggering the watchdog won't do us any good anyway.
