Running 2.6.0-test9-mm4, default as scheduler
That triggerd me to go look at ksysguard, and I've got 70 megs out in 
swap in less than 24 hours uptime with my normal loading.  Usually it 
takes me a couple of weeks to get that much as I've half a gig of 
main memory.  Its also showing about 95 megs free.  Would this leak 
show up there (ksysguard), and if so, in what section?
T'would be nice if xosview were to be made operable, but this kernel 
breaks it.  I used to keep it running in the corner of one of my 
screens.
