I as wondering -- according to Intel's docs they recommend that on a P4
processor to use the PAUSE instruction (aka rep followed by a nop) inside
any spin loop (such as one used in SMP spinlock code) in order to both
improve processor performance and reduce power consumption.
Is this instruction being used in spin-wait loops?  For some reason, I am
having a hard time figuring out whether or not it is being used.  There is
a rep_nop() in processor.h.. but I can't determine if that is being called
for spin lock lock/unlock code.
