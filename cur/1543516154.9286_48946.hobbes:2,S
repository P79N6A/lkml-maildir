What's ironic is that the Unix Way probably predates the system we're
calling "Legacy".

In 2.2.x, it looks at sys_tz, which is set by settimeofday().  I
believe sys_tz defaults to UTC.  (It's initialized to "0, 0", which (if
I'm understanding correctly) means zero minuteswest and zero dsttime.)
So, when I say "set a timezone at boot", I'm referring to something
in the rc scripts doing a settimeofday to set it.  On my RH6.0 box,
this is done by hwclock (as you suggest) from /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit.

Sure:  Make a filesystem driver for Win32 which reads ext2, and move
your whole system onto ext2.  :-)
