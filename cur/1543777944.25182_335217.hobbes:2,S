It is necessary /not/ to put space between "function name" and '(', because
if it is a function-like macro, it does matter. For uniformity, do it for
functions and operations like sizeof too.

But editing a file with tab==4 and editing it later with tab==8 guarantees
a mess.

Such macros are /very/ dangerous. That's one reason why multi-line macros
must be wrapped in "do { ... } while(0)"

Plus annotations for bitwise and such. See Documentation/sparse.txt
