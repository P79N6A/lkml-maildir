Any reason to not have sis.patch.20020808 in 2.4.20 ?
I have been using it with 2.4.19 in the last 3 months without any
noticeable problems.
Against 2.4.20-rc3 I get:
patching file drivers/ide/sis5513.c
patching file include/linux/pci_ids.h
Hunk #1 FAILED at 475.
1 out of 1 hunk FAILED -- saving rejects to file include/linux/pci_ids.h.rej
There were no changes to sis5513.c. I can manually fix pci_ids.h.
BTW, what does
{ "SiS745",     PCI_DEVICE_ID_SI_745,   ATA_133,        0 },
"ATA_133" mean ?
I have an ASUS A7S333 and SiS745 is ATA100, like the SiS735
from my old K7S5A.
