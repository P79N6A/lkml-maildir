Subject: [BUG] deadlock upon 'mv' on NFSROOT in 2.2.7

Hi,
There appears to be a bug in 2.2.6 and 2.2.7 using NFSROOT - a deadlock
when trying to rename a directory within the NFSROOT filesystem. For
example:  
	cd /lib
	mv modules modules-bug
	...... [hang] ......
I found out that:  sys_rename() calls vfs_rename(), which tries to
"down" a lock but fails, so it calls "__down_failed" which calls
"__down". There it waits forever !!
This behaviour is 100% consistent on my system. NFSROOT-programmers,
your kind assistance is appreciated :-)
Oren.
