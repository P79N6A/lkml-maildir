I agree.

Huh?  I said:
temp_max[1-3]   Temperature max value.
                Fixed point value in form XXXXX and should be divided by
                100 to get degrees Celsius.
                Read/Write value.
Where is the ability to use a different scale from different drivers in
that?
Anyway, it sounds like we are agreeing here, so I guess I'll go and
write up the whole document in the new style and post it for comments.
thanks,
