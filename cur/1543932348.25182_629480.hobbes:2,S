That commit is over a year old and it initially distressed me that it
would take this long to show up on a boot test. However, you said this was
to fix MIPS in a follow-on mail and I never made it use arch-independent
zone-sizing which is where CONFIG_ARCH_POPULATES_NODE_MAP comes from. Support
for arch-independent zone-sizing was added for MIPS on Nov 3rd 2007 by commit
cce335ae47e231398269fb05fa48e0e9cbf289e0 (relevant cc added) which is a much
more reasonable timeframe for catching this sort of problem. I believe the
real bug might be in there.
Can you post a full dmesg log with loglevel=8 so I can see what the layout
looks like? My aim is to find out why the start of your mem_map is not at
the start of node 0's mem_map which is what I generally expected with the
FLATMEM model.
Thanks.
