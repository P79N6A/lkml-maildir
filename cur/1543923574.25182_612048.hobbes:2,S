Linux has traditionally had a paranoid fear of 64-bit datatypes just
because GCC doesn't generate terribly efficient code for i386.  I think
that may be the primary reason why CONFIG_RESOURCES_64BIT ever became a
build option.  I doubt resource_size_t is being used in any critical
path so the bloat factor will matter much more than the performance
difference it makes.  Unless you're terribly impatient waiting for your
PCI bus to complete scan or so ;-)
