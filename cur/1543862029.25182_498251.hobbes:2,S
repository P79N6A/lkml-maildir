Speaking of which, why did we obsolete raw devices? And/or why not just
go with a minimal O_DIRECT on block device support? Not a rhetorical
question -- I wasn't involved in the discussions when they happened, so
I would be interested.
O_DIRECT is still crazily racy versus pagecache operations. Chris Mason's
recent patches to attempt to fix it, while actually doing quite a fine
job, are very intrusive and complex for such a sad corner case.
