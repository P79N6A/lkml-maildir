Yes, it's a PITA.  I'm slowly working my way through the maintainers,
see my kernel.org web page.
Here is the copy of my sed script, which works pretty well (you still
have to check for screwed up bitfields, ie:
	unsigned long x:5,
	y:1,
	z:2;
The "y:1" line looks like an old-style designated initializer 8(.
Also, this script doesn't catch all of them, but it breaks the back of
the problem, leaving the rest for the janitors.
Rusty.
