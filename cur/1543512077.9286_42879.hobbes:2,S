	I have a trouble using cfdisk( linux kernel 2.2.10 on PC: PII ):
	when all have been done and write partition information to hard disk, I get
	the following message:
	                    Wrote partition table success, but re-read failed,
	reboot to update.
	Anybody can tell me whether my hard disk has problem or it is a software
	problem?
	and how to fix it?
There is no problem.
The re-read will fail if the disk still is in use.
Reboot.
(With the new blkpg ioctls you could in some cases avoid a reboot.)
