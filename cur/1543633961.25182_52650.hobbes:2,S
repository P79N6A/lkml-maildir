For example, on the 2.5 kernels one might also wish for the physical
path to the USB device in question ... what usb_make_path() returns.
(Simple enough to backport this to 2.4, which some folk have wanted.)
It's a string like "usb-06:0f.1-3.2" indicating first that it's
USB, then that it's the bus with name/serial "06:0f.1" (which in
this case is a PCI function), then that it's connected to port 3 on
the root hub, and port 2 on the hub connected there.  That's a
stable name:  it won't change unless/until you re-cable things.
Right now all of the 2.5 USB network adapters with ethool support
return those strings in the bus_info field, FWIW -- someone else
on this thread mentioned the need to asssign network interface names
based on physical location, and for USB (and likely PCI) that can
be done already.
