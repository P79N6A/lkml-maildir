Hmm...
Try to have a network web server with huge load made on top of
syslets/threadlets.
It is not a TUX anymore - you had 1024 threads, and all of them will be
consumed by tcp_sendmsg() for slow clients - rescheduling will kill a
machine.
My tests show that with 4k connections per second (8k concurrency) more
than 20k connections of 80k total block in tcp_sendmsg() over gigabit
lan between quite fast machines.
Or threadlet/syslet AIO should not be used with networking too?
