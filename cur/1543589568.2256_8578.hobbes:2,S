Yes, we can say this, but people are right to be paranoid.  Remember
that the first version of your patch (several months ago) required a
particular version of GNU Make....
I submitted a cleanup patch for 2.2.18pre that was 100% safe in that it
just made use of a script that was already in the tree
(scripts/kwhich).  But sure enough, it broke for users of older Red Hat
installations who were still on bash 1.x.  It seems scripts/kwhich
hadn't been used that way before, so nobody had noticed that it didn't
work with bash 1.
That said, I think your current version is in fact bug-free and if it
were up to me I would put it in the tree.  But I also understand why
others are hesitant to trust it.  The bugs it fixes are fairly minor,
after all.
