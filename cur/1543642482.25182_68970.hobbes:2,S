UML has been updated to 2.5.33 and UML 2.4.19-2.
Other changes include
	Fixed a couple of jail mode crashes
	Fixed a crash caused by not properly copying the fpstate pointer
during a signal delivery
	Fixed a stupid typo in uaccess.h.
	Ethernet devices now are guaranteed to end up with the same names
that were specified on the command line
The patch is available at
