Actually, FC2 has an CD called rescue CD.  All he needed to do (if he 
toasted his working kernel) was to boot from it, and reinstall the 
kernel package from the first CD (rpm -Uhv --force 
kernel-2.6.5-1.358.i686.rpm or i586, force is needed to push things a 
bit since system thinks the same version of package is already installed).
I'd be quite interested to find out how he managed to toast his working 
kernel.  Not an easy task.  Actaully it is, but requires some manual 
work, it can't be done by just typing make this, make that.  There were 
some steps he "forgot" to mention ;-).
