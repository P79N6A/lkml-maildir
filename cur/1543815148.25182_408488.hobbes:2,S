Subject: [PATCH 100/141] V4L/DVB (3366): Kworld ATSC110: initialize the tuner for analog mode on module load

- Enable the tuv1236 tuner on the Kworld-ATSC110 card so that the
  tuner can be identified when tuners.ko loads.
- With this change it is no longer necessary to remove and reload
  the tuner module in order to get the tuv1236 identified.
- This code was copied from the ATI HDTV Wonder init routine (in cx88-cards.c)
  which also uses the TUV1236D.
