I got into work this morning to find that our server had gone down in a 
similar fashion. It has a 2940UW. The only difference was that we lost data.
I've gone back to 2.1.131 for now, but may try pre-5 with the aic7xxx changes 
reverted next time I get a chance.
Has the new driver enabled tagged queueing by default? If so, might I suggest 
that a late prerelease of 2.2.0 is not the best time to do so?
