No.  For timesharing tasks, the problem is not relevant.  For soft
realtime tasks, it's up to you to make sure that the highest priority
task runnable is actually runnable.  Priority inheritance is not
necessarily a good idea, remember: it can only work by completely
destroying the predictable nature of the task priority ordering that
you had in the first place.
