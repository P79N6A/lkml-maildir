Subject: rcu_do_batch: rcu_data->qlen is not irq safe

rcu_do_batch() decrements rdp->qlen with irqs enabled.
This is not good, it can also be modified by call_rcu()
from interrupt.
So, is it worth fixing? The problem is mostly theoretical.
If yes, is it ok to use local_t ? Iirc, the were some
problems with local_t on some arches. Sometimes it is
just atomic_t ...
Otherwise, we can update ->qlen after the main loop,
	local_irq_disable();
	rdp->qlen -= count;
	local_irq_enable();
What dou you think?
Oleg.
