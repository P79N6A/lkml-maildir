I have to agree - when I worked at the University of California,
a number of us had SGI Indys in our offices. The desktop was
lightning fast, and the graphics were awesome. This is no news
to anybody, since SGI is known for graphics. The big surprise,
however, came when we were trying to find the best nfs server
platform, and benchmarked the SGI just for fun - as it turns out,
a little Indy workstation blew away all other platforms, including
some rather large expensive SPARC boxes, as an nfs server.
So Irix clearly showed the best of both worlds - great latency
and great throughput.
I guess what I'm saying is, there are a lot of proven concepts
in Irix, which work well in real life situations - don't throw out the
baby with the bath water -
