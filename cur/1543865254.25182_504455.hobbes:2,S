Hi Roland-
The client side support for an RPC/RDMA module is almost completely 
integrated into mainline.  There is still a minimal set of patches 
required to support alternate transports in loadable kernel modules 
which Trond has indicated he will integrate when the RPC/RDMA transport 
is ready to be integrated.
At this time I'm not aware of a plan to integrate server-side support 
for NFS/RDMA.  Perhaps the NetApp RDMA developers could respond.
