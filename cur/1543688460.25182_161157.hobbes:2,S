Greetings,
I originally tried to report this to the authors listed in
drivers/scsi/qlogicisp.c, however they appear to be MIA. (:
Anyways, the main problem is that under heavy periods of disk access the
kernel oops's and panics consistantly. This has been a problem ever since
I first installed linux on this machine over 2 years ago. Until now; the
problem was not very evident, only happening every couple months or so.
However recently I decided I'd try a software RAID5 array, and am not able
to get through the initial construction of the array due to the oops.
Here's this vital info:
CPU: Alphaserver 800 5/500 (EV56)
SCSI: Qlogic ISP 1020
Kernel: 2.6.0-test4 (and lower)
RAM: 64MB ECC
Disks: (1) 36GB IBM, (3) 50GB Seagates
gcc: 2.96
Unfortunatly; I could not get a ksymoops report; as it consistantly
segfaulted (2.4.9). (Example below)
However; using "nm vmlinux" and the "pc" register from the kernel panic;
I'm pretty sure the problem is happening within the "isp1020_intr_handler"
function:
fffffc00004de9e0 isp1020_intr_handler
Also, upon boot, the kernel reports this before the Qlogic ISP driver
loads:
ERROR: SCSI host `isp1020' has no error handling
ERROR: This is not a safe way to run your SCSI host
ERROR: The error handling must be added to this driver
(hex deleted)
I'm sure this couldn't be good for business either. (:
Here's the oops:

Let me know if there's any more information that would be useful. Or if
anyone knows what I'm doing wrong with ksymoops. (; Thanks!
P.S. A CC of the reply to my email would be much appreciated.
