Subject: 2.5 ext2fs as a module

On attempting to compile 2.5 from Linus bk tree, it compiles fine, but depmod
gives me unresolved symbols in ext2.o.  It seems as if ext2 needs
write_mapping_buffers
My guess would be to add an EXPORT_SYMBOL(write_mapping_buffers) somewhere in
the code.  WOuld this be correct?
TIA
Erik
