Of course, this means that you have to know beforehand that your
machine is going to panic.  And of course, since the screen is  blanked,
you don't get a clue what caused it so you don't get any information
on how to reproduce it....  We're supposed to be designing a quality
operating system, not something that's a set-up for a Dilbert strip.
Rob Landley is right - there should be a patch to make it go away
if the kernel panics.
