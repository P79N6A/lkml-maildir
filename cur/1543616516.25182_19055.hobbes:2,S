	Didn't solve my problem unfortunately.
	With the patch applied, the kernel still says it uses UDMA(66) on boot 
and hdparm also says the drive is in udma4 mode. Writing data to it results in 
BadCRC.
	However, /proc/ide/hpt366 with the patch applied shows ATA-33 mode. 
Something's wrong here.
	CC'ing this to Andre Hedrick. Maybe he knows what's wrong?
Bye
Oliver
