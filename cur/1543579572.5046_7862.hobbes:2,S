The point of comments is not to "fix" bad code, it's to provide
understanding.  As the original poster said, _you_ may understand your code,
but that in no way implies that _I_ will, or your co-worker down the hall
will, etc.  I'm not suggesting that a statement like "counter=0;" at the
start of a function be commented, but other operations should be.  "Why do
we want this file written in /proc - wouldn't syslog have worked better?"
"Why is this loop skipping the first seven elements?"  "Why is this
structure used here instead of a simple array?"  "What on earth does
m->n->o->num represent?"

Comments should be updated when code is updated.  I believe that
documentation is of far greater value than code itself.  Code can be
changed, however, logic drives the code.  Without a good understanding of
the latter, the former is of little value, IMHO.
