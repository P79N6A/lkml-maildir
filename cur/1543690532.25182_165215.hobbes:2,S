I never assumed they all have the bug.  Credit me with at least
reading what you wrote before! :)
The results indicate some StrongARM-110 systems which _don't_ exhibit
the write buffer bug _do_ exhibit some _other_ cause of non-coherence.

I'm thinking the same of you! :)
All I asked is whether _all_ ARMs appear coherent to userspace now, and
you replied with:

and proceeding to answer a different question to the one I asked.
So, neither of us knows if all ARMs appear coherent to userspace, with
the latest kernel, ...

...until we learn what kernel versions the Netwinder folks are
running, or they kindly run the test on a new kernel.
