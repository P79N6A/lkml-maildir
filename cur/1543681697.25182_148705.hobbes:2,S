The latest tools should work with both v1 and v4 ioctl interfaces,
though there will be an error message when the tools fallback from v4
to v1.
I submitted v4 patches for 2.5 last friday but sadly they haven't been
merged yet.  If you apply these patches you will have to explicitly
enable the v4 interface with 'make config'.
I run the same tools aginst 2.4.21 (v4) 2.5.75 (v1) and 2.5.75 (v4).
