If you mean that with my approach you can't use a 4k filesystem as is,
that's not correct. I even run the (admittedly premature but
promising) benchmarks on my patch on a 4k blocksized
filesystem... Guess what, you can even still mount a 1k fs on a 2.6
kernel.
The main advantage I can see in your patch is that distributions won't
need to ship a 64k PAGE_SIZE kernel rpm (but your single rpm will be
slower).
