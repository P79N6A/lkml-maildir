what about using kzalloc ?

any chance to write it smp_alt_state == ALT_UP ?
IMHO, this way of writting equal condition is backward (like giving
answer before asking the question). I do know of the (pseudo-)benefit
to write it this way, but that's not worth it.
Plus, nowadays, gcc warns you about simple equal in if.
