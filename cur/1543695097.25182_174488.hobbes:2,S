Depends on the compiler version you use...
For gcc-3.x, I'm sure your settings should be:
If you select Athlon 4, the -march flag is set to athlon
If you select Athlon XP, the -march flag is set to athlon

The kernel itself has evolved to its current state because people hand-edited it. The feature you request may be added in the future, it will only be added faster if you care enough to do it yourself and send a patch to this list to share it with others...
