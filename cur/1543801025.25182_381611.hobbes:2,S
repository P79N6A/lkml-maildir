And the winner (by a *big* margin) is...
USB.
rh_timer_func() gets called quite a *lot*. (Looks like every 250ms)
cursor_timer_handler() too. *blinky blinky*
X causes lots of hits to it_real_fn()
(incidentally, the power fluctuation only happens when at the
 console. When in X, it never happens, so we're probably hitting
 this a little too often in that case).
lots of apps cause process_timeout to be hit frequently.
