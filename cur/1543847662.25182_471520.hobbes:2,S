Some of our headers are traditionally included by libc headers.
E.g. sys/stat.h might include asm/stat.h, but must not include
stdint.h.
It's somewhat different for file that are completely outside
of the scope of posix, e.g. <mtd/*.h>, that don't give any
guarantees about what they include.

It would get worse.
An application can now do
#include <linux/types.h>
#include <linux/signal.h>
#include <stdint.h>
but not
#include <stdint.h>
#include <linux/types.h>
#include <linux/signal.h>
If <linux/types.h> includes <stdint.h> itself, the first examples breaks
as well.
I'd prefer to clean up all of our headers so they work with
__KERNEL_STRICT_NAMES and in any order, but that's a lot of work and in
the meantime we should make sure we don't make matters worse.
