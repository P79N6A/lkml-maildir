OK, cool.  We can keep going back and forth or if you wish you can send me
the mailbox of patches and the cset key to which they should be applied 
and I'll try it.
Can you do a "bk lease renew" before you start the process, then do a
"bk lease show" to make sure it took?  When it starts to fail I'd like
to know what time your computer thinks it is.  Is it possible that you
are using your net connection to maintain your date and then when you
disconnect your date warps forward?  Does this always happen at the 
3rd commit?
Thanks!
