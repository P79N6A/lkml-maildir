It's a PPS-input timestamping driver, touching drivers/serial/8250.c
and the like.  No contact with kernel timekeeping code, other than
calling it to obtain the timestamps.
I can send you NTP logs if you like; I just thought they were a bit
bulky for linux-kernel.
I don't think its use of netlink is entirely appropriate, but it works
well enough.
