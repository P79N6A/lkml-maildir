Please don't use "[unsigned] char __iomem *".
Why? Two reasons:
 - it's pointless. You can't dereference it anyway, and unlike a struct or 
   an array, it has no addressing capabilities that "void __iomem *"  
   doesn't have (gcc extension that the kernel uses widely).
   Dereferencing needs "read/write[bwl]()" anyway.
 - it results in horrors like this:
	> -	bc = (struct board_chan *)(memaddr + CHANSTRUCT);
	> +	bc = (struct board_chan __iomem *)(memaddr + CHANSTRUCT);
  which could instead be nicely written as
	bc = memaddr + CHANSTRUCT;
  if "memaddr" were just a "void __iomem *".
I bet the patch would look like a nice cleanup if you did that. Hint, 
hint.
