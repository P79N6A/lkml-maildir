It doesn't crash or segfault anymore. It works with the bitmap file on
tmpfs, but not yet on reiser4.
This is kernel 2.6.15-rc1-mm2 with your (Neil Brown's) patch.
loop0 is connected to a file on tmpfs
loop1 to a file on reiser4
/storage/raid1.bitmap is also on reiser4

It does work with the bitmap file on tmpfs:
# mdadm -C /dev/md1 -f --bitmap=/tmp/raid1.bitmap -l1 -n2 /dev/loop0 --write-behind /dev/loop1
mdadm: /dev/loop0 appears to be part of a raid array:

mdadm: /dev/loop1 appears to be part of a raid array:
    level=raid1 devices=2 ctime=Tue Nov 22 11:20:48 2005
Continue creating array? yes
mdadm: array /dev/md1 started.

Is there anything you need me to test further?
Thanks for the patch!
