I think both patches are actually needed.  The -mm message Antonio
quoted probably refers to the fact that the patch is in your tree, so
Andrew isn't carrying it separately.
The patch called "ignore-vgacon-if-hardware-not-present" on
firstfloor.org is what the name suggests.  It appears to be still
needed, because it still applies.
The patch you've posted here with the subject "i386: ignore vgacon if
hardware not present" is actually i386-eflags-header, but it appears to
have a bad first line, which is why it is posted with the wrong subject.
