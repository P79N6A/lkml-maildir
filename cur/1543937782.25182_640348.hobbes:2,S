> could you please make your queue bisectable?
The idea was that you git revert the original patches I referenced 
and then drop the undo patches since I reimplement all that in different ways
(except for the white space changes, but that can be redone once everything
settled down again). Then it will be bisectable.
Sorry for not making this more clear in the original mail.
