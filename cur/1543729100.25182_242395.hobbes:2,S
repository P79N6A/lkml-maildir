Iteresting idea, here is the /proc/mtrr output:
reg00: base=0x00000000 (   0MB), size= 512MB: write-back, count=1
reg01: base=0x20000000 ( 512MB), size= 256MB: write-back, count=1
reg02: base=0x30000000 ( 768MB), size= 128MB: write-back, count=1
reg03: base=0x38000000 ( 896MB), size=  64MB: write-back, count=1
reg04: base=0x3c000000 ( 960MB), size=  32MB: write-back, count=1
reg05: base=0x3e000000 ( 992MB), size=  16MB: write-back, count=1
reg06: base=0xf0000000 (3840MB), size=   2MB: write-combining, count=1
The memory in question is the block from 896 to 1Gig.  Looks pretty
normal.
At this point I need to recompile "ls" with full profiling and time it
with and without extended memory.  I have a suspicion that it is related
to "mmap" on data in a high memory buffer.  It does not effect actual
file read/write.  Performance on that is pretty much the same.
