I'm munging the 2.3 kiobuf/raw IO stuff at the moment, and yes, mapping
kernel pages is on the agenda.  However, I really really do not want to
see it done this way --- it _must_ be the caller who deals with the
address space stuff, not the low-level raw_rw function.  The IO function
should just accept an arbitrary kiobuf for the IO, no more, no less.
I'm adding a proper set of documentation on the kiobuf IO model in the
current patches to show how it is designed to be used.  Getting the
abstraction right is really important here: it not only results in
cleaner code, it will also enable the IO functions to be reused
flexibly.
