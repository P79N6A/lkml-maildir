No, it's a Sun4c. The Sun4c line compromises of SS1/SS1+/SLC/ELC/IPC/IPX.
From arch/sparc/config.in it looks like Linux doesn't need different
configurations for them (it's just plain Sun4 that's odd there), which
is different from how Solaris handles them (I haven't run 2.6/7 on Sun
hw thought, but I doubt that they changed that).
For more details on on which architecture the different Sun 4 machines
belong to check out:

(The sun-hdwr-ref hasn't been updated for a while, but all older machines
should be there).
