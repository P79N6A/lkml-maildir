No, not yet: it's something which we'll probably do eventually.
However, on any vaguely modern hardware, the track buffers on the disk
itself will keep filling once you've submitted one IO.  Accessing the
next cluster will take a latency hit on the CPU, but we still get the
full disk bandwidth overall.
