Yeah, and nothing we can do about it any more.. Oh, well.
The fact is that the 
	case xxx: ;
syntax is fairly ugly, so I'd prefer the fixup patches to look more like
	case xxx:
		/* fallthrough */ ;
	}
or something (or maybe just a "break" statement), just so that we don't
turn the poor C language into line noise (can anybody say "perl" ;)
I have to say, I think it was Pascal had this "no semicolon needed before
an 'end'" rule, and I always really hated that. The C statement rules make
a lo tmore sense, and requiring a statement after a case statement is
probably a very good requirement from a language standpoint. It's just not
very pretty - but adding a break or a comment will at least separate out
the colon and the semi-colon a bit.
