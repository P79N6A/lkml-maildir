My pleasure.

On the third hand, it would be unreasonable of me to expect Dave to
agree to shoot his products performance in the foot for the sake of my
"more refined" coding style sensibilities.

I could publish an early version of it now, but I am supposed to be
on vacation now with my family, so should avoid starting a discussion
that I shouldn't participate in.

For folks doing really large cpu counts, like my employer, this might

If NR_CPUS arrays start to annoy us sooner, I'll know where to consult.
