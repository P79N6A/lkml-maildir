   It's often a week or two before a test versions is reported on, so
   many times there is no way to serialize the changes.
Think how much faster, and more voluminous, reporting you would
receive if your changes went into the main trees on a timely basis?
You can have the largest test lab, you can have thousands or millions
of cards to verify things on, but it will never be any match for the
cast of wacky configurations that users have who actively test and
beat on the official release and pre-patch kernels done by Alan and
Linus have.
