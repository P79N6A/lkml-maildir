I don't know if this is relevant, but there are some devices which can work 
in either relative (like a touchpad) or absolute (like a touchscreen) mode.  
For example, using a combination of the kernel and the X drivers, at the 
moment I have my Wacom tablet working in relative mode when I'm using its 
mouse, but absolute mode when I'm using its pen.
I'm wondering whether we don't so much need a device class, as something to 
say whether the device works in absolute or relative mode, and that possibly 
we might have devices where this could be dynamically changed.
