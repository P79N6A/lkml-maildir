I think yes, after my patch this path look like follows:
        ret = mapping->a_ops->commit_write(file, page, offset, offset+this_len);
        if (ret) {
                if(ret == AOP_TRUNCATED_PAGE) {
                        page_cache_release(page);
                        goto find_page;
                }
                if (ret < 0)
                        goto out;
                /*
                 * Partial write has happened, so 'ret' already initialized by
                 * number of bytes written, Where is nothing we have to do here.
                 */
        } else
                ret = this_len;
        /*
         * Return the number of bytes written and mark page as
         * accessed, we are now done!
         */
        mark_page_accessed(page);
        balance_dirty_pages_ratelimited(mapping);
out:
        page_cache_release(page);
        unlock_page(page);
out_ret:
        return ret;
}
But off corse this patch does't fix issues spotted by Nick.
