This has been updated for 2.4.1-pre3
- Fixed latency problems with some /proc files and forking
  when many files are open.
- Fixed the tcp-minisocks thing.
- The patch now works properly on SMP.
  If a wakeup is directed to a SCHED_FIFO or SCHED_RR
  task then we request a reschedule on *all* non-idle
  CPUs.
  This causes any CPU which is holding a long-lived
  spinlock to bale out, allowing the target CPU to
  acquire the spinlock and then reschedule normally.
  Bit of a hack, but it works very well and there
  is no impact on the system unless there are
  non-SCHED_OTHER tasks running.
  Five lines of code :)
