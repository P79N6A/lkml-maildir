I couldn't find any documentation on how the ACPI interfaces work, so 
I'm kind of in the dark.
Basically, the IPMI system interface needs information from a specific 
IPMI table to know how to configure itself.  Those tables can reference 
GPEs, so the driver can use those (though AFAIK it has never been tested).
 From spending 30 minutes searching and looking at things, I have no 
idea how to tie this in.  Can you point me to some docs?  Or do I have 
to spend hours digging?
