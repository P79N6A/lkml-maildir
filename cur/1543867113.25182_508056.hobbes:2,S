I don't do it earlier. I do it later. My platform_device structure
is part of my driver's device state structure which is freed
explicitly later after the call to platform_device_unregister().
Is that bad?

They do things differently from each other as well as from mine.
block/floppy.c, for example, just has a call to complete() there.
Anyway, in the latest version of my driver, its platform_device
release function finally does something, too: it frees
dev->platform_data and pdev->resource just in case something
might have materialized there. I hope that's ok.
Regards,
Tilman
