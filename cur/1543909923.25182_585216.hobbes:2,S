I think it is difficult, because die_chain is defined by each architecture.

This is my image of your proposal.
- Print current order
# cat /sys/class/misc/debug/panic_notifier_list
priority   name
1          IPMI
2          watchdog
3          Kdb
4          Kdump
- change list order
# echo <before> <after> > /sys/class/debug/panic_notifier_list
- example
# cat /sys/class/misc/debug/panic_notifier_list
priority   name
1          IPMI
2          watchdog
3          Kdb
4          Kdump
# echo 4 1 > /sys/class/debug/panic_notifier_list
priority   name
1          Kdump
2          IPMI
3          watchdog
4          Kdb
Is my image almost same as your thought?
Thanks
