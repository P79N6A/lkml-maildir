It doesn't really make a difference. As I said, it's exploitable in both
directions. In the other direction, all you have to do is overflow a
buffer passed by a function above you on the call chain. I'm going to
rescind my statement that this is less common - most overflows occur
inside library functions operating on stack variables in an application.
This is actually worse - unless the library was compiled with Stackguard,
you can't protect against it, as the exploit occurs when the library
function returns rather than when the caller does.
Stacks growing downward is not completely arbitrary, either. It's very
convenient to have a known starting point for both code and data. Since
code likes to run upwards, it makes sense to have code start near the
bottom. Since the optimal way to put two growing structures
(code+heap and stack) in a linear array is to start them at opposite ends
and have them grow inward, the stack gets placed at the top. Less of a
concern when you have ridiculously large address spaces like the Alpha,
but still not arbitrary.
