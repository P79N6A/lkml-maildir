this should be fixed but it's obviously hard to identify the problem.
It's unlikely it will help, but perhaps answering the following 
questions might pin it down:
What is the purpose of the machine (client, fileserver,...)?
Which Linux distribution is on the machine?
Any special/unusual software?
What was running at the time of the freezes (e.g. untar'ing a kernel 
source or watching a movie)?
What hardware (e.g. exact motherboard, graphics card,...) is in the 
computer?
