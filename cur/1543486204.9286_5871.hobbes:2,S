The real problem with normal writes was not concurrent writes as much
as writes and truncates taking place at the same time.  If we can rely
on the bmap remaining static throughout the write, then it is far
easier to get things right.

Then why insist in your previous mail that "No, I don't think I'll
ever allow concurrent writes to the same file"?  I *know* that this
has to be a per-filesystem case and that the VFS has to remain
cautious, but the important case, ext2, already has the ability to get
this right.
