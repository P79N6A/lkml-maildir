Interrupt occurs, puts this task in state TASK_RUNNING.

whoops.  We went back into TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE.

We could fix this with changes to schedule(), but that's
not nice.   Another approach would be:
preempt_schedule()
{
	current->state2 = current->state;
	current->state = TASK_RUNNING;
	schedule();
	current->state = current->state2;
}
and wake_up() would do:
	tsk->state = TASK_RUNNING;
	tsk->state2 = TASK_RUNNING;
With the appropriate locking, memory barriers and other
relevant goo I think this would work...
