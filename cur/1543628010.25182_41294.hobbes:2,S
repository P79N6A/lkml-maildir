2 physical - but i'd suggest to test Erich's patch instead. I had
debugging code in the scheduler which did printks, which slowed down some
of the operations in question, such as the startup of the idle thread -
which created weird situations. [which might not occur in normal testing,
but which are possible nevertheless.]
