hi!
i had a non-working network interface today... any hints?
one of our servers is on 2.0.33. when i wanted to replace a 3c905tx NIC
with a DE500 one, i did the folowing:
*) include the de500 driver (de4x5,...) into the kernel (no module)
   make dep, make clean, make zImage,...
*) add "ether=0,0,eth1" to the kernel boot command line (lilo!)
and then i started the new 2.0.33-kernel.
the eth1 device was there, it was configured right, but i couldn't ping
over the eth1 interface. still, no errors occured, but in /proc/net/dev
the carrier column was equal to the error column... (no idea what those
values mean).
then i replaced the NIC with another DE500, and the other showed the same
behaviour. needless to say, both NICs work in other servers ...
kind regards,
