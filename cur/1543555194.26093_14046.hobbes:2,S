With 2.2.18pre22 I get a lot of scsidisk I/O errors on my parallel port
zip.
All pervious versions of 2.2.18pre worked fine. The problem is 100%
reproducible and occurs
after a long period of inactivity (10 or more minutes)
compiled with #define PPA_DEBUG 1 I get:
ppa_fail(3) from ppa_wait at line 319
if you need more information please contact me directly as I am not on
the list
the following partial reversal patch seems to help (but I am not sure it
is correct):
