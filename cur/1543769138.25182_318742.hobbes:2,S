Subject: [GIT PATCH] Stable bugfixes for 2.6.12-rc4
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/5/17/7

Here are the patches that were in the 2.6.11.9 and 2.6.11.10 releases,
syncing up your tree with the -stable tree.  (I can't base the -stable
tree off of your git tree due to the lack of a "real" 2.6.11 in your
tree, this will change once 2.6.12 is out.)
Please pull from:
	rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/stable-2.6.git/
Full patches will be sent to the linux-kernel mailing list, if anyone
wants to see them.
thanks,
greg k-h
