Correct, this was when tmpfs only supported security.* xattrs. I didn't like 
this cleanup very much: it removed some reasonably clean abstractions and 
piled up more crap in fs/xattr.c instead. The security.* xattr code in 
fs/xattr.c is not extensible, which is why this patch needs to bring back 
some of the code that was removed. It would be possible to change that code 
so that it works no matter if an inode has xattr iops, but this would require 
a super_block flag that indicates if an inode's xattr ops implement the 
security.* namespace.
Generic acl support would amount to adding i_acl and i_default_acl pointers to 
generic inodes. I'm not sure if this is acceptable: Ext2, ext3, reiserfs, jfs 
have those pointers in their in-memory inodes but others don't, and generic 
acls only makes sense for memory-based filesystems. The wiring code needed in 
filesystems doesn't seem so horrible to me.
ACLs are slightly different from security labels, too: labeled security 
protection needs a label on everything, ACLs are not needed everywhere.
Thanks,
Andreas.
