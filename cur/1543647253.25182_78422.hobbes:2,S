Subject: [bk/patch] IDE driver model update
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Ok, this basically a resend of the IDE driver model update from two days, 
with two changes:
- Add and use a struct device in ide_drive_t.
- Remove ->release() method() and move call to driver's cleanup() into
  ->remove() (mimicking previous behavior of reboot notifier).
Please apply.
Thanks,

<mochel@osdl.org> (02/10/09 1.730)
   IDE: make ide_drive_remove() call driver's ->cleanup().
   
   This was accidentally dropped before, but re-added now to completely mimic
   behavior of the reboot notifier IDE used to have. 
<mochel@osdl.org> (02/10/09 1.729)
   IDE: Add generic remove() method for drives; remove reboot notifier.
     
   The remove() method is generic for all drives, and set in ide_driver_t::gen_driver.
   The call simply forwards the call to ide_driver_t::standby(). 
   
   This obviates the need for IDE reboot notifier. The core iterates over all present
   devices in device_shutdown() and unregisters each one. 
<mochel@osdl.org> (02/10/09 1.728)
   IDE: register ide driver for all ide drives; not just for disk drives. 
     
   This adds
         struct device_driver    gen_driver;
     
   to ide_driver_t, which is filled in with necessary fields when an ide
   driver calls ide_register_driver(). That then registers the driver with
   the driver model core. 
     
   As a result, this gives us the following output in driverfs:
     
   # tree -d /sys/bus/ide/drivers/
   /sys/bus/ide/drivers/
   |-- ide-cdrom
   `-- ide-disk
     
   The suspend/resume callbacks in ide-disk.c have been temporarily
   disabled until the ide core implements generic methods which forward
   the calls to the drive drivers. 
<mochel@osdl.org> (02/10/09 1.727)
   IDE: add struct device to ide_drive_t and use that for IDE drives
   
   ... instead of the one in struct gendisk.
