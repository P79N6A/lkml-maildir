Ok, please write that as a comment into the source.

Can't be very many because oprofile needs it and it works on most archs now.
Anyways, the right thing is to just add it to the architectures
that still miss it, not reimplement it in kgdb.

Hmm, I'm pretty sure I saw some code that was only useful for the
user case. Perhaps you should take all that out then if it doesn't
work anyways?
a good example is all the code trying to handle user mode mappings.

Seems wrong intended behaviour to me. If kgdb is active it should have priority
over crash dumps.

The question is less about actually having it as a module, but 
just if the interfaces are clean enough to allow it as a module.
If not you should probably clean them up.

If all code is correct, it likely won't need a debugger.
But if you write a debugger you can't assume that.

Ok it just makes kgdb useless for a wide range of kernel problems.
Hung CPUs are not that uncommon in my experience.

If the return value of read() is wrong not even cat(1) will work
correctly, but lose bytes.
You're saying cat is not supposed to work on /proc? That's certainly
not my experience from many years of successfull cat /proc/... use.

Sure a lot of ugly code works in practice. If it's clean and maintaintable 
code is another question of course.
