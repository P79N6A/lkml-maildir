Do you mean 'size' (the size of alloc'ed buffer) is redundant or 'len' 
(the amount of data in the FIFO) is redundant ? I see how 'len' could
be removed (and didn't do it in the first place because I choosed
code simplification over a 4 bytes gain in storage), but I hardly
see how 'size' could be removed...

Like in __kfifo_get which doesn't lock and kfifo_get which does ?
I don't want to remove it completly since the whole point of this 
spinlock is to protect the fifo contents...

Oops. I will post an updated patch later today.
Thanks for the feedback.
