I've no idea why any drivers do this. A tty_wakeup is very fast and it
won't (when called from an IRQ) reschedule anything until the IRQ is over
(in the RT kernel case it might do stuff but thats *because* it should do
so).
I think just using tty_wakeup for this ought to be sufficient unless they
are using the work queue for some kind of serialization of events
