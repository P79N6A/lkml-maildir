Duh.  i386 needs to export efi_enabled.  ia64 doesn't as it's a
#define in linux/efi.h.  Matt T, are you working on EFI for x86_64
too?  Patch below for i386.

Export efi_enabled to modules such as efivars.  Only needed on i386 at
present, as ia64 has this as a #define in linux/efi.h, and EFI isn't
available for other arches.
