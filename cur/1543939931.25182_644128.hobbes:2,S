Subject: lib/idr.c: initialize struct idr_layer

Hi,
I am testing my kmemcheck patches, and it has come up with a couple of
uses of uninitialized memory in lib/idr.c. These are (the line numbers
may differ slightly):
line 135 (sub_alloc): bm = ~p->bitmap;
p->bitmap is uninitialized
line 171 (sub_alloc): if (!p->ary[m]) {
p->ary is uninitialized
line 249 (idr_get_new_above_int): pa[0]->count++;
pa[0]->count is uninitialized
I cannot guarantee that these are truly errors, but I would be
grateful if you could help me confirm/deny the validity of the
reports. Personally, I can get rid of the errors using this patch:
diff --git a/lib/idr.c b/lib/idr.c

Thanks a lot.
