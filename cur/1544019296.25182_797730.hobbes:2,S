Documentation/stable_kernel_rules.txt states that:
 - It must fix a real bug that bothers people (not a, "This could be a
   problem..." type thing).
The bug has been there for a very long time and hasn't generated any bug
reports so I think I'll just push it to mainline and leave it that. 
Thanks!
