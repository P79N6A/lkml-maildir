Subject: [patch] sleep_on() done with cli(), NetROM, 2.2.2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

and theres one place in the NetROM code. My fix only removes the lockup
but i think there is still a race there.
the conceptual problem is this: the code relies on the global IRQ lock to
keep asynchron events from happening. But we must not hold the tasklist
lock inside of the IRQ lock. I can see no good way to make sleep_on*() 
'just work' with the old assumptions... I guess that part has to be
rewritten to: add to the runqueue and lose TASK_RUNNING state, _then_
check the condition (atomically) and go sleeping if condition is not yet
ready.
