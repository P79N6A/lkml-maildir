My inclination would be to have the sysfs interface know generic terms,
with the implementation mapping them to device-specific terms. It ought
to be possible to build portable tools that don't have to know about
device-specific states and have the device interfaces (in sysfs) do the
necessary translation.
However, I also think there is value in having the sysfs interface
recognize the device-specific values as well, so that device-specific
tools can also be written (offering the option of taking advantage of
special capabilities of a particular device).
