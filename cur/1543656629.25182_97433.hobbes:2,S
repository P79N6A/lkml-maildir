NO.
The current code in 2.5.x is perfectly able to be 100% compatible with 
binaries even on old kernels. This whole discussion is _totally_ 
pointless. I solved all the glibc problems early on, and Uli is already 
happy with the interfaces, and they work fine for old kernels that don't 
have a clue about the new system call interfaces.
WITHOUT any new magic system calls.
WITHOUT any stupid SIGSEGV tricks.
WITHOUT and silly mmap()'s on magic files.

For _zero_ gain.  The jump to the library address has to be indirect 
anyway, and glibc has several places to put the information without any 
mmap's or anything like that.
