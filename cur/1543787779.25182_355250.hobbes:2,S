 most of the relevant work has already been done (and not by
 me): i invite you to consider searching with google for l4ka,
 l4linux and oskit, or simply going to the web site l4linux.org
 and l4ka.org.
 the code for oskit has been available for some years, now,
 and is regularly maintained.  the l4linux people have had to
 make some significant modifications to it (oskit), and also
 to grub, and libstdc++, and pretty much everything else under
 the sun and, it's all there, for the approx 100mb downloading.
