/* Acquire the smp_call_function_data mutex.  */
if (pointer_lock(&smp_call_function_data, &data, retry))
	return -EBUSY;
say we remove the pointer lock there and do a single atomic assignment
...
if (atomic_read(&data.unstarted_count) > 0) {
	...
}
we got at least one IPI 
/* We either got one or timed out -- clear the lock. */
mb();
smp_call_function_data = 0;
We clear smp_call_function_data
...
cpuX receives the IPI
case IPI_CALL_FUNC:
{
	struct smp_call_struct *data;
	void (*func)(void *info);
	void *info;
	int wait;
	data = smp_call_function_data;
	func = data->func;
	info = data->info;
...
Assigns whatever the pointer happens to be at the time, be it NULL or the 
next incoming message call.
Therefore we'd need a lock to protect both the variable and critical 
section.

I have to agree there, it would save on locked operations per 
'acquisition' which can be a win on a lot of systems.
