Pardon my insolence, but perhaps someone could enlighten me as to what
this has to do with compiling?  From what I could read in the original
message, and from what 'Search' told me, 'compile' was not mentioned
once in the message.
Whether or not the speed test was meaningful, I don't know, not having
used HINT.  But tests like this certainly remind us of, if not shed new
light on, possible problems that could be addressed.  Especially if the
benchmarks were run with a credible benchmarks package.
But I digress.  How did we come up with compile out of his message?
