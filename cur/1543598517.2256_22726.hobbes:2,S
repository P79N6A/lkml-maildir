    Thats wrong by the spec. I dug out my docs - there is a required 1mS (not
    2 tho) delay for keyboard port accesses.
Since there are various keyboard and mouse paths that can lead to
register access, it seems that we must either prefix each access
by a wait, or otherwise we must remember at what time we last did
a read.
Something else is that on some ancient (MCA) systems a delay is required
between finding the ready bit and actually reading the data
(Frank van Gilluwe, p. 273: wait 7 us).
On the other hand, 1 ms is a very long time these days; it is a bit
surprising that modern hardware should need delays in that order of
magnitude; maybe the problem is elsewhere and the mdelay(2) happens
to change the timing and avoid the problem.
