While trying to reproduce mounting of reiserfs FS over NFS from 2.5.59 server,
trying to see if there is something to do with reiserfs itself (and it worked
perfectly with 2.4.19 client), I decided to try to mount it from this same
workstation as I did not had 2.5.59 client at hand.
This way I learned that mount localhost:/exportedfs /mnt -t nfs
(localhost can be replaced by any local IP) results in mount
hanging in D state:
100     0   775   770  15   0  1532  620 rpc_ex D    pts/1      0:00 mount 212.16.7.78:/home /mnt -t nfs
At the same time I still can mount it from external hosts (but cannot kill this hung mount, obviously).
This is on today's 2.5.529 bk snapshot.
Bye,
    Oleg
