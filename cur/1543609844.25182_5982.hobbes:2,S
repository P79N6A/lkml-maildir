I few days ago I downloded the new kernel 2.2.20 and tried it out. After
the usual configuration process I find out that the nfsd module was not
mapped in the
kernel ( symbol not found, like the module was not configured, but it
was of course)
I tried to built it into the kernel istead of a module, same problem
with a message like "nfsd not supported"
I checked the options between my previous 2.2.18 and the new 2.2.20 I
had the same options for the compilations compilation
Is somebody find out similar problem ?
I am not in the mailing list plese send a e-mail to mail email
Thanks
Alfredo
