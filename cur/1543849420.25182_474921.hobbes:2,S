Thank you for the comment!
I'm not sure we should do it. If we move the code in fs/quota.c for example,
than this code will be compiled for _all_ arhitectures, not only for x86_64 and ia64.
Of course, we can surround this code by #ifdefs <ARCH>, but I thought this is 
a bad style... Moreover looking through current kernel code, I found out that
usually code is duplicated in such cases.
However, if you insist I'll modify the code! :)
Thank you.
