I am experiencing the same messages, in my case it is "Trying to free free
IRQ 4", which is used by my mouse with gpm.
I traced the line to arch/i386/kernel/irq.c, function free_irq().
It looks like the behavior in 2.3.11 was to:
                 spin_unlock_irqrestore(&irq_controller_lock,flags);
/* Wait to make sure it's not being used on another CPU */
                while (irq_desc[irq].status & IRQ_INPROGRESS)
                        barrier();
                kfree(action);
                return;
        }
        printk("Trying to free free IRQ%d\n",irq);
        spin_unlock_irqrestore(&irq_controller_lock,flags);
}
2.3.14, on the other hand, has simply:
        printk("Trying to free free IRQ%d\n",irq);
        spin_unlock_irqrestore(&irq_controller_lock,flags);
}
I haven't the level of understanding to resolve this, but perhaps this can
help someone out there.
