Just an extra thought: the current drivers directory is a mix of bus related
(pci, usb), /dev/* (char, block, ...) related and functionality related 
(bluetooth, cdrom, hwmon, watchdog, ...) items. Since our device drivers are
gradually moving to the new driver structure (with sysfs support) where
everything is bus related we will probably need to think how we best manage
this towards the user that will compile his kernel. (For instance: the 
watchdog usb driver depend on USB but USB is only later selectable if you do
a make config...)
Perhaps we will have in the future a drivers directory that is even oriented
towards the different busses (pci, usb, platform, isa, eisa, sbus, ...)
Greetings,
Wim.
