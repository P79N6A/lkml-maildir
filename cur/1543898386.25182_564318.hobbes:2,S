I don't know if this qualifies as an input for the output, but
I use a script to parse the results file to compute a gross/overall
"SCORE" value.  Instead of looking at lines that contain
"termination_id" (e.g.:
duration=0 termination_type=exited termination_id=0 corefile=no
), I look at the test results output format messages and count
them (ignoring the INFO lines) and then compute a SCORE based on
all of those lines.  Obviously that's why I've been changing several
test cases to use the standard test results output format.
ltprun-summary.sh is attached.  It uses prtag2tag.pl, which is also
attached.  (I also do this summary SCORE for the Open Posix Test suite.)
Example summary + SCORE:
Using logfile=/cruc/runs/1789/test_output/ltp.log
build errors:  0 lines
PASS:          2225
WARNing:       1
BROKen:        1
RETiRed:       0
FAIL:          0
CONFig error:  11
SCORE.ltp:        99.5
