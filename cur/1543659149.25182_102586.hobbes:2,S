It seems it lacks the code to actually blast the cmd byte passed
as a parameter...
Also, how are we supposed to use it exactly ? We shall fill the taskfile
first I beleive, so I suppose we shall call ide_spin_wait_hwgroup()
first which gets us a channel locked and not busy, right ?
That would do something like:
  if (ide_spin_wait_hwgroup(drive))
	return -EBUSY;
  hwgroup->busy = 1;
  .. put stuffs in taskfile regs ..
  spin_unlock_irq(&io_request_lock);
  ide_execute_command(drive, ...)
  
Ànd then hopefully wait (wait_for_completion() ?) for some action by
the expiry or the handler, right ?
I'm just trying to make sure I understand the purpose of this new function...
Ben.
