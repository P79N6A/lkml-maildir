Okay, I don't have an x86_64, sparc64 or something similar, as my 
computer is an x86, so I can't contradict this. If everything is fine on 
such arches, no fix is needed when nothing's broken... though I still 
think it's kind of ugly (though it's somehow ingenious as a hack) :)
Do you want me to resubmit the patch without these changes? I'll be back 
in a few hours (got to go now) and trim this out from the patch if 
that's necessary.
