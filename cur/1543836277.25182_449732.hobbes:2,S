num_physpages would still not give the right total number of pages in the
system. It will report a value smaller than the size of all memories which can
be suprising, depending on how it is used. In my mind I thought that it should
store the number of all pages in the system (reserved + free + ...).
Futhermore for flatmem model, my example that count the number of physical
pages is valid: reserved pages are really pages that are in used by the kernel.
But it's not valid anymore for sparsemem model. For consistency and code
sharing, I would make the same meaning of pfn_valid() and PageReserved() for
both models.
