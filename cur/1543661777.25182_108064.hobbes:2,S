Come on, quit whining already. When I started out fooling around with egcs
and the kernel, it took 45 to 60 minutes to build a kernel for me. And the
kernel was a lot smaller, and the compiler much faster.

Pour manpower and people who _know_ that _one_ CPU you are targeting in and
out into the project, it sure will get further along...

Sorry, can pick just one. Either you compile very fast (because you don't
analyze the code you are compiling very much, i.e., generate lousy code) or
generate excelent code (that requires complex analysis, large data
structures to build and use, and takes time).

"Easier and quicker" as in 5 or 6 years of hard work. Sure enough, come
back when you're done.
