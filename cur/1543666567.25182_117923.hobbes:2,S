Either it is a bk clone of some sort (which adds little value, and probably
won't get the head hackers to switch) or it works on different principles.
In the first case the info you request might be useful to peek at (but
Larry (quite understandably IMVHO) will veto that), but you won't need it
for day-to-day LKML bussiness; or it is utterly useless because it is from
an incompatible worldview.
