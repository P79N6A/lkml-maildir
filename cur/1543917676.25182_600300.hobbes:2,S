 I can add another data point 2.6.23-rc8-cfs-v22-g1bef7dc0-dirty does not have
 any problem with wine or xscreensaver is working fine. Again i use nvidia and
 a 3 party gpl driver for my wifi rt2500 which have compiled fine with the new
 kernel (surprise surprise!)
 If you need any more info just ask.
 Thanks
 P.S: I use ubuntu feisty fwiw
