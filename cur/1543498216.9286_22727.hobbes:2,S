Hmm.. it should be possible to write a decent benchmark...
Basically, you'd want to have a machine (or a set of machines, if one
machine wouldn't be up to it) which takes over a whole range of addresses
(maybe the 10.*.*.* bogusnet) and did things on a packet-at-a-time basis.
You'd probably want to rip the tcp code out of the kernel and bring it
into user space where you could mutilate it.
You'd probably want something reasonably decent for your top level,
so you could change what's being accessed, and how.
However, I'm not enough of a web performance guru to suggest lotsa
details.
