Unfortunately an application has no control over allocation of its
pages, so this basically makes raw IO useless right now with BIGMEM.
What I plan to do is to allow ll_rw_block to support bounce-buffers
transparently for devices which cannot safely access the high memory
locations, but at the same time to let devices tell the kernel when it
is safe to do the IO directly.  We _have_ to have bounce buffers of some
description.  Our only choice is whether we do it separately in the raw
code and the swapper (and later on in the page cache when we allow that
into high memory) or do it, once, in ll_rw_block.

It just harms applications. :(

Exactly why it needs to be per-device.  Once the high memory limit is
raised above 4G, this will become even more important as not all devices
will physically be able to support 64-bit PCI addressing.
