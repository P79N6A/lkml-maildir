"NETIF_MSG_" is silly and should be eliminated.
A separate "NETIF_MSG_ALL" test is not needed, because msg_enable is a 
bitmask.  A msg_enable of 0xffffffff will naturally create a NETIF_MSG_ALL.
Also, whatever mechanism is created, it needs to preserve the feature of 
the existing system:
	if (a quick bitmask test)
		do something
And preferably "do something" is not inlined, because printk'ing -- 
although it may appear in a fast path during debugging -- cannot be 
considered a fast path itself.
