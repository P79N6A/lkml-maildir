Hi Henrique,
The driver should send all characters with parity errors to the line
discipline marked with TTY_PARITY. The driver is supposed to handle the
hardware. The line discipline is supposed to handle any higher level
protocol. Ideally, the driver should not know or care about the state of
flags like IGNPAR, that are not needed to configure the hardware. 
Two common exceptions are:
1. "smart" UART hardware that directly handles some of the higher level
protocol, so the driver needs to know the higher level settings so it can
configure the hardware properly.
2. defensive actions to avoid bogging down the whole system with interrupt
storms from noisy or unconnected modem status inputs, where the driver could
mask off interrupts on modem status when the higher level options dictate
that all such status will be ignored.
Cheers,
Ed
