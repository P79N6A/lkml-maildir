You miss the point.
The RTC stores the CMOS time in MM DD YY HH:MM:SS format. That conversion
is done kernel side when reading/writing the RTC chip. Thus if you are
using leap second timing your BIOS RTC values will not agree with the
expected value.

There never has been any. Its all handled (both posix and sane) by glibc.
