Each of these options is flawed:
1&2) you have to do this for all processes
3) you can't handle a signal caused by stack exhaustion
4) deadlock.

That was 4 null options. I'd settle for one that could be shown to
work, or at least reasonably expected to.

Because there isn't always syscall interface for getting memory.
Look, I think it would be nice you you could provably ensure that
processes can be made safe from OOM. Some people will like that. But
until a lightweight, effective scheme is proposed that can support it,
I think we should steer clear of ad-hoc solutions that only give half
guarantees. It's better not to claim something at all than claim it
and people find out later it's not true.
