I think the key idea here is that a "server" spends most of its time
talking to other computers, and various perpipherals, while a
"workstation" spends most of its time talking to humans. (Both can be
high-bandwidth, high-computation tasks, these days.) 
Unfortunately, any long term difference between the two seems to be
minimal -- as Microsoft demonstrates quite nicely by shipping NT
"workstation" and NT "server", which are identical except for some tuning
parameters and the bundled doodads and daemons.
