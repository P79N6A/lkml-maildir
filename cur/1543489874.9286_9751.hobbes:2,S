i think it is more correct to define this a bug and print out a warning if
a too long delay happens. (patch against 2.2.3 attached) It's also a much
shorter and less intrusive patch. (it actually removes 13 lines) The
patch: 
  - prints a warning if a too long delay happens, eg.:
	bug: 000000001809cc03 cycles timer IRQ delay from c0107413
    (the above message was triggered artificially) The EIP is
    probably from the place where the long delay happened, but not
    necessarily. It's at least a starting point. IRQ0 has the highest
    priority, so we very likely will see some 'near' EIP.
  - moves get_8254_timer_count() into irq.h, thus we have one unified way
    of querying the timer counter.
  - fixes APIC calibration so that it doesnt cause excessive delays. (the
    patch popped up this one ;)
instead of silently 'fixing up' long delays, we should rather fix the
delays, not the effect. Also, a buggy TSC might cause 'delays', so we
definitely want something in the syslog.
(Buddha, Colin, does this patch detect your timer problems?)
