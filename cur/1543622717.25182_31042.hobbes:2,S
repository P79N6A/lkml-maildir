I think the last tests I was doing was on a 12cpu box, which
gave me about a 40% performance degredation by installing rmap.
Most people won't be interested in anything near that large,
but as Rik said, the problems will start on much smaller systems.
One of the nice things about running really large systems is
that they show up scalability problems and race conditions
really quickly and obviously ;-)
If someone has data for 4 or 8 way systems, I'd love to see it.
Else I'll get some myself in a little while.
Thanks,
Martin.
