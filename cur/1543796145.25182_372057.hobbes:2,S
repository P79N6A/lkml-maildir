As noted in my comparison of last week (you're still ignoring that):
 - Mine lets board-specific device tables be declared in the
   relevant arch_setup() thing (board-*.c).  Both frameworks allow
   later board specific code to dynamically declare the devices,
   with binary (Dave's) or parsed-text (Dmitry's) descriptions. 
What Mark said was that in this case he used the "late" init.  You seem
to be saying he's not allowed to do that.  Which is nonsense; there are
distinct mechanisms for the good reason that "late" init doesn't work
so well without dynamic discovery ... which SPI itself doesn't support.
Hence the need for board-specific "this hardware exists" tables.

Which, as has been pointed out, would be a trivial thing to fix
if anyone were actually to have a problem.  Sure it'd incur the
cost of a kmalloc on at least some paths -- serializing in the
slab layer instead! -- but that's one price of using convenience
helpers not performance oriented calls.

That characteristic being inherited from semaphores (or were they
updated with RT_PREEMPT?), and being in common with most I/O queues
in the system.  Not something to blame on any line of code I wrote.
Oh, and I noticed a priority inversion in your API which shows
up with one SPI controller managing two devices.  Whoops!  I'd
far rather have such inversions be implementation artifacts; it's
easy to patch an implementation, hard to change all API users.

One that every driver pays the price for.  Allocating a task even
when it doesn't need it; every call going through a midlayer that
wants to take over queue management policy; and more.  (Unless you
made a big un-remarked change in a patch you called "refresh"...)

So you think it's better to have consistent semantics be optional?
That seems to be the notion behind your spi_transfer() call, which
can't decide whether it's going to be synchronous or asynchronous.
Instead, it decided to be error prone and be both.  :)
> - the need to implement policy in controller driver
The "policy" in question is something that sometimes needs to
be board-specific -- priority to THAT device, synch with THIS
external signal, etc -- which is why I see it as a drawback
that you insist the core implement one policy.
One policy is painfully easy to implement:  FIFO, processing
the requests in the order they arrive.  Easy to implement,
even with spinlocks, in a dozen lines of code.  If anyone
has a hard time writing that, they shouldn't be trying to
write a device driver.
