In the cases where it's critical, we have realtime.  In the cases where it's 
important, this implementation won't keep latency low enough to make people 
happier.  If you've got a test case to prove me wrong, I'd like to see it.

A conventional server receives client requests, does a brief amount of work, and 
then gives a response.  This patch doesn't help that workload.  This patch helps 
the case where you've got batch jobs running on a slightly overloaded compute 
server, and unfairness means you end up waiting for a couple threads to finish 
at the end while CPUs sit idle.  I don't think it's that big of a problem, and 
if it is, I think we can solve it in a more elegant way than reintroducing 
expired queues.

Doesn't CFS already do this?

The thing that bugs me about this is the diminishing returns.  It looks like it 
will only give a substantial benefit when system load is somewhere between 1.0 
and 2.0.  On a heavily-loaded system, CFS will do the right thing within a good 
margin of error, and on an underloaded system, even a naive scheduler will do 
the right thing.  If you want to optimize smp fairness in this range, that's 
great, but there's probably a lighter-weight way to do it.

Task migrations don't bother me all that much.  Since we're migrating the 
*overload*, I expect those processes to be fairly cache-cold whenever we get 
around to them anyway.  It'd be nice to be SMT/multicore/NUMA-smart about the 
migrations, but that's an implementation detail.
The global lock is what really bothers me.  It's not just that it'll suck in 
certain rare cases (though I think it will), but it's really more the top-down 
design.  If we take a bottom-up approach, first keeping fairness between 
neighbors, it'll function identically on the low-end systems, but it'll be a 
huge win on the big systems, instead of a potential bottleneck.

The kernel should be tuned reasonably by default.  The days in which NUMA 
implied a supercomputer tuned by specialists are over.  NUMA is commodity now. 
As a simple heuristic, I suggest multiplying your default 
sysctl_base_round_slice by (log2(num_nodes)+1).  This scales the migration cost 
proportionally on most simple topologies.  People with gigantic torus-topology 
supercomputers who still bring in specialists to tune everything might still 
want to raise it.

The problem is that there are various reasons why a particular CPU might not get 
to execute this codepath for a little while, and then either your round 
invariant is broken, or you have a performance-killing barrier.  Relaxing your 
invariants and your locking would mitigate this.
Concerns aside, I agree that fairness is important, and I'd really like to see a 
test case that demonstrates the problem.
