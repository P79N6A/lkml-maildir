As far as the hardware is concerned there are two "multi-block" transfers:
 * Multiple, back-to-back blocks.
 * One or more blocks that need to be terminated by some form of stop
command.
The first can be identified by checking the number of blocks in the
request, the latter is harder to identify since it's a protocol semantic
(it could be just one block, but still need a stop). Does MMC_DATA_MULTI
indicate the latter, former or both?
