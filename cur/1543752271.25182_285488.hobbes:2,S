We can certainly go either way. I decided to go the way I did simply 
because that was what was suggested.

Also, Ben Herrenschmidt expressed a desire to use this interface in 
dealing with some power management issues on G5's. The issue is that 
when some devices are powered off on G5 they will not respond to config 
cycles and may even deadlock the system. This usage would require the 
ability to block userspace for an indefinite period of time and also 
make use of the config space caching code that is in my patch.
