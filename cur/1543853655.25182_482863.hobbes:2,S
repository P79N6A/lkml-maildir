Hi,
This patch adds support for the latest Chelsio adapter, T3.
Since some files are bigger than the 40kB advertized in the submit
guidelines, a monolithic patch against 2.6.19-rc5 is posted at the
following URL: 
http://service.chelsio.com/kernel.org/cxgb3.patch.bz2
Please advise on any other form you would like to see the code.
We wish this patch to be considered for inclusion in 2.6.20. This driver
will be required by the Chelsio T3 RDMA driver which will be posted for
review asap.
Cheers,
Divy
