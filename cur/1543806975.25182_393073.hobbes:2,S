How is this possible?  A normal user can't produce arbitarily formatted
kernel messages, and if they have access to /dev/ttyS they can do what
ever they like with the port anyway.
(If a user can produce arbitarily formatted kernel messages, that in
itself is a security bug - how do you know if that OOPS was produced
by a malicious user, or a real oops?)

You'd rather we threw away these messages?

It'd help if you talked to the right person - I've been looking after
the serial layer since 2.5.something.
