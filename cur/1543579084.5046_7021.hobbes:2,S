Hello Linux VM God :)
I think I started seeing this about 2.4.0-ac6...when I shutdown my
machine, I see tons of 'VM: Undead swap entry #######', where ####### is
some memory address.  I can also reproduce this 100% by (for
example) going into X, loading a lot of crap so that my 112mb ram is full
and it starts to swap, then get out of X, and do a 'swapoff -a'. 
Is this just debugging info, or would you like to see the output of it? My
machine is currently a Debian Unstable, with 112mb RAM and about 190mb
swap, running 2.4.0-ac8.
I have the following kernels installed, so if you need me to see exactly
which kernel started this, it'll be easy:
toy:/etc# grep label /etc/lilo.conf
  label = 240ac8
  label = 240ac7
#  label = 240ac6
#  label = 240ac2
#  label = 240prac6
#  label = 240prac4
#  label = 240t13p7
#  label = 240t12
#  label = 240t12p6
#  label = 240t12p5
#  label = 240t12p3
#  label = 240t12p2
#  label = 240t11
#  label = 240t11p7
  label = k2218p15
  label = win98
