Yes indeed.  There aren't many bits to play with in an ext2 inode so you
have to be careful, but it can be done.  Especially when you combine it
with the timestamp (there's no need to update a revision number if the
time changes).  I think this can even run over NFS (as a dubious
extension in the cookie or something ;-)

AFS does something like that.  ntpd is better :-)
