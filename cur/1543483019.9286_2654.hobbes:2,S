Last I looked (Solaris 2.5.1), they used a rather neat STREAMS interface
for syslogd.  Well, as neat as a STREAMS interface could be.  It supported
multiple simultaneous readers, at least - somewhere I should have some code
to talk to it, written while seriously contemplating porting Linux's
syslogd to Solaris. ;)  (We had a daemon that generated voluminous output
via syslogd, and Solaris' syslogd didn't have the "no sync" option.)
