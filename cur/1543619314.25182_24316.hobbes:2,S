I did, but I thought it was a TCP option, not a socket option.
I will change it and see if it does anything. Currently, it
seems like a no-op, no errors, but does nothing. 
Early in code:
int on = 1;
#define ON &on
Where accept is called. Returned socket value is set to nodelay. 
        len = sizeof(addr);
        if((hs = accept(s, SSAP &addr, &len))) == FAIL)
            ERRORS(Accept);
        if(setsockopt(hs, IPPROTO_TCP, TCP_NODELAY, ON, sizeof(on)) == FAIL)
            ERRORS(Setsockopt);
So, maybe it's supposed to be SOL_TCP?  I'll look for it.
