I think "because" instead of "due" is closer to standard English.

Similarly should be "many" instead of "much".

You usually can handle idr_get_new() returning -EAGAIN by jumping back
to the idr_pre_get(), to handle someone else coming in and stealing
the memory you just preallocated.  In this case it may not matter
since it's pretty unlikely that a lot of contexts are using the idr at
the same time.  But anyway...

This reference counting looks dubious to me... later on in the code
you have:
 > +static int pps_cdev_open(struct inode *inode, struct file *file)

 > +

 > +	atomic_inc(&pps->usage);
with no locking, so I see no reason why the atomic_inc() couldn't
happen right after the wait_event() sees a count of 0 and lets the
deregistration continue.  Which would lead to use-after-free.
