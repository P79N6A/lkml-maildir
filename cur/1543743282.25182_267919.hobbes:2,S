it might, i'm going to check soon
what worries me is that two very different code paths might be fixing
the same problem which makes me think the flow of execution here is
very vague and needs cleaninng up
also, check your return values for errors --- i bet you will see
some.  os_kill_process has this problem too --- many invocations of it
are pointless and fail, especially those from relase_thread_tt (i need
to check the details here, this is all from memory and im getting old)

it should build pretty close to as-is, if not let me know and i'll
sent you what i have
