I didn't say that. I'm talking about what's common in embedded systems
and it is _very_ common for an embedded system to be small both in
mechanical dimension and computational horsepower. This is not a
misconception but simply practical experience.

Sure these systems exist, but trust me, they are a very small fraction
of a very big market.

How about this: An embedded system is a computer system designed to
fulfill a particular purpose.
Since embedded systems are usually made in large quantities, there is a
strong pressure to make them as cheap as possible. Thus, the amount
of resources assigned to a system is usually just barely enough for
it to fulfill it's purpose. If it has gigs of RAM, you can be sure it
needs every bit of it for doing whatever it is supposed to do.
Running on low resources is symptomatic to all embedded systems.
