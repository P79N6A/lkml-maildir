if you enabled it before getting the new oopses what's interesting is
that you send me a tarball of /var/log/ksymoops, so I
will also be able to resolve those module addresses too (please send me
also your agpgart.o and your radeon.o modules, all from the same
kernels: .o, ksymoops and below oopses).
thanks,
Andrea
