I regurlarly burn CD-R with ide-scsi on 2.4, and I've not noticed any
problems (this is on two different atapi writers). This could be an
ide-scsi bug on some models. The folks who are seeing corruption, could
they try and narrow it down? Is it random data getting written, or
data from other locations?
