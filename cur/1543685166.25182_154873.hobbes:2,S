Hi,
I searched network to find some documents about agp driver but I can't find
any. I am very greatful if anyone can tell me where I can get agp driver's
documents, especially developer's guide on how to implement a special agp
dirver.
And I notice that the function agp_register_driver is no longer exist in
kernel 2.5.70, but it exists in kernel 2.5.64 or later. I am wonder how to
register a agp driver in in kernel 2.5.70.
Thanks a lot!
Wu Hao
