Well, that of course an entirely different (and I might call it special)
condition. 
In theory you could still write anonymous pages to swap device, and then
have the swap disk spun down/go to powersave state. The swap space is still
in use, but you take the "do not spin up/use the disk, please" requirement
in consideration by not dropping the swap-backed in-memory pages. Once the
swap disk is spun up, you restore the normal operating mode and take
advantage of the still swap-backed anonymous pages (provided of course they
haven't been dirtied in between).
That of course is only theoretical speculation. Surely no os goes that far.
I understand linux even hasn't a mechanism to avoid swapping when power
needs to be saved?
