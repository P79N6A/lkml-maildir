Ok.  I thought it might be, but I wasn't sure.  
(I was able to imagine a way it might work
and not be a leak, as bdget appears to search through a list and only
alloc if it doesn't find it already there.)  But I don't have
anything like a complete understanding of bdget(), to state the
obvious.

Hmm. It worked when I tried it (apart from the leak).  
Maybe the disk was already open.  The situation was that the
disk is there, (will respond to inquiry) but is reserved by
another host so read capacity will fail.  Maybe I was just
(un)lucky.  Anyway, I think you're saying there are situations
that I didn't try that don't work.  Ok, forget this patch.

I haven't looked into driverfs too much yet.  (too much time
spent keeping up with the latest redhat/suse kernel, etc.)
Is there anything written up about it to help out driver
writers?  I'm not much looking forward to telling our ACU
and CIM guys they need to change all their apps to use
driverfs interfaces.  Also, I'm hoping driverfs is better
than /proc, in the sense that /proc tends to be read-only,
or write-only, unlike ioctl() where you can put in a complex 
input and get back a corresponding output.  With the likes of
/proc, you can write something in there, but how do you get
back a corresponding output?  Read it?  Some other thread
can race you for it?  (And if you're talking about shell 
scripts using it, then processes could race.) 
An ioctl-ish interface is superior for some applications.  
(not that the one that this patch
lamely attempts to implement is necessarily such an application,
but the array config utility definitely is.)  Hopefully
driverfs provides that kind of interface.
