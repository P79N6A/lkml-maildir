Well, what you write is certainly not correct in Germany.
At least here in Germany, a licence is NOT a contract.
If you go into a shop and buy a cardboard box with a software CD in it, 
the only contract you have made is that contract with the shop
owner about purchasing this very box. The german law is very
explicit in stating that there is absolute NO contract with the producer
i.e., the software company which has the rights on the software.
And as a consequence, that funny microsoft eula is totally void,
even if you have clicked at "I agree". Never ever (at least in Germany)
constitutes the act of clicking this button a contract with the software
company. Because the law says that a contract is not valid without an 
agreement, and the law gives some requirements on the form of an agreement in
order to be valid, and "clicking somewhere" is not enough.
Of course, the user has to honor the general law which forbids copying and
distributing the software (except with permission from the creator).
