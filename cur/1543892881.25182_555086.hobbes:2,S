Let's be precise. If "keep the existing output" means any format change is
unacceptible to you, then I broke things. If it means that my method provides
data equivalent in respect of content, then I didn't break the lock contention
output.

We got to be careful here. My other proposal was doomed because timerstat became 
kernel ABI in the meantime. We won't break the kernel ABI. I was late, as simple 
as that.
The lock contention stuff isn't kernel ABI yet. This is -mm code, stuff
intented for a wider audience and discussion. It should be perfectly fine
to scrutinize kernel ABI additions before we get beyond the point of no return.

I don't see the point of judging something by goals that have not been set.
I have advertised my patches as: same purpose, different or generalised method,
differences in output format, output equivalent in respect of content,
much more code sharing.
