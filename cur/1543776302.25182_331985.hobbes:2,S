I don't think that swsusp can be replaced with suspend2 right now.  First,
swsusp works on x86-64, and the support in suspend2 is preliminary,
AFAIK.  Second, the IA64 support for swsusp is in the works, and it is not supported
by suspend2.
Please don't plan to drop swsusp until you are able to replace it _completely_.
Greets,
Rafael
