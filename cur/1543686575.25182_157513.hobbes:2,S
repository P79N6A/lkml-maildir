It was already posted to linux-fbdev-devel, but I haven't got any
comments...
Attached patch is rather simple and obvious.

Subject: [PATCH] tdfxfb: fix for background used in fbcon_clear
Hello,
This time I checked recent linux-fbdev-devel archives - and didn't see
any patch for this issue. So here is my fix.
There was wrong color used in fillrect in 16/24/32bpp (pseudo_palette
mapping was omitted), which resulted in ugly black (well, almost black)
rectangles painted when some "clear" terminal command was sent (like
"^[[J", "^[[K") with background colour different than black.
It was visible e.g. in mc's View.

This fixes background used for "clear" terminal commands (^[[J, ^[[K etc.)
in 16/24/32bpp modes.
