There is no official user level documentation for dmix (which runs in
userspace anyway), because it was not intended to be configured by the
end user.  The current ALSA version, 1.0.9-rcX, uses dmix by default.
It's always a pain to get OSS apps to play nice with dmix, which is why
the real solution is to get proper ALSA support in Skype.
