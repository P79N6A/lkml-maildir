I think the right approach is to not change driver_data but instead to
add a new version of pci_enable_device() (I call it
pci_enable_resources() but you are welcome to find something more fancy)
to enable a selected set of resources with the old pci_enable_device()
just calling the new one with a full mask set.
I don't like the driver_data approach. I don't like the static table
approach in fact. Drivers may "know" wether they need to enable/disable
given resources based on other things like revision, etc... Some drivers
may want to enable only one BAR, access some registers to properly
figure out what rev of a device they are talking to, then selectively
enable other BARs and/or MSIs etc...
I think the driver should be in control... flags in a static table
aren't flexible enough.
Ben.
