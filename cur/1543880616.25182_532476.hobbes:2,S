In this case, reiserfs is taking i_mutex to safely discard the
preallocation blocks.  The best solution would probably be to just put
in a preallocation mutex other than i_sem (even i_mmap would probably
work).
This shouldn't be a new regression, the file_release prelloc stuff
hasn't changed in ages.
