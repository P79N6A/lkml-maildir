40 is Received Illegal Vector
20 is Send Illegal Vector
60 means you're getting both errors at the same time.
Basically it means that the APIC bus messages are malformed.
The cause can be hardware or software, it's difficult to tell.
Try a different kernel, w/o ACPI (acpi=off), w/o ACPI PCI
routing (pci=noacpi), or w/o I/O-APIC (noapic).
