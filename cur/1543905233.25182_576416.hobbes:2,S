I am particularly bad at faith. Let's take that stupid program that I posted:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/25/85
You push it out before you hit enter, it's written out to swap, at whatever 
speed. How should it be layed out so that it's swapped in most efficiently 
after hitting enter? Reading bigger chunks would quite obviously help, but 
the layout?
The program is not a real-world issue and if you do not consider it a useful 
boundary condition either (okay I guess), how would log structured swap help 
if I just assume I have plenty of free swap to begin with?
Rene.
