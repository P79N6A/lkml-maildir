I don't have much comments left :)  What about moving the sector_t typedef
completly to <asm/types.h>?  Looks like the cleanest solution to me.
I also wonder whether CONFIG_LBD might want to move to arch/*/config.
An a little suggestion:  you could feed that patch to Linus in pieces.
The printk cleanups might be a good start.
