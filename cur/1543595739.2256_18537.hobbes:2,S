Yes, the only exception is that write_inode needs to honor the sync flag,
at least when not called under PF_MEMALLOC.  The biggest reason I can find
so far is knfsd, who calls write_inode_now and expects the inode to be
securely on disk.  It doesn't call mark_inode_dirty directly, it calls some
FS func (link, create, whatever) and then uses write_inode_now to commit.

I haven't seen any problems caused by it yet, but that might be because
reiserfs does all the important inode writes on its own.  I believe
generic_commit_write is the only place outside the FS that calls
mark_inode_dirty with something other than an atime update.
