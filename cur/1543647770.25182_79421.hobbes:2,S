I guess it boils down to differentiation between architectural flaws
and more trivial code cleanup. I guess the thing that drew me to Christoph's
particular criticism was whether or not it is a flaw or a feature for
remapping layers to just be remapping layers and not also block devices.
If it is the concensus that remapping layers should also be block devices
then i concede. Although clearly there needs to be a little more reason
than having a device node to do an ioctl on.

Okay. It's just not clear which criticism are of the trival post merge
code cleanup kind, which are true architectural problems, and which are
singly held opinions on architectural requirements.
Can we have some concensus on whether intermediate remapping layers also need
to be exposed as block devices as this requiement would have a large impact
on the code.
 From the discussion so far:
Pros
* Simplify ioctl routing to plugins
Cons
* Chew up a minor
* Get a block device we don't need or want (ie. we can still easily
   directly access the underlying physical block devices)
* loose purely logical remapping abstraction in plugins
* Complicate mapping of request queues to devices (ie. shouldn't only
   the top level volume device and the underlying physical devices need
   request queues)
