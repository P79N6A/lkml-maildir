Its 1000 lines. If it is not broken now, it will be broken in 2.8, and
because it is in mainline, it will be up to linus to fix it.
Oh and it is enough confusing that it confuses me. Some messages end
in dmesg, some do not. User feedback can be done with much less code,
and also slightly less confusing for the user, see swsusp1. [We have
to switch to another console, anyway; and printing dots is easy.]
Okay, we should probably make suspend more quiet, I can see users
badly confused by those hdX: spinning down (etc) messages.
Also, in your model, where do messages printk()-ed from drivers during
suspend/resume end up? Corrupting screen? Lost from sight and only
accessible from dmesg? I believe driver messages *are* important, and
do not see how they could coexist with eye-candy.
