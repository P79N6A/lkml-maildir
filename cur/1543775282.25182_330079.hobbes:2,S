I guess it would be enough to split a huge file into the same
size pieces simply and put each of them in its associated radix-tree
in most cases for practical use.
And I also feel your approach is interesting.

I see.
I propose another idea if you don't mind, seqlock seems to make
your code much simpler though I'm not sure whether it works well
under heavy load. It would become stable without the tricks,
which makes VM hard to be enhanced in the future.
Thanks,
Hirokazu Takahashi.
