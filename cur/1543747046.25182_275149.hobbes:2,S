Hi,
I recently got a Sharp MP70G with a 1.6 GHz efficeon processor 
and have some questions regarding longrun support. I am using 
longrun-0.9-15 and kernel 2.6.10-rc2.
In arch/i386/kernel/cpu/proc.c the kernel seems to check bit 3
for the lrti capability, longrun.c checks bit2. 
Are thermal extensions different on the efficeon compared to the crusoe?
No matter what I choose (between 0 and 7) the level field in the ATM
register is always 0. 
Are there any new efficeon features not yet supported in the kernel or
the longrun utility? Is there any register information available
anywhere? I looked on the transmeta pages but did not find anything
about this.
The BIOS also allows one to select C4 as possible power level,
/proc/acpi/processor/CPU0/power only offers C1, C2 and C3. 
I ask because under Windows, if nothing is running, the fan will
stay off. Under Linux it is turning on about every two minutes and
will then run for about a minute (also with everything turned off, and
about every daemon shut down).
Cheers,
Ralph Metzler
