That's odd. Netpoll holds a reference to the device, of course, but so
does a normal "up" interface. So that shouldn't be the problem.
Another possibility is that outgoing packets from printks in the
driver are causing difficulty. Not sure what can be done about that.

It's generally going to suck, because unlike a polled serial port, the
device needs to be put to sleep. But if you're doing suspend to RAM,
you might be able to do something like this:
- unhook net device from suspend machinery (possibly just return success)
- bounce out of suspend before the final call to ACPI is made
Net effect is you do OS-level suspend and resume of everything but the
NIC without actually powering down the core. Which should let you
debug just about everything.
