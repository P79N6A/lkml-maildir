For ehca we currently can't modify a large MR when it has been allocated.
EHCA Hardware expects the pages to be there (MRs must not have "holes").
This is also true for the global MR covering all kernel space.
Therefore we still need the memory to be "pinned" if ib_umem_get() is
called.
So with the current implementation we don't have much use for a notifier.
