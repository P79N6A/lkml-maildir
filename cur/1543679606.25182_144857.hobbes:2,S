this is true too. however get_unmapped_area never need to find a new
place for the granular usages since mmap is always called with MAP_FIXED for
those.

it can't be trivially a tree of free areas or (if naturally indexed with
the size of the hole) it would return the smallest-fitting hole, not the
leftmost-smallest-fitting-hole ;). A better solution is possible. Then
everybody will benefit w/o need of userspace changes. It's still pretty
orthogonal with remap_file_pages though.

mlock already does it too.

the major reason you didn't mention for remap_file_pages is the rmap
avoidance. There's no rmap backing the remap_file_pages regions, so the
overhead per task is reduced greatly and the box stops running oom
(actually deadlocking for mainline thanks to the oom killer and NOFAIL
default behaviour). since there's no rmap, this in turn means either
this nonlinear vma will swap badly, or it means rmap is totally useless
to swap well. Which in short means either rmap has to go in its current
form (and the usefulness of remap_file_pages would be greatly reduced),
or nonlinear mappings would better stay pinned in ram since they'd
better not be used for the emaulator with 63G of highmem into swap on a
1G host anyways (the sysctl would fix the security detail in pinning
into ram like we're doing today with the largepages in 2.4).
