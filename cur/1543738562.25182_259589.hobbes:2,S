Tony,
We came to a resolution on the pci_root-ops issue, Jesse is OK with the code, Jes and Christoph are 
fine with the qla mod. I've added a couple of fixes from us as well as removing a redundant check 
pointed out in the review - see the full list below. So the code is ready to go.
Can you take this now Tony ?
Thanks,
-- Pat
