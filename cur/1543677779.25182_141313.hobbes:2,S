Let me quickly amend that, the referenced message is also a VFS change,
but a worse one than proposed in this thread.  The reason I proposed to
do it in the VFS is that I couldn't get it to work in the NFS code.
After returning from nfs_rename(), I'd promptly get a null pointer deref.
Yes, I did want to suggest an NFS patch, but it became clear that after
the VFS calls ->rename, it expects things to happen which I didn't do.
More specifically, I avoided the 'if (!d_unhashed()) d_drop()' code, and
rather than figure out the requirements I simply figured I'd propose a
VFS change.  Simple just seemed good to me ... I don't think it's so
bad for the VFS to have *small* bits of fs-specific knowledge.  You could
call the flag (say) DCACHE_DONT_UNLINK if it makes it sound less specific.
