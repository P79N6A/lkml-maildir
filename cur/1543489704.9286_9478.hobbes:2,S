Wrong mailing list. That particular include file is part of libc, not of the
kernel. As a side note i dont understand how ANSI C++ can allow an implicit
conversion of a literal integer to a pointer to a struct, but not a void
pointer to a pointer to a struct. This also implies all code which should
return pointers and do 'return NULL;' are now to be considered broken (in
C++), which, quite frankly, scares me. Are you sure this is the problem ?
(Also, take a look at your libc, libc5/libc6/whatever, and bug its authors :-)
