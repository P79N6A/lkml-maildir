I'm glad we're on the same page now. :)  And yes, adding four "duplicate"
*_mempool allocators was not my first choice, but I couldn't easily see a
better way.

Hmmm...  I kinda like that.  Some sort of
struct allocation_policy
{
	enum       policy_type;
	nodemask_t nodes;
	mempool_t  critical_pool;
}
that could be passed to __alloc_pages()?
That seems a bit beyond the scope of what I'd hoped for this patch series,
but if an approach like this is believed to be generally useful, it's
something I'm more than willing to work on...
