Hi!
There was a problem that affected all tulip based drivers and which has been
fixed in most of them, for uli526x the problem remains on 2.6.25-rc2 as the
fix has not yet been applied.
A discusion of this bug and the patch to fix it is at
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5839
Several people including myself have tested the patch and have stated that
it works ok.
I would encourage people with the proper permissions to submit this patch so
that it ends up on 2.6.25.
Thanks in advance!
Regards...
