As of linux 2.6.8.1 the aic79xx driver included is version 1.3.11 which 
dates back to July 11, 2003.
On my Tyan B2881 the used scsi controller has a lot of problems: as soon 
as I try to transfer some data I get a frozen scsi subsystem and a dump 
in the syslog messages.
I hope to be able to solve these problems by using the new driver found 
at 
http://people.freebsd.org/~gibbs/linux/SRC/
My question is: why isn't the new version included in the main tree?
Thanks.
