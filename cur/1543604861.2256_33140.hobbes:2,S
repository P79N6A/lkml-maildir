	No, you can compile it as a module, you need to insert manually it
(modprobe) or better modify modules.conf so it gets inserted automatically
when loading i2c. The problem with the machine hanging up was resolved
as Dan Hollis suggested comenting the initialization routine (I mean
the content of the routine, the routine must exist).

	Uhmm, I don't know if reading the sensors in the BIOS would
make it work better, but I must make a sensors -s before reading, if not
I'll get that 70ºC ... the same that you get when you enter the BIOS
until you press a key.
	It's important to change the type of thermal sensor to
3904 transistor ( set sensor1 2 ....) if not you won't get the right
temperatures.
