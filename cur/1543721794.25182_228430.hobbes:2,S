Very good question, as these features/patches are often the ones that
are ugliest and the hardest to maintain. Or the ones that make you
slightly source incompatible with mainline, which is always ugly.

Within reason (I trust your taste and judgement completely), I fully
support that and think this is key to maintaing closer proximity between
mainline and vendor kernels. There are _always_ going to be uglies
(don't ask me why)...

Wish I had an answer for that. Things can and do get dropped from vendor
trees, doesn't cover all cases naturally.
