Hello Russell,

Well it's used in arch/mips/philips/... so I doubt it's a right thing
to move it to drivers/serial.
I'd rather put it into include/asm-mips/mach-pnx8550 but it's gonna be
shared between this and other similar SoCs (when/if they are submitted
into mainline) so I'm not sure about that either.

I guess it's include/asm-mips/arch-pnx8550/uart.h, but it is not
needed and will be removed in the next version :)

Oh, got it now, thanks.

I don't think you're right here - break condition is also disabled
unsetting the corresponding bit in  IEN register for this particular
UART.

I'll add it to the new version.
