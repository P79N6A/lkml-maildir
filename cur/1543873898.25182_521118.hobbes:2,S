Excellent work. Now suspend to disk is working again. But:
1.) The quirk added in commit a417a21e10831bca695b4ba9c74f4ddf5a95ac06
for the appletouch driver doesn't seem to work after resume.
2.) The first suspend to disk works with no problems, but the second
suspend to disk in a row results in an oops:
 ->resume_device ->
pci_device_resume->ata_host_resume->ahci_pci_device_resume->ata_pci_device_do_resume->pci_restore_state
