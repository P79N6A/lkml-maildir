Jeff,
I've seen word of a similar failure on VIA 8235, but on those I've got
neither the hardware nor the chipset documentation -- it would be great
if I could get this to fail on hardware I actually have...
BTW. The latest stuff in
http://linux-acpi.bkbits.net:8080/linux-acpi-2.4
 should be able to boot
with acpi=ht, or you can build with just CONFIG_ACPI_HT, and that will
give you HT without any other parts of ACPI.  Though if the platform has
no MPS, this option leaves the platform in XT-PIC mode since it doesn't
do IOAPIC discovery.
Feel free to dump the usual info into a kernel.org bug under
component=ACPI and assign it to me.
Thanks,
-Len
