Yeah, but that won't stop people from wanting it :-)

I can assure you that 2.2.15 works very nicely on an Athalon. I was
running it on our server when the 2.3.99 kernels had appalling VM
performance. Even MTRR support (the K7 has Intel-compatible MTRRs
while the K6 were AMD-specific; the K7 broke an assumption in the MTRR
driver which was later fixed in 2.2.x and 2.3.x kernels) works.
I think what Alan meant is that support for K7-specific features is
not available. So the kernel just treats it as a lowly PIII.
