Cute. The slow bit on FRV is any time you access the PSR register (read or
write). It seems to be something on the order of 60 clock cycles a pop - in
which time the CPU could have executed 120 instructions under ideal
circumstances.
I do something like this to implement "atomic" operations, playing on the
FRV's ability to pack two instructions atomically together and to have
conditionally executed instructions:
	Documentation/fujitsu/frv/atomic-ops.txt.
Trading off against the memory speed might just do it - though you have to do
a write and a read (the latter of which should hopefully be cached). I could
always steal another register (I have 31-ish to play with, plus a bunch of
single-bit condition values).
It'd make the exception prologue even more "interesting" though...:-)
Hmmm...
