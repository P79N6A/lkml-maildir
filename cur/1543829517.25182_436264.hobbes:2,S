I guess the BUG_ON makes more sense than keeping the
check, the reason coverity stumbled across this,
is the debug("get_attention_status - Exit rc[%d] value[%x]\n", rc,
*value); call some lines later, which uses the pointer.
If we just keep the check, we should also put one
around the debug statement
