New version of FAT patch is out there.
News:
	Aliases done. Now it passes the whole Gordon's testsuite except
one of the internationalization tests.
	change of ->lookup() type (binary compatible, see the
corresponding thread on linux-fsdevel) done.
TODO:
	UMSDOS integration.
	fat_get_entry() optimization (*badly* needed, since it's used more
active than in the vanilla kernel).
	fat_readdir_x() cleanup (related to previous).
	internationalization stuff.
	I consider that as early beta. You are warned - it seems to be
OK, but it needs testing. It still doesn't work with UMSDOS and is not too
kind wrt NFS exporting. Warning: MSDOS part got less testing than VFAT.
I.e. may be less stable.
	Patch lives on: 
ftp.math.psu.edu/pub/viro/fat-patch-9.gz	(incremental over rename-11)
ftp.math.psu.edu/pub/viro/rename+fat-patch-9.gz	(combined).
  	No changes in rename patch (submitted to Linus).
  							Cheers,
  								Al
