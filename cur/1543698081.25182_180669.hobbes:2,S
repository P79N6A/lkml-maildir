   Are you considering including libata support for 2.4.24?  From my 
testing with a number of different embedded sata chipsets (mostly ICH, 
SI, and Promise) it appears very stable.  I'm not seeing any data 
corruption or lockups when running Cerberus with 2.4.23-rc5 + libata 
patch.  The only troubles I've had were with initialization of embedded 
promise sata controllers. (I still need to test with Jeff's latest fixes 
for this.)
