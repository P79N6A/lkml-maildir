The problem comes in the first place from trying to avoid the extra
de-reference to get to the filesystem-specific data.  This was successfully
done, but at great expense in increased source code complexity and also
by sacrificing the idea that the vfs should be properly separated from the
filesystems it supports.  I'd like to suggest a relatively small change
that would still save the extra dereference, but without tangling the fs 
headers in knots.
What I was actually thinking of is adding a couple of extra integer fields 
onto the end of the file_system_type struct, giving the size of the 
filesystem-specific data required for the superblocks and inodes:
	struct file_system_type {
		const char *name;
		int fs_flags;
		struct super_block *(*read_super) (struct super_block *, void *, int);
		struct file_system_type * next;
+		int fs_specific_size_super;
+		int fs_specific_size_inode;
	};
For ext2, the file_system_type initializor would be:
	static struct file_system_type ext2_fs_type = {
		"ext2", 
		FS_REQUIRES_DEV /* | FS_IBASKET */,	/* ibaskets have unresolved bugs */
	        ext2_read_super, 
		NULL,
		sizeof(ext2_sb_info),
		sizeof(ext2_inode_info)
	};
Macro symbols would be substituted for the unions in fs.h:
	struct super_block {
		struct list_head	s_list;
		kdev_t			s_dev;
		...
		struct list_head	s_dirty;	/* dirty inodes */
		struct semaphore s_vfs_rename_sem;	/* Kludge */
		FS_SPECIFIC_SUPERBLOCK_INFO
	};
To compile ext2 fs you use the following defines before including fs.h:
	#define	FS_SPECIFIC_SUPER_INFO union {struct ext2_sb_info ext2_sb;} u;
	#define	FS_SPECIFIC_INODE_INFO union {struct ext2_inode_info ext2_i;} u;
All the changes required are trivial, both in the vfs code and in the specific
filesystems.  In fact, it would be easy to avoid changing the specific 
filesystems at all if that were desired, though I don't see why that would be 
good.
This strategy would allow all the file systems to compile properly, with only 
trivial changes, and it would allow the file system headers to be untangled a 
great deal.  Furthermore, each filesystem maintainer the choice of continuing 
to use the (awkward) sb->u.fs_specific_struct.actual_field syntax, or getting 
rid of it completely in the interest of improving the readability of the code.
Not only readability, but generality as well is being held back by the current
arrangement.
