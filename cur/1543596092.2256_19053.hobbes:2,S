Subject: Possible problem with IDE device driver in kernel.

I would like to report a bug that I've seen in a few linux kernels now. This 
may be a serious problem with the IDE controler software because it may cause 
a hard drive to ware out over a period of time. I've noticed for a long time 
that when linux is loaded the hard drive light on my computer goes on and 
stays on. It never turns off. If I boot with windows the light turns off. I 
think it may be the device driver that forgets to turn of the light. Could 
one of you please confirm if this is a problem with the kernel and get back 
to me if it is not. 
Thank you,
Philip V. Neves
