I think though, for fairness, if we allow one to submit a batch
of requests, we have to give that opportunity to the others.
And yeah, it does reduce context switches, and it does improve
throughput for "random" localised IO.

The read situation is different to write. To fill the read queue,
you need queue_nr_requests / 2-3 (for readahead) reading processes
to fill the queue, more if the reads are random.
If this kernel is being used interactively, its not our fault we
might not give quite as good interactive performance. I'm sure
the fileserver admin would rather take the tripled bandwidth ;)
That said, I think a lot of interactive programs will want to do
more than 1 request at a time anyway.

Yeah, I'm not talking about request overhead - I think a 128K sized
request is just fine. But when there are 256 threads writing, with
FIFO method, 128 threads will each have 1 request in the queue. If
they are sequential writers, each request will probably be 128K.
That isn't enough to get good disk bandwidth. The elevator _has_ to
make a suboptimal decision.
With batching, say 8 processes have 16 sequential requests on the
queue each. The elevator can make good choices.
