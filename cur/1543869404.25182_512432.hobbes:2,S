Hm, I thought as was clear, but apparently I messed up explaining my position:
1. I don't like BITWRAP name at all and I don't want anything like
that near input code. I think BIT is just fine.
2. I don't want to use BIT(x % BITS_PER_BITLONG) as it will
significantly litter code in the input drivers. You want see whta bits
you are actually setting behind all these "% BITS_PER_BITLONG".
3. I think most of users could use input's implementation of BIT,
possibly using BIT(x % BM_WIDTH) format to further limit width of the
bitmap if needed.
4. LLBIT should be provided to users who really want long long.
