Sure.  That is how Speedstep works, right?  We have an interface for
Speedstep, so the kernel knows about it.  We do not have an interface
for the proprietary BIOS stuff, I assume, so the kernel is oblivious.
But if you had the docs, I suppose you could code a solution and tie it
into the cpufreq code, just as we have proper support for Speedstep,
Longrun, etc.
