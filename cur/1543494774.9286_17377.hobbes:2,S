If you look at the dumps the requirements are
	2.2
	Symbios controller
	Right IBM disk (and the cases so far have a pair of adjacent firmware
		revisions)
2.0 defaults to a lower bus speed and to a smaller command queue. The obvious
thing for these two victims to do is therefore to try 5MHz and the smaller
queue.
Also for that matter they could do with bugging ibm about newer firmware
just in case.
