Hugh -- this is called full employment for kernel scalability analysts.
:-) :-)
Actually, disks are so slow that I wouldn't expect that scalability problem to 
show up in the page fault code, but rather in the block I/O or page cache 
management portions of the code instead.

I think that the major impact here is actually grabbing the lock when
30 or more processors are trying to obtain it -- the amount of time that the 
lock is actually held is insignificant in comparison.

That would be a useful avenue to explore.  Unfortunately, we are on kind of a 
tight fuse here trying to get the next kernel release ready.   At the moment 
we are in the mode of moving fixes from 2.4.21 to 2.6, and this is one such 
fix.   I'd be willing to pursue both in parallel so that in a future release
we have gotten to page_table_lock reduction as well.  Does that make sense at 
all?
(I just don't want to get bogged down in a 6-month effort here unless we can't 
avoid it.)

See above comment.

The original patch that we had for 2.4.21 did exactly that, we shied away from 
that due to concerns as to which processors allow you to update a running pte 
using a cmpxchg (== the set of processors for which set_pte() is a simple 
store.)  AFAIK, the only such processor is i386, but if Christoph is correct, 
then more recent Intel x86 processors don't even have that restriction.  I'll 
admit that I encouraged Christoph not to follow that path due to concerns of 
arch dependent code creeping into the do_anonymous_page() path.
