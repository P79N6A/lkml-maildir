Sorry? Did you read what I wrote?
I said: The ix86 insns set is hard to support.
You got a lot of instructions with a lot of modes and different lengths with
few registers. That's an old CISC design.

Well. Most OSes out there don't support SMP. Also, there are apps, which
don't profit much from multiple processors. Also note, that if 10% of your
app is not parallelizable, you will at most get 10 times the performance of
a single CPU by using multiple. Not counted communication overhead.
Maybe processor designers find it
more exciting to have those nighty features like specul. execution etc. 
One goal is to build a single very performing CPU. Consider the AXP-21264,
which I consider the most performant affordable chip out there. The AXp is a
RISC design, no question. But with the 21264, a lot of extra logic, such as
spec. execution, more than one insns per cycle, etc. was added. So, the
21264-500 outperforms the 21164-633 by a factor of 1.5 to 2.0 (!)
If you need plenty of performance, you will get several of those.
