Hi,

Well, I have one (N600c).
What am I supposed to see ? Is there anything special to do ?
I don't know exactly how fan control is supposed to be fixed.
Automatic wakeup/stop of these fans depending on the temperature
was already working.
Manual stopping of any fan (by writing into /proc/acpi/fan/*/state)
still doesn't work (don't know whether it's supposed to work or not).
By the way, I still see these errors during the boot, don't know if it's
supposed to be fixed :
  psparse-1133: *** Error: Method execution failed
