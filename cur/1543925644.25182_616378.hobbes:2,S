Blindly using -fno-tree-scev-cprop just to get rid of one case where
this turns out to be a pessimization when kernel knows ns is usually very
small is IMHO a wrong thing, you'd lose many cases where this optimization
can actually improve performance.  Instead, for this exact case just
add an optimization barrier to avoid gcc doing this.
Adding asm ("" : "=r" (ns) : "0" (ns)); (or hide it in some macro) into the
loop will do the job just fine.
