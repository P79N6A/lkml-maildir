No it was like:
"If you convince me that you need it, I'll implement it as a userspace
daemon". Longer term it is possible that all proxy arp (and RARP)
is moved into user space.

You mean the 2000 machines outside and the 100 machines inside are all
in the same network? If the 2000 machines are at least separated by a
router I would subnet your group's network, route through the linux
router and cut the machines over to the new netmask in a night or so
("been there, done that", on 80+ machines networks). 
Sooner or later you'll have to go with a more hierarchical network
setup anyways, ARP hacks won't save you long.
