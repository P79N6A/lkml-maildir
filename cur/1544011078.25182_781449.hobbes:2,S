I'm confused?
This doesn't look like the complete set of Jan Blunks union-mount patches. 
Am I mistaken?
On the llseek issue, I've been looking at the Overlay Filesystem 
(unmaintained for several years now), I ripped out a bunch of conditional 
compilation stuff to get a look at what was going on. The file system 
implements (or did at some point) a single overlayed file system view, 
namely the base and the overlay and so isn't general unioning. It is 
however, interesting because even though llseek isn't defined in the file 
operations of the pseudo file system it looks like it could be. It 
essentially uses a sub-system that exports a set of operations (which it 
calls a Storage Method) that provide a mapping layer between the pseudo 
file system (I guess that could be the VFS) and the overlayed file 
system(s). It has some undesirable baggage, such as its own complex list 
implementation, that AFAICS adds only nth element lookup functionality, 
which is what lead me to think of its possible use for the readdir issue.
But this also made me think about the issues surrounding whiteout support 
as having to add per-file system support for such things is bound to lead 
to a maintenance headache. So why not a well defined modular interface 
layer that includes these bits and is also responsible for context 
persistence, independent of file system?
