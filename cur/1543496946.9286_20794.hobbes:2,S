Hmmm, I guess that wasn't made clear - we are working on getting XFS
functioning in Linux ourselves, but some help would probably be
appreciated.
The thing we have to get done first is to produce an unencumbered
version
of the source - i.e. one which does not include code copyrighted by
people
other than SGI. After that hopefully other people can jump in.
