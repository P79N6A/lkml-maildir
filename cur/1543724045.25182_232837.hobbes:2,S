Hi,
I was trying to check if you can add multicast routes
to kernel using netlink sockets in a way similar to
unicast routes. As netlink sockets can be used to add
unicast routes to FIB, can you add multicast routes to
Multicast Forwarding Cache so that kernel can support
Multicast Forwarding?
 If this is possible, how would you go about giving
options to the netlink sockets?
Please inform me by CCing your answers/suggestions to
me.
Thanks,
Naveen.
