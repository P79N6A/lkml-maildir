I do this, which mostly works:
	MERGE_BASE=$(git-merge-base $(cat .git/refs/heads/origin ) \
				$(cat .git/refs/heads/$patch_name))
	cg-diff -r $MERGE_BASE:$(cat .git/refs/heads/$patch_name) >> \
				$PULL/$patch_name.patch
(I'm supposed to be doing real git merges of 40 trees and let git do more
work for me.  I'll do that when I'm feeling really, really trusting).
