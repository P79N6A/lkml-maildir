These function names could possibly clash with same-named functions
elsewhere, because they are not marked static. (This shows when two
features with same function names are compiled as y.) I grepped
through a 2.6.18 tree with unionfs, and unionfs was the only one
having this function name at this time. I would suggest prefixing it
somehow.
