Referring to this?
Intel MultiProcessor Specification v1.4
    Virtual Wire compatibility mode.
OEM ID: INTEL    Product ID: XXPRESS      APIC at: 0xFEE00000
Processor #0 5:2 APIC version 16
Processor #3 5:2 APIC version 16
Processor #4 5:2 APIC version 16
Unknown bustype XPRESS - ignoring
I/O APIC #14 Version 17 at 0xFEC00000.
I/O APIC #13 Version 17 at 0xFFE7F800.
Enabling APIC mode:  Flat.  Using 2 I/O APICs

John's check should be safe as it doesn't touch hardware anyway.
