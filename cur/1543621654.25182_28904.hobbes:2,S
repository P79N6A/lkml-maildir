Subject: [PATCH] Make IP-Config work without ip= supplied
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
Just noticed that IP-Config behavior when no ip= parm is used has changed in
2.2.18.
Up to 2.2.17 IP-Config was enabled even when ip= was omitted. I think that
it's good for use in i.e. diskless nodes.
Since 2.2.18, IP-Config does nothing at all until ip= is passed to the
kernel, however Documentation/nfsroot.txt still says that IP-Config is
enabled by default. Was that intentional change?
Such behavior remains in both 2.2.20 and 2.4.18-rc1. Following patches
(against these two kernel trees) make IP-Config enabled by default.
Cheers,
Krzysztof
