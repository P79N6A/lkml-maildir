Your analogy is poor and I vaguely doubt the mechanism has been
suggested by anyone for use in Linux ever. It has nothing whatsoever to
do with a microkernel and in most incarnations precludes microkernel
designs. I'm not suggesting it, I just thought that was what "per-cpu
stacks" was supposed to mean.
Not that elaboration is needed, but the threads of control are not
decoupled as you suggest, but rather connected with continuations at
what would in the UNIX model be scheduling points. spawn() is just
POSIX' API for optimizing out some of the overhead of a fork()/exec()
cycle, and has nothing to do with interrupt model programming, esp.
since it is the exact opposite of thread creation. i.e. the interrupt
model is the extreme incarnation of "state machines, not threads".
