My understanding of the old code was that it worked in PIO mode, but was
unsafe to use with DMA. I don't think anyone asking to have it upgraded to
work in DMA mode (not that anyone would object to that if it happened),
just don't remove the working PIO mode byteswap capability without some
thought as to how to achieve the same result.
also if another way becomes available to do the same job (i.e. loopback
with partition support) that will also solve my problem and I won't care
if direct byteswap support is removed.
what I do object to is the statement that "the sane solution would be to
not support swapping disks between these systems and other systems"
declaring that the capability that is currently in place and in use by
people should be eliminated with no replacement is wrong.
