Actually, because of the typeof in the powerpc WARN_ON, I think it
would fail to build since we'd be passing a long long value to an
inline asm, or at least I hope it would fail to build. :)
But your criticism is correct with regard to the powerpc BUG_ON, and
you're correct that a long wouldn't be sufficient if someone passes in
a long long.  Oh well.  I guess we just wear the extra two
instructions.
Paul.
