Daniel,
Do you want me to continue the patent attorney's analysis or not?  If I'm
spending money to help you here, I would appreciate you not bouncing off the
walls.  I am also having this guy put togther a provisional patent application
for your stuff, if you want to obtain a patent.  You are not going to 
change the USPTO, that's the system here, and like it or not, we all
just have to live with it.  The USPTO's authority is consitutional in 
it's basis regarding the rights of inventors (section 113), and unless
Congress and the Senate ammend the constitution, the USPTO and the rights
of inventors in the US will be protected. 
The list lurker non-lawyer technocrats waiving web pages around don't 
change the system, or provide the resources to help you.
