Hi,
  Have you any idea what happened to cpu-fp on the Dual Xeons?
Accross the other 2 platforms it is pretty stable, but cpu-fp
seems to have gone up a few % around 2.6.13-rc7 and dropped back
down around 2.6.1.4-rc2 and 2.6.14-rc4; now it isn't any lower
than where you started - but it would be nice to have whatever
it was that got that extra few %.
Dave
