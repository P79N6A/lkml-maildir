Creative Labs warns that it's sblive series of cards aren't compatible 
with SMP systems.  Though i've had the S2460 motherboard and the only 
trouble i have had was that EAX didn't work properly.  A friend of mine 
has an sblive with a dual celeron and he also has had this problem of 
deadlocks with the SBLive.  The audigy however is fully compatible.
Also, make sure you have an adequate power supply.
