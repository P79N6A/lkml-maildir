The arm pxa255 based Zaurus won't resume from a suspend with the patches
from the above tree applied. The suspend looks normal and gets at least
as far as pxa_pm_enter(). After that, the device appears to be dead and
needs a battery removal to reset. I'm unsure if it actually suspends and
is failing to resume or is crashing in the latter suspend stages.
Is there some documentation on what the above patch is aiming to do
anywhere?
