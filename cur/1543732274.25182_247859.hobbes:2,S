Yes, this is exactly right.  One issue raised by this thread is that
the ioctl32 compatibility code only allows one compatibility handler
per ioctl number.  It seems that this creates all sorts of
possibilities for mayhem because it makes the ioctl namespace global
in scope in some situations.  Does anyone have any thoughts on if/how
this should be addressed.
