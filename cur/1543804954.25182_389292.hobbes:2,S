yes the behavior is like this
                 root                non-root
before        about half of ram      nothing
after         all of ram             by default small, increasable

there is NO fundamental change here other than a *general* relaxing.
This is important to note: Apps that could mlock before STILL can mlock.
Only apps that would depend on mlock failing with a security check, and
only those who do small portions, break now because suddenly the mlock
succeeds. Big deal... those would have broken when run as root already

because it's generally a PER PROCESS limit, so fork 60 times and kaboom
things explode. (You can argue  you can forkbomb anyway, but that's
where the process count rlimit comes in)

it's not. Normal memory is swapable. And thus a far less rare commodity
than precious pinned down memory.
What application do you have in mind that broke by this relaxing of
rules?
