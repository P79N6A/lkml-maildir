I've tried this code with 2.6.1-mm1 and it results in my speakers
emitting a small high pitched noise when it's not busy playing audio,
using the intel8x0 driver. I'm using the onboard sound on my nForce2
based motherboard, here is the information in dmesg (not a lot,
admittedly) when i load the driver:
intel8x0_measure_ac97_clock: measured 49457 usecs
intel8x0: clocking to 47478
Otherwise it still seems to work OK.
