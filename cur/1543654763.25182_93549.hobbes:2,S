Marcelo, 
	Here is the Summit patch set again. This code is necessary in order to
boot w/ more then 4 physical cpus on a multi-CEC x440 system. All of
these patches were originally from James Cleverdon's Summit patch, which
I have broken up into smaller hopefully more digestable pieces. Thus all
credit is James' and all the blame is mine. 
The set is as follows:
1/4: Clustered apic tweaks
2/4: Logical/Physical apicid additions
3/4: CLUSTERED_APIC_XAPIC switches
4/4: CONFIG_X86_SUMMIT, autodetection, cleanup
Please consider for inclusion. 
thanks
-john
