But it _is_ entirely practical to run CML2 with a bog-standard python
1.5 interpreter. I just did a search/replace for the python2-ism's like
 <x> += <y>           =>  <x> = <x> + <y>, and
 <string>.<op>(<arg>) => string.<op>(<string>, <arg>)
Worked around some missing functionality in the older shlex and curses
modules and I can now use oldconfig, menuconfig, xconfig, and cmladvent
with CML2 and a python1 interpreter. It also still works fine with
python2 as well.

36K might sound like a lot, but given the fact that the CML python
sources totals about 280KB, it is a pretty small diff, and the whole
"but python2 isn't standard in distributions and the license is bad"
argument can be dropped and we can get on with life.
