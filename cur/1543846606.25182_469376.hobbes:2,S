drivers/ide is going away over time. I think the concept is nice and
it's sort of reflected in the libata VLB drivers. I think it would be a
very good way to get good platform drivers for libata for the embedded
platforms.
Moving the existing drivers/ide stuff to a new drivers/ide variant is
wasted work however.
