Not one that is Open Source....
Bind itself has been proven over many years. This is the first major
problem found. If you want a fix, get bind v9. Besides handling IP version
4, it also handles version 6.
The only current limitation is the inability to control sort order of
hosts with multiple interfaces. I think this is due to the new IP v 6
resource handling.
Bind 9 works well (see ISC web page 
http://www.isc.org/products/BIND/
)

It really isn't, but the new bind may be. There is even an update
to bind 8 that contains a fix for the problem.
