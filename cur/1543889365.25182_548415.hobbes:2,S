I knew mmconfig was broken conceptually the first time I started
seeing write posting "bug fixes" for it that would do a read back from
PCI config space via mmconfig to post the write, which of course has
potential side-effects on the device and is absolutely illegal if the
write just performed put the device into a PM state or whatever.
Truth is stranger than fiction at times.
MMCONFIG is very much an ill-conceived idea.
