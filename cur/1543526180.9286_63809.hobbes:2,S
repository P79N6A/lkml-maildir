  Hi, all. Version 158 of my devfs patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
The devfs FAQ is also available here.
This work has been sponsored by SGI.
NOTE: this is just a book-keeping release. This is the patch that was
sent to Linus and included in 2.3.46-pre5. Future devfs patches will
be a tad smaller :-)
This is against 2.3.46-pre2. Highlights of this release:
- Ported to kernel 2.3.46-pre2
				Regards,
					Richard....
