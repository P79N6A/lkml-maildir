Not all their source of course, just the source for the derived work.
I.e. we'll get their driver, but not anything else they might have.

Yes the GPL is a licence. By using the code, they have accepted
the licence.  If I use a copy of windows, I'll be forced to pay.
The reason courts usually award monetary damages is that
money is what almost everybody wants.  Commercial software,
books, CDs, DVSs are all traded for money, so copying one
means you must pay the copyright holder's loss.
The GPL should work exactly the same way: You distribute
software derived from GPL software, you pay the usual price.
But the usual price for GPLed software is not money,
the usual price is the derived source.
That is what IBM pays when porting linux to their processors,
that is what various hardware vendors pay when they make an
open driver based on small changes to existing drivers.
And that is how I believe a vendor should be forced to pay,
should he have the nerve to distribute a driver that blatantly
works around the EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL mechanism.

Interesting text.  Seems the FSF takes a 'nicer' approach, and that
works well enough.  Still, if someone tries to be difficult, I hope
they'll be forced to pay the usual price - which isn't money.
It'd be hard to set a price anyway, given that GPL software
isn't usually sold.  The price of having a professional programmer
developing the same driver perhaps?
