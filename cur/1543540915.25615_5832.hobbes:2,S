Are you using framebuffer or text console?  Especially the VESA
framebuffer could need a bit more CPU while redrawing top and generally
be not very CPU friendly.  Also the APM power saving halt may only be
entered after a timeout of nothing to do, which may happen under X but
not under console.  Depends on the driver access pattern, I guess.
