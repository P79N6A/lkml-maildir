Of course not. "Security" as such is more than less "only" risk
management (or part of it - depending of the viewpoint).

If people don't care, they are pretty lost anyway.
That's actually the reason for all that security stuff that no one wants
but which stands in the way of all people just because of the "don't
care" faction (which by far the majority of all in any given area).
But there is that (also not too small) "I installed $PERSONAL_FIREWALL
and *nothing* can happen because $VENDOR and $TECH_JOURNALIST in
$LOW_QUALITY_PC_MAG said so" faction.

And every layer/subsystem/area must be checked and seen independently of
others (or the dependency must be that strong that no one can work
around).
And every security layer will and should have it's purpose and targets.

"selinux=0" on the kernel commandline is normal - no unknown people have
logins and so there was no reason to learn it. And against should it
protect in the first place if only trusted people are there?

No, how do you come to that conclusion?
People login as "Administrator" because they did it since DOS3.0.
People buy and install $PERSONAL_FIREWALL because some cheap PC tech
magazine had advertisements for them.
Next generation (or this generation?) viruses/malware will either
reconfigure $PERSONAL_FIREWALL silently (and if course only
temporarily).
And the vendor of $PERSONAL_FIREWALL writes into the manual (which no
one reads) or the EULA (which no one reads because it isn't relevant in
the first place) or some README (which no one finds) that one must not
login as "Administrator". But that just to keep the vict^Wbuyers to not
sue them. And working on Win* without being "Administrator" is a real
PITA - so the average user won't do it for long.
So apart from the personal feelings of that user I can't find any sign
of security.
BTW from a commercial viewpoint, the (so-called) "personal firewalls"
were probably one of the best ideas (and another major example that
technical expertise has nothing to do with sales success).
