Poor guy ! People are not against Reiser4, they are against the stupid and
irritating person who pollutes the lists always sending the same results
without any comment because he doesn't even understand the results. Just
like the kid on the beach "Look Ma, I found a soft shell!". "Leave it
overthere, it's a jellyfish !".  "I don't know what a jellyfish is, I will
take all those soft shells with me".
You keep saying people do not want to read you, but there is nothing to read.
In fact, you hope that people will comment on your results so that you will
finally understand them, but people keep saying there is nothing to read there.
When will you stop annoying people with your noisy toys ?
Oh, and please send your conspiracy claims somewhere else.
