        Hi Jeff,
	More IrDA driver fixes that I want you to push in
2.6.0-testX. VIA has updated their driver according to your whishes
(with help from Oliver Neukum).
	Patches tested on 2.6.0-test2.
        Thanks in advance...
        Jean

[FEATURE] : Add a new feature to the IrDA stack
[CORRECT] : Fix to have the correct/expected behaviour
[CRITICA] : Fix potential kernel crash
ir260_donau_cleanup.diff :
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		<Patch from Christian Gennerat>
	o [CORRECT] Disable chip probing that fail too often
	o [FEATURE] Cleanup STATIC
ir260_lap_retry_count.diff :
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	o [CORRECT] add interoperability workaround for 2.4.X IrDA stacks
ir260_usb_probe-4.diff :
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		<Patch from Oliver Neukum and Daniele Bellucci>
	o [CORRECT] minor fix to the probe failure path of irda-usb.
ir260_via_ircc-4.diff :
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		<Patch from Frank Liu/VIA and Oliver Neukum>
	o [FEATURE] driver for IrDA integrated in VIA chipsets
	o [CORRECT] Use PCI table for probing
	o [FEATURE] Beautify source code
ir260_vlsi-05.diff :
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		<Patch from Martin Diehl>
* correct endianess conversion of hardware exposed fields
* we need to check crc16 of rx frames in SIR-mode
  (hardware does this in MIR/FIR modes). Use irda_calc_crc16.
* get rid of BUG'gers - having them in interrupt path isn't fun.
* don't return NET_XMIT_DROP when we drop (dev_kfree_skb_any)
  frames. This value is meant to ask for retransmit so we would
  corrupt the skb slab.
* locking review, corrections and improvements: particularly focus 
  on speed setting and start_xmit paths, but also reducing time
  we are staying with interrupts disabled.
* printk-cleanup: less/better syslog msgs, use IRDA_DEBUG and friends.
* default qos_mtt_bits should be 1ms or longer (0x07), not exactly 1ms
* rename IRENABLE_IREN -> IRENABLE_PHYANDCLOCK
* few minor improvements 
* compatibility stuff to preserve 2.4 backport path
* it's a pci controller, so we should depend on CONFIG_PCI
* DRIVER_VERSION 0.5
ir260_tekram-sir.diff :
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		<Patch from Martin Diehl>
	o [CORRECT] Update tekram-sir dongle driver to common power-settling
ir260_ircomm_owner.diff :
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		<Patch from Andrey Borzenkov>
	o [CORRECT] Update module refcount in IrCOMM module
ir260_nsc_39x_fixes.diff :
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		<Patch from Jan Frey>
	o [CORRECT] Make NSC 3839x probe and init *really* work
