I've used a couple of Dells, Lattitudes and Inspirons, and using APM
rather than ACPI worked, the apm command gave me battery status and IIRC
"apm -s" worked to put the Lattitude to sleep.
Don't know if this will work for you or is all you need, it met my humble
needs.
Note: this was with a 2.4 kernel, I don't recall if I tested the 2.5 for
this particular ability.
