Subject: [PATCH 0/11] UML - Tickless and timekeeping update
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/12/284

This patchset modernizes UML's timekeeping system.  There are a number
of cleanups, but the major items are clockevent and clocksource
support, followed by tickless support.
This is obviously 2.6.24 material.
