Hi Dipankar!
Hi Rusty!
just a short question regarding RCU callbacks:
it seems that the RCU callback is not allowed 
to (re-)schedule, as it is done occasionally by 
put_namespace() for example, as I keep getting 
"bad: scheduling while atomic!", when I do so ...
now the question: what is the 'correct' way to
drop a reference to a namespace when freeing up 
a structure from an RCU callback?
TIA,
Herbert
