Yeah.  I think that's broken.  It gets worse when you start doing other
posixy things.  Say you do 'mv foo bar:baz' on an ntfs partition.
Those strong in the force will recall that rename() is supposed to
atomically unlink 'bar:baz'.  Instead you seem to be asking it to add
an extra stream to 'bar'.  So should we still unlink the old 'bar'?
And then what if 'foo' is a multi-stream file?  Where do the extra
streams go?  Or do you just get a big fat -EINVAL for every special
case?
I think ultimately there is no posixy (or least-surprise) way to deal
with such things.  If we truly need forks, we need a new api to
manipulate them.  Cleverness with ':' or '/' only takes you so far.
