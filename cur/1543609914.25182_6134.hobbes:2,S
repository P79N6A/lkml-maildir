Are you running a current version of e2fsprogs?  1.25?
If you are, then this indicates that the filesystem has has_journal
set, but it doesn't have a journal inode.  That is certainly something
which e2fsck should detect and fix.  This may be a fsck bug.
You should be able to fix this with `tune2fs -O ^has-journal' on
the unmounted or readonly fs.
