I've also seen my machine die on taking down the ippp0 interface
("service isdn stop") - not on hanging up ("isdnctrl hangup ippp0").
I keep forgetting to investigate, because it's extremely rare that I 
actually disconnect or reboot, rather than just hitting the reset button 
when X has segfaulted again.
Is your machine SMP?
