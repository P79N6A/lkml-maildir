Sure. Just looking at a couple of cases:
On range comparisons such as (a < CONST):
* without this patch, you end up with a comparison, then a cr-to-cr op +
mfcr + mask operation + tdnei.
* with the patch, you get a comparison and a conditional branch with
twi out of line.
On multiple comparisons like WARN_ON( a || b), it seems that there's an
added li to make the tdnei always hit for the first case. There it uses
a regular conditional branch, so no real difference in generated code
besides that.
Code examples. This was with a ppc64_defconfig, so CONFIG_POWER4_ONLY
wasn't enabled. It uses mfocrf when it is, which is alot cheaper. Still,
the rest of the code sequence is the same:
void irq_free_virt(unsigned int virq, unsigned int count)
{
        unsigned long flags;
        unsigned int i;
        WARN_ON (virq < NUM_ISA_INTERRUPTS);
        WARN_ON (count == 0 || (virq + count) > irq_virq_count);
        spin_lock_irqsave(&irq_big_lock, flags);
