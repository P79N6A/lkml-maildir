except the mips-only change, the only thing missing is one #include "param.h".

yes, it's a requirement. There are still a few issues left:
o stability - the machine i tried this on locked up hard while running
  a kernel with this patch. It's otherwise rock solid... Hmm, was there
  a known (scheduling) bug in 2.3.5 that could get triggered by a big HZ?
  Will try to reproduce...
o the ip routing sysctls (i'd rather not touch these)
o /proc/net/tcp and friends (look at the "netstat -to" output...),
   this one will be easy to fix.
