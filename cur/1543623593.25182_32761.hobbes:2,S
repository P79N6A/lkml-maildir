Plese note that the mail in wich I did send this particular patch didn't
contain the cleanup term. OK?

Wen don't need "a nice general interface for the usual things". We need
the POSIX interface to them ;-).
However I agree that there is need for advanced features.
But first of all please notice that the
current "TASK FILE" code found there is not quite there. Second
please note that I would rather have a true lean *abstract* ioctl/sysctl
based interface to the really common things like spin down for example
and a tinny ioctl based interface for the people who love to break
hardware by software. Not quite what is there - the current taskfile
just tryes and fails (it's really hard to handle interrupts in user 
space) to map every single ATA-6 standard command to an ioctl().
The supposed validation of the commands prevents basically it's true
purpose as a back door for vendors loving to do things like controller
firmware updates through undefined commands.
I hope this makes my opinins clear.
