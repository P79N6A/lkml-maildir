Yes. I know. I know even more: Linux is NOT Unix. Why we should borrow each
and every idea from Unix without even thinking is beyond me.

I'm not use Unix, I use Linux.

l-k is *LINUX*-kernel mailing list, not *UNIX*-kernel ...

Just since system created only by kernel hackers without interaction with
non-kernel hackers will be usable ONLY for kernel hackers. BTW I seen that
code. It's little non-standard usage of VFS but it's real life, not academic
research.

It worked with gcc :-) Yes, here problem is not enough to solve it such
painfull way, but who knows...

Are you sure that raw I/O was included just since it looked good in kernel
sources ? I bet no. It's solution for problem not in kernel but outside of
kernel. The same with devfs. BTW since most arguments against devfs was NOT
technical ones (even from Linus !!!) I can not understood how reading of
kernel sources will help here...

It's prerequisite ONLY when something is rejected purely on techincal basis.
This is not a case with devfs.
