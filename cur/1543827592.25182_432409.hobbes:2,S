Oh and
The comment should read something like:
	/*
	 * above_background_load() is expensive so we only perform
	 * it every SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX prefetched_pages.
	 * We test to see if we're above_background_load as disk activity
	 * even at low priority can cause interrupt induced scheduling
	 * latencies.
