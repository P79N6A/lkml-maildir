Hi Andrew and everyone interested in NTFS,
The former ntfs-2.6-devel BK repository is now converted to a GIT
repository and is available from:
{rsync,ftp,http}.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/aia21/ntfs-2.6-devel.git
It would be great if you could add it to the -mm tree.
Please let me know if you have any problems with this tree or indeed if
you prefer a patch / patches (against what?) that I can make available
to you instead.
Best regards,
        Anton
