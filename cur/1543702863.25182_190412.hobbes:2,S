Hmmmm. Does anybody have any idea why these names differ? Googling for 
acpi/ac_adapter gives me hits on a number of different programs that 
check for ac_adapter/*/state. I've seen AC, ACAD, 0 and 1 for names, so 
they're really pretty variable. So, a wildcard seems appropriate. Dax, 
if you agree, would you test + send in a patch to correct this? I can't 
do it myself because I can't test it. TIA!
