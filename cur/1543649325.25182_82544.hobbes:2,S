Nope.  Some architectures _do not_ pad 64-bit arguments, others _do_.
On ARM/x86, we currently do use arg3 for the low part of the argument,
but on PPC we use it for the high part because of this sexswapping
crap being done in userspace.

I'd love to move to that model.  But I suspect we need a consensus to
_never_ pass 64-bit quantities across the syscall boundary, and we
aren't going to get it.  So we're going to add more crap every time
someone adds a loff_t ;-(
