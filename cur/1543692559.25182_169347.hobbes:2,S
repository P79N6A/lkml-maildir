Hi.
I just realized, that /dev/vcsa behaviour is broken when
used with lines or columns more than 255.  I can easily
get this behaviour by using the built-in 4x6 font on a
1024xsomething resolution.  That results in 256 columns.  However,
the vcs devices expose dimensions and cursor position in the first
4 bytes.
My question is now:  Are we stuck with this now?  I found that
it is at least possible to use TIOCGWINSZ on the corresponding
/dev/tty%d device to get correct dimensions, but then again, how
would I optain the cursor position?
I am wondering why a char was choosen at all.  I see no gain
by "saving" space there...
