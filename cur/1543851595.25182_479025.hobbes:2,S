I think it would be cleaner to add a check in reserve_bootmem_generic
that just returns when pfn >= end_pfn && pfn < end_pfn_mapped
How about this patch? Does it work?

Handle reserve_bootmem_generic beyond end_pfn
This can happen on kexec kernels with some configurations, in particularly
on Unisys ES7000 systems.
