I am still not convinced that this isn't the better approach overall; yes, the
full ksymall table takes a few kb in memory, which can be avoided if one has a
full vmlinux / System.map archive (as it would in theory be possible for a
distribution for all shipped kernels), but having the fully decoded Oops - or
at least, as far as possible - would certainly be more useful in the general
case, and for self-compiled kernels.
Sincerely,
