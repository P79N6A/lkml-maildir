I think it's not so much that people don't care, as that until recently,  
people didn't have a good way to measure the latency.
I certainly do remember the recurring debate about "interactive  
responsiveness", which is *exactly* the kind of latency we are talking  
about here - in this case, from pressing a key (thus generating an  
interrupt) to seeing the echo from, say, vi (thus getting a process to  
run).
But I also recall that the comments were "this feels much snappier", "this  
feels like molasses". You just can't optimize for 5ms latencies on the  
basis of feelings. Humans are bad at doing this kind of measurements.
