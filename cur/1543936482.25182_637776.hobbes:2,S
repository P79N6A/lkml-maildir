GregKH, adding a new dynamically loadable subsystem is not something
that happens every day, can you check to make sure all of the standard
kernels mechanisms are being used? I'm not totally sure how the
modalias naming code is supposed to be done. The subsystem core code
in these patches needs review.
Jean, could you take over the i2c core portion of the patch? That will
let you decide exactly how you want the driver_name/name fields to be
dealt with. After you get standard naming support into i2c core I'll
rework the rest of the patch to use your new code.
I don't think driver_name/name fields should be stored in an i2c
structure at all. They are redundant with the standard mechanism.
The kernel automatically exposes modalias as a sysfs attribute so the
string must be recorded further down in the driver support layers. No
need to keep a copy in the i2c structure.
Standard devices don't export a 'name' attribute. To see the driver
name for a device in sysfs look at the 'driver' link.
