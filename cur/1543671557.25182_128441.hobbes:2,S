Recently compiled 2.4.21-rc1 on two systems with Intel boards, one an
i850 based board where there were no problems with the APIC being
enabled (as it was also with an earlier kernel) but an i845 based board
(Intel D845PT, latest BIOS) would not enable the APIC (all XT-PIC in
/proc/interrupts) until I applied the -ac3 patch, even though the APIC
has worked fine under that other OS.
