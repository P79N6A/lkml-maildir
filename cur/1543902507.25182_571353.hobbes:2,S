It should be ok nowdays. Calling ld->receive() paths directly from an IRQ
is verboted however.

I have no idea of the history of con_schedule_flip and I leave it alone 8)

For tty it is ok to call tty_flip_buffer_push from an IRQ. It is also ok
for this to do stuff based on the low latency flag. Any private internal
knowledge of that happens is at the drivers peril and may change.
We *need* low latency to do MIDI, Digitrax DCC and a few other things.
A driver which sets ->low_latency must allow its own write() method to be
called back as a result of calling tty_flip_buffer_push, and that
requires care on driver coding. (Arguably we should have a ->echo()
method for this but that opens other cans of worms)
