I upgraded from 2.6.15-rc7 to 2.6.17-rc1. rc1 seems nice other than that
iptables stopped working:
 failed iptables v1.3.5: can't initialize iptables table filter: iptables
 who? (do you need to insmod?) 
 Perhaps iptables or your kernel needs to be upgraded.
iptables is compiled in the kernel, not a module:
 CONFIG_NETFILTER=y
I can even do "modprobe iptable_nat" successfully (iptable_nat is module),
but iptables refuses to work. iptables is of version iptables-1.3.5-1.2. 
The kernel config is copied with make oldconfig from 2.6.15-rc7 (which
worked), not much else has changed. I just booted back to 2.6.15-rc7 and
verified it works. Any ideas?
