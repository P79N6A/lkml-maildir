I assume you refer to this:
		 * FIXME! We still have a race here: if somebody
		 * adds the page back to the page tables in
		 * between the "page_mkclean()" and the "TestClearPageDirty()",
		 * we might have it mapped without the dirty bit set.
		 */
		if (page_mkclean(page))
			set_page_dirty(page);
		if (TestClearPageDirty(page)) {
			dec_zone_page_state(page, NR_FILE_DIRTY);
			return 1;
		}
I guess the comment actually refers to a writefault after the
set_page_dirty() and before the TestClearPageDirty().  The fault handler
will run set_page_dirty() and will return to userspace to rerun the write. 
The page then gets set pte-dirty but this thread of control will now make
the page !PageDirty() and will write it out.
With Nick's proposed lock-the-page-in-pagefaults patches, we have
lock_page() synchronisation between pagefaults and
clear_page_dirty_for_io() which I think will fix this.
