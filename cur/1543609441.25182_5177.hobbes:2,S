My absolute favourite is the following in arch/i386/kernel/irq.c!!!!
Disease symptoms like this are distributed all over the kernel code.
========================================================================
static struct proc_dir_entry * root_irq_dir;
static struct proc_dir_entry * irq_dir [NR_IRQS];
#define HEX_DIGITS 8
static unsigned int parse_hex_value (const char *buffer,
		unsigned long count, unsigned long *ret)
{
	unsigned char hexnum [HEX_DIGITS];
	unsigned long value;
	int i;
