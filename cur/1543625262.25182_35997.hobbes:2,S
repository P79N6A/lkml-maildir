This patch was intended to prevent this from happening.  I hope I didn't miss 
something.
The dumping thread doesn't proceed until the other CPU's have gotten into 
kernel mode and done 2 IPI's.  One to reschedule the other cpu's and one to 
synchronize before exiting suspend_other_threads.  
The way the IPI's are sent out by this patch, the other CPUs get 2 IPI's and 
execute at least one IRET, and hence at least one call to schedule, before 
the dumping process continues.  This one call to schedule on each of the 
other cpu's is what's needed to get all possible related thread processes 
swapped out for the duration of the dump.
Unless the IPI's and associated IRET's get dropped by the system, that 3rd 
thread will not get a chance to touch the cpu_masks before the dumping 
process is finished taking its dump and resume_other_threads gets called.   
Because it will have been scheduled out.
