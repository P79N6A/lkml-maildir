The LVM snapshots would provide the guarantee of consistancy
which would be nice for those who aren't setting it up as
part of their infrastructure but it isn't all that messy.
The issue came up recently on the rsync list of syncing CVS
repositories.  The discussion concluded with:
If the history file (or another single file) is enough:
        starthist=`ls -l $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/history`
        curhist=""
        while [ "$Starthist" != "$curhist" ]
        do
		starthist=`ls -l $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/history`
                rsync .....
                curhist=`ls -l $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/history`
        done
If not you can test the directory.
        ls -l $CVSROOT/CVSROOT >$TMPFILE.start
        touch $TMPFILE.test
        until diff -q $TMPFILE.start $TMPFILE.test >/dev/null
        do
		ls -l $CVSROOT/CVSROOT >$TMPFILE.start
                rsync .....
                ls -l $CVSROOT/CVSROOT >$TMPFILE.test
        done
        rm -f $TMPFILE.start $TMPFILE.test
