It may sound odd, but appears to be conincidental that you got the
oops after having moved to a new system. You probably have more
memory now, right? This is an old bug - scan_scsis calls
scsci_init_malloc
and doesn't check if whether it returns a valid address. I know Douglas
Gilbert did some hacking on this, but I don't know if his work made
it into the 2.2 series as well?
