I can't rename files on Pupkin's drive because he won't like it. ;)
In the case with a flash drive I can copy all the files to my computer
and rename them, but I can't do it with a bigger media like hard disk.
The main idea of VFS is that you can access your files in the same way
on any supported file system. But actually you can't simple access
different-encoded non-ascii files on a filesystem that has no NLS,
like ext or reiser.
