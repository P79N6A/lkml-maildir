Point well taken.  A revised patch with your suggested fix is below.

Although this sounds like a good idea, I'm uncomfortable taking the
fix to this level as part of this patch.  If CONFIG_KALLSYMS is not set,
the Makefile doesn't even compile kallsyms.c due to this:
kernel/Makefile:obj-$(CONFIG_KALLSYMS) += kallsyms.o
To keep the functionality you mentioned, we'd have to keep kallsyms.o 
and keeping kallsyms.o in the kernel would have a whole different
set of ramifications in the kernel that I don't want to chase down.
It probably would be easy, but it's beyond the scope of this fix,
and therefore probably best left to a separate patch.
Feel free to send that out in another patch if you want.  If you do,
I'd be happy to test it, review it, and ACK it.
Regards,
Bob Peterson
