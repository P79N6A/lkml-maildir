Could you send me the .tmp_kallsyms2.S and System.map files from
this kernel build, please, please, please?
I really want to address this problem, but without hardware and
without more information I'm a little in the dark (although
looking at the resulting names already gives some clues).
Also, doing a "cat /proc/kallsyms" shows the same kind of behavior,
doesn't it? (just to be sure)
TIA,
