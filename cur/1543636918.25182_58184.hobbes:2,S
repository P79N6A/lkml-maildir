O_DIRECT tends to be used in specialised applications.  They're
being silly if they're reading from holes.

It's actually tons more expensive - wiping the page by hand
goes against the whole reason for using O_DIRECT.
But it is the expected behaviour of the read() system call
so yeah, I'll do it.

This is going to be fairly involved.  Probably the top-level
IO code gets ripped up and redone to expect a get_blocks()
interface.  A default implementation of get_blocks() would
be provided for naive filesystems - it just calls get_block()
a lot.  Quite possibly, we say to heck with purity and get_block()
and get_blocks() become a_ops, too.
I'd really like to see a solid reason for doing all this.
That means numbers ;)  Even good old ext2 would be able to show
benefit from batching up the get_block() work, but not a lot.
You won't buy much on writes, I expect - 8k write requests
will probably remain the ideal size.
