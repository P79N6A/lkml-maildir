Now that 2.4.9 is well behind us, it's time to update

Thanks

-buffermem:
-
-The three values in this file correspond to the values in
-the struct buffer_mem. It controls how much memory should
-be used for buffer memory. The percentage is calculated
-as a percentage of total system memory.
-
-The values are:
-min_percent	-- this is the minimum percentage of memory
-		   that should be spent on buffer memory
-borrow_percent  -- UNUSED
-max_percent     -- UNUSED

-==============================================================
-freepages:
-
-This file contains the values in the struct freepages. That
-struct contains three members: min, low and high.
-
-The meaning of the numbers is:
-
-freepages.min	When the number of free pages in the system
-		reaches this number, only the kernel can
-		allocate more memory.
-freepages.low	If the number of free pages gets below this
-		point, the kernel starts swapping aggressively.
-freepages.high	The kernel tries to keep up to this amount of
-		memory free; if memory comes below this point,
-		the kernel gently starts swapping in the hopes
-		that it never has to do real aggressive swapping.

-pagecache:
-
-This file does exactly the same as buffermem, only this
-file controls the struct page_cache, and thus controls
-the amount of memory used for the page cache.
-
-In 2.2, the page cache is used for 3 main purposes:
-- caching read() data from files
-- caching mmap()ed data and executable files
-- swap cache
-
-When your system is both deep in swap and high on cache,
-it probably means that a lot of the swapped data is being
-cached, making for more efficient swapping than possible
-with the 2.0 kernel.
