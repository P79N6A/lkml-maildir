This sounds like a well-known APM/local-APIC clash.
Never ever use DISPLAY_BLANK if you also have SMP or UP_APIC.
With APIC support enabled (SMP or UP_APIC), APM must be constrained:
DISPLAY_BLANK off
CPU_IDLE off
built-in driver, not module
This is because the apm driver does BIOS calls, and many BIOSen
(including the code in graphics cards, e.g. all Radeons it seems)
like to hang if a local APIC timer interrupt arrives.
