I'm not sure - isn't it more likely that someone stuffed up in usbfs?  BUG_ON
seems kind of harsh, since it will kill the hub thread.  If it wasn't for that I
wouldn't hesitate to use BUG_ON here.

I don't see that there is anything wrong with USB using it's own constructs even
if they were just defined to be equal to some centralized macro (as they probably
should be).  In fact there is an advantage: they can be modified for debugging
purposes (to add a backtrace for example) without disturbing the rest of the
kernel.
All the best,
Duncan.
