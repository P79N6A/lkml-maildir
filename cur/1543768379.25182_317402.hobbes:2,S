I had the same problem with an external 250 GB vfat USB 2.0 disk.
The disk was formatted/used previously in windows, checkdisk said is OK,
but mounted in linux readonly, game the same error (said only some little
space was free, when in fact it was almost full).
However, I was able to see and copy all files from it.
As it was not my hard disk, I did not reformatted it, nor dosfsck-ed it.
DOSFSCK reported errors with the FAT copy, and other errors, but as I
said, I could access all data on it.
Best regards,
Paul
