- The current situation is broken
- In spec hardware does not require MSI to generate interrupts
  Which leaves enabling MSI optional.
Do you have a better idea to solve the current brokenness?
MSI appears to have enough problems that enabling it in a kernel
that is supposed to run lots of different hardware (like a distro
kernel) is a recipe for disaster.
