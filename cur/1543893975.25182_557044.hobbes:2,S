Subject: l-k-digest downtime + bounces
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

lists.us.dell.com hosts digest forms of lkml: linux-kernel-digest and
linux-kernel-daily-digest.  In the process of moving lists.us.dell.com
new hardware and a new OS, some messages sent to lkml this evening may
have bounced or been dropped by the digester.  This would only affect
those people subscribed to one of the digest forms of the list.
I apologize for the inconvenience.
Thanks,
Matt
