I'm disappointed only due to the problems it creates maintaining
RPM packages and multiple releases, and such.  Also the confusion
and problems it creates the end user.
One must also understand that XFree86 is not just for Linux.
Their release cycles are not timed for Linux kernel releases or
any distribution of Linux release.  XFree86 is on their own
schedule, and support numerous operating systems on many hardware
platforms.  So XFree86 by default is not linux centric
necessarily, but rather supports Linux as one of many platforms,
Linux just being one of the primary platforms.
The guys at VA certainly know their stuff, and I have total faith
in them.  (Lame pun not intended Rik...)  ;o)
I believe we will see a more stable DRM future now that this has
all been brought up.
