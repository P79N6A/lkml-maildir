Andres Salomon (-as patches) and I have been talking about that at least
regarding security fixes.  It's worth trying in a more complete and
formalized way.  Guess I can be branded a sucker ;-)

I like this definition.  The only remaining question is what determines
a 2.6.x.y release?  One patch?  Sure if it's critical enough.

Heh, maybe people are happiest when they are whining ;-)
