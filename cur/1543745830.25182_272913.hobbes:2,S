This was fixed (post 2.6.9) with the addition of the ldisc->hangup
method in the ppp_async and ppp_synctty line disciplines.
The bug reporter has a Windows NT server that terminates
the connection without sending the proper LCP packets.
The Linux box had previously relied on DCD negation
to indicate loss of connection via hangup. Alan's
locking changes removed the ldisc->close from do_hangup()
so the line discipline was no longer aware of the hangup.
Adding the ldisc->hangup method restored
detection of connection loss.
I reproduced this in lab, and tested the fix successfully.
I don't remember which version the patch was accepted.
