Subject: ACPI status in 2.5.x/2.6.0

I have a Compaq Laptop (*shiver*) and present distro versions featuring 
the 2.4.x kernel seem to panic or lock on bootup on my laptop.  I was 
wondering if ACPI was better supported in the 2.5.x kernel branch/2.6.0 
pre-kernel.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
It would lock when attempting to read my partition table on device 'hda' 
(my hard disk), or would panic when attempting to initalize the USB device.
