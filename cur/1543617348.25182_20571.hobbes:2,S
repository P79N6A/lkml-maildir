RR tasks were queued to the expired array.

i agree - but your new patch is broken still, you have the timeslice range
inverted(!) :-)
but never mind, i've fixed this and added the code to -I1, check it out
at:
    
http://redhat.com/~mingo/O
(1)-scheduler/sched-O1-2.5.2-final-I1.patch
(for the record, i've tested -I1 on SMP and UP as well.)
-I1 also includes a fix from Dave Jones: mmu_context.h was still included
in arch/i386/kernel/process.c.

i fully agree - in -I0 i have kept the 'child gets 10% less priority than
parent' rule. This works really well in fork-bomb situations, i've tested
this with -I0. (and -I1 as well.) It also works well with interactive
shells, which want to start processes which will inherit *some* of their
parent's priority, but not all of it.

Think about starting a simple 'ls' under X if under some high load. This
works just fine under 2.5.2-vanilla and 2.5.2-I0 as well. We should give
the task a chance to finish within ... 500 or 1000 msecs (or so), most
shell commands that fork do so.

(i've done this already in -I0, based on earlier comments of yours.)

please re-test this with -I1. (i've tested it and it works just fine, but
more testing cannot hurt.)
are there any other items in your patch that are not yet in -I1?
