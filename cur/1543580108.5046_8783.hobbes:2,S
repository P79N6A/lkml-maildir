Can anyone tell me whether there is support for the HP Colorado 8Gb (IDE 
version) tape drive in the Linux kernel and/or user space?
If there is kernel support which of the kernel options do I have to enable 
/ where do I get user space utilities from? Any pointers?
Thanks a lot for the help in advance.
Best regards,
         Anton
