Can you dump out all of the variables in the 
	if (phys_addr < virt_to_phys(high_memory)) {
	...
statement, plus the arguments that ioremap() is getting?
Evidently, it's OK if highmem pages aren't PageReserved(), and I'm
starting to wonder if you've done something rare, like spanned the
highmem boundary with your ioremap().  
We do some weird stuff with that highmem boundary when NUMA is on,
because we remap a bunch of mem_map[] in that area to get it local on
NUMA nodes which might be causing something unexpected.  Take a look and
see if any of the variables that __ioremap() is using correspond to
those that remap_numa_kva() is playing with (from your boot log):
node 0 will remap to vaddr f8000000 - f8000000
node 1 will remap to vaddr f5600000 - f8000000
High memory starts at vaddr f8000000    
It's just a guess.
