I'm always seeing this too in my box (which is running 2.6.0).
Jeff, Alan, the assert seem erroneous?
/**

static inline void via_chan_maybe_start (struct via_channel *chan)
{
        assert (chan->is_active == sg_active(chan->iobase));
and
static int sg_active (long iobase)
{
        u8 tmp = inb (iobase + VIA_PCM_STATUS);
        if ((tmp & VIA_SGD_STOPPED) || (tmp & VIA_SGD_PAUSED)) {
                printk(KERN_WARNING "via82cxxx warning: SG stopped or paused\n");
                return 0;
        }
        if (tmp & VIA_SGD_ACTIVE)
                return 1;
        return 0;
}
The driver works normally, even with the assert happening:
