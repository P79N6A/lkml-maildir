Hi Serguei,
Could you please verify that this patch fixes the problem?  I've cc'd this
to others who have also reported the same symptoms.
This patch is a candidate for 2.2.10.  The problem it is supposed to fix
only manifests itself when the BIOS is set to an EPP mode.  Please try
this patch out and let me know if it works or not.
Thanks,
Tim.
