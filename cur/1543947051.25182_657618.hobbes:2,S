that is not a big problem at all. If you have to enforce a specific  
module load order then create some dummy exports like misdn_load() and  
use them from the module that depends on it. It is not beautiful, but  
sometimes you have to do it this way. So if that is stopping mainline  
inclusion it is a lame excuse.
