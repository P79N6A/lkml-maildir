I have to disagree.  Awhile back, if you remember, I posted a patch to
the LTT daemon that would monitor the trace stream in real time, and
process it using an embedded Perl interpreter, no less:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=109405724500237&w=2
It didn't seem to have any problems keeping up with the trace stream
even though it was monitoring all LTT event types (and a couple of
others - custom events injected using kprobes) and not doing any
filtering in the kernel, through kernel compiles, normal X traffic,
etc.  I don't know what volume of event traffic would cause this model
to break down, but I think it shows that at least some level of
non-trivial live processing is possible...
