Hi Christoph!

Other wan drivers are doing the same:
[marcelo@logos wan]$ grep __devinitdata *
farsync.c:static char *type_strings[] __devinitdata = {
wanxl.c:static struct pci_device_id wanxl_pci_tbl[] __devinitdata = {
I believe a handful of others are using "__devinitdata". How can the
kernel crash because of this? Who will try to touch the data?

Yes I will change to dev_dbg() as Greg suggested. Thanks!
