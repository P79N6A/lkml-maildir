I know your cpus have idle time, that not the question.
But *when* your cpus are not idle, they might be slowed down because of cache line transferts between them. This patch doesnt reduce contention, just latencies (and overall performance)
I dont currently have SMP test machine, so I couldnt test it myself.
On x86_64, I am pretty sure the patch would help, because offsetof(mmap_sem) = 0x60
On i386, offsetof(mmap_sem)=0x34, so this patch wont help.
As you said, throughput can raise and idle time raise too.
