To find them you just walk the sections.  Changing cond call is a slow
path operation. That is similar to how the smp lock switching
works today.

Sounds similar to config.h then when Kconfig keeps track of those
dependencies for the CONFIG_*s and only recompiles what is needed. Perhaps 
this infrastructure could be reused.
