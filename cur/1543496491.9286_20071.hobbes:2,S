Being someone who works with Trusted OSes every day, I'd say 
I'd like to see both.  That way it might be possible in the future
to create a B1+ secure system based on linux, but linux can still
operate as a "vanilla unix" OS. 
So I see now three security models.
1.) vanilla unix
2.) Linux improved security
3.) typical Trusted OS security.
I strongly agree with the usefullness of number 2.
But I see more usefullness in number 3 than you do.

Well maybe it would be good to have the an underlying privilege mechanism
in place that would support all three models.  Which is what I think
I'm advocating, by describing the privilege sets to such an extent as 
I have.

I'm all for two privilege sets on the file, no matter where it goes,
this would also make it easier to implement option number 3 above.
Call them forced and allowed, use forced like your current set
in the ELF header, then use "allowed" as the ones you're allowed to 
drop.  This way we can still implement option number 3 (as a B1+ option)
easier already having support forced, and allowed file capability sets in the 
kernel (even if they are used slightly differently).
