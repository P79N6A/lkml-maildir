yes.

I'll upload an aa4, then the future 9999_z-get_user_pages_pte_pin-2 will
included every known fix to get_user_pages. I hope it's the same for
you. I've a set of incremental fixes, and I'll join all of them together
in 9999_z-get_user_pages_pte_pin-2 (the PageReserved fix will get mixed
into it too, I hope that's not too confusing, the idea is that such
patch will fix all issues in get_user_pages in 2.4).
