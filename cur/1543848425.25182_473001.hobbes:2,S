I support Russells NAK but for another reason. You can't use printk in
the paths of a serial driver that may be the console. There is already a
whole ordering issue here and I'm not convinced it is handled correctly
reviewing the diff. Printks will make it worse in any driver (and waste
memory on handling impossible untestable situations that don't appen)
The printk case and serial first ordering want fixing correctly because
serial console is about the only sane way to debug resume in the first
place.
