Hi Pierre,
I have a 1GB SanDisk SD card here which linux does not recognize.
Looking at the MMC debug output, I see the MMC core repeatedly
issues CMD55/CMD41 commands (which all succeed!) then stops
after 100 times.  In sd_ops.c the code checks for a bit to get set.
My question is, what exactly is this bit supposed to indicate?
Thanks,
	Manuel Lauss
