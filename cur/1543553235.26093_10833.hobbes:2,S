Sure. Infact all the kernel (modules included) runs in ring 0 sharing the same
part of VM and - as everybody knows - a bug in a driver (or in khttpd or tux)
can crash the kernel.
But you can't destabilize the whole system when a bug in apache triggers (that
would happen with a ring 0 linux instead, and yes, with "linux" Jeff meant the
whole system, not just the kernel).
