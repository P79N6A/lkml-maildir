Martin,
Thank you for getting the fix going and sending me this patch which I applid on 2.5.66.
The problem is resolved:
  .config: CONFIG_NE2000=m
  Tested:
    network start on boot: 		OK
    several network restart:		OK
    rmmod ne 8390; network start:	OK
    several network restart:		OK
I like also to thank Adam Belay for getting this fixed.
Best Regards
Michael
