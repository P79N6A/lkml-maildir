Aww, why not? ;)

It seems dm-crypt was meant to overcome the problems with loop against block
devices.  If it uses another format, it would loose that ability to be a
replacement, and unless there are shortcomings in the format, why should
there be a change?
Also, while cryptoloop on block devices may be bass ackwards to get
encryption (use a driver meant to turn files into block devices on another
block device since there is now crypto tied into it...), if there's another
format, won't that data become inaccessable unless it's in a block device,
or do you get the dm-crypt -> loop -> file in the case a dm-crypt image gets
copied to a file?
