We're talking about 2.5.

Partly.  We've been through that in pretty good detail.  There are 
combinations of hardware and kernel versions that happen to be pretty good at 
running sound, that doesn't mean the problem is dealt with so that corner 
cases don't come up.  A 99% solution is not good enough, that still will 
leave 10,000's of Linux users with poor sound performance.
Zinf does things correctly: it has a big buffer and it tries to set an 
elevated priority for its sound servicing thread.  With 2.5, that isn't 
enough, and Con's tweaking isn't enough.  And that's not wrong, because the 
kernel *should not* try to identify realtime threads automagically.
Zinf could go further and try to set a posix realtime scheduling mode, but 
that attempt would be blocked by the root requirement for realtime 
scheduling, which is ihmo due to braindamage in the definition of the posix 
realtime scheduling modes.  This last we *can* fix in the kernel, by creating 
a new realtime scheduling mode that is sane enough to be used by normal 
users.  Then sound applications would need to be changed to use it, which 
really is no big deal.
In the meantime, a combination of Con's priority tweaks and user-initiated 
nice works well.

That's just fiddling, it doesn't deal with the basic problem.  Anyway, big 
buffers have their own annoyances.  Have you tried the graphic equalizer in 
xmms lately?  A one second lag on slider adjustment is not nice.
