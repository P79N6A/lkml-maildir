Actually, this isn't the case.  asm() alone don't trigger this.  There
are far too many of them in use.  And there never has been a reported
problem.  Only trampolines etc cause gcc to automatically request the X
flag to be set.  In case an asm() indeed causes problems the user can
pass the --execstack option to the linker.
It's all explained in
