These are the same, no?

I beg to differ on the "intrusive": except for needed structs and 
functions, which are totally orthogonal with the rest of git, it only 
touches fn_out_consume(), builtin_diff() and in an obvious way, 
diff_opt_parse() and struct diff_options.
So the real impact is pretty low and well contained.
Besides, I really use it often -- you should try it! Call me blind, but 
very often I cannot spot the differences (in the unified diff) when they 
are minor, especially when there was just a typo in the documentation. You 
could now say that I should not care about it, then, but if _I_ made the 
mistake, I want to learn from it.
Of course, if you really hate what it does, I will happily carry it in my 
personal repository; I _need_ it.
Ciao,
Dscho
