   You can certainly add select support to a proc file. It is
   doable. Odd but doable.
Odd, however it could be quite useful for /proc/${pid}
It might even lead to a nice solution to the problem of debugging
threaded applications.  Here a lot of the problems with gdb getting
things right have to do with reparenting and how thread libraries
implement things internally, signals, what have you.
When you can do selects on /proc/${pid}/debug or whatever, a lot of
the "what should we do if xxx" questions then have answers.
