CLOCK-Pro seems the most promising algorithm, because it can
act well both as a first level cache (operating system running
applications) and as a second level cache (operating system
running as a file server), because it tracks both recency and
frequency well.
However, there are a few unanswered questions on clock-pro.
The big one is how we are to do some background aging in a
clock-pro system, so referenced bits don't just pile up when
the VM has enough memory - otherwise we might not know the
right pages to evict when a new process starts up and starts
allocating lots of memory.
At least we've solved the problems of keeping track of the
recently evicted pages in a cheap way, and balancing the
pressure/hotness of different caches against each other.
