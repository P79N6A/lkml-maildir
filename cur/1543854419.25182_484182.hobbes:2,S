Hi Russell,
if I take out the patches to parport_cs and serial_cs,
leaving in only the patch to "pdaudiocf" our SP230 card
no longer works - it does not lock up the kernel, admittedly,
and the serial only card does works, but we would like
all are cards to just work.
ALSO, I have found no way to force a particular 16-bit
pcmcia card to be handled by a particular module in a
similar way to the USB generic serial driver module
parameter. Have I misssed the obvious? Or is that a
desirable feature that have been taken out of the David
Hinds original implementation?
