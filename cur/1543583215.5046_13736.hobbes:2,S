Not that I've seen. There may be a C89 spec. Somebody was checking
for POSIX conformance in the kernel API. I don't know if anybody
is doing that anymore.
Looking at various documentation, I see things like "usually -1
indicates error...".  This probably means that "anything goes",
which is absurd, but probable. At one time you could get bludgeoned
for writing an ioctl() that returned anything but 0 and -1. Now,
maybe anything goes.
