Hindsight:  had you used persistent superblocks, this would not have
been a problem.  The kernel would know the correct ordering from the
superblocks, not the device names.
Solution 1: Write to the RAID mailing list and have one of the mdadm
gurus give you a one-liner to initialize the array with the proper
ordering.
Solution 2: Edit your /etc/raidtab to reflect the new device naming and
run raidstart.
If you start up the array with a bad ordering, no amount of magic is
going to bring back you data (after parity has been "reconstructed" on
various chunks of your existing data).
