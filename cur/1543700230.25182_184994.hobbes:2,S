My Matrox-framebuffer is not working properly. Build direct into the
kernel, the monitor will be black with some stripes at startup, just the
reset button works.
Build as a modules, the same happens if I load the module.
The make xconfig script also advice me to compile some 8,16,24 and 32 bpp
packed pixel too, but I cant find them in the 2.6 kernel configuration
