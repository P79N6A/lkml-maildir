it may very well be that most drivers don't complain about reading past
the end of the device.
some have suggested that the end_index computation at the top of
generic_file_readahead is incorrect.  that is not beyond the pale, and i
can take a look at that.
this calculation:
        end_index = inode->i_size >> PAGE_CACHE_SHIFT;
i think the case where there are bytes in that last page work as i
intended.  the problem is that sometimes the end_index value points to a
page with zero bytes (for example when the file is exactly an integral
number of pages in length; this is always the case for most devices).
i_size = 4095   end_index = 0   total_pages_in_file = 1
i_size = 4096   end_index = 1   total_pages_in_file = 1
i_size = 4097   end_index = 1   total_pages_in_file = 2
so right at the boundary we have a little problem.

understood, and thanks for the giving me the opportunity to try to help
you fix it.

i don't have either of those.  can anyone who is willing to test a patch
on this hardware e-mail me so we can try this out?
