With most device interrupts, additional spurious ones don't cause any
malfunction because the driver's handler checks whether the device
actually has a condition pending.
This is the basis of shared interrupts, of course.
Is there any way we can check the timer itself to see whether an
interrupt was caused by it, so that spurious timer interrupts are ignored?
