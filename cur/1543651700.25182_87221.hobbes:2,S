From memory that's to handle cache line length. I seem to remember back in
the 486 days setting my flags explicitly for anything which might be the
target of a branch. However, my recollection is that things were put on a
quadbyte, not position 16.
You can set the placement of loops, functions, and something else to be
mod any power of two, I believe.
I still run routers on one 486 and a boatload of Cyrix and similar clones.
