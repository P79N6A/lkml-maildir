Subject: [PATCH retry] namespace.c: fix race in mark_mounts_for_expiry()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

One more try.  I hope everybody's happy now.
This patch fixes a race found by Ram in mark_mounts_for_expiry() in
fs/namespace.c.
The bug can only be triggered with simultaneous exiting of a process
having a private namespace, and expiry of a mount from within that
namespace.  It's practically impossible to trigger, and I haven't even
tried.  But still, a bug is a bug.
The race happens when put_namespace() is called by another task, while
mark_mounts_for_expiry() is between atomic_read() and get_namespace().
In that case get_namespace() will be called on an already dead
namespace with unforeseeable results.
The solution is to use atomic_dec_and_lock() in put_namespace() as
suggested by Al Viro.
This is a mininal fix, really only serving as a reminder, that this
usage of mnt_namespace is ugly and needs to be properly cleaned up.
