I work on a Power-PC PCI linux architecture and I'm not sure of the
actual implementation of theses functions in this architecture.
The Power-PC is a big-endian processor and theses functions are in the
actual code implemented as doing byte
swapping to change the endianess of data. A lot of linux driver rely on
the fact that theses functions doesn't swap data.
In my opinion changing theses functions to copy data as-is in the
Power-PC allows to get more driver in a working state
without too much code change. Is this the right thing ?, and, is there a
linux specification to explain how to make a driver
working in little-endian and big endian environment properly.
