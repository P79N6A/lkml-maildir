Comparing the reliability of the hash function to the reliability of
hardware is an apples to oranges comparison.  Far more interesting
would be to compare the correlation between reliability of each of
them to the input data.
I.E.:
The hash function scores 100% on this - certain patters will _always_
trigger a fault.  Once you find a way to make it corrupt data, it will
be 100% reproducable using the same dataset.
The hardware will typically score less than 100% - certain patterns of
data in memory are more likely to make a weak RAM chip flip a bit, we
have seen many examples of that where a machine dies quickly running
memtest86, but will run Linux apparently fine for at least a while.
However, other things such as the temperature affect this.  It's rare
to find a memory access pattern that will 100% reliably lock up a
machine in exactly the same way.
John.
