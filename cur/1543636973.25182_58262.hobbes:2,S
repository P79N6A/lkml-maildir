Ok, I'll bite. Why? Note: I'm not necessarily saying I disagree, just that I 
don't know what "test" you are applying to determine whether stuf should be 
in or out?
Personally, my test is "does it provide useful information to a program or to 
a user that is not available in other ways, or where the other ways require 
an ioctl interface". 
I insert the second phrase because I do like the general principle that in 
Unix you read and write stuff to files, and procfs does provide a lot of 
extra scope for that to happen.
There is an obvious problem with formats, but that is a specification and 
discipline issue between the various developers, and not something that is 
wrong with procfs as such.
