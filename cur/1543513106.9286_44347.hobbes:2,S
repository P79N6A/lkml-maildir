It's not related.  Also, it's not an error; if you look closely, the "error" 
strings are *arguments* to the command.
It's just the X server telling you that it is executing a command.  Said 
command has arguments that cause it to document its log output *if it has 
any*, which it apparently doesn't because the "Errors from" line only occurs 
as an argument and not by itself.
As for the "xinit: connection to X server lost", that usually indicates that 
you used CTRL-ALT-BackSpace to abort the X server (although it *could* 
indicate the server died for some other reason).
In any case, X server problems are not appropriate for linux-kernel; X 
doesn't have a kernnel component.

    We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
