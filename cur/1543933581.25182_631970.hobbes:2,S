It is - [comments removed for clarity]:
struct kernel_vm86_struct {
         struct kernel_vm86_regs regs;
#define VM86_TSS_ESP0 flags
         unsigned long flags;
         unsigned long screen_bitmap;
         unsigned long cpu_type;
         struct revectored_struct int_revectored;
         struct revectored_struct int21_revectored;
         struct vm86plus_info_struct vm86plus;
         struct pt_regs *regs32;
};
