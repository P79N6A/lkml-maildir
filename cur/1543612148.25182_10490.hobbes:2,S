We can get a panic() call (and remove the ugly #ifdef's) with
something like this:
in some .h file:
#ifdef DEVEXIT_LINKED
#define DEVEXIT_FUNC(a) (a)
#else
void panic_exit_code();
#define DEVEXIT_FUNC(a) ((typeof((a)) *)panic_exit_code)
#endif
in some .c file:
#ifndef DEVEXIT_LINKED
void panic_exit_code()
{
   panic("__exit code called");
}
#endif
change the drivers like this:
#ifdef DEVEXIT_LINKED
     remove:         firestream_remove_one,
#endif
to this:
     remove:         DEVEXIT_FUNC(firestream_remove_one),
Eric
