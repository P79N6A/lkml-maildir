Hi,
While testing with hotplugging cpus today, I've came across a stack
trace generated by lockdep. The reason for that is that
do_boot_cpu() in smpboot_64.c ends up initializing a struct work_struct
variable in the stack.
These patches fix this by making it static. a per-cpu variable is choosen,
since, to the best of my knowledge, nothing prevents two cpus going up
at the same time, and so a single static c_idle won't do.
I separated it in two patches to better isolate the change. The first patch
just paves the way, by turning access to c_idle into pointer dereferences.
The second one does the real work.
Thanks
