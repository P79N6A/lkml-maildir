This should create a symlink for the serial device in the first slot:
  KERNEL="ttyUSB*", SUBSYSTEMS=="pcmcia", KERNELS=="0.0",
SYMLINK+="serial-slot0"
You find the keys used with udevinfo. Here is an example for a PCMCIA
CF Memory card:
  udevinfo --attribute-walk --name hda4
  ...
  looking at device '/block/hda/hda4':
    KERNEL=="hda4"
    SUBSYSTEM=="block"
  ...
  looking at parent device '/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1e.0/0000:04:00.0/0.0':
    KERNELS=="0.0"
    SUBSYSTEMS=="pcmcia"
    DRIVERS=="ide-cs"
  ...
  looking at parent device '/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1e.0/0000:04:00.0':
    KERNELS=="0000:04:00.0"
    SUBSYSTEMS=="pci"
    DRIVERS=="yenta_cardbus"
  ...
