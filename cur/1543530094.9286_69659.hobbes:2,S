   Swap isn't necessary. Swap is just a cheap and slow alternative to RAM
chips, that's why most people use it, hoping mostly inactive parts of
memory have to be implemented as swap, but swap isn't necessary. It is
quite possible to run production Linux systems without any swap. Been
there, done that.
