Well, pm-utils seems to be a bunch of shell scripts that run some addtional
utilities, such as vbetool, to actually do the quirks.  In s2ram we have all
these additional utilities put together in one package and you need not
use the whiltelist it contains.  You can just very well make pm-utils use
s2ram for doing the low-level work, just build the appropriate command line
for it on the basis of the HAL whitelist.
Frankly, I don't see any conflict between pm-utils and s2ram at a technical
level.
Thanks,
