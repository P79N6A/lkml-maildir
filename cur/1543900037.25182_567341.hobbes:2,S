There are many situations where patching the kernel involves adding a new
item to a list, such as:
- adding a makefile line
- adding a new #include
- adding a new Kconfig entry
- adding a new PCI ID
- adding a record to feature-removal.txt
- adding a new sysctl table entry
- etc
Of course, everyone just sticks the new entry at the end of the existing
entries.  This strategy carefully maximises the opportunity for patch
rejects and leads to unhappiness.
Most of these lists are unordered anyway, so inserting the new item at a
randomly-chosen position is a better approach than just appending it.
