Well, compatibility for 64bits kernel and 32bits userland it not
the first priority, so to say.

Oh.  Nice thing, I just discovered personality(2) stuff ;)
Thank you very much for the pointer!
Except of some.. interesting stuff here.  It does not quite work as
*I*'d expect (not to say it's wrong but just unexpected).  Namely,
when setarch is also 32bits, it can't execute anything after setting
ADDR_LIMIT_3GB (or PER_LINUX32_3GB).  execve(2) returns immediately
with EFAULT error.  But if doing the same from a 64bit executable,
it all works as expected.  Or when doing the same from 32bit exe
running on a 32bit kernel.  I.e. the only problematic case for
personality(PER_LINUX32_3GB) call is 32bit userspace on 64bit kernel.
personality(PER_LINUX32_3GB)            = 0
execve("/bin/echo", ["/bin/echo", "foo"], [/* 13 vars */]) = -1 EFAULT (Bad address)
Should it work? ;)
For now, it is running correctly when using a 64bits setarch executable
in-between.  Sure it will not work anymore if I'll reboot into 32bits
kernel ;)  (I run 64bits now because I'm trying to move data between
two databases, one old 32bits and another is 64 bits).
Thank you!
