eh, how do you figure?
A signal can clearly cause the abort-related functions to delay far 
shorter than the driver wishes.
The msleep_interruptible() in arcmsr_wait_msgint_ready() probably isn't 
fatal -- unless it's there to ensure the hardware isn't pounded -- but 
again, a signal can cause a CPU-wasting busy loop that could last for 
quite a while (in CPU terms).
