Subject: does udev support sw raid0?

Hello list,
I'm trying to setup my box to use udev but I'm stuck.
My /home partition is on a software raid0. Using devfs, I have no problems. I 
can "mount /dev/md/0 /home" and I'm done, but udev seems to ignore raid0 
completely. md and raid0 modules are loaded but there're no md/raid devices 
on /dev.
So what's the problem here? Does udev support sw raid0 devices? Or the other 
way around, does sw raid0 support udev?
Many thanks in advance,
Norberto
