Slightly delayed, but here is loop-5. It's against 2.4.2-pre4, as
testing on 2.4.1-ac19 showed other problems (oom killer would kill
dbench or bash before it could finish...). I'll take a look at ac19
next. Changes since loop-4:
o Make sure loop_thread is up. A mount -o loop could sometimes sneak
  in a request before the helper thread was started. (me)
o Remove all the backing file setup, count on get_file just
  holding a reference to it. (Neil Brown)
o Remove fs/buffer.c:wakeup_bdflush work around. loop doesn't block
  on requests, so it shouldn't be needed.
