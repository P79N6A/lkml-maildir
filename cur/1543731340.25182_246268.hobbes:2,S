One incredibly burning question sits before me.  Why do you spend such 
an exorbitant amount of energy wailing and hand waving over this instead 
of coming up with a solution?  You're so hellbent on making a big stink 
out of it instead of what seems to be a simple issue.  Since the driver 
already exists in multiple parts, use the existing works to come up with 
a solution.  I know Nemosoft loves his work and nobody likes getting 
pushed away.  But if the approach is wrong, find a solution that is right.
Honestly, it's pretty annoying to see people hellbent on the ruckus 
itself with little or no thought to a solution.
Make sure that gets into the editorials too.
