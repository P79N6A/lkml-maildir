I have done something similar to this in LinuxBIOS, perhaps a
description of that will spark ideas.  
In the enumeration phase I look at the vendor+device id and then hdr
type to assign methods.  The methods I have are:
scan_bus,
read_bases,
write_bases.
Then for all children of a bus that have a scan_bus function I
recurse.  This fits in very naturally with devices not necessarily
being pci devices.
When it comes time to assign pci resources I call the read_bases
method to get the size and possibly fixed location of the resource.  I
play with my data structures to get a non conflicting set of resources
and then I call write_bases on each device to write the resource
assignments to the actual device.
The setup works well enough that I don't have to differentiation later
in the code between pci busses and normal pci devices.
I have not had to push beyond the standard pci devices yet, but I
don't think I have missed anything that would cause me problems.
Linus is this the kind of thing you are thinking of?
