Hello,
I am posting again because I am not sure my first email went out.
I am under the feeling that there is some memory leakage in the kernel.
I let my 2.2.0 final box running for 4 days. It acts as a NFS server,
NFS client, ypbind client.
I did some compilation locally on the hard disk, from clients, and on
a server (so, basically local accesses, remote read and write accesses).
From around 5 Mb upon start up, I am now using more than 21 Mb. The
same box in the same condition with 2.0.36 is running for weeks and
is around 10 Mb. The difference is with the use of knfsd (version of
december) instead of the userland nfs serveur.
Things (memory leakage) were worst in the 2.1.129 kernel, and have
improved greatly, but it still seems to be little work to be done.
However, NFS in 2.2.x kernels is just so fast. Nice job.
A+,
