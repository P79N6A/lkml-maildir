I think this is a very important point, and one I agree with.  I tend to
let my distribution handle stuff like python.  now, I use RedHat's
on-going devel, RawHide. it is not using python2.  in fact, since
switching to python2 may break old stuff, I don't expect python2 until
8.0. that wont be for 9 months.  90% of RedHat's configuration tools, et
al, are written in python1 and they just are not going to change on
someone's whim.
im not installing python2 from source just so i can run some new config
utility.
(on another note, about the coexist issue: am i going to have a python
and python2 binary? so now the config tool will find which to use, ala
the kgcc mess? great)
