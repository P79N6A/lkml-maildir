Hi Jeff-

If/when we do set PCI_CACHE_LINE_SIZE, please don't
set it to a hard-coded, inline constant, like 8 (e.g.),
like some drivers do.
Please use something like (PCI_CACHE_LINE_SIZE / 4)
instead.  ["/ 4" to convert bytes to "dwords" or
whatever, since the PCI_CACHE_LINE_SIZE register
is in 4-byte units.]
