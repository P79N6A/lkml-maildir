Release 1.1.7 of jfsutils was made available today.
This release include the following changes to the utilities:
    - --replay_journal_only should not clear FM_DIRTY
    - Ensure changes to disk occur in the proper order
    - Message corrections
    - Directory Index Table corrections for big-endian systems.
The last of these is the most critical.  Anyone using version 1.1.6 on a
big-endian system (i.e. ppc64) should update to version 1.1.7.
