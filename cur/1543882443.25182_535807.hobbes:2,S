Ok.  I'm not in a position to do this work.  But I will keep it in
mind and look at it.

Thanks for the clarification.
So we do have a clear problem that we do not have generic support for
large sector sizes residing in the page cache.
There is one place where this is a direct effect fs/block_dev.c
We have an indirect affect in the filesystems because there a few
bits of generic support missing and there is no linux convention
on how to handle this case.
I expect if we can enhance fs/block_dev.c to handle this case the
other parts will fall out naturally.
