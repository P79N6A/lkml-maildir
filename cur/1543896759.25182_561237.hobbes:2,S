As I know, there are a lot of standalone kernel developer in China. They 
write device drivers for their chips or iptables modules for their  
linux based network devices. They send source files to their customers 
or publish them on web but seldom do anything to make the codes into 
kernel source tree. The usual reason  is they do not know how to 
communicate and work with the Linux kernel development community. People 
will have more chance to read these documentation  if we merge them to 
the kernel source tree.
