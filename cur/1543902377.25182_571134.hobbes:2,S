Linux-VServer patch adds 2 new flags: barrier and iunlink.
With recent changes in -git (filestreams), XFS now lacks di_flags bits
to add these.
iunlink flag adds Copy-on-Write semantics to hard links, while barrier
flag signifies a filesystem barrier no virtual context can pass.
I'd like to know how to possibly resolve this problem w/o negatively
impacting performance (especially of iunlink) or changing on-disc
format in an incompatible way, as well as being more future-proof.
