I'm getting the
make: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 139
problem with kernel 2.6.6.  It works fine on one of my computer, but not
the other.
The full line is
ld -m elf_i386  -T arch/i386/kernel/vmlinux.lds.s

Both are using gcc 2.95.3.  Both are using binutils version
2.14.90.0.8.  Both have the same module-init-tools version.  Etc., etc.,
etc.
The only difference is on the nonworking one, the processor type is
Pentium M instead of Pentium 4, and I'm using different video and
ethernet drivers because the two machines have different video and
ethernet cards :P.  The nonworking one is a laptop, if that makes a
difference.  I've got the enhanced SpeedStep option enabled for it.
I found a lot of stuff on Google about this problem, but a lot of it is
old and/or just tells you to upgrade to a 2.14 of binutils, which I
have.  I get this error if I use gcc3 as well.
