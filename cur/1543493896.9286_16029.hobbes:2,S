Subject: ppp over half duplex line/modem ?

a friend has some half duplex radio modems (connected to RS232 serial line) 
and he'd like to use them as ppp link between two linkx boxes. it's not necessary
to switch between transmit/receive, but it can't use both channels at the same time.
can ppp be used with half duplex modems ?  
or is there any protocol layer (HDLC or similar) which allows half duplex
connections and which can be directly used with ppp (or similar)  ?
thanks for any hint,
Harald
