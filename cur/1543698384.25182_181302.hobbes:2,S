Thats not the issue... The issue is if the machine survives or crashes.
Again, it locks up for quite some time but it always comes back. And you
get a "hda lost interrupt" message in dmesg.
If we all have that, and deadlock when using the amd/nvidia driver..
then we know that that might be the fault. The machine still locks for a
while so, it's not just the ide, but it might be a good place to start.
