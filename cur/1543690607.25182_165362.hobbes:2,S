When I was working on it, I wrote a patch that at every context switch
used to register cycle counter timestamp, pid and other things (this per
CPU), with the number of samples configurable. This helped me a lot not
only to understand latencies, but also process migrations (usefull for
balancing thingies). There was a /dev/something where you could collect
samples and analyze them. It'd nice to have something like that for 2.6.
