Will this patchset fix/suppress the "Non-Fatal Error PCI Express B"
messages I see with the E7525 edac?
I am running 2.6.16 (or more specific FC5 2.6.16-1.2111) with seems to
already include this version:
MC: drivers/edac/edac_mc.c version edac_mc  Ver: 2.0.0 May  4 2006
This version still floods my syslog with "Non-Fatal Error...." messages.
