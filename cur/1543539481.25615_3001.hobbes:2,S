Well.. Followed the discussion, never responded, but there is a first time
or everything :
- Calling named at each other isn't the way to go. We all make
  mistakes. People who believe they don't make any probably work at
Microsoft :-))
- Killing a drive with a ATAPI command sounds bad.. The question is : Do
  we need this 'feature' in normal operation ?? No ?? Kill it.
If Andre believes the feature is wrong : Make a patch that kill's it, and
get it in the main stream kernel. Simple. He's the IDE specialist, most of
us are not.
I suggest we kill this thread. I hate flame wars.
