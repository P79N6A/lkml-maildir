I'm seeing the same on my Evo800c, I think it's very much
ACPI-related, as logging out of gnome and back in worked before i got
a newer ACPI-patch on 2.4. Currently on 2.4.20 with ACPI patch from
early January.
Planning on testing out the latest ACPI-patch dates February 18th
along with 2.4.21-pre4 now; and tinker a bit with the DSDT to make it
usefull; I'll let you know how it works out.
