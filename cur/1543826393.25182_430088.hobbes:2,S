ok, at least I managed to get a Dir.Length > 0 using long or short "ad"
instead of inicb -- whatever that means. "AD" like "allocation descriptor"?
long or short ADs, or ADs in the INICB? what exactly does that mean?
so:
        mkudffs --ad=long --noefe 24M
or:     mkudffs --ad=short --noefe 24M
will get me a step further, but UDFFindFile will now fail at some other place.
kind regards,
