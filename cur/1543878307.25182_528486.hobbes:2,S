Good catch.  daemonize must die!

Yes.  We can.

We would have user visible changes when we changed to ktrhead_create anyway,
and it's none of user space's business so certainly.

If we are going to do something to copy_process and the like let's take
this one step farther.  Let's pass in the value of the task to copy.
Then we can add a wrapper around copy_process to build kernel_thread
something like:
struct task_struct *__kernel_thread(int (*fn)(void *), void * arg,
				    unsigned long flags)
{
	struct task_struct *task;
	struct pt_regs regs, *reg;
        reg = kernel_thread_regs(&regs, fn, arg);
	task = copy_process(&init_task, flags, 0, reg, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0);
	if (!IS_ERR(task))
		wake_up_new_task(task, flags);
	return task;
}
long kernel_thread(int (*fn)(void *), void * arg, unsigned long flags)
{
	struct task_struct *task;
	task = __kernel_thread(fn, arg, flags);
        if (IS_ERR(task))
        	return PTR_ERR(task);
	return task->pid;               
}
After that daemonize just becomes:
void daemonize(const char *name, ...)
{
	va_list args;
	va_start(args, name);
	vsnprintf(current->comm, sizeof(current->comm), name, args);
	va_end(args);
}
And kthread_create becomes:
struct task_struct *kthread_create(int (*threadfn)(void *data),
				   void *data,
				   const char namefmt[],
				   ...)
{
	struct kthread_create_info create;
	struct task_struct *task;
	create.threadfn = threadfn;
	create.data = data;
	/* We want our own signal handler (we take no signals by default). */
        task = __kernel_thread(kthread, create, CLONE_FS | CLONE_FILES | SIGCHLD);
	if (!IS_ERR(task)) {
		va_list args;
		va_start(args, namefmt);
		vsnprintf(task->comm, sizeof(task->comm),  namefmt, args);
		va_end(args);
	}
        return task;
}
If we are willing to go that far.  I think it is worth it to touch the
architecture specific code.  As that removes an unnecessary wait
queue, and ensures that kernel threads always start with a consistent
state.  So it is a performance, scalability and simplicity boost.
Otherwise we should just put the code in the callers of kernel_thread
like we do today.
I don't have the energy to rework all of th architecture or even a
noticeable fraction of them right now.  I have to much on my plate.
A non-architecture specific solution looks like a fairly simple
patch and I might get around to it one of these times..
