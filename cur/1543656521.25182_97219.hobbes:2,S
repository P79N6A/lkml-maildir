Well, burnK7 crashes this system pretty easily (few minutes).  I also 
get "254" error codes from it which apparently indicate an 
"integer/memory error".
I've been trying to run "sensors" (from lm_sensors) to see if I can see 
and voltage or temp issues while burnK7 is running, but I'm skeptical 
that the temp readings are correct as they aren't moving much.
