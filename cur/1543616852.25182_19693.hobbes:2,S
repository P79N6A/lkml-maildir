If I have to have 2000 pages and 2000 file handles for 2000 locks I've
kind of lost interest. read/write syscalls take offsets. I can pread/pwrite
a lock in a set of locks. The only reason for using an fd I can see is so
you can poll on a lock. All the other neatness issues are wrapped in the
library support code anyway.

Read my old mail you need neither a hash table or a tree. You just need
the required shadow object
	offset = addr - vma->vm_start;
	offset /= sizeof(struct user_lock);
	lock = ((struct lock *)vma->vm_private_data)[offset];
