It should make absolutely no odds.

That actually looks like what is needed

The kill_fasync code starts
	while(fa)
so it checks this. For that oops trace to be right it would imply someone
zapped the list. The list is only changed by fasync_helper. That locks the
list when doing the two critical updates for adding/removing an entry and
seems to have a small race. I find it hard to believe this is what is going
on but unless I am missing something
	save_flags(flags);
        cli();
	*fp = fa->fa_next;
  	restore_flags(flags);
        kfree(fa);
        return 1;
is safe even SMP since the cli/restore_flags means that we cannot be part
way down a queue walk when the entry is freed.
