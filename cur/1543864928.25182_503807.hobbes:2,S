Sure, that much is obvious.  I was hoping to see what FPU state  
juggling actually requires.  I'm operating under the assumption that  
it won't be *terrible*.

Yeah.  A first-pass approximation might be to have threads with asys  
system calls grouped by priority.  Leaving all that priority handling  
to the *task* scheduler, instead of the dirt-stupid fibril  
"scheduler", would be great.  If we can get away with it.  I don't  
have a good feeling for what portion of the world actually cares  
about this, or to what degree.
