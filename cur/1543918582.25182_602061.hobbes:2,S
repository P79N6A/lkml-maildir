This looks a lot better! I don't mind seperating the block bits, when we
get the whole bunch in there. Just seemed overly silly and complicated
to do it for just one ioctl command. When you are happy with this patch,
I'll add it to the pending block stuff for 2.6.24. The blktrace fix
isn't a regression so need not go into 2.6.23.
It seems some bits are missing though (like BLKTRACESETUP32), did you
send the whole thing?

Always nice to find bugs when doing cleanups ;-)
