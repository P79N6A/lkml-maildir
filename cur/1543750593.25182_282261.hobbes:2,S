Write ordering trouble shouldn't crash the kernel, the way I
understand it.  Your journalled fs could be lost/inconsistent 
if the machine crashes for other reasons, due to bad write
ordering.  But the ordering trouble shouldn't cause a crash,
and all should be fine as soon as all the writes complete
without other incidents.
