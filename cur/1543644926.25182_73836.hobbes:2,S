Hmm... I just tried biult 2.4.19 with the ext3 patch on my UP P3
machine, using GCC 3.2, and I wasn't able to replicate your problem.
(This was using Debian's gcc 3.2.1-0pre2 release from testing.)
What was the precise GCC 3.2 version you were using, and for what
architecture were you compiling for?  As I recall P3 kernels should
run on Athlons, if memory serves me correctly.  (I don't have any
Athlons at home, so if it's an Athlon-specific code generation bug,
I'll have problems replicating it.)  Could you try compiling a kernel
for the P3 architecture using GCC 3.2, and see whether or not the
problem is there?  This is just a shot in the dark, but....
