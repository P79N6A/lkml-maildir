Andrea,  the 2.4 wakeup code is only O(1) if called from process
context. For networking, where it is called from softirq context
it is O(N).
The waitqueue patch which I did for kumon@fujitsu does O(1) from
all contexts as well as LIFO and the results are fairly clear.
Here the 'server' just forks a bunch of children which sit
in accept().  The 'client' opens and closes the connection
as fast as it can, 10,000 times. All processes run on localhost:

Easy to explain.  5 seconds / 1000 servers / 10,000 iterations
is 500nSecs per loop in __wake_up_common.  I figure that loop
has three misses and probably a TLB reload.
However the Apache performance was increased by 10% irrespective
of the number of servers - from 3 to 150.  Presumably the effect
of the LIFO.
Frankly, the fact that we fall from 9100 conn/sec to 5500 when
there are 100 processes waiting on a socket doesn't seem
particularly important to me - this is a mistuned server.
I suggest that we not sweat it.
But the patch is a better implementation, so expect to hear more
about it when the time is appropriate :)  (It currently does
LIFO for semaphores as well which, as you have explained is
wrong.   Will fix.)

hmm.. Has this been changed in 2.4?  The performance is the same.
