That was Ying Huang's suggestion, so he might be best able to help
you. But I see you haven't included him in the recipient list of
your mail.

Perhaps it would be better to use a current kernel? It's always an
additional difficulty if one has to go back in history.

I have no idea. As I said, I have used a different interface and
this one is essentially undocumented. If I had to use it I would
probably try to follow the flow of control from the
serio_register_driver() call in sermouse_init() in order to see
where the .connect method ends up being called. But again, Ying
Huang was the one who suggested that interface, so hopefully he
might be able to tell you more.
