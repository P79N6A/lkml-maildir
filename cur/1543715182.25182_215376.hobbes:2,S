Reading SPAMCOP pages I think they are most unwilling to make
any exceptions.  Per this document:
   
http://www.spamcop.net/fom-serve/cache/298.html
The only way to handle this is to have smarter people, who are always
vigilant enough to look deeply into the message headers and do realize
that some spam has leaked thru VGER's lists. They may report those 
_ONLY_ to VGER's postmaster (several people), who can (to an extent)
add keyword based filters to Majordomo.
Any single less savvy person receiving the list could still
accidentally get VGER again listed in a number of spam-block
lists.
Another would be to run the lists in fully CLOSED mode, which
would still let a bunch of viruses thru...  (filters are mostly
biting on those already, though.)  But it would be most nasty
mode in other forms...
