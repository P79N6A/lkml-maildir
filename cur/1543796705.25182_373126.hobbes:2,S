I meant "handled in the worst possible way by
the kernel developers".  It *is* possible to define
stable APIs and have them used successfully.
POSIX is not the greatest example, but it seems
to work OK.  I realize that drivers are more
tightly bound to the kernel than are libraries
or applications, but sheesh, this is not rocket
science.
