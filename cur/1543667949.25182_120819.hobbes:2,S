Ok, the file is there now.  Thanks.  One question though, is this expected
behavior from the MX700?
 $ ./logitech_applet 
001/002     046D/C506   C-BF16-MSE      MX700 Optical Mouse
Error getting cruise control setting from device : error sending control
message: Broken pipe   Cruise Control / Smart Scroll: 8 (Unexpected result)
Unexpected cruise value : 8
   Result: 8
   P6  = 20
   P0  = 3d
   P4  = 8b
   P5  = 4d Channel 2    Battery: 5
   P8  = d7
   P9  = f
   PB0 = 1
   PB1 = ee Two channel   800cpi support   No Horizontal Roller   Vertical
   Roller   8 buttons 
I assume this is because of the MX700 firmware bugs.  Other than that it does
what it is supposed to.
