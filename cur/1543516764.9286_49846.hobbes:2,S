In the current implementation, it (pci.c) scans for all devices at boot time.
I don't think it would be a big deal to modify the kernel to support hot-plug
devices, though there should probably be a notification mechanism set up so
that drivers are notified cleanly when the device has been (or is about to
be) removed.
I may work on this if there is enough demand for it.  Currently we're (at
my company) developing a CompactPCI device, and we have a CompactPCI
PC in house that could run Linux...  Is anybody else wanting such support?
