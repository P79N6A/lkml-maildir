You are absolutely right, I just want to add following note:
Most of the logical devices inside superio chips has standardized access methods.
One just need base address and index, that is all.
For such devices all infrastructure already exists in the provided superio core.
One just need to provide one logical device driver for it(like sc_gpio.c).
But, sometimes it really can be the situation, when logical device is not
obeyed to rules in the existing logical device driver(like GPIO in sc1100, which is
not superio logical device but is fitted design quite well), for such
cases there is also infrastructure in superio driver. For example scx.c -
it has it's own private GPIO logical device, which is "cloned" from the
"standard"(described in sc_gpio.c) logical device(clones actully have 
almost nothing in common).
Situation with device cloning is very unlikely according to various superio
chips I saw and read datasheets.
