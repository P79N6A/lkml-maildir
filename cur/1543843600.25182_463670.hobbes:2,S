But that's the whole point - if it's not integrated into a marker as
source code, it requires manual intervention for every bloody release
to do. "line 9 of sched.c" is a farcically stupid way of doing tags
on a dynamically moving project like the linux kernel.
Yes, that may work OK for something that is very static, like a distro
snapshot, but as a general mechanism, it's unsustainable and broken.
