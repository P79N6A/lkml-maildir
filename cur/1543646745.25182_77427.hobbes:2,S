But you didn't post your .config file, what options you
had enabled or disabled, what your hardwsre platform is,
an analysis of where the bloat is taking place, or any
other thing that would allow for anyone here to help you.
You've also been told that the VM is in that kernel (and
from what I understand it can't be removed) so you're using
a kernel which almost definitely isn't configured properly
for your hardware platform.
The GPL issue is important, but that's not the issue here :
LKML helps those who help themselves.  All you're doing is
whining and complaining, so I'm left with no reason NOT to
killfile you.
