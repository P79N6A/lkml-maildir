I am not on this list - I just wanted to confirm the existence of the problem
(found it by searching the ML archive)
Any kernel since 2.2.3 (which works as do builds previous to 2.2.3) at
least up to 2.2.9 (incl. 2.3.0) fails to invalidate at least e2fs buffers for
at least all Fujitsu MO drives (the vast majority of MOs). This really sucks
and the only workaround seems to be to always insert (and mount/umount) an
MSDOS formatted disk between two e2fs-formatted ones to force a flush in some
way.
I know of at least two systems showing this kind of behaviour. I will gladly
try to help debugging by answering any further inquiries about this problem by
email.

        Fionn
