Yes.  So the right answer there isn't to use a derivation but to say:
require X86 and PARPORT implies PARPORT_PC
unless X86==n suppress PARPORT_PC
which forces PARPORT_PC==y and makes the question invisible on X86 machines,
but leaves the question visible on all others.

The real point of audits is to instill fear, not to extract revenue;
the IRS aims at winning through intimidation and (thereby) getting
maximum voluntary compliance
