Dear diary, on Tue, Apr 26, 2005 at 05:24:22AM CEST, I got a letter
where Petr Baudis <pasky@ucw.cz> told me that...
>   here goes Cogito-0.8, my SCMish layer over Linus Torvald's git tree

I forgot to mention that you should really only upgrade if you feel
brave and are willing to do some testing; it is likely there are some
new bugs introduced by the renaming, some leftovers of the original
git-pasky stuff in some not-so-frequently called scripts, etc. I will
see how many bug reports will we get and how fast will the bugcount
drop; if things won't stabilize very quickly, I might release
git-pasky-0.7.1 with few obvious bugfixes.
(And don't write announcements at 4am.)
