Well, 8 might be too long but I wouldn't be able to read the code
with 2-chars tabs. Even on a large wall display.
4 chars, maybe, but I'm not sure. 8 chars is great except that the
lines are too short.
Obviously it's the space taken by indentation, the "real" line
length of ~ 70 chars (such as in this msg) is ok.
