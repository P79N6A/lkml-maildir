I watched the videos you posted. A ncie and quite clear improvement
with and without your logic. Cudos.
When you play around with it may I suggest a change to the display of
the memory information. I think it would be valuable to use a Hilbert
Curve to arange the pages into pixels. Like this:
# #  0  3
# #
###  1  2

  # #

I've drawn in allocations for 16, 8, 4, 5, 32 pages in that order in
the last one. The idea is to get near pages visually near in the
output and into an area instead of lines. Easier on the eye. It also
manages to always draw aligned order(x) blocks as squares or rectanges
(even or odd order).

You adjust group size with the number of groups total. You would not
use 1GB Huge Pages on a 2GB ram system. You could try 2MB groups. I
think for most current systems we are lucky there. 2MB groups fit
hardware support and give a large but not too large number of groups
to work with.
But you only need to stick to hardware suitable group sizes for huge
tlb support right? For better I/O and such you could have 512Kb groups
if that size gives a reasonable number of groups total.

Which is different from reserving a full group as it does not count
fragmented space as lost.

Not realy. I'm saying we should actively defragment mixed groups
during allocation and always as little as possible when a certain
level of external fragmentation is reached. A MIGRATE_MIXED sounds
like giving up completly if things get bad enough. Compare it to a
cheap network switch going into hub mode when its arp table runs full.
If you ever had that then you know how bad that is.

That is the type of group, not which one.

Put the uptime as sort key into each group header on creation or type
change. Then sort the partialy used groups by that key. A heap will do
fine and be fast.

Except that is never done so doesn't count.
