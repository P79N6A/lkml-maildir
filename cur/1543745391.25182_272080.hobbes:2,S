Someone have a pointer to a good technical overview, and details, of how 
specific locations of drivers are determined and used in these special 
directories?
for example, the below udevinfo command shows info from:
	to match the device for which the node will be created.
	looking at the device chain at
		'/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:07.0':
	====
	udevinfo  -p /sys/class/net/eth0/ -a
and several other locations.  how is the path determined? how are these 
numbers determined?  how do programs use this information to do their 
thing?  are these commonly known address/directories and if so how are 
the paths determined?
this is all darn new to me so please excuse any simple questions to you. 
  I have been reading the kernel source and its slow going.
Thanks,
