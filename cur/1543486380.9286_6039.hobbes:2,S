Subject: I found a misspelled word on your website...

I happened upon your web site and noticed that "receive" is misspelled (you
have it as "recieve").  The URL of the page is:
http://www.wcug.wwu.edu/lists/netdev/199708/msg00039.html
   
Sorry for making such a big deal of a simple misspelling; my therapist says
I have an obsessive-compulsive personality<g>. But these web pages seem to
live forever and this could be embarrassing.
When I find something like this on my website, I use a free utility that
helps me correct typos and make quick edits right in my browser.  It's
called JustEdit and you can get a free copy from www.download.com.
Good luck,
Chris
