Subject: [PATCH 2.5] invalid irqs accepted in serial pci driver
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Hi,
	the pci serial driver should not allow the configuration of 
devices which return an irq of 255 - it is illegal according to the 
standard and means the device has not had an irq configured.
The patch adds rejection of these invalid devices.
