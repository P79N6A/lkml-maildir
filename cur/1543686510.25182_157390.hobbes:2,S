Subject: [PATCH] Make modules work in Linus' tree on ARM
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/8/14/57

This patch allows modules to work in Linus' tree for ARM, and is the one
thing which prevents Linus' tree from building for any ARM machine.
After reviewing the /proc/kcore and kclist issues, I've decided that I'm
no longer prepared to even _think_ about supporting /proc/kcore on ARM -
it just gets too ugly, and adds too much code to make it worth the effort,
the time or the energy to implement a solution to that problem.  This is
especially true since most people use kgdb or similar rather than
/proc/kcore anyway.  /proc/kcore is a "wouldn't it be nice" feature.
The reasons that I'm going with this solution rather than fixing
/proc/kcore is that:
- to add a kclist entry for each module would mean hacking the kclist
  structure into vm_struct's ->page pointer with disgusting hacks.
  I think we can all agree that this isn't the way to go.  The
  alternative is to create Yet Another Memory Allocator, and this
  isn't something I want to see in what is now an embedded architecture.
- we'd need to find some way to dynamically reserve the virtual mapped
  memory regions for the kernel direct mapped RAM.  Since ARM uses a
  generic memory initialisation implementation which handles contiguous
  and discontiguous memory, it doesn't lend itself well to the kclist
  approach, and I'm not about to add extra callbacks from init/main.c
  (so we have kmalloc available) just to support this.
If someone _else_ wants to put the effort into fixing ARM modules to work
nicely with /proc/kcore, be my guest - I'm just no longer interested in
this problem space.
Maybe in 2.7 a generic "reserve an area of memory in this region" 
function like __get_vm_area below is in order?
Therefore, I'm providing a patch which adds the necessary changes to the
core kernel code to make the current modules solution work for ARM.
Please merge.
