Thanks for the suggestion - I'll look into it too.
Part of my reason for implementing them in this way was to make serialising
the data in an image header easy, when suspending to disk. I use the
bitmaps to record which pages were atomically copied, and generate a
similar bitmap for addresses of the freshly loaded pages prior to restoring
the image at resume time. Of course the routines that does the atomic
restore also iterates through these bitmaps. I'm not sure whether that
changes anything, but thought it was worth mentioning.
