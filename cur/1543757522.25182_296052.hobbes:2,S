I didn't say make framebuffer depend on DRM, you can still unload DRM
before suspend.  It's the other way around DRM needs framebuffer.
Suspend/resume are part of this. In the current model there is no way
for the DRM driver to see the suspend/resume events. I haven't tried
it but I suspect a suspend/resume with DRM running has a bad outcome
right now.
