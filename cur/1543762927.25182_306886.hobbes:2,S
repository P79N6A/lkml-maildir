Sorry, i was in holliday far far away from my computer (it's very rare).
I can produce a patch with coding style fixes, or wait to fix a bug in v4l2
then submit the patch. What do you prefer ? Some applications crashes when
using the v4l2 API. I can made v4l2 optional.
I know that a lot of changes needs to be applied to the driver to please
everybody. So perhaps i can try to begin with a patch (with v4l2), and wait
for feedback, and resend patch until this is correct ?
