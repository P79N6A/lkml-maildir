I thought that's where we started?
Can we somehow use the GNU linker trick which permits a warning about e.g.
gets at link time?  (Is it even documented somewhere?)  Something like:
/* bad_udelay.c */
static char bad_udelay_warning[] __attribute__((__section__(".gnu.warning")))
	= "warning: constant udelay too long";
bad_udelay() { BUG(); }
