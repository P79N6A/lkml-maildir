Hrm, the binary drivers ? oh well... some users had them freezing vs.
radeonfb before and not now. I don't know what they do and don't have
access to a machine with them (there are no ppc versions) so it will be
difficult to track. I suspect they completely reconfigure the chip and
don't restore it properly tho.
What exactly is happening. Does X launches at all ? When does it
freeze ? On X launch or when exiting it ? Have you tried disabling
dynamic clock tweaking ? (radeonfb.default_dynclk=-1 or 0 on the
cmdline, first one means "don't touch the registers", secoond one means
"disable dynamic clocks").
