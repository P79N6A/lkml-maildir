Thanks for the patch (looks reasonable to me), but:
1. No point sending a patch without a "Signed-off-by:" line.
2. Changelog (a few lines of explanation before signed-off-by) must
specify what was wrong, and why the patch is correct.
3. Always Cc: relevant maintainers or at least _somebody_ who
_will_ pick it up.
4. Gmail has done horrible things to the patch as usual, use some
other mailer or script.
And in general, please read: Documentation/SubmittingPatches
and
