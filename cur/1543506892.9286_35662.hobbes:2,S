Is this utility now incorporated in the kernel?
I haven't been able to spot it.
Where is this maintained now?
The last version I have (Don't remember from where) is v1.3.32
The primary site as mentioned in the lsm is doesn't exist anymore,
The alternative site has a realy old one dated 1998.
So Christer, if you are reading this let us know!
