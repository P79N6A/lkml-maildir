We are approaching it anyway, with more and more options being added.

Wrong.  I compile kernels for lots of different machines, all the
time.  I'm not just sat in front of one box, recompiling more or less
the same kernel all day.  They are usually each configured from
scratch, except when there are several identical boxes.

Character devices.  No, I didn't look first, by the way.  It's been
there since at least 1.2.X.

YES!!!  Because it's only vague for people who aren't used to it.

Try looking at:
* My previous contributions to this list
* The bug database I've spent six months working on, on and off.
* My website
You decide whether I am a 'troll' or not.

Please don't talk down to me.  The new users who you seem to be trying
to help, may well want to use their existing .config as a base for
their new one - moving from their distribution's 2.4 kernel to the 2.6
kernel may be the whole reason that they suddenly want to compile
their own kernel, whereas they have been happy with their
distribution's one up until now.

Although I might criticize things, I provide code to back up my
criticisms.  I didn't like the kernel Bugzilla, so I wrote an
alternative.  More people use the kernel Bugzilla than my bug
database, so quite possibly I was wrong, _but_ instead of posting
hypothetical questions to this list, I wrote an alternative.  It's
been mentioned in Kernel Traffic, a Linux magazine, and on lots of
websites.
