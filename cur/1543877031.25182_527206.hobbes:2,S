Oh, the .25 vs .26?  That's definitely noise; on other runs I see no
difference:
paravirt, patched, busy machine
ezr       Linux 2.6.21- 1000 0.25 0.52 31.3 34.4 12.7 1.02 5.44 743. 1578 4582
ezr       Linux 2.6.21- 1000 0.25 0.53 31.4 34.2 12.1 1.02 5.27 736. 1594 4806
ezr       Linux 2.6.21- 1000 0.25 0.52 31.5 34.4 14.3 1.02 5.49 736. 1587 4601
(I didn't use this result because I did it on a fairly busy machine, but
the best-case numbers are actually somewhat better than the run on a
completely quiet machine.)
