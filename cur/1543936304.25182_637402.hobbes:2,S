.. and I agree with that patch. But there will be people who try to access 
extended space by mistake, and they'll have a hard-locked machine or 
something.

No. It needs to be automatic, OR THE OTHER WAY AROUND.
Ie we disable the unsafe feature on purpose, and then force people who 
access it to do so *consciously*.
Extended config space is different, for chissake! It's not even like it's 
just a bigger normal config space where normal config accesses just 
overflow into it. It really does have different rules etc.
