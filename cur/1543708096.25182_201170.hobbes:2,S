> Anyway that's irrelevant: the splitting change only affects shell _scripts_
Well, I wouldn't say 'irrelevant'.  Some might claim that this question
(what the major shell's do) is already known, but surely it does matter.
The shells _do_ need to find the path to the script file in the argv[]
passed to them, and the proposed change does alter the parsing of that
argv[].
The splitting does not affect only the scripts.  It also affects the
argv[] array presented to the shells, which may or may not deal with
such as we would like.
