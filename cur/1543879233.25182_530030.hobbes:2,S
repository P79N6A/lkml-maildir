Well with old credit cards (magnetic) it was possible (as a matter of fact it was trivial)
With new chip cards its a lot harder but still possible, only the risk is smaller in means that
the fraud will be very limited.

I didn't have time to read the pdf but i will. As for erasing ram it usually means to also 
scramble it and there are chips that advertise that can do this in 1 cycle. Well reaching the bus or ram 
to probe it is another thing. Most die in such chip are also hidden under protective meshes so it 
takes some time. What you said is true, systems are created and broken, the question is what 
you have to hide and whether the person that wants to break it has the money the will the knowledge and the equipment 
to do it. Because if he is to spend a million euro only to create fraud of half a million euro then he wont do it.
That has to do with risk management.

I understand and i agree, thing is that i dont decide about which parts are given GPL.
While the RSA module is given standalone, it can be still used by others to develop
their own signing and authenticating mechanisms. For example some will decide to do 
hashing of code with md5 while others with sha1 and some will do padding compliant
with pkcs1 other will implement other schemas e.t.c. I want to say although this is not
really ready to be used for binary signing, it has the advantage to provide basic functionality
and freedom to other developers to implement their own schemas.

people think that by hiding implementations (which can be reverse engineered of course)
will make it more difficult to break. Well i agree with you but... its not in my hands.
So i will come back with these parts replaced with some of my own
And a question
Can someone provide me with a full list of kernel functions where code is loaded?
