And if (more like 'when', actually) next AMD CPU will have 2x128bit bus
instead of 2x64bit? Revert back to XMM?

I doubt it unless real-world data will back your claim up.
I did microbenchmarking. You said it looks good in microbench but
hurts real-world.
Sometime after that I made a patch which allows for switching
clear/copy routines on the fly, and played a bit with real-world tests.
See 
http://www.thisishull.net/showthread.php?t=36562
In short, I ran forking test programs which excercise clearing and copying
routines in kernel. I wasn't able to find a usage pattern where page copying
using SSE non-temporal stores is a loss. Page clear was demonstrably worse,
no argument about that.
If you know such usage pattern, I'd like to test it.
