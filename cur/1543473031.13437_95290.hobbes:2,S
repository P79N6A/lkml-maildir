Hi guys,
I want to get my computer to power off when I tell it to.  I've enabled
APM support, and now /sbin/poweroff does what I want.
But also, after the BIOS timeout elapses and I haven't touched the
keyboard or mouse, the computer goes to sleep even though there are
runnable processes. :-(
Is this expected behaviour?  Is there a way to just have soft-power-off
support without sleep-on-idle?
Tim.
