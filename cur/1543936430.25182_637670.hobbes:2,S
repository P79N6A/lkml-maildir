Unless we get them to lay off using OSI(Linux) altogether, that won't work
well.  You'd stop the slow POST on S3 resume, but you'd also change the
behaviour of the firmware somewhere else too (not to mention it is useless
to change the OSI string in most AML code I've seen after you ran the _INI
stuff).
It would have been way easier if ACPI had a more complete and thought-out
video control API.  There should be a way to request a BIOS re-post of the
video hardware through an optional ACPI call.
