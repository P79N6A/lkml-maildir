Because the point is *not* about existing bugs in kernel code. At some
point Chris Snook (who started this thread) did write that "If I knew
of the existing bugs in the kernel, I would be sending patches for them,
not this series" or something to that effect.
The point is about *author expecations*. If people do expect atomic_read()
(or a variant thereof) to have volatile semantics, why not give them such
a variant?
And by the way, the point is *also* about the fact that cpu_relax(), as
of today, implies a full memory clobber, which is not what a lot of such
loops want. (due to stuff mentioned elsewhere, summarized in that summary)

(so it's about compiler barrier expectations only, though I fully agree
that those who're using atomic_t as if it were some magic thing that lets
them write lockless code are sorrily mistaken.)

Possibly, but the point is not about existing bugs, as mentioned above.
Some such bugs have been found nonetheless -- reminds me, can somebody
