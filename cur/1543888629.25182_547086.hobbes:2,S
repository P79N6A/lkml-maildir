Subject: [patch 1/5] cio: Update documentation.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

From: Cornelia Huck <cornelia.huck@de.ibm.com>
- read_dev_chars()/read_conf_data() are deprecated. Don't document them, but
  advise to issue the channel program from the driver itself.
- Remove some really obsolete and incorrect stuff.

-read_dev_chars() - Read Device Characteristics
-
-This routine returns the characteristics for the device specified.
-
-The function is meant to be called with the device already enabled; that is,
-at earliest during set_online() processing.
-
-The ccw_device must not be locked prior to calling read_dev_chars().
-
-The function may be called enabled or disabled.
-
-int read_dev_chars(struct ccw_device *cdev, void **buffer, int length );
-
-cdev   - the ccw_device the information is requested for.
-buffer - pointer to a buffer pointer. The buffer pointer itself
-         must contain a valid buffer area.
-length - length of the buffer provided.
-
-The read_dev_chars() function returns :
-
-      0 - successful completion
--ENODEV - cdev invalid
--EINVAL - an invalid parameter was detected, or the function was called early.
--EBUSY  - an irrecoverable I/O error occurred or the device is not
-          operational.

-
-Retrieve the device dependent configuration data. Please have a look at your 
-device dependent I/O commands for the device specific layout of the node

-buffer - Pointer to a buffer pointer. The read_conf_data() routine

-length - Length of the buffer allocated and retrieved.
-lpm    - Logical path mask to be used for retrieving the data. If
-         zero the data is retrieved on the next path available.

-The read_conf_data() function returns :
