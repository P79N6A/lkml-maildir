Hi David.  Thanks for writing.  This question has come up a number of times
lately, so I'll respond to the LK list too.
The open-source aacraid driver (formerly named percraid) is included in the
Red Hat Linux 7 kernel 2.2.16-22.  I'd recommend using that kernel (if not
the whole distro), or at least you can grab the aacraid patches from the
kernel source RPM for that kernel from ftp.redhat.com or one of its mirrors.
Be sure to grab all the *aacraid* patches from the /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES
directory after installing the kernel source RPM, and apply those patches to
your own kernel.  It's is known to work with 2.2.18 kernels.  Work on
porting to the 2.4 kernel is not yet complete.
Thanks for buying Dell!
