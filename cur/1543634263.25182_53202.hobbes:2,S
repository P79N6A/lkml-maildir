Actually, select() scales a lot better than poll() for _dense_ bitmaps.
The problem with non-scalability ends up being either sparse bitmaps
(minor problem, poll() can help) or just the work involved in watching a
large number of fd's (major problem, but totally unrelated to the bitmap
itself, and poll() usually makes it worse thanks to more data to be
moved).
Anyway, I was talking about the scalability of the _data_structure_, not 
the scalability performance-wise. Performance scalability is a non-issue 
for something like setaffinity(), since it's just not called at any rate 
approaching poll.

If we end up using a default of 1024, maybe you'll have to recompile that
part of the system that has anything to do with CPU affinity in about
10-20 years by just upping the number a bit. Quite frankly, that's going
to be the _least_ of the issues.
