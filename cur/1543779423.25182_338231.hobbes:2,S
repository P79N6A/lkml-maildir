MPlayer cares more about unbroken sound drivers, since the video needs
to run at the speed of your sound boards oscillator if you don't want sound
and video to run at different rates.
Unfortunately people use an almost random mix of alsa, alsa-lib and .asoundrc
setups, including me, mplayer through dmix is one jitter-fest, mplayer straight
to the alsa pcm device works better, but of course using the oss emulation
seems to work best of all :-)
I never noticed any difference during 2.4 between using rtc and not using rtc.
