Hmm, the only shot in the dark thing I can think of is the Cyrix chip; I run
tha 686MX here and it is perfect, but if you have marginal heatsink or fan
or other cooling issues, you may well see problems. Stick
/usr/sbin/set6x86 -s 0xc2 0x8
in your start-up scripts. It switches on power-save on HLT for the CPU.
If the problems go away or are reduced, odds on you have a cooling issue. Also,
check your RAM (swap it with that in a 'known good' box).
