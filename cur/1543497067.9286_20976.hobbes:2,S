Problem: Pressing Control-c while playing certain sound files under
         Linux 2.2.x does not have an effect until I press Control-z
         shortly after.
Example: "cat something.wav > /dev/dsp" cannot be stopped by Control-c 
         but if I press Control-z shortly after, it does stop (and not 
         suspend).  This also happens with playmidi and .mid files,
         but *not* when cat'ing .au files.  
I've seen this problem on several 2.2 kernels including 2.2.9, on at
least 2 different machines with at least 3 different sound cards.
This problem does not occur with 2.0.36 -- Control-c stops the sound
immediately.
Any idea on what may be going on here?  Is it just me?
Thanks,
Navin.
