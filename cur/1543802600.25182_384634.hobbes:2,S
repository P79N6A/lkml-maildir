I didn't check the effects of reverting to the default inline-limit, did
you find any negative impacts? I'm thinking about the critical code
paths e.g. minor faults. There better should not be an additional
function call that would have been inlined with the bigger inline limit,
since function calls are quite expensive on s390.
