Agreed, IIRC, didn't ANSI C spec address this specific point? That any two
types which contain matching simple types must be considered to match,
regardless of how they were declared, typedef or explicitly. e.g. Unlike
Pascal, typedef does not create "new" types. It creates aggregates of simple
types.
