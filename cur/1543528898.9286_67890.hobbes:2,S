Hello,
I've merged my eepro100 driver update with recent 2.3 kernels.
The driver is put at
ftp://ftp.sw.com.sg/pub/Linux/people/saw/kernel/v2.3/
and will appear soon at its US mirror
ftp://ftp.swusa.com/pub/Linux/people/saw/kernel/v2.3/
The changes address the two main problems of TX timeouts and broken multicast
filter settings.  The driver also supports 82559ER chip.
More detailed changelog accompanies the driver.
The counterpart changes for 2.2 kernels are fully incorporated into Alan's
2.2.15pre13.
Feed back is welcome as usual.
If nothing criminal is found in the code I'll submit it to be included into
official 2.3 kernel.
Best regards
					Andrey V.
