UML = User Mode Linux.  I.E. configuring and building the normal linux kernel 
with "ARCH=um", which makes for much less rebooting when testing this sort of 
thing out.  I can try making an equivalent bootable kernel and re-running the 
test under there to confirm I get the failure, if you'd like, but this part 
of the kernel (the virtual memory subsystem) really shouldn't be affected by 
this.

The fact that the User Mode Linux people wrote their own trap handler?  Do you 
think that changes the trap being dumped, or is likely to alter the behavior 
of the VM subsystem?
