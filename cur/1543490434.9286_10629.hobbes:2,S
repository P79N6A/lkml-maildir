Hi Mike, Keith.  Modules are part of the kernel and aren't supposed to use
libc.  However, the modutils programs--including insmod--are linked to it. 
I'd suggest compiling those programs yourself, rather than getting them as
binaries.  Bjorn Ekwall's new release is at
http://www.pi.se/blox/modutils/.
  He wrote a couple of messages about it
to the linux-kernel list recently, and in particular solicited testers who
have glibc 2.1. Good luck!
