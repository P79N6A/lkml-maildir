The first technique is not sufficient with modern disk controllers, which
may reorder sector writes within a block.  A checksum, especially a robust
CRC32, is sufficient, but rather expensive.
Mohan has a clever technique that is computationally trivial and only uses
one bit per sector:

Unfortunately, it's also patented:

Perhaps IBM will clarify their position with respect to free software and
patents in the upcoming conference.
