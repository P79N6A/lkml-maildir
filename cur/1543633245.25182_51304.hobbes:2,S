   would you be willing to accept a patch that enables per-socket
   accounting with a CONFIG_ option?
What is the point?
If all the dists will enable it then everybody eats the overhead.
If the dists don't enable it, how useful is it and what's so wrong
with it being an external patch people just apply when they need to
diagnose something like this?
