Looks like you've hit the pot-luck of VIA problems, and elevator bugs
(2.4.1).  When the last crash hit, did you recycle with the power button or
the reset button?
Step one, if you can, get a backup of the raw device.  This will make
everything easier if there are problems in step 3.  
Step two, grab the latest reiserfsprogs from
ftp.reiserfs.org/pub/reiserfsprogs.
Step three, reiserfsck --rebuild-sb ; reiserfsck --rebuild-tree
Drop me a line if there are any questions.
