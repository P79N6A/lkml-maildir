Hi,

long sched_setaffinity(pid_t pid, cpumask_t new_mask)
{
...
	cpus_allowed = cpuset_cpus_allowed(p);
	cpus_and(new_mask, new_mask, cpus_allowed);
	retval = set_cpus_allowed(p, new_mask);
If cpuset_cpus_allowed doesnt return the current online mask and we want
to schedule on a cpu that has been added since boot it looks like we
will fail.

Its up to the cpusets code to register a hotplug notifier to update the
top_cpuset maps.

If the top level cpuset pointed to cpu_online_map instead of a boot time
copy we wouldnt need any hotplug gunk in the cpusets code.
Maybe the notifier is the right way to go, but it seems strange to
create two copies of cpu_online_map (with the associated possibiliy of
the two getting out of sync).
