Plex86 can 100% isolate guests from each other.  What I'm saying
is, it takes 99% of the work to do a full x86 VM which doesn't
need those 2 macros for PUSHF/POPF.  (my oversimplified, but
yet useful explanation of the state of affairs)
You have to do a lot of work to "get under the hood" of an
OS, to fix up a few cases where if you let them run native,
they'll get the wrong information or make the wrong thing
happen.  Not to the other guests, but to themselves.  So if
you don't need to do those things, you can let them run
without all the black magic.  Let's take such conversation
out-of-band.  It doesn't belong on the LK list.
