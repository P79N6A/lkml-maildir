I think this one is a stand-alone patch that could be applied without
the others, and could probably be submitted as a prereq to the EA and
ACL patches instead of the other way around...
You also are missing the settings for default journaling mode - a few
people have expressed interest in this, especially for the root fs,
where it is somewhat non-obvious to specify the journaling mode.
