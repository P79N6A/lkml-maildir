Heres my 2p's worth;
For parallel port autoprobe information I have to use io=0x378 irq=7 dma=3 as
options for parport_pc
cat /proc/sys/dev/parport/parport0/hardware
base:   0x378 (0x778)
irq:    7
dma:    3
modes:  PCSPP,TRISTATE,EPP,ECP,DMA
cat /proc/sys/dev/parport/parport0/autoprobe
CLASS:PRINTER;
MODEL:Stylus COLOR 600;
MANUFACTURER:EPSON;
COMMAND SET:ESCPL2,BDC;
Without the dma=3 option, the autoprobe information is empty, even though the
parallel port is deteted with modes: PCSPP,TRISTATE,EPP,ECP.
I think this has been the case for me since 2.2.12.
Kev.
