I don't know what caused the kernel to give up baging me but it did. I 
enabled CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB and CONFIG_KERNEL_DEBUG and now everything 
works okay. I have inserted the patch you gave me and the wbsd-patch is 
inserted too, everything works now, don't know why, i can cat 
/proc/devices too. Loading modules is not a problem too.
