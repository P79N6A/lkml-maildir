Hi Linus,
  sorry for bothering you again so quickly with ncpfs. Could you apply
this patch to 2.3.25? It limits mmap() to 4GB, because of ncpfs does
not support bigger files. Otherwise I have to check whether 
vm_pgoff << PAGE_SHIFT overflows in nopage... This seems clearer to me.
  BTW, it looks to me like that now vm_start and vm_end are both
page aligned. Is it true? There is check in ncpfs_nopage which is able to
handle (vm_end & ~PAGE_MASK) != 0. Can I remove it without any bad effects?
(is there planned move from bytes to page units in vm_start/vm_end or 
not?)
  I do not know, whether -EFBIG is correct (it is not listed on mmap()
man page), but it looks right to me (other alternative is -EINVAL).
						Thanks,

P.S.: Please, apply it even if you are not going to remove 4GB limit on
filesize from ia32 anytime soon. You can get above 4GB limit on 64bit archs 
without this patch and it is not correct.
