ok. I send to all on CC our IPC and utsname namespace patch.
We implemented them as separate namespaces (to please Eric), compile
time configurable (to please embedded people) and using "current"
namespace context (as we do in OpenVZ).
I suppose all these points can be disucssed. In many respects the
patches look like a bit changed Eric/DHansen/OpenVZ.
I suppose this should be discussed/worked out and commited to
Linus/Andrew as there are any serious issues here.

Eric, the namespaces itself can be without any IDs, really.
But on top of that projects like OpenVZ/vserver can implement VPSs,
umbreallas etc. and will introduce IDs and interfaces they are
accustomed of.

I think it is not that easy as you wish to think of it.
Consider 2 processes: A and B.
each of them has its own fs namespace, but common network namespace.
process A passes file descriptor fd to process B via unix socket.
So the same file belongs to 2 different fs namespaces.
Will you simply forbid fd passing to another fd namespace?
I see 2 possibilities here.
1. You either introduce fully isolated resource namespaces, than it is
flat, not nested.
2. Or you need to state correctly what "nesting" means from your point
of view and which operations parent namespace can do with its children.
Last time I had a talk with Herbert we ended up that such a nesting is
nothing more than a privileges delegation, e.g. allows you to manage
your children.
Eric, can your describe what you want from nesting on some particular
namespace, for example fs, ipc, networking, ...? Not by word "nesting",
but by concrete operations which parent can do and why a child looks
"nested".
Just to make it more clear: my understanding of word "nested" means that
if you have, for example, a nested IPC namespace, than parent can see
all the resources (sems, shms, ...) of it's children and have some
private, while children see only its own set of private resources. But
it doesn't look like you are going to implement anything like this.
So what is nesting then? Ability to create namespace? To delegate it
some part of own resource limits?

I propose to use "namespace" naming.
1. This is already used in fs.
2. This is what IMHO suites at least OpenVZ/Eric
3. it has good acronym "ns".

agreed.
