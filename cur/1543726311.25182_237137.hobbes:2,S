But this is not all you'll have to look at.
Single application performs does not really tell the whole story.  If
you touch more memory, more cache is used.  In SMP machines the cost of
cacheline transfers are added.  And in multi-core processors the cores
even share some cache which means every bit used might decrease system
performance ever so slightly.
If the added complexity is manageable the avoided memory operations
should be a win even if you cannot directly measure it.
