   Moral of the story: in my opinion kernel developers should reduce to a
   minimum the use of #define, and preferably use words in uppercase and/or
   with underscores, in any case not commonly used words.
Or maybe you should change your datastructure to not have member names
the conflict with 7 year old well defined global symbols in the Linux
kernel?
