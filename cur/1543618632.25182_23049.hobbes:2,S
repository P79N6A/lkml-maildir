A tiny patch was posted about 4-6 months ago
The patch is total overkill. Just remove the error reporting if the right
firmware was already loaded. You've written a fixup wrapper around a 
rather nonsensical erorr check for an existing non-error.
The same will occur with CPU hot plugging in the future as well as ACPI
power saving sometimes and in those cases the patch you posted doesn't
help anyway.
