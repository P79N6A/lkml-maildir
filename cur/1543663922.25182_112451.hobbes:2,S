But apparently what knows is not very modern. I'm no slouch either being a
former BSDi (the original Unix folks) engineer, but I don't go dimissing
folks implicitly like he did to "The Will", William Irwin... and then not
adding anything usable in the conversation. That's just no excuse for an
adult running a company or in a public forum that's discussing these very
important issues.
Frankly, I don't care what he has or what traditional so called "Unix
folks" think. Even FreeBSD's SMPng project, using BSD/OS's 5.0 code
deals with these issues respectfully. These old school Unix folks seem
to have a much more modern attitude towards this stuff than either
you or Victor.
