Subject: Paging algorithm used? (Curiosity)

I'm taking an OS class, and we discussed paging algorithms (WS and WSClock
in particular). I remember a discussion on this list a week or so ago
which said that LRU was the standard method used in the kernel. Can anyone
give me a quick rundown on the actual algorithm used (the only one I know
is Clock). I'm mostly just curious, though there is a final project
requirement for the class :)
Thanks,
Drew
