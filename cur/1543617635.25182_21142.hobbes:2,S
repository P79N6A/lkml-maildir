I think it's in the ACPI table since a certain M$ OS finds the interrupt
source. As I mentioned to Alan, I tried the latest ACPI patch but as you
say, nothing is done with the information. I haven't tried enabling
ACPI_DEBUG but that sounds to be a next step.
I'd be interested in trying out your patch as well.
Cheers,
Jes
