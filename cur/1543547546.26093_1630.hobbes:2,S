Odd.  I started seeing mailbox corruption the day before the first post
showed up here.  Since it was only one list (BUGTRAQ) and I'm still at
pre7, I've ascribed it to a problem with the sender.  The corruption
shows up as weird characters at the end of the file.  I only mention it
because of the odd time-coincident nature of the error.  I don't suppose
there is a connection?
