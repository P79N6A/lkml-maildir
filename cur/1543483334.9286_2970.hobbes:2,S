hi,
since switching to the 2.2.0 kernel i have started to pick up 
the following error in /var/log/messages :
kernel: lockd: failed to monitor 138.251.201.54
i mount an nfsw filesystem off of the machine 138.251.201.54.
does anyone know what is causing this error. (i never had it
with any of the previous kernels)
keith.
