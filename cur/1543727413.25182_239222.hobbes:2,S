Hi, 
Back when we were discussing the need for a memory barrier in sync_page(), 
it came to me (thanks Andrea!) that the bit operations can be perfectly 
reordered on architectures other than x86. 
I think the commentary on i386 bitops.h is misleading, its worth 
to note that that these operations are not guaranteed not to be 
reordered on different architectures. 
clear_bit() already does that:
 * clear_bit() is atomic and may not be reordered.  However, it does
 * not contain a memory barrier, so if it is used for locking purposes,
 * you should call smp_mb__before_clear_bit() and/or smp_mb__after_clear_bit()
 * in order to ensure changes are visible on other processors.
