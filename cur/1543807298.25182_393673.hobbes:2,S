To me it would be easier if I could use a repository that get's updated every
day (or several times a day) than wait a week for the patch to be available.
Moreover, a repository in fact _is_ easyier when it comes to debugging than is a
tarball or such. What if one says 'Gimme that driver 6 weeks ago'? See ... with
a repository I could just get it whereas with patches I have to read lots of
mails to get a clue when stuff got applied (in the tree and over here on my hard
disk).
I didn't mean to start a discussion here. I was just telling you what is easier
for me. Anyone has it's own style of coding. Someone likes patches, others
just live with them. My boss doesn't like vi either. So I may not use it? Puh!
