Hi,
  I appear to be having a locking-for-good problem on kernel 2.1.131.  The
symptom is that after running CKermit (192), it tries to open /dev/ttyS1
(and is not able to set the speed to 115200), then if I exit, and restart
kermit, I get a Device or resource busy error.  (strace'ing reveals the
open failing, with EBUSY).  I'm wondering why that is occurring because
there is nothing else touching /dev/ttyS1, and I thought that even if
kermit didn't close the descriptor, the OS would auto-close it and
decrement the reference count.  Am I missing something?
 Thanks,
 --S
