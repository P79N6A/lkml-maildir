Just might be relevant here, I found a bug with the recent
x86_64 changes to 2.6.14-rc* which causes the node_to_cpumask[] to go bad for
the boot processor.  This happens on both amd and em64t boxes. I guess the
kevent/0 cpus_allowed mask might be changed by the bad node_to_cpumask[]
here?
On a opteron box (courtesy Ananth M)
# cat /sys/devices/system/node/node0/cpumap
00000000
# cat /sys/devices/system/node/node1/cpumap
00000003
On our em64t IBM x460 NUMA,
# cat /sys/devices/system/node/node0/cpumap
0000000e
# cat /sys/devices/system/node/node1/cpumap
000000f1
Here is a fix for that, I have sounded out Andi Kleen on this and waiting
for his comments.  Maybe somebody can test the patch below on amds?
Thanks,
Kiran

Patch to fix the BP node_to_cpumask.  2.6.14-rc* broke the boot cpu bit as
the cpu_to_node(0) is now not setup early enough for numa_init_array.
cpu_to_node[] is setup much later at srat_detect_node on acpi srat based
em64t machines.  This seems like a problem on amd machines too,  Tested on
em64t though. /sys/devices/system/node/node0/cpumap shows up sanely after
this patch.
