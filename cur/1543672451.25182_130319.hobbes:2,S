That's all nice, but why have those options been removed if input 
devices are created as modules? This somewhat breaks compatibility with 
a lot of 2.4.x scripts. I run both kernels so I can compare things and 
send bug reports with both trees. Also, 2.5.x has been rather cruel to 
me in the past, so I tend to run the stable branch more often than not. 
Can the VT and VGA options be placed back into the config if input 
devices are created as modules? It would remove some confusion imo.
Thanks,
David
