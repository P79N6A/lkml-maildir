Ah, but there is plenty patentable in the current phase tree design,
implemented in Tux2 since early last year.  Have you ever seen a
three-root atomic commit before?  So if you're right then there is still
time.  On the other hand, I've heard that as soon as I disclose it
publicly it's not patentable.
Read 'white hat patent' in all of the above, IOW, GPL-compatible
licence.
