seems similar to my problem. If I connect large (75-120G) disks on
both PDC channels and run /sbin/badblocks in parallel (dd might do, too)
I get a kernel panic/freeze. I get it even with no disk on the onboard
controller. I can reproduce this on two different VIA boards with both,
a PDC20267 and a PDC20262, too. On a board with Ali chiset, however
no error occured during a short (5 minutes) test. On a board with an
Intel
chipset I got some "DMA timeout" after 3 hours, but may be this was
an unrelated problem.
Dieter.
