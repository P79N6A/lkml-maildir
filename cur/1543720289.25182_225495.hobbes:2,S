If  init can  launch /bin/bash  (actually,  it lauches  getty in  most
setups), why can't it start the userland keyboard driver daemon?
Back  in the  old days  before the  introduction of  /etc/rc.d/, every
daemon was started from by init.

As soon as the daemon is  running, /bin/bash can talk to the keyboard.
There is not much concurrency problems here.  The current input system
makes  it possible  for /bin/bash  to start  opening the  keyboard and
waiting for input before the userspace handler is ready.
    Valdis> At that point you're stuck...
I  can't see  how stuck  it is.   And if  you fear  that  the userland
keyboard driver  would crash  (maybe due to  bugs), use  the 'respawn'
option in /etc/inittab.
