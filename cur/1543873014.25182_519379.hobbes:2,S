I would prefer to have try_to_freeze() followed by the
kthread_stop_info.k check. Something like
if (try_to_freeze())
	/*some barrier ensuring all writes are completed */
if (kthread_stop_info.k == current)
		return 1;
return 0;
This would be helpful in situations (atleast for cpu-hotplug)
where we want to stop a frozen thread immediately after thawing it.
Something like
CPU_DEAD:
thaw_process(p);
kthread_stop(p);
p = NULL;
Is there a problem with this line of thinking ?
thanks and regards
gautham.
