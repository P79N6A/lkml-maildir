Hallo!
I also have 800MHz iBook (2.2, 2 USB) and had the same problem with the 
21.6.22 kernel a while ago and reverted back to 2.6.21. I'm not a kernel 
guy but I think I remember from kernel traces that it looked like (wise 
chosen words ;-)) that the problems had something to do with 
deactivating the firewire "subsystem".
I don't have traces at hand and due to lack of time cannot reproduce it 
up to tomorrow. However this hint may speed up your analysis!
[rather long To-list, is everybody happy with this?]
