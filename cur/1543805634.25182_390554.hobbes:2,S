Ok. That makes sense. I thought the mempool_xxx functions were only for 
emergencies. But nevertheless you still duplicate all memory allocation 
functions. I already was a bit concerned when I added the _node stuff.
What may be better is to add some kind of "allocation policy" to an 
allocation. That allocation policy could require the allocation on a node, 
distribution over a series of nodes, require allocation on a particular 
node, or allow the use of emergency pools etc.
Maybe unify all the different page allocations to one call and do the 
same with the slab allocator.
