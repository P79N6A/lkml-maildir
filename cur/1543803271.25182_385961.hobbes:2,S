Subject: [PATCH 00/17] fuse: fixes, cleanups and asynchronous read requests

This series contains recent fixes and cleanups to FUSE.  The bigger
part is the support for asynchronous reads.  This will be a big
performance improvement of filesystems in certain situations due to
the readahead logic being able to work to it's full capability.  
I'd prefer to have this in 2.6.16.  The merge window is still open,
isn't it?
Thanks,
Miklos
