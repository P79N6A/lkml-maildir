You have  been automatically removed from  the HBGUSA-JAMESPATTERSON list
(HBGUSA-JamesPatterson) as  a result  of repeated delivery  error reports
from your  mail system. This  decision was  based on the  automatic error
monitoring policy  in effect for the  list, and has not  been reviewed or
otherwise confirmed  by a human  being. If  you receive this  message, it
means that  something is wrong: while  you are obviously able  to receive
mail, your mail system has been regularly reporting that your account did
not exist, or that you were otherwise permanently unable to receive mail.
Here is some information which may assist  you or your local help desk in
determining the cause of the problem:
- The failing address is linux-kernel@VGER.KERNEL.ORG.
- The first error was reported on 25 Aug 2006.
- Since then, a total of 2 delivery errors have been received.
- The last reported error was: SMTP; 550 5.7.1 Content-Policy reject msg:
The  message contains  HTML subpart,  therefore  we consider  it SPAM  or
Outlook Virus. TEXT/PLAIN is accepted.!; S1751171AbWH3TAN
PLEASE DO NOT  IGNORE THIS MESSAGE. While you can  of course re-subscribe
to the list, it is important for  you to report this problem to your mail
administrator so that  it can be solved. This problem  is not specific to
the HBGUSA-JAMESPATTERSON list, and also  affects your private mail. This
means  that YOU  HAVE PROBABLY  LOST SOME  PRIVATE MAIL  AS WELL.  Anyone
trying to  write to  you during  the same time  frame will  probably have
received the same  errors for the same  reason. The HBGUSA-JAMESPATTERSON
list is  but one of the  many people who may  have tried to write  to you
while your mail system was malfunctioning.
DO NOT LET TECHNICAL PEOPLE CONVINCE YOU THAT THIS IS NORMAL. It is never
normal for a mail system to claim  that a valid, working account does not
exist, just as it would not be  normal for the post office to return some
of  your mail  with  "addressee  unknown" when  the  address was  written
correctly.  It is  true that  some mail  systems are  less reliable  than
others, and your technical people may be doing the best they can with the
tools  they have.  But, ultimately,  the level  of service  that you  are
receiving is the result of a  business decision, and not something due to
a universal technical limitation that  one can only accept. Reliable mail
systems do exist, and  it is ultimately up to you  to decide whether this
level of service is acceptable or not.
