Does everyone agree that killing a process is always the best approach
to resolve an OOM? If the OOM is caused by e.g. a growing tmpfs or 
memory leaks in the kernel it won't help much to kill processes that
may respawn. 
Would it be useful if it was possible to register another oom-handler?
Some architectures could then choose to e.g. reboot the system instead.

Subject: oom killer and its superior braindamage in 2.4
Hi all,
I just thought (ok it was yesterday) about stress testing my mysql db.
I used this:
- mystress.pl localhost mysql root test 600 300 60 "select * from user"
It worked like a charme. So I tried:
- mystress.pl localhost mysql root test 1800 900 60 "select * from user"
My machine has 512MB RAM and 512MB SWAP.
I expected that the 2nd run will OOM my machine but I did not expect this 
silly behaviour.
The following log entry appeared only _once_ (there were ~700 mysqld running)
- Feb 21 10:03:22 codeman kernel: Out of Memory: Killed process 1463 (mysqld).
Instead of really killing either mysqld or mystress.pl the OOM killer decided 
to kill apache (apache did nothing but had 5 threads sleeping)
- Feb 21 10:04:57 codeman kernel: Out of Memory: Killed process 2657 (apache).
The above log entry (apache) appeared for about 4 hours every some seconds 
(same PID) until I thought about sysrq-b to get out of this braindead 
behaviour. The machine was somewhat dead for me because I was not able to do 
anything but sysrq. The system itself was _not_ dead, there was massive disk 
i/o. This is 2.4.20 vanilla.
Is there any chance we can fix this up?
ciao, Marc
