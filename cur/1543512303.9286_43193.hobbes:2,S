Well, if you refuse to think it's your business. I can't help here.

One more time. Slowly.  Take. Care. To. Look. At. The. Code. That. Is.
Supposed. To. Work. With. Devfs.  Look. At. The. VFS. Code.
Sheesh...

I hate to piss on your parade, but _that_ will definitely take some
reading of the source. It's kinda hard to fork the code without learning
it... Oh, wait. I see. _That_ part of the work you are leaving to Richard
humbly limiting your participation with the PR stuff. Sorry, but you are
doing it poorly.

Though luck, then. What you are telling boils down to: "I want it; I don't
give a damn for the problems; code around and I can't be even bothered to
figure out what those problems _are_." Do you really expect to be taken
seriously?

No, sir. You will have to deal with the technical reasons. "Purely" has
nothing to this sad fact. BTW, may I also remind you that l-k is a
_technical_ list?
Look, I have no vendetta against devfs. I respect Richard. I _have_
technical problems with devfs as it is implemented. And I have no respect
to the screaming advocates. FWIC they may go and play with themselves, NT
or something equally icky. If I'll get a taste for political bullshit,
well, I know where to find SplashSnort. Could we _PLEASE_ stop this
idiocy? If you want to figure out WTF causes problems with devfs - you are
welcome. And that will take some RTFS. Or you can scream and act as a brat
expecting people to do the things they do not want just because _you_ want
it. In that case... well, see above.
