Hi Linus,
I'm planning to remove the i8xx_tco watchdog driver
since we now have the iTCO_wdt driver that has a broader scope.
Therefor I created a small patch (that adds the driver to the
feature-removal-schedule list and defaults CONFIG_I8XX_TCO to n).
There is no impact at any of the drivers.
So can you please pull from 'master' branch of
        git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/wim/linux-2.6-watchdog.git
or if master.kernel.org hasn't synced up yet:
        master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/wim/linux-2.6-watchdog.git
This will update the following files:
 Documentation/feature-removal-schedule.txt |    8 ++++++++
 drivers/char/watchdog/Kconfig              |    1 +
