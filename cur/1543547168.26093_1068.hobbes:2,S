Ooops....the time frame is closer to today on part of this.  While it may
be a while before we hit the 1T limit on 1 single device, things like
readpage, do so based of the inode -- which on a metadisk could have a
filesize much larger than current physical device limits.  So it seems
that at least at the vnode level this is something that may have to 
go into the 2.4 series fairly soon, or am I missing something?  Why
are blocks int's vs. unsigned's ?  Was it to pass back errno's in some
cases?
