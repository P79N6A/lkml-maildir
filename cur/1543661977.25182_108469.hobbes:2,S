Hi Kim,
the probls you describe ("all sorts of SCSI timeout errors, SCSI comm
errors, etc") are experienced by me and other users of KT266-based mobos
as well, under the same circumstances (cdparanoia, SCSI-emul); see
thread "kernel 2.4.x + via-based kt266 mobo = IDE cdroms probls
(revisited)" here on LKML . Maybe the probl isn't restricted to SIS735
or KT266 after all...
Best,
Andre
