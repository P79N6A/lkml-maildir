Does anyone knows where the guide to writing framebuffer drivers be? My
current link to that site is 
http://www.csoft.net/~systems/jim/fb.html
 but
it does not exist anymore. Would the author come forward so I can update
my Framebuffer HOWTO document - thanks.
(Yes, I know, I need to get that spliff-smoking Penguin patch out soon).
Cheers, 
Alex
