doesn't go away, even worse, I tested latest Linus's git tree, and same hang both is suspend to disk and suspend to ram (before suspending)

^ This thing is fixed (sorry for bothering you)

^ This one I don't think is related to NO_HZ, maybe it is hardware problem, but it exist without NO_HZ

This one is now discussed, I will look at it and it is not related to NO_HZ
And hangs with S3 as I said occur even in 2.6.20
And I forgot to tell about another problem with (now I know ,hi-resolution timers)
That before suspend to ram APIC timer is used and HPET is not used :
root@MAIN:/home/maxim# cat /sys/devices/system/clockevents/clockevents0/registered
lapic                F:0007 M:3(periodic) C: 1
hpet                 F:0003 M:1(shutdown) C: 0
lapic                F:0007 M:3(periodic) C: 0
root@MAIN:/home/maxim#   
But after suspend to ram HPET is 'woken'
root@MAIN:/home/maxim# cat /sys/devices/system/clockevents/clockevents0/registered
lapic                F:0007 M:3(one shoot) C: 1
hpet                 F:0003 M:3(one shoot) C: 0
lapic                F:0007 M:3(one shoot) C: 0
Note that I added those (one shoot), (periodic) descriptions, would be nice to have them in kernel, can I send a patch ?  ;-)
and I see average of 18 IRQs/sec on IRQ 0
