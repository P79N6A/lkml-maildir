Hi!
Since a couple of new kernel versions already, I use to modify two files 
related to the netfilter part to be able to add more
ports for the IRC NAT module. I was wondering if you could definitively 
apply those modifications to the kernel sources.
Here are my two modifications:
In /usr/src/linux-2.4.20/net/ipv4/netfilter:
I change "#define MAX_PORTS 8" to "#define MAX_PORTS 15" in both 
"ip_conntrack_irc.c" and "ip_nat_irc.c".
I make those modifications to be able to add more ports than only 8 when 
loading the modules as there are actually
a lot more IRC ports than 8 (ex: 6660-6669, 7000, that's already 11).
I'd greatly appreciate a reply even though my suggestion is not a good one.
Thanks.
