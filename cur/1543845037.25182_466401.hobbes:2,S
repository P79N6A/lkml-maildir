I think having all the user-writable partitions
noexec actually does prevent an attacker from
introducing a malicious loader, or at least to
invoke it. That's why I think a simple "do not
use noexec whenever it hurts" is a bad option.

Not strictly related to the topic, but Denis, have
you tried "fmask" option to get rid of this?

This is not at all about executing the *binaries*
on tmpfs, and this is very important. What these
progs need is only to mmap a piece of a shared
memory with the PROT_EXEC permission. Nothing more.
Previously, noexec did not prevent this. Now it does.
What is worse, it prevents this also for MAP_PRIVATE.
This is really something I cannot understand.
The "ro" option doesn't prevent PROT_WRITE for MAP_PRIVATE,
thats the known fact.
