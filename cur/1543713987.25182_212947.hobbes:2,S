Maybe not to you but it does make a big difference on our 500 disk setup.
At the moment we use dd to do an initial sniff, then ext3 utils to do
O_DIRECT reads/writes. With O_DIRECT read/write in dd we could use it
instead. (We are basically interested in IO performance that a database
would see).

When you start hitting memory bandwidth limits, O_DIRECT will help you.
Sure it wont be an issue for your dd copy scenario, but I wanted to point
out there are other valid uses for it.
