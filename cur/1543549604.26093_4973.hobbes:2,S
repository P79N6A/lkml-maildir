The "->id" field has nothing to do with the device ID number, it's a
"which codec is this" field, and is zero for the master ac97 codec. See
how it is used - it's basically used mostly as
	if (codec->id) {
		... handle secondary codec case ...
and thus the change to ac97_codec.c completely broke most all codec
handling because suddenly all codec were "secondary".
Yeah, it's probably bad naming - it should probably use something like
"codex->index" instead of "codec->id".
But I'm surprised that it works at all in 2.2.x - that implies that the
2.2.x code is completely different from the 2.4.x logic.
