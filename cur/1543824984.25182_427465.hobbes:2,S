Definitely not.  I've repeatedly explained (and just done so again) why 
this is very wrong.  And you should know why, too, Mark ;-)
The controller resume (ata_pci_device_resume) does nothing 
controller-specific.  More importantly, the controller does not resume 
the ATA bus, and bring the ATA bus to bus-idle state.
