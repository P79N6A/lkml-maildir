0 - OK
1 - I am busy, give me it later.
If you return 1 be sure to netif_stop_queue. The netif_wake_queue will
continue transmission

There is not. You can expect just about every packet to be 16bit aligned

total and specific error.
dropped - not sure. Its not a precise science since cards vary
themselves how their hardware accounts such things

Try again ? If that fails I guess you initiate the self destruct
sequence for just that driver.
