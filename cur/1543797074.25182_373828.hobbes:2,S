Sorry, I fail to mention that I'm comparing two pages that are read in at the
same time, therefore they are in the same place in inactive_list. But their
re-access time can be quite different.
There are roughly two kinds of reads: almost instantly and slowly forward. For
the former one, read-in-time = first-access-time, unless for initial cache misses.
The latter one is the original purpose of of the patch: to keep one chunk of
read-ahead pages together, instead of let them littering throughout the lru
list.

Thanks to notice it. It will happen in the direct page reclaim path. But I have
just made interesting tests of the patch, in which direct page reclaims were
reduced to zero. Till now I have no hint of why this is happening :)
