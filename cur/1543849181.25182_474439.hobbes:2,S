The reason that an active job could not be made a sched domain when
its cpus overlapped an inactive job is that the cpu_exclusive rules
forbid any cpu_exclusive cpuset overlapping any sibling cpuset.
However ... this is basically just confirming for me my suspicion
that the Cpuset folks don't grok Sched Domains, and vice versa.
Time to remove this linkage between them that no one really understands
from both sides, and that apparently is broken and not safely usable.
Once I catch up on todays email, I will send out a patch to remove
this code linking cpuset cpu_exclusive to sched domains, replacing
it with a much simpler mechanism allowing for runtime control of
the cpu_isolated_map
