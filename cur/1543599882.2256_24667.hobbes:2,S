Greetings,
Enclosed is a patch to update/include the virtual iSeries device drivers. This
patch is against 2.4.9-ac5.
Both the ppc32 and ppc64 architectures are now supported.
In these device drivers are support for:
Virtual Ethernet
Virtual Harddrive (or DASD in IBM parlance)
Virtual Tape
Virtual CD
Rather than clog up the email system, please pick up the patch from:
ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/tgall/iSeriesDDvs2.4.9-ac5.patch.gz
Regards,
Tom
