Subject: No sound on SB line2 anymore?

Since 2.4.0-test5, line2 on my Soundblaster 128 soundcard, which is
connected to on my hauppauge winTV/pci TV card has been silent.
I sure have turned line2 on with a mixer program.
The external line connector sounds OK.

Currently I'm using xawtv:
This is xawtv-3.30, running on Linux/i686 (2.4.1-ac6)
In .xawtv I have:
mixer   = line2
It seems to both aumix and xawtv that there is a mixer there,
but no sound comes out, even when line2 is on, and volume=100%.
Otherwise the sound card works fine.
What's up?
