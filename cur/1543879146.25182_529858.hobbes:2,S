Go and grab it from 
http://www.bacula.org
, I'm pretty sure there are
RPMs available on there.  You might also need to install seperate RPMs
for the follwoing packages:
	bacula-common
	bacula-director
	bacula-sd
	bacula-fd
	bacula-console
	bacula-mysql
Oh yeah, bacula really wants to use an SQL DB for it's file index.  So
I'd strongly suggest you go and read the manual,which is quite
complete, before you do anything else.
Feel free to contact me off-list for help, or join the bacula-users
list.  We're a bit off topic for LKML now...
