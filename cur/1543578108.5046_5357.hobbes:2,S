Do the math again: for transmitting a single page in a kiobuf only 64
bytes needs to be initialized.  If map_array is moved to the end of the
structure, that's all contiguous data and is a single cacheline.
What you're completely ignoring is that sendpages is lacking a huge amount
of functionality that is *needed*.  I can't implement clean async io on
top of sendpages -- it'll require keeping 1 task around per outstanding
io, which is exactly the bottleneck we're trying to work around.

It does waste a significant amount of CPU cycles trying to reassemble io
requests and is not deterministic.  Unplugging the io queue is a real pain
with async io.
