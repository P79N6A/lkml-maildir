My main point about these comments is that you stated in a message a few
days ago that you would fix these issues before trying to submit the
code for inclusion in the kernel.  As you can imagine, I was a bit
surprised to see them not fixed in this release you were proposing to be
included in the main tree :)

Note, this is just my opinion of how to use BitKeeper, not the "rule":
You can use BitKeeper for kernel development in two ways:
	- as a tree to work out of, accepting changes and doing
	  incremental things all along the way, including merging with
	  the main releases.
	- or as a way to send changes to a maintainer.
I don't think you can really have it both ways, like you are trying to
do here.  Your repository contains 138 changesets that are not in the
main tree.  That's not a nice thing to try to make someone pull from (I
know in my USB work, I sure wouldn't do that.)
It's much nicer (this is just my opinion as a maintainer who uses
BitKeeper, I don't speak for Linus) to be presented with a tree to pull
from that _only_ contains a small number of changes.  Not 138 different
changes.
So I recommend you use two BitKeeper trees.  One to do your work out of
(much like the one you have today), and one that you use to send changes
to other people with.  I know the JFS group does it this way, if you
want to see another example besides the USB group.

Thank you, that sounds like a much saner approach.
