You could assign the pointer to a const default_sdhci_ops structure,
which IMHO would be cleaner than copying the function pointers
separately.

I doubt that this is even measurable. If it was, you could still use a copy
of that structure, like
struct sdhci_host {
	...
	struct sdhci_ops ops; /* not struct sdhci_ops *ops */
	...
};
and do an assignment of the structure, like
static void assign_ops(struct sdhci_host *host, struct sdhci_ops *ops)
{
	host->ops = *ops;
}
