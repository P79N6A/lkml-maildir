Hi,
after some tiny fixes to reiserfs and the makefile for prep bootfile 
(using ../lib/lib.a vs. ../lib/libz.a) I managed to succesfully compile 
a kernel. It even boots to the point where it frees unused kernel memory 
and then stops... this includes succesfully mounting the root 
filesystem...
Just to let the world know what does and doesn't work on my powerstack 
mobo.
