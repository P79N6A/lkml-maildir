Looks good, thanks.
I've got a W83697H*F* here on a VIA motherboard,
which is the same from a watchdog point of view.
It is on port 0x2e though.
Is 0x4e a good default?
Is W83697HG a good name?
Note I've CC'd Wim Van Sebroeck who is the watchdog tree maintainer.
I noticed you didn't include the check that's in the
W83627HF driver to reset the timeout if already running
from the BIOS. This was because some BIOS set the timeout
to 4 minutes for example, so when the driver was loaded
and reset the mode to seconds, the machine rebooted
before the init scripts could run and start the userspace
watchdog daemon.
cheers,
Pádraig.
