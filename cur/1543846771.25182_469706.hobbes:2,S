My personal hard data is:
- if you are sending emails to me, the fourth-last mail server in the
  path (the one that actually receives the emails from the Internet)
  does greylisting, IOW much spam that can be trivially determined is
  already eliminated when bogofilter gets the emails
- much spam I'm getting cames through lists like linux-kernel that
  have already filtered out the easy to determine spam
- despite these points, bogofilter catches 90% of the arriving spam
- one false positive every 1-2 years (sic)
- I can (and do) train bogofilter myself
It might have it's weaknesses and might therefore not work well forever,
but at least during the last years bogofilter served me well.
