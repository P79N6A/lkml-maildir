I thought the general consensus was it is OK for now (as a first go) to
have scsi only multi-path, I have not heard anyone say don't do scsi
multi-path. And then later (maybe after we have more than one subsystem
supporting multi-path IO) we can add general multi-path support into the
layers above scsi.
In any case, md or volume manager based multi-path solutions are good
alternatives.
I have recently ported the scsi multi-path patch to 2.5.59, but haven't
posted patches.
The current multi-path patch still needs at least two major changes in
scsi: error recovery (scsi_error.c) that allows other paths to be used
without long delays, and a per-device queue_lock versus the current
per-host queue_lock.
Hopefully we can get underlying changes for those last two into 2.5 (and
maybe someday the multi-path patch), as they are improvements to scsi with
or without multi-path.
