Good question. The preferred procedure depends on your viewpoint on
disclosure
vendor-sec@lst.de is a cross vendor security list and a good place for
stuff. It will deal with both public and date embargoed security
information. security@[your-vendor] should work for most responsible
vendors and may be more appropriate if it involves a vendor kernel that
may have bugs not in the base tree. 
For stuff in -bk kernel snapshots and the like that isn't in the
production kernels then I'd start by mailing Linus/(Andrew for -mm) or
the list.
