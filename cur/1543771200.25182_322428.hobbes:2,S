There's a significant number of local_irq_disable across the kernel, I
don't see why should we risk a driver update possibly looping a bit too
logn, to break the RT guarantee. It's not too hard to reach the hundred
usec range when doing hardware operations in inefficient drivers when
touchign the mmio/io regions. That would not be a bug in any config but
preempt-RT. Possibly not nice, but not a bug (keep in mind the usb irq
in my firewall for whatever reasons keeps irq disabled for >1msec).

Using cli by hand never happens anywhere, while if you grep for
local_irq_disable that happens in many drivers.
Using cli in asm is like doing memset() all over the ram... then kernel
will crash and irq will stop too ;) While local_irq_disable os far was a
supported API for drivers and generic kernel code (most commmonly used
before touching per-cpu data structures, so very common in certain part
of the kernels, including the scheduler).
