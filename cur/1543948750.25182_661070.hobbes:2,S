Come on Ingo. You make it sounds like it's radically different solution.
At the end of the day we have a bitmap that represents which CPUs can be used 
for the kernel stuff. How is that different ?
I was saying all along that cpusets is a higher level API and was discussing 
or trying to discuss (people were ignoring my questions) ways to integrate it.

Hmm, that was easy. Not a single ack. Even the core part is not complete yet. 
I pointed out several issues. Like the fact that it does not provide full 
isolation because it does not move timers, does not handle workqueues.
I did not even get a chance to test this stuff properly and see if it actually 
solves the usecase I was solving with my patches.
_Obviously_ we could not have taken my tested solution and evolved it in the 
direction people wanted to see it evolve, ie integration with the cpusets :(.
My main concern is that it introduces a whole new set of notifiers that 
perform similar functions to what CPU hotplut already does.
