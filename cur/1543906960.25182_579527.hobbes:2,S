Hi List,
    I would like to know why calling add_disk() from a kernel thread
which is running from a work_queue would cause the work item to block
with the "D" (disk wait) state at best under kernel 2.6.17 and cause a
hard-lockup on kernel 2.6.22.1?
    If I    recall correctly, work items running on the work_queue are
allowed to sleep, and add_disk() is known to sleep.  Did I miss out
some details such as a lock I have to acquire?
    Hope to hear a reply soon.
Regards,
Othello
