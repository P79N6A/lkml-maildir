Well, under 2.2.6 spin_lock and spin_unlock in the non SMP case are
NOOPS (do { } while(0)). This is not what I want.
I understand that semaphores probably aren't the appropriate thing to
use here, but there doesn't seem to be a true mutex style construct.
Plus that fact they initialize semaphore's with MUTEX definately is
confusing.
I guess what I want are spinlocks, but the kernel spinlock
implementation seems to be created for protecting across multiple CPU's,
not across multiple context's of execution (thread's)
