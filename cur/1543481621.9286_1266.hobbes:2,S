I found the problem, but I don't know how it happends. Your ioctl()
works fine if I make a simple 10-line program to set the speed.
The problem is that after a fork(), the termios structure somehow
gets modified. I don't know how because the structure is never used
again by the parent. In fact, if I move it off the stack, out of
local data, into global, everything works fine. 
This is weird because everything works fine anywhere if the speed is
38400 or less. There are also no local variables larger than an `int`
(no string buffers or longs) that could be overwriting the termios
structure on the stack.
