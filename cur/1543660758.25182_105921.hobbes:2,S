Drivers for older hardware like this are more than likely unmaintained, 
and suffer from bit-rot.  I don't have this hardware, but I can offer a 
bit of analysis to help you debug this further.  From the oops message 
in your previous email, it looks like the oops occurred on line 1326 of 
cdu31a.c.  From the stack dump, I can see that input_data was called 
with bytesleft=0x4000.  This caused readahead_buffer + bytesleft to go 
past the end of the module and oops.
