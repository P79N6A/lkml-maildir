	By figuring which  LONG LONG division you have (64 by 32, or some
	such).  If you can replace it with suitable shift-right (which
	is equivalent of division by a power of two), you will get both
	code without that extra *intentionally* unsupported gcc internal
	library call, and very likely faster code than any other way to
	code it.
	Could you give pointer to the source ?
	And do also mention which kernel version you are using as your
	compilation environment.
