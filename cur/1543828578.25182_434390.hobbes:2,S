Actually, posting that _was_ useful - staring at the above got me to
realize that git clone -l -s -n + git fetch + git log + rm -rf would
work just fine and be much faster than the variant above...
Still, that looks like excessive from server, if nothing else.  Is there
a better way to do it?  Getting remote log, that is, preferably with
a way to get it starting at the point I have in local tree.
