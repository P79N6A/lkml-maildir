Actaully, the EIP should not be changed (since it already points to the 
intruction following INT 0x80) and I believe it is sufficent to replace 
the test for _TIF_SYSCALL_TRACE with (_TIF_SYSCALL_TRACE | TIF_SINGLESTEP) 
in the system call return path. This should generate a ptrace trap with 
EIP pointing to the next instruction following INT 0x80.
