Umm, hdx or sdx is a small impact. The real power of /dev/disk is that 
not-so-technically minded users can go looking for their disk by its name 
(or less frequently, by their address (e.g. USB drive)). Especially 
important since any new disk discovered in the scsi layer gets the next 
free slot.
