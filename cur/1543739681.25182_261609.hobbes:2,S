Hi all, 
I don't know if this is the right place to post this, so feel free
to send me the right address. 
I just buy a Netgear Wifi USB stick (MA111v2). The previous 
version of this stick (v1) is compliant with wlang-ng, but this
new serie use SiS 162 chipset. 
After a little googling, i found that SiS supply a kernel module
(a .c wrapper + a binary .o) at 
http://driver3.sis.com/linux/wlan/
This kernel module isn't compliant w/ the kernel 2.6.X. I'm not 
a kernel guru, but it seems to use a old task queue and irq handling. 
While this piece of code should'nt take too much work to port 
on a recent kernel, I'm wondering what to do. In fact the copyright
notice is:  Copyright (c) Silicon Intergrated System Inc. That's all ..
So I guess this couldn't be integrated in kernel ? 
So my question is: In this special case, what should I do ? 
(I 'm unable to find a contact a SiS ..)
Thanks for any help 
(apologize for my awfull english .. )
