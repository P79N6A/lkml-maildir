IMHO it's even simpler than that. You already announce release candidates
with what you intend to push into next -stable. Those who complain that
-stable breaks on them just get what they deserve. They're free to announce
the problem and even provide a patch in order to fix the problem in next
-stable ASAP, but I find it a bit easy to complain about the -stable team
that some fixes break a few rarely tested pieces of software !
I'd prefer that we get slightly more -stable releases with a few ones
potentially wrong on rare occasions, than fewer ones which get released
only once everyone agrees (ie mostly never).

I have one right here serving my web pages, but I have to check that
my toolchain is still OK (I don't build on it - 32 MB, NFS root). You
don't know what you're missing :-)
