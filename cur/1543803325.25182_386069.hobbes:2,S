Okay.
Had a look at the source but it is difficult to track the indirection, 
I gave up ;)  After all, performance-wise the old driver is okay, just 
odd accounting.  Annoying to know there's a missing (harmless) indirection
in the module case but I don't have a clue where to look for it.

Minor nit: lsmod shows zero when two e100-3.5.10 in use.
