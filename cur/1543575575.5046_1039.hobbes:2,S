Linus, please do not apply.
User space applications _must_ not include kernel headers.  Even
modutils does not include linux/module.h, it has its own portable
(kernels 2.0 - 2.4) version.
I have strongly recommended to the sysklogd maintainers that they strip
all the symbol handling from klogd.  The oops decoding in klogd is
hopelessly out of date and broken.
