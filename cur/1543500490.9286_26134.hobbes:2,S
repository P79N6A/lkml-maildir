Oops... I posted a damaged patch. :-(.
It is incomplete (Thank you for notice, Borislav)
Sorry! 1024 apologies!!!
Here is the complete variant.
                         Best regards.
                                         Alexander.
P.S. I need some feedback.

I currently think on block-request, netdev, FS and symbol interceptors.
