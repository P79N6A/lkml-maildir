That would get him out of trouble.  But it certainly makes _sense_ for the
kernel to implement MADV_WILLNEED for anon memory.  From a consistency POV.
But I don't know that the usefulness of the feature is worth actually
expending code on.  Heck, after five-odd years I'm still asking every
second person I meet "why don't you use fadvise()?"  (Reponse: ooooh!)
