This argument half-convinced me that support for rsize>4k is needed
for the Solaris case. I've therefore implemented it in the latest
version (0.7.0) of the NFSv3 patches:
Basically, if you have rsize>4k, each call to the asynchronous read
routine will now attempt to read up to (rsize+PAGE_SIZE-1)/PAGE_SIZE
bytes into the page cache where it will be found by the normal
readahead code. (This affects both the NFSv2 and the NFSv3 code.)
 Please could Andrew and others who've been seeing slow reading wrt
Solaris machines test this code out. If it makes no difference, I'll
scrap it...
Cheers,
  Trond
