There is.  1) Unreferenced process space page gets unmapped, goes on to LRU 
lists 2) page aged down to zero until it gets deactivated 3) page deactivated 
and evicted soon after.  If the page is referenced during (2) or (3) it will 
be mapped back in, no IO because it's still in the swap cache (minor fault).
But this is lopsided and hard to balance.  Also, unmapping/remapping is an 
expensive way to check for short-term page activity.

This is useless without rmap because the page will just be aged down, not up. 
With rmap, yes, that's what needs to be done.
