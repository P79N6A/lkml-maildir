I think msleep_interruptible(30000) would be your best choice, then. 
Maybe with a comment that you don't actually expect signals, but are
using TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE to avoid contributing to load average (that
way, if the loadavg calculation changes someday, somebody will be able
to change your sleep over appropriately).
