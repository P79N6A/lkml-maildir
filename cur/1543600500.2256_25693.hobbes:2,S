So you actually say "make it the way BSD does, because that's what we
know and support". Sheesh. Why don't you just use Netlink and start
preaching to the BSD and Solaris folks that "this is the way how it
should be done". I'd say there are more Linux machines than BSD and
Solaris combined out there.
With this attitude, why don't you program WIN32? It's even more
widespread.
And Mr. Veenema has the guts to talk about "superiority complex"? Please.
If you want to write Software for Platform "L", use the APIs of
platform "L", not the legacy compatibility layer that "L" has to
support some old "B" applications. With this attitude you will be
stuck with "B" applications for the next twenty years. Or until "B"
decides to change its API when you will come running to the "A"
authors to demand that they must now change their legacy API to
support "B+".
