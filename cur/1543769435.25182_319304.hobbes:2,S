Firstly, there isn't much below brk() at all.  Secondly, do we
really want to fill the randomized hole between the executable
and the brk area with data ?
Thirdly, we do want to continue detecting NULL pointer dereferences
inside large structs, ie. dereferencing an element 700kB into some
large struct...
