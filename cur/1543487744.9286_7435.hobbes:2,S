I think the un*x way is to have a sound server processs manage the
different sound sources from userspace, and have only the sound server
talk directly to the kernel drivers.  Of course, all programs which talk
directly to /dev/dsp would have to be recoded to use the sound server
library and API.
This way you can make your sound server as complex as you want (i.e. 
prioritize sounds events, "real-time" mixing of channels, etc), without
adding cruft to the kernel.  Latency could be a problem with games
though...  I know I've seen work done in this direction, but don't have
any links handy.
	Cheers,
