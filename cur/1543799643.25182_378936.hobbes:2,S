On IA64, the "sync" instructions are actually part of the ld.acq ot st.rel
instructions that are used to set/clear spinlocks.
The program order of the instructions is:
        cmpxchg.acq             // set lock
          ..
          .. do things
          ..
        st.rel                  // release lock
        st NULL -> lock_ptr     // set flag to allow futex_q to be freed
IA64 implements fencing of ld.acq or st.rel instructions as one-directional
barriers.
For example, st.rel allows stores that FOLLOW the st.rel to be reordered
and become visible before the st.rel
(I hope this picture survives the various mailers)
        ld      |
        st      |   |        ^     ^
               - fence  -    |     |
        st.rel --------------|-----|------------------- fence
                             |     |
        ld                   |     |
        st                         |
I don't understand PPC64 but I suspect it has different memory ordering semantics.
