It needn't be that hard on s390, I believe you don't need to worry about
PTEs becoming asynchronous when stealing a page, since if I understand
the hypervisor architecture, there is a per-page mapping level
available, allowing you to generate discard faults on access.  It might
be possible to use this mapping layer without implementing a full blown
hypervisor.  Martin?
For x86, at discard time, you would have to manually walk and invalidate
any PTEs potentially mapping the discarded page, but there is already
this great thing called Xen paravirt-ops which actually does that for
completely different reasons (PT page protection).
I think a random exponential distribution for discard would be needed to
catch all the racey failure modes.
