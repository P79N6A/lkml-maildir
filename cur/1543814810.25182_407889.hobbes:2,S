It's not done "early", because at this point it's only needed for
drivers.  On i386 it's done "early" to catch some chipsets
(coincidentally, Dell).

Built 2.6.16-rc6-mm2 on ia64 Itanium2 (Dell PowerEdge 7250, aka Intel
Tiger4).  Compiled clean, loaded clean, works as expected.  Thanks!
I haven't tried same on x86_64 yet, will get to that ASAP.
Thanks,
