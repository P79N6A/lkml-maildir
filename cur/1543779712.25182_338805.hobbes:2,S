Well it was one of my finer moments, so don't be too hard on
yourself.

Well depends on what they want I suppose. Does it even make sense
to expose VM_FAULT_WRITE to arch code if it will just fall through
to VM_FAULT_MINOR?
With my earlier VM_FAULT_RACE thing, you can squint and say that's
a different case to VM_FAULT_MINOR - and accordingly not increment
the minor fault count. Afterall, minor faults *seem* to track count
of modifications made to the pte entry minus major faults, rather
than the number of times the hardware traps. I say this because we
increment the number in get_user_pages too.
But...

I agree that for the moment we probably just want something that
works. I'd be just as happy to go with your patch as is for now.
