It's obviously going to be faster. The kthread approach needs an IPI
*and* a context switch on the destination CPU.
For broadcast situations, it is also going to be faster, because it
can use platform specific broadcast IPIs 
The only weird atomicity requirements of smp_call_function is due to
its terribly unscalable design. Once you have the producer provide its
own data (or accept -ENOMEM failures), then there is no problem. It's
then even possible to use it from interrupt context with not too much
more work.

Also there is nothing wrong with improving the speed of the existing
implementation. The current smp_call_function is more or less unusable
for any real work because it is totally serialised.
Thanks for taking this patchset under your wing, Jens.
