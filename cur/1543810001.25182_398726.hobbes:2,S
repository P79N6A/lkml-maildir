Dear Sir,
Having consulted with my colleagues and based on the information gathered 
from the South African Chamber Of Commerce And Industry via the Information 
Exchange in Johannesburg, I have the privilege to request for your 
assistance to transfer the sum of $12,000,000.00 (Twelve
million United States dollars) into your accounts.
The above sum resulted from an over-invoiced contract,executed commissioned 
and paid for about
five(5)years ago by a foreign contractor. This action was however 
intentional and since then the fund has been in a suspense account at the 
South African Reserve Bank. We are now ready to transfer the fund overseas 
and that is where you come in. It is important to inform you that as civil 
servants, we are forbidden to operate a foreign account. That is why we 
require your assistance. The total sum will be shared as follows: 70% for 
us, 25%for you and 5% for local and international expenses incurred during 
the transfer. The transfer is risk free on both sides. I am a 
Director,Accounts with ARMSCOR,Arms Procurement Division of the Department 
of Defence here in South African Republic. If you find this proposal 
acceptable, we shall require the following documents:
(a) your banker's name, telephone,account and fax number.
(b) Your private telephone and fax numbers -- for confidentiality and easy 
communication.
(c) Your letter-headed paper stamped and signed.
Alternatively, we will furnish you with the text of what to type into your 
letter-headed paper, along with a breakdown explaining,comprehensively what 
we require of you. The business will take us fourteen (14) working days to 
accomplish.
Please reply urgently as soon as you read this mail.
Best regards
