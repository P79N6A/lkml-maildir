Oh, its even more interesting.  If the -print is not present find prints
out the name of the pruned directories.  If it is present it does not:
    vmware> find . -name tmpdir -prune -o -type d
    .
    ./tmpdir
    ./output
    vmware> find . -name tmpdir -prune -o -type d -print
    .
    ./output
