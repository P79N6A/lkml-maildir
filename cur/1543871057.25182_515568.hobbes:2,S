That was my thought as well, it looks like it's only needed for x86_64. We
don't look at binfmt->hasvdso on SH at all at least, and it works fine
there.. I left it in in the patch since I figured x86 had a reason for
checking it, but perhaps someone who knows the x86/x86_64 interaction
can comment on this.
