Yes, #ifdef CONFIG_DMI is not very comfortable. That why I proposed
things such as DECLARE_DMI_FIXUP_TABLE(), because it would force people
to use these macros, which would then be working correctly depending on
DMI=y/n. However, there's still the issue of driver_data that I
mentionned in my earlier post.
What should I do ? Option 1 ? Option 2 ? Give up with the patch ?
Thanks for your comments,
Thomas
