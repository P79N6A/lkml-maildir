I can confirm problems with serverworks OSB4 and UDMA. With UDMA and
a seagate disk you see 4 bytes repeat from one transfer into the next
shuffling all the data up 4 bytes (which since it includes inode and
metadata is *messy*). Current 2.4 has detect code that sometimes traps this
and panics to avoid fs death.
With MWDMA all was fine.
This was observed across a large number of boxes in a rendering farm so its
not a one off flawed box, and across two board vendors. I reported it to
serverworks who were interested but couldnt reproduce it in their lab.
