Linus and Michel,
Here is a proposed patch for fixing the compile-warning that shows up
when compiling radeon_state.c on a 64-bit platform (Itanium, in my
case).  According to Michel, RADEON_PARAM_SAREA_HANDLE is used only on
embedded platforms and since it is not possible to fix the problem
without breaking backwards-compatibility for those platforms, the
interim fix is to simply desupport this particular ioctl() on 64-bit
platforms (i.e., make it fail with EINVAL).
If there are no objections, please apply.
