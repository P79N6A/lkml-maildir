Related question: are there any 100Mbit NICs with cpu's onboard?
Something mainstream/affordable?(i.e. not 1G ethernet)
Just recently someone posted asking some technical question about
ARMlinux for and intel card with 2 1G ports, 8 100M ports,
an onboard ARM cpu and 4 other uControllers... seems to me
that ultimately the networking code should go in that direction:
immagine having the *NIC* do most of this... no cache pollution problems...
