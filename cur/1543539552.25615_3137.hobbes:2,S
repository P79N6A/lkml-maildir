BUCK means to kick back the command as invalid or bad.
RODEO you get BUCKED off a horse or bull if you do not hang on correctly.

I do not have to some script-kiddie will do it on their own now.
The only option is to protect against it now.
Since no one trusted that, I know what I am doing and required full
disclosure before I could complete the protection, we have to suffer the
outcome and work to prevent it now.
The merits are that it prevents you (ROOT included) from doing thinks that
violate the SPEC that the sub-system must follow to comply with the
hardware.  You will now argue that I have no right to impose such rules.
With is view, screw everyone!  All you paranoid unix children that think
you as sysadmin are all knowledgeble and afraid to give up control of what
you never knew you could do, in such a clean way, need to grow a little.
I have now given you the handgrende, pulled the pin and threw it away and
will now walk away.  Your choice is to use the steel-plate-armor I left
you as a sheild or DIE......I really do not care!
I offered you the sheild and you turned it down.
A script-kiddie would just laugh and watch, because they knew about it
before me and you are luck their pipe bombs are duds.
