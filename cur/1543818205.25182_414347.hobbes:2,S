Gotcha, I see that I am misinterpreting CPOL/CPHA so I'll fix that up.

Yeah, forgot to run sparse the first time.

Good catch, I had it testing bits_per_word directly before.   
Actually, we support 4-bit to 16-bit, and 32-bit transfers.

Right.  However, do you think its really necessary to implement my  
own spi_setup(), spi_bitbang_setup() is going to call my  
setup_transfer() which will do the range checking for me (and I'll  
need range checking in transfer_setup() anyways).

Maybe I'm missing where the polling is occurring now, but I felt like  
I was effectively doing what you are describing.
