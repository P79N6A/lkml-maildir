Dbench (1 disk, x440 8 real cpus, 16 HT ones)
before: 
Throughput 265.032 MB/sec (NB=331.29 MB/sec  2650.32 MBit/sec)  256 procs
after:
Throughput 381.964 MB/sec (NB=477.454 MB/sec  3819.64 MBit/sec)  256 procs
(I took the second run, first ones are slower, seems to be stable after)
NUMA-Q 16-way (1 disk. 16 cpus)
before:
Throughput 48.5304 MB/sec (NB=60.663 MB/sec  485.304 MBit/sec)  256 procs
after:
Throughput 58.8483 MB/sec (NB=73.5603 MB/sec  588.483 MBit/sec)  256 procs
NUMA-Q has slower disks, old adaptors, and a slow cross-node interconnect.
