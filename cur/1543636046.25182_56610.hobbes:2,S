But that's just _wrong_.
There _is_ a sane way to get the per-arch constant, and there has been for 
a long long time.
The kernel exports it with the AT_CLKTCK ELF auxiliary note to every ELF
binary ever loaded, and I think glibc in turn exports that value through
the regular sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK) thing. (Yeah, I disagree with some of the
glibc sysconf implementation, but it sure should be there, and it's
documented).
If that doesn't work, then it's a glibc bug (well, in theory there could
be a kernel bug too, but since it's a one-liner in the kernel I really
doubt it).
