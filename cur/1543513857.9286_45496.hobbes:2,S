Note Alan, that you didn't merged the patch I proposed. As you can see
from the quoted email, the patch I proposed you was "zmagic-only-fix" that
looks like this:

and zmagic-only-fix is an obviously right one liner that will only fix a
bug.

You instead included into 2.2.13pre18 another patch called "zmagic-5" and
that's other stuff and I have not proposed it for inclusion into the
official 2.2.13.

./patches/v2.2/2.2.13pre17/zmagic-5.gz
Maybe you did a browse of my ftp area and you find out zmagic-5.gz and you
applyed it thinking it was the zmagic-only-fix patch? Unfortunately
zmagic-5 was still code under testing in beta release (I considered it
right, but this is another story).
Of course the name was similar (as both the two patches plays with zmagic
stuff) but the "only-fix" was a very small _subset_ of the zmagic-5 patch
and I generated the "only-fix" exactly to only fix the bug fast just in
2.2.13 without adding new features.
When I seen my zmagic-5 in the pre18 I thought "hug, strange, how can
zmagic-5 be in the pre patches? Probably Alan is interested in such
fature and agreed with the code.".
I'll go into the zmagic-5 reports now and I'll provide a fix (or I'll
simply confirm as the right one one of the fixes just present on the
list). I'll at least take advantage of this additional (not expeted)
testing of the zmagic-5 patch, to be more productive. Then I'll port the
fixes to 2.3.x as well later.
