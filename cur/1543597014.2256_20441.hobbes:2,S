The BUG() invocation is a result of invalid flags being passed to
kmem_cache_grow().
The numeric values associated with things like GFP_ATOMIC changed in
2.4.6.  Your problem is likely related to the use of modules built on
something other than the kernel you're running.
(I know this because I spent entirely too long debugging somebody's
code yesterday that thought it was a good idea to have his own copies
of the definitions of GFP_ATOMIC, et al.)
