Yep. I figure on submitting it to Linus once 2.3 comes out.
BTW: it's also got support for Cyrix MII. The registers are different
for Pentium, P6 too. I guess that's why they call it "model-specific".

Agreed. I think we need all these different measuring facilities.

When I get time and/or patches, I'll roll in support for these as
well. The interface I've developed is quite generic. There's a not
insignificant chance that MIPS support will come soonish because I
suspect my next job will lumber me with an SGI.
