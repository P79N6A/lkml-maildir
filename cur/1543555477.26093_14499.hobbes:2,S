Thanks for the patch... but it does not quite work. It applies cleanly, 
but upon booting the patched kernel, the machine freezes completely upon 
PCMCIA initialisation (it got to the point where the init script said 
'Loading modules' then nothing). CTRL+ALT+DEL does not work, either.
Anyone got a clue? Would love to help debug this if someone would just 
walk me through it.
