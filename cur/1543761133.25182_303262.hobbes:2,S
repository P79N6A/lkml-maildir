Well, currently, in x86 systems it causes wall clock to advance a very well 
defined amount.  That it is not exactly 1/HZ is something we need to live with...

I think your overlooking timers.  We have a given resolution for timers and some 
code, at least, expects timers to run with that resolution.  This REQUIRES 
interrupts at resolution frequency.  We can argue about what that interrupt 
event is called (currently a jiffies interrupt) and disparage the fact that 
hardware can not give us "nice" numbers for the resolution, but we do need the 
interrupts.  That there are bad places in the code where interrupts are delayed 
is not really important in this discussion.  For what it worth, the RT patch 
Ingo is working on is getting latencies down in the 10s of microseconds region.
We also need, IMNSHO to recognize that, at lest with some hardware, that 
interrupt IS in fact the clock and is the only reasonable way we have of reading 
it.  This is true, for example, on the x86.  The TSC we use as a fill in for 
between interrupts is not stable in the long term and should only be used to 
interpolate over 1 to 10 ticks or so.

This is also what is done in things like posix timers.  The fact remains that, 
at least in the posix timers case, the resolution is exported to the user and 
implies certain things.  I am not sure we are explicitly exporting the 
resolution in the kernel, but, down under the code, there is a resolution AND it 
impacts what one should expect of timers.

It may help to understand that MOST internal timers (i.e. timers the kernel 
sets) never expire.  They are canceled by the caller because they were really 
"dead man" timers, i.e. "it better happen be this time or we are hurting".
Users, on the other hand, for the most part set up timers to allow bits of code 
to run either periodically or at some specified time.  These are the folks who 
care about latency and being on time.
User also, of course, also use "dead man" timers such as, for example, the time 
out on select.  By their nature the "dead man" timer, usually, does not have 
strict on time requirements.
