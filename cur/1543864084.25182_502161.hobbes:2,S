It's an interface which has been available on other platforms forever
(lutimes, not lutimesat).  If it can be implemented correctly on the
interesting file systems I'd say "go ahead", it can only be useful and
have more benefits than the probably small cost of implementing it.
If on the other hand important filesystems cannot support lutimes then
I'd wait with introducing the syscall at least until the support is
added.  It much easier to cope with unavailable syscalls then it is with
partially working ones.
