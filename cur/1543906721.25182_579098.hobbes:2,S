I don't think there is an unfairness problem. We are looping only
if timer->base changes in between. IOW, there is no "lock + unlock
+ lock(same_lock)" here, we take another lock on each iteration.

All traces start from schedule_timeout()->mod_timer(). This timer
is local, nobody can see it, its ->base can't be NULL or changed.
This means that lock_timer_base() can't loop, but can't take the
tvec_t_base_s.lock. But in that case the trace should different,
strange.
