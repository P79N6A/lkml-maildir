But, I am now seeing some errors that weren't there in 2.6.23
kernel: bttv0: SCERR @ 1fa0401c,bits: HSYNC OFLOW SCERR*
last message repeated 15 times
kernel: bttv0: timeout: drop=16 irq=105615/105615, risc=1fa0401c,
bits: HSYNC OFLOW
kernel: bttv0: reset, reinitialize
kernel: bttv0: PLL can sleep, using XTAL (28636363).

These happen occasionally and it causes an EIO DQBUF
error and the application has to re queue the buffers but it
recovers OK. Not sure if it causes some sort of internal
kernel corruption that will only be noticed later possibly?
I am using 15 userptr buffers so whatever is happening may
be happening once per buffer sometimes. dunno
