He removed the marker to make it clear that is not meant to be used by
non GPL modules and is an internal helper function. Its really to my
mind no different to changing the text of the license - someone elses license -
to delete the linking rules. Even if the change is not valid is misleads
and confuses and is extremely impolite.

He's misleading people and contributing to future infringements. The _GPL
marker is correct, and it is there to assist people like Veritas by telling
them "excuse me this one is not for you". Note that there are higher level
interfaces using it which genuinely do seem to be needed by seperate works
and are not EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL, as well as others like the Video4Linux buffer
helper logic which is very much a support library.

Actually it does. EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL is a digital rights management system
subverting it is a US offence. Now if anyone was to go cart Andrea off to
jail for that I'd be pretty pissed off. Its stupidity factor is stunningly
high but it doesn't change the reality. Nor for that matter should anyone
forget that stupid laws can be used for good as well as evil some times 8)

It makes it clear what it is usable by. I don't as such consider it a 
misnomer. Now EXPORT_SYMBOL_INTERNAL would be a godsend for a lot of other
stuff. It would help binary folks and a lot of GPL driver folks know that
they were sticking their nose in the wrong spot and might get burned. At
that point they can make an intelligent assessment. Maybe they do need to
stick their noses in, maybe they should look at the right approach.
However _GPL and _INTERNAL are two different things. Linus has said he won't
allow people to go around removing existing symbols people rely on. Its not
quite my own viewpoint but Linus argues quite reasonably that he has at least
a moral reason to not go around screwing people and its his toy.

sound good. Its sort of a lint for driver authors. I support the addition
of _INTERNAL as _well_ as _GPL completely. Although maybe at that point its
time to think about EXPORT_SYMBOL(name, attributes) before Keith Owens goes
missing in a combinatorial explosion.
