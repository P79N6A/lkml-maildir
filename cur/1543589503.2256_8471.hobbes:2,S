We will have to live with 2.4 until 2.6, 'cause 2.5 will not be stable.
2.4 will be the stable and non "brain damaged" kernel in distros.
So every thing that can make 2.4 more clean, better. Think in 2.4.57,
and we still are in 4. And feature backports, and new drivers...
The 2.5 rewrite is not excuse. The knowledge on the actual state, yes.
