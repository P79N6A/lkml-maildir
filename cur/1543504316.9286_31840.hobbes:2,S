Hello,
I wrote a simple network filesystem which uses RPC in userland.
I also wrote a VFS version as a loadable kernel module,
which compiles fine until I include the RPC code.
Once I include <rpc/rpc.h> together with <linux/locks.h> I get many
errors about redefining struct, const etc...  I cannot compile <rpc/rpc.h>
and <linux/locks.h> together without this happening,
and I need both.
I have kernel 2.0.32.
I noticed that kernel 2.2.x has many updates, including a kernel nfs server
and updates to the RPC code.  Also updates to the VFS.
Will upgrading solve this problem?
If so, will I have to re-write the VFS/RPC code for the newer kernel.
Is there an quicker solution than upgrading?
