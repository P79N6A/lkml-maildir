Hans, we had this discussion before.  And the consensus was pretty simple:
the disk structure plugins are your business and fine to keep.  The
higher-level pluging that just add another useless abstraction below
file_operation/inode_operation/etc.  are not.  keep the former and kill
the latter and you're one step further.
