A UID based role system re-implements the all powerful root login. It does
however, allow moving that user to a non "root" name, but that can also be
done just by changing the login name of the root user. This does not
improve the current foundation, which is desired.
By least privilege - no user is all powerful.
To make the system usable, there must be a way to gain the necessary
privileges. To gain a particular privilege requires some way to authenticate
the user before granting the higher privilege. UID alone is not enough -
consider a cron job - should it have the same privileges as the user via an
interactive login where questions may be asked/answered? There are pros/cons
here that significantly affect the result. Both answers have been done -
Under UNICOS, my cron job cannot install privileged software; even though
I (via an interactive login) am. This is because the potential violation may
request additional authentication (ie. a password). If the cron job accepts
a password from the input stream, that means I have put a sensitive piece
of data (the password) in an unsecured location.

I think so. The PAL implementation is only used to extend the definition of
setuid - If the PAL definition doesn't allow setuid, then the program is
NOT setuid, even if the setuid bit is set. As far as I have been able to see,
this is the effect - more bits that work like the setuid bit does. Instead
of switching UID, it gains the privilege associated with the specified bit(s).
This allows extreme segmentation of privilege.

This is re-implementing the "setuid to xyz" facility in a capability (as
assigned to a UID) system. I don't think it is as strong as a capability/inode
reference. No user can accidentially (even indirectly) gain a privlege that
is not explicitly assigned. This is NOT to say "privileges/capabilies" are
not assigned to a UID. It is not done explicitly. The assignment only says
"this uid is allowed to use the specified capabilities". The capabilities are
not allways on. The combination of inode capabilities must be matched against
the "allowed" capabilities. I realize this appears to contradict the inode
reference - I think this is where the "forced" capabilities come into play.
I think the "forced" capabilities permit totally unprivileged users to
accomplish something that does require privilege - such as changing a password.
It doesn't grant the ability to change just any password; only the password
of the user using the passwd utility, even then the user must provide the
old password. Changing any password requires additional capabilities/role
definition (such as security administrator - there may be several capabilities
used to define the role of security admin).
