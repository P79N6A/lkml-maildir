Hi,
I tried the various suggestions from the last mails, but nothing of 
that worked. --verbose did not return anything useful. It's the kernel 
module that returns -EHOSTDOWN.
...
Eventually I found out that this one works:
	mount.cifs //cl0/c /mnt -o servernetbiosname=CL0
So what did I change? Casing. Note that "CL0" is entirely uppercase. 
Although strange, it actually coincides with how LANMAN works. 
Everything is uppercased in lanman, hostnames, usernames, heck, even 
plaintext passwords (samba-smbd has a good time trying a ton of 
combinations in such setups).
No other options like sec=none or thelike were needed. Login as 
anonymous worked directly.
Please consider updating the cifs kernel module to account for the LM 
oddity of uppercasing things. (Then, smbfs can finally be ripped out I 
hope.)
Jan
