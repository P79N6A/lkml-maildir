Is there anyone in kernelland who is tackling this? I'm currently in the 
throes of recompiling everything with -march=pentium3 -O2 to see if these 
simple flags make a difference (as I reiterate, Windoze XP works without 
problem). I refuse to believe that I will have to use XP in order to get my 
money's worth. I've always thought anything Doze can do, GNU/Linux does 
better!
