I haven't seen a kernel version that you are working with,
but hopefully that won't matter.  This is from 2.4.19:
./ipc/sem.c:96:int sem_ctls[4] = {SEMMSL, SEMMNS, SEMOPM, SEMMNI};
./ipc/sem.c:97:#define sc_semmsl        (sem_ctls[0])
./ipc/sem.c:98:#define sc_semmns        (sem_ctls[1])
./ipc/sem.c:99:#define sc_semopm        (sem_ctls[2])
./ipc/sem.c:100:#define sc_semmni       (sem_ctls[3])
so that's the order.  If Alan replies, his matching reply can confirm
this.  :)
