Subject: The ondemand CPUFreq code -- I hope the functionality stays

Hello,
It sounds, from comments in the discussion of CPU Hotplug locking
problems, as though you are considering deleting the ondemand CPUFreq
code.  If this happens, I hope that something that provides the same
functionality replaces it.  I really appreciate having my power
consumption automatically modulated on an as needed basis.  Power
management seems to be one of the areas where there is a lot of room
for improvement.
Thanks,
      Miles
