I just see the patch adding a net of one #ifdef (and 3 lines of .c
file), and I don't consider that a cleanup. :(
If you make the function static, and make sure to cover that Dprintk up
with the #ifdef, I think the compiler should take care of the rest and
just throw away the function.  Then, you won't need to add the second
#ifdef.  You can even kill the brackets in that for loop.
Also, if you're going to be mucking around in there, can you give
setup_node_zones() a better name?  It doesn't exactly setup any zones
any more.  alloc_node_mem_map(), perhaps?  The comment above it is
bogus, too.
