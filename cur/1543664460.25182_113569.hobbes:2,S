   cmd probably could be u32 (since it is ioctl32 after all), but I doubt
   it matters, as two following entries are pointers so it looks to me
   like it is going to be lost by alignment, anyway.
These pointers can (and WERE!) 32-bit on sparc64, so we wouldn't
have the alignment problem there.
All kernel text on sparc64 (even in modules) occur in the lower
32-bits of the address apce.
