In 2.4 there is a race when find_actor is used in conjunction with
->read_inode2, because inode_lock is released before calling
->read_inode2 and hence, find_actor cannot safely rely on
initialisations of inode's private part done in ->read_inode2. This is
why in 2.5 iget5_locked takes special "set" callback that is called from
under inode_lock. It so happened that reiserfs is the only (is it?) file
system that used both find_actor and ->read_inode2, but whole API is
just broken and should be fixed.
