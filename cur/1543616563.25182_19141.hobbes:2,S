Hallo kernel hackers,
is it possible to include an emulation for the CMOV* (and possible other
i686 instructions) for processors that dont have these (k6, pentium
etc.)? I think this should work like the fpu emulation. Even if its slow
it will allow you to work even if you tried to install a libc for i686
on an older architecture or if you have apps that are statically linked
against such a libc (rpm, e2fschk, etc.).
I found some info on this here:
        
http://gwenole.beauchesne.online.fr/basilisk2/
        "... * uae_jit: added CMOV "emulation" for processors that don't
         support them ..."
Maybe this can be of any use to hack it in the kernel?
thanx,
ron
