For 2.5 there is Stuart MacDonald's TIOCRS485GET/SET patch that I gather 
he'll be sending later.
This uses a per-card control function which would be needed anyway,
the problem is support for additional magic outside the UART.
This patch could be extended to _define_ all the various options and leave
it up to user space what is chosen, if the card doesn't support that
option it can the return -EINVAL or some such.
It wouldn't be much bloat to add #defines for the other options, the way 
he has done it, except in the card support stage, and that only affect
card which support the option.

Well, its 485/422 anyway , but ISTR there a a number of industrial
buses based around these but they are all different, all standards still,
some have official (for some values of) blessing in their industrial sector.

     Think of the mess on the carpet. Sensible people do all their
     demon-summoning in the garage, which you can just hose down afterwards.
