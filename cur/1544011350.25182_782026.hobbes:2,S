  Hi folks,
Guess I have your attention now thanks to LWN ;)
Next round of the preadv & pwritev patch series, hopefully finally
solving the architecture issues.  I've decided to go with the suggestion
from the s390 guys:  split the 64bit offset into two explicitly coded
32bit halves.  The syscall prototype should work now for all archs
without (in-kernel) wrappers.  glibc must wrap the syscalls though to
hide that split from the applications.  But there is no way around glibc
wrappers anyway, so I think that is sensible decision.
cheers,
  Gerd
