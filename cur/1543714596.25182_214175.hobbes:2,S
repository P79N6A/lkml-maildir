So, I understand that the 2.6 SMP balancer redistributes workload on a 
periodic basis.  Once every second or something, it migrates processes.
A NUMA system would have to do something similar, where if there is a 
page which is referenced by only one process, and the page is located on 
the "wrong" node, it could be migrated.  This could be done gradually by 
a periodic background process.  Is this already how it works?
Also, if a page is being referenced by multiple nodes, the same 
background process could make mirror copies.  (Age of page would be an 
important consideration here so moves don't happen for short-lived pages.)
