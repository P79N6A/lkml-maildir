nitpicking, i'm sure, but:
5.10.01 could have several meanings, usually depending
on geographic location etc., and there is an ISO
standard (8601) which says:
  The international standard date notation is 
  YYYY-MM-DD
I'd prefer not to be confused by the '>' quoted notation
above, although I don't mind the dots instead of hyphens.
