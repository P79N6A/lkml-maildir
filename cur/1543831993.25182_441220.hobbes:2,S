Yes, and that is correct.  They should never be marked __initdata, as
that is wrong for when CONFIG_HOTPLUG is enabled and the module is built
in.
So either use __devinitdata, or nothing (as it's only a memory savings
if CONFIG_HOTPLUG is not enabled, which is real tough these days, and
the driver is built into the system.)
