Thanks hch for pointing this out.
We definitely should get together to hammer our one implementation.
Having different scripts for every distributions is a PITA.
I'm not saying my implementation is the greatest on earth, so
if anyone has any better suggestions I'm all ears.
If anyone is interested I can give a short overview of it.
As per normal, proper documentation is about to be written RSN.
Cheers,
Hannes
