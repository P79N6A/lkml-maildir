Hi Linus, Andrew,
as promised here comes a set of 6 patches against -rc3-bk3 that brings 
the DVB subsystem in sync with the LinuxTV.org CVS repository.
The most important stuff is inside 4/6 and 5/6. The frontend code has 
been simplified and support for some cards has been fixed.
There is a new firmware for the dvb-ttpci driver out there, which 
improves stability with digital videorecorder applications. The BC2C 
driver has been split up, because there are now USB based devices out 
there. The dib-usb driver now supports more devixces with other 
frontends out there, so the patch is fairly large.
Detailed descriptions are at the top of each patch.
Please apply before 2.6.10. Thanks!
Regards
Michael Hunold.
