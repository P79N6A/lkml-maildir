Exported for historical reasons (and no longer necessary):

Not really used:

I removed all exports above from the ALSA CVS.
The following headers are the driver API, so the unused symbols might
be used by future drivers:

However, I think some of these functions should not be part of the
API; I'll remove them, too.
The functions in the snd-trident-synth module might be used when^Wif
MIDI support for it will be written.
