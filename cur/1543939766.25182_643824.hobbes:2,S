During the test, run top, and watch your CPU usage. Does it go above 80% 
(the default for 
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/ondemand/up_threshold).
ondemand CPUfreq governor has a few tunables, described in 
Documentation/cpu-freq. One of them is up_threshold:
up_threshold: defines what the average CPU usaged between the samplings
of 'sampling_rate' needs to be for the kernel to make a decision on
whether it should increase the frequency. For example when it is set
to its default value of '80' it means that between the checking
intervals the CPU needs to be on average more than 80% in use to then
decide that the CPU frequency needs to be increased.
What CPUFreq processor driver are you using?
I had a similar problem with CPUfreq and dm-crypt (slow reads), see 
(more setup problem than something kernel-related):
