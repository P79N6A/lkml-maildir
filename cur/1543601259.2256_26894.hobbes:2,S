/* bh state bits */
#define BH_Uptodate     0       /* 1 if the buffer contains valid data */
#define BH_Dirty        1       /* 1 if the buffer is dirty */
#define BH_Lock         2       /* 1 if the buffer is locked */

#define BH_JWrite       9       /* 1 if being written to log (@@@ DEBUGGING)*/
#define BH_QuickFree    10      /* 1 if alloced and freed quickly (see below)*/
#define BH_Alloced      11      /* 1 if buffer has been allocated */
#define BH_Freed        12      /* 1 if buffer has been freed (truncated)*/
#define BH_Revoked      13      /* 1 if buffer has been revoked from the log*/
#define BH_RevokeValid  14      /* 1 if buffer revoked flag is valid */
#define BH_JDirty       15      /* 1 if buffer is dirty but journaled */
As you can see, that is already taken from ext3.  Is this ok?
#define BH_LowPrio      16      /* 1 if the buffer is temporary (unlinked)
Or do I only have 16 bits to work with?
TIA,
Mike
