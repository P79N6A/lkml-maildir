I applied the i2c-core part:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=6ea23039cb1cc7c379eb5fba0ed2c53291e9bea7
But I have no idea what happened to the DVB device-driver specific part.

http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=cea443a81c9c6257bf2d00f1392f7d1d4ce03b75
