Hi!
I'm trying to compile VMWare Express 2.0.4 (latest build) modules so I can 
run Windows on my redhat 7.1 box, but I got the following errors:

Unable to build the vmmon module.
For more information on how to troubleshoot module-related problems, please 
have
a look at "
http://www.vmware.com/download/modules/modules.html".
Execution aborted.
I'm sure it's not a GCC problem. Does anyone have a patch to fix this, or any 
tip? I tried to run the binary module, but it prints out a lot of unresolved 
symbols.
Any help will be apreciated.
Regards,
Thiago
