Wow!  I have been running 80wire cable detection override on 40wire cables 
for quite some time without any problem, but I never thought it to be legal 
if the 40wire cable length is short enough.
How short does it have to be, and can't we have a kernel bootparm to override 
the cable detection?
Thanks!
