I do know how to use loop devices. ;-)
Now you mention it, "losetup" without encryption works fine.
This: losetup -e blowfish /dev/loop0 /tmp/test.img
fails with "bad address" if the blowfish module is not loaded,
and causes a kernel panic if it is (and now I have to go home
to reset my machine. :-( ).
The only thing I can see that the ppdd patch has done here is to
increase LO_KEY_SIZE from 32 to 1844; the rest should be as in
vanilla 2.6.13 (though at some point I'll recompile without
patches and see if that changes anything).
