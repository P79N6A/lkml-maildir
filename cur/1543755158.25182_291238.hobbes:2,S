You can already write this as
last-$(CONFIG_SND) := last.o
obj-y += $(last-y)
I'm not sure if this is better than the current version, but I'd
prefer it to using the extra function.

I don't fully understand what all those examples should do, so they
are probably not that intuitive. I'm pretty sure that we can already
express them all with either ifeq() or two assignments, though.
Both are already used in the kernel (see ipc/Makefile for an
example of yx2x), so maybe the preferred style should be documented
in CodingStyle.
