Performance considerations make compiling for 386 a relatively poor
solution. I'm very much in favor of the runtime checks and will
intensively investigate that method of dealing with the situation, and
with any luck follow up soon with a solution acceptable to both you and
others for this dynamic TSC usage issue.
