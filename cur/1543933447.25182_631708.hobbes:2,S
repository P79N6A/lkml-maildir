Actually bond2 isn't in the recvmsg, it's just that strace is
printing out the complete content of the buffer which happenes
to include bond2.
I've verified that the first recvmsg indeed does not contain the
bond2 address at all.  Instead of the first 3 IPv4 records it has
3 IPv6 records.  So we seem to have a kernel problem here.
However, too many changes have been made in this area since 2.6.14
for it to be worthwhile for me to debug this any further until you
manage to reproduce it with the current kernel.
Cheers,
