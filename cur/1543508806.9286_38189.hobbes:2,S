You may feel this a little off-topic for lkml, but I can't find any
similar problem in any search engine.
I'm trying to load parport_pc on a machine which prints fine
under win9x. win reports dma 3, irq 7, io 3bc-3be & 7bc-7be for
the parallel port settings. On a 2.2.5 kernel, insmod parport
followed by insmod parport_pc io=0x3bc, or 7bc or 278 or 378,
with or without irq(=7/none) and dma fails with init_module:
Device or resource busy. Loading 2.2.12, it seems I can override
the failure to detect the port and instead get the following
messages:
0x3bc: CTR: wrote 0x0c, read 0xff
0x3bc: DATA: wrote 0xaa, read 0xff
parport0: PC-style at 0x3bc [SPP,PS2]
Ok, so it isn't seeing it. Where is it? Why can't it see it?
Any attempt to write to the port fails to produce any output
at any port setting and does not increment irq 7 in
/proc/interrupts if I specify that irq. Of course, this is
after insmod lp.
Thanks for any insight.
Paul
