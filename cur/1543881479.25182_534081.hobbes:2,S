As a data point here, and probably nothing to do with X, but I did manage to 
lock it up, solid, reset button time tonight, by wanting 'smart' to get done 
with an update session after amanda had started.  I took both smart processes 
I could see in htop all the way to -19, but when it was about done about 3 
minutes later, everything came to an instant, frozen, reset button required 
lockup.  I should have stopped at -17 I guess. :(
