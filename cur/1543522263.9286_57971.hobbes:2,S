%ebx is used to hold a pointer to the GOT for PIC, and syscalls are trying
to use ot for the  second argument.

You can't do anything to %ebx, it is reserved and out of limits.

If you are using separate asm()s, they are considered separately by the
compiler. Without volatile it might just move them around, and it might try
to place instructions in betweeen regardless. You have to write each one as
a single strech in one asm().

They need two anyway, % is used in asm() just like in printf(3) to
introduce special formatting (%0 is replaced by whatever text the first arg
gives, etc). So to get '%' you have to write '%%'. You'll have to juggle
them into the right registers yourself.
BTW, how is this important? glibc is doing it right, I'd say leave it along
(and perhaps point people who want to build their own shlib using raw
syscalls to glibc for ideas)
