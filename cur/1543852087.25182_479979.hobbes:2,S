Hi Fernando,
As I also mentioned in my reply to Peter Chubb, this is the wrong fix
for this problem as the driver should operate in cached and uncached
mode on non SN2 systems.
Here is the correct fix. I have test it on SN2 and made sure it builds
for DIG, but I can't easily test it. However I see no reason why it
should cause problems.
This is ending up as an attachment since it ended up in the IMAP only
mailbox. Somehow I am willing to bet Thunderbug will do something stupid
to it, like base64 encode it.
Cheers,
Jes
PS: When you post fixes for an IA64 specific driver like this, please
    always remember to CC the ia64 list and the ia64 maintainer on it!
Fix MSPEC driver to build for non SN2 enabled configs as the driver
should work in cached and uncached modes (no fetchop) on these systems.
In addition make MSPEC select IA64_UNCACHED_ALLOCATOR, which is required
for it.
