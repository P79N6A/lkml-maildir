So the 'correct' alias for this device should be eg.:
usb:v0545p800Dd030Adc*dsc*dp*ic*isc*ip*
right?
Given this new info... what if _lo is 0x030a and _hi is 0x030f? How would the
alias look like? Or worse, what if _lo is 0x030a and _hi is 0x040a?
Would these be correct?
usb:v0545p800Dd030[A-F]dc*dsc*dp*ic*isc*ip*
usb:v0545p800Dd0[30A-40A]dc*dsc*dp*ic*isc*ip*
Thanks in advance.
