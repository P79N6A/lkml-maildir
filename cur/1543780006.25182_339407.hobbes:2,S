The function is basically set in stone.  Variants exists depending on
how it is called.  I know of four variants, but there may be more:
1. Initial value is 0
2. Initial value is 0xffffffff
a) Result is taken as-is
b) Result is XORed with 0xffffffff
Maybe your code implements 1a, while you tried 2b with the lib/crc32.c
function or something similar?
