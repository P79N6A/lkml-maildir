Care to read, what I wrote futher down ?

I know.

So you know where it is and you can confirm that it works fine ?
Pointers please.

Yes, I did. And it adds it for a fscking good reason. 
1) two times in common.c due to the existing detection logic mess
2) once in the 64 bit version
Again, this code is inherited and fragile mess, which can not be
changed at will.

That's not a real good reason to yell at him.
Yinghai  wanted to help out and check with the reporter whether this CPU
works with PAT or not.
Yinghai made a mistake.
You come along and ride a crusade against him for that. Very helpful.
