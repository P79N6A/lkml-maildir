Strongly depends on how this is done. Of course, replacing
user@domain.org by user(at)domain.org or even user AT domain DOT org
won't help. However, I wonder what amount of spambots will spot user:
domain org as a valid e-mail address.
There are also HTML+CSS tricks that should work well. Split the address
over right-floating span elements, these will display in the reverse
order. I doubt that the spambots will get it right.
I don't think that the cut'n'paste ability argument weights much here.
How often do you do that?
Thanks.
