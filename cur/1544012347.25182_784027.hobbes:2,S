Most important thing first. Santa is from Greenland and
all roumors about him being Finnish / living in Rovaniemi
is pure marketing.
The US people somtimes do the mistake of naming Greenland
the north pole in this context - they know better now.
Secondly...
How does the merge window plan look for 2.6.29?
I know that everyone should have everything prepared by now but
reality is sometimes a little bit different...
Extending the merge period with anohter week to partly cover up
for the holiday without hitting the start of LCA sounds like
a good plan to me.
