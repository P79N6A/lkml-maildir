One Mr Pavlik solved the same issue on bugzilla:
    ------- Additional Comment #1 From Vojtech Pavlik 2004-01-14 09:35 ------- 
    Use protocol "ExplorerPS/2" in XFree86. This may not seem logical, but
    because 2.6 handles the Logitech mouse protocol itself and presents a more
    common Microsoft-like protocol to applications that don't know how to use
    its native event protocol.
I wonder how the IM and Explorer protocols relate.
