The test on ext3 on 2.4.24-pre2 failed. The read-only directory has been 
gone.
As from the number of files and blocks that 'df' says, not only the lost 
directory
has been gone, it looks the directories and files under it also have 
been gone.
The remove command looks like it really worked on the directory, rather than
the parent directory is broken.
The test on ext2 is still running.
Thanks,
Yoshi
