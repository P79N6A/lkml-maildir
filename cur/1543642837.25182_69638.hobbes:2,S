This seems to be a serious limitation. There are good reasons for wanting to
use different HBAs for the different paths.
And the Scsi_Device might be quite different. Imagine something like two
storage boxes which do internal replication among them; yes, you'd only want
to use one of them normal (because the Cache-coherency traffic is going to
kill performance otherwise), but you can failover from one to the other even
if they have different SCSI serials etc.

That is a good point.
But it would also be true for a generic block device implementation.

SATA will also support multipathing if the birds were right, so it might make
sense to keep this in mind, at least for 2.7.

Well, there is code available for all the others too ;-)

The volume manager multi-pathing, at least as done via the LVM1 patch, has a
major drawback. It can't easily be stacked with software RAID. It is very
awkward to do that right now.
And software RAID on top of multi-pathing is a typical example for a truely
fault tolerant configuration.
Thats obviously easier with md, and I assume your SCSI code can also do that
nicely.

Yes. Error handling in particular ;-)
The topology information you mention is also a good candidate for exposure.

Having the block device handling all block devices seems fairly reasonable to
me.

Well, I guess 2.5/2.6 will have all the different multi-path implementations
mentioned so far (EVMS, LVM2, md, scsi, proprietary) - they all have code and
a userbase... All of them and future implementations can benefit from better
error handling and general cleanup, so that might be the best to do for now.
I think it is too soon to clean that up and consolidate the m-p approaches,
but I think it really ought to be consolidated in 2.7, and this seems like a
good time to start planning for that one.
Sincerely,
