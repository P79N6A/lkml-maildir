The question whether linux/ or asm/ is the best place for the definition 
boils down to the question whether it is expected that default_idle() is 
present on all architectures or whether it's an architecture-specific 
implementation detail.
In the first case, I'm surprised that there is no platform independent 
code using it.
In the second case, it seems we can kill the default_idle() functions on 
mips (empty) and parisk.

I stumbled across the question whether include/linux/platform.h is still 
required by cleaning up warnings with the -Wmissing-prototypes compiler 
flag I plan to add to the kernel CFLAGS soon that generates warnings 
for such extern constructs...
