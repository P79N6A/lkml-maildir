How useful is glxgears as benchmark here? The X.org people has been saying
for ages that "glxgears is not a benchmark". Some people (at least on ubuntu)
even patched it so that if you want to get FPS numbers, you need to pass the
"-iacknowledgethatthistoolisnotabenchmark" option. There's a good page
explaining why at 
http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Glxgears_is_not_a_Benchmark
I realize that it may be OK for scheduler testing, but maybe it'd be more
interesting to test other kind of 3d benchmark tools.
