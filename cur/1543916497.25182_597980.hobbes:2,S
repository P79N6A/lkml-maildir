I have a similar panel in the sense that it needs a bunch of SPI
commands to get started. I implemented a LCD driver
(drivers/video/backlight) for it so that it is automatically turned
on/off at bootup/shutdown, and can be manually turned on/off
through /sys/class/lcd/ltv350qv/power. AFAIK the driver is currently
sitting in the backlight tree scheduled for inclusion in 2.6.24.

Just implement it as a regular I2C chip driver which registers a device
with the LCD framework when it is successfully probed.
