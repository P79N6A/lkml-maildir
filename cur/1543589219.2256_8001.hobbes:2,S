    Ug.  I like to view swap as "low grade memory" -- i.e. I really
should spend 99.9% of my time in RAM -- if I spill, then it means
I'm running too much/too big for my computer and should get more RAM --
meanwhile, I suffer with performance degradation to remind me I'm really
exceeding my machine's physical memory capacity.
    An interesting option (though with less-than-stellar performance
characteristics) would be a dynamically expanding swapfile.  If you're
going to be hit with swap penalties, it may be useful to not have to
pre-reserve something you only hit once in a great while.
    Definitely only for systems where you don't expect to use swap (but
it could be there for "emergencies" up to some predefined limit or
available disk space).
