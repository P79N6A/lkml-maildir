I don't think I'd qualify the people on this list as 'idiots'.  And people don't all send RTFM
replies.  If you felt like that was gonna be the kind of reply you'd get, why did you post on the
list anyways???
And, yes, I'd send it from my real address, if I were the one with the problem!
Besides, having someone to talk to would be much easier than to post on the list for all replies.
