WRONG!
Some of us USE the PSN for good and not evil.  I hacked ssh to append
the PSN of all cpus in my system in ascending order to my passphrase.
That's an extra 24 bytes of passphrase that I don't have to type but
still keeps me feeling that much more secure.  If my passphrase is
somehow compromised, I'm ok unless someone has physical access to my
machine.   With physical access of course, all bets are off.
