OK, I see it.  I'm not an emacs user and I have no idea how correct
the patch is.
There is another emacs CodingStyle patch from Dan Carpenter that
expands the "~" part of the filename to the user directory:
see

so I would be tempted to merge/apply both patches.
Any other comments on these patches?
