This utility seems to be a good one, but it's basically the same as 
disktest, although much more advanced.

Yes, it might be worth to try. Since fundamentally it's the same as 
O_DIRECT dd, but with a bit less overhead on the initiator side (hence 
less initiator side latency), most likely it will show ever bigger 
difference, than it is with dd.
