I see.  Then there must be something else to explain
the behavior I'm observing with slapd.
Each and every call to sched_yield() makes the process
sleep for over *50ms* while a "nice make bootstrap" is
running in the background:
[pid  8780]      0.000033 stat64("gidNumber.dbb", 0xb7b3ebcc) = -1 EACCES (Permission denied)
[pid  8780]      0.000059 pread(20, "\0\0\0\0\1\0\0\0\1\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\2\0\344\17\2\3"..., 4096, 4096) = 4096
[pid  8780]      0.000083 pread(20, "\0\0\0\0\1\0\0\0\4\0\0\0\3\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\222\0<\7\1\5\370"..., 4096, 16384) = 4096
[pid  8780]      0.000078 time(NULL)    = 1124322520
[pid  8780]      0.000066 pread(11, "\0\0\0\0\1\0\0\0\250\0\0\0\231\0\0\0\235\0\0\0\16\0000"..., 4096, 688128) = 4096
[pid  8780]      0.000241 write(19, "0e\2\1\3d`\4$cn=bernie,ou=group,dc=d"..., 103) = 103
[pid  8780]      0.000137 sched_yield( <unfinished ...>
      ...zzzz...
[pid  8781]      0.050020 <... sched_yield resumed> ) = 0
[pid  8780]      0.000025 <... sched_yield resumed> ) = 0
[pid  8781]      0.000060 futex(0x925ab20, FUTEX_WAIT, 33, NULL <unfinished ...>
[pid  8780]      0.000026 write(19, "0\f\2\1\3e\7\n\1\0\4\0\4\0", 14) = 14
[pid  8774]      0.000774 <... select resumed> ) = 1 (in [19])
Actually, I'm now noticing that several slapd threads were
involved here.  Depending how strace handles relative
timestamps of multiple processes, it may mean both 8780 and
8781 slept too much or just 8781 did and 8780 was quick.
Any idea?  I'm planning to patch my kernel to print the
time_slice value in /proc/*/stat.  This way I can check
it's being computed as intended for both slapd and gcc.
