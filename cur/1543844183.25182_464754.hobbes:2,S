It turns out that static variables like that get included in the
ordinary symbol tables along with other (un)initialized globals - it
has been making it into /proc/kallsyms.  If the normal symbol table is
not available, then some other measure would be needed to find the
variable containing the function pointer.

While varargs simplify some things, it sacrifices type-safety, in that
a handler function would have to be varargs too.  For the systemtap
marker prototype, parametrized variants use scores of (automatically
generated) macros, with different arity/type permutations, each
self-describing and type-safe.
Regarding a marker variant that would require kprobes (inserting a
labelled NOP or few), it may be an appropriate choice where dormant
marker overhead must be minimal and robust parameter passing is less
important.
