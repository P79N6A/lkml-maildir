I have a Duron 800 socket A on an Epox 8KTA3.
Has anyone noticed fluctuations with these tests.. such as
jrm_athlon1:
...
copy_page function 'faster_copy'         took 9869 cycles per page
copy_page function 'even_faster'         took 9822 cycles per page
...
jrm_athlon2:
...
copy_page function 'faster_copy'         took 9939 cycles per page
copy_page function 'even_faster'         took 17728 cycles per page
...
jrm_athlon3:
...
copy_page function 'faster_copy'         took 17711 cycles per page
copy_page function 'even_faster'         took 9843 cycles per page
...
I see these with gcc 2.95.4(Debian unstable) and a local build of
gcc-3.0 from CVS last night.
Almost as though some stall and/or caching is corrupting the results.
