I think this is wrong (as is Junio's). I think we should still honor the 
repository permission setting, and default to honoring umask.
So I think that if the user has a umask that says "nobody else can read", 
then we should *not* make it world readable (unless the 
"shared_repository" thing is set to override it, of course).
