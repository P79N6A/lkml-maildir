Agreed. In long term, I think cpuidle will also have one governor that will be
used in most of the cases. But, we have to go through the process of
experimenting with different governors, just like cpufreq and let the best
governor win. I think this interface helps to experiment with new
governors in a non-disruptive way. I mean, any new experiments will not have
side effects on people already using currently established drivers in
distributions.
Also, one of the things we are looking at is to have ratings for different
drivers and governors (similar to time subsystem), with which we can control
best driver and best governor for a platform from inside the kernel, instead
of depending on admin/init script to do the right thing.
Having said that, I do feel we may need a different governor for things like
handhelds. I heard them saying there idle routines has more than one
dimension of low power-high latency idle states. But, that do not suggest the
need for runtime switch in sysfs, as it will still be one proper governor for
a platform.

oops. I don't think we need to export here.
Though, name should change to current_cpuidle_driver as it is non-static. Will
fix it in next rev.
