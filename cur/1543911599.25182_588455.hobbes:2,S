I agree, I looked at the includes and had the same thoughts.  I sent
it in because there is a problem here, and it fixes a UML config
without noticably breaking anything else.

Yes, it's straightforward - 
tlb.h:
static inline void
tlb_flush_mmu(struct mmu_gather *tlb, unsigned long start, unsigned long end)
{
	...
		free_pages_and_swap_cache(tlb->pages, tlb->nr);
	...
}
swap.h:
#define free_pages_and_swap_cache(pages, nr) \
	release_pages((pages), (nr), 0);
Feel free to drop it, and I'll look at this some more.
