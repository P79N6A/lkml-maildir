No. It is fully-VIA motherboard (Asus A7V), VIA KT133 as a northbridge 
and VIA686A as a southbridge, with 1GHz Athlon. And spurious IRQ happen 
when either of (massive) IRQ sources (Promise UDMA, tulip-based network 
card, an es137x soundcard) emits interrupts.
Problem is best visible when Promise is used in PIO mode with block size=512,
as in such case you can get thousands of IRQs from Promise in second, and
tenths of spurious IRQ7. But even if Promise emits in average one IRQ each 
second (== idle system with running cron and atime updates on), I get 
~10 of spurious IRQ7 during one hour.
I can get complete lspci -vvv at home, if you want.
