Just look at the code. It does FIFO for any request that _isn't_
specified as ELEVATOR_INSERT_FRONT - which means any fs request, or any
plain pc request. There is no specific reordering going on.
Drivers expect to be able to add a request back at the head, for eg
retrying it after a QUEUE_BUSY or similar condition.
