eg. i sent 8 different scheduler update patches 5 days ago:
 [patch] [sched] fork-fix 2.5.3-pre5
 [patch] [sched] yield-fixes 2.5.3-pre5
 [patch] [sched] SCHED_RR fix, 2.5.3-pre5
 [patch] [sched] set_cpus_allowed() fix, 2.5.3-pre5
 [patch] [sched] entry.S offset fix, 2.5.3-pre5.
 [patch] [sched] cpu_logical_map fixes, balancing, 2.5.3-pre5
 [patch] [sched] compiler warning fix, 2.5.3-pre3
 [patch] [sched] unlock_task_rq() cleanup, 2.5.3-pre3
these patches, while many of them are touching the same file (sched.c) are
functionally orthogonal, and can be applied in any order. Linus has
applied all of them, but he might have omitted any questionable one and
still apply the rest.
how would such changes be expressed via BK, and would it be possible for
Linus to reject/accept an arbitrary set of these patches?
