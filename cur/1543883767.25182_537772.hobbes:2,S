Hi Andrew,
But, even if this is the case, it should be transparent WHAT DIFFERENT HARDWARE
IS MEANT EXACTLY! DST AND DST_CA CANNOT BE MEANT - this I have made quite shure!
I swear I did not notice any errors - so as long as I cannot see through where the problem is, and as long as I have been working with my patches without the slightest noise for months now - where should I apply some additions then?
See, there's a third mechanism for symbol resolution which is used at
runtime, not at build time: symbol_request().
If this symbol_request() appears at runtime, then there should be some feedback in dmesg or any other kind of syslog.
But I swear I haven't seen any kind of bad or counterproductive messages like this!
My system runs excelent with my patches - so why should I care?
I meanwhile have sent my patches to someone, he will have a look at them - and we all will see what happens then.
Above that I will at least try to enhance those two patches by a dvb-pll.c deselection feature which I said very politely to Trent that I am missing it.
And I want to get out now of that horrible discussion - I am exhausted.
Cheers
Uwe
