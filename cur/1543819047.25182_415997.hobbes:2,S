Hello,
The problem is that boot loader developers did not 
understand the old statement: "A string that is too long 
will be automatically truncated by the kernel, a boot loader 
may allow a longer command line to be passed to permit 
future kernels to extend this limit."
Most of them handed the same buffer to < 2.02 protocols and 
 >= 2.0.2 protocols. When I've opened bugs against that they 
claimed that they follow instructions since the 256 limit 
was explicitly mentioned. I've ended up in patching GRUB 
my-self to allow this.
I thought that this should be made clearer... But maybe I 
did not write it too well.
I've removed the 255+1 limitation from the boot protocol 
main description, so there will be no known limit there... 
And moved it to the <2.02 section notes.
Can you please suggest a different phrasing? Or maybe you 
think that it is not needed at all... But then I have a 
problem of making boot loader fix their code.
Best Regards,
Alon Bar-Lev.
