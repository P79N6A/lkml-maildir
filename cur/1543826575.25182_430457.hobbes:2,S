Subject: [PATCH 3/3] sd: early detection of medium not present
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/6/6/148

This patch (as696) moves the check for medium not present a bit earlier in 
the sd_spinup_disk() routine.  The existing code will happily continue 
probing even after the device has told it there is no media.
