Agreed. But an expected behaviour :-).

To be true, we have here the situation that several persons (no root-privileges)
have to manage together a commen directory-tree. It was hard and for some
actions impossible to write tools which manipulate this tree in a secure way.
Secure in the sense: root does not trust these people nor trust they each
other. So this seems to be a little bit paranoid, the reason for this is
that the number of these peoples is rather high, changes rather often and
they are no unix-experts at all which means that we have to take into account
there accounts may be misused by other people.
In the moment there seems to be only one really secure working solution - this
is using a server-process (there are others, but these are rather inefficient
and complicated).
This is the reason I'm relativly sensitiv to these problems.
The default-file-mechanism makes it again harder. Because it is more difficult
to write tools which change the ownership of files and directories.
But I completely agree that the default-mechanism may be very useful in a lot
of situations.
And I have the strong feeling that the whole fchmod(), fchown(), ... is not
correct solution for the problem "a name changes its object". In a lot of (most)
common and important situations these functions can not be used to ensure
a name does not change its object (especially you can't ensure that a name
is still not used for an object if you want to create one).
Example:
- creation of names in a non-trusted directory - a directory can not
be trusted if any of its parents can be manipulated by other processes (but
root). /tmp is only the obvious example. But more subtile is if I share
a directory with another person.
- web-servers for example: if a web-server allow users to export their own
directories it is rather hard to ensure they will not export /etc/passwd or
other config-files using symlinks.
- nfs-server
- samba
Short: always if you want to check a path component for component that you
are not fooled by a symlink.
Short: I see that the default-mechanism does make it harder but not really.
And again: I wished we would have a general mechanism for a process to tell
the kernel: for these names: do not accept any filesystem-operation if the
resolution of the names have changed (that means it identifies another object
or id identifies one when it was unused).
If I want to check /a/b/c/d (maybe that is does not point back to /etc/passwd)
you may do
	name_lock("/a","/a/b","/a/b/c","/a/b/c/d");
	e = lstat("/a");
	if (e != 0 && errno == ENEWRESOLUTION) {
		fprintf("Aja: someone changed entry /a: it now names another
			 object\n");
		return 1;
	}
	/* what you want zu check for /a */
	e = lstat("/a/b");
	if (e != 0 && errno == ENEWRESOLUTION) {
		fprintf("Aja: someone changed entry /a/b: it now names another
			 object\n");
		return 1;
	}
	...
	name_unlock("/a", "/a/b", "/a/b/c");
Or a nfs-daemon could - instead of keeping a file with path p open - just use
name_lock the name p for it. If it opens p it again this fails with
ENEWRESOLUTION if someone other removed this file or renamed another file so it
now has the name p.
You can use it to detect if a mountpoint changed.
You can rename files in untrusted directories, because you can check all
path-components, source and target-name and then do the rename.
It is a rather general approach and should also eliminate almost all reasons
why one want to have sometimes an open by inode (which is a bad idea, I think).
It allows a process to protect itself against races when changing the namespace
or accesing objects by name, but does not break unix semantics how a filesystem
behaves.
These name_lock/unlock would be a sort of weak partial namespace snapshot.
It does not inhibit that this namespace may be manipulated but it allows you
to protect your own manipulation and interpretation of the namespace your
interested in: you can say: do it only if its still what it was when I called
name_lock() for it. It is of course no transaction (there is no rollback), but
a little bit similar to a optimistic lock.
Don't know if it is difficult to implement in the linux-kernel.
The more we go the way to say: the name should be used as identifier of an
object and the namespace is involved if it can be accessed at all (permissions
of directories), we need some control of the namespace.
Excuse that I left the subject and talked about something relativly unrelated.
