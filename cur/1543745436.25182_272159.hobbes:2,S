Looks like there's only way -- or: two ways and one choice:
- Either leave it all as it is ATM (kind of unsatisfying) or
- (unintentionally) break all apps now, or announce that they could brake if they
relied on special features (as outlined above), and at the same time implement
proper directory traversal.
