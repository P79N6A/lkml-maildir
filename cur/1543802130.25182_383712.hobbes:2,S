Hi guys,
I´m starting a social project to teach kernel development for young
students, with objetive of include these people in job market.
These studentes don´t have great skills in mathematical and computer
science areas, but have great interest in development area. Some
studentes have a little basic C language skills.
Which are the first steps that I need in this project ?
Which´s the "more simple" kernel version to teach (2.2 ? 2.4 ? 2.6 ?).
I accept any suggestions.
Best Regards !
