No, both of those are actually ok, I'm not religious about big things like
this if I just feel that they have a good reason for them (and ALSA has a
good reason for being big).
My main reason for being silent on it has been that I've been doing other
things. I'll be merging ALSA in the not too distant future, but it's not
been a high priority for me like some of the other stuff I have spent my
time on..
