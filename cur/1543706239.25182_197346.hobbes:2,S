So what's the fix?
I'm trying to recompile util-linux-2.12 on Linux 2.6.2 and getting the same error as Alex.
I'm using linux-libc-headers-2.6.1.3 -- but they don't bother to say how to install them (and I assume they will work for Linux
2.6.2).
And all this is to try and get rid of the "mount version older than kernel" message.
I suppose there's a jolly good reason for splitting the headers but it seems to just present more opportunity to hork things up.
