Well, if it is in the chip, then what ever is in there doesn't work properly:
I have seen several different AMD Elan boards that failed to boot Linux. Adding
the "fast A20 enable" via port 0x92 to setup.S fixed the problem in all cases.

I hope you are not seriously suggesting that everyone who uses Linux
in embedded systems should be prepared to write their own BIOS.
Of course it's nice if you don't have to pay BIOS royalties, but in
my experience, people who have a high enough volume so that writing
their own BIOS would make sense tend to go for a different architecture
(PPC, ARM, MIPS, SH) in the first place.
(BTW, is your BIOS under GPL perchance ?)

Yep, my fault: The code _did_ work in a 2.2.x kernel, but I applied the
change to the latest 2.4 kernel, not realizing that the assembly syntax
had been changed in the meantime. I should have at least tested it. See below
for a corrected version. This time I've tested it: the unmodified kernel fails
to boot on a JUMPtec DIMM-PC (with AMD Elan SC410), the patched kernel
does boot.
Some may argue that simply writing 0x02 to port 0x92 would do the job and
they may well be right (it does work that way on the DIMM-PC). My suggested code
makes sure to keep bits #7-#2 unmodified and it always clears bit #0 (CPU
reset). Call me paranoid, but I think this is worth two extra assembly
instructions :-).
