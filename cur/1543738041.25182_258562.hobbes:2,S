I'll quote SuSv3 to illustrate the danger of "specifications"
"The system shall always zero-fill any partial page at the end of an
object. Further, the system shall never write out any modified portions
of the last page of an object which are beyond its end. References
within the address range starting at pa and continuing for len bytes to
whole pages following the end of an object shall result in delivery of a
SIGBUS signal."
Its a mistake, its not apparent if its actually meant something entirely
different or someone forgot a "not", or what is going on.
It certainly isnt a useful definition of mmap.

Portable applications don't work if you get that close to the grey areas
of a standard. Also you'll find the SuS spec simply doesn't work sanely
for some applications. Bind() is instant connect can block for example.
Now try implementing netbios - bind blocks, connect is instant, and the
posix spec is toiler paper grade at this point.
Likewise we have an MS-DOS FS. Its not POSIX behaviour. Should we remove
it, require a different set of system calls or decide that religious
application of standards is not useful.
Linux applies standards pragmatically. A setsockopt for strict socket
compliance might make sense. It'll trash the app performance for UDP but
it would allow users to select useful v posix.
