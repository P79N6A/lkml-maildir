Alan, 
Thanks for the response...

That's the thing, its nowhere near file-max, yet the number
of available file handles hits zero.  File-max was at 235928, 
~2000 file handles were alloacted, the available handles hit
zero but the number allocated didn't increase, if you see what
I mean.

2GB RAM, lots available
