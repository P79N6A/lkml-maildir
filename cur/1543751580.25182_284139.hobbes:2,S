Personally speaking, the key feature of the Halloween document was not
documenting what new features we had in the kernel -- it was the
ability to see what _user-visible_ changes there were. As a
"mainstream" user, I might not care much about a new O(1) scheduler,
but I might be affected by the removal of (say) ipchains.
Thanks,
Rahul
