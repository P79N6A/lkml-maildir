Subject: Why does C3 CPU downgrade in kernel 2.4.20?

Hi all,
  I rebuilt the 2.4.20 kernel with C3 CPU and found it been downgraded to
i486.
  And I check the file, linux/arch/i386/Makefile, in both of 2.4.19 and
2.4.20 kernels.
  In 2.4.19, the CFLAGS adds "-march=i586".
  But in 2.4.20, the CFLAGS adds
"-march=i486 -malign-functions=0 -malign-jumps=0 -malign-loops=0".
  Why do this? Could anybody explain this to me?
  BTW, if I substitute"i586" for "i486" and remove other parameters in that
file under 2.4.20, is there any affection during/after rebuilding kernel?
  Any help is appreciated.
Best Regards,
             Joseph
