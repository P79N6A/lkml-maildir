You can make it do what you want. From ioctl etc context (or basically
anyone calling ide_raw_taskfile() since that will block too), you can
use a blocking call to blk_get_request(). So
	rq = blk_get_request(q, WRITE, __GFP_WAIT);
will _never_ return NULL. You are basically throttling on the freelist
of the queue, just like any other submitter of I/O. And that, is a Good
Thing :-)
