Just getting linux up and running on this machine, so with the original
debian kernel (2.2.20 UP) and x86info from its unstable, these retail
XPs were identified as MPs
trillian:/home/spotter# uname -a
Linux trillian 2.2.20 #1 Sun Nov 4 15:44:23 EST 2001 i686 unknown
trillian:/home/spotter# x86info 
x86info v1.7.  Dave Jones 2001
Feedback to <davej@suse.de>.
Found 1 CPU, but found 2 CPUs in MPTable.
/dev/cpu/0/cpuid: No such device
Family: 6 Model: 6 Stepping: 2 [Athlon MP]
Processor name string: AMD Athlon(tm) MP Processor 1800+
PowerNOW! Technology information
Available features:
	Temperature sensing diode present.
prehaps 2.4.17 (compiling now) will make a difference, or does one need
your kernel + x86info to do it correctly?
thanks,
shaya
