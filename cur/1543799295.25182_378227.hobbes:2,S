But uint32_t is a correct POSIX type. Why would you smear its
use in the kernel when, in fact, one is not allowed to mix/match
kernel and user headers so it's impossible to pollute namespace?

instructed to dereference function pointers. If you don't like
this "obviously correct" syntax there is no reason to force your
will on others.
