4 memory spaces can be defined:
 - virtual memory: Memory space see from a software point of view
 - physical memory: Memory sp	ace see by the CPU before the MMU
translation take place. An aperture in this space
   is defined for host DRAM memory, PCI memory, and PCI IO (PowerPC CPU need
this).
   (This memory space is defined by the North Birdge manual.)
 - PCI memory bus: Memory space see by PCI boards.
 - PCI IO: IO space see by the PCI boards.
On an intel architecture the physical memory and the PCI bus memory use the
same address translation.
On a PREP PowerPC with a MPC106 North bridge all theses space are differents
and overlap each others.
My goal is to specify a model to write properly a PCI drivers and to remove
the junk on the actual drivers.
( Ex on matroxfb.c: if __power__pc use bus_to_virt() ..., if __i386__ use
ioremap() and so on)...
All the space conversion functions are properly defined:
bus_to_virt()
virt_to_bus()
...
Some members of struct pci_dev are not defined properly:
base_address[6]		(1) returns PCI bus memory on my PowerPC. (In my
opinion this is not a good idea.)
rom_address            	"
"
Some functions are not defined properly:
ioremap(void *,size)		(2) Seems to take a ptr on the PCI bus
memory (use base_address[] as argument)
(1), (2) A lot of drivers use ioremap() or bus_to_virt() to get the virtual
memory pointer of the PCI memory space device.
Using directly bus_to_virt() is not a good idea on some architecture the MMU
page is not defined, and linux crash.
Using ioremap() seems to be the good way, but a lot of drivers use the PCI
bus memory as an argument to
ioremap(). ioremap() seems to be a general function not limited to the
allocation of PCI memory...
I think the good way will be to defined base_address[6], rom_address (1) to
return the physical memory pointer.
And to give to ioremap() the physical memory pointer.
Some functions are defined to access PCI memory: readl ... Theses function
seems to be useless...
(See linux/Documentation/IO-mapping.txt)
Some drivers use directly the pci functions to get the PCI memory base
adddress this work on x86 but this is wrong...
And the last thing, to get all the PCI drivers working on all linux
architectures (I use a big-endian PowerPC but ...) is to have
all theses drivers Big Endian compliant...
Am I Wrong ?
