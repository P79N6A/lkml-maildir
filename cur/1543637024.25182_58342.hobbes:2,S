Subject: raid1 problems in 2.5.26 (maybe started at .1?)

I'm adding 2.5.26 to a stock redhat 7.3 distribution, which was
installed with a raid1 root
filesystem on /dev/hda1 and /dev/hdb1.
This is on a Dell GX-260 w/256MB RAM, twin 20MB IDE hard drives.
The system boots 2.5.26, runs, resyncs the raid1 array, and then, just
as the resync
finishes, the BUG at line 655 in drivers/md/raid1.c goes off:
    if (waitqueue_active(&conf->wait_resume)) BUG();
There are no other raid arrays on the system.
I _seriously_ hesitate to simply comment out the bugcheck :-)
It seems that the 2.5.1 patch made wholesale changes to the raid1
subsystem...
Anyone ever seen anything like this?  Have I missed something external
to the
kernel that needs to be updated between 2.4.18 and 2.5.26?
