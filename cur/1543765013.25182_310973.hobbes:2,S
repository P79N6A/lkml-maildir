"merge" does a better job than "diff3" since it can resolve the
conflicts caused by similar changes to a "parent" file (this is
available in both BK and GNU Arch). This is useful when you try to
merge 2 branches that both include a patch which is not under the
revision control. It also solves the conflicts caused by
cherry-picking changes (just need to find the last consecutive common
changeset as the common ancestor).
