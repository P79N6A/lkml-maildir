"if (!need_resched())" ]
I'm very surprised GCC doesn't warn about that.  A quick test confirms
GCC 3.2.2 at least doesn't.
So, this is a feature request:
    - Warn when a function name is tested in a boolean context.
      (A function pointer variable or expression should not be warned for).
      By boolean context I mean any place where a function name is
      used as a value and tested against zero.  Some examples:
          if (function_name)
          if (function_name && ( <some other expression> ))
          if (function_name != 0)
          if (function_name == 0)
          if (!function_name)
          x = function_name ? a : b;
    - Don't warn if there are two levels of parantheses.
I know it's occasionally useful to test the NULL-ness of a functin
name, of weak symbols.  In most cases, though, it's a bug.  If you
really want to check a weak symbol, just write "if ((symbol))".  That
syntax is already well known for testing the result of an assignment,
as in "if ((x = 1))" does not yield a warning but "if (x = 1)" does.
Perhaps a later GCC than 3.2.2 already has this test; if someone is
able to check, that would be nice.
Thanks muchly :)
