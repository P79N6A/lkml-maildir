That's the problem: If a the tasklet does a wakeup then the reschedule 
is delayed until the next interrupt. Testing need_resched and executing 
hlt must be atomic, but it isn't - NMIs break the atomicity.
Not a big deal, except if someone implements a tickless kernel. I think 
we can ignore it for now [or was the thread started by someone who 
want's to disable the hardware timer when the system is really idle?]
