It was intentional, and I don't actually think it was even a change. The 
access_ok() in question is not done on the actual array that we fill up 
with the result of the operation, but on the address range that is being 
queried, and if the queried address range is bogus, we should return 
ENOMEM.
It's even mentioned in the man-page..
We *do* return -EFAULT for the case where the "vec" array itself is not 
mapped.
