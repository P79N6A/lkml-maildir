I don't like this option. It is nearly free to map all of the pages to
the zero-page. You never have to allocate a page if the user never
writes to it.
Buf if you unmap the page, there could be issues. The memory region
could be on the stack, or malloc'ed. In these cases, the child should
be able to return from the function, or free the memory without
setting a timebomb.
