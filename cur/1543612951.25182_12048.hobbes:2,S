According to the 'MAINTAINERS' file, nobody. So everything related to 
the topic goes through you :-)

That's why I did not pressed you. I sent you the patch something like 
two weeks ago, but I know you have a very big amount of email, and many 
other things to test/apply/reject/whatever. I just noticed that what I 
sent to you and Linus had been merged into the 2.5 tree, which motivated 
my reply, just to know the state of the

As stated previously, there is no one for this... I only got positive 
feedback about my patches by Robert Love, but as you he did not have the 
hardware/time to test.

You're the boss ;-) As I said, I got at least 3 successful feedbacks for 
this patch, and the fact that Linux got it into the tree kinda confirms 
my thought that there might not be too many things broken in it. The 
choice of putting it into 2.4.17 or 2.4.18 is entirely yours, and I 
accept it whatever it is. Keep me informed ;-)
