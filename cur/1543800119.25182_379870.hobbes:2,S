I don't care too much whether we put always_inline or inline at the function
we _really_ want to inline.  But all others shouldn't have any inline marker.
So instead of changing the pretty useful redefinitions we have to keep the
code a little more readable what about getting rid of all the stupid inlines
we have over the place?  I think many things we have static inline in headers
now should move to proper out of line functions.  This is more work, but also
more useful than just flipping a bit.
