no that is not correct.
The api is a mix kinda and broken; it really DOES mean "shut this irq
source off". That your handler won't get called is an assumption!
You do NOT disable your handler this way.
What we really need is a disable_irq_handler() api that does both!
(you may say I'm handwaving, but if disable_irq() would disable a
handler, it for sure would have taken a "handler" argument, which it
doesn't!)
