The reason is certainly not driver allocations (either sym53c8xx version 1
or 2), since it performs all allocations of its internal data structures
directly from the page pool. OTOH, the Symbios PCI devices are quite able
to DMA the whole 32 bit physical address range.
So, they are the allocations internal to the scsi layer that may well
exhaust the ISA DMA pool. This pool is divided into 512 bytes chunks.
Under heavy reordering of IOs, it can get very fragmented and much memory
being wasted as a result.
An immediate solution might be to hack the scsi code for it to allocate
more memory.

The error string in well known since years, so you shouldn't have missed
it from sources. :-)
