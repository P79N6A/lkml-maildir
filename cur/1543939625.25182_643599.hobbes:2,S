It looks like you are using TinyBIOS.  Make sure that if you are using v0.99
that you do *not* enable the MFGPT workaround.  If you are using an older 
version, then you will need this patch:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/23/372
And enable mfgptfix on the command line.  There seems to be a problem with
the MFGPT "workaround" that causes hangs exactly like you are seeing.
