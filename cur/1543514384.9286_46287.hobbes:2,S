Ted, 
I have evidence of the interrupt routine not getting called for
extended periods, and in my case, it is clearly due to the IDE driver.
So as per your suggestion, lets get THAT darn thing fixed first. (But
I reiterate: It'd be nice if the serial driver would continue to work
perfectly even during such adverse conditions. Wishful thinking OK?)
My disk is capable of more than 5Mb per second, it doesn't do DMA
(it's on the blacklist), and pretend that I forget to do "hdparm -u
1", I see gaps in the interrupt routine calling of about 20ms.
I feel fine with gaps of about 1ms (transfer of 4k of data at 5Mb per
second), but I can't explain 20ms. Anybody know an explanation?
