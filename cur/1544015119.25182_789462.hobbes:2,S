Ick, sorry, I didn't think that any callers ever did this.

I agree.
I originally looked at changing this to be at device_add time, but I
think there are some code paths that do device_initialize and then do
some operations on the device before calling device_add.  But I could be
wrong, let me do some testing first before forcing you to make that big
change to the firewire core.

It dies a flaming horrible death, pretty much like the whole rest of the
system if allocating such a small ammount of memory is causing failures
:)
Give me a few hours to test here, your change might not be necessary...
