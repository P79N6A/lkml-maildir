I think the primary drivers we've looked at are drivers/net/tg3.c,
drivers/net/s2io.c, drivers/scsi/qla1280.c, and possibly the
qla[234]xxx series - thats probably it!
While we have USB on the systems, I don't think anyone has spend a lot
of time verifying it in this context. At least the keyboard and mouse
I have on this box seems to behave.
Cheers,
Jes
