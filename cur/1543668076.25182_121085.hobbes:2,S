Subject: PROBLEM: 2.4.21-pre6 - "mbool" causes xconfig failure
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

[1.] One line summary of the problem:
"make xconfig fails" drivers/net/Config.in: 188: unknown command
[2.] Full description of the problem/report:
Lines 188 and 189 of drivers/net/Config.in reference a define_mbool and dep_mbool
which causes xconfig to fail. Switching these to define_bool and dep_bool allows
it to work.
[3.] Keywords (i.e., modules, networking, kernel):
mbool Config.in CONFIG_EEPRO100_PIO
[4.] Kernel version (from /proc/version):
2.4.21-pre6
[5.] Output of Oops.. message (if applicable) with symbolic information
      resolved (see Documentation/oops-tracing.txt)
n/a
[6.] A small shell script or example program which triggers the
      problem (if possible)
n/a
[7.] Environment
n/a
[7.1.] Software (add the output of the ver_linux script here)
n/a
[7.2.] Processor information (from /proc/cpuinfo):
n/a
[7.3.] Module information (from /proc/modules):
n/a
[7.4.] Loaded driver and hardware information (/proc/ioports, /proc/iomem)
n/a
[7.5.] PCI information ('lspci -vvv' as root)
n/a
[7.6.] SCSI information (from /proc/scsi/scsi)
n/a
[7.7.] Other information that might be relevant to the problem
        (please look in /proc and include all information that you
        think to be relevant):
n/a
[X.] Other notes, patches, fixes, workarounds:
Just change "mbool" to "bool", not sure what the deal is here
or what an mbool is exactly.
