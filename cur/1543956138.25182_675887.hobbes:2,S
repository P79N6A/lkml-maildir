If you worry about this type of interaction, use debugfs_create_file,
which takes a fileops, and set your module owner in there so that the
reference count will not allow your module from being removed.
Also remember, you have to be root to unload modules, so if you are
doing that, and you have debugfs files open, you should know better :)
