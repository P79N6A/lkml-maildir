I have two es1371's and 2.2.16 (from RedHat 7.0) finds them fine:
es1371: version v0.22 time 16:53:18 Aug 22 2000
es1371: found chip, vendor id 0x1274 device id 0x5880 revision 0x02
es1371: found es1371 rev 2 at io 0xd400 irq 10
es1371: features: joystick 0x0
es1371: codec vendor   v (0x838476) revision 9 (0x09)
es1371: codec features 18bit DAC 18bit ADC
es1371: stereo enhancement: SigmaTel SS3D
es1371: found chip, vendor id 0x1274 device id 0x1371 revision 0x08
es1371: found es1371 rev 8 at io 0xd000 irq 9
es1371: features: joystick 0x0
es1371: codec vendor   v (0x838476) revision 9 (0x09)
es1371: codec features 18bit DAC 18bit ADC
es1371: stereo enhancement: SigmaTel SS3D
Documentation/sound/Introduction even has a section "Multiple Sound
Cards", but a simple copy of the driver and adding 
alias sound-slot-1 es1371-2nd
as suggested or a insmod es1371-2nd fails with:
Using /lib/modules/2.2.16-22/misc/es1371-2nd.o
/lib/modules/2.2.16-22/misc/es1371-2nd.o: init_module: Device or resource busy
Hint: insmod errors can be caused by incorrect module parameters, including invalid IO or IRQ parameters
Anyone know the magic "IO or IRQ parameters", or know any sites that
fully document a system with mupliple sound cards?  I'd like to put as
many as possible in one machine and am quite prepared to buy whatever
cards will work.
