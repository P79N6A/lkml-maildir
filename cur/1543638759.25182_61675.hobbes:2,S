??? Why return -1 as a void *?
The only caller of hiddev_connect is:
	if (!hiddev_connect(hid))
		hid->claimed |= HID_CLAIMED_HIDDEV;
Hm, seems like you don't want a void * there at all, but a int, right?
And as the "original" hiddev_connect returns an int, this does look like
a bug on my part, sorry.  I'll go fix it.
But that doesn't explain the error people are having with the code
compiled in.
thanks,
