It has been years since I used MS Windows much, but from my memories
of my these days, I was under the impression that it (at least the NT
line, the only surviving line these days) also maintained "last
accessed" times. Except I only ever saw it at "right now" because the
file explorer ... accesses the file before getting this metadata or
something like that (when you right-click on a file and ask for its
properties). It has creation and last modification time, too.
So, if my memories are correct, there is no performance edge to be
conceded by having atime (but one to be gained by not having atime).
