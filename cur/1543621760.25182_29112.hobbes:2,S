you have something like (function parameters supressed for simplifcation):
/* Kernel calls this in your module */
init_module()
{
do_something();
init_filesystem(...);
return whatever;
}
So the entry point for every kind of module, including filesystem 
modules, is init_module(), you don't implement init_filesystem in the 
module, you call it to let the kernel know you want to register a 
filesystem.
