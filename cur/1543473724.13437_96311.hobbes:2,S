I'm thinking the new x86 options should prolly be prefixed like:
From:
CONFIG_TSC
CONFIG_WP_WORKS_OK
etc.
To:
CONFIG_X86_TSC
CONFIG_X86_WP_WORKS_OK
I think it would make it easier down the road for people to work with.
Also instead of:
586/K5/5x86/6x86
Pentium/TSC
PPro/K6/6x86MX
For sake of less confusion:
586/K5/5x86/6x86
Pentium/PentiumMMX/TSC
PPro/P2/Celeron/K6-[123]/6x86MX
I'm thinking some people will ask about that because they don't see Pentium 2,
or Celeron anywhere..
It might be worthwhile to just show a few lines of text for each case and
keep the text needed to be typed in to a minimum to something like "3", "4",
"5" or similiar..
Little off subject, but is UP APIC worth doing? For instance if it's just a
standalone single processor P2 and/or Celeron (w/hardware hack)?
I'd be tempted to think it might be a win but I'm not very APIC-saavy.
Happy New Year (just pray they don't overplay '1999' by Prince)
