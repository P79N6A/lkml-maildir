Subject: [PATCH] MODULE_FIRMWARE for binary firmware(s)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/4/18/283

From: Jon Masters <jcm@redhat.com>
Right now, various kernel modules are being migrated over to use
request_firmware in order to pull in binary firmware blobs from userland
when the module is loaded. This makes sense.
However, there is right now little mechanism in place to automatically
determine which binary firmware blobs must be included with a kernel in
order to satisfy the prerequisites of these drivers. This affects
vendors, but also regular users to a certain extent too.
The attached patch introduces MODULE_FIRMWARE as a mechanism for
advertising that a particular firmware file is to be loaded - it will
then show up via modinfo and could be used e.g. when packaging a kernel.
