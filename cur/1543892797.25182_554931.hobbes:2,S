Well, then "default y" seems sensible for the new additions like this
case (adding a menuconfig top-dependency that was formerly a simple
menu).
Anyway, I think it's another problem of kconfig that it resets the old
values when a new top-config is introduced without "default y".
Assume the following kconfig:
	menu "Foo"
		depends on DOH
	config BAR
		bool "Bar"
		depends on DOH
	endmenu
and an old .config file
	CONFIG_DOH=y
	CONFIG_BAR=y
Now, replace menu with menuconfig:
	menuconfig FOO
		bool "Foo"
		depends on DOH
	if FOO
	config BAR
		bool "Bar"
	endif
Run make oldconfig, and you'll be asked about FOO (as expected).
Answer y, then you'll be asked again about BAR, too.
But, if "default"y is added to FOO,
	menuconfig FOO
		bool "Foo"
		default y
		depends on DOH
then it asks about FOO, but it won't ask you about BAR.
