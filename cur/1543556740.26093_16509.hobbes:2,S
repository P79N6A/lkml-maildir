Can you not just use something like gettimeofday()?  Do two consecutive calls to
find the execution time of the instruction itself, and then do two calls on
either side of the program execution.  Subtract the instruction execution time
from the delta, and that should give a pretty good idea of execution time.
On a 400Mhz G4, getttimeofday() consistantly takes 2 microseconds to run.
