How is this better than simply having your hotplug helper load
the firmware from disk ? Its nice code but you have to ask the
question "why". I don't want the firmware wasting ram, I don't
need the firmware fs wasting ram. I may need to load the right
firmware from a choice of 16 odd types (usb_serial has some
examples there).
