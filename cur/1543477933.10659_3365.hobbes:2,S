The last time I switched to a new kernel (currently I'm on pre6-ac1) I
decided to compile serial support as a module (after all I only use it
for dial-up networking and everything else associated with that is a
module)
The result was almost no throughput and quite a few
Jan 14 18:56:34 dawa kernel: sl0: transmit timed out, bad line quality?
in my logs. Accompanying them were even more
Jan 14 18:56:41 dawa kernel: Socket destroy delayed (r=0 w=96)
Since compiling the serial driver into the kernel again these have
gone away.
Has anyone else seen anything like this? Did I manage to misconfigure
my system my accident?
