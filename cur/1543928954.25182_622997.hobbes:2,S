Ok so here boot cpu LVT0 has been set to deliver any interrupt on pin
LINT0 as ExtInt. We do the same thing for kdump cpu local apic too.
I am not sure who is the guy in system who encodes the interrupt message
from 8259 to be put on hypertransport and on what basis do they decide
whether it should go to only cpu0 or a broadcast one. Looks like in this
case it is going to cpu0 only. That means we are left with no choice but
to work on patch to initialize IOAPIC early.
Thanks
Vivek
