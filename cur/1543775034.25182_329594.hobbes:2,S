Even home users have started to set up raid mirrors at home now that
disk space is cheap. That's a step in the right direction, I
suppose, with hardware never being good.
Taking backups in an environment where you need a few hundred GiB
backed up is not that difficult.
Get a separate, redundant box with a big tape changer and drop
periodical backups off at your bank's vault.
Get a separate, very reduntant box, with a truckload of proven 
drives in a separate raid box and run your stuff there.
Get both of the above.
If Joe Sixpack loses his mp3 collection, I don't really care,
nor should anyone else. Anything important enough to care
about is easy enough to back up. Always.
Arrogance? Maybe.

Reiserfs does not fall apart utterly every time some bug breaths on it.

Rather I take backups, buy better hardware and understand there's a
risk involved.
Computers as a complete set can't be trusted, you can only make
the best accomodations you can.
