 I tried to get my local bank to fix their internet banking service about a
month ago. I ran into a 'brick wall'. They only support Windows and MacOS,
since neither currently implement ECN, they don't have a problem :-(
 The only answer I got is 'we don't support Linux'. The operator tried
to find some one interested in the network, but the answer was always
the same. 'We don't support.....'
 They actually suggested I 'upgrade' my browser at one point!
 Their service actually works perfectly with Netscape and Linux 2.4.x
(as long as ECN is disabled).
