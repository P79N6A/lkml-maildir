Hi, folks,
<lurking-mode-off>
  since I'm subscribed to about 30 mailing lists, I've
  gotten nearly 5.5 MB of mails during the last two days.
  About 2 MB of that is from linux-kernel alone.           :-)
  Scanning this list I realize that
    241 KB
  are occupied by this thread.
  These are 12% of linux-kernel bandwith ... :-((
Conclusions:
1) PLEASE, STOP THIS SILLY THREAD !
2) People who feel offended by such "bad" messages should
   consider that Linux is a GPL'ed software.  So they
   are free to change all "offending" comments and/or
   printk texts and may then run a "clean" Linux....   :--))
</lurking-mode-off>
Sincerly Yours
Rolf
PS: Please forgive my bad english   :^)
