I have to admit, the -rc1 caught me a bit by surprise; I have a few 
patches pending that I want to send out today.
The question is, if we had to break glibc compatibility, shouldn't we 
use the opportunity to clean-up the syscall list? It was copied from 
MIPS and, thus, has inherited a lot of legacy from there. As a new 
architecture, maybe we should even go as far as removing all ni-syscalls 
and start fresh?

I will try out your patch and see if there are any obvious problems.
Thanks,
