Should IDE driver read back parameters after writing them before issuing 
the command? That should fix this problem. (except when command is written 
badly)

I have seen one WD drive bought in 2003 having error in its firmware in 
cache-coherency code --- if you read and write 256 sectors to the same 
places with some pattern repeatedly (with direct IO), it will discard a 
write. It happens only with 256-sector writes, maybe some part of firmware 
treats 256 as 0. Maybe I create testcase sometimes.
