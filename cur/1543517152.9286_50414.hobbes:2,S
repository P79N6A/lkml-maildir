I double-checked on this for sanity's sake, and this is definitely the
case.
There is no read-around-write reordering going on here, and the stores
are in order.
In the example:
cpu1: Store 1 => A
	read B
cpu2: Store 0 => B
	Store 0 => A
...and assuming that if you hadn't seen the store to B from cpu2 on
cpu1 yet (i.e. didn't get a 0 for read B), then you'd definitely get
a 0 for A...
that's the problem.  cpu1's store into A may still be in it's queue of
committed but not-yet-externally-observed stores, so when cpu2's
stores come along, still nicely in order, mind you, then 
That's also why the serializing store into A for cpu1 fixes it, you're
simply draining the store queue, and so you're sure that if you observe
the new value of B *later* than the "read B", then the new value of
A can't be messed up by anything in the store queue.
So, as I said before, IA32 isn't reordering anything in a visible way,
it's effectively "shielding" the address on cpu1 because it hasn't
gotten out of it's store queue yet.
