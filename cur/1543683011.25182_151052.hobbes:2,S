I'm sure that using a register for current was the right thing to do at
the time.  One problem with a global register approach is that the more
inlining the code uses,  the more like the compiler is going to want
that extra register :-)

Sounds like something that can at least be made conditional on SMP.
I'll look into it for m68knommu since it is more likely to care about "size"
than SMP.

So should the trend be away from inlining,  especially larger functions ?
I know on m68k some of the really simple inlines are actually smaller as
an inline than as a function call.  But they have to be very simple,  or
only used once.
