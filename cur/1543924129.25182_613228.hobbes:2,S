Hi List,
When the asus-laptop module is loaded it automatically turns on my 
wireless led
light irregardless of the whether or not the my wireless is up or not. I 
had previously
been using the out of kernel asus-laptop module, which no longer 
compiles because of
missing some structure definition, Andreas Kempe had added a module 
parameter to
the out of tree version that let the module be loaded with the led off 
by passing
wled=0 as a parameter.
Can this be added to the in kernel version? Or the default for the 
wireless led be off
when loading the module?
Thanks,
Steve
