Lots of issues here, writing in random blocks can lead to fragmentation 
if the data is newly allocated, but won't change fragmenting if the page 
mapped is alread allocated on the disk.
Is it practical or desirable to be writing mapped pages of allready 
allocated files back more readily, since it avoid all the allocation 
issues? But you still need to limit dirty pages, so at some point it 
will be necessary to do the allocation, preferably in an optimal way.
