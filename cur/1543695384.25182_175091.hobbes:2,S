If this condition triggers, the lists are corrupt and the kernel
should not try to access this socket in any way whatsoever
past this point.
Therefore it should OOPS, which is exactly what it does now.
A BUG_ON() is an equivalent response as far as I am concerned,
it has the same exact result, and the backtrace shows where the
problem is occuring.
