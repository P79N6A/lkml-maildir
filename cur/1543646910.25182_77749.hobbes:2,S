Hello!

Me too.
Sigh... that's why code is full of __constant_* in the most unexpected places.
For my straight brains it is much easier to use __constant_* each time when
I know forward that it is a constant instead of keeping in mind all
the gcc bugs. Well, the beast which does not eliminate empty loops,
is unlikely to eliminate if (is_constant_p()) too, right? :-)
