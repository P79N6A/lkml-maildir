This time linux has died when un-installing a debian package from a remote
ssh terminal, so it might be related to ReiserFS.
There is no logs, sysrq didn't work neither.
Several files are corrupted:
linux:/var/log# dpkg -i "kernel-source*"
dpkg: error processing kernel-source* (--install):
 cannot access archive: No such file or directory
Errors were encountered while processing:
 kernel-source*
(i tried to remove kernel-source-2.4.7 when the machine hung).
