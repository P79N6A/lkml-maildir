I don't think so. The core problem is not that we are doing unlock/sleep/lock
with this patch. The thing is: work->func() can't take wq_mutex (and thus use
flush_work/workqueue) because it is possible that CPU_DEAD holds this mutex
and waits for us to complete(kthread_stop_info). I believe this bug is old.

Ok, thanks for acknowledgement.

I am thinking about the same right now. Probably we can do something like this:
	int xxx_lock(void)
	{
		for (;;) {
			if (mutex_trylock(wq_mutex))
				return 1;
			// the owner of wq_mutex sleeps, we can proceed
			if (kthread_should_stop())
				return 0;
		}
	}
	void xxx_unlock(int yesno)
	{
		if (yesno)
			mutex_unlock(wq_mutext);
	}
and then do
	locked = xxx_lock();
	...
	xxx_unlock(locked);
in flush_xxx() instead of plain lock/unlock.
Yes, ugly. I'll try to do something else on weekend.

I'll take a look later, thanks.
