To me, this sounds more like our tools are too stupid.  Ok, I don't
like to copy&paste conditions either, but in many header files, those
comments are the lesser evil.  If we cannot put every #endif on the
same screen (24 lines) as the corresponding #if, they do help.
What we do need is a version of cpp, that only removes comments.  Then
we can pipe all input for our tools through that cppp or whatever it
would be called, and noone would worry about comments confusing the
tools anymore.
All right, here is a patch that simply corrects the typo.  Linus, you
decide which one is better.
