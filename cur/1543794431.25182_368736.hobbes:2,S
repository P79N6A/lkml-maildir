It flushes the cachelines that correspond to an address.  By design the
IA64 instruction cache does not detect self modifying code, so an
instruction can be changed in memory but the old instruction can still
be in cache.  ia64_fc is used to flush the changed cacheline to ensure
that you execute the modified instruction.

You will have to be more specific about your question, what are you
trying to do with the syscall table?  Since you are also asking about
ia64_fc I guess that you are trying to patch the syscall table, and the
standard answer to that is "DO NOT PATCH THE SYSCALL TABLE!".  It is
not supported and will not be supported.
