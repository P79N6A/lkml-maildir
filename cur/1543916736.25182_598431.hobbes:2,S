OK, here 'tis:
===
Normalize config options for guest support
1) Group all the "guest OS" support options together, under a PARAVIRT_GUEST
   menu.
2) Make those options select CONFIG_PARAVIRT, as suggested by Andi.
3) Make kconfig help titles consistent.

 	  VMI provides a paravirtualized interface to the VMware ESX server
 	  (it could be used by other hypervisors in theory too, but is not
