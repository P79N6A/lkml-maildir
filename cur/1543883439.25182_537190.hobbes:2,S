Amen.
Both of those are show-stoppers. It may be ok for kernel developers, but 
it's not good for random people. It's one of the reasons I don't generally 
use bugzilla for other projects - if they require me to sign up etc, they 
can take care of their own bugs.
(For the same reason I consider closed mailing lists to be useless for 
bugreports. If you have to be a member to send email, it's not a 
bug-report thing, it's just a secret society).
I realize that spam is a problem, but there are better spam solutions than 
alienating the people who just want to send a report.
Also, I don't know if anybody has ever tried to avoid sending duplicate 
bugs, but every time I use bugzilla to send a bug-report (which I do for 
things like FC7 live CD's breaking etc where I care enough, and I have a 
bugzilla account on that bugzilla _anyway_ for other reasons), I am ready 
to _kill_ somebody whenever I see that "humorous" 
	zarro bugs found
message, after it made it almost impossible for me to even figure out how 
to do a good search in the first place!
So I gnash my teeth, and fill in the bug report anyway, and if it's a 
duplicate becasue bugzilla didn't have any sane way to get any kind of 
overview at all, hey, it's a duplicate. Nothing I can do about it.
And the reason I gnash my teeth is that I realize that because I can't 
even get any overview of the bugzilla entries as a random submitter (and 
dammit, I probably have a better idea of what the problem might be than 
most people), I sure as hell can't expect a random user to be better. So I 
bet my bad reports are a lot better than the average, and a lot of people 
probably just give up and don't report anything at all.
