Now especially Intel tells everybody in their Pentium Optimization 
manuals to *use* lea whereever possible as this operation doesn't depend 
on the ALU and is processed in other parts of the CPU.
Sample quote from said manual (P/N 248966-05):
"Use the lea instruction and the full range of addressing modes to do 
address calculation"
I would guess Intel would add caveats about such stalls in this manual 
if there would be any.
