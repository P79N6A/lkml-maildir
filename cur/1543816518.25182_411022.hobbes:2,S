Well, actually I was using vim, and although I know how to configure  
shortcuts like that; do we really want to force people to use  
shortcuts and abbreviations to be able to sanely edit the ABI code?   
Isn't that counterproductive with the desire to get the maintainers  
fixing up their own ABIs?  Plus all the extra verbiage tends to make  
the lines too long (80-column limit) and makes it harder to read.
Cheers,
