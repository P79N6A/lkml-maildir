If you are talking about ac9, then you should know that ac9 is BROKEN. It
registers virtual device address instead of physical.
It is from my ac9, you can see strange region d2864000 and nothing
registered for real region at e3000000 :-( After change, you'll get nice
indented eth0 at e3000000.

You must obtain physical address:
{
    unsigned long physbase;
    physbase = pdev->resource[(pci_tbl[chip_idx].pci_flags >> 4) & 0xF].start;
    if (pci_tbl[chip_idx].pci_flags & PCI_USES_IO)
        request_region(physbase, pci_tbl[chip_idx].io_size, dev->name);
    else
        request_mem_region(physbase, pci_tbl[chip_idx].io_size, dev->name);
}
Using physbase instead of ioaddr is important part of change... But adding
this to all Donalds drivers does not look like intelligent solution to me...
pci_scan now does check_{mem_,}region, so why it could not do
request_{mem_,}region too? When we can add five lines into pci's scan.c
and remove 8 lines from each network driver, benefit looks clear to me.
