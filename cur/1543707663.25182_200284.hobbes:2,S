I've not used it, but I have plenty of ideas (see the other email),
and one big project I'm working on that intends to use it, which isn't
a file manager.
I must say it is badly designed and I don't like it :)
Actually the design is ok because it's easy to understand.  It is just
a bit limiting for more adventurous purposes than a file manager.
Something that fitted nicely into the epoll style of event queue, and
also allowed whole directory trees to be monitored, and told exactly
what changed, and let you take out leases on files that caught writing
as well as opens, and worked even across reboots or with no program
running (using generation numbers of some kind).... that I'd like a
tiny bit more :)
