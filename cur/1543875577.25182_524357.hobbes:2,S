I don't see any point in deregistering a kernel device, if the event
to userspace goes wrong, or a subsytem returns a non-zero value in the
filter.
Checking the uevent return value, will not prevent any malfunction,
usually this kind of "error handling" just prevents bringing up a
whole subsystem, or booting-up a box, because the needed device does
not exist at all.
