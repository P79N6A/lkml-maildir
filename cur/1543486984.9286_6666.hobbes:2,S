        That may be true, but for the past weeks or so, It has been constantly
located at 
ftp://egcs.cygnus.com/pub/glibc.
 That is where I downloaded it, as
well as the crypt from 2.0.112, which I am having trouble compiling.
unfortunately, I need crypt() for a couple of programs, which unfortunately,
the proper version wasn't compiled into the binary dist of glibc-2.0.7pre6,
that I have. Ah well. still waiting for all the politics to die down, and work
to resume...
