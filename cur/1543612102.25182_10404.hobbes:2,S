The code reads a 64bit detect flag from the ns chip - so I guess it
must be bogus with some motherboards. Mine is okay. Ben??

Okay, so i'll move the register_netdev call earlier on in the
initialisation and add any necessary unregister call for failures.

The card issues multiple interrupts during auto-negotiation. If you
change the dprintk to a printk on the line with the tbisr=, tanar=,
you'll see the details of the phy interrupt. The driver needs a link
status variable so we then only print link status changes when
link status changes. The current problem is purely cosmetic.
