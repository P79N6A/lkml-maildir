Dear Rusty,
We generally prefer to focus on making stuff work for users,
rather than waste time arguing about controversial GPL politics.
That's why after the practical workaround was done we moved on
to deal with more acute technical issues at the time and failed
to properly discuss/follow up on the matter with you. Please accept my
sincere personal apology for this.
I would like however to point out that part of the reason why people
sometimes resort to such kludges is that some kernel maintainers have
been rather reluctant to accommodate proprietary drivers which
unfortunately are a necessary real-world evil (Linus told me just a few
days ago that he didn't care and to "go away" after we requested a clean
solution to handle larger kernel stacks for "foreign" NDIS drivers in a 
way
that could perhaps coexist with the new 4K stacks used by default in
recent 2.6.6/fedora kernels).
Anyway, in an effort to reasonably resolve the \0 issue, to (hopefully) 
mutual
satisfaction I propose that we update our drivers to explicitly set the 
tainted
bit manually after they are loaded - perhaps via sysctl() or by running
"echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/tainted" via {modules,modprobe}.conf,
or simply changing the '\0' to ' ' in one of the modules' 
MODULE_LICENSE()
macro, causing the kernel to be tainted upon load and the confusing 
messages
to appear once instead of 5-6 times in a row. The latter approach seems
simple and straightforward. Would it be acceptable to you as a 
compromise until
your patch and hopefully something equivalent for 2.4 propagate to 
users?
Regards
Marc
