Um, I'm really reluctant to do this without an incredibly good reason.
Illegal is a defined term under the SCSI standards, and the messages you
are changing actually appear with the word Illegal in the actual
ASC/ASCQ definition.  If I accept this patch, you'll no longer be able
to look the messages up in the relevant standard:

By a simple text search.
I don't think the pedantry is worth the confusion ...
