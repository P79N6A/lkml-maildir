A few remarks after a quick glance at zaptel-0.2.0 
- copy_{to/from}_user() may sleep. Don't call it with spinlock held
  (see Documentation/DocBook/kernel-locking.tmpl)
- avoid unchecked copy_{to/from}_user() and friends.
- the failure paths aren't consistent: sometime goto, sometime not.
- the failure paths don't always do their job regarding kmalloc/kfree balance
- fcstab[] declaration is duplicated
- please put blank lines after variables declarations in function body
- zt_common_ioctl/zt_ctl_ioctl() on less than 14/24 screens would be nice

The kernel parts are appropriate imho (hint, hint: split these from userspace
code in zaptel package). Cosmetic/CodingStyle issues apart, bugs are lurking
in the code.
