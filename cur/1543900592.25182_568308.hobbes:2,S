Ok, we have incorporated some of the feedback from you guys and made a
new drop: rt2
Changes:
*) split into series
*) split the rt patch into two sections.  The first is .21.5-rt19 after
it applies to 2.6.22 minus the rejects.  The second patch is the
resolution of those rejects + our fixes (sorry, dont have this broken
down finer grained yet) (Thanks to Daniel for this suggestion)
*) We rolled Alessio's fix for duplication of div64 into the rt patch
*) We added Alessio's fix for percpu to the series
Notably missing:
*) We are still at rt19.  We will push rt20 in shortly, and rt21 as
available.
You can find the patch here:

Thanks for the feedback, guys!
Regards,
-Greg
