Subject: [BUG] undefined reference to `kobject_actions'

Many ARM platforms fail to build with the following:
drivers/built-in.o: In function `store_uevent':
hid-input.c:(.text+0x19c4c): undefined reference to `kobject_actions'
It appears that if hotplug is disabled, kobject_actions is ifdef'd
away but hid-input still references it.
