Not necessarily. When the joystick is plugged in, you want to load the 
hardware driver modules. There's really no need for the userspace interface 
until someone requests it. At least that's the way I see it.
And in any case, even if you do want to load joydev.o when the joystick is 
plugged in, I don't see how that could be done on-demand when the joystick 
port isn't hotplug compatible, such as is the case with gameports, right?
