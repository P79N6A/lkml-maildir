My proposed patchset includes three accounting data collection
patches and one CSA loadable module that make use of the
collected data. The three data collection patches (in the area
of io, mm and end-of-process) do not conflict with BSD accounting
or ELSA. They can be viewed as "enhancement" to both BSD and
ELSA as Guillaume, the maintainer of ELSA put it:
    Therefore the solution could be to enhance BSD accounting with data
    collection from CSA and provide per job accounting with a userspace
    mechanism. Sounds great to me...
It would be then up to BSD, ELSA or CSA to decide how to process
the collected data and present it to users.
All response so far seems to favor this unified data collection
method proposal.
The ELSA approach appears to make changes to kernel/acct.c while
CSA will provide its own loadable module.
Of the three data collection patches, csa_io and csa_eop are very
much CSA-independent. I certainly can make csa_mm more so as well.
I think it is a everyone-win situation for all three projects. :)
