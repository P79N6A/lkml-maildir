   Architectures define tlb_flush_mm() as appropriate, on x86 it would
   be just flush_tlb_mm(mm), on Sparc/PPC/etc. which uses the VMA
   flushing it would just be a NOP.
Actually, there are some issues with my suggestion.
We are trying to do two things:
1) Flush all VMAs
2) Flush some unmapped area (1 or a few VMAs)
In the #1 case we'd like that to turn into something like:
	flush_cache_mm()
	for each vma {
		unmap_page_range();
	}
	tlb_finish_mmu();
	flush_tlb_mm();
Whereas in the #2 case it should look like:
	for each vma {
		tlb_start_vma(vma...);
		tlb_end_vma(vma...);
	}
	tlb_finish_mmu();
We have to reposition that tlb.h:flush_tlb_mm() call somehow to
make this a reality.
The next issue is how to make it so that this infrstructure
can allow us to kill off the buggy flush_tlb_pgtables() thing.
