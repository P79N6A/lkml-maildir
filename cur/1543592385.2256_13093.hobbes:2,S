Yeah, I know.  The point is I wanted to know if people were interested in
the approach.  Man, nobody's capable of being a visionary anymore.

You're missing a few subtle points:
	1. reservations are against a specific zone
	2. try_to_free_pages uses the swap reservation
	3. irqs can no longer eat memory allocations that are needed for
	   swap
Note that with this patch the current garbage in the zone structure with
pages_min (which doesn't work reliably) becomes obsolete.

You're completely wrong here.
