This is incorrect information.  Abit BP6 early revs suffered under load
from a 100uF cap (EC10, between the CPU sockets) that should have been
1500uF.  This was compounded by a weak or otherwise inadequate power
supply.
Having run literally 7 P3F-Fs and 6 of their P2B-F predecessors, not a
single one had any problems.  They were the premiere overclocking boards
of their day.
rgds,
Tim.
