Subject: Overlapping MTRRs in 2.6.1
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I get the following message in the kernel log when X starts up:
mtrr: 0xe0000000,0x4000000 overlaps existing 0xe0000000,0x1000000
mtrr: 0xe0000000,0x4000000 overlaps existing 0xe0000000,0x1000000
[drm:radeon_cp_init] *ERROR* radeon_cp_init called without lock held
[drm:radeon_unlock] *ERROR* Process 1807 using kernel context 0
The complaint with radeon_unlock occurred in 2.4 for a while until I realized
that agpgart wasn't loading before radeon; that fixed it, but now it's returned
with 2.6 and I think the mtrr error is the cause.  In XFree86.log, I get the
single-line message
(WW) RADEON(0): Failed to set up write-combining range (0xe0000000,0x4000000)
and then, further down,
(WW) RADEON(0): [agp] AGP not available
and finally,
(II) RADEON(0): Direct rendering disabled
I checked the archives and no one has posted a message on MTRR overlaps since
2002.  At that time, Andrew Rodland wrote something about what appears to be
this exact problem; a link to it is
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=102133293210888&w=2
It would seem this hasn't gotten fixed entirely, then.  For comparison, 'cat
/proc/mtrr' gives
reg00: base=0x00000000 (   0MB), size= 256MB: write-back, count=1
reg01: base=0xe8000000 (3712MB), size=  64MB: write-combining, count=1
reg02: base=0xe0000000 (3584MB), size=  16MB: write-combining, count=1
My video card is a Radeon 7000, 64M of memory; processor, Athlon 2600+;
motherboard, Shuttle AN35N with NForce2 chipset.
