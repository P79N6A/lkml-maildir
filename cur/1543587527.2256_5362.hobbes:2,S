	I applied these patches to 2.4.3-ac5, and it made a world
of difference. I can run kernel compiles, things like 'find /',
and move between desktops running netscape, mutt with 15000
messages threaded, etc. without sloggy delays... eg. previously
netscape used to take a second or so to repaint under this type
of 'load' upon returning to it from a brief visit to another
desktop.
	This is a subjective assesment of my desktop type system,
k6-333 with 64M; 2.4 is much more usable for me now.
	If anyone wants me to run specific tests, I am willing.
