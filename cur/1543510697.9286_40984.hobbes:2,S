Agreed, as I remarked in the bottom of the message you're replying to but
conveniently ignored in your reply. The initial suggestion that started
this thread was to write manpage-like documentation for kernel internals.
This capital-D formalized Documentation is what I'm objecting to. It's
evil.

Actually, _most_ programmers in the real world don't know how to write
decent code and they instead write lots of design documents and insist on
tons of meaningless comments. They'll write classes to encapsulate a for
loop so it can be made reusable and complain when you don't use their
class library. In fact, lots of companies have crap like this enshrined in
their "code quality" guidelines. Thou shalt put function documentation in
front of every function, thou shalt use silly Hungarian notation, thou
shalt write a design document more tedious than the actual coding before
you've even started, thou shalt make everything a giant switch statement,
thou shalt think ActiveX is clever. Fortunately, these people rarely try
to hack kernel code due to the lack of documentation.

Maybe. But they sure as hell wrote a lot of Documentation. Many CDROMs
worth. You can be sure they did tons internally as well - probably for all
their DLL entry points.
