Subject: [PATCH v7 2/8] sched: Framework for sched_mc/smt_power_savings=N
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/18/231

From: Gautham R Shenoy <ego@in.ibm.com>
Currently the sched_mc/smt_power_savings variable is a boolean,
which either enables or disables topology based power savings.
This patch extends the behaviour of the variable from boolean to
multivalued, such that based on the value, we decide how
aggressively do we want to perform powersavings balance at
appropriate sched domain based on topology.
Variable levels of power saving tunable would benefit end user to
match the required level of power savings vs performance
trade-off depending on the system configuration and workloads.
This version makes the sched_mc_power_savings global variable to
take more values (0,1,2).  Later versions can have a single
tunable called sched_power_savings instead of
sched_{mc,smt}_power_savings.
