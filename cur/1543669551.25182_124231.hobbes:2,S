    Unless you fix all programs which scan /dev/sg*, you better keep 
    the used range dense, so this not really option.
That only holds for the first 256 minors (of the first 8 majors).
Since we want to be completely backwards compatible, nothing
changes there.
But people who want to use new features must update their programs
or at least recompile.
