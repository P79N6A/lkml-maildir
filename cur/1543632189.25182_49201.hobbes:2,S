It depends on how much work the patch author wants to do.  This is a 
perfectly reasonable request, but increases the complexity of the 
overall problem somewhat.
Your current solution, whatever it is, should map directly onto one of 
the 'generic kernel' selections, hopefully.  So, what you are really 
asking for is an RFE to add on to this RFE currently being discussed :)
