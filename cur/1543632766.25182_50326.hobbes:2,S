Just FYI, this is probably an optimally bad choice for the default disk
spinup interval, as many laptops spindown timers in the same ballpark.
I would say 15-20 minutes or more, unless there is a huge amount of
VM pressure or something.  Otherwise, you will quickly have a dead
laptop harddrive from the overly-frequent spinup/down cycles.
Yes, minutae, I know.  Otherwise a nice idea.
Cheers, Andreas
