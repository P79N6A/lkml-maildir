Subject: user-mode port 0.33-2.4.0-test10 - Fixed patch
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2000/11/3/179

After I generated the patch, I noticed some stuff I didn't want to release, so 
I edited the patch by hand, and of course, messed it up.
So, the new patch is available at 
http://sourceforge.net/project/filelist.php?g
roup_id=429 as usual.
