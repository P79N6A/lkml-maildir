It would mean a check when putting a file handle, which would be unpleasant
if not handled very carefully.
How about doing this in fput ?
	if(IS_REVOKED(file) && file->f_ops != &revoked_ops)
	{
		file->f_ops = &revoked_ops;
		wake_up(&fop_wait);
	}
that would mean that the ops change is done by the code paths that care about
the handle at the point it becomes unused. We could use a poll_table like
setup to handle the multi-fd wait if need be
How we make sure drivers return out of wait for event loops would need a bit
of thought but I think thats an unrelated problem.
