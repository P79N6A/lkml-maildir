no, it doesn't mean that the chip supports 44.1kHz.
it shows that your sound chip is driven in the detected clock.
usually it's 48000, but in some cases, it's based on PCI clock and
runs in different speed.
or, it could be a bug of detection routine, which might be influenced
by cpufreq, etc.
if the sound is too slow, please give the option ac97_clock=48000
manually.
