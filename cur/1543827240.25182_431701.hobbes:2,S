Er, no.  I'm not aware of many filesystems that are in the same
league as XFS on those first three specific points.  It certainly
has "ondisk sophistication" very well covered, trust me. ;)
We are definately not lagging on handling large devices nor high
bandwidth I/O anyway - XFS serves up very close to the hardware
capabilities for high end hardware and it scales well.  One could
come up with a different list of areas where Linux filesystems
might be lagging, but that list above ain't right.

*nod*.
