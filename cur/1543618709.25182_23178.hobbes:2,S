Yes. The netfilter changes as of 2.4.17-pre7 have been:
o have mangle teable attach to all five hooks
  (Brad Chapman & me)
o new match for SPI field in AH/ESP ipsec headers (broken1)
  (Yon Uriarte)
o new ULOG target for high performance userspace packet logging (broken1)
  (me)
o fix skb_headroom reallocation after destination change (your bug)
  (Rusty Russell, Marc Boucher & me)
o fix REDIRECT handling of artificial TCP RST's generated by REJECT
  (Marc Boucher)
o fix debugging code for ip_fw_compat.c
  (Rusty Russell)
o fix bug when using REDIRECT and no IP address is attached to
  an interface 
  (Lennert Buytenhek)
o add ip_queue (and QUEUE target) support for IPv6
  (Fernando Anton & James Morris)
o fix printing of inner ICMP packet (if icmp in icmp errmsg) in LOG target
  (Jozsef Kadlecsik)
o fix typo in errormessage of ipv6 MARK target
  (Dave Jones)
o increase module usage count as soon as there are rules in iptables
  (me)
o increase module usage count as soon as there are rules in ipchains
  (me)
o increase module usage count as soon as there are rules in ipfwadm (broken2)
  (Rusty Russell)
broken1: broken because the final kernel tree was strangely missing two
	 .c files which had been inside the patch 
         (davem and marcelo taking care of this)
broken2: broken because I was too lazy. Patch has appeared on lkml and is
         submitted for kernel inclusion.
