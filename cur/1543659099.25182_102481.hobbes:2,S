Yes, this is what was called define_bool in the old kconfig.
E.g.
config QUOTACTL
        bool
        depends on XFS_QUOTA || QUOTA
        default y
says that QUOTACTL is automatically selected if XFS_QUOTA or QUOTA is 
selected. This is a config option that is never visible to the user 
configuring the kernel.
