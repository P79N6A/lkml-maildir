Broken disk, overclocked CPU, overheated CPU, bad RAM, bad controller, bad
IDE cable, cable not seated right, cable is too near a source of electrical
interference, cable too long, ...
I've seen cases where you needed to cold reboot the machine after
partitioning (dumb BIOS?).
In any case, without further details about the errors, anything we could
tell you is just (wild) guesses.
