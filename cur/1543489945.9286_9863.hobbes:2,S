In article <199903141830.TAA28416@sagem.fr> you write:
> I have trouble here mounting NFS exported partitions from a 2.2.1-ac6

Works here.
Server: Linux-2.2.3 (both userland nfsd [2.2beta29] and kernel nfsd [981204])
Client: FreeBSD/Alpha (4.0-19990206 snapshot)
I suggest you try 2.2.3 or 2.2.3acX (whatever X).
Hope this helps.
