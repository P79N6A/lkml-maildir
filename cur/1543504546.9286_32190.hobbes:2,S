Oh c'mon. It's not the first time that building/running the kernel
required certain versions of programs. So at least for me this is a
non issue.

People coding for the kernel have to get used to at&t syntax anyway
and then you'd have the added benefit of using the same syntax,
disregarding of whether you're doing 16 or 32 assembly.
*And* you get rid of another tool dependency.
