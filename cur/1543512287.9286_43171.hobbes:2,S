Bullshit, any time you rebuild /dev you lose permissions.
If you run "/dev/MAKEDEV floppy"  you lose permissions.
The only difference with devfs is that the "whole package"
includes a userspace daemon to preserve permissions
across those boundries since they occur more often.
You might hit your foot if you aimed a bit more to the left.

The whole network architecture as it exists does so because 
classical Major/minor devices are inadequate for the job
and too difficult to manage for the level of dynamics network
interfaces can exhibit.

The same set of problems keep having to be solved in
different ways BECAUSE we have not had a good dynamic
filesystem.

You who are doing the bandying of the cases you care least about are

I have seen more systems broken because some script or sysadmin changed
permissions on a file than I have seen broken because they couldn't.
Purely subjective stuff, but I am convinced.

Modems, ethernet, mouse, I don't need much.
And the current userspace solution for PCMCIA does deal with it
OK, no fault there. But the PCMCIA people had to do an awful
lot of work to get it working cleanly, work that devfs would have
saved them (reinventing the wheel yet again).

Removing devices willy-nilly like you propose in the previous

That guy had better be modifying his kernel then, cause he will have
bigger security problems than mere device permissions. Modifying the
default permissions while he is there will be trivial.

Useful, if you are recovering from a security breach and somebody
helpfully changed all your permissions on you.

My driver required no changes to work.
devfs made it possible to do things that were still compatible
with standard devices, but only _useful_ under devfs.
Note: THE CHANGES WERE SIMPLER AND MADE POSSIBLE, they did not
BREAK ANYTHING without devfs.

Then why do we need UUID's, PCMCIA management daemons, a whole different
architecture for networking, /proc full of devices and config files?
These are all answers to the _same_problem_set_, and a dynamic /dev
gives a much better start on the next iteration of the problem.
