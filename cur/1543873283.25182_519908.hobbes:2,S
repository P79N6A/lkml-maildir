Subject: [PATCH 0/3] VM throttling: avoid blocking occasional writers

Hi,
I ported the patch sent before to 2.6.21-rc3-mm2, so I'm resending it.
( Previous patch is available at
  
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=117223267512340&w=2
 )
-Summary:
I have observed a problem that write(2) can be blocked for a long time
if a system has several disks and is under heavy I/O pressure. This
patchset is to avoid the problem by introducing high/low water-mark
algorithm to balance_dirty_pages() function.
-Example of the probrem:
There are two processes on a system which has two disks. Process-A
writes heavily to disk-a, and process-B writes small data (e.g. log
files) to disk-b occasionally. A portion of system memory, which is
depends on vm.dirty_ratio (typically 40%), is filled up with Dirty
and Writeback pages of disk-a.
In this situation, write(2) of process-B could be blocked for a very
long time (more then 60 seconds), although the load of disk-b is quite
low. In particular, the system would become quite slow, if disk-a is
slow (e.g. backup to an USB disk).
This seems to be the same problem as discussed in LKML:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=115559902900003
and
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=117182340400003
-Cause:
I found this problem is caused by the balance_dirty_pages().
While Dirty+Writeback pages get more than 40% of memory, process-B is
blocked in balance_dirty_pages() until writeback of some (`write_chunk',
typically = 1536) dirty pages on disk-b is started.
However, because disk-b has only a few dirty pages, the process-B will
be blocked until writeback to disk-a is completed and Dirty+Writeback
goes below 40%.
-Solution:
I consider that all of the dirty pages for the disk have been written
back and that the disk is clean if a process cannot write 'write_chunk'
pages in balance_dirty_pages().
To avoid using up the free memory with dirty pages by passing blocking,
this patchset adds a new threshold named vm.dirty_limit_ratio to sysctl.
It modifies balance_dirty_pages() not to block when the amount of
Dirty+Writeback is less than vm.dirty_limit_ratio percent of the memory.
In the other cases, writers are throttled as current Linux does.
In this patchset, vm.dirty_limit_ratio, instead of vm.dirty_ratio, is
used as the clamping level of Dirty+Writeback. And, vm.dirty_ratio is
used as the level at which a writers will itself start writeback of the
dirty pages.
-Testing Results:
In the situation explained in "Example of the problem" section, I
measured time of write(2)ing to disk-b.
The write was completed by 30ms or less under the kernel with this
patchset.
When nr_requests is set too high (e.g. 8192), Dirty+Writeback grows near
vm.dirty_limit_ratio(45% of system memory by defaults). In that case,
write(2) sometimes took about 1 second.
This patchset can be applied to 2.6.21-rc3-mm2.
It consists of 3 pieces:
1/3 - add a sysctl variable `vm.dirty_limit_ratio'
2/3 - modify get_dirty_limits() to return the limit of dirty pages.
3/3 - break out of balance_dirty_pages() loop if the disk doesn't have
      remaining dirty pages, if Dirty+Writeback < vm.dirty_limit_ratio.
