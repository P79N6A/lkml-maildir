If I read this correctly, the problem is with JFS rather than RAID? Have 
you tried not mounting the JFS filesystem but just starting the array 
which crashes, so you can read bits of it, etc, and verify that the 
array itself is working?
And can you run an fsck on the filesystem, if that makes sense? I assume 
you got to actually write a f/s at one time, and I've never used JFS 
under Linux. I spent five+ years using it on AIX, though, complex but 
robust.
