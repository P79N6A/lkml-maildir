In general the inlines should be __KERNEL__'d anyway.  In any case, the
prior art in <linux/types.h> is:
#if defined(__GNUC__) && !defined(__STRICT_ANSI__)
typedef         __u64           uint64_t;
typedef         __u64           u_int64_t;
typedef         __s64           int64_t;
#endif
Or did I miss something at the beginning of this conversation?
[Debian is already using similar patches, which disable the 64-bit
swabbing in __STRICT_ANSI__.]
