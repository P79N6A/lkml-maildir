But the problem is like comparing CISC and RISC processors/code.
If you see the CISC assembler you do not see anything.
If you look at RISC code you can know many things about how the processor
pipelines are organized (you see interleaved float/int ops), you see how
much pipelines are there, what they do, and so on. Compare (hypothetically)
an ATI engine with 2 matrix-vector-multiply units and an nVidia with
8 dot product units. Perhaps ATI thought about doing matrices in parallel,
but never thought on doing rows in parallel. You could know that looking
at the code. Or at the programming specs ('load each row of your transform
in registers r0..r3 ....' )
I do not know how big are the ATI drivers, but looking at the nVidia ones,

12 Mb of code is too much for a wrapper that just loads the hardware and
calls a rom ;) What is there ? Runtime loadable microcode ? Specially
optimized code for sending data to 2 pipes on a GeForce2 and 8 on a 6800 ?
Who knows. But sure the driver does _many_ things.
