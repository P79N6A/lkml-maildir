I'm hoping you agree with that abbreviated summary of
what's involved!  Pavel seemed to.  Of course the devil is
in the details, which I hope to leave mostly to others ... ;)

The machines I've tested with relatively generic 2.6.9-rc kernels
don't use BIOS support for S4 when I call swsusp.
Of course the ACPI spec muddies the water by talking about two
different states called "S4":  "S4 Sleeping", which is what I was
talking about as G1/S4; and "S4 Non-Volatile Sleep" that's more
what I've seen with swusp:  more like a G2 or G3 poweroff.
I'm willing to believe that there are systems on which swsusp
tells drivers a less confusing story ... but I don't seem to have
tested with those!
