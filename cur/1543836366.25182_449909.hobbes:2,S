I think thats why he's wrong.
The interface for a hypedvisor is
      Kernel -> Something -> Hypedvisor
The kernel->something interface can change randomly by day of week, who
cares. A better analogy would be a device driver - we recompile device
drivers each kernel variant, which change their internal interfaces, we 
redesign their locking but we don't have to change the hardware.
Ditto talking to the hypedvisor. The ABI is the hypedvisor syscall/trap
interface not the kernel module interface. As such insmod is just fine.
