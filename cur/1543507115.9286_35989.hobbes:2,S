Why do you need two registers for the sum or two scratch registers? I
haven't looked at the instruction set since the first MMX chips came out
but I seem to remember you could do:
64 bit read to reg0
Unpack lower words of reg0 to 32-bit values in reg1
Add reg1 to reg2
Unpack upper reg0 to reg1
Add reg1 to reg2
If that doesn't pipeline well, or if you get a benefit out of doing two
sets of 8 words in parallel, there are a number of ways to shuffle things
around.
