BUILD_BUG_ON is a different thing. the "condition" is meant to be
evaluated at _compile_ time, not at runtime (so the unlikely is useless
since the compiler knows the result before it generates the bytecode).
This is why BUILD_BUG() isn't implemented anywhere, so you get a linker
error during the compilation.
For example with it you can do things like:
	BUILD_BUG_ON(offsetof(struct task_struct, thread.i387.fxsave) & 15);
(see asm-i386/bugs.h, it's doing the BUILD_BUG_ON by hand right now)
