ifeq ($(MAKECMDGOALS),$(obj)/gkc)
        gkc-objs        := kconfig_load.o
        gkc-cxxobjs     := gconf.o
endif
In this part you tell kbuild that gconf.o is made from a .cc file
[implying C++] and g++ will be used.
If your gconf.cc really is a C-file (looks like it) then you only
need one line:
gkc-objs := gconf.o kconfig_load.o
But then you need to rename gconf.cc to gconf.c as well.
I tried to apply your patch, but it failed because I did
not have 'pkg-config'. I guess I need some GTK developer kit?
