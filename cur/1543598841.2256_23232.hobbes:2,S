The problem is that the on-disk metadata now says that that disk block 
is part of the file. So as the page is not up-to-date, the next read 
operation will go to the disk and fetch that block of garbage into the 
page cache.

No difference, as the write is to a hole in the middle of the file, and 
doesn't change i_size.

The heart of it is this:
fd = open(file, O_CREAT | O_TRUNC | O_RDWR, S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR);
lseek(fd, 16385, SEEK_SET);
write(fd, "x", 1);
lseek(fd, 12345, SEEK_SET);
write(fd, "y", 1);
	
During the final write, I intervene with gdb to force the 
__copy_from_user() to fail. It should be possible to do something 
similar with a multi-threaded application where another thread modifies 
the VM, but I haven't actually built a real example.
Then I just take a look at the file with od.
