The vfat file system lowercases all file names without long Unicode part,
e.g. created under DOS. If we create a file or directory with Linux vfat,
the name will uppercased and no long part will created if lenghth and
charset is conform to DOS rules. This seems me to be the reason for
described behaviour. In my patch for short name translation it is simple
to change this behaviour for creating always the long part of file names
with unchanged case of chars.
Best regards,
