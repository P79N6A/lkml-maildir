Hi Jeff,
I'm submitting three more patches for inclusion in netdev#upstream.
These patches are built over the series I resent yesterday night.
The patch numbering reflects the stacking.
Here is a brief description:
-   avoid false positives in the xgmac hang workaround
-   Properly set the CQ_ERR bit in RDMA CQ contexts.
-   Update CQ context operations time out values
Cheers,
Divy
