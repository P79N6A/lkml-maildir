Good day,
Please CC me, since I'm not subscribed. 
I just tried to compile 2.6.8-rc2-mm1 and got this error:
drivers/built-in.o(.text+0x7e369): In function `rivafb_probe'::
undefined reference to `riva_create_i2c_busses'
drivers/built-in.o(.text+0x7e4c1): In function `rivafb_probe'::
undefined reference to `riva_delete_i2c_busses'
drivers/built-in.o(.exit.text+0x1ca): In function `rivafb_remove'::
undefined reference to `riva_delete_i2c_busses'
make: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
Config attached. BTW why can't I disable SCSI support in menuconfig? I 
don't really need it.
Thanks,
Grega
