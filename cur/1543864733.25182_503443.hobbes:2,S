Wrinting a driver for shiny new hardware is cool.
But understanding and maintaining an already existing driver and working 
on bug reports for this driver is something not-so-cool that would be 
required in many areas of the kernel.
Would someone from your long list of people e.g. be willing to maintain 
drivers/block/floppy.c ?
