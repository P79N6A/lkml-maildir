Alas this would simply make it more difficult for me to update things.
For example I update Documentation/networking/8139too.txt each time
there is a corresponding update to drivers/net/8139too.c.  Having to go
from current situation to patching two totally separate trees would be a
PITA and regression from current workflow.
