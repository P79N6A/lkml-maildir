Err, this definitely breaks X on alpha. On small and mid-range
machines we always have pci_domain_nr(bus) == bus->number.
Practically, it's only Marvel where we could overflow an 8-bit
bus number.

Looks good to me, except this (see above):

How about this instead?
	/* Backwards compatibility for first N PCI domains. */
	if (pci_domain_nr(dev->bus) > PCI_PROC_MAX_DOMAIN)
		return 0;
PCI_PROC_MAX_DOMAIN could be defined in asm/pci.h (255 on alpha), default 0.
