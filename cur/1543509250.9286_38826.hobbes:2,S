If you're seeing THIS kind of errors, it SURE looks like a hardware
issue. If the software is making errors, I'd expect a random byte
inserted somewhere. A block of data shifted one byte. A whole block
corrupted (delivered to the wrong address in memory). Things like
that.
If it's usually "bit 3" that's wrong, it seems that a cable is too
long according to spec, a timing issue on the card etc. etc. Something
like that. Not a software error.
To me that "diff" shows too much correlation between the differing
values. These are NOT random bytes dropped onto the good data by a
wild pointer or something like that.
