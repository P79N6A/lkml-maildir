You can always do this in the hardware - no reason to do it in software.
If you are using RAID 5, and you wanted to take the performance hit you
could always calculate the checksums for each stripe on read to detect
errors.  You may even be able to add a second parity disk to do ECC on
the disk data.
As for online resizing, you can do this with ext2 for a long time with
my ext2online patches/tools.  LVM lets you migrate between disks online.
You need hardware support (available) to do hot-swap disks - SCSI works,
but I don't think the IDE code is ready for hot-swap yet.
Cheers, Andreas
