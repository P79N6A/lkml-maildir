Well, maybe the hotfix patch converts all the uses of 'if BLOCK' to
'if CONFIG_BLOCK', but I still think that 'if USE_BLOCK_DEVS' would be
more clear.  It's not like it should be all *that* used outside of
config stuff.
Oh well, thanks for your reply, now I can test 2.6.18-rc5-mm1 and see
if my IRQ problem is really there or not.
