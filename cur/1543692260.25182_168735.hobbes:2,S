According to 
http://www.linuxworld.com/story/33804.htm,
 (Andrew Miklas), 
the BCM4301 is supported however I don't see any such critter in my source.
I find numerous mentions on the web about the v2.7 model of this bugger 
having switched to the BCM chip instead of the Prism chip.
Is there really any [kernel 2.6] support for this thing somewhere or do 
I have to email LinkSys a nastygram? :)
