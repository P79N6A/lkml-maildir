Yes, but if this will be in the Kconfig as well (I mean adding "default y"
lines, I can make a patch, if there's a desire), it will be offered as default
even when doing make oldconfig, which is what most of the people is going to do
(not make defconfig, most of people doesn't even know it exists and the rest
probably wants to configure 2.5 based on their 2.4 configuration anyway).
