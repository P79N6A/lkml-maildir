Please try the patch below.

Yes, this is expected.

It is marked experimental, so it is not in the "kernel for the
masses". Also, Configure.help has a clear warning about the state of
this code. If somebody asks for experimental code, and ignores the
warning, they should know how to recover from data loss.

This sounds serious. Could you please add -DDEBUG to ntfs/Makefile,
and then do
echo 4095 >/proc/sys/fs/ntfs-debug
When mounting, this will produce a lot of output. I'd be interested in
some of it :-)
