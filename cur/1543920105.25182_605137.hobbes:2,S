This really needs to be fixed...
I can't make up my mind between the approaches to fixing it.
On one hand, I would actually prefer to really mark the buffers
dirty (as in: Eric's fix for this problem[*]) than this patch,
and this seems a bit like a bandaid...
On the other hand, the wound being covered by the bandaid is
actually the code in the buffer layer that does this latent
"cleaning" of the page because it sadly doesn't really keep
track of the pagecache state. But it *still* feels like we
should be marking the rd page's buffers dirty which should
avoid this problem anyway.
[*] However, hmm, with Eric's patch I guess we'd still have a hole
where filesystems that write their buffers by hand think they are
"cleaning" these things and we're back to square one. That could
be fixed by marking the buffers dirty again?
Why were Eric's patches dropped, BTW? I don't remember.
