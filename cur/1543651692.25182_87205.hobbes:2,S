Looking over the recent changes in Linus' tree, I saw there was this
new file, include/linux/flat.h.  Hmmm, uninformative name, what's this
file about?  I look in the file and here is how it starts:
/* Copyright (C) 1998  Kenneth Albanowski <kjahds@kjahds.com>
 *                     The Silver Hammer Group, Ltd.
 * Copyright (C) 2002  David McCullough <davidm@snapgear.com>
 */
#ifndef _LINUX_FLAT_H
#define _LINUX_FLAT_H
#define	FLAT_VERSION			0x00000004L
/*
 * To make everything easier to port and manage cross platform
 * development,  all fields are in network byte order.
 */
struct flat_hdr {
	char magic[4];
	unsigned long rev;          /* version (as above) */
etc.
*Completely* uninformative.  How is anyone supposed to know what this
relates to?  Is it something to do with a network device, or a
filesystem, or an executable format, or what?
[And no, don't reply to this telling me what it's about, add some
comments to the file instead.]
Paul.
