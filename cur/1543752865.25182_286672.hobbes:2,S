I disagree.  First of all, we can't know what motivates someone, and
presuming that we know their motivation is something that should only
be done with the greatest of care.  Secondly, someone who does want
cheap PR can do so without delaying their disclosure; they can issue a
breathless press release or "security advisory" about a DOS attack
just easily with a zero-day disclosure as they can with a two-week
delayed disclosure.
Sure, there are less-than-savory security firms that are only after PR
to drive business.  But that's completely orthogonal to whether or not
the disclosure is delayed or not.  Yes, "glorification" of relatively
trivial bugs is a problem; but whether or not the bugs are delayed
doesn't change whether someone issues an "iOFFENSE SECURITY ADVISORY"
which overstates the bug; it only changes whether they send the
advisory right away or a week or two later.  (After all, the security
groups that subscribe to a zero-day "full disclosure" policy use
advisory/press releases glorifies their findings just as much.)

A one or two week delay is hardly cause for "a news organization to
make a big stick so vendors will take notice".  Besides, which is it?
Are it about security researchers that are after cheap PR, or "news
organizations forcing vendors to take notice"?  Certainly I've never
that kind of dynamic with Linux vendors where reporters are trying to
get vendors to take notice; it doesn't matter whether take notice if
they are going to be releasing in two weeks later come hell or high
water.

Here, we certainly agree.

Nah.  If you have criminal intent, generally there are far easier ways
to target a specific company.  For example, many companies that have
multiple layers of firewalls, intrusion detection systems, etc., will
keep critical financial information in boxes left unlocked in the
hallways, and not bother to do any kind of background checks before
hiring temporary employees/contractors.  Sad but true.
I'm quite certain that far more economic damage is being done by
script kiddies and by "insiders" using officially granted privileges
to access financial applications than by the hypothetical Dr. Evil
that hires computer experts to find vulnerabilities that could be used
to cary out criminal intent.  And it's the script kiddies that we can
prevent by delaying disclosures by only a week or two, to give a
chance to get the fixes out to the people who need them.
