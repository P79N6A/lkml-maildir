It's whole 20kb to download... Not a big deal, IMO.
Yes, _taht_ part of the discussion is plainly ridiculous.

It might not affect the executing code, but it certainly affects the source
(#ifdef THIS_OR_THAT), and also impacts the design (even when disabled, the
rest of the code must anticipate it being enabled), and complicates testing
and debugging (instead of one version of the code you need to check three:
With, as module, and without).
