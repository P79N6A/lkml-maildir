I am running into an intermittent problem with core dumping when cedega 
crashes.  I've traced it down to it deadlocking on the 
wait_for_completion(&startup_done) in fs/exec.c:coredump_wait().  If I 
try to kill the process, it goes into zombie status and takes up 50% cpu 
until I reboot.  The kernel is 2.6.12-rc3 UP on x86_64.  Cedega is a 
32-bit app.  Any help with debugging this would be appreciated.
