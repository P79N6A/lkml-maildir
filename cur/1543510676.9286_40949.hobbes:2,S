Doing a bootup with scsi dev I know that I can get infos from
/proc/scsi. These infos are readable. ok. But having a scsi dev giving
me parameters back I want to modify, for the kernel, where are they
stored, if they are?
Real: an INQUIRY on a MO gives me back RMB not set, -> not removable. In
reality this drive is rm, is there a possibility to tell the kernel to
behave like a removable?
Is there an entry in /proc? And if can I modify it?
Thanks
Andreas  
ALSO, if this is a Q for SCSI tell me ..
