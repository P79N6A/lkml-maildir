Quick status on this.
I have submitted a corrected patch containing only the
HAVE_IDE stuff via kbuild.git and considering the
comment from David the mtd bits are trivial done.
So I expect someone that better can check the arm stuff
to do the final conversion bits to introduce drivers/Kconfig
when kbuild.git hits mainline.
