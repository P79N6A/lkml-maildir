Sometime ago with a personal thread with Linus, he says to me that the
functions put_user and get_user should never be used, except when you know
what really are you doing, these functions doesn't have a range check and
you need to use a verify_area() before. So use the new 2.2.x
copy_from_user and copy_to_user, examples of utilization can be found at
