I don't think you have any other users (other than signals)  that wake up
processes that aren't on some wait-queue.
And by the time we exit, we have better had removed outselves from all the
wait-queues, so I suspect signals are really the only thing that can wake
up a process after it died but before it's truly gone.
Anyway, I'll code up the SIGKILL changes that should make this a non-issue 
(along with the bad SIGKILL/kernel-thread interaction).
