This looks like it sees a 256MB module in socket DIMM3

Socket DIMM0 says nothing is installed.

Socket DIMM1 says nothing is installed.

Socket DIMM2 says nothing is installed.

This would appear to say that socket DIMM3 has a 256MB DIMM of type DDR
at 133MHZ, which would be 266MHz effective.  Odd given the x206 data
sheet I found only mentions 333 and 400MHz as supported.  Maybe the DMI
data is wrong, or maybe the memory in the system isn't right.
I think the only way to know for sure what type of ram a machine takes
is to read the manual, or maybe ask www.crucial.com (I have seen it have
information that was correct while an IBM manual for the machine was
wrong on the amount of ram a machine could take).
Crucial's information says the system has 4 DIMM slots for DDR memory,
and should use either PC2700 or PC3200 memory.
