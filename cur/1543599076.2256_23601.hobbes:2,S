Hmm... on receiving it is enough trivial and we do this.

A lot? Even ne2000 had 16K of memory, which is enough to do this. 
It is the first.
Card need not hold fragments, it may send fragments in backward order.
It is the second.
Well, and the last but not the least: acenic has exactly this amount
of memory: "lots" :-) It is the third. :-)

acenic. We do not use this, though this is also not difficult.
