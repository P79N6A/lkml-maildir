We have at least one example where we have a single PCI function
containing more than one type of functionality which are the parallel
port and serial cards [*].  Normally, the different types of
functionality are accessible via different BARs which at least gives
some logical separation.
It's not really a good model because you have to have a special PCI
probe driver to register the various functionalities with the subsystems
rather than using the generic 8250_pci and parport_pci drivers directly.
Also it can have problems if you want to have (eg) serial built-in and
i2c as a module.
The alternative as Greg points out is to implement a pseudo bus_type, but
I start to worry about the overhead associated with doing so.
Given the choice between a small PCI "probe" driver for a small number
of functionalities and a complete driver model infrastructure, I'd
prefer the former over the latter.
* - I'm slightly biased here because it seems I've ended up "owning" the
    serial parts of parport_serial, though I don't want to admit that in
    public.  (damn, I just did!)  I think that, provided the subsystems
    are sanely written such that there is very little or no code
    duplication, this method is as good as any other method.
