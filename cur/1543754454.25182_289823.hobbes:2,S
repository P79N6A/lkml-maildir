I'm not talking about bugs, I'm talking about mitigation of unknown bugs.
You have to remember that I think mostly in terms of proactive security.
 If there's a buffer overflow, temp file race condition, code injection
or ret2libc in a userspace program, it can be stopped.  this narrows
down what exploits an attacker can actually use.
This puts pressure on the attacker; he has to find a bug, write an
exploit, and find an opportunity to use it before a patch is written and
applied to fix the exploit.  If say 80% of exploits are suddenly
non-exploitable, then he's left with mostly very short windows that are
far and few, and thus may be beyond his level of UNION(task->skill,
task->luck) in many cases.
Thus, by having fewer exploits available, fewer successful attacks
should happen due to the laws of probability.  So the goal becomes to
fix as many bugs as possible, but also to mitigate the ones we don't
know about.  To truly mitigate any security flaw, we must make a
non-circumventable protection.
If you can circumvent protection A by simply using attack B* to disable
protection A to do more interesting attack A*, then protection A is
smoke and mirrors.  If you have protection B that stops B*, but can be
circumvented by A*, then deploying A and B will reciprocate and prevent
both A* and B*, creating a protection scheme that can't be circumvented.
In this context, it doesn't make sense to deploy a protection A or B
without the companion protection, which is what I meant.  You're
thinking of fixing specific bugs; this is good and very important (as
effective proactive security BREAKS things that are buggy), but there is
a better way to create a more secure environment.  Fixing the bugs
increases the quality of the product, while adding protections makes
them durable enough to withstand attacks targetting their own flaws.
