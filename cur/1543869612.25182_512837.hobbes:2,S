Well, my concerns about the design have gone.  There remain some
concerns about the source code and I hope they will disappear just as
fast. :)
Obviously, a patch against 2.4.x is fairly useless.  Iirc, you claimed
somewhere to have a patch against 2.6.11, but I was unable to find that.
Porting 2.6.11 to 2.6.20 should be simple enough.
Then there is some assembly code inside the patch that you seem to have
copied from some other project.  I would be surprised if that is really
required.  If you can replace it with C code, please do.
If the assembly actually is a performance gain (and I consider it your
duty to prove that), you can have a two-patch series with the first
introducing DualFS and the second adding the assembly as a config option
for one architecture.

Last time I tried it was only available to members.  Is it generally
available now?
