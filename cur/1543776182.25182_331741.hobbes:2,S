You can try opening corresponding event device (/dev/input/eventX),
grabbing it so nobody except for your process would get any events
from the corresponding keyboard (EVIOCGRAB ioctl), and then read
events, mangle them and inject them back into kernel through uinput
driver.
As an additional plus it should work for any keyboard (or rather any
input device), not only PS/2 keyboard.
