On Alpha, Sun and other hardware, "halt" puts you into the firmware
monitor. It doesn't actually turn the machine off, so it's not
critical to flush the write cache of the disk - the only time
that is really neccesary is right before poweroff, in all other
cases the disk will expire the write cache itself.
