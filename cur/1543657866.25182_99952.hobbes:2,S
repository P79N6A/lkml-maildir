There are some bus dependencies for network drivers that you omitted,
either on purpose or by accident. The patch below adds these
dependencies, which is required for compiling with allyesconfig
on s390 and perhaps other architectures.
The dependencies are taken either from reading the source of
searching the web, so there is a chance that there are mistakes.
