Worked here on a PCI-X AMD-8131 based system.
----
Offtopic, something I wanted to bring up with respect to MSI,
but never had the time to debug:
If I do
pci_enable_msix, pci_disable_msix
then later
pci_enable_msi
on the same device fails with the following message:
PCI: 0000:08:00.0: Can't enable MSI.  Device already has MSI-X vectors assigned
This is not something new - has been happening since forever.
Looks like not all MSI-X vectors get properly unassigned by pci_disable_msix.
One way to test this is by loading mthca driver with msi_x=1, unloading
and loading with msi=1.
Someone has any idea what's wrong?
