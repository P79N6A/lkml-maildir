Well, it's hit /. and OSNews already this morning.
Mainstream media is now aware of Linux; for better or worse, someday, an 
issue like this is going to leak beyond Slashdot onto the pages of the 
Wall Street Journal and ZDNet. Maybe not this time -- but eventually.
Open development is the ultimate in honesty -- and honesty leaves us 
vulnerable to being bitten by the ignorati and anti-freedom forces.
