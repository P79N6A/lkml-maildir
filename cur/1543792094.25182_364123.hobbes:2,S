Good point, it may not be as disastrous as I was imagining.  Certainly
deadlocky in copy_page_range and mremap move at present, but that can
be easily surmounted.  However, there is the slab lru issue too: if it's
convenient for an arch to use slab cache, I'd prefer not to make life
difficult for them.  I'll come back to this but not tonight.
