hr_msleep makes no sense. Why should we tie this interface to millisecond 
resolution?
Your suggested msleep_approx makes not much sense to me either, since 
neither interface guarantees anything and may "approximate" the sleep 
(and if the user is surprised by that something else already went wrong).
If you don't like the hrsleep name, we can also call it nanosleep and so 
match what we already do for userspace.
