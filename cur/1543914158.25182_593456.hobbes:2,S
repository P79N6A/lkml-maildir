Question, can you change (shrink) the limit on a BDI while it has IO
in flight?  And what will that do to the system?  I.e. if you have one
device doing IO, so that it has a majority of the dirty limit.  Then
another device starts IO, and it's a *faster* device, how
quickly/slowly does the BDI dirty limits change for both the old and
new device?

Does a slower device get a BDI which is calculated to keep it's limit
under a certain number of seconds of outstanding IO?  This way no
device can build up more than say 15 seconds of outstanding IO to
flush at any one time.  
Thanks!
