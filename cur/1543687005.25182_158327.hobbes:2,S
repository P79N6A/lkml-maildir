Cool!  Hey, is this just an exercise, or are we actually going to use 
this?  I would be very happy to have something I contributed to put into 
the kernel.  :)

Good idea... bad to do so many checks if count is zero.  On the other 
hand, if count is rarely zero, then it's a loss.  Maybe benchmark with 
and without?

I know that a good compiler should migrate code to help the CPU 
pipeline, but how about moving this "count2 = " line up to before the 
first fill loop.  See if that helps any.  Always good to precompute well 
in advance.

And move this to before the middle fill loop.
