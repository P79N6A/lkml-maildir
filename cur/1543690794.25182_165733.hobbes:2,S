Dear sir,
  I used Linux RedHat 7.2. My kernel is 2.4.7-10smp.
I want to modify file below to make new kernel.
    /usr/src/linux/drivers/scsi/st_options.h
  But don"t have "st_optioms.h" in my system.
  Please let me know how to solve this problem.
          Thank you very much.
              regards,
              Somsak.
