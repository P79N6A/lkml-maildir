This matches the "if IRQ is disabled for whatever reason" test in irq.c, 
and as such it makes some amount of sense. However, from a logical 
standpoint it is indeed not very sensible. It's hard to see why the code 
does what it does.

This should not happen: the first one will shut up the interrupt. That's 
in fact what (a) does - it refuses to enable the interrupt again (and it 
will have been shut up by the "ack".
(Other interrupt controllers _can_ get multiple interrupts while disabled, 
like the APIC edge-triggered case. But they have different logic to take 
care of this - see io_apic.c and the logic there in the 
[ack|end]_edge_ioapic_irq).
In short, this is all behaviour that depends on the low-level irq 
controller. It may not be very obvious what is going on, but I think it is 
correct (and again, it might be worth cleaning up some day. Not now)

Yes. It was actually tried a few months ago, but some of the other 
architectures have very different interrupt setups, so it got dropped. But 
it will almost certainly happen eventually: we've had bugs fixed on x86 
that ended up living a lot longer on other architectures.
