I am not sure why.

samba 2.2 uses tdb which is an SMP safe gdbm like database. By default it
uses byte range fcntl locks to provide locking, but has the option of
using spinlocks (./configure --with-spinlocks). I doubt it would make
a difference on your setup.

I havent done any testing on slow hardware and the high end stuff is
definitely performing better in 2.4, but I agree we shouldn't forget
about the slower stuff.
Narrowing down where the problem is would help. My guess is it is a TCP
problem, can you check if it is performing worse in your case? (eg ftp
something against 2.2 and 2.4)
