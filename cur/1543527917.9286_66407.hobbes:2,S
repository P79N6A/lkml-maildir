Subject: es1371 and soundcard.h--where does it go?

I'm sure this is just a matter of semantics, but <linux/soundcard.h>,
along with (presumably) <linux/types.h>, <linux/string.h>, and
<asm/uaccess.h> were (mistakenly, I'm sure) left out of the appropriate
files.  Are they supposed to be included in ac97_codec.h, or in
ac97_codec.c?
Please CC replies to me AWAT the list.
Thanks, now I go search for answer to the inode.c compile problem with
the usbdevfs stuff.
