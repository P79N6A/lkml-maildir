That's what I hate about all of this, just think how much stack that
kmalloc can take in low memory situations.... it might end up in
writepage on another nfs file.... Moving stuff off the stack and
into kmalloc just reduces the possibility of stack overflow, it
does not fix the problem. Having memory reclaim take place inside
the thread which is waiting for memory makes that a pretty hard
problem to fix.
