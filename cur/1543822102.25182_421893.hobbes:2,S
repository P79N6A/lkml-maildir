They did not or at least to a much lesser extent. That's the reason why
ZenIV.linux.org.uk had a mail DoS during the last FC release and why we
see load average questions on lkml.
I've seen it on our servers as well: when using 2.4 and doing 50 MB/s
to disk (through NFS), the load just was slightly above 0. When we
switched the servers to 2.6 it went to ~16 for the same disk usage.
