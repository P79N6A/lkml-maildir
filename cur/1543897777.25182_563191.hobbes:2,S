But MAP_NOZERO adds a new possible information leak from root out to the
non-root user.  If root does
    setuid(newuid);
    exec(...);
    exit(1);
and there are MAP_NOZERO pages which contain sensitive information,
a process running as newuid would be able to race the exec with
PTRACE_ATTACH and extract the sensitive information.  Without MAP_NOZERO
the information leak is limited to information which was in the setuid
program's address space (and presumably, setuid programs are written to
be careful about such things).
That said, I think I like the idea of MAP_NOZERO.  Could it be
generalized to some kind of "free pool" rather than keyed off of uid?
