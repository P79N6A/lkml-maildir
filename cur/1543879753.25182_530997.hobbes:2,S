Could you try xine-ui or gxine? Because I suspect rather xine-lib for
freezing issues. In any way I think a gdb backtrace would be much
nicer - but if you can't reproduce the freeze issue with other xine
based players and want to run kaffeine in gdb, you need to execute
"gdb --args kaffeine --nofork".
