Trying to save power consumption. I have a backup drive that is used 
only once a day to back up the main drive. So - why should I run it more 
that 10 minutes a day? What I'd like to do is keep it in an off state 
and then at night power it on, mount it up, do the backup, unmount it, 
and shut it down. Can I do that?
