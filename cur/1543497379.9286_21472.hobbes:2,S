If I remember correctly, I "fixed" this a few months ago in my tree, but had
since lost the patch in a nasty HD crash (burn, actually). If that's indeed
what I fixed, I eventually decided not to send it to the official tree,
because I figured 'cat something.wav > /dev/dsp' isn't the proper way to
play a sound file anyhow, and proper sound players are capable of stopping
the sound immediately (they have a system call to do that).
Maybe this is a non-issue, hence. When I get some time, I'll take a look
again.
