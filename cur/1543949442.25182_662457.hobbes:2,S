Hi,
While reading through the iSER code I noticed two rather nasty issues:
1. The iteration through the list of "iser_device"s during device
lookup/creation is broken - it might result in an infinite loop if more
than 1 HCA is used with iSER. Use list_for_each_entry() instead of the
custom, flawed list iteration code.
2. "iser_device" allocation failure is "handled" with a BUG_ON() right
before dereferencing the NULL-pointer.
This is really scary, so here's my idea of a fix. Someone with a deeper
understanding of the code should have a look at it since I'm not sure it
does The Right Thing.
Both patches are merely compile tested, and patch #2 needs to be applied
on top of #1.
Cheers,
Arne
