OSDL has released a new version of the Scalable Test Platform, an
automated test environment that allows a developer to test kernel
patches on a variety of hardware platforms against a number of
performance tests. 
The code and documentation is at:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/stp/
OSDL's instance of STP is at:
http://www.osdl.org/stp.
Types of tests to exercise a kernel patch include:
    * memory stress 
    * scheduler
    * file system
    * database
    * system calls
    * synthetic microbenchmarks
Changes to the new release include the following:
    * New installation toolkit
    * Major revision to backend
    * Minor bug fixes to web interface
    * Much new documentation on Web and in kit
We encourage the community to use the framework at OSDL to test your
patches.  Become an OSDL associate (free signup) at www.osdl.org
and take advantage of the the various platforms offered in the lab.
