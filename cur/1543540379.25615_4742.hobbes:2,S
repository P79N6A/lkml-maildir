This may not be a good idea. Try 2.2.15 or 2.2.16. These are not
development kernels and they do work.
PCI is PCI. Intel was one of those that wrote the rules. It is unlikely
that they would market a bad chip. However, check to see what your
BIOS is doing. If a 33 MHz PCI bus has been set to 66 MHz, all bets
are off.
Also, some BIOS fail to set shared memory correctly on some PCI devices.
For instance, if you have a PCI screen-card with 4 Mb of shared memory, it
must be placed on a 4 Mb boundary. That's the rules. Attempts to access
such devices, that are not properly aligned, will produce address aliases.
This means that when the device-driver accesses its shared RAM, it may
write over important kernel stuff.
If you BIOS is mucking up, there may be an upgrade available since
these things are discovered fairly quickly.
