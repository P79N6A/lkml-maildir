EAAKK!  WARNING:  A message that started like this appears to be
from Linus but it is MY twisted opinions - not his!  (Well, he can
use it if he wants but that wasn't the point!)
Between extracting and editing a digest reply, and my local corporate
mailer configuration, it appears that I can easily forge the "From"
address - not my intent at all.
Please accept my apologies for the typo which was NOT intended to be
a forgery.

	ever have I been a Linus!)
