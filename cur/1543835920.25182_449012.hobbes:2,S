Hi,
One strange behaviour that comes to mind is the following:
1. I boot my machine so that it doesn't load module X
2. I modify /etc/sysctl.conf and I remove a line affecting module X
3. I modprobe X
Wouldn't the fact that the sysctl directive is applied anyway be a bit 
misleading?
Regards,
Frederik
