EBDA is safe to use during lilo and grub as part of a BIOS. As long as
the EBDA is properly formed.
However, it is considered 'bad behavior' to allocate much more than 4k
of EBDA as we find others (not Linux) that depend on the 640K region of
memory run out of this precious resource. Beware of several add-in
BIOSii that each allocate EBDA; nest/size/relocate/offset properly.

Subject: EBDA Question
EBDA - Extended Bios Data Area
Does Linux and various boot loaders(lilo/grub/etc)
having any restrictions on where and how big 
memory allocated in EBDA is? Is this
handled for 2.4/2.6 Kernels?
Reason I ask is we are considering having
BIOS(for a SCSI HBA Controller) allocating
memory in EBDA for Firmware use. 
We are concerned whether Linux would be writing
over this region of memory during the handoff
of BIOS to scsi lower layer driver loading.
