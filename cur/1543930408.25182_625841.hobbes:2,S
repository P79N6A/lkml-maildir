Hi!
> This patch implements the functionality of jumping between the kexeced
> kernel and the original kernel.
> 
> To support jumping between two kernels, before jumping to (executing)
> the new kernel and jumping back to the original kernel, the devices
> are put into quiescent state, and the state of devices and CPU is
> saved. After jumping back from kexeced kernel and jumping to the new
> kernel, the state of devices and CPU are restored accordingly. The
> devices/CPU state save/restore code of software suspend is called to
> implement corresponding function.

> (destination page). When do kexec_load, the image of new kernel is

I'm not kexec hacker... but maybe this is in good enough state to be
merged? It is useful on its own: kexec jump and back means we can dump
system then continue running, for example...
