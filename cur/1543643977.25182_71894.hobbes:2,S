Thanks for the quick response. We are working on a new HW layout. I think
that I already got the answer to the critical question that I need. Once I
have the HW in place, I have to be sure that the 2.4.18-3 Kernel (or
greater) can support hot swap withoout any third party SW. Of course I
understand that my driver will have to be modified. This answer I already
received yesterday. Thanks very much.

From looking at the datasheet of the AMCC S5935, it appears to not be
compliant with the PICMG 2.1 cPCI hotswap specification.  That means
that it will probably take quite a bit of hardware and software hacking
to make insertion work.  My patches should provide a bit of basis for
further hacking if you do want to try and build something yourself, but
if reliable hotplugging is important to your project, I'd suggest
considering a switch to a PCI controller or bridge that is PICMG 2.1
hotswap compliant.
