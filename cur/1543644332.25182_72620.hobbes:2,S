To summarize: You find tracing useful, but software tracing is only of
limited value in areas you're working at.
What about other developers, which only want to develop a simple driver,
without having to understand the whole kernel? Traces still work where
printk() or kgdb don't work. I think it's reasonable to ask an user to
enable tracing and reproduce the problem, which you can't reproduce
yourself.

Last time I checked it has no impact on the kernel as long as it's not
enabled. Anyway, it would already be very useful to have at least the core
integrated. How many drivers currently define a "dprint"? Some even
implement its own tracing. While debug prints are mostly useful during
early development, they are usually completely useless, when you have to
reproduce a problem.

While I agree that this acceptable approach for things like kgdb, I think
it would very useful to have at least the tracing core in the kernel.
