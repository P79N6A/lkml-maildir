Interesting idea. What do you mean by an extra protocol exactly? An extra
IPPROTO_xxxx option as might be passed to socket()?
My RxRPC implementation currently does all the incoming message management and
routing in process context in a worker thread.
The following details have to be resolved wherever it is done:
 (*) RxRPC calls (operations) may be aborted or rejected.
 (*) RxRPC packets have to be ACK'd/NAK'd and maybe resent. ACK packets may
     ACK or NAK multiple data packets.
 (*) RxRPC packets have their own "connection number" and "channel number" and
     "call number" spaces on top UDP port numbers, thus require multi-tier
     routing.
 (*) An operation (a "call") may get challenged or may be challenged for
     security details in the middle of transmission or reception.
 (*) RxRPC packets may get merged together and placed into one UDP
     packet. They then have to be split and processed individually upon
     reception.
I don't see that there should be a problem with the first three (after all,
TCP does all of them). The fourth may be the trickiest, but that may also be
the one NFSv4 has to deal with.

It's not entirely clear as to how to use it.

That's useful. I also pass pages to my rxrpc receive data routine to copy into
directly from skbuffs, but I don't see that being a problem.
