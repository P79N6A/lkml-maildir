There's a subtle difference: For malloc(), libc has a mutex (or
whatever), but for open(), socket() etc., no locking is performed, and
many libc functions create (and destroy) descriptors imlicitely.  
I still don't see how you can write maintainable and reliable software
with asynchronous close().  For example, if some select() call returns
EBADF after an asynchronous close(), you would have to scan the
descriptors to find the offending one, but in the meantime, it has
been reused by another thread.  What do you do in this case?
