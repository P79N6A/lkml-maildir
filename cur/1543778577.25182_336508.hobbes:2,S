Subject: [RFC] Races in aio call back path.

Hi all,
I found some races in the AIO call back path which is the root cause for
a few problems in the AIO code. The race is between the aio call back
path ( executed by softirqs ) and the aio_run_iocb().
(1) Suppose a retry returned -EIOCBRETRY and wait has been queued.
Now, whenever the wait event has been completed, the aio_wake_function()
is invoked by the softirqs. aio_wake_function deletes the wait entry
(iocb->ki_wait.task_list) and invokes kick_iocb() to kick the iocb and
queue it back to the run_list.
Consider a situation like:
SOFTIRQ:
	list_del_init(&wait->task_list);
           ## SOFTIRQ gets scheduled or PROCESS executes on another CPU ##
	kick_iocb(iocb);
PROCESS:
	/*
	 * Issue an additional retry to avoid waiting forever if
	 * no waits were queued (e.g. in case of a short read).
	 */
	if (list_empty(&iocb->ki_wait.task_list))
	kiocbSetKicked(iocb);
So, PROCESS might see the deleted(empty) wait list
(iocb->ki_wait.task_list) and will kick and queue it up and it will be
retried again. Now if the next retry is going to happen before SOFTIRQ
gets a chance to run, we are running into problems.
There are two possiblities:
(a) The iocb may get completed.
	If this happens before the SOFTIRQ enters kick_iocb(iocb), we are about
to kick an iocb which is no more valid. This might cause a Kernel Oops
while trying,
	spin_lock_irqsave(&ctx->ctx_lock, flags);
since the iocb->ki_ctx may be invalid.
(b) The iocb might encounter another wait condition.
	This case iocb would be queued for some events. This would cause the
SOFTIRQ hit
	WARN_ON((!list_empty(&iocb->ki_wait.task_list)));
in queue_kicked_iocb().
(2) Similar races occur due to Kicking the iocb.
i.e,
SOFTIRQ: [in kick_iocb()]
		if(!kiocbTryKick(iocb)) {
	# If we get scheduled here. And PROCESS reaches as below #
			queue_kicked_iocb(iocb);
PROCESS: [ in aio_run_iocb() ]
		/* will make __queue_kicked_iocb succeed from here on */
		INIT_LIST_HEAD(&iocb->ki_run_list);
		/* we must queue the next iteration ourselves, if it
		 * has already been kicked */
		if (kiocbIsKicked(iocb)) { <- Will be true see ( kicked by kick_iocb)
			__queue_kicked_iocb(iocb);
		}
Thus iocb will get queued and may be retried. This again can cause the
problems described above.
Conclusion
===========
  From this I conclude that the following operations in call back path
for async iocbs should be atomic.
(*) Deletion of the wait queue entry.
(*) Kicking the iocb.
(*) Queue back to run_list. ( which is already atomic with ctx_lock held ).
Also the check for waits being queued in aio_run_iocb() should be done
with the ctx_lock held.
Solution
========
I have created a patch which makes above operations to be done with the
iocb->ki_ctx->ctx_lock held. Also, I have moved the check :
   > if (list_empty(&iocb->ki_wait.task_list))
   >	kiocbSetKicked(iocb);
to be done under the ctx_lock held.
Since we already holds a lock before calling queue_kicked_iocb(), there
is no need for a queue_kicked_iocb anymore. So I have renamed the
__queue_kicked_iocb to queue_kicked_iocb.
Testing
========
I tested the proposed patch in 2.6.13-rc3-mm1 on a 2-way Intel Xeon(with HT) with aio-stress and fsx-linux test cases.
The tests ran fine.
Comments ?
