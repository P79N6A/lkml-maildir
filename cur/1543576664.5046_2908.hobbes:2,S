Yes, this should be competely legal and wanted. Some programs use
shmget (..,0,..) to test if the segment is there. Apparently Xine does
this while setting the IPC_CREATE flag. This is legal on 2.4 (wasn't
in 2.2) and gives you a 0 byte segment.
shmat will give you then the legal address 0 like mmap would.
