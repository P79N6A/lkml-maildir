After compiling and linking my .so with the -shared option,
I've inspected strace output.
I can clearly see that the shared object (which is 2MB size) is NOT being
shared:
1395  open("/usr/local/sharedclient.so", O_RDONLY) = 6
1395  read(6, "\177ELF\1\1\1\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\3\0\3\0\1\0\0\0\340\200"...,
1024) = 1024
1395  fstat64(6, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=2079700, ...}) = 0
1395  old_mmap(NULL, 2118824, PROT_READ|PROT_EXEC, MAP_PRIVATE, 6, 0) =
0x401ea000
Any idea why ?
