Hi all,
Here is our (see copyright section ;)) simple script that help to create 
a bug report:
http://stud.wsi.edu.pl/~piotrowskim/files/ort/beta/ort-b2.tar.bz2
Why do we do this?
Because many people don't have time to prepare a good (with all 
importrant pieces of information) bug report.
How does it work?
It creates file with information about your system (software, hardware, 
used modules etc.), add file with oops into it and in the future sends 
it to the chosen mainterner or lkml.
How can you help?
If you know something about bash scripting you can review it, add some 
useful features and make some optimalisations. Or just send me an idea.
Changelog:
- Paul TT {
 - I wrote a yes_no function tho check answer to "[Y/n]" questions
 - I added some extra checks when multiple answer asked, if the reply is 
blank, bash primt out a lot of unary expected errors
 - added detection of PAGER env variable
}
- Paolo Ciarrocchi - kernel-ort-doc.patch
Regards,
Michał Piotrowski
