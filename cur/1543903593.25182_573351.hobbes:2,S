This sounds like a problem I ran into when I tried to boot a 2.6.21 kernel 
using libata with Ubuntu Edgy installed. The init script on the initramfs 
failed at the same point - not a problem with the drivers, but a problem with 
what the scripts are looking for. I'd suggest looking at the scripts on the 
initramfs - its been my experience that they are the culprit and not the 
kernel itself.
