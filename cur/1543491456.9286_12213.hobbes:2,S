I am continuing to see these messages.  I originally reported these
for linux-2.2.4 compiled with gcc-2.8.1, but they remained with I
recompiled the kernel with gcc-2.7.2.3 and also more recently with
linux-2.2.5 with gcc-2.7.2.3.
In my case, I see these messages when configuring CLISP-1999-01-08.  I
did not see them when compiling either the kernel or gcc-2.7.2.3 or
gcc-2.8.1.  Here are the messages I saw on the most recent attempt:
