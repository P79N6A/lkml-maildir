For example, yes.

Having an interface use absolute timeouts will avoid this strategic error,
simplify common code, and reduce the number of needed syscalls.

Of course, but it is not uncommon, perhaps because it's tedious to
convert between clock ticks and a struct timeval.
There is also the problem that the clock tick resolution has historically
been low (commonly 10 ms), which may cause bigger jitter in the longer term.
Also, a clock_t is frequently only 32 bits wide.
