Right. I know that old SunOS releases did, as did HPUX-6.5 or whatever
it was. But that was ages ago.
Suse has had this code change for a while now in SL10.1 (6 months) as
well as SLES10, and I haven't heard of any interoperability problems,
neither from partners or users, nor from our own QA.

The spec says the same (except it doesn't mention that the cookie is
"normally the same", it just explicitly states that the client must not
rely on the cookie in the GRANT call being the same as the one in the
LOCK call).
My guess is that this was an implementation "shortcut" in the original
Sun code that metastased into all the derived implementations, and when
they discovered it was a bad bug that could lead to lock mix-up, this
sloppiness had spread all over the Unix landscape and they needed to
put stern words into the standard...
In summary, I think more than 10 years after the publication of the
X/Open NLM spec it is acceptable to remove that kludge.
