Well, ok. I forgot to mention, that I have Moxa 8-port serial board
(16550A). It is the only board on 10th IRQ. I use in-kernel serial driver
for it. (configure with setserial).
I also use onboard /dev/ttyS0 for ppp too.

3 interrupts. irq 3,4 for ttyS{1,0}, and irq 10 for 8 posrts on Moxa.
I have 3 rtl8029 based ethernet cards, and one rtl8139 based.
Adaptec 2940UW-2 SCSI card.
Here is my irq map:
irq  0:     79541 timer                 irq 13:         1 fpu
irq  1:      4816 keyboard              irq 14:         8 ide0
irq  2:         0 cascade [4]           irq 15:        56 ide1
irq  3:         1                       irq 16:     20271 aic7xxx, eth0, eth3
                                                          ^^^^
                                        That's inactive channel. eth3 - rtl8129
irq  4:     71348 serial                irq 17:      2740 eth1
irq  8:         1 rtc                   irq 18:       821 eth2
irq 10:      1767 serial                irq 19:     19307 aic7xxx
irq 12:      2058 PS/2 Mouse
> drivers?
No. Although papers with boardstated that there is special kernel driver,
I prefer to use well tested in-kernel ones.
BTW, I have Raid012345 patchset applied, I don't consider this as driver,
it doesn't muck with interrupts and so on. I have 1 raid-1 mirror.
Bye,
    Oleg
