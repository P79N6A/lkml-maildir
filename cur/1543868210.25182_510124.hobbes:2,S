Not necessarily; there are a number of tty drivers, such as the
console drivers and pseudo-tty drivers that have absolutely nothing to
do with an RS-232 port.
On the other side of the argument, another factorization of the layers
that might have made sense was to move the functionality to the
high-level tty layer (or in the case of hangup code, all the way up to
the VFS layer as a generic sys_revoke functionality), but the reason
why it didn't is largely historical.
