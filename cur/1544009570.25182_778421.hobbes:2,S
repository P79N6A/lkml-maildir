hm, i'd rather carry these in the scheduler tree as we've got some 
changes in this area already and because these are arguably scheduler 
changes:
 Documentation/scheduler/sched-design-CFS.txt |   21 +++++++++++++++++++++
 kernel/user.c                                |    8 +++++++-
the incompleteness of CONFIG_USER_SCHED is not addressed yet.
Ok?
