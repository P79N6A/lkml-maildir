I haven't looked at the patches in detail, but I have a concern about
this approach.  How is it that making new architecture-specific
attributes under cpu directories in sysfs is preferable to the already
architecture-specific format of /proc/cpuinfo and other proc entries?
If we're going to create a new user interface for exposing system
topology (cores and threads etc), I would like for it to be as
architecture-neutral as possible.  We already do this for numa, for
example.
