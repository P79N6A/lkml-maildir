Not sure what you mean here.  target is used to retarget an existing MSI vector
to a different processor.  In the case of apic, this appears to be accomplished
by swizzling the cpu in the low 32 bits of the msi address.  Nothing needs to
change in the upper 32 bits.

target is called through the msi_ops->target vector.  SN does not use
msi_target_apic(), it uses sn_msi_target().  Other platforms can implement
target however they need to.

That wasn't a check in the original code flow ... the main protection appears
to be in the upper levels in irq_affinity_write_proc().
