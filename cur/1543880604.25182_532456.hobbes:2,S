Not sure if I understand you here. My view of this was always that the
embedding object was kind of an extended device and that the relevant
driver/subsystem managed it through the driver core infrastructure.

I think I meant the same thing :) Freeing the data in the ->release
callback is obviously too late. Freeing it in the ->remove callback
means that the device is no longer really used (and can't be looked up
any more); only some further refrences may linger (and those are of no
consequence with the sysfs disconnect).
