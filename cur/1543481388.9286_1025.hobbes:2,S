Not for Alpha. The conditional branch instructions take an explicit
source register and a label.
    beq s_reg, label
    bne s_reg, label
and so on. Those and blt, ble, bgt, bge do the obvious (in)equality and
comparisons; blbc (resp blbs) branch if low bit is set (resp clear).
Similarly, you can do conditional register moves based on testing a
source register and there's a family of relational instructions
(cmpeq, cmplt etc.) which compare two registers and set a third
register to 1 or 0. With the jump instructions, you can even make a
hint to the branch prediction logic as to what to do.
