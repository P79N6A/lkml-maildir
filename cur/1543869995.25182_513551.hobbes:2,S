include/asm-generic isn't in the compile include path; its contents are
only ever used if they're explicitly included by some other asm/
header.  I seem to remember there was some debate about this, but I
don't really understand the rationale for the current arrangement; it
makes sense to me to have asm-generic as a set of fallback default includes.

Yeah, it's really only two operations.  activate_mm happens in arch code
anyway, so there's no need to make a fuss about it.
