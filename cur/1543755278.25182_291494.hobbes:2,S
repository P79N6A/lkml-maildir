could you please also react to this feedback:
  http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=110698371131630&w=2
to quote a couple of key points from that very detailed security
analysis:
" I'm not sure how the OpenBSD code is better in any way.  (Notice that
  it uses the same "half_md4_transform" as Linux; you just added another
  copy.) Is there a design note on how the design was chosen? "
that mail also includes a much smaller patch to random.c.
( Obviously the more fundamental questions have to be solved prior
solving code-level problems, patch splitup and patch ordering - often
one ends up having a much smaller patch to work with, by thinking more
about the fundamentals. )
