I found vma->swapout() when I tried to implement it. Sh... 
We could make vma_list_lock a semaphore, but I haven't checked for any
hidden problems yet.

I don't like the idea, but it sounds possible.
A problem could be that the page-in functions can allocate memory:
do_nopage() -> filemap_nopage(): it calls i_op->readpage() which would
call get_block(), eg ext2: load the indirect page, this needs memory -->
OOM.
