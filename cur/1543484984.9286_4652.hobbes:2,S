It isn't clear to me what you are trying to point out here.  I
was just stating that when I type "+++" on any modems around here
with any terminal emulator running, I get an "OK" greeting from
the modem.  The modem happily responds to any AT commands i give
it, and stays online.  An "ATO" switches back to data mode,
however an ATO will kill the connection on some connection types.
I believe one of the error correction modes disconnected on an
ATO in command mode while online.  MNP5?  I dunno...
