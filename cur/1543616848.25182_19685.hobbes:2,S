This board worked fine for several months under 2.2.18
I then upgraded to 2.2.20 yesterday and noticed this problem
for the first time (I didn't try 2.2.19 on it)
I still have the full 2.2.18 installation (I did the 2.2.20
installation on a separate SCA harddisk) so I can easily
switch. To see if it's a hardware problem I already switched
back to 2.2.18 once, and the problem went away.
Under 2.2.20 I have to boot with "noapic" to have it running
smoothly.
So if someone wants me to try or test something, just send
me a short note.
