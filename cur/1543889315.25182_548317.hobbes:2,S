Subject: [PATCH 2/4] AFS: Add a function to excise a rejected write from the pagecache
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/23/308

Add a function - cancel_rejected_write() - to excise a rejected write from the
pagecache.  This function is related to the truncation family of routines.  It
permits the pages modified by a network filesystem client (such as AFS) to be
excised and discarded from the pagecache if the attempt to write them back to
the server fails.
The dirty and writeback states of the afflicted pages are cancelled and the
pages themselves are detached for recycling.  All PTEs referring to those
pages are removed.
Note that the locking is tricky as it's very easy to deadlock against
truncate() and other routines once the pages have been unlocked as part of the
writeback process.  To this end, the PG_error flag is set, then the
PG_writeback flag is cleared, and only *then* can lock_page() be called.
