Hi,
Here are some little bugs in preparsing code :
(Line numbers are all from 2.4.12-ac5 but seems to be the same for plain 2.4.12)
------------------------------------------------------------------ 
I tried to send this one to Rik Faith (faith@valinux.com)
but it seems he doesn't work there anymore ..
Maybe MAINTAINERS should be updated ^^;
 
The bug :
Line 39 of drivers/char/drm/ati_pcigart.h
-> Should be #else (and not #elif with nothing else on the line)
 
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
And an another one. Is there a maintainer for drivers/atm directory ?
 
The bug : 
Line 628 of drivers/atm/nicstar.h
#eliif (NS_LGBUFSIZE == 8192)
-> should be #elif
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------
And finaly, just for the purity of the code :
Line 2473 of drivers/sbus/char/aurora.c
#endif;
-> ';' seems useless
------------------------------------------------------------------
And one question : to whom should I send a patch for arch/ia64/sn 
subdir ?
