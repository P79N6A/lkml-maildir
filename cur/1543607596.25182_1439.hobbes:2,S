Subject: [PATCH] random.c compiler warning
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Hi all,
the patch below removes a compiler warning in random.c. To be exact
it's the first hunk of the patch that does it. There's a comparision
between signed and unsigned values which triggers that warning.
The rest of the patch is just there for consistency and because it just
looks better to me. Those sizeof()s were introduced in kernel 2.4.13, I
just can't imagine why. Care to explain anyone?
René
