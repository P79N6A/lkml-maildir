ah ok. I'm not seeing where that happens.
Anyway, pci_present() could be as simple as "(pci_root_buses!=NULL)".
ide_system_bus_speed() in drivers/ide/ide.c might want this too.
BTW, I'm not convinced the current code does *exactly* what you want.
Hypothetically, we can have a PCI bus but no PCI devices.
Maybe no such system exists but I wouldn't bet on it.
