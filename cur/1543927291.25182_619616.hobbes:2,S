Hi,
I wonder whether these rather large cleanups can already be added to
some mainline branch.
There should be no functional change.
This could make life easier for me (not that bad, there were not that
much changes in the past), but mainly make it easier for others to test
the real patch, that should reduce memory waste in pnp layer and I
expect some testing (especially on older isa machines) will be
necessary...
The intend is to unify the pnp_{port,mem,dma,irq}_... macros exposed in
include/linux/pnp.h and make use of them more consequently.
The patches apply on 2.6.24-rc2-mm1
Thanks,
   Thomas
