Hello all!
 A totally newbie's common question:
 Which is the main improvements in 2.3(2.4) if compare with 2.2
 (except additional drivers)?. Why bother to switch to 2.4 if now
all works ok (at least seems to be so)? Any reason?
 I'm not familiar with the sources, so asking..
 Is there a place in the net to read about it ?
Thank you
Andrei
