I just tested this on top of my patches:
@@ -245,7 +245,6 @@ config IKCONFIG_PROC
 config CPUSETS
        bool "Cpuset support"
-       depends on SMP || NUMA
        help
and it seems to work ok in practice too. On a regular !SMP !NUMA PC
anyway. As you note, the hierarchy is not that exciting. =) Anyway,
both SMP || NUMA or nothing seems to work as dependencies. After
partition_sched_domain() gets fixed that is.

I agree.

Nice to hear that you like the idea.
Maybe I should have broken down my patches into three smaller sets:
1) i386: NUMA without SMP
2) CPUSETS: NUMA || SMP
3) i386: NUMA emulation
If people like 1) then it's probably a good idea to convert other
architectures too. Both 2) and 3) above are separate but related
issues. And now seems like a good time to solve 2).
So, Paul, please let me know if you prefer SMP || NUMA or no
depencencies in the Kconfig. When I know that I will create a new
patch that hopefully can get into -mm later on.

Huh? I sent my patches both to lkml and linux-mm...
Thank you for the feedback!
