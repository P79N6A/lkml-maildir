hmm, I think, on reflection, that I knew that because of having encountered
the swapoff problem after putting a bunch of stuff in a tmpfs...
Regardless,
Since the tmpfs occupies both ram and swap, then having the absolute size
limit based only on ram seems odd.
IMHO of course 8-)

The Linux implementation of tmpfs _does_ use swap:
tmpfs data pages go out to swap under memory pressure.
