Hmm.
I've seen this behavour on windwows as well. (I don't have any 
linux desktops with the chipset atm. Servers yes - but we don't
normally install sound drivers on severs ;-)).
The machines I see this on are Athlon 1600XP with SIS5513 chipset
and an AMI bios.
Over in 'dozeland the problem was fixed by turning IDE DMA off, I
had characterised the problem as being due to I/o bandwidth
starvation, possibly due to a poorly set up DMAC. But given it
was doze I couldn't really investigate.
Phaps 2.5 IDE changes are more relavant.
Does information this help? ;-).
