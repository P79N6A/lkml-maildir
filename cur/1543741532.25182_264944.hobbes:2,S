That's all you had to say.
Progress has to occur outside mainline before it can be submitted.  By
impeding such progress, you potentially prevent things from keeping
current enough to reach a stable point and be ready for mainline
inclusion.  Overall, you're slowing down development and making it more
difficult.

Actually, a few minutes after this, I belted out a cheap and unrefined,
fairly hackish proposal[1] for a similar but slightly altered model.
Commentary on it and refinement may be nice.  Maybe I'm just trying to
make everybody happy, and it's not possible?
