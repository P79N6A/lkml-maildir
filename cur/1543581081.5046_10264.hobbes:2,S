Subject: make problem: -Dfoo=bar and FILES_FLAGS_CHANGED in .flags

When using -Dfoo='"bar"' in CFLAGS, it ends up as -Dfoo=bar in the
.flags file.  This difference causes the FILES_FLAGS_CHANGED to get
set for any files that have that in their CFLAGS, and therefore they
are always remade.
I'm not sure where the right place to change this is, but it looks
like the .c.o rule in Rules.make is where the .flags files are
generated.
