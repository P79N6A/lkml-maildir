Hi,
linux/spinlock_api_up.h uses local_bh_disable() in definition of 
__LOCK_BH(lock) for instance, but it doesn't include linux/interrupt.h, in 
which the local_bh_disable() is defined. So when you compile for instance 
the net/ipv4/ipvs/ip_vs_sched.c or ip_vs_est.c (which doesn't include 
linux/interrupt.h in any direct or indirect way) in a UP configuration, 
you get an unresolved symbol in the resulting objects (though 
local_bh_disable() is just a macro).
However when I tried to include the linux/interrupt.h directly in the 
linux/spinlock.h or linux/spinlock_api_up.h, nothing is able to compile 
with following complaints:

So I'm not quite sure how to fix this best. But I think that ideally all 
publically used includes should be self sufficient and include all stuff 
they use.

P.S.: I'm not really sure who's the maintainer of the spinlocks, and 
though to whom should I direct this bugreport.
P.P.S.: I also filed it as bug #5840.
