Hackbench performance on the NUMAQ is improved by nearly 50% at large
numbers of tasks due to a better scaling factor (which I think is slightly
"more" linear too). It is also improved by nearly 25% (4.08 vs 3.15) on
OSDLs 8 ways at small number of tasks, due to a better constant factor.

And yeah hackbench kills the NUMAQ after about 350 rooms. This is due to
memory shortages. All the processes are getting stuck in shrink_caches,
get_free_pages, etc.
