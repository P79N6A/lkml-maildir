Subject: Need Quota Support for Reiserfs Partition

Hello,
I'm using Slackware Linux with kernel version 2.6.0-test11. All of my
partitions are Rieserfs. I now have a need to use quotas on a partition, but
according to the help screen using "make menuconfig" quotas are only
available under the ext2 file systems. Is there a patch to allow quotas
under rieserfs? One of my searches said that Reiserfs and quotas were
supported under 2.6.0, but when I try and mount the partition with this line
in /etc/fstab:
/dev/hde2 /downloads reiserfs defaults,usrquota,grpquota 1 2
I get this error:
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/hde2,
       or too many mounted file systems
If I take the usrquota,grpquota off, the mount works fine.
TIA,
Bobby
