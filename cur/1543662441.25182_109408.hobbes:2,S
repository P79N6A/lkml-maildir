Did your script include tracing of second-order effects?
The following reference one of the 3 version.h variables but don't include
linux/version.h themselves:
include/linux/coda.h
include/linux/compile.h
include/linux/cyclomx.h
include/linux/istallion.h
include/linux/mtd/cfi.h
include/linux/netfilter_ipv4/ipchains_core.h
include/linux/serialP.h
include/linux/stallion.h
include/linux/videodev2.h
include/net/irda/vlsi_ir.h
So for instance, the ipchains_core.h may explain these files in your list:
/net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_conntrack_core.c
/net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_nat_core.c
/net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_nat_helper.c
/net/ipv4/netfilter/ipt_ULOG.c
/net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_nat_rule.c
/net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_conntrack_standalone.c
/net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_nat_standalone.c
/net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_fw_compat_masq.c
because *somebody* needs to include version.h.
So a patch may be needed, but it should add the #include to the .h file while
cleaning up the .c files.  On the other hand, I'll let somebody who understands
the kernel build system better than I comment on what happens to dependencies
and whether the files that *appear* to be gratuitously rebuilt in fact do need
to be rebuilt....
