IMHO, this is a paper bag bug, but rather than interrupt poor Linus's
vacation, I thought it best to submit it for consideration to
linux-kernel.  My apologies if this is a repeat.  Additional apologies
if this isn't helpful, as this is my first kernel bug report (with
trembling fingers he prepares to click the Send button... :-).
Basically, 2.2.0-final (pre9) crashes immediately after boot for me
after attempting to detect my "SCSI" CD-RW drive (actually an IDE drive
from Digital Research Technologies using IDE-SCSI emulation; chipset
reported is SOCRATES OTI-975).
There are messages about the IDE subsystem not detecting any IDE
interfaces, and delaying IDE detection, although I'm afraid I didn't
catch the messages completely.  If it's important, I'll try to get those
messages verbatim.  After that, though, it goes through my entire drive
list fine (including the CD), the SCSI subsystem starts to kick in,
reports a timeout on resetting the SCSI bus, and hangs.  No damage done
to anything; rebooting to 2.0.36 works fine, as does my old 2.2.0-pre8.
I also checked on my CD status under pre8.  Surprisingly, I couldn't
access it as /dev/scd0; I had to use /dev/hdc.  (It worked fine under
2.0.36; I've even burned CDs with it.)  I guess I haven't been using the
CD recently. :-)
HW config: P133, 64MB RAM.  All IDE system; no "native" SCSI.  hda and
hdb are IDE drives; hda has 64MB swap and about 2.3 GB of root, while
hdb has approximately equal /home and /var partitions of 4 GB.  The CD
is, as mentioned before, hdc; there is no hdd.  Otherwise, it's pretty
standard; there are two modems using IRQs 11 and 12 for ttyS2 and ttyS3,
a WD 8013 at 0x300 IRQ 10 mem 0xcc000, and a Creative Sound Blaster 16
at IRQ 5, 0x220, 0x330, DMA 1 and 5.  (No second printer port.)
Software: pretty standard RH 5.2 with many of the updates:

I think that covers Appendix B info.  Let me know if there's anything
else needed.
ObGushingPraise: I've only just started running kernels higher than
2.0.x, and I was shocked at how much faster it was.  I am literally able
to run software I couldn't run before due to speed issues.  Many thanks
to all.
