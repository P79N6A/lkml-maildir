Not for parisc at the instruction level.  In narrow mode (32 bit mode),
a u64 load has to be done by two 32 bit loads which gives it a 4 byte
alignment requirement.  In wide mode (64 bit mode) the 64 bit load
instruction explicitly requires 8 byte alignment, so our u64 alignment
requirements are different.  However, this is from the machine code
point of view.  I can't say that gcc doesn't enforce an artificial 8
byte alignment of u64 in narrow mode, so I'll defer to the gcc experts
on that one.
