I've two things in mind to try:
(1) there is 1 newer official BIOS release and 2 beta BIOSes out for
this motherboard. The recent official BIOS (0901) does mention Linux:
   "Fixed Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 installation failed"
So maybe a BIOS update will fix things.
(2) I will try booting with the "noapic" kernel option to see what
difference that makes.

So I guess these drives should be added to the ata_blacklist_entry in
libata-core.c with ATA_HORKAGE_NONCQ?
