UNIX security policy is already implemented in the
Kernel, or should we move checking of root priveleges
and file permissions to the userspace? I just extended
existing security features.

No :-) What you suggest is kernel should receive
system call from user space. Instead of handling it -
kernel should forward it back to userspace, than it
should be forwarded back to the kernel. Looks not very
nice to me. Why not to handle security policy inside
the kernel as it is done for the file permissions and
root priveleges?

All LISP errors are incapsulated within LISP VM.

What reason you have in mind? All available security
models have predefined stack usage, so it is
completely safe to use them. 
For those who want to define their security model (not
security policy!) - they shoud respect stack
limitations for now. Which sounds reasonable. Using
existing security models it is impossible to cause
stack overflow. (depth of subroutine calls is
constant).
