If he is running in a bottom half or an interrupt handler, this wouldn't
work. No task context to sleep on.
Depending on the definition of short, it may be easier to just put the code
to execute on the tq_scheduler task queue. That will give a short delay
between the interrupt or bottom half that will usually be less than a tick.
As I understand it, putting it on the tq_scheduler queue makes it run after
all the other bottom halves but before the scheduler switches tasks.
According to the documentation I've got it is even safe to use
schedule_timeout() from there, although I'm not sure that is a good idea.
