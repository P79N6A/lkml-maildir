Well i was expecting that.

Doesn't this all get taken care of by the platform_device_unregister?

I know it's begging for abuse, but i don't want to sprinkle empty 
release() functions everywhere, e.g. looking at the floppy driver, i'm 
not quite sure what i'm supposed to do with a release() function there, 
the struct platform_device_struct is statically allocated. Basically i'd 
like a pointer as to what to do with these release() functions..
Thanks,
