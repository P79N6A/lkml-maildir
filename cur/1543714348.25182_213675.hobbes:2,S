Subject: 2.6.5+BK compile error: binfmt_elf on sparc64

Because of -Werror, it bails out:
In file included from arch/sparc64/kernel/binfmt_elf32.c:154:
fs/binfmt_elf.c: In function `load_elf_interp':
fs/binfmt_elf.c:369: warning: comparison is always false due to limited range of data type
fs/binfmt_elf.c: In function `load_elf_binary':
fs/binfmt_elf.c:780: warning: comparison is always false due to limited range of data type
It's the comparision "elf_ppnt->p_memsz > TASK_SIZE".
p_memsz is Elf32_Word, TASK_SIZE is defined as
#define TASK_SIZE       ((unsigned long)-VPTE_SIZE)
At the first glance I can't see what's wrong here.
