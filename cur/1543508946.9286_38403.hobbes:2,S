This may be where I think you went wrong (slightly ...)
  If you installed the kernel sources from the RH CD you need to
	- get the sources
	- cd /usr/src
	- rm linux	(this is a link to linux-2.2.5)
	- now unpack the sources, and continue on...
	    I like to:
		 mv linux linux-2.2.12	#eg
	         ln -s linux-2.2.12 linux

    If make mrproper removes .config, what does make oldconfig do if
    there is no .config?
