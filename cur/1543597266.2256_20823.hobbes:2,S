Where does someone find/get BIOS version F5a for the 6VXD7?
The latest that I see on the Gigabyte web pages is F5.
Thanks,

Hi,
  Gigabyte (and/or AMI and/or VIA) decided that it is not worth 
of effort to create full mptable and since version F5a for 6VXD7 
they do not report PCI interrupts as 16-19, but only as traditional 
0-15 (and they do not report them as conforms/conforms, but as 
active-lo/level).
  For now I hardwired correct routing table into my kernel, as
I have other uses for IRQ < 16, but after some investigation I 
found that ACPI _SB_.PCI0._PRT element returns correct routing 
table (using IRQ 16-19). So my question is, are there any plans 
to use ACPI tables to get IRQ routing tables, or should I complain 
to Gigabyte that I'm not satisfied (I'll complain anyway, but...)?
                                        Thanks,
                                                Petr Vandrovec

P.S.: No, there is no MPS1.1/MPS1.4 switch in BIOS (anymore) :-(
And no, there is no way to disable ACPI in that BIOS :-((
/* Old working BIOS... 6VXD7 - F2 */

/* 'Broken' 6VXD7 - F5a */
