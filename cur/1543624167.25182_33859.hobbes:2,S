It's part of the TOPS-20 filesystem.  If you try to create a file which
already exists, you get a new version of the file with length zero.  Each
file has a version limit in its directory entry, and when the limit is
exceeded the oldest version is automagically deleted.  The version limit
is copied from the highest existing version to the new version, and the
limit on the highest version determines whether old versions are dropped.
VMS does something similar, although ODS-2 tries to be clever by packing
all of the versions' index-file pointers together after a single copy of
the version-less name in the directory block.  Originally the two used
different punctuation to set off the version number, but when Digital
killed the PDP10 line VMS was adjusted to accept the TOPS-20 form as well,
as a sop to LCG customers who were being steered into an unfamiliar
product line.  IIRC TOPS-20 names were name.extension.version, while VMS
native names are name.extension;version .
RSX-11 (VMS' ancestor) may have had versions too.  I've only used the
hacked RSX20F variety used as the console monitor for KL10 systems, but I
seem to recall versioning there.  Or maybe I'm recalling the RSX-11 flavor
(POS) which ran the Pro300 console on the VAX 8800.

Indeed.  The only essential relationship between two versions of a file is
that their names resemble each other.  The content is entirely distinct.
It was usually used to prevent the "oops, I shouldn't have saved that"
syndrome.
