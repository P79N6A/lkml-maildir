You're missing something.  The chance for a collision _per wrap_ is
reduced, as you said.  But the number of wraps goes up.  Overall and
for large numbers, the two effects compensate each other.
For not-so-large numbers, you can get by without the wrap by having
this per-sb.  And if you have just one or two wrapping filesystems, at
least the others are protected.  It's not much, but it is a simple
thing to do.

Absolutely.  Thinking about it, iget() already has a lot of what is
needed - except that it can block and has side effects we don't really
want.  Sounds more complicated, but I would love to be proven wrong
here. :)
