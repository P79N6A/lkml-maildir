The line discipline write routine is serialized
on a per tty basis in do_tty_write() of tty_io.c
using tty->atomic_write semaphore, so you will not
reenter write_chan() for a particular tty instance.
Even if this were not the case, if the task state
changes to TASK_RUNNING inside the window
you describe, the only thing that happens is the loop
executes again. The driver must decide if it can accept
more data or not and return the appropriate value.
There is no potential for deadlock.

True, but this is a matter of layering.
The line discipline knows nothing about the driver's concept
of write completion apart from the driver's write method
return value. If it is critical for the write not to complete
until the URB is sent, it is up to the driver to block
and return the appropriate return value.
