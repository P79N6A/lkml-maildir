I see what you mean of course (the usual problem is that we never know
if gcc could make such decision for whatever subtle optimization, asm
optimizations are all but intuitional). But I just giveup also about the
other thing of reading from C variables that can change under us. So I'm ok
assuming gcc does what we expect here too, even if I'd prefer not to.

There should be proper macros to handle those userspace sig_atomic_t
because of that. Anyways I certainly believe there is code playing with
those types from C by hand :).
