I have similar complaint against PNIC chip. If for some reason I
disconnect cable and reconnet the link won't be restored unless I ifconfig
interface down and up. It is kind of also hard to figure out what's
current speed of the interface (say it sets full duplex, but it does not
say if it is 10 or 100).
Still I kept it for myself since I did not have time so far to figure out
where I can find latest drivers for tulip for 2.2.x and 2.4.x kernels.
MAINTAINER's file does not list web site and the drivers for beckers 
are usually for stable kernels, not bleeding edge like 2.4.x.
Linux Tulip driver version 0.9.9 (August 11, 2000)
eth0: Lite-On 82c168 PNIC rev 32 at 0xc800, 00:A0:CC:62:2B:2A, IRQ 16.
eth0:  MII transceiver #1 config 3000 status 7829 advertising 01e1.
