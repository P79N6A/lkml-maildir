Gave the machine a bit of a workout to create the problem sooner than 
usual, albeit on a smaller scale. ksoftirqd consumed about 4.7% of the 
CPU according to top after several concurrent wget operations, and had 
accumulated about 6 seconds of runtime, unheard of for a system uptime 
of 15 minutes; the output attached is during this.
Hopefully I'm right in assuming that; on all other systems I've 
experimented with ksoftirqd doesn't even flinch unless subjected to 
extremes.
Did some further testing with a machine of identical configuration 
(suffers the same issue too); removed iptables from the suspects list, 
as the issue exists sans those modules.
Hopefully the attached shows some irregularity. If not, I'll have to 
reply back in a few weeks when the problem recurs over the course of time.
Cheers,
Brad
