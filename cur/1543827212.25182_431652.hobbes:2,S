You're totally inappropriately focused on this whole "porting back" side.
THE WHOLE POINT IS TO NOT PORT THINGS BACK.
There is absolutely no point in any ext4 work being ported back to ext3, 
since the whole point is a fork like this is to have the "stable" thing.
Yes, old bugs happen and sometimes exist in both, but hey, the number of 
duplicated bugs - while not non-zero - is still less than the bugs 
introduced by trying to keep things in sync.
