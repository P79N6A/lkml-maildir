With this move if the path has to be activated first, will the daemon 
have to call some sort of ps_path_is_initialized() function before it 
calls generic_make_request?
It might be easier if mp's map_io call did not move so it or the ps 
could send commands and wait for the response before selecting a path. I 
guess this would mean you would have to add a access function for the 
tio's map_info so it could be set from the daemon, or mp may need to 
allocate its own io wrapper. It seems the latter may now be needed to 
give ps's a a map_info, becuase dm-mpath needs to store the path in the 
tio's map_info.
