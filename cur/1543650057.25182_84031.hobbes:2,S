Firstly, you need klogd running with -x so the numbers within [< and >]
are preserved.  It is a shame that these distributions still run klogd
without -x.

This is a line from the kernel which ksymoops can't interpret.
ksymoops needs to know which modules are loaded, and where they
are loaded so it can give accurate call trace information.
BTW, an even better option would be to enable CONFIG_KALLSYMS.
