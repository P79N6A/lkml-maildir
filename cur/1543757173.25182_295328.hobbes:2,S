Strange indeed.
First thing to test is to disable sonypi (either rebuild a kernel
without it or rename the module so it will not get loaded again),
then reboot and see if you still have problems.
If you do, the problem is ACPI/input related.
If you don't, the strangeness comes from some interraction with
sonypi.
