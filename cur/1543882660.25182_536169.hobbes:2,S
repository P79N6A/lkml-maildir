Subject: X display shift with disabled console blanking

I have a problem whereby the X display 'shifts' to left when anything 
writes to /dev/console - where console screen blanking has been disabled 
i.e. doing something like:
boot to run level 3
If not root, then make sure /dev/console is writeable
login and type:
setterm -blank 0
start X
type into an xterm:
echo "some random text" > /dev/console
(may have to repeat the echo above a few times)
... and the whole X display jumps (and wraps) to the left
I'm using a RHEL4 based distro with a vanilla 2.6.21 x86_64 kernel 
(although I've seen the problem with various x86_64 and i686 2.6.X kernels).
I've seen this problem on a number of different nVidia cards - using 
the vesa driver (same problem occurs with nVidia's binary driver). I 
haven't tried using other makes of graphics cards.
OK, this may be a strange combination of disabling the text console 
blanking and running X, but something isn't right somewhere ...
Any ideas?
Thanks
