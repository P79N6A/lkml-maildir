| Silly question: you _do_ have CONFIG_SMP=y, yes?
| 
Oh, no I don't :( So the problem is in kernel sync (as I thought)...
damn... I have to rebuild my kernel... but hold on - my machine has only
one CPU ;)
| And did you enable lockdep?
| 
Yes
So the problem is 'cause of mark_inode_dirty may sleep? Right?
So only thing to be checked is lock_kernel I think
