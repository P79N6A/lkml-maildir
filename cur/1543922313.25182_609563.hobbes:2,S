True but if we are talking about a true stackable architecture calling
down to your lower component shouldn't be an option it should be a
requirement of the semantics. I would hate to think some module which is
a subset of the restrictiveness of another could override it because its
"sufficient". If that was the case I could load in a module which just
returns 0 for everything and make it "sufficient" bypassing every other
module. This also introduces ordering dependencies. If you install
MultiAdm before AppArmor or SELinux and make it "sufficient" then you
defeated the point of having AppArmor or SELinux installed in the first
place.
