Oh, sorry. I'm uploading pre-8 to ftp.kernel.org right now.
A lot of things actually became a lot cleaner with the "two counters"
approach. There may be something I missed, but it was a pleasure to do the
changes.
Whether it WORKS is another matter ;). It runs fine here, but I bet there
was some detail I missed.
Note that my implementation changed a bit from what I outlined yesterday
evening: the non-lazy mm's count as just "one" in mm_count. So instead of
doing
	if (atomic_dec_and_test(&mm->mm_users)) {
		drop user space parts
	}
	if (atomic_dec_and_test(&mm->mm_count) {
		free the page table and the mm
	}
if became
	if (atomic_dec_and_test(&mm->mm_users)) {
		drop user space parts
		if (atomic_dec_and_test(&mm->mm_count) {
			free the page table and the mm
		}
	}
instead. It made things simpler in some other areas.

We make all the "best" decisions on the mm anyway, so as far as I can see
we would find the same mm regardless of which approach we took. No?
The only difference is when somebody has an active_mm that doesn't even
exist as a non-lazy VM, but when that happens the VM should have been
cleared up already anyway, so that should be a non-issue as far as
swap_out() is concerned.
