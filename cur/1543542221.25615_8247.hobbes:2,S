	It may make more sense for things like /proc/pid/XXX/mem to be a symlink to
/proc/tgroups/XXX/mem. If all members of a tgroup share their fds, it makes
sense to symlink /proc/pid/XXX/fd in this manner as well.
	The problem is, the mapping of vms to tgroups is usually, but doesn't have
to be, one-to-one. Same for fds. You can artificially solve this problem
with the following rule: A call to fork preserves the existing tgroup if and
only if both the vm and fds are shared.
	This works well for the POSIX threading model but isn't exactly elegant.
	DS
