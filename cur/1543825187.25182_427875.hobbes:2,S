Too easy indeed.
After staring at these changes, and not having anything poke me in the
eye that looked like it might cause list corruption, I decided to try
them in a different kernel.  I put them into 2.6.16-rt25, and there they
work peachy.  A diff of 2.6.16-rt25+git-cfq.patch->2.6.17-rc4-mm3 shows
what I was expecting (locking changes), but it's embedded in ~1000 lines
of diff, and doesn't look particularly trivial.
