Umm, I must be missing something, I get here 1024k minors, 64k disks with 
15 partitions and 16k disks with 63 partitions.
Anyway, the sooner userspace accepts that dev_t number is just a number 
the better. The major/minor split is useless information in userspace and 
it becomes less and less important in the kernel.

SCSI already enumerates the devices sequentially, without userspace tools
already now it's very painful to manage thousands of disk, but all the
kernel can do is to give you all the information about the disks it has
and the number you can use to access the disk. How you call that thing is
a userspace issue not a kernel issue.
A lot of information is already exported via sysfs, missing information 
can be added. Changing the kernel to sequentially assign dev_t numbers 
starting 0x10000, when they are registered via add_disk, is a rather 
simple change. Then you have can have 16M disks with 256 partitions, that 
should be enough for a while?
What mostly is missing now is the userspace code. I haven't seen a 
request, that someone has simple daemon and needs now this and that 
information from the kernel to map a disk reliably to a name.

If you only want to do it once, then do it right. There are 2 basic 
questions, which have to be answered:
1. How do we want to manage dev_t numbers in the future?
2. What compromises can we make for 2.6?
Without answering these questions now, we risk to pay heavily for it 
later. The ones who ask now for a larger dev_t the loudest are likely the 
first to demand later not change anything for "compability", because they 
hardcoded certain assumptions about dev_t into their applications.
