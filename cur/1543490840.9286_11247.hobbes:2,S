I had a PS/2 mouse freeze with 2.2.3. My freeze was not related to virtual
console switching.
Replugging the mouse did not help.
I run gpm on /dev/psaux, and feed the X server off of /dev/gpmdata.
I was able to restore the mouse by killing and restarting gpm.
The gpm daemon is run as:   gpm -R -t ps2 -3 -m /dev/psaux

I have a plain motherboard: baby AT, Intel chipset, Socket 7, USB, DIMMs.
It came with a floppy for an "INTEL PIIX4 IDE BUS" driver.
The mouse is a 3-button M-series Logitech MouseMan.
