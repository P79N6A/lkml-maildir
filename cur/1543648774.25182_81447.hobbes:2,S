Hmmm. I was thinking of possibly doing something similar to the 2.4
CONFIG_X86_HAS_TSC and CONFGI_X86_TSC_DISABLE, but I believe Linus
wasn't super happy about negative config options. You're usage sounds
reasonable, but since this is a cleanup item, do you mind if we both
look at the issue a bit more next week?

Not right this second. I'm waiting for the summit subarch code to
stabilize, then I'll hook it in correctly.
