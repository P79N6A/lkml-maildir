thanks,
then what about the arm-realview-mpcore?
I found that in mpcore there are 4 cores, the cpu0 boots first, and
the others wait in the WFI(wait for interrupt) state. as far as i know
it is the boot monitor set these cores into WFI state. I just wonder
what happens after these cores get the interrupt. they jump to the
kernel? or sth eles? if they jump to the kernel, to what address? and
these jump instructions are in the boot monitor?
sorry for so many questions....
thanks a lot.
