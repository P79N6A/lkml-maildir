I am looking for the meaning of the following key codes as #defined in 
include/linux/input.h. I need to know what hardware produces the keycode 
and what happens/should happen when the corresponding key is pressed.
KEY_AB
KEY_ANGLE
KEY_ARCHIVE
KEY_CONNECT
KEY_DIGITS
KEY_MACRO
KEY_ISO
KEY_LIST
KEY_POWER2
KEY_QUESTION
KEY_TEEN      # 1- ???
KEY_TWEN      # 2- ???
KEY_RED, KEY_GREEN, KEY_YELLOW, KEY_BLUE  # Video text navigation?
I am currently trying to make all special keys just work by fixing the 
whole keyboard/input stack from the kernel up to the desktop 
environments. On part of this effort is to complete the mappings applied 
to the keys during their way up.
TIA
