Right before the first nfsd_setuser_and_check_port()?  I don't believe
so.
The way it works is: the rqst_exp_find() calls bump the reference count
on the export they return to us, as expected; so if we bail out after
that line 185, the exp_put() at "out:" drops that reference, as it
should, making fh_verify a no-op with respect to the reference count.
The only time we need a new reference is when we store that pointer in
the filehandle, around line 233, as that's what creates a long-lived
reference that will outlive the function.
The other cache_get() (in the "just rechecking" case) is there just to
balance out the final exp_put() so every code path can share the same
code at "out:".
I find that a little contorted.  So I'll go ahead and submit this small
patch to 2.6.25 and stable now (I have since managed to reproduce what I
believe is your bug, though my symptoms were a little different), and
then submit to 2.6.26 some cleanup which makes this more understandable,
and brings fh_verify() a little closer to the kernel's aesthetic of
small, minimally-indented functions.
That said, I'd definitely still appreciate your confirmation that this
fixes your bug, so thanks for offering to retest that Monday.
