Your tale of woe just shows that you are unfamiliar with
whatever Linux Distribution you are using and, your expectations
that somebody here should hear about it on this list shows that you
don't know what "kernel" means.
Next. Fix your line-wrap. Your mail is unreadable on `pine` and/or
the usual Unix tools like `mail`.

If you want one of these things, you just make one. You can use a kernel
compiled for modules and make  a GUI or whatever that searches for the
correct module to install for your hardware. That's what the RH
distribution does for its initial configuration. It also checks for
new devices upon each startup. If you want something different, just
make one.
If you think you can make a kernel configuration program that will
work in text-mode as well as graphics, and you don't like the current
one, you just make one. If it's really good, you can get it to be
part of the kernel distribution. But I warn you, it is not as simple
as you seem to believe.
