it is seems to be more general problem, because it slows down not only
dpkg process - booting on 2.4.26 kernel takes about 5 minutes to
complete and of cause no dpkg is involved in that process.
I took dpkg as just single example, I don't what to try else on...
bogomips reports about 50% of what is in /proc/cpuinfo, so it looks
normal... I'm suspecting IDE, so it looks like when app has to work with
HDD then it slows down although HDD bulb doesn't report an activity....
but I might be wrong. btw - I will put hdparm as well on the
webpage
We are about to setup X on that beast and I will try may be some other
programs... suggestions?
