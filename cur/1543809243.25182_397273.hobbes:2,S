Anything that locks the machine while sound is playing will cause the
last period of audio to repeat in an endless loop, because the DMA
engine keeps running but the soundcard isn't getting new data.  It's not
specific to interrupt disabling.
Isn't it fortunate that network cards don't work this way? ;-)
