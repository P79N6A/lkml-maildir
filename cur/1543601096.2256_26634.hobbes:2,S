You misunderstood what I meant.  This is the first case of one driver
supporting two different cards, one 10/100 and one 10/100/1000.  All
the gigabit cards are 10/100/1000 as far as I know.  I still think the
driver should be listed in both the 100 Mbit and 1000 Mbit Ethernet
menu sections, unless someone comes up with a better idea.
