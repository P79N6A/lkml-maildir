Junk everything except the 15K drives, you will be glad you did.  Too 
bad about those multi-year support contracts, hopefully you got a deal 
on them.
Prediction: after these dirty pages issues are gone, there will be more 
dirty page issues because the notion of dirty page limit is 
fundamentally broken.  Your smartest recourse is to re-motherboard to a 
place where the dirty page limit borkage does not hurt as much, and in 
the process you will get a cheap hardware upgrade.  Everybody will be 
happy, the sun will come out, the birds will sing.

Daniel
