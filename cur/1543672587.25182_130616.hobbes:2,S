What version of 2.5?
There was a patch 17 days ago by Chuck Ebbert (merged by akpm) that
"fixed" PCI scan order in 2.5 to be same as 2.4.  Comment in changelog
says "Russell King has acked this change."

An alternative is to use 'nameif' to associate MAC addresses with
interface names.  See here for mini HOWTO:
