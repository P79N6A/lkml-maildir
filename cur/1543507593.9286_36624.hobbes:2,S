Martin, only one minor nit.  You cannot allow drivers to arbitrarily
change resource values _without_ updating the resource tree.  In fact
this kind of stuff was #if 0'd out in the bttv.c driver for example.
We need to either provide an interface to allow a driver to do this,
or remove all such instances as the PCI probing boot code should be
setting these things properly.
Later,
