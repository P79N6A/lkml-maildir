> Are you willing share your code? I'd love to see what you have so far since I have a similar project.  It is basically using a wireless link that supposed to look like a terminal.  I'm hoping that all I'll need to do is make a simple driver to implement hard_start_xmit and let pppd do the rest.  Probably like your radio, it has a 0-7 network id which I assume you are including in your MAC addr some how.
For network protocols you might also want to look at the daemon called
"scarabd" that Robin O'Leary and I did years ago for a low speed radio
modem that needed software to manage things like tx/rx, carrier handling
and so forth
