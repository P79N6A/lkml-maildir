There was a 2.5.x kernel that allowed me to use cpufreq with it but the
recent ones just give me this message:
cpufreq: Intel(R) SpeedStep(TM) for this chipset not (yet) available.
Now I know it worked before cos I noticed it and played about with the 8
speed steps I had available to me (and I thought I only had 2).
What information is needed about my chipset to make the code detect it
properly?
(not on cpufreq ml btw)
