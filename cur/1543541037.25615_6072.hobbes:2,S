urandom is the device to use if you want unlimited random numbers.

/dev/random is a secure random-number generator.  It uses external stimulae
to produce these random numbers, and keeps an track of the entropy of the
random pool.  Once it detects that there's not enough randomness in the pool
to guarantee that these numbers are secure, reading from /dev/random will
block.  This is its design.

There are other interfaces in the random number stuff.  f.e. keyboard
scancodes/busmouse stuff are also used.  Any interrupt with the
SA_SAMPLE_RANDOM flag is also used.  In 2.4.0, I also see that randomness
is added at the end of processing a request (__scsi_end_request in
scsi_lib.c).
