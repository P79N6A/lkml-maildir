We don't have that many places where we put global names in
the linux api.  Yes there are several and it is painful,
but we are nowhere near as high as you expect.

Each bit currently maps to one logical piece, that is why I expect
to have enough bits.

Being short on bits should keep us thinking about keeping things
in logical chunks.

Good that means we can still optimize this.

Sounds reasonable, and I have nothing against it.
I simply think at this point where we are still struggling to
get the simplest namespace merged and working correctly that is a premature
optimization.

Makes sense.  I have no problem against that as an optimization,
and it is firmly on the todo list as something to try.  Right now with
only 2 non-thread clone flags I believe it will obfuscate the code more
than help performance.
