You are not telling us what the error message is.
You are not telling us what hardware you have.
You are not telling us anything about how your kernel is configured.
Basically you are not telling us anything.
How on earth do you expect anyone to be able to answer your question?
I'd strongly suggest you read 
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/docs/lkml/reporting-bugs.html
 (as well as 
the documents that document refers you to), then after you've read that 
use the suggested bugreporting form at the end and submit a new mail.
And while you are at it, take a look at 
http://www.tux.org/lkml/
 as well.
Kind regards,
