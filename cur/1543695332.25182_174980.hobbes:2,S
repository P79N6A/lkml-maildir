I think I can confirm this problem but give not so much informations. I
had a 1200 Mhz Athlon running on a board with a onboard-controller and a
promise udma 100 controller. I connected my dvd-write to one of these
controllers, I don't know which anymore and I had corrupted data too,
the system had nearly no load and I would guess that I had perpahs 5
places on a dvd which where corrupted. I used dma. The writer and the
cable worked fine in a system with a dual-p3 with intel bx chipset. I
think I was running a 2.4 kernel, newer than 2.4.20 I think. I currently
got this system offline because I am moving. If you need more
informations I will perhaps be able to gain them in a week or so.
