While that is true, that assertion does not hold everywhere.

I'd like to be able to switch off the normal and highmem zones and leave
just the DMA zone behind.  The normal and highmem zones are just a waste
of space on ARM.

I'm sorry, we're going to have to agree to disagree then.
As for your assertion that it's "crappy DMA devices" there are modern
PCI based platforms being produced by Marvell (which were designed by
Intel) which can only DMA from 64MB of memory, inspite of the PCI
device having full PCI busmastering capabilities.
At the end of the day, it is _far_ simpler from an architectural point
of view for memory to live in the DMA zone and disable the normal and
highmem zones than it is to selectively populate the normal zone
depending on whether device X is configured, and then also have to hack
around various drivers which decide they want to use __GFP_DMA because
of some antequated x86ism which doesn't apply on non-x86.
