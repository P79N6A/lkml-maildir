I tried it also with SMP enabled and disabled PREEMPT and
big kernel lock preempt - it also crashes.
So there's no need for a yet more professional sysadmin I guess.
Try it yourself on your machine if you have handy some intel 925X series
to crash.
I did it on 2 asus p5ad2-e premium boards, they both crash the same way.
