Right.  The basic question is on a problem system are MSI interrupts
from the card in /proc/interrupts observed.  If interrupts are not
observed (as it sounds like is the case) it is most likely something
outside of the card, and driver.  If interrupts are observed but the
card does not work correctly it could be a card or driver bug.
Ok.  In the archives I finally found the output of cat
/proc/interrupts and there were none.
This is a PCI-E to Hypertransport system from the lspci output.
Can I get the corresponding lspci -xxx output.  I suspect the BIOS
did not program the hypertransport MSI mapping capabilities correctly.
All it has to do is set the enable but still, occasionally BIOS
writers miss the most amazing things.
If that is the case with just a little creativity we should be able to
write a pci quirk that will enable the MSI mapping capability on this
class of systems and save ourselves a lot of trouble.
Although I thought I did see a quirk that disabled MSI if the enable
bit was not set.  Hmm.
Anyway please the lspci -xxx output.  Although if someone could teach
lspci to decode the hypertransport MSI mapping capability so that
lspic -vvv gave us this information that would be great too.
