Last time (2.6.17-rc6-ck1), I had a strange experience over the regular 
scheduler. When three gccs were competing for time, each of them got a time 
window of 1/3 second in which each ran at 99%.
The regular scheduler does it in a way so that each time window is as small 
as possible, that is, top shows 33% for each process on low top 
udating intervals like 0.1 sec.
This behavior was not observed with 2.6.16-rcX-ck.
