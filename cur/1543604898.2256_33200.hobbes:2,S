Hi,
I have noticed that the login program on my Linux
2.4.x boxes is sometimes putting the "Password:"
prompt on vc/1, even if I'm trying to login to vc/6.
This login program is from the "shadow password"
utilities, whose password-authentication routine
always gets the current terminal from /dev/tty rather
than trusting the inherited one.
I have only noticed this problem on the first attempt
to login to a vc after a reboot, and I have noticed it
on both a UP, 64MB, non-devfs and an SMP, 1.25 GB
devfs box. 
I haven't tested any of the -ac kernels, but I have
observed this on at least 2.4.7, 2.4.10, 2.4.11 (ahem)
and 2.4.12.
Cheers,
Chris
