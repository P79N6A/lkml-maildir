Yes, we could add context sensitivity to the dcache with a context 
bitmask.
However, it's _not_ correct.
It assumes that there is only one way to do lower/upper case, which just 
isn't true. What about different locales that have different case rules? 
Your "one bit per dentry" becomes "one bit per locale per dentry". That's 
just horribly hard to do.
I don't know how Windows does it, so maybe this thing is hardcoded, and 
you don't even want "true" case insensitivity. How "correct" is Windows?
(And don't even bother telling me about the translation table in NTFS 
volumes - I'm not interested. This would have to work on a sane filesystem 
to be useful, even for samba.)
