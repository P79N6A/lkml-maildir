This is really very similar to my problem with BP6 I'm reporting for a
long long time.
But everyone says its faulty board.
For BP6 somehow helps to set UDMA to mode 2.
(I'm not getting these locks when I'm just using ATA33 controler)
(hdparm -X66 /dev/hdX)
Also could you look at what is being written to console ?
(run those intesive programs and stay on console - BP6 lock with 
this message displayed:
hdf: timeout waiting for DMA
ide_dmaproc: chipset supported ide_dma_timeout: func only 14
In this point it looks like timers are dead... :(
And the situation is the same with SMP & NoSMP kernel with apic &
noapic.
