I had such issues when using suse 9.3  inside vmware very often - typically 
removing network configuration completely in yast and re-adding it fixed it 
for me - but sometimes it re-appeared, though - and i never knew, why.
Due to lack of time, i never dug into the device detection routines in 
depth, but i assume there must be some issue in older suse with that 
routines around "Waiting for mandatory devices" .....
It seems, that this has gone better in more recent distros, but i see that 
problem from time to time.
You may also try setting MODULE_LOADED_ON_BOOT in /etc/sysconfig/kernel , 
please report if this helps

Just came across this one - maybe it`s worth taking a look:

I am having a problem with 2.6.20 based kernels on SUSE 9.3. It boots
fine except that the network card is not detected at boot time. After
the system boots I can "modprobe <nic module>" and the network comes up
fine.
I am having this same problem on two different Suse 9.3 systems, one is
a a dual Xeon the other is an AMD Athlon. I have no such problems on
Suse 10.1 systems on similar hardware. Kernels prior to 2.6.20-rc? work
fine on these systems.
The dual Xeon is using a 3Com card with the sk98lin driver.
0000:06:00.0 Ethernet controller: 3Com Corporation 3c940
10/100/1000Base-T [Marvell] (rev 10)
The Athlon is using a SIS900 with the sis900 driver.
0000:00:04.0 Ethernet controller: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS]
SiS900 PCI Fast Ethernet (rev 91)
I get the following when the system is booting:
