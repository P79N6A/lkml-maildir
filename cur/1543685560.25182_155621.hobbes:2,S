I think that data in BT848's memory is transferred to graphic card memory
to show the captured data at monitor.
Am i right?
If right, what variable is pointed to graphic card memory  in device driver
code?
(I think in /drivers/media/video/bttv-driver.c)
Or is memory  in graphic card managed by more complex scheme as page?
Please answer, thanks.
