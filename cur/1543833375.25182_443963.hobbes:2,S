I think this is a bad idea.
It's not safe to reuse this existing feature bit: if we do, then any
existing 2.6 kernel prior to the change will mistakenly think that it
understands that feature for read-write, and will therefore be likely to
corrupt data.  And we are not remotely short of feature bits, so there's
no pressure to free up existing bits.
Removing the flag from the tree will remove what is essentially
documentation that this flag cannot be reused.
Cheers,
 Stephen
