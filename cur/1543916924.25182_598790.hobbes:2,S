Sure, attached.  [Note: the kernel has been compiled with both NO_HZ and
HIGH_RES_TIMERS unset.]

No, it's not.  The mainline _usually_ doesn't boot with "apicmaintimer".
It seems to me that _sometimes_ the CPU just doesn't enter this C1E state
and then everything goes fine ...

Can't tell, I have only 64-bit userland here.

Well, I'm only making sure that future kernels will run on my box. ;-)

Yes, I've already tested it and sent a reply.  It works. :-)

Well, it was wrong.
I have some problems with resuming from suspend to RAM using 2.6.23-rc8-mm1
with this patch applied, but I think they are related to something else.  I'll
wait for the next -mm with debugging that.
For now, I'm going to build 2.6.23-rc8 with my collection of suspend patches
plus patch-2.6.23-rc7-hrt1.patch and the "disable APIC timer for AMD C1E boxes"
patch applied.  I'll play with that a bit and let you know how it's behaving.
Greetings,
Rafael
