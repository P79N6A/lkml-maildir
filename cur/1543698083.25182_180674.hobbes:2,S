Ha, Andrew - you know these things, I know these things - please
do not confuse matters.
My first letter had as essential content: the Linux 2.6 kernel
does not make geometry information available to user space.
Thus, if user space asks the kernel and prints an error message
in case the answer is unexpected, then such user space is broken
under 2.6. There is nothing to gain from asking the kernel.
That was a letter for you - parted should be fixed, otherwise
there will be a long sequence of users that worry that things
might be wrong.
My second letter was for Szaka and affirmed that fdisk cannot
change this non-existent geometry. You still believe in fairies,
I mean, in disk geometry, that is OK, I don't mind, but still,
whatever it is you believe in, fdisk cannot change it.

I am happy with that description.
"Disk geometry is: some numbers that your BIOS invents".
Of course, details are always more complicated.
What the BIOS invents may be dependent on user settings in its setup.
There are also numbers that certain operating systems or boot managers
invent. Equal to or different from what your BIOS has thought of.

Just ask yourself this question: does Windows XP require a bootable
partition to start below the 1024 cylinder mark?
Windows NT4 has such a restriction. Not Windows 2000 or XP.

Good. We agree.
