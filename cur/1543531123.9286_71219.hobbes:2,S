Hi,
I've just seen on opensound.com that they are supporting the old
SoundBlaster 16 ASP (ISA).
grepping around in drivers/sound for ASP didn't return anything. does
anyone know anything about existing support for the
Advanced Signal Processing (ASP) that shipped a long time ago on 
the SB16 line of cards ?
I happen to have such a card. it's been working like charm for years
under linux (OSS/SB16 driver), but I would love to use the additionnal
horse power that it hides :o)
