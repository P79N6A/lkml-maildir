Probably this isn't fix the problem, but can you try the following?
CONFIG_8139TOO_PIO=n
CONFIG_8139TOO_TUNE_TWISTER=n
(both config to "n")

This may not be the problem of 8139too driver, because 2.4.24's

Umm.. possible of cable or hub problem, but 2.4.24 is work...
Do you know lastest worked version?

however, the interrupt status wasn't cleared by read.
