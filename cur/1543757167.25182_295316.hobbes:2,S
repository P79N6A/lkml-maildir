Hello,
does anyone have some experiences with intel i855 video card and S3?
For me the binary driver from Intel works with S3 but only X server is restored
not the text console. 
With open source driver nothing is restored. I try to use s3_bios or s3_mode,
nothing helps. Using  vbetool and post causes backlight turn on but display is
full of garbage (vertical lines of different colors).
