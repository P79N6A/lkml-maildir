Bzzt, wrong answer.
Partial reads/writes are perfectly possible and non-buggy for any system
that uses variations of mmap/mprotect to implement user-level memory
management, for example persistant data-bases, garbage collection etc.
Which means that if half of a buffer used for "read()" just happens to be
marked non-writable for some GC purpose, the kernel HAS to have the
ability return the right answer (which in this case is to say "I could
only read 1000 bytes"). Because anything else just doesn't give the GC
library (or whatever) any way to recover nicely.

Rusty, face it, you're wrong on this one. Just drop it.
