The machines all all DP Xeons, our SP machines run the same kernel, but 
these oopses only occur on DP machines under heavy load.
The machines are recognized as SMP:
# uname -a
Linux lxb000 2.4.20 #2 SMP Tue Dec 17 10:43:29 CET 2002 i686 unknown
but the e7500 chipset seems not to be supported 100%:

There might be (are) severe flaws in our NFS configuration and network 
performance, but that should not crash the box, should it?
BTW: I just received a link to a bux incl. fix that sounds similar to 
our problem: http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-nfs&m=104716581307294&w=2
With kind regards,
