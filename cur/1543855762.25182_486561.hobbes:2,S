It doesn't appear to handle clock switching, so for instance, if generic 
time switches from the tsc, to the acpi_pm would the latency tracer 
tolerate it ? Also a combination of HRT enabled, and a faulty acpi_pm 
would cause the tracer to use the PIT .. The PIT takes spinlocks during 
it's read so I'd imgaine the system would crash, or something else not so 
good.
Also with HRT enabled, you would end up using the acpi_pm even if the TSC 
is stable which is slower ..
That's what I mean when I say constrictive .
I've been working with John and Thomas to make the clocksource more 
usable (and lots of cleanups),
