Thanks.  Also ACK.
However this raises the question of why no-one has reported spinlock
deadlocks despite this bug being in 2.6.17 and 2.6.18.
It turns out the code was never exercised due to other bugs.
This patch fixes those.  Andrew: I notice the first fix has gone into
rc3-mm1. Thanks.  If that and this could get to rc4, that would be
great.
Thanks everyone,

Subject: Fix refcounting problems in rpc servers
From: Neil Brown <neilb@suse.de>
A recent patch fixed a problem which would occur when the refcount on
an auth_domain reached zero.  This problem has not been reported in
practice despite existing in two major kernel releases because the
refcount can never reach zero.
This patch fixes the problems that stop the refcount reaching zero.
1/ We were adding to the refcount when inserting in the hash table,
   but only removing from the hashtable when the refcount reached zero.
   Obviously it never would.  So don't count the implied reference of
   being in the hash table.
2/ There are two paths on which a socket can be destroyed.  One called
   svcauth_unix_info_release().  The other didn't.  So when the other was
   taken, we can lose a reference to an ip_map which in-turn holds a
   reference to an auth_domain
   So unify the exit paths into svc_sock_put.  This highlights the fact
   that svc_delete_socket has slightly odd semantics - it does not drop
   a reference but probably should.  Fixing this need a bit more
   thought and testing.
