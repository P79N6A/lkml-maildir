I think you missed the subtely of what I said.  It's not "their duty"
to never make a mistake, and it is not expected that they will catch
everything.  When they do miss something, or make a mistake you probably
tell them in a straight forward fashion.  In this case, what you
effectively said to me was:
	"Hey.  I would appreciate it if you would stop not
	 noticing this change that I made to your code through
	 Linus without telling you. *Twice* no less.  Wake up!
	 Wasn't it obvious?  It is *your duty* to notice these
	 one line changes that happen to break the build on
	 a platform that I care about but doesn't have any
	 consequences on the platforms you are probably testing.
	 Oh, and the aic79xx driver... well I didn't bother to
	 look at that because it's not in my configuration.
	 Oh well."
And I get all of this grief *after* I already included the change
instead of after the first time I missed it.  You really make me
laugh!
