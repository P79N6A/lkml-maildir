Hi,
The e1000 driver supports zero copy for sending already for a long time
(if I remember correctly, since 2.4.3 kernel or so) already. Zero copy
receive is a much harder issue, and for that you need more
infrastructure; I think the IOAT patches that got merged last night in
the post-2.6.17 tree will help for that, but I do not know if what got
merged is sufficient already for full support. 
I hope this answers your question; if not I would like to ask you to
explain in more detail what you mean by "enable zero copy"...
