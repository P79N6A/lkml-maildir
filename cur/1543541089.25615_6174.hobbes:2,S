That was originally an accident on my part. I'd got into the habit of 
sending a patch to Linus each time I released a tarball of the MTD code. 
I sent it to Linus last time merely out of habit, rather than any real 
expectation that he'd include it into 2.4.0-test$n. But he did, and I'd 
forgotten that it also happened to include JFFS.
Mea Culpa.

That I can't say. Possibly because it has zero effect on the rest of the 
kernel if you don't turn it on.

Actually, to the best of my knowledge, Transmeta aren't using it yet.
Certainly we've had no input from them. 
For some reason, I believe Linus is actually capable of maintaining a
separate patch to the kernel for his own internal use. And if the Transmeta
devices are intending to ship on 2.4 any time soon, then he knows something
we don't, or has finally flipped.
P.S. I can _assure_ you that no fellatio was involved.
