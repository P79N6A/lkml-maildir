Hello !
I'm personnaly using this simple patch with success with an usb disk on
key. It adds an option "setuptime" which waits the requested amount of ms
before booting. I use it with "setuptime=2500" and my USB works fine.
I think it could be of a more general use, and perhaps it could be
accepted into mainstream if it doesn't break anything ?
Cheers,
Willy
