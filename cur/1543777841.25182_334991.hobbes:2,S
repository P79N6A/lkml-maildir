I have the same problem, throughout 2.6.11 to 2.6.13-rc1, maybe before.
It pops up when CONFIG_ACPI=y (CONFIG_X86_UP_APIC,IO_APIC or UP_IO_APIC does 
not affect this!) && when my ISDN card is active, e.g. I'm online. If it's not 
online, everything is fine.
APIC error on CPU0: 02(02)
This only shows if I run `klogconsole -l8`, which means this message is 
printed with KERN_DEBUG.
I do live on UP, though. Everytime I get this message, the ERR counter 
increases.

Need more info?
