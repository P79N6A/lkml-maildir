Hello,
I get an error similar to the following the 2.3.18ac9 when the tulip
module is attempted to be loaded:
init_module:  resource or device busy
I see this during the init scripts, and also if I try to insmod tulip
manually afterwards.  lsmod shows no modules loaded.  Tulip is in fact
configured to be a module in .config.
I've been chasing an apparent IRQ mapping bug in 2.3.18ac8, and saw
Petr Vandrovec's report on tulip and ac9, so was trying the new patch
to see if my difficulties went away.
I do not see this message under 2.3.18ac8 (same disk, same scripts,
etc), and am in fact able to use the tulip module under ac8 in a
limited way.
