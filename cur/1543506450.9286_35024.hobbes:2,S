You should read the mails more carefully before replying :-)
I said that I disabled tcp_timestaming. My problem is not permanent lack
of _throughput_ (at least not anymore), but occasional increase in
_latency_ by a factor of 20.
BTW: Has anyone got a clue what part of the OSI cake is responsible for
that? I.e. should I forward the message that started this thread to the
isdn4linux people, too?
