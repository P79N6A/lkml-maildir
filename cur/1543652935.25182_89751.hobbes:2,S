That will not only ease useless emails sent to you and Martin and other admins, but also make it easier for kernel hackers to figure out which bugs are _really_ unassigned and need owners.
Sounds good - I'll see if we can set something like that up.
I'm happy for pretty much anything owned by "mbligh@aracnet.com" 
to be stolen away ;-) 
How about you give me a week to try to persaude the "real" owners
to volunteer (that's actually going really well), and then I'll
send out an email, listing which categories are still ownerless ...
