Hi Ingo,
-51-06 and -51-08 are looking stable on the UP Athlon box with the
following patch which causes edge triggered hardirqs to be masked when
pending _and/or_ disabled (instead of both pending _and_ disabled) and
backs out a change from -50-44 that prevents pending edge triggered irqs
from being unmasked:

The first chunk is based on my understanding of the comments in io_apic.c,
and is not necessary to keep the UP Athlon box stable.  Is my logic OK 
here, or am I missing something really important?
Without the last two chunks of this patch, the UP Athlon box locks up hard
as soon as jackd is started up.
