Assuming that such a user could precisely and accurately predict
when to return ESTALE, the particular system call would just stay
in the kernel, sending out requests to the NFS server.
It wouldn't overflow the stack because the recovery is done by
looping and not by recursion and unless there is a bug that needs
to be fixed, all necessary resources are released before the
retries occur.  The machine wouldn't freeze because as soon as
the request is sent, the process blocks and some other process
can be scheduled.  The process should be interruptible, so even
it could be signaled to stop the activity.
It seems to me that mostly, the file system will become unusable,
but as Bruce points out, what do you expect in the presence of a
malicious entity?  If such are a concern, then measures such as
stronger security can be employed to prevent them from wreaking
havoc.
    Thanx...
