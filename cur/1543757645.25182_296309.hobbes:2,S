a) Activating a snapshot requires a lot of memory;
b) If a snapshot can't get the memory it needs you have to back it
out manually (using dmsetup - some combination of resume, remove & 
possibly reload) to avoid locking up the volume - what you have to do 
depends how far it got before it failed;
c) You should be OK once a snapshot is active and its origin has 
successfully had a block written to it.
Work is underway to address the various problems with snapshot activation
- we think we understand them all - but until the fixes have worked their 
way through, unless you've enough memory in the machine it's best to avoid
them.  
Suggestions: 
  Only do one snapshot+backup at once;
  Make sure logging in as root and using dmsetup does not depend on access 
  to anything in /var or /home (similar to the case of hard NFS mounts with 
  the server down) so you can still log in;
BTW Also never snapshot the root filesystem unless you've mounted it noatime
or disabled hotplug etc. - e.g. the machine can lock up attempting to 
update the atime on /sbin/hotplug while writes to the filesystem are blocked
