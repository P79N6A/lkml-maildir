Yes, and I miss why that matters. Let me see if I can make the idea clear
to you:
  2.4.22-pre5		some code
  2.4.22-pre5-bk1	fixes
  2.4.22-pre5-bk2	more fixes
  2.4.22-pre5-bk3	still more fixes
  2.4.22-pre6		fixes to date plus major changes
So when a maintainer got something major it wouldn't go into bk (the
commercial software database) until a new -pre, while the -bk patches
available for download would get the fixes only.
Just a matter of staging, so that after a new -pre the -bk patch files
against it would hopefully get more stable for a few days. A new -pre need
not have something major, it would be nice if they came out every few
weeks at most. Any -pre release is an adventure, but usually there are a
few days of minor fixes posted, and it would be nice if those got
somewhere before the next major change.
Did I make it clear this time? You don't have to agree it's a good idea,
but I'd like you to understand what I have in mind.
