The volume of mail bugzilla-mail generates is obscene.
I've been on vacation for a week, and I have over a 1000
mails waiting for me from rh-bugzilla when I get back
to give you an indication.[*]
A month worth is just mammoth, and unless you have a lot
of spare time on your hands (or you have have a masochistic streak),
most of it will go unread, so I'm not sure such an archive
would be particularly useful.
I do have a bunch of scripts for rh-bugzilla that could probably
be adapted to osdl-bugme to obtain stats etc like
"show me how many bugs are in state x for kernel y", I'll
take a look at doing that soon.

[*] Ok, rh-bugzilla gets a 'little' more than osdl-bugme does,
but that may not always be the case, especially if escalating
bugs to upstream becomes easier.
