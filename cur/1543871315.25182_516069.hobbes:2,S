But hardware PC boards don't do anything as remotely complicate as 
changing the semantics required for correctness in you MMU 
implementation.  There might be some weird MTRR and caching things, 
which are a property of the architecture, and which all modern boards 
have in common.  You don't have completely diverse implementation 
properties like shadow vs direct vs native page tables.  Or hardware 
virtualization vs direct CPL raised execution.  You simply can't test 
this diversity by making an educated guess, because in this case, 
something will always be omitted.  The test matrix has to be raised, and 
if that is a problem, the burden of proper testing shifted onto the 
manufacturers, just as you would with some new PC board or new 
architecture that wanted to be Linux friendly but was radically 
different in some way.
