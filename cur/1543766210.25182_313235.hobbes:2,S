OK.  I downloaded, patched and started the build.  Basically everything
stops when I get a "microtek.c:338: error: `FAILURE' undeclared" error
(the build keeps trying, but no modules get created).  
I suspect others may have the same problem, but feel free to e-mail me
for more information (and you will have to as I am not on the list).
...ok, also I have tried adding 
     #define MTS_SCSI_ERR_MASK ~0x3fu
---->#define FAILURE           ~0x3fu
on line 55 of microtek.h ...basically a copycat of the previous error
line...(but I suspect the kernel maintainer would be a better person to
define FAILURE somewhere...)
And...it does boot and I can

TIA,
