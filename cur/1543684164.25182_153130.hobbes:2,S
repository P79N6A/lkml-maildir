What makes you think this is a hang?  Does the disc activity stop?  If you 
press the caps lock or num lock keys does the LED light up?  What I'm asking 
is could it have been swapping for some reason?  I've had the system go 
unresponsive on me quite recently, also when running KDE.  It easilly took a 
two or more minutes to start responding again.  The disc light stayed active 
all the time it wasn't responding.
