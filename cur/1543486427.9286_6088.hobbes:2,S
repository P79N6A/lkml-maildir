dtfs holds lots of promise mostly because its the closest to actually
working 8) and it is fully compatible with ext2. From what I remember you
just plug in 'fs personality modules' into dtfs and presto, you have
logging for XYZfs.
Aside from a real LVM (eg growable fs) the lack of a logging FS is the
last big hurdle towards Linux HA. There are lots of smaller hurdles though
