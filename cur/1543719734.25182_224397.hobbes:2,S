what was your driver setup?
Ideally, there should be two PCI devices ("combined mode" disabled), one 
for PATA and one for SATA.  The PATA interface should be configured in 
legacy mode, and the SATA interface in native mode.
That seems to be the most stable configuration.
(that also presumes you use the IDE driver for PATA and libata for SATA)
