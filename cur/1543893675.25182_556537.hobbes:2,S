Hm, currently it should be ok to move the call to model->shutdown() into
nmi_shutdown(), but you might want to instead set addr to 0 when the
register is released to still allow for per cpu actions in shutdown().

This was fixed in commit 0939c17c7bcf1.

Hm, ouch. I'll try to move the reservation parts into a separate system.
