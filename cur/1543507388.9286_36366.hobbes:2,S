The ipvs folks are doing IP level load balancing with inverse masquerade
-ie
			internet
                          |
			[MASQ]
        +------+--------+-------+-------+------+
       www1   www2    www3    www4     www5   www6
incoming SYN frames create masquerade sessions mapping user->www to user->www1
www2, etc according to load and rules.
In one mode they set things up differently as follows
		internet
                   |
    +-----+-----+-----+-----------+----------+---------+
    |     |     |     |           |          |         |
 MASQ    www   www   www         www        www       www
         www1  www2  www3        www4       www5      www6
Each host is www and a unique name. The masq host arps for www, then
tunnels the packet to a www[1-n] but without rewrite. The reply doesnt touch
the masq so is a lot faster.
However they need to stop www1->wwwn arping for their www tunnel address
