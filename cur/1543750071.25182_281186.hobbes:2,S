Hi lkml!
Maybe it's not good to ask the lkml, but since there are so many experts
here, it makes sense to me.
I have a dhcp-server running with 2.6.10 (had it running with
2.6.{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} as well) and the dhcpd logs all the time:

Now my question; Is this normal? Where does it come from? Why does it
happen? For me this seems strange...
FYI. I have the server running with the above mentioned kernel and Fedora
Core Development Tree (dhcpd 3.0.1).
Any help is welcome!
Best regards,
 Oliver
