Thanks, he already contacted me himself.
It seems that the maintainer information in the driver files is somehow
outdated, and I'm to stupid to correctly read the MAINTAINERS file
('grep -i cciss MAINTAINERS' does not work as the driver is listed as
'HEWLETT-PACKARD SMART CISS RAID DRIVER' there...)
Thanks for your help,
Markus Schaber
