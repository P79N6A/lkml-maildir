Where is your proof?  This is quite true for a machine on a  
_network_, but my suspended laptop isn't.  You say that I am not a  
security aware user and that therefore you are automatically right,  
but it doesn't make it so.  What is the practical vulnerability in my  
laptop's suspend-to-ram, given that it automatically locks all VTs  
and X when sleeping?  Don't you *dare* say "somebody could attach a  
hardware debugger and read your data out of RAM", because I just  
don't see that happening in any reasonable situation, there are too  
many obstacles to doing that with a _laptop_, the first of which is  
just that it's impossible to take the damn thing apart when it's on  
without disconnecting massive amounts of critical wiring.  Even if  
that _is_ a risk-case for you, it's not the use-case we should  
optimize suspend for!

Right, the process goes something like this pseudocode:
put_devices_to_sleep(); /* [1] */
if (suspend_to_ram) {
	call_firmware_suspend();
} else {
	atomically_freeze_state();
	wake_devices_up();
	store_state_to_devices(); /* [2] */
	put_devices_to_sleep();
	switch(mode) {
		SUSP_SHUTDOWN: shutdown();
		SUSP_REBOOT:   reboot();
		[.......................]
	}
}
Remind me again why we should implement suspend-to-RAM as part of  
suspend-to-disk?  Especially since the _only_ shared functionality is  
[1] which is already separated out for other reasons.  A lot of  
people also seem to want to initiate and control all of [2] in  
userspace, whereas the suspend-to-RAM case needs just one syscall.

You still have yet to prove that suspend-to-RAM and suspend-to-disk  
have anything to gain by being wrapped in a big if statement.

Actually, I seem to recall that even before _either_ of those were  
working decently a bunch of modern hardware had good suspend-to-RAM  
support.

Personally, I really don't care if you (or whoever) wants to merge an  
intermediate suspend-to-disk/software-suspend implementation.  I  
think it would be helpful on a lot of laptops where suspend-to-RAM  
doesn't work or chews battery.  But I _really_ don't want to see  
somebody trying to patch suspend-to-RAM/hardware-suspend into that mess.
> We need (and can get) suspend to work *NOW*,
It does work now, suspend-to-RAM/hardware-suspend has been working  
perfectly on my laptop for a long time (modulo a couple powerbook USB  
bugs that crept in recently and got removed).  IMHO, a modern laptop  
that doesn't support suspend-to-RAM is a broken design, although I  
realize that it happens all too often.

On this I do agree, but _please_ don't muck with my suspend-to-RAM  
along the way because of some egotistical "We are new-fancy-kernel- 
software-suspend, resistance is futile" type thing, ok?  Suspend-to- 
RAM/hardware-suspend and suspend-to-disk/software-suspend are two  
_completely_ different things and should not be treated the same at all.
