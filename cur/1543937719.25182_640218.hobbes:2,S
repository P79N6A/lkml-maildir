Subject: [PATCH 004 of 4] md: Fix an occasional deadlock in raid5 - FIX
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/18/152

(This should be merged with fix-occasional-deadlock-in-raid5.patch)
As we don't call stripe_handle in make_request any more, we need to
clear STRIPE_DELAYED to (previously done by stripe_handle) to ensure
that we test if the stripe still needs to be delayed or not.
