  How about support for backporting patches, e.g. backport csets
1.2000.4.120 and 1.2000.12.16 to kernel 2.6.9?  I could see no way to get
bk to spit out these two changes as patches against 2.6.9.  Given all the info
in there this should be trivial...
  But first you should write some actual documentation and fix your programs
so they emit error messages when something goes wrong:
[me@d4 linux-2.6]$ bk c2r -r@v2.6.9 mm/vmscan.c
[me@d4 linux-2.6]$                                               <--- what???
[me@d4 linux-2.6]$ bk tags
<snip>
ChangeSet@1.1988.97.17, 2004-10-18 11:50:06-07:00, torvalds@ppc970.osdl.org
  Linux 2.6.9
  TAG: v2.6.9
<snip>
[me@d4 linux-2.6]$ bk c2r -r1.1988.97.17 mm/vmscan.c
1.231
  'bk help terms' says a tag can be used, but apparently not and there's
no error message.
  Then there's this one:
[me@d4 linux-2.6]$ bk difftool -rv2.6.8 -rv2.6.9 mm/vmscan.c     <--- forgot the @
child process exited abnormally                                  <--- hee hee!
  I like the way the GUI flashes up on the screen then abruptly disappears, leaving
the user wondering what happened.

  But you're located in a large American metro area, a.k.a. "hell on earth."
