Subject: fsx failure on ufs2

Hello,
For an embedded system, I'm currently evaluating the robustness of ufs2 
write support on Linux, and my very first test, with fsx, shows serious 
problems.
My test bed is a single CPU PC with a single IDE disk, that boots FreeBSD 
6.2 and Ubuntu 7.10. The kernel on Ubuntu is a vanilla 2.6.23.9 with UFS2 
write support. fsx is from the freebsd cvs (with a small patch to build on 
Linux, see after my sig):
   
http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/src/tools/regression/fsx/
The test is as follows:
# mount -t ufs -o ufstype=ufs2 /dev/sda10 /mnt
(Yes, /dev/sda but it's really IDE.)
$ ./fsx -c100 -N 100000 /mnt/test_fsx
fsx exits in error, after producing the following files:
-rw-r--r-- 1 foo foo 196256 2007-12-14 16:56 test_fsx
-rw-r--r-- 1 foo foo 196256 2007-12-14 16:56 test_fsx.fsxgood
-rw-r--r-- 1 foo foo  63167 2007-12-14 16:56 test_fsx.fsxlog
The file test_fsx.fsxgood contains what fsx expected to be in test_fsx; 
the files differ only in the last 4K chunk (it seems there should be only 
zeroes, but it's not so).
There does not seem to be any problem with ext3.
Can anyone else confirm this problem?
Cheers,

Trivial patch for fsx.
