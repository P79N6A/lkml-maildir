It's no regression of the driver.  The problem is just a wrong use of
alsactl in your init script.  It should use -F option to ignore
unmatching elements, which is caused when a mixer element is removed
or renamed.
This problem doesn't happen so often (as we try to keep the
compatibility as much as possible), so I didn't realize some distros 
still doing wrong for years.
Anyway, this won't be a problem in future since I changed the default
behavior of alsactl to with -F.
