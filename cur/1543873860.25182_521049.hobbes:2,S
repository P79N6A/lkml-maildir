From #0889:
 "I have noticed some strange system behavior. When i try to build a
 kernel (medium load) - X, keyboard, mouse and sound hangs."
Note that ping is handled in interrupt or softirq context. So something has
locked up. Try without X? Or perhaps attack a serial console/netconsole, and
when it hangs, use Sysrq to dump the process' states.
