Unfortunately, I think this is an important point.
Developers depend strongly upon a subsystem maintainer to
"make time" for these things so that work integration does
not get delayed past the merge window if at all possible.
Not being able to "make time" to do these things is a great
way to lose contributers.
James, whilst there is no doubt in my mind that skill-wise
you are probably the most capable scsi maintainer, your "lack
of time" is sounding like a broken record and harming the
development process.
