arg...with -mm2 sda3 is sdb3. Using an other kernel rootfs is still sda3
and I have to change /etc/fstab each time for each test.
Kernel 2.6.13rc1 makes it better and does not move my rootfs but it is
still not working. I can see all ide devices (hda and hdb on ICH6 and
hde instead of sda on ITE8212) but I can't read or copy any file.
Accessing a file on dvdrom (on ITE8212) it get following error
in syslog:
hde: media error (bad sector): status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hde: media error (bad sector): error=0x30 { LastFailedSense=0x03 }
ide: failed opcode was: unknown
end_request: I/O error, dev hde, sector 1305136
Buffer I/O error on device hde, logical block 326284
Mounting hdb (cdrom) I get the "drive appears confused" error message
and linux hangs.
Mounting hda (disk, fat32) I takes a long time to copy a small file.
Also every minute I get the error "irq 201: nobody cared".
Syslog with kernel parameters pci=routeirq and apic=debug is attached.

When I disable idedisk, idecd and ide-generic I don't get any of the
errors but I also do not have any ide device (hda, hdb, hde) in /dev.

I don't know how to do that.
