Well, that has always seemed likely to me, given that rebooting without 
a keyboard is something that works on pretty much everyone else's 
machines!  But to some degree the bug ought to be worked around.

That helps, but there are still situation(s?) where it's not a complete 
solution.  It's good enough for what I need, though.
Starting with no keyboard, plug one in:
$ drivers/input/serio/i8042.c: aa <- i8042 (interrupt, aux, 0) [161928]

Oops, it doesn't respond to anything... We unplug it and plug it back in 
again.  This time it's ok:

input: AT Translated Set 2 keyboard on isa0060/serio0
This, because it checks in i8042_interrupt to see if the nefarious 
STR_AUXDATA is set, which it is...  According to your hypothesis, 
plugging the keyboard in and hitting a few keys would have cleared the 
AUXDATA bit, so the next time around it works fine.
