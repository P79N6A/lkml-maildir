I guess by non-ACPI path you refer to the MP_TABLE. So in case you boot
with "acpi=off" the system falls back to the MP_TABLE information and
this is not covered yet.

The reason why the list of quirks isn't larger is that there's no
documentation available in public for some of the chipsets. For example
for Nvidia and VIA chipsets. Note that there is only a problem if more
than one IO-APIC exists in the system. Additional IO-APICs usually
appear on PCI bridges. We have not encountered any systems yet that are
Nvidia or VIA based with more than one IO-APIC. But your mileage may
vary.

The main difference here is that "noapic" disables any IO-APIC in the
system, whereas the patch leaves them intact. We won't be falling back
to the PIC instead we fall back to the first IO-APIC.
What difference does this make? We won't lose all the enhancements of
the IO-APIC over the PIC. What comes to mind first is that, when using
the PIC all non-MSI interrupts have to be dealt with by CPU0. You have
no IRQ balancing, pinning and such things.
