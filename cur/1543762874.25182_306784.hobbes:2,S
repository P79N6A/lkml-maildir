Hi. I've searched the archives about this stuff. It looks like you
attempted to change the EXPORT_SYMBOL's to EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL for sysfs
stuff back in February, and the issue in general has come up many times.
A few people have made the point that Linus has said that changing
EXPORT_SYMBOL to EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL is not okay, that they are supposed
to start off as EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL or somesuch. And it seems last time
you tried it, something made you change it back. 
Can you explain this, please?
