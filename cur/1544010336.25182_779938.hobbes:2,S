Apologies, I was working with an old tree.  __unsafe has been deprecated.  To
accomplish the functionality of unsafe, we simply need to not register an exit
routine, as per Adrian Bunks commit when __unsafe was removed.  I'm leaving the
ibmphp_exit function in place though, just in case the author decides later that
it is in fact safe to remove.
New patch attached.

Neil
