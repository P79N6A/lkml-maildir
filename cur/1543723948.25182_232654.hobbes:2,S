1.  At any -O level, I'd assume the loop optimizer or something along
those lines would see a 1 iteration loop and remove the actual loop
instruction:
MOV CX,1 ; 1 iteration
...
LOOP ; Just DEC CX and falls through
In the pseudocode above, we can clearly see that the MOV and the LOOP
perform no real function.  The optimizer *should* AFAIK notice that a
do{...}while(0) generates useless looping instructions and thus prevent
those instructions from being generated.  In the case of do{}while(0),
this generates 0 instructions.
2.  A function call to a no-op is an unoptimizable and excessive
overhead compared to do{}while(0) in most cases; the no-op would need to
be inline assembly, thus maintained for each arch, AFAIK.
3.  An actual no-op instruction still needs to be iterated past by the
processor.  Usually, no-op is only generated by the compiler for
padding, AFAIK; and even then, there's some kind of jump before the load
of no-ops to get past them.  I don't know if inline assembly is
optimized out; but I would assume not.
4.  I don't think /* empty */; is an error; but the following block has
problems:
if (foo)
~  ;
else
~  do_something();
So, we need something that gets parsed to exactly nothing.
Thus, as far as I can understand, because we use -O2 or -Os, we will
always get exactly 0 instructions from do{}while(0).  This is the best
solution to the problem.
