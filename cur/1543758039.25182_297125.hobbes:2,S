Hi.  Thanks for the patch.  Have you tested it?  If you don't have any
ATA over Ethernet hardware, you can using the alpha vblade program for
testing.  (Run it on a system in the broadcast domain of the host
running your patched aoe driver, and vblade will export any file,
e.g., /dev/loop0, as block storage.)  It's at
  
http://sf.net/projects/aoetools
I was trying to determine what sparse warnings you see, so I got
sparse from bk://sparse.bkbits.net/sparse and ran it.  Your patch cuts
down significantly on the complaints, but there are some that persist.
Maybe you're using an older version of sparse?

The "array abuse" is something that I'm not all that enthusiastic
about changing, since it's mostly a style issue, and last time I
changed it the way your patch does, the original author of the patch
changed it back.  But you've figured out how to make sparse happy, and
for that I'm grateful!  :)
