 Can comebody remind me what the initramfs is for in that situation,
please ?  From the little I've noticed, I thought the /dev/disk/by-id
part went into fstab ?  At the moment, I just build the things I
think I need in to the kernel on that box, without modules.
 Anyway, I'll try to find time to read my notes to see if I can
identify what happened/when, and to take the box down again so I
can try to confirm exactly what the problem is, if it still exists.
I certainly won't be taking it down until I've written my weekly
backups to tape at the weekend, so maybe not before next week.

 My previous kernel was 2.18-series, I think at that time they were
still under development.  This box handles the backups for my
various desktop boxes, which is why I'm very conservative about
changing it.  I guess the drivers are stable now, I'll maybe give
that a go (depending on time).
