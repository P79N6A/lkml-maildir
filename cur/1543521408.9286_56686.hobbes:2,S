Hi!
If am starting first  my "tvprogram" (xawtv) [+ loading manually msp3400/tuner] I am not able to
change the soundvolume in xawtv and I am not able to play for example a mp3 with mit "mp3player".
(=> modul "sb" is not loaded).
But if I am first starting my "mp3player" (=> "sb" "sound" "soundcore" "uartt401" are loaded) and
then "xawtv" (+ manually loading "msp3400" / "tuner") all is working properly and I am able to
change the soundvolume in "xawtv" and in my "mp3player".
What could be the reason that only the second "way" is working.
thank you
richard
