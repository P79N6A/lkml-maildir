Subject: Add a private_data pointer to struct device_attribute
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

A private data pointer in struct device_attribute allows the 'show' and 'store'
functions to access instance data.  This handy in situations where the
driver_data and platform_data pointers of 'struct device' are already used
for other purposes.

Greg, can you tell me if you think this patch is a good idea?  It doesn't
appear to do any harm, and I'm working on an ALSA driver that could benefit
for this patch.  I think 2.6.25 would be a good target.
