Friends,
Is it correct to invoke "sock_sendmsg"  for UDP 
socket,  from  "net_tx_action"  Tasklet  context.
I understand that tasklet is interrupt context, for this reason i masked
sock->sk->allocation &=  ~__GFP_WAIT;
even tried merely assigned GFP_ATOMIC
It always panic at    skb_head_from_pool / __skb_dequeue inline function 
called from alloc_skb.
Thanks in advance,
regards,
- nalin
