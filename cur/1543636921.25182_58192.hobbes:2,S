I usually don't use words like this, but can you just shut up?
I mean - if Bartek, or me, or whoever, wanted to be the 2.5 IDE king
now, I'm sure Martin would pass the thorny crown quite happily.
When noone else says that, I'm very impressed about where the IDE code
got from before Martin started. And after talking to him at the Kernel
Workshop I must say he has a very good vision where he's heading to.
The only problem that pisses of a lot of people is that he just spews
patches at his own rate, not synchronized with Linus, so that Martin's
latest 'stable' doesn't usually match Linus's releases.
Now that the most aggresive changes are behind us, I believe things will
go a tad smoother ...
Anyway, I guess I should just shut up and go back to fixing that SiS IDE
driver, too ...
