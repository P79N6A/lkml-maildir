On PPC machines, the PTE has a bit called G (for Guarded) which
indicates that the memory mapped by it has side effects.  It prevents
the CPU from doing speculative accesses (i.e. the CPU can't send out a
load from the page until it knows for sure that the program will get
to that instruction) and from prefetching from the page.
The kernel sets G=1 on MMIO and PIO pages in general, as you would
expect, although you can get G=0 mappings for framebuffers etc. if you
ask specifically for that.
Paul.
