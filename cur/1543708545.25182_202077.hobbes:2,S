Thanks for the clarification.
Yes, "implementation specific" is one of the differences between IA-32e
and AMD64, i.e. that behavior is architecturally defined on AMD64, but
on IA-32e (as I posted): 
  Near branch with 66H prefix:
    As documented in PRM the behavior is implementation specific and
should 
    avoid using 66H prefix on near branches.
