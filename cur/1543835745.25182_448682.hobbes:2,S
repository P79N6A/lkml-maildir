I ask because your clam differs from the only detailed research that
I'm aware of on the subject[1]. In figure 2 of the iron filesystems
paper that Ext3 is show to ignore a great number of data-loss inducing
failure conditions that Reiser3 detects an panics under.
Are you sure that you aren't commenting on cases where Reiser3 alerts
the user to a critical data condition (via a panic) which leads to a
trouble report while ext3 ignores the problem which suppresses the
trouble report from the user?
