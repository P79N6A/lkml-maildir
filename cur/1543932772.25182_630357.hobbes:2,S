Since I was getting the problem with both vanilla & CFS patched kernels
and that, sadly, I don't have the time to do git bisect at the moment I
decided to go ahead and prepare a full migration to 2.6.23 (I was hoping
to skip directly to 2.6.24 but...).
I can confirm at the moment that 2.6.23 works properly with Galaxy (just
has 2.6.20 & 2.6.21 used to...).
Thnx very much everyone for the help but sadly this bug will have to
remain unresolved.
