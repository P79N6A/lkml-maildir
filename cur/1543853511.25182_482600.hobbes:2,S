I think I have pushed the new tag, indeed the gitweb interface on
kernel.org/git shows correctly the 1.5.3 tag (and also two new commits
after that).
I've also pulled from kernel.org/git/qgit in a test repository and got
the tag succesfully.
I'm not able to reproduce this, in any case I will push again the tags.
Thanks
Marco
