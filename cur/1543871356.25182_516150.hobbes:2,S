+1 as a stupid user I don't see the point of blocking a perfectly fine
driver because a better solution may happen someday (the proof is in the
pudding and people may still find stopper problems when coding it). At the
pace things are going the hardware will be end of lifed before this
solution happens.
Li Yu first drivers messages have more than a year now! Is the driver so
invasive it couldn't be deprecated later?
(also there is the slight problem of teaching X to accept > 255 keycodes,
which won't happen till there are popular drivers linux-side emitting
them)
