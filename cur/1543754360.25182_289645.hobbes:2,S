It would slow down the groups case (unless we leave the specialized version 
in). Gcc doesn't inline a cmp function pointer, and a C preprocessor 
templatized version would be really ugly. A variant with of this routine with 
qsort like interface should be good enough for nfsacl and xfs though.
Nevertheless, xfs and nfsacl have very similar requirements:
nfsacl: at most 1024 elements; 8-byte elements (16 on 64-bit archs)
xfs (from Nathan): at most 1024 elements (with 64K blocksize); 8-byte or 
larger elements
Cheers.
