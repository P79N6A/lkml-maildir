The 2.2.19 version doesn't do anything on timeout (except print a message
that it is resetting, which it isn't :). The driver has a few changes
during the 2.4 series:
2.4.3 was patched to actually reset things on tx_timeout, but that also
changed the startup sequence.
2.4.6 got changes to reload certain things from eeprom when the driver is
loaded (fix a problem with booting from win98 that does a power down).
2.4.7 changes to the transmit code to use "singlecopy" for unaligned
buffers.
2.4.8-acX fixed a bug in the startup code from 2.4.3
Testing the 2.4.2 and 2.4.3 drivers could give something (should work to
simply copy the drivers/net/via-rhine.c from the different versions into a
2.4.9 source tree).

Good (that you have a reliable way to trigger this). For about how long do
you need to run this?

Depending on the sort of access you have, you could test unplugging
everyone else and repeat the 'ping -f' test.
I don't have the hardware to test now, but when time permits ...
