Not sure who wrote the above, but it contains a glaring legal error:
Developers choose an invalid forum to impose licence conditions when
they choose to do so via EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL.  The licence that prevails
is GPL, and nowhere does it say that protected works may only be used by
other GPL works.  In fact, such a notion is alien to the GPL.

Of course courts are the proper forum to decide "fact" from opinion, but
a statement of claim, which is a necessary preliminary to such an
action, must state from what the alleged offending work is derived.  The
fact that claim of violation is made before any violating work has been
identified, or even created, does work against such an action.  A 
half-decent lawyer should be able to have any such action dismissed on
that basis alone.
I wonder if it isn't fraud to offer a work under the GPL and then to try
to impose new conditions.
