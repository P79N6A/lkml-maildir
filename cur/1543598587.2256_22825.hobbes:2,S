It is by definition that way. 'slist' does not accept user name,
and lists all available IPX servers on the network, while all other
utilities require some server and user name, and works with specified 
server only. You can specify default server name and user name in ~/.nwclient 
file (man 5 nwclient), if you are lazy to type it.

P.S.: ncpfs is NOT tested with MarS
P.P.S.: I assume that you did all tests with "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/user2/
download/www/ncpfs-2.2.0.18/lib", otherwise tools used old system libncp
anyway.
