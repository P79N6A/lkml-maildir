2 remarks
1) it would make sense to keep track of "removed" interfaces as well
2) the per interface description needs a "depends on config option"
field; not all options are always there, but depend on a config option
to be set. It makes a lot of sense to mark these as such so that users
KNOW they have to deal with the interface not being there occasionally,
depending on the kernel.
