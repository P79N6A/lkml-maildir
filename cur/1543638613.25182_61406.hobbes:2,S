Neither.  It is a problem with CONFIG_DEBUG_IOVIRT which allmod and
allyesconfig turn on.  My builds stop at vmlinux and do not build
bzImage so I did not detect this problem.  The outb_p calls in misc.c
need fixing for CONFIG_DEBUG_IOVIRT=y, or force CONFIG_DEBUG_IOVIRT=n.
Interesting that the comment for CONFIG_DEBUG_IOVIRT says "Temporary
debugging check to catch old code using unmapped ISA addresses. Will be
removed in 2.4".
