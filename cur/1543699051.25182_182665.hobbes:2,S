You are right, Synaptics does check entire packet and reports it, 
unfortunately many (most) distributions kill almost all GPM messages
because it's too noisy.
Anyway, I wonder if the patch below will help sync problem. If it does
then we can kill the warning message later.
The patch should apply to -test11 although will complain about offset
as I have some extra stuff in my tree.
