Not a big deal -- all the produced config.outs are logically equivalent.
Your differences all consist of symbols saved out as n in one version and not
saved at all in the other.  It *would* be serious cause for alarm if that
were not the case.
The simplification in the saveability-predicate logic I just did for
1.9.8 made may help solve this problem.
