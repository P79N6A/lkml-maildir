LOTS there, which obviously isn't correct, but which I'll reply to later,
easier stuff first. (call this "handwaving" if you want, but don't worry,
I /will/ bother myself to reply)

Huh?
"If the (current) documentation doesn't match up with the (current)
code, then _at least one_ of them has to be (as of current) wrong."
I wonder how could you even try to disagree with that.
And I didn't go whining about this ... you asked me. (I think I'd said
something to the effect of GCC docs are often wrong, which is true,
but probably you feel saying that is "not allowed" on non-gcc lists?)
As for the "PR" you're requesting me to file with GCC for this, that
gcc-patches@ thread did precisely that and more (submitted a patch to
said documentation -- and no, saying "documentation might get added
later" is totally bogus and nonsensical -- documentation exists to
document current behaviour, not past). But come on, this is wholly
petty. I wouldn't have replied, really, if you weren't so provoking.
