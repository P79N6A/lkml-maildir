OK, I understand this.

Well, the confusing part is that fsck reports some size/count changes
(I don't remember the exact error message right now), something like
inode number x, was y, should be z, corrected. Now, if I write down
that inode numbers, and find corresponding files after fsck finishes,
they are in many cases corrupted (maybe in all cases?). I was always
wondering, what would happen if fsck DID NOT repair the files. After
all, it knows that older value.
Pardon my ignorance, I didn't found time so far to investigate inner
workings of ext2/fsck (even though I wanted).

I'm connected to a great, big UPS, so that in the last 2 years I
didn't have a single power failure. Nice, isn't it?
Now, what that UPS can't do is prevent me from "improving" kernel
sources and making mistakes along a way. If you by any chance get hold 
of a model with such functionality, please inform me fast where should 
I go and buy it. :)
