I'd like to have a way "lock" the keyboard. So that it isn't possibel to
write anything with the keyboard until a password or similar is entered.
I'd like the have such a feature because i don't want to log out of every
Console. (I login 10 times!) (Clue: Something like "CTRL-ALT-DEL, <ENTER>"
which locks the Screen/Keyboard under Windows NT. (One of the REALLY
usefull features i miss under Linux.))
Unlike Windows NT the Screen doesn't need to be blanked. I think it would
be usefull if changing VT (ALT-F1...) remain working, but nothing more.
I think this sould be implemented as a "Magic Sysrequst" which can better
entered "On-the-Fly" to lock the keyboard (Imagine how fast you can type
CTRL-ALT-DEL, <ENTER> and how long you need to logout 10 times! (And then
login 10 times!))
Bis denn
