   Dave, look, he says we will oops when sendfiling the last byte of a page,
   and will have to call skb_checksum().
It is true.  But his patch must be rewritten, bswap is forbidden
on older processors.
Better fix is to verify len >=2 before half-word alignment
test at the beginning of csum_partial.  I am not enough of
an x86 coder to hack this up reliably. :-)
