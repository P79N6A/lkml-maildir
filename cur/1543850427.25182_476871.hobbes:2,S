It's an unintended side effect of recent per-module-taint changes which
exposed the special nature of ndiswrapper & driverloader taints. Here's
where it went wrong:

That turns out to be true for every module under the sun except
ndiswrapper & driverloader which are singled out and treated
differently: their proprietary taint has nothing to do with their license.
Randy's patch looks like a reasonable compromise to get them going again
- the alternative being the reintroduction of license_gplok or some
equivalent per-module flag just to support 2 hardcoded exceptions where
GPL incompatibility and proprietary tainting are not correlated.
