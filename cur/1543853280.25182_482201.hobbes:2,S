Hummm as we are _writing_ to devices, I think that using /dev/sgXX with
SG_IO is better no?
... and the problem is not in accessing the device itself (this is
working like a charm) but understanding why a SCSI READ(10) cmd
sometimes fails as a ATA-padded READ(10) cmd - as discribed in the Annex
A of the MMC-5 spec - ALWAYS works.
-> I would suspect somehow a synchronisation problem somehow in the
translation of SCSI to ATA command...
Another point: When I say that a READ(10) fails, it does NOT mean that
the command execution itself fails. Everything works as if the command
exectution succeeds, but the resulting buffer contains garbage (i.e. not
only 1 or 2 bytes differs)
