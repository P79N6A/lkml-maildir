I'm doing some work where it would simplify things greatly to have 
copy-on-write semantics available.
I've seen overlayfs and the proposed "-union" option for mount,  but 
there doesn't seem to be anything thats really ready for serious use.
Am I missing something?  Is someone working on this?
Thanks,
Chris
