Well its a bit complicated due to the various configuration. UP, and then
more and more processors. Plus the NUMA stuff and the standard benchmarks
that are basically not suited for SMP tests make this a bit difficult.

Sorry but I still do not get what the problem is? kscrubd does exactly
what kswapd does and can be handled in the same way. It works fine here
on various multi node configurations and correctly gets CPUs assigned.
