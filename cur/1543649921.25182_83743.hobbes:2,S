Any suggestions on making this patch "more friendly" with 2.5.44-ac3?  
Apparently some of his patch mucked around in the timers source files as 
well as defining completely opposite macros in 
arch/i386/kernel/timers/Makefile.  I might of missed it, but I didn't 
notice anything in his changelog which would jump out at me, except for 
some of the Cyrix fixes.  I'm going to give it a shot, but I thought I'd 
ask as well.
Cheers,
Nicholas
