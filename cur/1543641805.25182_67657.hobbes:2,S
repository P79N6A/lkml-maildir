I did not test other block sizes. I just tested with the hardsect size
and noticed that that combo worked.

In kernels 2.5.13--2.5.32, it was always the case that with my hack,
a mounted ext2 would seem to work for a while and then break down,
e.g. when unmounted and fsck:d. I haven't checked 2.5.33.
Also, attempts to put lilo on ext2 on /dev/fd0 would throw the
kernel into an infinite stream of "buffer layer error!" from
buffer.c:__find_get_block_slow().
