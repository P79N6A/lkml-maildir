Subject: [PATCHSET 0/10] Time: Generic Timekeeping (v.C1)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Andrew, All,
	Here is an updated version of the smaller, reworked and 
improved patchset I mailed out monday. Please consider for inclusion 
into your tree.
Again, the majority of this new incremental design should be credited 
to Roman Zippel, but it is my implementation, so he gets the credit and 
I get the blame. :)
Summary:
	This patchset provides a generic timekeeping infrastructure 
that are independent of the timer interrupt. This allows for robust and 
correct behavior in cases of late or lost ticks, avoids interpolation 
errors, reduces duplication in arch specific code, and allows or 
assists future changes such as high-res timers, dynamic ticks, or 
realtime preemption. Additionally, it provides finer nanosecond 
resolution values to the clock_gettime functions. The patchset also 
converts the i386 arch to use this new infrastructure.
Changes since the C0 release:
o Cut out functions that are no longer used
o Re-arranged patch chunks so each patch makes more sense.
o Few small fixes.
o Improved comments.
On my TODO list:
o More attention on x86-64 and powerpc
o Re-add bits needed for inclusion into HRT and RT
o Try to restore cleanups via small patches
The patchset applies against the current 2.6.16-git.
The complete patchset can be found here:
