Hi Jörn,
I have been thinking about the problem that you describe, and, 
definitively, DualFS does not have that problem. I could be wrong, but, 
I actually believe that the GC implemented by DualFS is deadlock-free. 
The key is the design of the log-structured file system used by DualFS for 
the meta-data device, which is different to the design that you propose.

DualFS writes meta-blocks in variable-sized chunks that we call partial 
segments. The meta-data device, however, is divided into segments, which 
have the same size. A partial segment can be as large a a segment, but a 
segment usually has more that one partial segment. Besides, a partial 
segment can not cross a segment boundary.
A partial segment is a transaction unit, and contains "all" the blocks 
modified by a file system operation, including indirect blocks and i-nodes 
(actually, it contains the blocks modified by several file system 
operations, but let us assume that every partial segment only contains the 
blocks modified by a single file system operation).
So, the above figure is as follows in DualFS:
  Before:
  Segment 1: [some data] [ D0 D1 D2 I ] [more data]
  Segment 2: [             some data              ]
  Segment 3: [               empty                ]
If the datablock D0 is modified, what you get is:
  Segment 1: [some data] [  garbage   ] [more data]
  Segment 2: [             some data              ]
  Segment 3: [ D0 D1 D2 I ] [       empty         ]
This is very similar to what the cleaner does. Therefore, moving a direct 
datablock (D0) to a new segment does not require more space than in the 
original segment. That is, cleaning a segment in DualFS requires just one 
free segment, and not more.
The result is that you can use all the free segments in DualFS, and its 
cleaner is simple and deadlock-free. Probably the design is not the most 
space-efficient in the world, but it removes some other serious problems.
And, remember, we are talking about meta-data (which is a small part of 
the file system), and disk space (which is quite inexpensive).
