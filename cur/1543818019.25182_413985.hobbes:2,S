OK. But turning the promotion mechanism off completely (which is what 
setting the floor to the maximum) runs the risk of a runaway high 
priority task locking the whole system up.  IMHO the only SPA scheduler 
where it's safe for the promotion floor to be greater than MAX_RT_PRIO 
is spa_ebs.  So a better solution is highly desirable.
I'd like to fix this problem but don't fully understand what it is. 
What do you mean by a malloc-hog?  Would it possible for you to give me 
an example of how to reproduce the problem?

OK.  But it's important to realize that "nice" does not (in general) 
control the "amount of CPU" that tasks get with this scheduler.  It 
merely controls the order in which runnable tasks run i.e. it's a 
"priority based" interpretation of "nice" not an "entitlement based" 
interpretation.  The difference is important.
If you want a "bare bones" scheduler with an "entitlement based" 
interpretation of "nice" use spa_ebs with the maximum bonuses set to 
zero.  In that state spa_ebs is safe for promotion to be completely 
disabled unless you also want to use cpu caps (in which case you'd need 
to set the floor to about 137 to make sure that capped tasks don't get 
completely starved).

Thanks,
