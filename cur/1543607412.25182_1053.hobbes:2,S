Obvious fix: prohibit hard links across tree quota boundries,
including any that might be created by a rename.
It is an admin error to enable tree quotas on trees that
have existing hard links.
While doing that, a sysctl or mount option to enable/disable hard
linking to other people's files would be nice. Default to stopping
the "feature" IMHO.
