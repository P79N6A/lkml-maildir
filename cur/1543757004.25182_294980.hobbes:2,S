Thanks for follow up Kurt.  I'm travelling at the moment so bear with me
if my response time is slow.  In short, I don't mind switching over to
default capabilities and the consolidation of inline functions.  The
last optimization is pessimistic for case where module is in use, so let's
hold on that one at least as we work out any minor nits with the first
three patches.
thanks,
