It seems to me that the supplier is violating the GPL.
They've distributed a linux driver.
There are rare exceptions, but most linux drivers are considered
derived works of the kernel and must also be licenced under the GPL
(GPL 2.b).
As such, further restrictions on the rights that come with the driver
are prohibited (GPL 6.). Or, this may count as sublicencing, which is
also prohibited (GPL 4.).
So their licence prohibiting redistribution is in violation of the GPL.
Since no one else has commented on this, I'm wondering if I'm wrong.
Comments?
If I'm right, I believe that GPL 4. allows you to proceed with the
driver as per the GPL...

In my mind, this is exactly what the GPL is designed to prevent.
