2 x FC6 (2.6.19-rc6, 2.6.19-rc5-mm2) and some unstable debian (2.6.19-rc5).
$ rpm -q udev hal
udev-103-2
hal-0.5.8.1-4.fc6
$ dpkg-query -W udev hal
udev    0.100-2.1
hal     0.5.8.1-1
Not even init=/bin/bash helps (userspace doesn't seem to be involved).
Do you need some other info?
I don't know, if you got my previous e-mail, could you confirm this one?
thanks,
