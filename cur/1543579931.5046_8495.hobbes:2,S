Does anybody have a clue about what is different with xmms?
Does it use KNI if it can, for example? We used to have a problem with
KNI+Athlons, for example. 
It might also be that it's threading-related, and that XMMS is one of
the few things that uses threads. Things like that. I'm not an XMMS
user, can somebody who knows XMMS comment on things that it does that
are unusual?
