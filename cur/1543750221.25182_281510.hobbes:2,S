Correct - IDE lacks "disconnect" so when the bus is locked during
something like a CD verify during a burn you don't get access to the
other device.

  Put disks on the host first so they avoid the PCI bus overhead and

  Put CD burners on host if you can
  Use external controllers for slower stuff
