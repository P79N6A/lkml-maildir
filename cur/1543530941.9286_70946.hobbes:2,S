Or until they decide to give them back, or if they decide not to cash them
in before I am able to pay, I'm home free. This _does_ happen all the time
with memory, rarely are real IOUs given back (unfortunately). In any case,
not everybody giving out IOUs gets killed for it either...
OK, so _your_ application (and those of a few other people) demand this. So
why don't you pool up and hire somebody to get it to work like you want? If
it is really that important, this should be peanuts for you.
