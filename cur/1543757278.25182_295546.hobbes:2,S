Hi,
the new 2.6.11-rc series has another problem for me, my touchpad (Toshiba 
Laptop) stopped working. I guess this has to do with "[PATCH] ALPS touchpad 
detection fix" that was posted about 4 weeks ago. The kernel says while 
booting:
newton kernel: mice: PS/2 mouse device common for all mice
newton kernel: input: AT Translated Set 2 keyboard on isa0060/serio0
newton kernel: ALPS Touchpad (Glidepoint) detected
newton kernel:   Disabling hardware tapping
newton kernel: input: AlpsPS/2 ALPS TouchPad on isa0060/serio1
and when I try to use it, the following is spit out:
last message repeated 2 times
kernel: psmouse.c: TouchPad at isa0060/serio1/input0 - driver resynched.
kernel: psmouse.c: TouchPad at isa0060/serio1/input0 lost sync at byte 1
last message repeated 2 times
kernel: psmouse.c: TouchPad at isa0060/serio1/input0 - driver resynched.
kernel: psmouse.c: TouchPad at isa0060/serio1/input0 lost sync at byte 1
This goes on until I stop touching the touchpad. With up to 2.6.10 there were 
no problems and the kernel said:
newton kernel: mice: PS/2 mouse device common for all mice
newton kernel: input: AT Translated Set 2 keyboard on isa0060/serio0
newton kernel: input: ImPS/2 Generic Wheel Mouse on isa0060/serio1
I haven't compiled in any ISA support, but I don't think this can be the 
reason since I haven't changed the kernel config between 2.6.10 and 2.6.11.
Thanks for any help,
  Michael
