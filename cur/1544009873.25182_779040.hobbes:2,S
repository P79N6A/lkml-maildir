Well, the GPIO API fix is still not in clear sight, I took back
cs5535audio patches again to sound tree with the build workaround
like Andres posted (but with a proper fix of ifdef) for 2.6.29.
OLPC-dependent part won't be compiled in unless you have
CONFIG_MGEODE_LX=y, but it's still better than now.
This is really a workaround, and I hope the GPIO stuff will be
fixed in arch/x86 in a better way...
