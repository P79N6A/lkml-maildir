Those came by analogy with list.h, with list_head -> bio_list:
  #define LIST_HEAD(name) \
        struct list_head name = LIST_HEAD_INIT(name)
We could use something like INIT_BIO_LIST(bl) for that, but perhaps it would be
more readable always written out in full?
   struct bio_list bl = BIO_LIST_INIT;
