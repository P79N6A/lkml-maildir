	Thanks, Martin -- I wish I could test it.  As of -test11, the 
Adaptec/DPT I2O driver still doesn't build and I need that on this box. 
  I think I understand the error messages, but fixing them is beyond me. 
  It's obviously a known issue, so I don't think I can provide any new 
info on it.
	Too bad for me -- I'm really looking forward to trying it and stuff 
like the NAPI for the e1000!
Regards,
Ken Beaty
