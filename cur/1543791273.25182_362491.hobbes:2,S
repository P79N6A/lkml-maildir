Heh - I like the "mostly" ;)

What I'm getting worried about is the marked increase in the
rate of features and complexity going in.
I am almost certainly never going to use memory hotplug or
demand paging of hugepages. I am pretty likely going to have
to wade through this code at some point in the future if it
is merged.
It is also going to slow down my kernel by maybe 1% when
doing kbuilds, but hey let's not worry about that until we've
merged 10 more such slowdowns (ok that wasn't aimed at you or
Mel, but my perception of the status quo).

Over time, I don't think it can offer any stronger a guarantee
than what we currently have. I'm not even sure that it would be
any better at all for problematic workloads as time -> infinity.

I think it falls down if these higher order allocations actually
get *used* for anything. You'll simply be going through the process
of replacing your contiguous, easy-to-reclaim memory with pinned
kernel memory.
However, for the purpose of memory hot unplug, a new zone *will*
guarantee memory can be reclaimed and unplugged.
