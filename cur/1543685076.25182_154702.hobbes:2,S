I have not gotten any results from nmi watchdog (unable to get it working)
or serial console (I have found that the kernel has stopped responding to
DMA requests, as a sound playing at the time just loops at the size of the
DMA buffer).
However, I have found another way to trigger it.
Simply 
rmmod pegasus
while there is a configured interface on it, will cause the exact same
symptoms.
I intend to try various kernel versions when I can.
