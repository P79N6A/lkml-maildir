I've shared a lab bench with Penelope.  If she's at a school where she can
study proteomics and where she can get grant funding sufficient to buy a
"MEMS card,"  then all she has to do is talk to her departmental computer
support people.  That's why they exist, and why distributions exist -- so
that Penelope does not have to deal with this horribly contrived scenario.
