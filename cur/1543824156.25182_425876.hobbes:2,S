In reality, both batch and background are useful distinct concepts.  I 
think of a batch task as one that needs to be treated fairly (in 
accordance with its nice value) but for which fairness shouldn't be 
broken to give it a boost as you might for an interactive task or media 
streamer.  I.e. doing useful work but not interactive or a media 
streamer and the occasional long latency isn't a disaster.
Background tasks are ones where you don't care if they ever get any cpu 
:-) except as necessary to prevent priority inversion.
In my schedulers I generalize background to "soft cpu rate caps" with a 
cap of zero being the same as background.  I have patches to add both 
soft and hard cpu rate caps to the standard scheduler but I'm sitting on 
them until things settle down a bit.
Anyway, schedulers based on single priority arrays (such as staircase) 
are looking more attractive every day.  :-)
