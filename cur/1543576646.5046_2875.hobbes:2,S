Well, I  'fixed' this by changing above line to:
 		= { 0, 0, { 0 }, { 0 }, };
and repeating this change (deleting the braces) about 15 times in 2 or 3 other 
files of iptables. (patch available on request)
Of course gcc shouldn't die but issue a useful message if/when syntax rules
may have changed.
Apart from that and a hand-edited arch/alpha/vmlinux.lds that got some 
newlines wrong, the kernel compiled fine and is up for over a day now.
Though this is not intel but alpha (ev4 / AXPpci33).

I use iptables for masquerading my local ethernet and that works as expected
so far.
Thorsten.
