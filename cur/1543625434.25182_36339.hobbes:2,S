V7 unix had it. Thats where the "uarea" aka u. comes in. Its one of the
killer problems with Linux 8086 - on the 11 they could put the kernel stack
file handles and other process local crap into a swappable segment that
could also be swapped from the kernel address space. On the 8086 thats
trickier
