VESA Local Bus.  It was (in some sense) the predecessor of AGP.  We
treat it like ISA inside the kernel.  On x86, EISA depends on ISA, so
the dependency, while wrong, does not affect any x86 users who have an
EISA card.

I believe this will work for VESA and EISA cards, though not, indeed for
ISA cards.

That doesn't mean it doesn't have users ...
On the other hand, the u14-34f driver is supposed to be preferred to
the ultrastor drivers.  Only problem: it doesn't support the 24F card.
