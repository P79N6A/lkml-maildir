There is no such thing, but this is how you'd build a minimal SYSLINUX
floppy image (remove the -s for better performance but somewhat reduced
resistance to severe BIOS bugs):
	su
	dd if=/dev/zero of=floppy.img bs=1024 count=1440
	mkdosfs floppy.img
	syslinux -s floppy.img
	mount -o loop -t msdos floppy.img /mnt
	cp bzImage /mnt/linux
	umount /mnt
	sync
