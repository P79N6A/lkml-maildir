Subject: 2.4.0-testx: Small configuration script errors (ACPI/APM) in xconfig  ...possibly other configs too

Hello!
	When you say no to "power management" (CONFIG_PM) the script
(correctly) removes the configuration options ACPI support
(CONFIG_ACPI), and Advanced Power Management support (CONFIG_APM), BUT
then the configuration options that a no to ACPI and APM normally
disables, gets enabled.
Wouldn't it be the correct behavior that a no to CONFIG_PM disables
everything that a no to CONFIG_ACPI and CONFIG_APM disables?
	Regards,
		Dennis
