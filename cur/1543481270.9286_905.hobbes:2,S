Windows NT magazine also ran an article stating all Linux programs had to
distribute their source. In the same article, they mention Oracle,
Informix, and Corel porting. So where do I download Oracle 8 source?!?
The Win NT writers either aren't bright enough to understand the LGPL,
or they're deliberately spreading misinformation.
Either way, I can't imagine any group of people less qualified to comment
on the Linux kernel.

I believe these complaints may apply to the 2.0 kernel, due to kernel wide
spin-locks, but not 2.2

This I don't believe. What would be the point of SMP support if it only
used one processor at a time? So either they're looking at a kernel prior
to SMP, or they have no idea what they're talking about. Or possibly, I've
misunderstood the statement.

I'm by no means a kernel expert, but I didn't see any other responses.
Anyway, I might be wrong.
