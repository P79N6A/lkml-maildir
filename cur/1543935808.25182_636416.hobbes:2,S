Attributes are supposed to be in force all the way from the bus domain
to the CPU domain.  That means that all of the strange busses you
traverse are theoretically part of the same attribute: The PCI spec
doesn't let you re-order just because you traverse the hypertransport to
get into the CPU domain if you're spec compliant, the hypertransport has
to enforce the same ordering as PCI.

I don't believe I said a bus attribute wouldn't be per mapping.  Most
PCI attributes are set per transaction.  The correct paradigm for us
looks to be per device per mapping ... which is correct .. it's from the
CPU to the device regardless of busses traversed.

My main objection is the direction overloading ... given the number of
potential attributes we run out of bits fast.
However, given that very few device drivers want actually to modify the
attributes away from the default, I think all you need is an opaque
attribute structure
struct bus_attribute;
methods for initialising and setting it
struct bus_attribute attr = BUS_ATTRIBUTE(blah|blah);
bus_set_attribute(&attr, blah)
and a *new* API for taking it.
dma_map/unmap_sg/single_attr()
That way, we can support virtually any weird and wonderful attribute and
because it's done by an opaque structure, we can never run out of bits.
This will work both for the altix bus and the PCIe bus (and any other
future bus type).
Also, there can be a generic implementation of the _attr() calls, so
only architectures actually implementing them need be updated.

Yes, I understand the reasons, I just want the API to suit non-altix.

Actually, no ... there'd just be an even weirder attribute, I suspect.
The attributes will be set per *transaction* not per bus.  A transaction
is an operation (DMA, PIO, config space, etc) from the actual bus to the
CPU.  It doesn't matter how many physical bus segments this traverses
and whether they're different bus types; all that matters for the
attributes are the characteristics that are CPU visible.
