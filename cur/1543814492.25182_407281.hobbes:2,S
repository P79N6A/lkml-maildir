This is a bug.
I will fix that for 2.6.17.

make kernelrelase shall work in both a read-only environment and shall
avoid modifying files when run as another user.
So the simple measure was to error out only if .kernelrelease was
missing.
The trick here seems to print $(KERNELVERSION)$(localver-full)
but only if .kernelrelease is present.
On the other hand if .kernelrelase and $(KERNELVERSION)$(localver-full)
differ then what to print.
The kernelrelease of the kernel or how it is configured?
echo -sam > locelversion does NOT change the kernel.
The kernelrealse of the kernel is only changed after running 'make'.
And this is what we want to see - the kernelrelase of the kernel, not
what happes to be stored in a file after the kernel was compiled.

Thanks. Will be fixed.
