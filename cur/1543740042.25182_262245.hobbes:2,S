No, it wouldn't.
The time has come to fix it properly instead. Anything which these tools
actually need from the kernel headers should be moved into a separate
header file (still in the kernel source) which is usable from _both_
kernel and userspace. It should use standard types (like uint16_t etc)
instead of kernel-private types, and shouldn't have any #if{n,}def
__KERNEL__ in it. Ideally, it would be in a different directory too --
but we can worry about that later.
