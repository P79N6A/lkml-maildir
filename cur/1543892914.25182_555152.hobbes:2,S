Somewhere down the line of lock_acquire()->register_lock_class().
It is then stuck onto the all_lock_classes list in mark_lock(). However
this would be a very bad place to run init code, since percpu_alloc()
can schedule and we're in the middle of a locking primitive :-)

Yes, it is possible to clear the task list, however that part of lockdep
is a tag fragile - look for the call-chain leading to zap_class().
