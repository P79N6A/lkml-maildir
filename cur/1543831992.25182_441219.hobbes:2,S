Mostly.  Except for the part where you have to figure out the stepping
of the processor connected to the memory controller to properly decode
the registers.  AMD should have used the revision field in pci config
space but...

I agree it should be that simple. 
But if all of your drivers are not that simple it doesn't make sense
to put half of them in user space and half of them in the kernel,
unless there is a good reason for them not to be in the kernel.
