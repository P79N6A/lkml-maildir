Actually the patch posted doesn't have the fix, it says:
+               case WIN_WRITE:
+               case WIN_WRITE_VERIFY:
+               case WIN_WRITE_BUFFER:
+               case CFA_WRITE_SECT_WO_ERASE:
+               case WIN_DOWNLOAD_MICROCODE:
+                       args->handler = &task_out_intr;
+                       return IDE_DRIVE_TASK_RAW_WRITE;
The fixed version returns TASK_INVALID.
