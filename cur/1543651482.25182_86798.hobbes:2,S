There a couple of kinds of flash memory that have different properties 
in the writes...
The one I'm more familiar with allows you to change any '1' bit to a '0' 
bit on a bit-by-bit basis, but it is, ehm, a tad slow.  But if you want 
to change a '0' bit to a '1' bit, you have to erase a 16 or 32 kB block 
to all '1' bits, and that is, well, very slow.
(Storing 'jiffies' in flash, given that updating the jiffies would take 
multiple jiffies would be, well, 'fun'. ;) I could, however, see some 
sense in running the read-only parts of the kernel directly from flash...)
It's been a while since I looked at read times, but I expect it to be 
essentially memory speeds.

Just an FYI, in case you're curious.
