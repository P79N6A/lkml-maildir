Times change, the XFS issues have been resolved.

This is called FUD.  If you have examples of a problem go ahead and post
them.   *EVERY* change made to the kernel has the potential to cause a
problem.   But this one has been carefully scrutinized and it seems that
only people with general notions of FUD remain to object.   Nobody seems
to have any real objections any more.  YAY!

So what?   The point is that if you compare the world from what it was a
few years back with just 8K, now there is just as much stack space,
although it happens to be split in half.

Of course.   If there are problems discovered in -mm with 4K stack (highly
unlikely since its been in production use on several vendor kernals for a
few years) they will be dealt with.   But once a reasonable period of time
has passed with no issues, its time to move it into mainline.
