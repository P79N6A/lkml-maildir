Do I understand you correctly? You deliberately want to move it
to BROKEN to cause pain in the hope of forcing somebody other than
"the person who did the kernel change in the first place" (quote
stable_api_nonsense.txt) to do the fixing up?

Not true. None of the past kernel API changes were done by someone
who had all the hardware for the affected drivers. I have personally
acked changes to the driver I maintain from people who don't have
the hardware, and the changes were fine. The one inventing a new
kernel API to replace an old one is in the best position for actually
replacing it in the existing users of the old API, and that's also
what stable_api_nonsense.txt stipulates.

I did grep for "BROKEN" in the 2.6.21-rc7 sources and couldn't find
an instance of a driver that was still in active use being broken in
order to make general progress. OTOH I remember several cases of
drivers being kept alive even though they were in the way of
progress, because there were still users relying on them.

You are turning the situation on its head. I4L works. Somebody wants
to push through a kernel API change that would break it. In every
other case I know, it was the responsibility of those doing the
kernel API change to fix the in-tree users of that API. As long as
they didn't finish that job, the old API would stay. Nobody advocates
moving reiserfs to BROKEN for still using lock_kernel(), to cite a
recent issue. So why isdn4linux?
