I've seen something similar on Seagate ST313021A IDE drives.
After a few minutes their read throughput falls from 20
megs/sec to about 5.  Issuing *any* drive-setting command
brings the throughput back.  Even a command which the disk
doesn't support.
So I have a cron job which runs `hdparm -A1' once per minute.
