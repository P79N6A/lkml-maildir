I don't understand this. Why would you need the "."? And why the /
between passwd and [ ?
I would prefer (as was suggested earlier in the thread) that the syntax
for the entry for joe in the passwd file should be
/etc/passwd/joe
and the if you want to select joe's full name, then it should be
/etc/passwd/joe/fullname
and it would result in e.g. "Joe Smith" and
/etc/passwd/joe/shell
whould be the shell joe uses.
Of course something would have to tell the system that the passwd file
has one line for each user, and that fields within a line are separated
by ":"s and what the names of the fields are (e.g. the first field is
called "user"). And when you select inside the /etc/passwd file (or this
type of file) then the default interpretation of joe is that "user"
should be used to select the line.
So by default, /etc/passwd/joe should be equivalent to /etc/passwd[user
= "joe"]
But you should be able to select based on fullname too:
/etc/passwd[fullname = "Joe Smith"]
and
/etc/passwd[shell = "/bin/bash"]/user
should give you the user names of all users whose shell is /bin/bash,
right?

I don't really see the point of this . = "passwd" syntax.

I think so.

but isn't that just /etc/passwd ? why complicate it?

no, I think it should be 
cat /etc/passwd[shell = "bin/tcsh"]
why the *? and why the @? an attribute? why not simply a part of the
line with / ?

I would say
echo -n "/bin/bash" > /etc/passwd[shell = "/bin/tcsh"]/shell

Yes, that is exactly what I am suggesting, except that I would like to
extend the POSIX syntax by stealing some useful syntactic bits from
XPath.

yes, but where is the username? that would be the first one listed here,
