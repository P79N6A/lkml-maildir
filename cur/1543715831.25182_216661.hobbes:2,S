How nice of them.
Well, AFAICS that means
	a) either kernel side of the things or the userland tools should
printk/syslog - at least that evms device had been set up
	b) any distribution that runs this from initrd/init scripts would
better take care of having sane fstab.
	c) nobody sane should put that as default.  Oh, wait, it's gentoo
we are talking about?  Nevermind, then.
