Hi,
What kind of distribution are you using ?
I have the same problem on a debian potato system, kernel 2.3.19...
I think this is distribution related,
at boot & shutdown time an init script called
hwclock.sh is called and it seem to be part of the problem...
bye

        It is well known that M$ products don't call free() after a malloc().
        The Unix community wish them good luck for their future developments.
