Might make it per-cpu instead, and set a bit in the mutex when 
scheduling out so we know not to remove it from the list on unlock.

It may be better than O(n) cpus banging on the mutex for the lock 
duration.  Of course we should avoid walking the part of the list where 
non-spinning owners wait (or maybe have a separate list for spinners).

I'll read up on those, thanks.
