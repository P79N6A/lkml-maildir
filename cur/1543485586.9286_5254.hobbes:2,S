has anybody considered indexing options or text in make menuconfig to make
it easier to find/relocate options ? i know there's a good organised
topological heirarchy eg "file systems", "sound" etc but what if one where
to search for CONFIG_SKB_LARGE, or anything with "ramdisk" in it ?
there should be hyper text links to cross reference parts of the kernel
instead of saying "make sure you answer Y to proc file systems
above/below" etc and macros to keep record of visited menus.
