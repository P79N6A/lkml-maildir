Hi,
I have a mp3 player Digital MP3/WMA PLAYER using USB1. With kernel 2.6.9 
when plug the device ; the kernel recognize the device
dmesg show:
usb 1-1: new full speed USB device using address 3
But loading usb-storage ; it did not see the device
dmesg shows:
SCSI subsystem initialized
Initializing USB Mass Storage driver...
usbcore: registered new driver usb-storage
USB Mass Storage support registered.
of course nothing happend if I mount /dev/sda1 or /dev/sda etc..;
With kernel 2.6.8 or 2.4.XX it works properly. Last time I tried with 
2.6.10 and even 2.6.11, it did not work, but the error message is different.
I am willing to help to debug the problem if asked.
Kind regards,
Steve Kieu
