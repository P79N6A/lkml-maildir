We have really nice ways of handling these things, so we should just use 
them.
For example, you can do
	static inline void read_cr4(void)
	{
		unsigned long cr4;
		alternative_input("xorl %0,%0",
				  "movl %%cr4,%0",
				  X86_FEATURE_CR4,
				  "r" (cr4));
		return cr4;
	}
and then just add that feature-flag discovery early on in boot (it needs 
to be pretty early, since the alternative instruction rewriting happens 
early).
We have several "calculated" features already. Things like X86_FEATURE_P4 
etc.
