And my coverage of creep in other _commonly used_ parts of the kernel
would then be nil. Given that allyesconfig can't be expected to build
a kernel on any given day, defconfig is the least arbitrary and most
useful of arbitrary choices.

defconfig is not an unreasonable approximation of features people use. 
If something is added to defconfig, odds are that people will start
using it. Not perfect, obviously, but I've yet to see anyone suggest
anything else that actually provides some coverage.
