Folks,
I don't have different Liunx release handy.  I got feeling that for
different version of Linux, device driver module has to be comipled under
that version in order to be loaded in.  In another word, driver compiled
under Linux 2.2.5-15 will not be loaded to other version of Linux, say
2.2.18 or 2.3.1.
Is my assumption correct?
Thanks!
