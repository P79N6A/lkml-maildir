Sorry, I fail to see the point.  The CPUTIME stuff will either way be
entire implemented at userlevel.  If we use TSC, we compute the
resolution from the CPU clock speed (no need to comment, I know it's not
reliable everywhere).  If we fall back on realtime, we will simply in
glibc map
   clock_getres (CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID, &ts)
to
   clock_getres (CLOCK_REALTIME, &ts)
The kernel knows nothing about this clock.
The comment changes are OK, of course.
If there is more to change this is in glibc.  So far I have not heard of
anybody wanting to use the clocks this way.  This is why we do not have
the fallback to realtime implemented.  If you say you need it I have no
problem adding appropriate patches.
