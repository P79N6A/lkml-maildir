"robust" mutexes isn't a new thing, so I assume Ingo didn't think he 
needed to post the whole rationale.
Consider a group of tasks that want to use a mutex to control access to 
data.  If one of them dies while holding the mutex, the state of the 
data is unknown and the mutex is left locked.
The goal is for the kernel to unlock the mutex, but the next task to 
aquire it gets some special notification that the status is unknown.  At 
that point the task can either validate/clean up the data and reset the 
mutex to clean (if it can) or it can give up the mutex and pass it on to 
some other task that does know how to validate/clean up.
You want the speed of futexes if possible.  You want to keep running. 
You just want to know that the data protected by the mutex may not be 
self-consistent.
