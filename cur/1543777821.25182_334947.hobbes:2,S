please take me off the Cc: list for such kind of replies. Christoph is 
very much entitled to his opinion, which i happen to mostly share in 
this case: we should not be bothering upstream with requirements unique 
to PREEMPT_RT. PREEMPT_RT restricts struct semaphore to be a mutex, and 
that doesnt make it a classic semaphore anymore. We had no other choice 
but it's still somewhat unclean in that regard.
(I do disagree with Christoph on another point: i do think we eventually 
want to change the standard semaphore type in a similar fashion upstream 
as well - but that probably has to come with a s/struct semaphore/struct 
mutex/ change as well.)
