Most of the time I spent on Linux development is in a 80xsomething so
I support the effort to make it fit into 80 coloumn.
But only if done sensible and not as a hard rule. Some stuff really
is less readable if it is adjusted to fit into a 80 coloumn.
I do not support tabifying the Makefiles. In a makefile <tab> has
a special interpretation and the rule of thumb is:
1) Use tab to indent commands as make requires it
2) Commands spanning more than one line may be indented with tabs.
Avoid tabs in all other places.
This is not the same ruleset as used in the .c source but the difference
here is that an assignment is not turned into a command in .c code
just because it is prefixed by a tab.
At present I'm fed up with day time job that is almost around the clock
time job. It will take a month before I will be active in kbuild area
again so please be patient. If something really urgent shows up I
can act - but just not much time to do so in.
