Thanks for the explanation. So the conclusion is that ACPI-cpufreq can reduce power consumption by lowering cpu frequencies, and p4-clockmod can hardly save power because CPU frequences are not changed.
My experiments do not consider power consumption. It only requires to slow down the speed of some cores by either reducing frequencies or clock modulation. In such case, p4-clockmod is still a good choice for me. Can anyone give me some hints on whether p4-clockmod works on Xeon quad-core processors, and how to get it work?
Thanks!
