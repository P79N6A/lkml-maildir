Yeah.  I've checked the docs, I think I know what's going on.  On one
hand, if the chipset is configured to have the range somewhere, it is
decoded before anything external to the chipset, be it ram or mmaped
i/o.  So the information you get from the chipset should not be able
to conflict with anything by definition, it's the anything that
wouldn't be visible.
But in your case of a f0000000-ffffffff mapping, something else
interesting is going on: it's conflicting with other internal
registers of the chipset, which, being fixed address, probably have
priority.  So you probably have to either reduce the range so that the
chipset registers aren't touched, or drop mmconfig if the address is
f0000000.
Technically, we can have the exact same problem with the other
chipsets.  BIOSen suck.
  OG.
