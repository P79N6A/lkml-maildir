You have to look all over the place. :(
And I've probably missed some of them.
But if the system if using PICs, they will be XT-PIC.
Edge or level triggered is then determined by the bus type:
ISA is mostly edge-triggered (OK, I can't remember that far back)
and PCI is defined as level-triggered.  However, there are
exceptions.  IIRC, legacy IDE is edge-triggered even if it is
on a PCI bus (see listing below for ide0).  And some legacy
devices are edge-triggered (timer, keyboard controller/8042,
parallel port).
You can find info about specifics in places like Intel
chipset specs (ICH5, ICH6, ICH7, etc.), the (large) ACPI
spec from www.acpi.info, the Multiprocessor (MP) spec.
from developer.intel.com, probably some AMD chipset specs,
some PCI bus specs, and in some Linux kernel source code.
Like I said, I probably missed a few places.
If you have a specific issue/problem, it would probably be
better just to focus on that.
