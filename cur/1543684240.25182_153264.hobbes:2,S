One thing strange though.
root     tty1                          Thu Jul 31 07:32 - 07:32  (00:00)    
reboot   system boot  2.6.0-test2-mm1- Thu Jul 31 07:31          (02:58)    
amnesia  pts/0        :0.0             Thu Jul 31 01:08 - crash  (06:23)    
It seems that I can still receive emails when the box freezed.
As we can see, I didn't logoff for 6+ hours... but i can't ping,
can't ssh, can't revive the box.
