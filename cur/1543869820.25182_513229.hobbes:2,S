Just a few comments & questions...

I would s/final/first/ since one could put many (unneeded) NULL pointers

Last sentence is actually 2 sentences, so (e.g.) change the comma
to a semi-colon, xor begin the sentence with "Since".
How does the kernel return an error if the ring buffer is full?
Just a syscall negative error return code?

init_atom() (was) above.  sys_async_exec(), sys_async_wait() are
new syscalls.  What are async_head_init() and async_head_exit()?
