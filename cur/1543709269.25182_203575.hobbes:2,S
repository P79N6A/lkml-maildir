You've been handed a clue enough times now that you should understand
that poll_wait() does not, and has never, put the process to sleep.
If you can show a case where do_poll() returns stale data, then by all
means do so. We will be happy to fix any such error in the kernel.
You say do_poll() looses the status returned from your driver's poll
method. If your driver is truly returning a nonzero status from the
poll() method call, then a simple read of the code in do_pollfd() will
show that the only way it looses information from that event mask is if
your user space is not setting that event type in pollfd.events.
If I were you, I'd check two things:
1) that your poll method is really returning a non-zero status when you
think it is
2) that your user space program is really asking for all events you
think it is
I think you'll find your problem is not this well-used mechanism in the
kernel.
