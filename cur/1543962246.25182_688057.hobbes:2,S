CONFIG_HOTPLUG is only settable to 'n' if you're CONFIG_EMBEDDED which
has a zero set intersection with the users of megaraid, so in practical
terms, there's no actual box it could kill.
this whole 
#if CONFIG_PM
define suspend resume
#else
set suspend resume methods to null
#endif
Is completely analagous to what we used to do with CONFIG_HOTPLUG before
we had the __dev.* sectional annotations.  Since the expanding
bureacracy is determined to keep the _dev.* sections in spite of the
pain, could we not at least make the machinery do something vaguely
useful and expand it to confine the pm routines to sections which can be
discarded if CONFIG_PM is n?
