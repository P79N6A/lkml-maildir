Hi Meelis,
> WARNING - broken Config.in!  CONFIG_PMAC was not declared!
Sigh, I know.
I can't turn it off until I know that every line in there is just noise.
Some lines were real bugs ("m was not declared!").
> This is on an x86. For 2.2.0 this should be turbed off IMHO.
This bug doesn't even begin to come close to "paper bag" importance.
There's a saying: "don't shake the jello".  (Everyone who has read the
actual xconfig changes in the pre-9 patch, feel free to laugh at the irony
of that.)  But I do mean it; I never send anything to Alan or Linus until
it's been through my testing pipeline.  That's why, even though I am
fixing the old bugs slowly, no *new* bugs are appearing in xconfig.
Also at this time, I am not bothering Linus unless xconfig corrupts
user files or opens security holes.  He has plenty to do right now.
I have plenty of time to submit patches to him for 2.2.1.
