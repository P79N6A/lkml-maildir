Something other will broke :-)) It's not very different from other OS'es.
For example when Windows98 was out it was needed half year to fix our
filesystem (since error was in Windows98 kernel, not our code and we had no
sources of that kernel; in the end fix was added: one internal function was
intercepted and stightlty modified).

It's not how linux was created in first place and I'm doubt if it's superior
way.

It does not compile even on x86 platforms sometimes. Now what ? "If it'll broke
you'll have both parts". To me MTBF is MUCH more important then compilability
(and I had uptime measured in MONTHS even for development kernels!). I can
fix minor problems myself or I can wait for vendor for new "boxed" version of
kernel.

It's supported. Or you MUST use what your venrdor gave you or you are on your
own...

Great.

Linus does not compile kernel on Alpha. Linus is NOT support center.

Huh ? Who'll donate Linus all possible obscure platforms and pay him for it ???
Linus is NOT VENDOR. And NOT SUPPORT CENTER as well.

Lucky you :-))

There are was a lot of discussion on subject. But even if it's not part of
standard kernel it's part of most distributions anyway.

Which STABLE kernel it was ? If it was development kernel it's 100% Ok.

        Linux version 2.3 is a DEVELOPMENT kernel, and not intended for
        general public use.  Different releases may have various and
        sometimes severe bugs.

It's your problem. ALSA is in early development stage and is NOT supported
by ANY Linux vendor (AFAIK, anyway).

No. You must ask vendor or manufacturer to fix driver :-)

Still it's MUCH easier then to develop working driver for Windows where you
must use non-documented functions and fix errors in Windows kernel "on the fly".

This is development kernel as well. Why do you expect that this beast will
compile ?

What a problem ? You used some DEVELOPMENT version downloaded from net and
NOT SUPPORTED by your vendor ! Why are you complain about ANYTHING ?

It's WAY too much to ask. Or you use something from you verndor and have
support or you can play your own game. You can not have both in the same time.
It's REALLY REALLY hard task to clean out stuff enough for compileability
in all possible configurations. It compiled in configuration used by Linus :-)

I'll ask him to show the same with his OS kernel. Or just DDK driver will be
enough (there are quite a few drivers in non-compileable state :-)

You have choice: use 2.3 kernel and STOP COMPLAINING or use 2.2 kernel from
vendor and ask him for help.

This is simple test to find if this filesystem is still supported :-)

It's not how linux is developed. Especially for development kernels.
For stable branch is can be considered like a good goal though...

Just one simple problem: it will not work. WHO will write this file ? Linus
will not do for sure.
P.S. Summary: you can use Linux as "normal" vendor supported OS. In this case
do not download anything from ftp.kernel.org (or mirrors) and ask your vendor
about problems. Or you can use Linux is Linux way: with manual fix when needed
with latest non-compileable development kernels and so on. Or you can grab Linux
source, create new OS (Leitux?) and try to convince uses to switch to you OS ...
I'm not sure if you'll be very successfull though...
