Has your timer a free running counter and a match register based event
mechanism ?

the clock event stop only stops the event mechanism, it does not stop
the counter.
See arch/i386/kernel/hpet.c

Yes, it is correct. The generic timer code requests an event in the
future. It does not care, whether the hardware device can handle that or
not. So the clock event code limits the delta to the maximum delta the
device can handle. The interrupt fires and the generic timer code
reschedules the event with the remaining delta time.
