I guess you're asking about the IOP3xx stuff.
info as
mp<tab>
msec<tab>
gives all the details.  To summarise though:
	"a" or "#alloc" - the section is allocatable
	"x" or "#execinstr" - the section is executable
"ax" seems to be what Linus uses.  I used to use the long versions, but
changed to the shorter version - less characters to type, but still
fairly readable.  After all, you don't catch people trying to make ls
report stuff like:
file, user read write execute, group read execute, other read execute,
2 links, owner root, group root, 44 kibytes, modified xxxx, name "foo"
(or I hope you don't! 8))
