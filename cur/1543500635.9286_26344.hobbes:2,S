Hello,
I have observed a strange behaviour using cpio on a 2.2.10-ac4 SMP box.
strichnine is the SMP box.
dgps6 is a 2.2.10-ac4 UP box.
willy is a 2.2.10-ac4 UP box.
From dgps6, as root :
# rsh strichnine 'cd /usr; find . -depth -print | cpio -ovB' >/dev/null
The command ends up prematuraly (in the middle of X11R6). No log on either
machine.
# rsh strichnine 'cd /usr; tar cvf - .' >/dev/null
The command completes normally.
From dgps6, as root :
# rsh willy 'cd /usr; find . -depth -print | cpio -ovB' >/dev/null
The command completes normally.
To summary, a cpio on an SMP box sent to /dev/null through the network dies.
As a consequence, it is impossible to backup the SMP box using cpio.
