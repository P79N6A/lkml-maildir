Ok.  Tried it.  Same results:
/dev/hda:
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  8.50 seconds =  7.53 MB/sec
/dev/hdb:
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  6.31 seconds = 10.14 MB/sec
/dev/hdc:
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  7.39 seconds =  8.66 MB/sec
/dev/hdd:
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  9.50 seconds =  6.74 MB/sec

Just verified (I'm assuming you did mean CONFIG_PIIX_TUNING since that is
what is everywhere EXCEPT in Configure.help, where it does have
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_PIIX_TUNING).

Well, I do have those set up.  However, don't forget, I was getting regular
DMA errors with hdd.  Course, now I'm not seeing them with 2.2.15pre15
using my usual stress test of du -s on one of the partitions.  Hmmm...
Also, someone mentioned to me offlist that the 430VX is, well, a piece of
shit.  If it's just a crappy motherboard, I'm happy with that.  Or if it's
maybe just this harddrive acting up, I can live with that, too.  I just
wish I knew how to verify that it's either of those two situations as
opposed to something wrong in the kernel.  Alas, I don't have a duplicate
system to test on, though.
