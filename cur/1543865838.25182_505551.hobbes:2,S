Subject: [patch 0/3] 2.6.20 fix for PageUptodate memorder problem
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/2/6/35

Still no independent confirmation as to whether this is a problem or not.
I think it is, so I'll propose this patchset to fix it. Patch 1/3 has a
reasonable description of the problem.
Thanks,
Nick
