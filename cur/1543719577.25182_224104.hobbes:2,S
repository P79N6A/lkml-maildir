I'm not really sure what the above was intended to demonstrate, but I assume
that it was that having swap allowed the first grep to fill physical RAM with
cache at the expense of swapping other processes, which were using physical
RAM to disk.
However, if 57 Mb of swap allows this, 57 Mb of extra physical RAM should also
also allow the grep to be cached, without having to swap out anything.
Hence my comment about it not being a magical property of swap space.
John.
