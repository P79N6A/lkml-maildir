Depending on how high quality randomness you need, you could just let
your NIC driver provide entropy by changing interrupt handlers to use
SA_SAMPLE_RANDOM.
Sure, getting entropy that way allows an outside attacker to influence
the pool if they can obtain a high degree of control over what data
you recieve and when, but in most realistic scenarios it should be
acceptable (and it's certainly better than no entropy at all).
