I haven't heard that big complains about RH stability yet, but applying
random vendor patches increases Q&A costs - apparently RH seems to be quite
successfull with that business model anyway.

Why the heck should they waste ressources with backporting reiserfs fixes
if they don't support it?  If you care for reiserfs stability in RHEL send
them patches, that's what SGI did for XFS in Fedora Core 2.
