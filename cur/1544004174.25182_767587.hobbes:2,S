Were you using preemptible RCU earlier as well?  Raphael was using
classic RCU.  Don't get me wrong, all problems need fixing, just trying
to make sure I understand where the problems are occurring.

This hang also involved synchronize_sched()?  Or synchronize_rcu()?
The reason I ask is that the above stats are for the synchronize_rcu()
rather than synchronize_sched().
