Hmmmm.. Cannot see the corruption in the dump since it only includes 128 
bytes and it seems to have occurred way into the object. If you want to 
dump 32k to your syslog to see the corruption then look at the 
print_trailer() function and change the parameter of the call to 
print_section
	print_section("Object", p, min(s->objsize, 128));
This is a 32k sized slab and SLAB does not allow debugging on power of two 
slabs > pagesize.... No surprise that SLAB does not complain.
What are these functions "malloc" and "free"? Would be good if those 
would be using kmalloc_track_caller() so that we can figure out who called 
them.
