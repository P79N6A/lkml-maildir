I just had all 8 filesystems come up with:

On the second test iteration. On 2.6.16, it takes about 10 iterations to get one
filesystem to do this. I'll need to look into this one further. I'm going to
reboot the machine and run some dbench tests (which typically don't trigger
this problem) and then come back to this one with added debugging....
Cheers,
Dave.
