hehe, I did have NMI on the whole time. It's that I also had modifications
in try_to_wakeup, so seeing that in the backtrace, I thought I was the one
screwing up. But I was still certain that it was my code locking up.

Well, we have more than one problem if that is happening.

Actually, the code that did trigger it was part of the latency_tracer
code doing the wakeup latency timings. Theres a printk that happens when
we trigger the max latency, and it prints from the scheduler.
So this was perfect to lock up every time.
