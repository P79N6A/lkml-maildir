We need to store that this-page-got-reclaimed info somewhere.  I don't know
how space-efficient that is.  Did anyone ever do an implementation?
Of course, the pages need to be re-read again so there's a potential 100%
hit there, which is in fact not a huge amount in this context.  Depends how
often it occurs (all the time when refault is being useful?) versus what we
gain from it.

We have a communication problem here.  Please please please work harder to
get these problems communicated to the MM developers.  The only vendor MM
kludge of which I'm aware is a thing which Andrea is working on to address
a large-shm-segment versus bulk-IO problem (yup, database).
If you have enough of an understanding of a problem to be able to develop
and productise a fix then share that info madly, asap.
otoh, rhel-on-the-desktop-or-smaller probably isn't a huge priority, which
can be taken advantage of.

You mean design it and review the design before coding it?  You'll find few
objections there.
