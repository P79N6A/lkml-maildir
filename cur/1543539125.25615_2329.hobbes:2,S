I've seen several BIOSes that detect whether an 80-wire cable is plugged in
or not.  And when the 80 wire cable is not plugged in, the IDE is slowed
down to UDMA-33.  Perhaps these settings should be read from the BIOS if no
other way is known.  I'd also say to default to UDMA-66 as most motherboard
that ship with support for it also provide an 80-wire cable.
