If you turn V4L and V4L1_COMPAT off, most drivers won't compile.

Ok.

Hmm... tveeprom shouln't include videodev but, instead, videodev2.
Anyway, both aren't dependent of v4l2-dev.h. For bttv, it is not really
a complete V4L2 driver and should be disabled. You should also notice
that tvaudio is part of bttv stuff (although also not dependent of
video_device struct and v4l2-dev.h).

Partially agreed. We should move all in-kernel stuff to use
CONFIG_VIDEO_V4L1_COMPAT. For userspace, this flag might be interesting
(as well as his counterpart HAVE_V4L2).

Legacy stuff. HAVE_V4L1 came before the Kconfig flag.

Instead, we should do the opposite: checking for both flags inside
videodev.h. If no V4L1 or V4L1_COMPAT, it should just include
videodev2.h.

Agreed.

Perhaps I missed the point, but I can't see what else would be broken by
replacing the check.

Broken drivers for V4L2 only should be marked in Kconfig, just like
bttv. Of course, we should work to fix it. Nickolay did a patch in the
past removing V4L1 code from bttv and make it use v4l1-compat module
instead. We should work seriously on such patch.
Cheers, 
Mauro.
