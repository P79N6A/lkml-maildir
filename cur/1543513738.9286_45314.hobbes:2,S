But it doesn't. And BTW I know of at least two attempts to unify all the
lance drivers that failed. They have too many quirks. The 961a driver
is for a weird ARM onboard setup, lance.c is ISA bus with no local ram,
the SK_G16 and the NI drivers are differently arranged local ram setups
and the sparc lance driver has to deal with sun prom stuff and sparc VDMA
On the PCI side we have (thankfully) one driver.
