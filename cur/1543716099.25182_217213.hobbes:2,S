Correct. I'll send a patch which re-adds this call to 2.6.6-rcx.

The problem with this approach is IHMO that you need the i2c_client struct in
I2C chrip driver as well (to call the i2c access primitives). You'd need to
store the pointer to the client somewhere in the driver itself. What if we have
more than one client per driver?
IMHO the call i2c_get_client() is nice and clean. One could wish another call like
  int i2c_command( struct i2c_client *c, long cmd, void *arg );
whcih does a
  client->driver->command( client, cmd, arg );
internally.
