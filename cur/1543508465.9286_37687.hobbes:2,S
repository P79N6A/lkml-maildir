Brent:
this is a common enough problem. memory detect doesn't always work
properly, so you have to add and append line to lilo.conf. iirc (which i
probably don't), it'll be
image = /kernel_image
        root=/dev/root_device
        label=linux
	append="mem=128M"
in your lilo.conf. 
personal guess is bunk bios.
