It's true that this is a "feature" of ext3 with data=ordered (the default),
but I suspect the same thing is now true in reiserfs too.  The reason is
that if a journal commit doesn't flush the data as well then a crash will
result in garbage (from old deleted files) being visible in the newly
allocated file.  People used to complain about this with reiserfs all the
time having corrupt data in new files after a crash, which is why I believe
it was fixed.
There definitely are some problems with the ext3 journal commit though.
If the journal is full it will cause the whole journal to checkpoint out
to the filesystem synchronously even if just space for a small transaction
is needed.  That is doubly bad if you have a very large journal.  I believe
Alex has a patch to have it checkpoint much smaller chunks to the fs.
Cheers, Andreas
