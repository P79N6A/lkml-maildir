Seems people are guessing that something's corrupting ext2fs in
2.2.{9,10}.  Well I've been running 2.2.3 on a machine non-stop
since the kernel came out, and never saw a problem.
However, because of a power loss, the machine was booted, checked
the filesystems, re-synced the RAID-5, and during the reconstruction
I saw this:
EXT2-fs warning (device 09:00): ext2_free_inode: bit already cleared for inode 9110618
This happened while the RAID was reconstructing (so there was quite some
disk activity).  Never seen it before, never seen it after.
Could be we have an issue with more of the 2.2 series ?
Hope this helps someone.
