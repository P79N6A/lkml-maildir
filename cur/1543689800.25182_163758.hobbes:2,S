My concern is the (large) performance regression with specjbb and
volanomark, due to increased idle time.
We cannot just jam all this code into Linus's tree while crossing our
fingers and hoping that something will turn up to fix this problem. 
Because we don't know what causes it, nor whether we even _can_ fix it.
So this is the problem which everyone who is working on the CPU scheduler
should be concentrating on, please.
