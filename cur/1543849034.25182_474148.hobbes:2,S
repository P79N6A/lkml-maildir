No driver needs nested blocking, but blocks may be imposed on a driver's
device by the PCI core, for example.

I don't think that's necessary.  Right now, we have one user (IPR's
BIST) and I'm trying to add a second (D-state transitions).  We don't
need nested blocks, but we do need to fail in the highly unlikely case
someone tries to do them.
If it turns out we actually need them later, let's revisit this when we
have a user.
