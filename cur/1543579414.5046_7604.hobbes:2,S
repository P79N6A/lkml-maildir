I see.
Is this strong "no-no-no"? What is obstacle to allow "struct page"
to sit outside of mem_map (in some private table, or as full orphan)?
Only bloat of struct page with reference to some "page_ops" or something
more profound?

I do not see too, but documents are pretty obscure explaining this.
MRM seems to be prohibited for pci-pci. But my education is still not 
enough even to understand, whether MRM is required to burst
or this is fully orthogonal yet. 8)
