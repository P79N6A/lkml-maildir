I see. Thanks.

Yes. However, if machines uses buggy chip, I guessed TSC/PIT would be
more proper as time source. But probably you are right, timer_pit.c
seems more slow usually (it uses many I/O port).
I'll remove unlikely(), and also will remove "Use other timer source"
from warning.
BTW, this patch is still quick hack.
At least, we would need to check the ICH4 which says in comment.
However, I couldn't find the PM-Timer Errata in ICH4 spec update.
Do you/anyone know about a ICH4 error?
