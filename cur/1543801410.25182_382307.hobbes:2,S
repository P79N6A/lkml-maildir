Would also make it easier to rank it as a percentage, or group by
locality of reference to other functions, rather than just a binary
split of "rare" vs "not-rare".
Of course it's all very dependant on workload, which drivers you're 
using too, etc, etc. So a profile that's separate also makes it much
easier to tweak for one machine than the source base in general, which
theoretically represents everyone (and thus has little info ;-)).
Which also makes me think it's easier to mark hot functions than cold
ones, in a more general maintainance sense.
