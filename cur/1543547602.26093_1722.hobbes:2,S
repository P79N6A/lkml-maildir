True, however I would expect that moving a file is easier than applying a
patch (if he applies a patch then he'll probably want to eyeball it to make
sure it's not obviously wrong - stallion.c would make a reasonable sized
patch).
Anyway I have just been informed that the file has already been moved in the
pre-test8 patch.

That sounds logical, I have attached a patch that does that change and
changes serial.c (the code I copied from) in the same fashion.
Linus, please merge this in the next test release.
