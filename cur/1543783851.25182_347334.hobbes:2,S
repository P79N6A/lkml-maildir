Exactly where it is.  It's there because of the problem you allude to
above - it's there to catch up system time.  Any generic code can't
answer the question "how much time has passed since we disabled the
timer" without additional information.
However, we could change "handler" to be a function pointer which
returns the number of missed ticks instead, and then updates the
kernels time and tick keeping.  That would probably be more efficient.
