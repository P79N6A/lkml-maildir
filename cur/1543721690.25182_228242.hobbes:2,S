Really?  I see that one of the previous authors listed on your
copyright filing is Hugh Blemings, listed as "author of keyspan
support for Linux."  I will repeat my question: Did you really do
copyrightable work on the USB serial drivers yet somehow fail to
notice the many firmware header files already there?

They need not have stated it explicitly; they just have to have relied
on it.  People who are sent patches by the patch's author infer by
that submission that including the patch(es) will not lead to claims
of copyright infringement by that author.  This is common sense.  If
you have any example where someone rejected a patch from the patch's
author out of concern for copyright infringement claims by that
author, I'd like to see it.
There was recent in-depth discussion on debian-legal about further
reasons that would bar your claim of copyright infringement.  Since
you declined to answer all of what I wrote before, I will not bore you
by repeating those arguments here.
