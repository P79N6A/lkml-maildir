I added some printks to the calls that modify the timers (I have only one IDE
chain, so hwgroup->timer is always the same):
    'A' -> add_timer()
    'D' -> del_timer()
    'M' -> mod_timer()
and I catched these:
| DADADADMide_set_handler: timer already active 
         ^
| Apr  5 12:30:17 cassandra 4>Apr  5 12:30:17 kernel: MDADADADADADADADA
                                                      ^

                                                      ^
As you can see, there are two consecutive `M's. At all other places, you have
something like
| DADADADMDMDADADADADADA
         ^ ^
which is OK.
Then I added an `asm("illegal")' to force a stack backtrace:
Illegal instruction in

Nothing interesting, I'm afraid.
Since I also get `eth0: Re-entering the interrupt handler.' from the Ariadne
Ethernet driver, I brought the net down, removed the ariadne LKM and even
disconnected the UTP cable to make sure no interrupts would happen from the
Ariadne (Ariadne and IDE share the same interrupt), but I still get
`ide_set_handler: timer already active' messages...
