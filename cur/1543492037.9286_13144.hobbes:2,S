If you intend to use other fs than ext2, maybe. Create one from scratch, use your imagination and so on.
Or - yuck - use the ntfs support on linux - sucks big time.
AFAIK the US Navy does not intend to use Linux as its main network os (see the "stolen" Navy NT guide)
and I think it's no use to classify it as C2 or X3 or whatever. If you need a secure linux, then make it.
Anyone here who has (re)written the fs access function in order to encrypt data on hdd (you know, eliminating
the bootdisk and/or init=/bin/sh operations)?
