If the system is idle it doesn't cost anything to bring those pages in 
(laptop mode disables any prefetching if you're thinking about power 
consumption on laptops). And if the system wants the ram that has been 
filled with prefetched pages wrongly, the prefetched pages are at the tail 
end of the inactive LRU list with a copy on backing store so if they're not 
accessed they'll be the first thing dropped in preference to anything 
else, without any I/O.
