Where did I say it is a barrier because it sleeps?
It is always a barrier because, at the lowest level, schedule() (and thus
anything that sleeps) is defined to always be a barrier. Regardless of
whatever obscure means the compiler might need to infer the barrier.
In other words, you can ignore those obscure details because schedule() is
always going to have an explicit barrier in it.

No. If you accept that barrier() is implemented correctly, and you know
that sleeping is defined to be a barrier, then its perfectly clear. You
don't have to know how the compiler "knows" that some function contains
a barrier.

Sure, but there are well known primitives which contain barriers, and
trivial recognisable code sequences for which you don't need comments.
waiting-loops using sleeps or cpu_relax() are prime examples.
