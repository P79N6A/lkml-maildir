We already have this in .../include/asm-i386/div64.h.  Check usage in 
.../posix-timers.c to cover archs that have not yet included it in 
there div64.h.

You just need to do the right casting.  It should like 
u64=u32*(u64)u32  as in .../kernel/posix-timers.c.  This could also be 
signed with the same results.  If you really need to do a u64*u32, it 
will do that as well but takes two mpys.  In this case you will need 
to do it unsigned to eliminate the third mpy.
