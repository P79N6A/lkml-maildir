Subject: [PATCH 1/3] mmap: protect from stack expantion into low vm addresses
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/16/277

When adding the new security hooks into mmap to enhance protection
against NULL pointers in the kernel I overlooked that a user may be able
to expand the stack all the way down to low addresses.  This flaw was
pointed out by a PaX/grsecurity developer and this patch should provide
protection against this missed code path.

** Be very careful applying/rediffing this patch.  Standard 3 lines of
context from git diff will misapply the first hunk to expand_upwards
instead of properly in expand_downwards.  This patch was generated using
-U 4 to make sure it applies in the correct place.  **
