Hmm, I think that will take more time than just restoring the entire system
state.

Once you've frozen processes, the freezing of the rest of the system is
pretty straightforward.  Currently, we do a bit too much for that, because we
suspend devices instead of just quiescing them before creating the image,
bu that's going to change (I hope).

Sounds neat, but what about the processes that depend on the hardware
(like hal)?

Well, not that much less. :-)

Yes, that would be an advantege.

There's one more thing, I'm not sure if that's possible to separate the kernel
state from the processes state entirely (think shared memory, LRU lists,
situations in which the application has been frozen while waiting for an
event in the kernel space etc.).
