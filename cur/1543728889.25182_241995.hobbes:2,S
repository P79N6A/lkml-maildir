If I ever find time to look into it then my plan is to give
the user the possibility to see _all_ menus + symbols with a prompt.
And for all symbols with a promt and with dependency information
to let the user enable a pop up window giving the possibility
to select all "Depends on" symbols.
So consider:
config FOO
	depends on BAR
config BAR
	select BAZ
config BAZ
Then when pressing 'd' on the FOO symbol (which is marked
as invisible) the user will be prompted with:
CONFIG_FOO
Depends on:
CONFIG_BAR: [ ] "Prompt for BAR"
