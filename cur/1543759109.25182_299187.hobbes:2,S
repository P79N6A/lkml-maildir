Subject: [2.6 patch] make savagefb one module
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch links all selected files under drivers/video/savagefb/ into 
one module.
This required a renaming of savagefb.c to savagefb_driver.c .
As a side effect, the EXPORT_SYMBOL's in this directory are no longer 
required.
---
Other names than savagefb_driver.c (e.g. savagefb_main.c) are easily 
possible - I do not claim being good at picking names...
Due to the size because of the renaming, this patch is attached gzipped.
