Subject: Repeated system locks and "kernel bug" messages

I have a server that has been giving me fits for the past couple of 
weeks, with seemingly random lockups. The system is actually running to 
some extent, but cannot be rebooted, and things like top and ps do not 
run properly. System load will climb and climb too until the system is 
physicall rebooted.
I have gotten messages similar to the one below, each time. Todays 
crash was in a kernel call from mysqld. Other times it has been 
Courier-IMAP, or some other process. I am running a 2.4.20 kernel, as 
built by Redhat for Red Hat Linux 7.3.
Here goes:

serious situation. Ho

please report this
bug to

mailinglist.

Each crash has been at this line in memory.c.  I have had the RAM 
replaced, as I thought initially that it was a hardware problem. I am 
not so sure anymore.
Any help or advice is greatly appreciated! I am supposed to have a 
production web server going live on this box Monday, so if I need to 
replace it, this weekend is the time to do it.
Thanks!
