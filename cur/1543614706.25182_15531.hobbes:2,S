Hi everyone,
The new binutils in Debian uncovered a few bugs in the kernel, but I
have not yet seen anyone post a patch for the problem where building
sound with via82cxxx_audio set as non-modular fails with:
drivers/sound/sounddrivers.o(.data+0xb4): undefined reference to `local symbols in discarded section .text.exit'
make: *** [vmlinux] Error 1
Does anyone have a fix for this?
