We don't alter anything about what the other clients cache.  Sure, you can
connect to the same server with a client that doesn't have this fix, and
sure you might get different cached data on different clients at the same
time, but that's the current situation.  You don't make it *worse* for
anybody else, you make it *better* for Linux.

But "ctime and file size are the same" does not prove that the file is
unchanged.  That's the root of this problem, and why NFS_CACHEINV(inode) is
not enough to ensure coherency.
Furthermore, according to NFSv4, what I am suggesting is something that a
client "may choose" to do anyhow---i.e., it's at least permitted by the
spec, even if it's not required.

Yes, but my solution works for all servers with a Linux client. (We've been
making this modification to NFS clients in several other unices for years,
we know it works and gives the guarantees we need)

It's better to get wrong results if you run a mail client at the same time
on two different machines, right?
