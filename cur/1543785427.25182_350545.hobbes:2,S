The simplest way to achieve this is to:
a) Hack ntpd to "not notice" the leap-second announce bits 01 in
   the packet header and pretend they're actually 00.  This will
   make it not insert a leap second.
b) Run it with the -x flag so that it always slews the time.
The real solution would be to implement Markus Kuhn's UTS proposal
(
http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/uts.txt
), which is about the most
reasonable meshing of the expectation that there are 86400
seconds per day with the fact that there are not.
