I think you're right, objdump -d shows[1] _write_lock looks
something like:
      lock subl $0x1000000,(%ebx)
      sete   %al
      test   %al,%al
      jne    out;
      lock addl $0x1000000,(%ebx)
  out:
so I guess it 2+ CPUs grab a write-lock at once it would indeed be
less than zero (the initial value is RW_LOCK_BIAS which is 0x1000000
in this case).

on x86 aligned-reads will be always be atomic AFAIK?
[1] Yes, I'm stupid, trying to grok the twisty-turny-maze of headers
    and what not made my head hurt and objdump -d seemed easier.
