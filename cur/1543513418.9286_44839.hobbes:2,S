Your version appears to have the same bugs however and a whole pile more.
The actual changes are:
o	Cleaning out the optimise check which breaks debugging kernel builds
o	Using the new PCI resource structures
o	s/struct device/struct net_device
o	Removing some of the back compatibility ifdefs to make the code more
	maintainable in 2.3.x
Both versions of the via rhine driver 
o	Don't handle memory resources right with 2.3.x (ie 
	check_mem_region and friends)
o	Blindly assume kmalloc won't fail. Sane at boot maybe but not for
	a module load
o	Misdefine ioremap into vremap for Alpha
I've got a patch for the malloc  one but the check region stuff my fix
doesnt yet work
