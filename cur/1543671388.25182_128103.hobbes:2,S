People have indeed asked me to do that even for the BK tree - to avoid 
spammers picking up the address. I don't want to do it.
Personally, I want to have some address that I can reach the author at,
and if that means that spammers can pick it up too (open source means that
everybody has the same stuff _I_ have) I guess people who want to talk to
me need to live with spam filters or send patches to me from special 
accounts.
But both the short-format changelog (the ones posted to linux-kernel) and 
the CVS tree do hide the addresses somewhat.
