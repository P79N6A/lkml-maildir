Its the standard thing. You need to do a make mrproper and make depend to go
from UP<->SMP kernels. Its a bug in the makefiles and non trivial to fix.
Sometimes you may find that rm -rf include/linux/modules/*.ver and
rm -rf include/linux/modules/*.stamp  does the trick.
But its not a Red Hat thing, its a generic thing you'll hit with standard
kernels too
