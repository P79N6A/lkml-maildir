An updated version that at least describe how to build modules sanely
outside the kernel tree is queued for inclusion[1].

A totally revised makefiles.txt is queued for inclusion[1].

I have posted 2-3 version of a "separate src-tree" patch.
But due to the existence of such weird things as oprofile and xfs it did
not work in all cases. I symlinked all makefiles, but wanted to avoid
catching the rest of the directories.
I want my queued stuff applied before revisiting this though.
Main usage has been to build kernels based on different configurations,
not to mount src on a read-only media, that's sort of a side-effect.

make -C path/to/kernel/src SUBDIRS=$PWD modules
So simple when you know the trick. That what I have documented
in modules.txt.
[1] Most of what I have done has been submitted to lkml within the
past month. It can be found at 
http://linux-sam.bkbits.net
 in
the kbuild repository, where it is queued for inclusion.
