No, but I do know that my test case doesn't call fork(), so it's reproducible without 
involving COW.  Of course, I'm sure someone's going to tell me now that COW comes into 
effect even without fork().  If so, please explain.

The short answer: under "extreme" memory pressure, the data inside a page pinned by 
get_user_pages() is swapped out, moved, or deleted (I'm not sure which).  Some other data 
is placed into that physical location.
By extreme memory pressure, I mean having the process allocate and touch as much memory as 
possible.  Something like this:
num_bytes = get_amount_of_physical_ram();
char *p = malloc(num_bytes);
for (i=0; i<num_bytes; i+=PAGE_SIZE)
   p[i] = 0;
The above over-simplified code fails on earlier 2.6 kernels (or earlier versions of glibc 
that accompany most distros the use the earlier 2.6 kernels).  Either malloc() returns 
NULL, or the p[i]=0 part causes a segfault.  I haven't bothered to trace down why.  But 
when it does work, the page pinned by get_user_pages() changes.

My understanding is that mlock() could in theory allow the page to be moved, but that 
currently nothing in the kernel would actually move it.  However, that could change in the 
future to allow hot-swapping of RAM.

My driver needs to support all 2.4 and 2.6 kernel versions.  My makefile scans the kernel 
source tree with 'grep' to identify various characterists, and I use #ifdefs to 
conditionally compile code depending on what features are present in the kernel.  I can't 
use the kernel version number, because that's not reliable - distros will incorporate 
patches from future kernels without changing the version ID.
So I need to take into account distro vendors that use an earlier kernel, like 2.6.5, and 
back-port the patch from 2.6.7.  The distro vendor will keep the 2.6.5 version number, 
which is why I can't rely on it.
I need to know exactly what the fix is, so that when I scan mm/rmap.c, I know what to look 
for.  Currently, I look for this regex:
try_to_unmap_one.*vm_area_struct
which seems to work.  However, now I think it's just a coincidence.

Ugh, that means my regex is probably going to break.  Not only that, but I don't 
understand what you're saying either.  Trying to understand the VM is really hard.
I guess in this specific case, it doesn't really matter, because calling mlock() when I 
should be calling get_user_pages() is not a bad thing.
