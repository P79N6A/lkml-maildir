You're right. At fork(), the "job daemon", provided by ELSA, records
information about parent PID, child PID and also about the group of
processes they belong to. At exit(), accounting data are recorded by CSA
or BSD-like accounting.

You're right. One usage can be: apache, spamd and clamd can be put in a
job (a group of processes) by using the "job daemon" and automatically,
all children will belong to the same jobs respectively. So the gaol here
is really to perform per-group of processes accounting using ELSA and
CSA accounting data.
