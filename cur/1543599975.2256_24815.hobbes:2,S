Hello!
> 2.4.6 machine pushes lots of data on _first_ TCP connection after boot
Lots? I see only about 24K of data transmitted in both your samples.
Actually, the problem is more or less clear from your /proc/net/tcp.
You use some funny device or netfilter plugin, which leak memory.
You can look into 7th column of /proc/net/tcp to estimate amount of leaked
buffers. When it reaches ~15, connection stalls. Seems, it raises
monotonically, so that it looks like all the buffers leak.
What is output device?
