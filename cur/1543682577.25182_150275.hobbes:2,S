Hm, I tried 2.4.22-pre7 and it did not set disks to DMA mode, but it did set
the limit (max_kb_per_request). With the following modification, kernel
(2.4.22-pre7) initializes both disk to UDMA133, and as far as I can see, it
works ok.
In siimage.c there is a check for Maxtor disks - they are/should be set to
UDMA100.  Is this also necessary for Seagate SATA disks ?
