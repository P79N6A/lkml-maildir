My pet theory is that their main problem is that they didn't increase the socket
buffers (64K is simply not enough for 100Mbit/s full speed).
The other guess is that they are suffering a bit from the synchronous copy
(BPF does the copy asynchronously in the kernel while the system is waiting
for IO etc.). This could be fixed by a libpcap that uses a few worker threads
for packet recvmsg'ing.
Their main problem probably is that they think Linux is BSD, and it is not @)
