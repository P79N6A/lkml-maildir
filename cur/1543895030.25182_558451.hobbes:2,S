It may be the coolest, but there are others as well.  Btrfs looks good,
nilfs finally has a cleaner and may be worth a try, logfs will get
snapshots sooner or later.  Heck, even my crusty old cowlinks can be
viewed as snapshots.
If one has spare cycles to waste, working on one of those makes more
sense than implementing file versioning.
