I would very much like it if git used normal gzip files with a .gz
extension.  Doing it this way means that the compression methods can
be extended in the future.  I.e:
    ab/1234567890.gz	gzip compressed
    ab/1234567890.xd	xdelta compressed
I find the xdelta encoding very attractive since it can probably
reduce the size of the repository drastically.  A compression script
could for run nightly and xdelta compress everything that's older than
a few months (to figure out what files to create the delta from, just
look at the commit files and compare the parent tree to the current
tree).
Of course, this means that a dumb wget won't work all that well to
synchronize two trees, but it might be worthwile anyways.
