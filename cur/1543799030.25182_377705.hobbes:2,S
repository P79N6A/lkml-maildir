What exactly is ejecting flash media?
I have USB hard disks, USB Flash sticks, USB DVD-RAM, and an Ipod.  The only
one that even needs eject is the DVDRam.  IIRC, ALLOW_MEDIUM_MREMOVAL is for
CD-Rom (and possibly tape).  If the device is not in use, there's no reason
it cannot be unplugged then.  (Not in use as in not mounted, and noone's
accessing the raw device).
