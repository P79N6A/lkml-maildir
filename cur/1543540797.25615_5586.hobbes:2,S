Subject: [PATCH] tight spin loop in release()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

While debugging a problem on an SMP Alpha, I noticed that one process was
always in a tight loop in release(), waiting for its child to give up the
cpu.  This was the cause of a significant amount of cache line "ping-ponging"
between the CPUs.  It seems that the loop was rewritten between 2.2 and
2.4 whereas the 2.2 version would wait for the has_cpu flag to be cleared
outside of the lock.  This patch restores the loop to the 2.2 version to
avoid the problem described above.
Thanks,
Pat
