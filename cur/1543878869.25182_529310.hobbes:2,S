Subject: [PATCH 3/3] reparent kernel threads to swapper
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/10/239

A lot of kernel threads parented to /sbin/init slow down do_wait() when
a non-detached (user-space) process exits. Change reparent_kthread() to
use init_task as a parent. Since init_task can't go away, we don't need
to put the caller on init_task.children list.
NOTE: pstree doesn't show kernel threads with this patch.
