And that's the whole point.  In fact I hear exactly that problem from a
friend at SuSE who maintained an (inofficial?) dvb package.  He packaged
the kernel driver but of course it's not part of the official SuSE kernel
and even more so the kernel headers package that is created with the
kernel package but doesn't change during the lifetime of the glibc
package.  Now he's not allowed to just write into /usr/include/linux/
either because that directory is owned by the kernel headers package.
Please just get over it and put a copy of the headers into /usr/include/dvb,
this makes life easier for everyone.
