The problem you're describing is probably considered too hard to solve properly (bad answer,
but that is how it is currently) 
Yes there is. You can also force a normal (non preemptive) kernel into complete livelock by 
just giving it enough network traffic to do, so that it always works in the high priority 
network softirq or doing the same with some other interrupt. 
Just when this happens a lot of basic things will stop working (like page cleaning, IO 
flushing etc.), so your callbacks or module unloads not running are probably the least
of your worries.  
The same problem applies to a smaller scale to real time processes; kernel services 
normally do not run real-time, so they can be starved. 
Priority inversion is not handled in Linux kernel ATM BTW, there are already situations
where a realtime task can cause a deadlock with some lower priority system thread
(I believe there is at least one case of this known with realtime ntpd on 2.4)

Ugly. I guess one way to solve it would be to readd the 2.2 scheduler taskqueue,
and just queue a scheduler callback in this case.
