           Summary: ASUS driver ignores acpi_disabled and prints message
                    even if not used
    Kernel Version: 2.6.0-test4
            Status: NEW
          Severity: low
             Owner: len.brown@intel.com
         Submitter: andrew.grover@intel.com
So the way things are done in the kernel, it seems that you are only expected 
to print a line (or lines) in the dmesg when your device is actually found. 
This driver prints one always.
Also, it still tries to make ACPI calls even when acpi=off. It needs to learn 
about acpi_disabled.
