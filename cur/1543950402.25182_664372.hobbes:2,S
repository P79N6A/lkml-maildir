btw., the exact amount of available vmalloc space on 64-bit x86 is 32 TB 
(32768 GB), or 0x0000200000000000 hexa. (this is still only 0.0002% of 
the complete 64-bit address space [25% of the 128 TB 64-bit kernel 
address space] so we've got plenty of room)
but the first fundamental limit we'll hit on 64-bit is the 32-bit offset 
limit of binaries - this affects kernel modules, the kernel image, etc. 
We wont hit that anytime soon, but we'll eventually hit it. (user-space 
will be the first i guess)
