Hello all.
I am having issues with MTP driver under 2.6.8(rcx) on
Opteron.  Also under stock 2.6.7, however 2.6.7-bk20
appears to be the last to be functional.
The kernel boots but fails on the MPT (my main drive)
to pivot_root (perpetual "Reset").  Anyone have any
luck with this driver?
Thanks.
Phy
