Quoting Robbert Kouprie <robbert@radium.jvb.tudelft.nl> from ml.linux.kernel:
:BTW, did you get any explanation why this wasn't applied in -ac or main
:kernel?
None.
But I know that this patch is dirty because it attacks a hardware-dependent
layer from a rather generic one.  This may be why it's rejected.  And it
may also be completely APIC-BP6 specific.
I also know is that it works for me. ;-)
