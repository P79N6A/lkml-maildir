No, I don't think that's what Al is proposing.  The kernel-internal 
interfaces we've put in place to make Xen work could be reused to do 
some of the things you're talking about.  In particular, a kernel 
running under Xen has to be able to deal with non-contiguous physical 
pages, and reusing the same pagetable hooks would allow a kexeced kernel 
to run happily out of any random assortment of pages you manage to 
allocate for it.
