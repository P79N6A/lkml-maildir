So why don't we print the warning with 2.4 as well?
intrepid:~/CVS$ rpm -qi bdflush
Name        : bdflush    Relocations: (not relocateable)
Version     : 1.5        Vendor: Red Hat, Inc.
Release     : 21         Build Date: Sun Jun 23 16:19:27 2002
And it's run by /etc/inittab.
I don't know if returning -EINVAL (= removing the call completely in 2.5)
isn't better, though - does it have any compatibility implications?
