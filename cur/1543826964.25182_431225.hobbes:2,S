I'm not sure there's enough buy in to make this change yet ... our media
change handling is incredibly (and quite possibly far too) complex.
As documented in Documentation/cdrom/cdrom-standard.tex, the return
codes for media change are either 0 or 1.
Personally, I can't see a problem with overloading the true return to
have more information that the error codes provide, but before we do
this we need the buy in of the cdrom layer, since that's where this
handling came from, and we need to update the documents to reflect the
new behaviour ... someone also needs to consider what changes should be
made in the cdrom layer for this (and whether this is actually the
correct way to do this from the point of view of CDs).
