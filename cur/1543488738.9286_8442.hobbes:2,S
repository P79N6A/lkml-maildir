I'm using the framebuffer console with a vesa-2.0 compatible video card.
I've downloaded fbset-2.0(1998-10-28) but I can't change the mode timings
from the defaults in the vesa bios. I would like to do this because the
vesa bios defaults have really low refresh rates which are killing my
eyes (I'm using the XF86_FBDev as well).
Here's my /etc/fb.modes (set to use 800x600, 32bit, 72hz refresh):
# video mode for frame-buffer console
mode "800x600x16m"
        geometry        800     600     800     600     32
        timings         20000   44      64      27      45      120     6
endmode
this is what I try to do to change the mode:
$ fbset --verbose 800x600x16m
Linux Frame Buffer Device Configuration Version 2.0-pre (28/10/1998)
(C) Copyright 1995-1998 by Geert Uytterhoeven
Opening frame buffer device `/dev/fb0'
Reading mode database from file `/etc/fb.modes'
Using video mode `800x600x16m'
Setting video mode to `/dev/fb0'
However, I do not see anything changing. The refresh rate is as low as
ever. fbset without options gives the following:
$ fbset
mode "name"
    # D: 48.001 MHz, H: 46.876 kHz, V: 75.121 Hz
    geometry 800 600 800 600 32
    timings 20833 96 32 16 4 96 4
endmode
Actually it's not 75Hz refresh because my monitor does not support 46.7kHz
hsync, only 37.8 and 48.0, so i suspect it's running at 56Hz. even without
fluorescent lighting i can see the flicker.
Any ideas owuld be much appreciated.
