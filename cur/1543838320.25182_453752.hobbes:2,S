You mean the eHEA has its own concept of page size? Separate from the
page size used by the MMU?

Hmm, I'm not convinced. Having the struct doesn't really encapsulate
much, because most of the places where you use the h_galpa struct just
pull out the fw_handle anyway. So if you change the layout of the struct
you're going to have to change most of the code anyway. And in the
meantime it makes the code a lot less readable, most people understand
what "u64 addr" is about, whereas "struct h_galpa" is much less
meaningful. </2c>
