Were's the initrd going to get the firmware?  It's not in the freakin' tree
anymore.  If I have to go download a firmware image and stick it in an
initrd, why the hell wouldn't I just plug it directly into the kernel?
It's *my* kernel.

Oh for the love of God, will you people stop drooling over the fucking GPL?
It's *firmware*... it's just a bunch of bits.  It's *not* a program the
kernel executes.  It's just data. (__init_data to be exact.)

One man's bloat is another man's functionality.  Besides, it's got a hell of
a lot of company.  Ask yourself, will you miss 128_K_ in a machine with a
fiber channel card in it?  It "bloats" the kernel for people using that
hardware -- machines that don't need it can release it.

(If Sun would get off their ass(es) and support firewire, I'd stop using linux
 all together.  And before some smartass says they do, point to the ohci and
 sbp-2 drivers on the Solaris 8 Sparc CD.)
