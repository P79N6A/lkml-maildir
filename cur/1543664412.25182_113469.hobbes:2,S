The code has already gotten tentative approval from Linus.  And I suspect
the biggest reason it isn't in is that I have gotten distracted lately
and have not been asking for it to be included.
Being able to use this for processing panics is one of the side features
of kexec.  Admittedly one of the more useful ones, but definitely not a core
feature.
Given the encouragement I have received until I actually get negative
feedback from Linus I will continue to figure it has not made it into
the kernel because Linus has limited hours in the day, and an overflowing
inbox.
