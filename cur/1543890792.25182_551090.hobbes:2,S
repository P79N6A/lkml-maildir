I'd like that, if only because right now we have two separate paths that 
kind of do the same thing, and splice really is the only one that is 
generic.
I thought Jens even had some experimental patches for it. It might be 
worth to "just do it" - there's some internal overhead, but on the other 
hand, it's also likely the best way to make sure any issues get sorted 
out.
