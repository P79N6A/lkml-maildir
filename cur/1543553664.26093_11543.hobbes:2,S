It does matter. The sound driver needs to be able to _read_ the current 
levels. Almost all mixer programs will start by doing this, to set the 
slider to the correct place.

It does not know them. Correct. But with persistent module storage, it 
_could_ know them. It cannot know them the _first_ time the module is 
loaded after booting. That's fine. On subsequent loads, it can and 
should DTRT.
