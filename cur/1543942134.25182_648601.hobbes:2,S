With strong I meant Linux has much better algorithms to handle the standard
syn queue (syncookies was originally added when it had only dumb head drop) 
and there are minisocks which also require significantly less overhead
to manage than full sockets (less memory etc.) 
When I wrote syncookies originally that all was not true.

I have my doubts. It would be probably better to recheck everything
and then remove syncookies.
Also your sub PC class appliances rarely run LISTEN servers anyways
that are open to the world.
