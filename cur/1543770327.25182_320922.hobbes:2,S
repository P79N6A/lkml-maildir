It might be simpler to get things working with a basic implementation
first, (status quo), and then look into adding something like this. 
I don't see how this approach decreases the complexity of the task at
hand, especially not in regards to concurrency.

The dependency was STATED: "as a logical prerequisite...". 
The context was: "breaking the IRQ threads into a separate patch"
You misread it, and then commented on that.
