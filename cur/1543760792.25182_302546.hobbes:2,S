It is in a separate root filesystem, currently not used by anything on
the target.  It is likely to be in cache, but I can absolutely
guarantee it isn't open.  Hmm, server is x86_64 2.6.7, client is 2.6.10
MIPS.  I should upgrade them and see if that helps.
Unfortunately I haven't found any smaller testcases than installing an
entire root FS.
