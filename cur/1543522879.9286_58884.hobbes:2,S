It will damage performance. We want the hysteresis provided
by freepages.{min,low,high}...
Between .low and .high the one-second poll should do
the trick, making sure that all allocations are done
without delay.
Just around .low kswapd should be unconditionally
woken up.
Between .min and .low kswapd should be woken and
__GFP_WAIT allocations should wait.
Below .min only GFP_ATOMIC and PF_MEMALLOC allocations
should be allowed.
This is how the priorities have been intended
from the start on (except that we didn't have the
waiting part in the beginning, this needed fixing
later).
regards,
Rik
