Dinakar,
	can you try patch-2.6.15-rc7-rt3-rf1  on  
http://source.mvista.com/~dsingleton/
 and see if it works for your 
tests?
	This new patch creates a 'futex_deadlock' semaphore that we hang 
applications that
are deadlocking themselves.    This method will only hang the 
application, not the system,
as no other locks are held, like the mmap_sem,  just the futex_deadlock 
semaphore.
	NOTE: for pthread_mutexes  that are robust but NOT POSIX priority 
inheriting I return -EWOULDDEADLOCK,
since there is no POSIX specfication for robust pthread_mutexes yet.    
POSIX PI pthread_mutexes will hang
on the futex_deadlock semaphore.
	Let me know how it works.
David
