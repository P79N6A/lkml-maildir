This is only when the you reconstruct a disk that was once part of the 
RAID.  If you are adding a brand new disk, all stripes are dirty.
This happens in two scenarios: an unclean RAID shutdown, and when you 
have a remote mirror which can be disconnected by network problems.
If the RAID is integrated in the filesystem (or into an object storage 
system), you can handle the new disk case too.
