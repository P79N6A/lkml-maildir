And I live in Utah.  ;-) Seriously though, that schedule would
only be feasible given enough human resources -- and given either
source code or proper docs for their chipsets, which relies on
Nvidia playing nice and kindly choosing to share.
Relying on guesswork and/or reverse engineering without proper
vendor cooperation, which is exactly the case with the Utah GLX
driver, it'll take a much longer time and will likely not attract
the same amount of human resources as a result.
