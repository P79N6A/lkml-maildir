Ok I stand corrected, I had no idea there were machines that old where 
ACPI worked correctly in Linux.
Do you see the same kind of heat reduction in Linux as Win98?  What HZ 
value are you using, as the latency for entering C2 on your machine 
looks pretty substantial (Your C2 almost looks like a new machine's C3 
state, which is supposedly the first level where substantial power 
savings occur on a new machines).
