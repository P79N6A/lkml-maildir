Done, the patch can be accepted (I've not looked at the PCAP part). I've a 
note on the other fix there (the additional return).

Fine, agreed. For this, you can add my Acked-by. Probably at that time MAC 
randomization wasn't implemented.

This is due to patch:
"uml: drivers get release methods"
this could be useful to check whether other such changes are needed, by 
grepping for platform_device_unregister in exit paths, also for ubd driver.
That patch only fixed net_remove() and ubd_remove().
