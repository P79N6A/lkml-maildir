Only about 5% of the patches I submit (and about 50% of those that come back
with rejections) are non driver.

I did - for 2.3.18ac. On that basis I decided not to feed them to Linus
-yet-. There's a difference between Donalds big restructure being buggy
(which it is) and a dumb idea (which it most definitely is _NOT_)
So revision 2 might well be a lot cleaner and go in

ISDN is sorted, Ftape needs someone with the hardware willing to feed patches
to Linus (or me) for 2.3.x to bring it in line with the new code. I don't
have a flappy tape drive [I never want to see one again either to be
quite honest] so I can't do that myself.
I don't mind a single big floppy tape update going into 2.3.x to get us
back in sync. Since it was a genuine near rewrite its hard to avoid.
BTTV is tricky. The tree diverges three ways. I try and track the stable
parts of the other trees into the kernel.

People who want to receive bug reports and fix bugs. That isnt always the
author. In fact its often a good system for it not to be the author but
someone who is involved in documenting/supporting said project.
