If the patches are applied properly, and no rejects are noticed, then you
should be able to patch as much as you want, and it will be the same as af
downloading directly from kernel.org.
Now, if there was a previous kernel compile, and then several patches
applied, (say from 2.4.0 all the way up to 2.4.14...) then you'll probably
have to run "make mrproper" as mentioned by Keith...
