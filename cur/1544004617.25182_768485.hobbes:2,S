Since this is a regression, the best answer is usually the smallest 
possible patch. Which by all likelyhood would be the removal of 
CONFIG_TRACER_MAX_TRACE uses:
 ./kernel/trace/trace.c:#ifdef CONFIG_TRACER_MAX_TRACE
 ./trace.c:#ifdef CONFIG_TRACER_MAX_TRACE
 ./trace.c:#ifdef CONFIG_TRACER_MAX_TRACE
Note, please dont touch the Kconfig - that's just unnecessary churn 
that does nothing to resolve the regression. We'll have an unused 
symbol (and we'll fix it for real in the devel branches) but that's 
not an issue for .28.
Ok?
