If you think about it, you'll notice it's definitely not reasonable:
#include <linux/module.h> brings you a dependency on 5 config options.
#include <linux/pci.h> brings you a dependency on 6 config options.
By only including these two headers you are at 2048 combinations.
The number of valid configurations will be lower, but 500 test compiles 
sound realistically.
With have a dozen #include's you might need more than a million test 
compiles.
With a dozen #include's, you might need a trilion [1] test compiles.
Compile errors are quickly catched and don't cause any serious problem.
What bothers me more is that noone tested this patch against the kernel 
it was applied against.
The submitter didn't test it works (he didn't even test the compilation).
No user tested it.
Currently, -stable kernels get an 48 hours review on linux-kernel but 
zero testing.
How could this be improved?
Longer review/testing time?
Offer them as also one 2.6.17.7-rc1 patch?
