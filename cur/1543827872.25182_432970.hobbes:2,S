You are correct - and I will eventually apply your patch.  At the
moment, I'm throttling back on applying patches so that 2.6.17 can
finally appear (I don't want to be responsible for Linus saying
again "too many changes for -final, let's do another -rc".)

I don't know - that depends whether the throttle/unthrottle driver
methods are ever called from interrupt context or not.
What we could do is put a WARN_ON() or might_sleep() in there and
find out over time if they are called from non-process context.
