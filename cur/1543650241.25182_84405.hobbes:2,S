Hi folks!!!
   After several lonng days of syncing up my new console code I'm nearly
done. Unfortunely I have let the code code rot while it sat in Dave Jones
tree. So I have updates it but now it has several bugs. Tonight I'm going
to track them done but if people like to try this new code out and help me
track the new bugs I would be very happy. You can grab the latest code via
bitkeeper at
bk://linuxconsole.bkbits.net/stable.
I will make a diff in the next few hours. Thank you.
