yes, that's the case. I do believe we should go with Oleg's original 
patches.

yeah. Another problem was if we accidentally scheduled somewhere after 
the task was marked TASK_DEAD. (That used to be caught by another 
PF_DEAD check before the final schedule()).
all this stuff got changed as part of the PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY changes, and 
now we exit in a much more robust way.

no, it's not bogus. PF_DEAD is basically just a fancy, persistent flag 
for "mark the task state as EXIT_DEAD atomically before the final 
schedule". The TASK_DEAD flag is still necessary so that we dont stay on 
the runqueue. [we could use TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE - it should just not be 
TASK_RUNNING or TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE.]
in any case, i agree with Oleg's patches: with the current code it's 
unnecessary to signal towards schedule() to turn the PF_DEAD flag into 
EXIT_DEAD - we can do it right where we set PF_DEAD: immediately before 
calling the final schedule(). PF_DEAD is a relic from the days when the 
exit path was structured differently.
