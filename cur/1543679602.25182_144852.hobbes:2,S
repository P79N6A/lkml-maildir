Yes, that's true. When we did the performance tests we had in mind to
compare the worst case behaviour of nf-hipac and iptables.
Therefore we designed a ruleset which models the worst case for both
iptables and nf-hipac. Of course, the test environment could have been
tuned a lot more, e.g. udp instead of tcp, FORWARD chain instead of
INPUT, tuned network parameters, more interfaces etc.
Anyway, we prefer independent, more sophisticated performance tests.

Hm, but once the system starts to drop packets ip_packet_match and
ipt_do_table start to dominate the profile, don't they?
