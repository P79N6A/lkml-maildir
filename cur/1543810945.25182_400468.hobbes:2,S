That is a completely unreasonable position.  It is a requirement for those 
of us working on a variety of problems to be able to use new kernels on 
the "Enterprise" distributions in the market, as you have to be able to 
compare regressions and performance.  Swapping out all of userland just 
because hotplug can't get it's act together is *NOT* an option.
