Flash devices generally have wear-leveling, so I assume that they must
be doing some extensive sector remapping all the time.  I could be
wrong on that account, though.

Yeah, but if a device which is intellegent about bad-block remapping
actually runs out of spare sectors, that's a different failiure that
having a single defective sector.  In a server, it would definitely be
time to replace it.

OK.

Then why don't we invent a new filesystem, for known potentially
faulty media, which handles this case - why bloat all the existing
filesystems with code to handle it?  That idea isn't that far away
from the extra layer I suggested a few posts ago, and achieves the
same sort of thing.
