Hi Linus,
Maybe you can help me with a problem with the linux kernel (2.1.132).
In the file drivers/char/hfmodem/main.c line 698, the function
hfmodem_refclock_setscale is called. Both my "gcc" (2.7.2.3) and my "grep"
(GNU grep 2.1) are unable to find this function anywhere else in the
kernel source, not a prototype, not a declaration, nothing. GCC doesn't
like this when compiling, and I don't like this when fixing bugs.
Am I missing something trivial or is this function just FUD. In either
case, how should this problem be fixed? 
Greetings,
  Arjan van de Ven
