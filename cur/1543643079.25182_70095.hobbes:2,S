Or is there? :-)
Patrick, in drivers/base/core.c, there's this concept of platform_notify()
and platform_notify_remove().  Could I exploit this to get callbacks to the
EDD code to create a symlink at that point?  These aren't exported to
modules ATM, and I could see how multiple things may want to use this hook -
so instead, how about notifier lists (ala reboot notifiers) that the EDD
code could register with, instead of a single entry?  As a list, modules
could add/remove themselves easily.
Then, one more request - giving back the ability to make a symlink given the
device, not just a name.
Thanks,
Matt
