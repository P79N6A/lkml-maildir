Hi,
    I am using a Emulex's cLAN 1000 adapter in some machines. And with much
effort and help, I coud finally make the clan-2.0.x driver work under kernel
2.4.9 (and 2.4.10). However, I found if I turn "High Memory Support" off,
the kernel only report 896M through /proc/meminfo, but clan can work well.
On the other hand, if I turn "High Memory Support" to 4G or 64G, the kernel
can report the memory correctly, but clan gets "RX Async interrupt: vi 0,
error 010000" error (2.4.9) or clan gets "fatal (PCI?) error (status 2200)
result 0".
    I don't know if it's the problem of the kernel or the driver. And
without Highmem support, is that 128M memory really wasted? Or,  are they
just used by kernel and can't be used by user?
Sincerely
ZF
