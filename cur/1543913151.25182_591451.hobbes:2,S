The OpenBSD policy page doesn't agree with you:
"...That means that having granted a permission, the copyright holder 
can not retroactively say that an individual or class of individuals are 
no longer granted those permissions. Likewise should the copyright 
holder decide to "go commercial" he can not revoke permissions already 
granted for the use of the work as distributed, though he may impose 
more restrictive permissions in his future distributions of that work."
