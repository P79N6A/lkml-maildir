minutes after sending the report, i saw that 2.6.12-rc4-mm1 was out
already. compiled, booted, but today's shutdown produced the same error
:-(
just in case i was unclear: the shutdown completes, the oops shows "only"
up on the tty, no data corruption or the like so far.
are there any fancy debug flags i could set, to provide more information?
thank,
Christian.
