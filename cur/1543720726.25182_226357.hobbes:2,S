But your nack would almost certainly prevent a merge, pending resolution of
whatever the issues are.

External journals in ext3 aren't really supported - they just happen to
work as a plaything.  I haven't tested it in several years, but I believe
people do use it.
That being said, the bug you identify is an ext3 bug.  The easiest way for
me to fix it up within ext3 would be to issue some flush command to the
filesystem's disk, wait for that to complete, then write the buffer_ordered
commit block to the journal's disk.  That's blkdev_issue_flush(), yes?

I don't understand this one.
