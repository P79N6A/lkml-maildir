           Summary: Wacom driver isn't working
    Kernel Version: 2.5.66
            Status: NEW
          Severity: normal
             Owner: vojtech@suse.cz
         Submitter: simon@ulsnes.dk
Distribution: Gentoo 1.4r2 
Hardware Environment: AMD Athlon 650 MHz, VIA KT133 motherboard 
Software Environment: XFree 4.3.0, KDE 3.1.1 
Problem Description: The wacom driver simply doesn't work. Everything _looks_ ok, 
but the tablet (a USB Graphire2) doesn't respond. The driver is loaded OK and 
XFree reports that the tablet is found (on /dev/input/event1), so does the kernel 
when the driver is compiled in. 
On kernels 2.4.18 through 2.4.20, everything worked OK with similar kernel 
configurations. 
Please, I need my tablet! (and I need 2.5.x :) 
Steps to reproduce: 
1. Connect your Wacom Graphire2 tablet to your USB-port. (haven't tried the 
Intous series) 
2. Compile kernel 2.5.x with Wacom Tablet support either as a module or 
compiled-in. 
3. Modify /etc/X11/XF86Config to match your tablet. 
4. Realize that nothing works... :-(
