Hi folks,
I was asked this question today and could not come up
with an answer:
Does a SCSI host adapter itself get mapped to a
/dev/sgx device file? For example if you have an
adapter (ID=7)with one SCSI disk (ID=0), after a
SCSI bus scan do you get:
/dev/sga -> disk
/dev/sgb -> adapter ??
If not, how can you talk to an adapter driver if
there are no SCSI devices are attached to it?
All responses appreciated.
Cheers
