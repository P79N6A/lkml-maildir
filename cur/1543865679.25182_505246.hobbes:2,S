I'd much rather keep the current sleeping API in as much as is  
possible.  So, yeah, if we can get schedule() to notice and behave  
accordingly I'd prefer that.  In the current code it's keyed off  
finding a stack allocation hanging off of current->.  If the caller  
didn't care about guaranteeing non-blocking submission then we  
wouldn't need that.. we could use a thread_info flag bit, or  
something.  Avoiding that allocation in the cached case would be nice.

Yes, don't despair, I'm not co-routine ignorant.  In fact, I'm almost  
positive it was you who introduced them to me at some point in the  
previous millennium ;).
