Yep, I'd just noticed that one. The patch was actually put in by someone
to fix 2.0 compilation - and I noticed that it made the link order
problem go away for certain configs.

I'll try to find a clean way to make the MTD code work in all
configurations without having to do that. If it really comes to doing the
above, I'll probably just give up and let it stay 'broken' (IMO) along
with the rest of the kernel code which as you say already has link order
dependencies.
