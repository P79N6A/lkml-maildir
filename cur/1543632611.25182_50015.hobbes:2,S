Ah yes, the perennial "linux virus" scare -
the anti virus labs are hard at work trying
to drum up new business....
The thing with linux/unix "virii" is, they
are actually for the most part trojans -
they've been in labs for years, the problem
is that there is no suitable transport vector!
You'd have to dupe an unwitting superuser
(now there's a dangerous combination) into
running the "virus" by hand - sort of like
the "honor system" virus....
