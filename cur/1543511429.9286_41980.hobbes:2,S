I am not worried about the performance, just about the robustness. 
skb_queue_lock is really an internal lock to the skb module. That dev.c plays
with it is already not nice, but holding it for longer times while calling
other subsystems (kfree_skb -> skb->destruct etc.) is just nasty and violates
the abstraction barriers. And it is dangerous because it makes every skb_* 
list operation a death trap. 
Maybe the fix is simple, but the implications on the rest of the code are not :)

You never know, there are drivers doing clever things with it.
