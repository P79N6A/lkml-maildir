Hi,
pnp_register_driver could fail and return <0 result, in this case the 
driver shouldn't be pnp_unregister_driver.
But if you look in pnp_register_card_driver, the result isn't checked. 
And it is always pnp_unregister_driver in pnp_unregister_card_driver.
I know that pnp_register_card_driver shouldn't fail in normal condition, 
but who know...
