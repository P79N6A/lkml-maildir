Well, it seems to be a common problem to serial USB devices - if they
send data right after you close(), you oops... However, I'm no longer
looking into 2.4.x. 2.6.x works almost perfectly for me (I'll need to
work out some patches for better i386 support), but 2.6.x basically _is_
more painfree than 2.4.x ATM and IMHO. At least, for my configurations.
