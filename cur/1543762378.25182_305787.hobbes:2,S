Hi all!
Kernel 2.6.11.5 issue:
Passing .cpio.gz image with loadlin and initrd= kernel parameter. While
booting, the "checking if image is initramfs... it isn't (junk in
compressed archive)" message is shown.
To create the cpio.gz file I issued 
"find . | cpio -o -H newc | gzip -9 >../initram.gz".
What is going wrong while that procedure? I tried to find out what
exactly happens, found the method where it happens,... but can't track
it down to why it happens.
Is anyone out there knowing what that means? (I googled about that
issue, but can't find a solution also looked at Documentation/early-
userspace) Can someone please point me into the right direction?
best regards,
Bernhard Schauer
