actually, in the previous mail i've outlined a sensible way to help
safepoints in the kernel, for the case of the 1:1 model. I'd not call that
'not easily addressed' :-)
there's an even more advanced way to expose preempted user contexts in the
1:1 model: by putting most of the the register info (which is now dumped
into the kernel stack) into a page that is also mapped into user-space.
This too introduces (constant) syscall entry/exit overhead, but can be
done if justified.
