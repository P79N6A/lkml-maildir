got it !

TCP 0
I wasn't doing any particular test on n/w so it took me a while to figure 
out how I was triggering the WARNING. Apparently, this is happening when I 
run ketchup, but not always. This test machine is behind many firewall & 
routers so it might be a reason.
tcpdump gave me this output for a wget on kernel.org :
10:51:14.835981 IP r3-06.test.meiosys.com.40322 > pub2.kernel.org.http: S 737836267:737836267(0) win 5840 <mss 1460,sackOK,timestamp 1309245 0,nop,wscale 7>

10:51:14.975177 IP r3-06.test.meiosys.com.40321 > pub2.kernel.org.http: . ack 525 win 7504
I'm trying to get the WARNING and the tcpdump output for it but for the
moment, it seems it's beyond my reach :/
Hope it helps !
