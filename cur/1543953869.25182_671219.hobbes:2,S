Is it just me who feels this comment that says "in_atomic() is not a way
to tell if we are in atomic reliably and cannot be used for such and such"
very reader-unfriendly?  Ok, maybe the macro is not reliable and is not
meant to be used for the purpose its name seems to suggest (at least to a
non-kernel person).  An inevitable question is, then what is it good for?
What's the right situation to use this macro?
I guess an additional comment "even if this says no, you could still be in
atomic, but if this says yes, then you definitely are in atomic and cannot
sleep" may help unconfuse a clueless reader like myself.
