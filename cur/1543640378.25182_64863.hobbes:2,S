Look at 2.4.20-pre2-ac3 before you start doing that. A lot of cleanup
has been done, although there is plenty more left. A starter is to fix
the the ratemask/ratefilter stuff to not use silly while loops on the
aec/amd drivers if you are hacking on those, stick in the static
variables and document anything relevant looking.
Simple stuff first.
