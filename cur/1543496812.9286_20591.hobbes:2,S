I'm (gradually) setting up a web server (Apache 1.2.6-4) on a Linux box
(RH 5.1), and I've done the obvious things like rebuilding a minimised
kernel and shutting doen unwanted services in /etc/inetd.conf.  The
box will eventually sit outside my firewall (hopefully behind a router
that will 'protect' both firewall and web-server ...)
Are there any pointers to what else I should be doing to tighten up
security?  I've done a quick web search and there seems to be a lot
of leads to trawl through, so anything that gives me a direction in
which to jump would be apprecaited.
TIA
