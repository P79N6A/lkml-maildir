1) This isn't a kernel problem, this is an introductory C problem.
2) Even if it *were* a kernel problem, you'd have to show us at least
2-3 *complete* lines so we can figure out what the heck you're talking
about.  "When I use" doesn't tell us anything, "I get x = 10" can't happen
because you don't actually assign to x anyplace in that fragment, and so on.
3) Since you're working in userspace, printf() is your debugging friend,
and 'gdb' (and GUI's on top of it like 'ddd') are your other debugging friend.
