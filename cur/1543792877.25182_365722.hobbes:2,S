Since the exception stack size doesn't get set to other than 4k, this
isn't by itself wrong (the NLKD patch later conditionally sets this to
more than 4k). The problem, as said in the patch, is that pda.h cannot
include processor.h, and I see no solution for that (other than breaking
up processor.h).
