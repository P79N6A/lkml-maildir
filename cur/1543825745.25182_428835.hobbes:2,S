I suspect the real solution is to have a
disable_irq_handler(irq, handler) 
function which does 2 things
1) disable the irq at the hardware level
2) mark the handler as "don't call me"
it matches the semantics here; what these drivers want is 1) not get an
irq handler called and 2) not get an irq flood
