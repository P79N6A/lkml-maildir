Thanks, it was a great framework to work with.

Sorry, yes, that is where I tried to explain it.  I'll flush it out some
more.

Any kobject that is registered needs to have a name.  If someone tries
to call kobject_register() or kobject_add() without a name set they will
find out that it is not allowed :)
And yes, there are a few places in the kernel with kobjects that are
never registered.  I'm working on trying to get rid of them...

Heh, turns out that a lot of people sent me this privately :)

No, it's the ktype that does this, I'll go fix that up...

Ah, yes, now removed.
Thanks for the review, I really appreciate it.
