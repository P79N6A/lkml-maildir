Apologies, but this was a bug fix for a more serious issue.  The code
to report the directory entries by start time was fundamentally broken.
In particular the sequence:
opendir
readdir
readdir
readdir
....
closedir
can miss processes that exist for the entire duration of that
sequence.  Which is non-posix, non-intuitive, and has no reasonable
work around.
The sorting by pid happened as a side effect of finding a stable token
we can come back to so we can at least guarantee normal readdir
semantics.  That objects that exist for the entire readdir are
guaranteed to be displayed.  That objects that come into existence or
are deleted during the readdir may be missed.  That isn't perfect but
it is a useable semantic.
