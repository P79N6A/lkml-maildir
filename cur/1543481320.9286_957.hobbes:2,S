I don't want to start a flame war but I have to comment on this...
I've been the part of a couple of NGOS projects at a previous employer.  The
fact of the matter is that the OS guts don't matter to most folks except us
techno-geeks.  What folks want are applications that work and good hardware
support (ie device drivers).  I have seen superior OS designs (and
implementations) wither away and die because there was not a critical mass of
applications and device support.  Without *both* of those an OS is just an
interresting footnote.
The reason that Linux/Unix has been around for 25+ years IMHO is because it has
had a reasonably stable API set so a large body of applications could be
developed.  Given how long Unix has been around I don't expect Linux to
disappear in short order.
Also remember that Unix did not spring into being with its existing API set. 
Many APIs have been developed as lab prototypes that have stood the test of
time and become mainstream features that noone would consider not having.  Like
or not the Linux API set is evolving if for no other reason to support new
types of devices.  As new device paradigms become more standard we may see new
APIs to allow them to be better exploited.
