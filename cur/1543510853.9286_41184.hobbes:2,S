Parity and mirroring are nice, but they don't always save you. Our
machine room used to flood every now and then; it's hard to use parity 
bits to recover from that.
But yeah, Disk Is Cheap(tm). A bunch of extra disks and a tape drive
will run less than $136k, and I'll sleep a whole lot better at night.

Right; there's no off-site backup system quite like mirroring your
code to dozens of servers across the world and sending patches to a
mailing list with thousands of readers.
