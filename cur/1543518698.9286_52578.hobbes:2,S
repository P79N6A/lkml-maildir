Whatever happened to omirrd and the kernel support to match?
For those who have forgotten this was a daemon which you would run on two
computers and it would mirror high-level FS operations.  This is not like
RAID, NBD, drbd, or any of the other ways of mirroring raw devices.  This is
about mirroring operations such as file create/write/delete between file
systems on different machines.  In concept you could have two machines
sharing the same shared space running different file systems on different
sized partitions.
I currently have a need for this type of functionality for Maildir mirroring.
