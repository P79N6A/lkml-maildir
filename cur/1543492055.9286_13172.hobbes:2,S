We always, always use page-aligned lookups for the page cache.
(Actually there is one exception: certain obsolete a.out binaries, which
are demand paged with the pages beginning at offset 1K into the binary.
We don't support cache coherency for those and we don't support them at
all on filesystems with a >1k block size.  It doesn't impact on the hash
issue.)
