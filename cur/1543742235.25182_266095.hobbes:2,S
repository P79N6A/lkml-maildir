Subject: [PATCH 2.6.10-rc1] [m32r] Fix a typo of delay.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello,
This patch fixes a typo of arch/m32r/lib/delay.c.
It is required to fix a compile error for non-CONFIG_ISA_DUAL_ISSUE 
configuration.
Thanks.
NOTE:
  The m32r has a kind of ISA (instruction set architecture) 
  like a 2-way VLIW.  Originally the m32r has two types of 16-bit/32-bit
  instructions.  Only 16-bit instruction pair can be executed in parallel
  on a m32r chip with dual issuing support (e.g. M32700).
  According to the insturction dual issuing of the m32r, 
  a programmer/compiler can explicitly put two 16-bit instructions 
  into an instruction word, which are to be executed in parallel.
  ex. Assembly coding style of two 16-bit instruncions; insn A and B:
    1) insn A
       insn B              ; sequential execution (implicit)
    2) insn A -> insn B	   ; sequential execution (explicit)
    3) insn A || insn B	   ; parallel execution
