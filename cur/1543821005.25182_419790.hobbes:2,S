Subject: [BUG] 2.6.17-rc3 broke FP exceptions on x86

Running an FP exception using user-space application
(the runtime system for the Erlang programming language
in my case) on an Athlon64 with a 32-bit 2.6.17-rc3 kernel
quickly results in a complete system hang: mouse is dead,
keyboard is dead, the network doesn't reply to pings.
Had to reboot via the power switch to get the machine back.
This happended twice in a row. With 2.6.17-rc2 things
work fine like they always have before.
Just FYI. I'll try to debug this this weekend if noone
beats me to it.
