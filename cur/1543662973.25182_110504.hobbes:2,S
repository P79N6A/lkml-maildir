The cache probing worked in 2.5.58. Nothing with usb-storage worked in 2.5.59
in 2.5.60 & 61 cache probing fails for me, but I can still read. Writing causes
a BUG() in usb-storage due to not being able to recover from some other error
(don't know what the error is though - the stack trace only shows scsi_eh)
although the data does get written
