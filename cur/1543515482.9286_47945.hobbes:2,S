	Hmm, I have not rechecked this in 2.2.x, however with <= 2.0.x
this was not so.
	When an interface in promisc mode received a packet destined
for another mac, but to an IP the local host owns it would, as you
said, not arp.  It *would* respond to the packets though.
	To restate, it was assumed that anything with a locally owned
IP that made it to the IP layer was ours.  Should one have an
interface in promisc, where we receive a packet with an IP we have but
destined to another MAC addr it would get passed to the IP layer, and
dealt with exactly as if it was sent to our MAC addr.
