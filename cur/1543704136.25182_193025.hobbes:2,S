How would you propose handling what's done in ppc_kgdb_init ?  I could
make it a __setup, ala how kgdb_8250.c works, but that too won't allow
for 'first line of C'.  OTOH,  if breakpoint did:
if (!kgdb_initalized) {
   ... work of kgdb_entry() ...
}
... normal breakpoint() code ...
PPC would be fine, as would other arches which need to do some setup.
