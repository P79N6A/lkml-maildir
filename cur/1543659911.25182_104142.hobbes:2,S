Interesting if they are, but probably too late to determine. In any case
you *might* be able to clean it up with the extended menu geometry stuff
in fdisk. You might be able to go into the BIOS and tell it to use LBA,
although you might also lose what's on the drive that way.

I suspect that this will not go back in the mainline kernel, although the
"best done in user space" comment made by someone is a bit of a challenge
when you need it in place to get the system booted... Best avoid needing
it if you can.
I saved the patch, some of the local users might have ned of it.
