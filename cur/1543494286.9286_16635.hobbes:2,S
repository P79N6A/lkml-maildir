Hello,
what I can't understand: why do we need all these additional patches to
get the kernel sources NFS able? I mean, if the patches are necessary, why
do we have to carry them from version to version, wouldn't it be better to
have them in the official sources ASAP? If we don't need them, why at all?
For someone who is not involved in development at all, it's rather fussy
to get knfsd running.
just thinking about it... ;-)
 cu, Steffen
