The virtual pid is different depending on who is asking.  So simply
storing current->realpid and current->pid isn't helpful, as we would
still need to call a function when a pid crosses user->kernel boundary.
However we could make the patch far less invasive by skipping the
task_pid() macro altogether.  Switching current->pid to current->__pid
was to make sure we catch any ->pid accesses which we may have missed,
during compilation.
Is that approach (keeping task->pid as the real pid and dropping the
task_pid() macro) preferred by all?
