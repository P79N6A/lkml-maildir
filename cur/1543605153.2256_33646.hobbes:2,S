Understood.
I'd just like to reiterate that my patch isn't the cause
of your problem.  It's just that my patch doesn't address
your problem.  IIUC.
I provided a "workaround patch" before.  Can you continue
to use that for the time being?
I'd like to make a promise that I'll submit a new patch
soon that will address your problem; however I don't yet know
exactly how to go about addressing it.
