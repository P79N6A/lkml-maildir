The problem is that if this doesn't work, there are some serious
questions about the correctness of the Lucent Microelectronic Venus
modem.  I've forwarded this to someone in the Lucent Modem group, who
can hopefully look at this (and maybe can ship me a sample hardware so
I can play with it, although I'd much rather that he tell me how to
work around the hardware bug, or tell me that all you need is a
firmware upgrade to fix the bug in the modem).....
