It's updated AFTER we drop the page lock. It's not enough to do it 
page-per-page, you have to do it protected by the only thing that 
block_write_full_page() sees, namely the page lock.
So what can happen is
	copy data from user space to page
	commit_write()
	unlock_page()
	**preemption happens**
			fsync
			block_write_full_page()
			doen't see the new i_size, clears the data
	**preempt back**
	update i_size.
end result: zeroes where the process wrote stuff.

That just hides the race.

Absolutely. I think the bug happens for the regular case, simply because 
nobody is even _using_ direct-IO. But in direct-IO, the race is about a 
million times bigger, because we won't actually update i_size until much 
much later.
