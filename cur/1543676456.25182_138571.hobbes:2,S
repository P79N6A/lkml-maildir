   Yes, but the comment certainly is confusing.  How about something like
   this:
No arguments.

     David> what physically contiguous addresses mean about how they'll
     David> be contiguous in the bus addresses the device will actually

   This sounds all very dramatic, but try as I might, all I find is three
   places where PCI_DMA_BUS_IS_PHYS is used:
   	- ide-lib.c: used to disable bounce buffering
   	- scsi_lib.c: used to disable bounce buffering
Fix your grep, 
   	- tg3.c: what the heck??
In order to workaround a "just below 4GB dma address" bug in the
chip, we have to have a reliable way to "remap" the given networking
buffer to some other DMA address that does not meet the hw bug case.
If we don't have an IOMMU, we have to change the buffer itself and
we accomplish this with SKB copy.
But on an IOMMU system, we could end up mapping to the same bogus
DMA address.  So we have to solve this problem by keeping the
existng bad mapping, doing a new DMA mapping, then trowing away
the old one.
   Did I get this right (or at least close enough)?
Precisely.
   Otherwise, you could just always use the copy-the-entire-buffer
   workaround.
The new PCI dma mapping I make could map to the SAME bad DMA
address, that's the problem.  I could loop forever making new
DMA mappings on an IOMMU system, each and every one falls into
the hw bug case.
   I really dislike PCI_DMA_BUS_IS_PHYS, because it introduces a
   discontinuity.  I don't think it should be necessary.
I totally disagree.

   Yes.  Would you mind fixing that?
Sure, no problem.
