Err.. perhaps not everyone, Alan.
Since adopting 2.2.2, I've had:
 -- a couple of mysterious "kill X and drop back to command line" events
 -- some unexplained Ooops in find_buffer
 -- userland NFS is just plain broken (locks up most of the time)
     with both 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 (but knfs seems to be working so far).
 -- most unusual swapping behaviour on one occasion -- ran out of swap
     doing basically nothing unusual.
I've done all the Right Things and have all the Right Stuff in this box.
Still feels like a development kernel here,
ever since the MM code got re-designed just before "release".
Cheers
