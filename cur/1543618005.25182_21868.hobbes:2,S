Problem with sys_readahead is that it doesn't work for big IO sizes. 
e.g. you read in big blocks. You have to do readahead(next block); 
read(directfd, ..., big-block); 
The readahead comes to early in this case; it would be better if it is
done in the middle of read of big-block based on the request size.
Otherwise you risk additional seeks when you overflow the 'read window',
which is all to easy this way.
