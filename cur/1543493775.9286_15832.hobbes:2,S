I am running kernel version 2.2.6 or at least I should be ..... I compiled
etc. on SuSE Linux 6.0 which is suposed to be 2.2 ready.  The kernel
installed in /vmlinuz as usual, but when I reboot the intro still says I am
running 2.0.36 and so does /proc/version and uname -r ..... I wouldn't care
except now I can't load modules because the setting for the modules
directory is /usr/modules/uname -r .... which is returning 2.0.36 instead of
2.2.6 .... this is preventing me from using PPP in linux..... please help.
