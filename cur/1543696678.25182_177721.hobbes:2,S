If poll is not scalable, which method should I use when writing 
multithreaded socket server?
What is the most efficient model to use?
Is there a "standard" model to use when writing a scalable multithreaded 
socket serve such as "io completion ports" on windows?
From the "Microbenchmark comparing poll, kqueue, and /dev/poll", kqueue is 
the way to go. Am I correct?
What is the best solution to use on Linux?
Also, why is it that poll doesn not return with "close signal" when a 
thread-1 calls poll and thread-2 calls close on a sockfd1? It seems that 
poll only handles close signal when a client disconnects from the server. 
I've seen this mentioned here before, has it been fixed?
Thank you~~~
