I'm not sure anybody would really be unhappy with pptr pointing to some 
magic and special task that has pid 0 (which makes it clear to everybody 
that the parent is something special), and that has SIGCHLD set to SIG_IGN 
(which should make the exit case not even go through the zombie phase).
I can't even imagine *how* you'd make a tool unhappy with that, since even 
tools like "ps" (and even more "pstree" won't read all the process states 
atomically, so they invariably will see parent pointers that don't even 
exist any more, because by the time they get to the parent, it has exited 
already.

A number are already there, of course, since they use the kthread 
infrastructure to get there.
