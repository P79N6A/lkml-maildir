It is, but I can also see UML stealing the SEGV from the child.  The
UML skas does this - a ptrace extension, PTRACE_FAULTINFO, is used to
extract page fault information from the child, and other pieces of the
patch are used to fix the fault without the child continuing until
it's fixed.  So, in this case, the child never sees the SEGV.
