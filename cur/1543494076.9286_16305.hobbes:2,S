Why do people spend so much time making assumptions?
Some web servers run CGI scripts. If you aren't using an "in-server"
implementation of CGI, you might have substantial cpu time being
consumed by non-server processes. Even if you are using an in-server
CGI, that means some threads/processes are going to be using a lot
more CPU time than the ones serving out static pages. Thus, you
still get to worry about affinity.
