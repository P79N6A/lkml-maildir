Ok, too strange for words.
I'm inclined to make things more explicit, and make
sis_get_driver look like this..
static void __devinit sis_get_driver(struct agp_bridge_data *bridge)
{
    if (bridge->dev->device == PCI_DEVICE_ID_SI_648) {
        sis_driver.agp_enable=sis_648_enable;
        if (agp_bridge->major_version == 3) {
            sis_driver.aperture_sizes       = agp3_generic_sizes;
            sis_driver.size_type            = U16_APER_SIZE;
            sis_driver.num_aperture_sizes   = AGP_GENERIC_SIZES_ENTRIES;
            sis_driver.configure            = agp3_generic_configure;
            sis_driver.fetch_size           = agp3_generic_fetch_size;
            sis_driver.cleanup              = agp3_generic_cleanup;
            sis_driver.tlb_flush            = agp3_generic_tlbflush;
        }
    }
                                                                                                                            
    if (bridge->dev->device == PCI_DEVICE_ID_SI_746) {
        /*
         * We don't know enough about the 746 to enable it properly.
         * Though we do know that it needs the 'delay' hack to settle
         * after changing modes.
         */
        sis_driver.agp_enable=sis_648_enable;
    }
}

It's pretty convinced it's in AGPv3 mode too.
Oh well. 8-)
