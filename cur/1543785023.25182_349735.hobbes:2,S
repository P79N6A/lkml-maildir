I know I am going to regret getting pulled into this ;-(.
This effort started on April.  Eric Moore, Mike Miller and I started
work on a SAS transport class and then later pulled Luben it at the
suggestion of Douglas Gilbert (if I remember correctly).  We later
mutually agreed that Luben would take over the transport class work as
he seemed to have much more experience with this sort of thing.  The
original idea was to implement a SAS transport class that would allow
the LSI and Adaptec driver to get into kernel.org (or others at the
time) and to find a way to get SDI/CSMI API's into the kernel without
the use of IOCTL's.  Luben then went off on his own and came up with his
effectively Adaptec only solution.

HP never suggested that Christoph do a SAS transport layer. We were
happy to provide some equipment when we found out that he was working on
it.  Please don't speak for HP. I am sure that LSI would prefer you
don't speak for them either.

If my memory serves correctly, there were 10-12 people at that BOF,
representing the SCSI kernel maintainers and all of the vendors
currently providing SAS hardware.  Virtually everyone disagreed with
your implementation (which you indeed emailed shortly before the
conference) that would only work with one vendor's card. The suggestion
was made that you convert your code to various library layers so that it
would work with all vendors.  A suggestion which it seems that you
continue to reject.

From HP's point of view (or mine at least).  We would prefer something
that works with every vendors card.  Not Adaptec's (or is it Luben's)
vision of the perfect card.
