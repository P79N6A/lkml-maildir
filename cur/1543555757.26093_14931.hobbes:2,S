However , this won't change boot sequence at that is store in the
CMOS on your RTC chip... if you really wanted though; you could mess
with that via /dev/nvram or whatever it's called.
Not that I suggest this is a good idea, most likely you will corrupt
it and the BIOS will get a checksum error and reinitialize the nvram
to defaults.

    Yes.  All the BIOS does is configure your hardware.  Get docs on
    your hardware, and you can do anything that BIOS does.  For
    example, if your parallel port is disabled in BIOS, and you have
    the datasheet for your southbridge, then you can "manually"
    enable the parallel port by writing certain values to certain PCI
    config registers.
