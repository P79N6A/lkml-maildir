   Are you saying that the original bug report may not actually be a
   problem?  Is ms->rss actually protected in _all_ of the right
   places, but people got confused because of the syntactic sugar?
I don't know if all of them are ok, most are.
Someone would need to do the analysis.  David's patch could be used as
a good starting point.  A quick glance at mm/memory.c shows these
spots need to be fixed:
1) End of zap_page_range()
2) Middle of do_swap_page
3) do_anonymous_page
4) do_no_page
Later,
