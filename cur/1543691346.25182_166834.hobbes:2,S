It was discussed on other occasions, and it "was decided"
(sprinkled with holy penguin pee) that such things go into
drivers/, e.g. drivers/serial/sunsu.c is Sun-specific,
but it helps to keep it near drivers/serial/8250.c, for
diffing. If an additional API is involved, e.g.
sbus_alloc_consistent, drivers get a subdir like
drivers/sbus or drivers/s390. Also, you never know
when sharing hits you across the head, e.g. sparc, sparc64,
and m68k (for sun3) share some drivers.
