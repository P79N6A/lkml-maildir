I had issues with that patch as well, except that rather than a hang, I'd
get 'Uncompressing kernel...' and then the screen would clear and instead
of a penguin logo and boot messages, there'd be a second or so of silence
and then the dread 'ka-chunk' of the machine resetting for a reboot,
and then I'd be looking at the BIOS screen again.
Reverting that patch fixed it for me as well.
I'm running on a Dell Latitude C840, /proc/cpuinfo says:

As usual, I'm willing to test additional/revised patches if needed...
