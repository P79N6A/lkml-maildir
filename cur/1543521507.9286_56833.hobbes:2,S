Subject: group orphaned checking using p_pptr or p_opptr?

Hi all,
    I am running Linux 2.2.9 kernel.
When a process exits, the function exit_notify, in kernel/exit.c, checks 
if its group will become orphaned as a result of its exit. 
It first checks if its parent is in a different group using the 
p_pptr->pgrp field. Instead of p_pptr, shouldn't it check the original
parent's group, i.e p_opptr->pgrp ? 
Because if the process is being debugged, the p_pptr will be the debugger
but we are interested in the original parent.
For example, in the following cases, the original parent
is considered rather than the current parent.
- In handling the getppid system call, the *original parent* 
process id is returned.
- In handling the setpgid system call, it is checked whether the caller is
the *original parent* of the process whose group is being changed.
Can somebody tell me why the present parent, and not the original parent,
is considered during the orphaned group checking ?
Thanks,
Sushil.
