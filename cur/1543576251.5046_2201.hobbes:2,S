   Well I just use free(), nothing more, nothing special, just like a
   typical data-base program.  Free should just set a new break
   address after the reclaimed data falls below some watermarks it has
   established. Both malloc() and free(), use already allocated
   data-space for their work-space (last time I looked at library
   code).
malloc and free maintain their free buffers pools using linked lists,
thus a free() does two stores to the (2 * sizeof(void *)) bytes before
or after that buffer.  Thus the swapping.
Use mmap()/munmap() directly and manage things totally yourself to get
rid of this.
