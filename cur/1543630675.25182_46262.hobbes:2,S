The system can avoid this by
 a) not flushing sync  (i.e. giving up on pages that won't flush immediately)
 b) being nondeterministic about it .. not always retrying the same
    thing again and again.
Can one achieve those characteristics? I suspect setting the vm
sync boundary to 100% should arrange for (a)?
