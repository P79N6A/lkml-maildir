See the documentation under the kernel source tree. The code is
already there. You need only to select by passing correct kernel
parameters.
elevator=       [IOSCHED]
                        Format: {"as" | "cfq" | "deadline" | "noop"}
                        See Documentation/block/as-iosched.txt and
                        Documentation/block/deadline-iosched.txt for details.
