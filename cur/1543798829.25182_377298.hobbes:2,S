It's actually worse because if they have a 32bit compat issue
then ioctl can be fixed up, but read/write can't. 
I wish the people arguing against ioctl all the time would
just stop that because the alternatives are usually worse.

Exactly - and driver writers usually don't get that right so we
need to have a tool to fix it up in the end. And with ioctl
that's easiest.
