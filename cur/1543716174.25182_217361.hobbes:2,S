'ptr' _is_ a char pointer, and the code (visible in the part of
the patch you didn't include) already performed pointer arithmetic
on it relying on it being a char pointer. The old code had no
sane reason at all for updating 'ptr' via a cast-as-lvalue.
cast-as-lvalue is not proper C, has dodgey semantics, and can
always be replaced by proper C.
