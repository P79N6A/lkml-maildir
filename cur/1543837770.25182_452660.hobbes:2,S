Your trying to squeeze blood from a turnip (not tulip) by trying
to run 8 interfaces at once on that system.

The kernel should survive short term memory pressure (it will get noisy), 
but you can't survive that way forever. Unless memory is free soon,
it will deadlock itself because some critical operation can't get
memory.
You could try reducing the size of the transmit queues, and receive
rings, either with scripts or by modifying the drivers.
