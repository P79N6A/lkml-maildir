you could try x86.git and enable CONFIG_KMEMCHECK, which catches all 
sorts of memory corruption bugs at its root:
  
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/x86.git/README
it's for 32-bit currently, and depends on the following CONFIG details 
in your .config:
        depends on X86_32
        depends on !X86_USE_3DNOW
        depends on !CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE
        depends on !DEBUG_PAGEALLOC && SLUB
note that CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC=y will catch a few types of corruption 
too. Note that KMEMCHECK and DEBUG_PAGEALLOC are exclusive.
