What about a board that fits in a 5 1/4" bay, leaving room for a 3.5"
drive below it, and has ARM, VLSI IDE controller, ethernet, ...
In a standard low-cost box designed for a single 5 1/4" device like
CD-ROM or tape drive, this becomes a standalone network server. If you
need a bunch, put them in a big case designed for a PC server or a
RAID array.
The 5 1/4" form factor gives you enough room to have connectors for
two IDE controllers, so you can use standard motherboard chips for the
IDE and run two drives fast or four much less so. It also allows you
to support fairly large memory for some applications.
This doesn't take a drive manufacturer. Anyone building PC motherboards
or embedded systems could take a crack at it.
