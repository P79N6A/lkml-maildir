Thanks for the reply, Andrea,
Does your system still fail running the latest ACPI release patch?
You can get it here:
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/lenb/linux-acpi-2.6.git release
or check out Linus' top of tree and apply the plain patch:
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/lenb/acpi/patches/release/2.6.25/acpi-release-20070126-2.6.25-rc5.diff.gz
If no, does applying
http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/mmotm/broken-out/revert-acpi-thermal-fixup.patch
still fix the issue?
thanks,
-Len
