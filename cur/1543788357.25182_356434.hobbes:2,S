If you're thinking about 32-bit compatibility mode apps, this patch doesn't 
affect them at all, because signal handling for 32-bit apps is already 
handled by completely separate code paths (in arch/x86_64/ia32/ia32_signal.c 
instead of arch/x86_64/kernel/signal.c).  And note that the 32-bit ABI's 
signal handling code path already saves the CS and SS properly, in exactly 
the same way as my proposed patch does for the 64-bit ABI; my patch 
effectively just brings the two in line with each other.
There is already no way for a 64-bit app to register and use a 
compatibility-mode signal handler: the kernel's signal handling code path for 
the 64-bit ABI always sets up a signal handling frame assuming that the 
signal handler will be 64-bit, and I see no reason this should be changed.  I 
would merely like it to be possible for a 64-bit app to run snippets of 
32-bit code when it needs to, and be able to catch signals that may occur 
while running that 32-bit code, without immediately dying a horrible flaming 
death as it does now because of the kernel trying to run a 64-bit signal 
handler with a 32-bit code segment still loaded.
Cheers,
Bryan
