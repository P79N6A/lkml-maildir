Tricky.
It's wrong of the Red Hat package to misidentify itself in this manner.
It would sort-of make sense for `depmod -V' to autodetect the kernel
version and print either "modutils" or "module-init-utils".  But that's not
accurate either: a `make modules_install' would fail when performed under a
2.4 kernel.
So yes, I think that your patch to RH modutils+module-init-tools is the best
approach: after all, it tells the truth.
Meanwhile, I'll alter Valdis's patch so that it warns, but does not fail
the make.
