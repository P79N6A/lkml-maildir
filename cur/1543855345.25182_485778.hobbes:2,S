Well, since "mask" is now made to be of the same type as "x", every 
sub-expression actually has the same type, modulo the normal C behaviour 
of "expand to at least "int".
So arguably, the result is _more_ like a normal C operation this way. 
Type-wise, the "ALIGN()" macro acts like any other C operation (ie if you 
feed it an "unsigned char", the end result is an "int" due to the normal C 
type widening that happens for all C operations).
But I don't care horribly much. Al may have some other reasons to _not_ 
want the normal C type expansion to happen (ie maybe he does something 
unnatural with sparse ;)
