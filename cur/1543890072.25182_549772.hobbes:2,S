Just why did no one get a kernel oops? After all, the code tried to
write to constant memory.
This is the first patch of two. There is yet another section of Linux 
code that runs in 9600-only, and I need to figure out which.

The Linux kernel ignored the PROM's serial settings (115200,n,8,1 in
my case). This was because mode_prop remained "ttyX-mode" (expected:
"ttya-mode") due to the constness of string literals when used with 
"char *". Since there is no "ttyX-mode" property in the PROM, Linux
always used the default 9600.
