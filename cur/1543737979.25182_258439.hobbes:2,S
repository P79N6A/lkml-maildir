I agree entirely.  Before when I was being a penny pincher about
how much went in the kernel, it might have made sense to have
the mems_exclusive and cpus_exclusive precursor flags.
But now that we have demonstrated a bone fide need for a really
really exclusive cpuset, it was silly of me to consider offering:

These multiple flavors just confuse and annoy.
You're right.  Just one flag option, for the really exclusive cpuset,
is required here.
A different scheduler domain (whether same scheduler with awareness of
the boundaries, or something more substantially distinct) may only be
attached to a cpuset if it is exclusive.
