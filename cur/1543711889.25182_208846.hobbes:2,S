This patch propagates the PT_GNU_STACK setting into the vma flags, allowing
the architecture to set the stack permissions non-executable if the
architecture chooses to do that, yes?
Which architectures are currently making their pre-page execute permissions
depend upon VM_EXEC?  Would additional arch patches be needed for this?
This may not get past Linus of course.  It doesn't even get past me with
that magical undocumented -1/0/+1 value of the executable_stack argument. 
Please replace that with a proper, commented, #defined-or-enumerated value,
thanks.
