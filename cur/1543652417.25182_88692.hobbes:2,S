This raises a good point - I guess we should be doing something like
checking user limits (against locked memory, 'ulimit -l'). Something along
the lines of this [warning, dirty-fastly-scratched-draft, untested]:

However, we could break the semantics of other programs that expect that the
amount of memory they lock is the only one that is used in the rlimit ... 
What else could be done?
