In the SyncLink drivers I've always passed a devname
that is unique to each device instance, using the
form printf(devname, "%s%d", basename, instance_num).
Ethernet device instances also seem to do this.
I see that the generic serial 8250 driver uses
a constant name, as does aic7xxx.
Unique device names are useful for identifying
which device instance is on a particular interrupt
(/proc/interrupts), but other drivers beside uhci_hcd
use a constant name so I guess that is legal :-)
Either way, the generic IRQ code should deal with
duplicates without generating an oops.
