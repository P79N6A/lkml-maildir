This is true. These platforms do not (and afaik will not) have an
IOMMU and thus its impossible to implement a secure userspace driver
interface that supports DMA. In general, IOMMUs are only expected on
platforms which implement virtualization, have a processor address space
larger than the io address space or both.

This is also true. But looking at the current development of
virtualization in hardware on the PC market (and also the increasing
amount of main memory) makes me sure that in a few years every new sold
_PC_ will haven an IOMMU inside. But the problems with the other
platforms or older hardware will certainly remain.
