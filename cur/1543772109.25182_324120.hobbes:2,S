btw since the last discussion was about not changing the existing
interface and thus exposing security flaws, what about introducing
another prctrl that says maybe PRCTRL_ACROSS_EXECVE?
Any new user-space applications must understand the implications of
using it so it's safe in that aspect. Yes?
(yeah it's rather silly since there already is an unused
keep_capabilities flag but that would change old interfaces so ok)
