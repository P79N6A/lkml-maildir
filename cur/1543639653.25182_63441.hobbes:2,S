yes - the 0x40 segment can be saved & restored safely. We have per-CPU
GDTs so nobody can modify them while the APM BIOS is executing. (assuming

another thing: do we want this with descriptor priviledge level 3? Because
the APM 0x40 GDT entry was a ring 0 descriptor, but that would not be
accessible to Wine or DOSEMU.
