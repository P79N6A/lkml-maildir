I'm confused.  Last time I looked at the code that was
exactly what the semantics were?

This is a pretty good assumption for v3.

Bruce and I briefly discussed this when I dropped into CITI the other
week.  The conclusion was that this is a non-issue in the short term
because all the clients do a single READ or WRITE per call.  In the
long term I hope to rewrite some parts of that code to do away with
one of the memcpy()s in the WRITE path, and handling multiple WRITEs
for v4 would be a natural extension of that.
