there were two bugs in B6, the stack frame got shifted which resulted in
corrupted registers, plus 'cld' has to be done after saving user-space
flags. (tested patch against 2.3.32-pre2 attached) With these fixed it
works just fine with Artur's LD_PRELOAD library:
    int $80:
	moon:~/ldp> ./lat_syscall null
	Simple syscall: 0.2817 microseconds
    fastcall:
	moon:~/ldp> ./lat_syscall null
	Simple syscall: 0.5450 microseconds
