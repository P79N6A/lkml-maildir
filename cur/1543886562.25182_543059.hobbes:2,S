It doesn't probe the hardware in dangerous ways. (Search for mode_scan
in video.S) It works by trying to set a mode via the normal
AH=0/AL=mode/int 0x10 method for all possible values of mode. It then
checks if the bios reports the new mode as being set and reads a few
standard vga registers to determine if it is a text mode. It's
completely independent of the CONFIG_VIDEO_SVGA stuff.

Yeah, Voyager and Elan should be detected at runtime in that case. But
if one ever wants to do that, this would be a good time... This rewrite
needs thorough testing anyhow. ;)

Heh. I don't know about desirable, but it is not really impractical. The
Relocatable patches already introduced a small bit of 32-bit code in
setup (git-show 968de4f0 arch/i386/boot/setup.S). This has disappeared
in your rewrite, however.
That makes me wonder: (from arch/i386/boot/pmjump.S)
37         movw    $__BOOT_DS, %cx
38 
39         movl    %cr0, %edx
40         orb     $1, %dl                 # Protected mode (PE) bit
41         movl    %edx, %cr0
42
43         movw    %cx, %ds
44         movw    %cx, %es
45         movw    %cx, %fs
46         movw    %cx, %gs
47         movw    %cx, %ss
48
49         # Jump to the 32-bit entrypoint
50         .byte   0x66, 0xea              # ljmpl opcode
51 2:      .long   0                       # offset
52         .word   __BOOT_CS               # segment
I thought the 32-bit jump was required to come before the segment loads.
Does this code load values from the gdt, or are they just loaded as real
mode segments? As long as it does not crash it does not matter, because
head.S reloads them again.
Thanks,
