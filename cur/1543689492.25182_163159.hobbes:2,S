The best solution will be to unify calibrate_tsc and calibrate_tsc_hpet.
Only issue is, we need to switch between pit based mach_count* routines
and HPET based ones at runtime. As we want to use pit, even when HPET is
configured in and is not available in the hardware. So, "mach_timer.h" 
mechanism may not work as is.

Yes. This seems to be mm4 only issue, coming from 4G-4G 
patch and cyclone-fixmap-fix.patch
