Instead of the lame claims on how ugly it is to do hardware mixing in
kernel space the ALSA fans should ask them self the following questions:
1. Where do you have true "real-time" under linux? Kernel or user space?
2. Where would you put the firmware for an DSP? Far away or as near to 
hardware as possible?
3. How do you synchronize devices on non real time system?
4. Why the hell do we have whole network protocols inside the kernel? 
Couldn't those
be perfectly handled in user space? Or maybe there are good reasons?
5. Should a driver just basically map the hardware to the user space or 
shouldn't
it perhaps provide abstraction from the actual hardware implementing it?
6. Is there really a conceptual difference between a DSP+CPU+driver and 
just
looking at the MMX IP core of the CPU as an DSP?
