In fact you want sometimes to get the pid for not the main thread. Of course
you'll need some info about process internals for that info to be usefull but
sometimes it's REALLY usefull. And ability to send signal in ONE thread is
usefull as well. And if you do not want to see all this stuff modification to
ps can solve this :-)) So it's not a point...
