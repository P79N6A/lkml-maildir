No its a page fault benchmark. Dave Miller has done some kernel compiles
and I have some benchmarks here that I never posted because they do not
show any material change as far as I can see. I will be posting that soon
when this is complete (also need to do the same for the atomic page fault
ops and the prefaulting patch).

That is all already controllable in the same way as the swapper. Each
memory node is bound to a set of cpus. This may be controlled by the
NUMA node configuration. F.e. for nodes without cpus.
