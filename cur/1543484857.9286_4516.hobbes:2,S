Cool.  I'll try that if it turns out that's the only way.

No, my modeline is exactly the same as it was.  If I boot up with a
text console, X reads the modeline and does 70Hz like it's supposed to 
but if I boot up with the ATY driver, X reads the same modeline but
does 60Hz instead.  All this as reported by my monitor (and it's easy
to tell anyway, since 60Hz is much worse than 70Hz).
