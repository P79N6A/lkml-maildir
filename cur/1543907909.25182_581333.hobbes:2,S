Jan,
Looks like there is a lot of code duplication b/n lookup_hash versions and
real_lookup versions for union mounts. Is there a reason for doing it
this way? I believe that with a little effort we should be able to get
rid of the above hash_lookup_union() completely and can instead use
real_lookup_union() variants from lookup_hash() also.
The reason I say this is, I can't see any _real_ difference b/n
real_lookup() and __lookup_hash_kern().  While the former does a seqlock
protected(for concurrent renames) dcache lookup followed by a ->lookup(),
the latter does an extra lock free dcache lookup, followed by seqlock
protected dcache lookup and a ->lookup() on failure.
Do you want me to cook up a patch for this Jan ?
Aside from that, it would help if someone could throw some light on the history
of __lookup_hash_kern. I wonder why real_lookup wasn't be used instead.
Regards,
Bharata.
