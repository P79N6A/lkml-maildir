So if all the applications using markers are shoved into the kernel
source tree you are happy, and if they are distributed elsewhere you are
not ?
Or do you want a single controlled 'with the kernel' tool for doing the
outputting which alone has close links with the kernel (ie modinfo
--dump-markers) or similar ?
