Hmm, I've been having a similar problem for ages.  If I just do "ls" in
my home directory 10 or 20 times, approximately 20% of the time it's
"fast":
real    0m0.177s
user    0m0.028s
sys     0m0.027s
And the rest of the times it's "slow":
real    0m1.240s
user    0m0.036s
sys     0m0.040s
I rarely get anything in between - it's either ~1.2s or ~0.2s.
"time ls | cat" is always fast - 0.18 - 0.35s.
real    0m0.188s
user    0m0.014s
sys     0m0.018s
It has been this way as long as I can remember and it never made
sense...
