ye olde generic x86 SMP box, the interrupt handling imbalance came about 
with the P4 and their newer APIC setup did it not? Although i am aware 
that some x86 SMP boxes don't do the distribution properly too, thats why 
i reckon config option would be best.

Understandable, i agree not many people run 2.5 and it would help if it 
got into 2.4-ac for testing purposes.

<Disclaimer>
I am not a NUMAQ expert and do not even have access to one for testing
</Disclaimer>
The addressing mode, irq_balance assumes that the addressing mode is 
logical mode (when programming the IOREDTBL entries), whilst NUMAQ uses a 
completely different addressing architecture. Also another thing is 
consider this situation;
irqbalance programs IOAPIC#0 on node0 to deliver to CPU#6 on node1
Will that interrupt get delivered?
