Just for grins, I shutdown my system which had been up for 12+ hours
with no lockups and changed the CPU to PCI Write Buffer back on and
rebooted. The first time, I didn't even get all the way into GNOME
before it locked up when GNOME's startup sound played on the sound card.
I reset the system, came back up, did a lscfg from the console, went
back into X and started XMMS and netscape on different virtual desktops
in Enlightenment. Quickly switched desktops back and forth a couple
times, locked up. I then reset the system and turned that darned option
off and did the same thing dozens and dozens of times, still up. Just in
case someone is wondering, I have also tested the system on KDE using
XMMS with the same results.
I attached a lspci-v-hang.txt and lspci-v-nohang.txt. They are the same.
No changes here.
