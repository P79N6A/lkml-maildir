This is my problem.  You could help if you could tell me what exactly 
are the magic wands to wave such that you can ssh in without typing
a password.  I know about ssh-agent but that doesn't help for this, 
I know that in certain cases ssh lets me in without anything.  I thought
there was some routine where you ssh-ed one way and then the other way
and it left enough state that it trusted you, does any ssh genuis out 
there know what I'm talking about?  If I have this, I can set up the
cron job, I'm sure this is obvious and I'm just overlooking something
but I can't find it.

Yeah, I did it by hand.  Hopefully automated by the end of the day.
