Hehe yeah - but as I said, I'd just committed it to the wrong repository, 
so the next step was to undo the changeset from that one anyway. 
Then as a sanity check, 'bk send' it from the repository to which I'd
transplanted it, compare with the original results of 'bk send' of the 
same changeset from the original tree, blow away everything and 
'bk receive' the changeset into a fresh clone of the proper tree.
Mutter ye not - at least I ditched the idea of copying the SCCS files, 
removing the 'dD' lines which seem to mean they're part of a committed 
changeset, then making a new changeset from the 'pending' deltas :)
