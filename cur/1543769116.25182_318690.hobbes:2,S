What about IMAP? You could ask for just the parents for several messages
(via a message header), then start asking for message bodies (with the
juicy stuff in). You could also ask for a list of the new commits then
ask for each of the bodies (several at a time). Not as good as a "Just
give me all new data", but an *awful* lot more efficient than HTTP. And
very flexible. You just need to map changesets to IMAP messages (if such
a mapping can actually make sense :)
Prolly a bit more work though.
