No, for the reason I specified above. We still walk entire region on page by
page basis, checking that page is not covered by other locks that might warrant
its exclusion from truncating, pushing writing of the page if it is still dirty
and needs to be written (or clearing its dirty flag if it needs to be
discarded).
So we have sort of reimplemented truncate_inode_pages_range() with extra logic
specific to Lustre and calling truncate_inode_pages_range() for every page
we want to get rid of is overkill.

Not that I mind if it is GPL or not, but currently truncate_complete_page()
can be reimplemented with EXPORT_SYMBOL stuff only. Here's how:
static inline void ll_remove_from_page_cache(struct page *page)
{
        struct address_space *mapping = page->mapping;
        BUG_ON(!PageLocked(page));
        write_lock_irq(&mapping->tree_lock);
        radix_tree_delete(&mapping->page_tree, page->index);
        page->mapping = NULL;
        mapping->nrpages--;
        atomic_add(-1, &nr_pagecache); // XXX pagecache_acct(-1);
        write_unlock_irq(&mapping->tree_lock);
}
static inline void
truncate_complete_page(struct address_space *mapping, struct page *page)
{
        if (page->mapping != mapping)
                return;
        if (PagePrivate(page))
                page->mapping->a_ops->invalidatepage(page, 0);
        clear_page_dirty(page);
        ClearPageUptodate(page);
        ClearPageMappedToDisk(page);
        ll_remove_from_page_cache(page);
        page_cache_release(page);       /* pagecache ref */
}
Bye,
    Oleg
