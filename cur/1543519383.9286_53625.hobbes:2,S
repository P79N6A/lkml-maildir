Subject: Kernel Config question--PAE & nopentium?  PAE & i386?

It is currently permitted for a mem=nopentium option to be handed to a
PAE-enabled kernel.  Now technically, nopentium "merely" turns off 4M pages,
but it seems "wrong" to me anyway.  I am more than a little inclined to
forbid "nopentium" on PAE-enabled kernels.
While we're at it, I see no exclusion from selecting PAE on an i386 (or
i486), which also strikes me as being rather wrong.
Thoughts?
