But it is not such rare either. If I happen to have bsd-subpartitions,
slices, and dos-subpartitions ,extended partitions, then the ID's tend to
jump in the current implementation. BSD here's just an example, it could 
be Solaris slices, or mac stuff, or Minix, or maybe even future raw 
(sub-)paritions.
You suggest to solve this problem to assign 'slice' to bsd-style
sub-partitions.
I think that it would be much simpler to just decide that whatever is
inside of a primary partition be it 'dos extended partition' or a 'bsd
slices' or whatever else like Minix. should have their own ID. I think
that we can just call them 'slices'. If there's no slices it would be 
just 's0' or we could skip it altogether.
Thus the only change over what you had suggested already
would be that 'dos extended partition' would be named a 'slice'. 
Thus the current design:
  controller
  bus           (aka. primary/secondary)
  target        (aka. master/slave)
  unit
  partition     (DOS primary or logical)
  slice         (Solaris/*BSD slices)
would change to ([*] means changed):
  controller
	bus           (aka. primary/secondary)
	target        (aka. master/slave)
  unit
	partition     (DOS primary/BSD disklabel/??)			  [*]
  	slice         (Solaris/*BSD slices/DOS logical/MINIX sub-part/??) [*]
I think in this way we have most flexibility and we are sure that the
"ID"'s won't accidentally jump if we change something else, semingly
unrelated.
Comments?
