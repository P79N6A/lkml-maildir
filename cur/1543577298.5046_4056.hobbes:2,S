extern u_int32_t eax;
extern u_int32_t ecx;
{
	u_int32_t *ptr;
	ptr = (u_int32_t *)((eax * 4) + 0x400dec);
	ecx ^= *ptr;
}
Commonly used in the above form (with a fixed displacement) to access a
32bit value within an array of 32bit values.
The array start offset would be hardwired at 0x400dec, the zero based
index into the array is provided by eax.
