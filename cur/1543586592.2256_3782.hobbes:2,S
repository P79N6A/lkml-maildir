I use reiserfs on
a) P3(450) machine 440BX/ZX Chipset 82371AB PIIX4 IDE UDMA33
b) athlon(1100) VIA KT133 something IDE UDMA33
On both of them i have spurious small file garbage problems
during compiling.
There was no situation with real trouble, no permanent damage,
restarting the job solved the problem all the time.
I could not find a real corrupt file on disk.
It seems to me like the corruption happens in memory only.
(just an impression)
The machine with less memory triggers it more likely.
On 2.4.3-pre6 a file that has not been changed for months
was sometimes not found.
I have no problems on the ext2 partitions.
