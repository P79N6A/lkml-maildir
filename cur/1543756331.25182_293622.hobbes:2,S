So this permits ELSA to maintain a complete picture of the process/thread
hierarchy?  I guess that fits into the "do it in userspace" mantra -
certainly hooking into fork() is a minimal way of doing this, although I
wonder what the limitations are.
Implementation-wise: there's a lot of code there and the interface is a bit
awkward.  Why not just feed that kobject you have there into
kobject_uevent()?
