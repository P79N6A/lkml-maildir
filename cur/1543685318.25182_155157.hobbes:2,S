And I know you know a lot more about how real processes behave than I 
do.  I'm not saying (or thinking) anything negative about you.  I'm just 
trying to throw random thoughts into the mix just in case some small 
part of what I say is useful inspiration for someone else such as yourself.
It is probably the case that the idea I suggest is BS and makes no real 
difference or makes it worse anyhow.  :)
