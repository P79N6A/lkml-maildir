I have the same problem in two different machines but they both are UP.
However, my kernel configuration has SMP support enabled.
My modules.conf file is:
alias scsi_hostadapter ppa
alias parport_lowlevel parport_pc
options parport_pc io=0x378 irq=7

I stop klogd and syslogd services (that causes to display all kernel
messages on screen, doesn't it? and, when I load the ppa modules, the
machine simply hangs: no messages, no sysreq key anymore.
