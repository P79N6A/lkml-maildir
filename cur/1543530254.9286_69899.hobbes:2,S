Ehh... Isn't the ide-scsi question asked before the SCSI question?
(It was so a year a go, and the only way to "solve" this, was by
 adding a #warning / #error to it, you should be able to find it in the 
 code)
Forward-dependencies ARE a big problem for the current Config.in system,
and the only way to solve them (this is not the only one) is to add a second
pass to the config scripts. (It can be done, my patch just didn't make it
into the kernel).
