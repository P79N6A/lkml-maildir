Hi,
Can someone tell me how to get knfsd to work on 2.1.131?  I guess I'm
missing something obvious -- I can't get it to work.  I'm also using the
knfsd-981204 utilities that go along with it.
I want to try this out, because my sparc solaris systems keep getting
"NFS server not responding keep trying" messages when ever I try to use
a file system mounted from Linux.  My other Linux boxes don't have any
problems talking to the Linux NFS server.
Thanks.
TTFN - Guy
