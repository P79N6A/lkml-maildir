Not silly, but probably completely wrong.  The "unknown" is the output
of the "uname -p" command on Intel/Linux machines.  The configure
scripts don't do any initial tests, by assembling or compiling code,
except Alpha and MIPS.  The "uname -p" option is supposed to result in
the processor, which actually (on my Pentium) is supplied by "uname
-m".  If the individual distributions supply their vendor-specific
name--which has nothing to do with the libraries--then any
distribution that substitutes their own label is not POSIX compliant.
But I haven't looked at the POSIX standard at all, nor autoconf very
closely
