This changelog ought to be a little more extensive; esp. because you're
using these fancy new functions ->page_mkwrite() and page_mkclean() in a
novel way.
Also, I'd still like to see a way to call msync() on the mmap'ed region
to force a flush. I think providing a fb_fsync() method in fbmem.c and a
hook down to the driver ought to work.
Also, you now seem to use a fixed 1 second delay, perhaps provide an
ioctl or something to customize this?
And, as Andrew suggested last time around, could you perhaps push this
fancy new idea into the FB layer so that more drivers can make us of it?
