Unfortunately the nvidia bits are a showstopper; we just can't know
anything about the internals like we do for un-tainted kernels, so
you have to go to nvidia about such things.
Alternatively, if you can reproduce it while the kernel is untainted
(without nvidia) then we can get an idea of what might be going on.
