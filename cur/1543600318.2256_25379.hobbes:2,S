All,
I've noticed an anomaly, and am not sure which behavior is correct:
sysctl_string() stores the value it reads to table->data
sysctl_intvec() validates but does not store the value it reads
whereas
proc_intvec() does store the intvec it reads, but does not validate
proc_dostring() stores the string it read
Should sysctl_intvec() be storing the data, or should sysctl_string() NOT? 
Or is this oddness by design?
Also, what is the typical answer to a sysctl variable that is essentially
an enum?  Ideally the /proc interface can show it as a meaningful string,
but should the sysctl() interface pass the integer values (cleaner)? 
Should I toss an enum into sysctl.h ?
Tim
