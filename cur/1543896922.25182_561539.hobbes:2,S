In my naive little mpscless bubbleworld, I am believing that this is a
pretty important fix, and that people in an mpscful world might want it in
2.6.22.  And even in 2.6.21.x.
But alas, that's just a guess, which was forced upon me by the lack of
suitable information in your changelog.
So please, tell us what are the real-world consequences of your patch (or
the lack of it), thanks.
