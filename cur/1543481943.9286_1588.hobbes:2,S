Has anyone gotten this to work on an AOpen AX59Pro (VIA MPV3 chipset) with
Award 1.1 BIOS?  I consistently get a pair of Oopsen when halt -p is run
(sysvinit 2.76).  Are there any particular options in the BIOS I need to
set for this to work?  I have CONFIG_APM and CONFIG_APM_POWER_OFF
configured.
Win98 seems to do this just fine, even if it can't do much else right.
Thanks for any help,
Danek
