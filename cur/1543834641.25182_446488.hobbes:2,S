In this case it isn't quite that simple...
The DVB tree is in the midst of tuner refactoring, and somehow the diff
was generated against the wrong tree.
The fix can be found here... We'll need this queued up for 2.6.17.8 ...
 I have already attached this inline in a prior email, not sure how many
people have seen that yet...
You can also get it from here:

[PATCH 2.6.17.7] Fix budget-av compile failure
From: Andrew de Quincey <adq_dvb@lidskialf.net>
Currently I am doing lots of refactoring work in the dvb tree. This
bugfix became necessary to fix 2.6.17 whilst I was in the middle of this
work. Unfortunately after I tested the original code for the patch, I
generated the diff against the wrong tree (I accidentally used a tree
with part of the refactoring code in it). This resulted in the reported
compile errors because that tree (a) was incomplete, and (b) used
features which are simply not in the mainline kernel yet.
Many apologies for the error and problems this has caused. :(
