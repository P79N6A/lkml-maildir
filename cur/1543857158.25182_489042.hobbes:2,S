Well, this only happened once, out of about 20 or 30 reboots,
so i can't really tell.
In my first mail, i said that i had another similar oops,upon boot in 2.6.18.2,
though code path looks different, so that may be a totally other issue.
(I compiled some modules into the kernel, when i switched to 2.6.19)
I found the picture i took at the time:

Config's here:

Thanks Andrew, for taking the time to have a look.
