This is right.
Though, to make situation more clean explain me one much simpler thing:
look at these lines from beginning of my lspnp -v:
00 PNP0c01 System board
        mem 0x00000000-0x0009ffff
        mem 0x00100000-0x0bfdffff
        mem 0x0bfe0000-0x0bfeffff
        mem 0x000e0000-0x000fffff
        mem 0xffff0000-0xffffffff
Look at line mem 0x0bfe0000-0x0bfeffff. I hope you never saw this
motherboard before, like this happens with our poor kernel,
so you are not in better position. Imagine, you are kernel,
and decide are you allowed to use these 64K or not? :-)
Additional information: bios-e820 reports this area as ram in one block
with all the rest of memory 0x00100000-0x0bfeffff.
