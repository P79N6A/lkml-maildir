I just found similar problem. After 2.3.26 I cannot use any kernel.
just because  it founds only one of my ne2000 nicks.
I use usual ne driver (non PCI) with 1 ISA and 2 PCI cards. Strangely
enough it finds one my PCI card after 2.3.28.desplite the fact I have
append="ether=0,0x340,eth0 ehter=0,0,eth1 ehter=0,0,eth2" in
lilo.conf.
Bye,
