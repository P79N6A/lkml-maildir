Sorry, won't fix it here :)
a) I don't run gpm, almost always in X.
b) with this particular cardbus NIC, networking doesn't work.
as a matter of fact, inserting this cardbus linksys tulip card now gives an
immediate OOPS and about 5 seconds of scroll and the ssytem becomes useless.
with the linksys ne2k nic/modem combo, in a few kernels back, if i booted
with the card inserted, it wouldn't work and X keyb/mouse wouldn't work. 
but if i booted then inserted it, it would work.  also, if i inserted it
secondary to my already inserted aviator 2.2 wireless nic, it wouldn't work.
