I've already put out a patch which tries to fix this problem,
once we've established that it indeed works as advertised and
doesn't have bad side effects, I'll ask Alan to integrate it:
http://www.surriel.com/patches/2.4/2.4.10-ac9-eatcache
The patch applies cleanly to at least 2.4.10-ac9 and -ac10,
maybe a few others too.
It would be nice to know if this patch fixes the problems for
you, if it does there's another reason to ask Alan to integrate
it ... if it doesn't I'll try to make it work before sending
the thing to Alan.
regards,
Rik
