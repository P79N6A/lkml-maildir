Your point is valid, and I thought of this too.  The one problem with it
is that it is not immune to problems in the scheduler itself (which at
the time, I thought I was chasing..turned out to be lockdep), but that
is probably a rarity.  In any case, we have been using it on a number of
debug systems here for a few weeks and the console continues to work
well in all functions besides sysrq, believe it or not (*).  But I don't
see this as being anything used for real.  Just thought I would throw it
out there in case it was useful or inspired someone to give it some
love.

(*) The trick is that once it figures out its not for sysrq, it
schedules a (kthread based) tasklet to do the actual tty() callbacks.
