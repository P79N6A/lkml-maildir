This first patch is wrong.  lv_block_exception needs translating
because the types are of a different size on sparc32 than on sparc64.
Specifically the first member of lv_block_exception_t is
'struct list_head', which are two pointers, which is 8 bytes
on sparc32 and 16 bytes on sparc64.
Please do not apply these patches.
Franks a lot,
