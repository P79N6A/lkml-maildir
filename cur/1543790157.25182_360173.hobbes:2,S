It certainly won't all be merged as soon as 2.6.14 is out, some of it
has only just got into -mm.  Andrew's current intention is to merge
the early part of the changes soonish after 2.6.14 gets out, but he's
not likely to merge it all into 2.6.15.
But we aren't using -mm as a playground: it is likely to go forward,
provided it doesn't show regressions of some kind while it's in -mm.

I'd recommend -mm for now.  page_mkwrite will want a spell in there
too, won't it?
