	Forwarded to airo maintainer.
	Javier :
	Most drivers collect stats based on Tx/Rx packets (they just
increment counters). Look at other driver for details. If you really
want to get stats out of the firmware, you may use the techinique I
used in orinoco for wireless stats, which is to use previous stats and
only call async the stat function.
	Have fun...
