Don't Do That then.  lock_kiobuf can be called if some caller really
wants the kiobuf pages locked, but kiobuf page mapping is much cleaner
in 2.4 than it had to be in 2.2 and there's no need to keep pages
locked during the mapping.  raw IO doesn't ever use lock_kiobuf in
2.4.

Correct.  The raw IO code for 2.2 had to exempt zero pages from
locking for this reason.
Cheers,
 Stephen
