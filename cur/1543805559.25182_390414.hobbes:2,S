We might want to add a new class in sysfs, except we do not allow a
device to belong to several classes (we require splittiing it into
sub-devices which is not entirely correct in case of DVD+-RW which
should belong to classes CD, DVD, DVD-RW, OTOH maybe it is sane to
treat it as 3 different sub-devices in one
physical package).
