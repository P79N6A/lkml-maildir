Daniel,
The procedure described is _identical_ if you want to access 1TiB at a 
time, because the request is broken down by the VFS into 512 byte size 
units and I think I explained that, too. And for _each_ 512 byte sized unit 
of those 1TiB you would have to repeat the _whole_ of the described 
procedure. So just replace 1 byte with 512 bytes in my post and then repeat 
the procedure as many times as it takes to make up the 1TiB. Surely you 
should know this... just fundamental Linux kernel VFS operation.
It is not clear to me he understands the concept at all. He thinks that you 
need to read the disk inode just once and then you immediately read all the 
1TiB of data and somehow all this magic is done by the VFS. This is 
complete crap and is _NOT_ how the Linux kernel works. The VFS breaks every 
request into super block->s_blocksize sized units and _each_ and _every_ 
request is _individually_ looked up as to where it is on disk.
Each of those lookups requires a lot of seeks, reads, memory allocations, 
etc. Just _read_ my post...
Please, I really wouldn't have expected someone like you to come up with a 
statement like that... You really should know better...
Best regards,
         Anton
