Greg,
I have finished the cleanup and port to 2.5 for the OS2 plugin. AIX has also 
gone through some cursory cleanup, and the #ifdef's you mentioned should be 
gone. If you're still interested, please take a look and let me know if that 
is more along the lines of what you are looking for. The 390 plugin will 
hopefully come tomorrow.
