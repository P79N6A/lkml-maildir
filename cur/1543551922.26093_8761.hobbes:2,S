So if I write a mechanism that allows those driver-private-pages that are used
for DMA of a soundcard to be swapped out, then you would remove the
PG_referenced bitflag from them too?
What sense it has to start to writeout to disk a page that is under DMA when
you don't know if this page is getting changed under the swapout? Furthmore
despite of the swapout I/O those pages can't be freed until we run unmap_kiobuf.

(minor note: that's not PCI space (the pci space case is handled by the
!VALID_PAGE(page) check). That's normal kernel memory exported to userspace
handled by the PageReserved(page) check.)
