That does sound troublesome, especially since it's difficult to queue up
the kinds of extended stress tests needed to demonstrate the problems.
The prolonged memory pressure and so on are things that we've
unfortunately had to wait until extended runtime in production to see. =(
The underutilization bit is actually why I keep going on and on about
the pinned pagecache relocation; it resolves a portion of the problem
of pinned pages in lower zones without underutilizing RAM, then once
pinned user pages can arbitrarily utilize lower zones, pinned kernel
allocations (which would not be relocatable) can be denied fallback
entirely without overall underutilization. I've actually already run
out of ideas here, so just people just saying what they want me to
write might help. Tests can be easily contrived (e.g. fill a swapless
box' upper zones with file-backed pagecache, then start allocating
anonymous pages), but realistic situations are much harder to trigger.
