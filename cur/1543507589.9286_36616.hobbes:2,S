     News server which is a Sun SS-10 with quad Ross RTK-625 CPU's, 256MB of
RAM, running 2.2.12 locked up, repeatively printing the following on the
console: 
spin_lock (f0158c7c) CPU#1 stuck at f00499f0, owner PC(f002de44):CPU(2)
	.
	.
	over and over again
     A previous lock-up printed a very similar message:
spin_lock (f0158c7c) CPU#1 stuck at f00499f0, owner PC(f002de44):CPU(3)
     As you can see, the only difference is the CPU involved.
     Relevant System.map entries:
f0158c7c -----> f0158c7c D kernel_flag
		f00499c8 T sys_write
f00499f0 -----> No exact match.	
		f0049b74 t do_readv_writev
		f002dda8 T patchme_store_new_current
f002de44 -----> No exact match.

     Here is my .config:
     It's a pretty minimal kernel.
