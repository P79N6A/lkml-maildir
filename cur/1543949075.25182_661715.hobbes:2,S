AFAIK, POSIX.1 makes no requirement here.  Most (all?) Unix systems have 
traditionally placed argv+environ just above the stack, but that isn't 
required.
My reading of POSIX.1 (and POSIX doesn't seem very explicit on this 
point), is that the limits on argv+environ and on stack are decoupled, 
since POSIX specifies RLIMIT_STACK and sysconf(_SC_ARG_MAX) and doesn't 
specify any relationship between the two.
