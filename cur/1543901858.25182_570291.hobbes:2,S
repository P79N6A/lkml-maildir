My process was to start with 2.4.34 sources (that compiled
fine), applied the 2.4.34.[1-5] patches and then the 2.4.35.rc5.
I didnt patch the patches. I changed a jmp reference to a
non-existent label to the correct label, in the one file that
complained at build time.
So have to repeat the full process, again.  Will let you know...
