A user being out of (memory) resources shares many of the same problems of
a system that is OOM. You still need to kill one or more user processes,
and you can't give the user the choice, because the user might decide to
keep on running.

Precisely.

Preventing system OOM using resource limits is equivalent to disabling
overcommit. You have to restrict each of N users to 1/N of the total
system memory.
