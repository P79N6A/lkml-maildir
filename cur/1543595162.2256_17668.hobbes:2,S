You are partially correct.  AIX (Advanced Interactive eXecutive) was built 
by the Boston office of Interactive Systems under contract to IBM.  We had 
a maximum of 17 people in the effort which shipped on the RT in January 
1986.
Prior to that time, Interactive Systems had produced a port of System III 
running on the PC/XT called PC/IX which was sold via IBM.  I used PC/IX to 
produce the software only floating point code in the first version of AIX.
