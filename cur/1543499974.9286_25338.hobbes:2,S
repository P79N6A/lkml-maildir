	Hello,
	I've just backed up my whole system, mainly because I need to
repartition the disk, (no more windows on my box), and before partition it I
decide to live dangerously for a while, so I download lates CVS sanpshot of
egcs (19990616) and the new 2.3.7 (I used to run development kernels but with
2.3.5 I went back to 2.2.x). I compile gcc-2.95 and then try to compile the
kernel with it, I use -march=pentiumpro and -O3 -fomit-frame-pointer and
surprise! it works (well it almost works as it seems that no all filesystems
has been updated to the new scheme, for example msdos, isofs, nfs don't work)
	Keeping my new style of life I download binutils-2.9.4.0.5 and 
compile it under the new kernel/compiler combo, it works without 
problems, but the impressive thing was that the next thing I tried was 
of course the BIG glibc-2.1.1 and it compiles perfectly, no only perfect 
but really fast, I configured it with --enable-shared --enable-profile 
--enable-static --enable-debug --enable-omitfp (changing the -O99 to -O3) 
and it took my dual PII 450 about 20 minutes to compile it, the output of 
time make was:
1851.160u 421.850s 20:27.69 185.1%      0+0k 0+0io 748690500pf+0w
just impressive.
	Good work!
	- german
PS: If you know of any more benchmark to try the new speeds up mail me, 
I'll be living dangerously for about two or three days :-)
