Hello!
I have a BIG problem with 2.4.x kernels.
With 2.4.x kernel my system (Celeron (Coppermine) 850Mhz (100x8.5)
256Mb i810) behaves like slow i386sx.
For example, when I extract 25MB gzip file on 2.2.19 kernel - it
takes about 12 seconds, but with 2.4.8(9) - 6(!) MINUTES on the SAME
system...
The only idea is that 2.4.x kernel turns off cache (L1 & L2) on
processor (on my cpu). How can I check it? Any ideas?
