Indeed, there's no reason to ever write pure code pages into swap space
since you can just page them from the original image.  Only writable pages
should ever swap out; if an executable page's page frame is reclaimed then
the page should just be unmapped and forgotten, to be reread from the
image when faulted in.  So you couldn't ever get to a state in which the
disk containing the image could be umounted while the image is running,
because it will always be busy.
