The biggest problem I see is that the inlines are done in header files
generally,  and to stop them from inlining,  you need to be able to
switch from an inline to a prototype in the header file.  The code from
the header then needs to be added to a .o somewhere in the build for the
case where inlines are stripped out.
Other than providing non-critical inlines either on or off,  I can't see
the level approach working all that well.  A combination of levels that
work well on a few platforms may not work well at all on another.
Still, just the ability to reduce the inlines would be very useful.
