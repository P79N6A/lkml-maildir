2.4.9 of course has the newstyle pci interface! And actual hotplug
PCI support also is in all today singnificant 2.4.9 forks (RH..).
There's even some shim to emulate the pci_driver style interface on
2.2.
Anyway, this table has another use, it's used by userland ools like
installers for selecting the right driver for a given pci device.  So
even if it seems unused from kernelspace it has a use.
