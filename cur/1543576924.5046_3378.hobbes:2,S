Another thing: while writing to disk if you want low latency readers you can
do:
	elvtune -r 1 /dev/hd[abcd]
The 1/2 seconds stalls you see could be just because of applications that waits
I/O synchronously while the elevator is reodering I/O requests (and even if the
elevator wouldn't reorder anything the new requests would go to the end of the
I/O queue so they would have some higher latency anyways). That's normal and if
it's the case to avoid those stalls you can only decrease the I/O load or
increase disk throughput ;). The important thing is that the kernel is
not sitting in a tight kernel loop without reschedule in it during such 2
seconds.
However 2.2.19pre3aa4 includes also the lowlatency bugfixes in case you have
tons of ram and you're sending huge buffers to syscalls.
