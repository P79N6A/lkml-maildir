Yup.  The logics being:
if we have neither CONFIG_NFSD nor CONFIG_NFSD_MODULE
	sys_nfsservctl() is alias for sys_ni_syscall()
else
	sys_nfsservctl() is defined in fs/nfsct.c and does do_kern_mount()
	with type "nfsd", which triggers autoload if nfsd is modular.  Whether
	nfsd is modular or comipled-in, syscall itself is in kernel (and
	is nothing but a wrapper for write()/read()).
