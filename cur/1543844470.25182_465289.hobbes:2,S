7zip (LZMA) decompresses quickly, and the decompressor text is actually 
smaller than the equivalent for gzip.  Quite nice.
What is not nice is the code for the compressor, which is a total mess. 
  I have been holding out on implementing LZMA on kernel.org, because 
just as zip (deflate) didn't become common in the Unix world until an 
encapsulation format that handles things expected in the Unix world, 
e.g. streaming, was created (gzip), I don't think LZMA is going to be 
widely used until there is an "lzip" which does the same thing.  I 
actually started the work of adding LZMA support to gzip, but then 
realized it would be better if a new encapsulation format with proper 
64-bit support everywhere was created.
