Subject: [PATCH] gcc4 fix for sn_serial.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The sal_console and sal_console_uart structures have a circular relationship 
since they both initialize member fields to pointers of one another.  The 
current code forward declares sal_console_uart as extern so that sal_console 
can take its address, but gcc4 complains about this since the real definition 
of sal_console_uart is marked 'static'.  This patch just removes the static 
qualifier from sal_console_uart to avoid the inconsistency.  Does it look ok 
to you, Pat?
