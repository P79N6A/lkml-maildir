Agreed that this is not very clean. The problem is that we cannot be sure
about the interrupt state at this point as the low level idle handlers at
this point can come from variety of different places like safe_halt, arch
dependent pm_idle code (which is different for (32 and 64 bit at this point)
and also pm_idle can be somewhere outside the kernel in some module as it is
a function pointer.
