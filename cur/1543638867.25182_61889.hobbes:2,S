OK, thanks for looking at it. Maybe the zfcp developers can
find a less intrusive way of getting the driver to work
if they want it to work out of the box.

The other new drivers I sent (lcs, z90crypt and qdio) and some of 
the s390 stuff that's already in 2.4 are not really any better.
These three have all been closed source before and you can see
them as a warning of what happens to your code if you skip
public peer review ;-)
Still, it's the stuff IBM recommends for use and it's not going
away (at least not in 2.4), so I guess it might just as well be 
included.
OTOH, if Marcello wants to the next patch size small, it might be
a good idea to leave out the uglier drivers.
