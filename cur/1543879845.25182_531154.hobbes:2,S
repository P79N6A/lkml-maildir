Hi Tejun,
I started looking at these patches and parallely also did some testing on a 
8 CPU system. I am using the patches from Greg's tree at
http://www.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/patches.git/
I ran following loops parallelly
# while true; do insmod drivers/net/dummy.ko; sleep 1;rmmod dummy; done
# while true; do find /sys/class/net/dummy0 | xargs cat; sleep 1; done
# while true; do umount /sys; sleep 1; mount -t sysfs none /sys; done
# while true; do find /sys | xargs cat > /dev/null; sleep 1; done
and got the following oops
