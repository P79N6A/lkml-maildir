When updating, make certain that you are looking at the test driver version
as well
     
ftp://www.scyld.com/pub/network/test/via-rhine.c
The updated driver has the line
	if ((np->drv_flags & ReqTxAlign)  && (long)skb->data & 3) {
		/* Must use alignment buffer. */
Note the following name change: this new 3065 chip is really the Rhine-II.
VIA claims that the 6100 never happened.. MmmK.

The 'mii-diag' programs and others can now have the same effect as setting
the options= and full_duplex= module options, or reverse the effect.
I've made this change to all drivers with MII transceivers or MII register
emulation.
