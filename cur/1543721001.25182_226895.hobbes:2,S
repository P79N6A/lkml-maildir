Here is the culprit (include/asm-i386/i387.h):
#define __clear_fpu( tsk )					\
do {								\
	if ((tsk)->thread_info->status & TS_USEDFPU) {		\
		asm volatile("fwait");				\
		(tsk)->thread_info->status &= ~TS_USEDFPU;	\
		stts();						\
	}							\
} while (0)
This is called in flush_thread() (which is used in flush_old_exec()
and therefore in sys_execve() path) and in restore_i387_fsave(),
restore_i387_fxsave() (which are reached from sys_sigreturn() and
sys_rt_sigreturn()).
The buggy code in the Stian's program corrupts the FPU state - in
particular, it results in some exception bits being set in the FPU
status word.  In this state the next FP command (except non-waiting
commands, like fnsave and fninit) will raise the FP error exception
(trap 16).  The "fwait" above happens to be that next command.
The FP error handler do_coprocessor_error() calls math_error() for
real work (both in arch/i386/traps.c).  math_error() calls
save_init_fpu(), which saves the FPU state in current->thread.i387 and
sets the TS flag; then math_error() queues a SIGFPE to the task and
returns.  If the fault comes from userspace, this is enough - on the
return path the pending signal will be noticed and delivered.
However, in this case the fault happens in the kernel code, therefore
execution just resumes at the same point - trying to reexecute that
fwait again.
At this time, however, the TS flag is set, so we get another trap -
trap 7, device_not_available.  The trap handler calls
math_state_restore(), which clears the TS flag and reloads the FP
state from current->thread.i387.  Then it returns, and the faulting
instruction is restarted again.  But it gets the same FP error
exception as at the first time...
So the CPU is stuck handling endless faults in kernel mode.
How to fix this?  A quick and dirty fix is to remove the problematic
fwait from __clear_fpu(); 2.2.x kernels did not have it - probably it
was added in some 2.3.x.

In this case we will ignore a pending FP exception at execve() or
sigreturn() instead of raising SIGFPE (which was probably intended by
whoever put an fwait there).
If we want to be pedantic and care about such pending exceptions, we
should add a check for kernel addresses to do_coprocessor_error() and
add fixup_exception there, like we do for protection faults, so that
the handler will not attempt to restart the failing instruction again.
