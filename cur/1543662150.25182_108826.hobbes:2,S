(Note - second-hand info from somebody else who looked at MMX/SSE to optimize
an inner loop.  Double-check with CPU documentation).
There's a big "urp" sound as the processor switches from FP to MMX mode and
back, which apparently takes a large number of cycles.  You can to some extent
amortize this if you're switching once for a LONG loop (the analysis I saw was
with a million or so pixels on a screen image) - if you're switching in and out
for a 1500 byte packet (or even worse, a 100-byte packet) the impact may be
more noticable. You may wish to examine the SSE/SSE2 opcodes, which apparently
don't take this performance hit.
