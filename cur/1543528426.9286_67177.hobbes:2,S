it actually makes a huge difference as the _real_ optimization you missed
is the lack of cacheline ping-pongs, which pingpong inevitably happens if
globally shared spinlocks are used.

you have not actually checked the fast IRQ handling path, have you? The
IO-APIC level-triggered IRQ code does not use the lowlevel spinlock, at
all. This was one of the goals of the optimization.

check out the fast path of level-triggered PCI IRQs:
	do_IRQ()
	mask_and_ack_level_ioapic_irq: empty!
	->handler()
	end_level_ioapic_irq: a fast local-APIC write
no lowlevel spinlock taken. This is actually the case where the IOAPIC IRQ
hardware turned out to be very sane. The borken edge-triggered case is
nicely isolated.
