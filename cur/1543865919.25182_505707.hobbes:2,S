Could you try the patch below? The RCU serialization code (a rare call 
but can be common in some types of setups) has a nasty implicit 
dependency on the HZ tick - which until now was a hidden wart but became 
an explicit bug under dynticks. Maybe this is what is slowing down your 
box.

Subject: [patch] dynticks: make sure synchronize_rcu() completes
From: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
synchronize_rcu() has a nasty implicit dependency on the HZ tick: it 
relies on another CPU finishing all RCU work so that this CPU can finish 
its RCU work too - in IRQ context. But wait_for_completion() goes to 
sleep indefinitely on dynticks and there might be no other IRQs to this 
CPU for a long time.
