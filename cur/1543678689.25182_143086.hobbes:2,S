no, you have to make source available to anyone you give the binary to.
you can't prevent that person from giving the source to the world, but you
are not required to.
they could compress the source and stick it on the driver CD that they
bundle with the product and you would not be allowed to duplicate that CD
(it contains commercial programs), but you could copy the source off of
the CD and put it on your website.
