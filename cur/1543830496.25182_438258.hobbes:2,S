Subject: cpu_up not called for boot cpu

cpu_up() is only called for secondary cpus, not for the boot cpu.  That
means that code hooked into the cpu_chain notifier never gets called
for the boot cpu, which prevents additional subsystems from taking
action for the boot cpu.  So how are additional subsystems meant to be
initialised for the boot cpu?
