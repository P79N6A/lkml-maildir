Subject: 2.5.50 / compiling with frame pointers doesn't

As near as I can tell, compiling with frame pointers turned on doesn't
do anything. I had a quick look around in the Makefiles and found that
the test for CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER happens -before- the .config is
actually loaded, thereby resulting in it never being defined and so
-fomit-frame-pointer is always included.
Now I'm not too sure as the whole Makefile structure in the linux kernel
but the way I fixed this was by moving the test block down to be below
.config getting loaded rather then moving the .config load section up.
Not sure which is preferrable but here's my patch.
