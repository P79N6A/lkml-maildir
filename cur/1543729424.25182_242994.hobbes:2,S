/dev/tty is supposed to be char c 5 0, /class/tty/tty/dev will tell udev
how to create it, see man 4 tty.
No idea who came up with the bright idea to put legacy bsd devices in a
subdir. Documentation/devices.txt shows that my patch is ok, it handles
up to 256 device nodes.
If you are using udev, file a bugreport for your distros package. In the
meantime, remove the offending line from your udev.rules file.
