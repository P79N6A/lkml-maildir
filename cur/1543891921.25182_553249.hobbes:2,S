signalfd() doesn't deliver thread-targeted signals to the wrong threads,
does it?
Hmm.
It looks like reading from a signalfd will give you either
process-global signals or the thread-specific signals that are targeted
towards the thread that originally created the signalfd (regardless of
which thread actually calls read()).
Which is weird, to say the least. Definitely needs to be noted in the
man page, which doesn't seem to exist yet.
Is there a reason why signalfd() doesn't behave like regular signals in
this regard?
