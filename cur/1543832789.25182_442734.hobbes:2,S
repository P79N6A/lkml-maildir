Subject: [PATCH] msi: Only keep one msi_desc in each slab entry.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/7/10/357

It looks like someone confused kmem_cache_create with a different
allocator and was attempting to give it knowledge of how many cache
entries there were.
With the unfortunate result that each slab entry was big enough to
hold every irq.
