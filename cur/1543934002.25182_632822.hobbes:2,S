[Additional history snipped]
This is all true of course (and a useful history lesson to those not 
familiar with it) but what I wrote above is still true: due to the lack 
of synchronized memory (it doesn't have to be dual-ported, just 
synchronized, if it has enough bandwidth), most DOS applications *in the 
i386+ timeframe* just invoked the BIOS rather than dealing with the 
synchronization needs themselves (anything compiled with a Borland 
compiler using their conio library, for example.)
Hence the variety of software that poked directly at CGA/MDA as opposed 
to EGA/VGA was smaller, but I never claimed it was uncommon.
