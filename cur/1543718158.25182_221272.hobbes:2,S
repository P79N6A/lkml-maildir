Thanks,
Be aware of other problems when using the linux ramdisk driver,
loosing its contents. Especially the use of mkinitrd might result in 
unexpected problems. googling for "kernel 2.6.6 ramdisk problem" shows lots
of people with problems mounting their root filesystems and loading modules
from ramdisk. Klaus Knopper (knoppix) is not amused, neither am i :)
