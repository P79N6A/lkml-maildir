I think you ought to clear this with Dave.  He's been swamped with 2.4
work, but I don't think he has ever planned to give up maintainership
just because this is 2.5.
There's no denying that Anton's been doing lots of work keeping 2.5
ppc64 up-to-date but that doesn't automatically mean maintainership
should swap.
