Greetigs,
seems that in a 2.4.25 kernel, with VLAN configured, if you try tu use CBQ disc on VLAN subIf no more traffic can be passed. (NO ARP, NO IP)
Just after: 
/sbin/tc qdisc add dev eth1.10 root handle 1 cbq bandwidth 100Mbit avpkt 1000 cell 8
traffic was dropped.
Seems that in the same server enviroment the CBQ disc attached to the untagged interface can work without problems.
Thanks in advance for your help.
Regards,
Gianfranco
