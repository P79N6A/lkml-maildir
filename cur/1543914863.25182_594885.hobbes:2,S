Windows 98 doesn't, it says. That doesn't say anything about what newer 
versions of Windows are doing (like Vista, which is the first to 
actually use MMCONFIG).

Check the code. We have a quirk to handle this, in 
drivers/usb/host/pci-quirks.c

And yet, something was clearly happening to cause this. Jesse, what were 
the bridge decode windows (shown in lspci -v) on one of those boards 
that was having issues?

It's not broken at all, it just requires that we not do silly things 
like stick enabled decode regions over top of the aperture.
