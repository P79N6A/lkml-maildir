Subject: IPv6 problems with multiple interfaces

I am running kernel 2.4.3 and I have run into problems
with IPv6 when I want to use more than one network interface
card simultaneously. IPv6 works fine with one interface
but when I add another, it starts dropping packets on
the first interface. This seems to be related with
incoming Router Advertisement messages on the other
interface. About 50% of the packets in ping6 start to
get dropped after I put the other interface up.
I have added myself a small patch in ndisc.c so that
there is only one default route in the routing table
at any time. Without that things work even worse.
I have not figured out what makes IPv6 drop packets.
I would really appreciate if someone who knows
Linux IPv6 code would contact me.
Please CC to my e-mail address, as I do not
subscribe to linux-kernel.
