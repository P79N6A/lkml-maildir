Oh, that would be possible: If they have a PLL which can run at say
15/16 , they can add 16/15 to the TSC every clock.

(*) they site 90% of top speed as requiring 90% core voltage, thus
only 71% of the power. So, something close to that resolution must be
possible. 
P.S. Does everybody realize that the "cool stuff" in Linus' interview
interviewer: What do you make at Transmeta?
Linus:       Stuff. 
interviewer: What kind of stuff?
Linus:       Cool stuff. 
was a clever pun that nobody "got" for half a year or longer?
