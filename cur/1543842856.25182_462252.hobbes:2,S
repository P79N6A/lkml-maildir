    So, this seems to have a long history... :-)
    I've also heard several years ago of the drives not getting anything over 
128 sectors right, but those should be really brain-damaged...

    Wouldn't work, I'm afraid. That IBM drive is UltraATA/33, so no less than 
ATA-4...
    Well, after having referred to the ID data read from it, it's ATA-3 actually.
