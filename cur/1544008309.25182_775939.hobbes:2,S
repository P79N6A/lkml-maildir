Hi,
ftrace only stops the CPUs on start up or shutdown of the function
tracer (i.e. echo function > /debugfs/tracing/current_tracer).  It does
not stop the CPUs at any other time.
Now what ftrace does do, is to call a tracing function at pretty much
every function call in the kernel. In most places this is fine, but
there are some cases that this can be an issue. For example, we can not
trace suspend and resume because on resume smp_processor_id() is
undefined, which ftrace uses.
The following must be available without recursion for the function
tracer to work:
  local_irq_save/restore
  smp_processor_id
  preempt_enable/disable_notrace
  atomic_inc/dec
There could be other things that might be causing the crash. Do you have
a crash dump and config available?
Thanks,
