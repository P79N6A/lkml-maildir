I always thought that was just because strace didn't understand about
vfork(). 
On the other hand, maybe it's a generic problem with strace - if it gets
the child PID from the return value of "fork()", and attaches to it that
way, that has two problems:
 - it won't work reliably even under normal fork(), as it's timing-
   dependent, and by the time strace has attached to the child the child
   might have already done several system calls.
 - it would fail completely with vfork(), as vfork() only returns after
   the child has execve'd
Who's maintaining strace these days?
