Hi...
I am trying to build sensors 2.8.3 and it fails with:
make: *** No rule to make target `mach_mpspec.h', needed by `kernel/chips/vt1211.d'.  Stop.
There is no mach_mpspec.h in include/linux nor include/linux/asm in the kernel
tree (I use 2.6.2-rc1-mm3). It is not included directly by sensors, but for
example, mpspec.h reads:
werewolf:/usr/src/linux/include/asm# grep mach_mpspec.h *
mpspec.h:#include <mach_mpspec.h>
all mach_mpspec.h are inside subarch dirs in include/asm (for example, 
include/asm/mach-default/). 
Workaround is to add -I/usr/src/linux/include/asm/mach-default.
But should not the contents be symlinked for the proper subarch ? IE
/usr/src/linux/include/asm/mach_mpspec.h -> mach-default/mach_mpspec.h
TIA
