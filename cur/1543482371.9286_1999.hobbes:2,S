Hello,
  if you are using dosemu with direct access to video ports, you must
set matroxfb into compatible mode by using "fbset -depth 0".
  But if you, on other side, switch dosemu into terminal compatible mode
(v3 config options `$_video = "vga", $_console = (0), $_graphics = (0)' or
v2 option `video { vga }' ), you can use big graphics screen, for example
128x60 chars. But do not forget, that there are poor written DOS apps which
works only on 80 chars width screen (for example Volkov Commander).
                                                 Best regards,
                                                        Petr Vandrovec
                                                        vandrove@vc.cvut.cz
P.S.: Tested with MSDOS 6.22 and DOS-C 0.92, dosemu-0.66.?
