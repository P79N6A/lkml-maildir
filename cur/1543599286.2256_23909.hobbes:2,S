Thats the problem i can reproduce here (ASUS-P2B-DS with Dual PIII/850,
USB and AHA2940U2W-SCSI onboard, Kernel 2.4.2/3-SMP), SMP-Kernels with
option "nosmp" simply stop when they try to access the SCSI-System, the
aic7xxx-driver loads (no matter if build-in or module), but stucks at
initializing the first device.
No Ooop or crash, it simply does nothing any more.
But a "real" UP-Kernel (i used the one from RH7.1, 2.4.2-UP) has no
problems with booting here.
Solong..
Frank.
