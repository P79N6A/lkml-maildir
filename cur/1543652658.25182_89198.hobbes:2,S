Not so nice. /me e.g. is used to distclean, never used mrproper and 
distclean is a standard target in most projects, so people are probably 
more used to distclean than mrproper which is kernel specific.
The thing to point this out is that if the help is removed the target 
will presumably be removed sooner or later, too.
