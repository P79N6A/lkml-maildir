It's actually where the *implementation* is *declared*.  The
API is defined primarily in Documentation/gpio.txt ... though
in this case the implementation mostly punts to gpiolib.  And
as you note below, the implementation is *defined* elsewhere.

Those functions just punt to gpiolib, unlesss they happen
to fit in the "constant parameters" case where they can
expend to two or three instructions inline, rather than a
more expensive function call.
In this case, I don't see any benefit to supporting that
"inline constant parameters" case.

This is where the PXA implementation is *defined*, yes.

More or less, yes.  I'd have to see actual code.  :)

Provide a patch/RFD with
 (0) methods you want to add to "struct gpio_chip".
Nothing else.  That should be the easiest part of this change.
Other patches should probably include:
 (1) one with the proposed driver level interface ... needs
     discussion, so beginning with a patch may not be best;
 (2) one *implementing* that interface using current calls;
 (3) another *optimizing* that interface to use the new low
     level methods (0), on chips where they're available;
 (4) gpio_chip implementations for those low level ops.
Plus at least one example of how to use the interfaces in (1),
by the time everything starts to become solid, and implementation
patches are worth while.
(I'm not keen on starting with code to implement interfaces, except
when the interfaces are trivial or obvious.  Interfaces are hard to
change.  It's best to spend some time up-front improving them, while
they're easy to change/fix.)

To repeat:  what you've sent so far is mixing layers.  It doesn't split
out the programming interface from its implementation at all.
Yet the whole *point* of having gpiolib is to make that split easy.
Which is why I want to see patches that reflect that architectural
split, instead of a hard-to-review megapatch that crosses all the
existing boundaries and doesn't show how non-PXA hardware could
implement these patches (or benefit from them).
