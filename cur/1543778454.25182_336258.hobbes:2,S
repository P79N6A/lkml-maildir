Somehow I didn't ask that right... The stuff on selective disable is 
interesting, but my question is why a USB device, call it a keyboard, 
would do DMA unless I press a key, at which point response will be 
better if the CPU wakes up out of C3.
I understand that specialty attachments may send what amounts to keep 
alives, or gather data (webcam) you don't want, but the typical mouse 
and KB would seem to be things which generate DMA at user initiation, 
and would not be blocked for low power, only for suspend.
