No, but you can do init=/bin/bash. [Are you reading my mails at all?!]
And init=/bin/bash is enough to recover broken system.
What you are proposing is incompatible update that would break 99% of
all systems, for gain of 8K of unswappable memory or something like
that. That's no-no in 2.6 series, and probably bad idea for 2.7, too.
Now, can we end the thread here? Userland keyboard driver is not going
to happen in 2.6.X.
