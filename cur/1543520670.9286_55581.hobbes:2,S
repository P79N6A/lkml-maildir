BUT your executable must be started by root or be SUID. And
adapted/modified for Linux. This would mean that all deamons must do this,
and that a "humble administrator" must check the source of all of them to
see if this is correct. If the admin can see it in his filesystem, it
would be a lot easier, and more important: transparent! (This is one of
the reasons NT is often configured insecurely: You don't have an overview
of the situation)
