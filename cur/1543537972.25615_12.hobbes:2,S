You make a good point.
It looks like the REAL problem is that relatively simple kernel
programming constructs can take a tremendous amount of elapsed time
because of the amount of data or number of control blocks or size of
video screen or whatever. That long elapsed time (100ms, 4000ms or
whatever) causes other processes which can't afford long latencies to
fail. One simple response is to reprogram the logic to be more
efficient and thus quicker. But that is not always possible. X number
of bytes squeezing into the ISA bus takes Y amount of time.
I think this is the more general problem that needs some study.
One system I work with has the concept of processing queues. When a
particular type of work is needed, the process is queued be processed.
For this application, you would take an expected long process and
create an interruptible process queue to manage the work. You would
need to be careful about locks, of course.
