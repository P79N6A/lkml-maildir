the point is not the number of people who needs this, the point is that
any distributor will be forced to turn it on, since the distributor
must allow any user to do HPC or database applications. Shipping with
hugetlbfs=n is like shipping with device-mapper=n or sysfs=n or whatever
like that. And having different alloc_pages API depending on a hugetlbfs
compile option was totally broken, plus hugetlbfs=n was buggy, this is
all fixed now.
If we want to make the API not generate compound pages unless you call
with __GFP_COMP that's fine with me, that'll optimize the whole kernel,
and that's a very simple variation of my code. Still the alloc_pages API
must be indipendent of a hugetlbfs compile option.
