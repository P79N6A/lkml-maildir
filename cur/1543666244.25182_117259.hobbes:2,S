Greetings,
Nice test case.  I don't have sound capability on my linux box, but your 
test case makes it fail the window wiggle test horribly.  I fiddled with it 
a bit, and convinced it to "stop doing that please".  Does the attached 
(experimental butchery) help your box's sp-sp-speach im-p-p-pediment?
