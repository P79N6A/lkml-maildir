 just forget it. Bad day probably. SuSe 7.1 installed a pretty old
version of the tools that were not called "reiserfsprogs". And
apparently I did not see that version string....
<-----------MKREISERFS, 2000----------->
ReiserFS version 3.5.29
 Still, there should be a more convenient way to extract the version :-)
