IT8211 and IT8212 are the same , if you use it as a normal IDE device.
But IT8212 has a hardware raid fuction.
The first IT8211's product ID ,maybe also use IT8212's product ID.
I think it's ok to use the IT8212 driver.

Reading the datasheet I believe they are except that for IT8211 we
should not be checking for smart mode perhaps ?
