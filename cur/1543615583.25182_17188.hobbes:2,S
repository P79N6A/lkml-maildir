Hello,
I am hoping someone here can point me towards the right documentation / web 
page.
I want to find out what happens to kernel messages in /proc/kmsg if they are 
not read.
Specifically, 
Are they cleared after a specified amount of time (eg every 24 hours) ?
Are they cleared when they occupy a maximum size ?
If they are not read will the memory they occupy grow indefinately ?
