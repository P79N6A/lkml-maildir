It might.
I'd suspect that there can, in fact, be something done about this, 
assuming good RAM. After all, a corrupt image won't crash a decent web 
browser.
It might sacrifice a ton of performance, though. I suggest it shouldn't 
be a priority to try to figure this out, and if it's ever implemented, 
make it a mount option -- -o paranoid or something. Obviously we don't 
care if a rescue disc takes forever, but we don't want to be waiting for 
hours on our FS boot, which is why I have an initrd mount my Reiser4 FS 
with "-o dont_load_bitmap"
(Yes, I realize the right way to do this is initramfs now. I'm too lazy 
to figure out how to make that work.)
