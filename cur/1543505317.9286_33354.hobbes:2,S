Hi,
I made a small patch to allow the input of a c-cedilla (for french) with 'c.
This is the way it is handled on the X terminals.
I left the old ,c there, though I don't know how sb. would produce a dead
comma (maybe on french keyboards, it's possible ...).
Please apply. Or tell me of a better solution.
