Ok. Learning from makefiles: bzImage's copressed part is made
by gzipping toplevel 'vmlinux' processed via objcopy.
If anybody feel so inclined, I suggest doing
#objdump -O binary -R .note -R .comment -S   vmlinux vmlinux.stripped
(that's what make bzImage does, feeding result to gzip)
and inspecting 'vmlinux.stripped' for large zeroed areas
and big/strange regular patterns. That might be oversized tables.
I'd like to be enlightened how I can translate offsets in
'vmlinux.stripped' to corresponding kernel func/var...
