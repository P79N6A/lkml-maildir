In vanilla 2.2.13 I have started getting odd delays in the network traffic.  Pinging the box
will often give times of >500ms.  There is no load on the box to speak of (no swap used, load av. 0.0)
so I would expect response to be quite fast.  
2.2.13, Celeron 400, 128MB, 3*3c905B.
I have just upgraded to 2.2.14pre8 to see if that fixes it.
