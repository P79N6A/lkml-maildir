Mike, multiple parsing through the problem definition, still did not
make the problem clear. What problem is autofs trying to solve using
namespaces?
My guess is you dont want to see a automount taking place in namespaceA,
when a automount takes place in namespaceB, even though
the automount-point is in a shared subtree?
Sorry don't understand automount's requirement in the first place,
