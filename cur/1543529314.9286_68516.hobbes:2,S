I'm not sure it is worth doing either.  If it is done, it should
probably a different fs that uses the same shared memory primitives as
shmfs -- so you don't have to include the directory etc. code when
you're only interested in shm.
The most important thing to come from this work is surely the cleanup of
shared memory in general.
