Most likely some driver is disabling interrupts for that period, which 
is really longer than it should be. However, if your card/driver require 
such tight interrupt latency to function correctly, that seems too 
fragile and may not be reliable. Some kind of ringbuffer arrangement 
would likely work better, so that the interrupt does not have to be 
serviced so soon.
