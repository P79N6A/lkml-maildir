Hi there!
Your commit b60ba8343b78b182c03cf239d4342785376c1ad1 has been causing me
a bit of confusion and I thought I'd point out the problem so that you
can resolve it. :)
resource_size_t is not guaranteed to be a long long, but might be a u64
or u32 depending on your .config. So you need an explicit cast in the
printk:s or you get a lot of junk on the output.
There might be other commits with the same issue. I just noticed this one.
Rgds
Pierre
