I mean probability of gettng your data back after a disk loses data. And
the technical basis for my claims is twofold - painful experience is
one, and shooting random blocks of zeros onto a disk and run fsck tools
is another.

Well reiserfs4 is a lot more than metafiles and new vfs layer concepts.
Clearly those parts of the the fs that don't require core fs changes
belong in the kernel as soon as everyone is happy they are clean enough
and look correct.
Metafiles and openat() are an argument we can all have later.
