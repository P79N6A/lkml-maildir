I think mmiowb() should work on SN hardware. mmiowb() delays until shub
reports that all previously issued PIO writes have completed. 
The processor "mf.a" guarantees "platform acceptance" which on SN means
that shub has accepted the write - not that it has actually completed (or
even forwarded anywhere by shub). That makes "mf.a" more-or-less useless
on SN. However, shub has an additional MMR register (PIO_WRITE_COUNT) that
counts actual outstanding PIOs.  mmiob() delays until that count goes to
zero.
I'll check if there is any additional reordering that can occur AFTER the
PIO_WRITE_COUNT goes to zero.  If so, it would be at bus level - not in
shub or routers.
