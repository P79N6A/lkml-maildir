No, I hadn't consider using the percpu_counters infrastructure. But today when 
I tried using it, I got an early exception.I guess its because I tried 
calling percpu_counter_init from within sched_init, which I perhaps shouldn't 
do, because percpu_counter_init expects cpu hotplug code to be initialized by 
then. Right ? Correct me if I'm wrong.
How about we start collecting statistics at a later stage i.e, after 
percpu_counter becomes usable ?
