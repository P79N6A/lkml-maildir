 People around util-linux-ng are not so naive ;-)
 We spent last month with discussion about a way how (non-)fork this
 project. We made decision that a fork is the right way, because
 Adrian Bunk completely ignores __everyone__ who wants to talk with
 him about utils-linux.
 A fork is nothing attractive, but it's also a way how improve things
 in Open Source world.
 The goal is not only improve source code, but also a way how this
 project is maintained (mailing list, discussion about changes, git,
 transparent development, ...).
