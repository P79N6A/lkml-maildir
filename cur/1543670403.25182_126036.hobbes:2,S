Subject: unloading bridge fails [2.5.67]

Hello!
Using plain 2.5.67:
flapp:~ # brctl addbr br0
flapp:~ # brctl addif br0 eth0
flapp:~ # ifconfig br0 23.23.23.23 up
flapp:~ # brctl delif br0 eth0
flapp:~ # ifconfig br0 down
until here it works fine, but now
flapp:~ # brctl delbr br0
simply hangs. 
flapp:~ # killall -9 brctl
does not kill it.
After some Minutes the keyboard stops working, only the mouse (ps2)
keeps on working. Later the screen gets shifted left or right.
SysRq like all other keyboard actions do not work.
flapp:~ # dmesg 
[...]
device eth0 left promiscuous mode
unregister_netdevice: waiting for br0 to become free. Usage count = 2
unregister_netdevice: waiting for br0 to become free. Usage count = 2
unregister_netdevice: waiting for br0 to become free. Usage count = 2
unregister_netdevice: waiting for br0 to become free. Usage count = 2
unregister_netdevice: waiting for br0 to become free. Usage count = 2
[...repeated many times...]
This does not happen, when I don't activate the bridge (i don't issue
ifconfig br0 up).
Anyone know why ? HowTo solve ?
Nico
