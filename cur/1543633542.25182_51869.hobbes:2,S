A 16 bit register.. 64KB packets.  There are various issues with using
large packet sizes.  There is no driver that has been verified with
jumbo frames.  I have been throwing driver versions at Rishi Srivatsavai
<rishis at CLEMSON.EDU> trying to sort out the issues.  You might notice
the changes in 0.99W, although they don't handle the FIFO limit issues.

More precisely, FDDI frame size minus the FDDI-specific bits, about
4.5KB.
