The code in Linus's tree is dead and is unused.

Yes.  It's cleaner to remove all the dead stuff and to then reintroduce the
new feature as a clean, standalone thing.  So we can see its effects ore
clearly.
Also, what happens if for some reason we later want to revert your patch? 
Such a reversion would reintroduce all the old dead stuff!
Patches should each do a single thing.

There's plenty of time to get this into 2.6.16.
Your changelog didn't describe this as a "severe" problem.  Things have
been like this for quite some time, haven't they?
And we shouldn't be merging new, untested things ahead of work which has
had considerable amounts of testing.
