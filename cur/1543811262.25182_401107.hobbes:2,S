 Hi David,
 As you've asked, I'm sending again my patches for pktgen:
[PATCH 1/6] pktgen: Lindent run.
[PATCH 2/6] pktgen: Ports thread list to Kernel list implementation.
[PATCH 3/6] pktgen: Fix kernel_thread() fail leak.
[PATCH 4/6] pktgen: Fix Initialization fail leak.
[PATCH 5/6] pktgen: Ports if_list to the in-kernel implementation.
[PATCH 6/6] pktgen: Updates version.
 The changes from V2 are:
 1. Generated all the patches again agaisnt current net-2.6.17 tree
 2. Added the if_list port patch to the series, because it was sent
 separately last time
 3. Added a patch to updates pktgen's version (forgot this one first
 time).
 As I did before, all the patches were tested with QEMU emulating a four
CPU machine with four NICS.
 Also note that Robert have already acked patches 1 to 4.
 Thanks,
