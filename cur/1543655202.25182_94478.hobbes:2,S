Not with data journaling.  That's the whole point: the VFS assumes too
much about where the data is being written, when.

But it's data that is the problem.  For sync() semantics,
data-journaling only requires that the pages have hit the journal.  For
umount, it is critical that we complete the final writeback before
destroying the inode lists.
