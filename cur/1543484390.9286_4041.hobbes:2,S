Derek's got a worse problem than you do, since he has to deal with the
kernel module interface.  As do I, being that I have to support his work
in a production environment; if he has problems delivering because the
kernel module interface broke *again*, I can't deploy no matter how many
people need the new kernel.  ---And it probably does affect you, to the
extent that if linux-afs doesn't work on a new kernel you can't deploy
it either.  Yes, there's Arla, but having to rebuild it for each new minor
kernel rev that comes down the pike is only slightly better --- and not
even that if it's on a system that has key parts of its userspace on AFS
("the kerberos includes and libs aren't important enough to force them to
be local", aargh!  I'm still putting 2.[12].x Arla machines back together...).
By and large the system call interface has been reasonably well behaved, with
notable exceptions in the area of ioctls --- and some syscalls, e.g. it
seems a change to initgroups in 2.2 broke Arla's PAGs.  The module interface
is a serious problem, however, and the two extant workarounds (Arla's source
availability and Coda being included in the standard kernel) each have their
own attendant problems.

     We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
