When I first installed RH 7.1 on my Tyan K7, the system would lock upon boot when the USB module was loaded. I disabled the USB controller in the BIOS and all
was fine. After compiling 2.4.7-ac10 and running it for some time reliably, I re-enabled USB and re-compiled making sure the USB modules were included. They now
load just fine.
Note that I do not (yet) have any USB devices.
