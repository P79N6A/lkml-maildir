Is this chip an example of that?  It's I2C-only, and a quick
scan of TI's touchscreen chip page didn't show a sibling chip
with a logically-identical interface using SPI.

I'll disagree.  When it's needed, this is easy to do ... bus
glue talking to chip-specific code, and including some kind of
bus-specific register access wrapper.  No framework necessary,
just straightforward design for any such drivers.
