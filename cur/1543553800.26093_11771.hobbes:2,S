Umm, so why does this not happen with 2.2.X at all? Also the system is
not really stressed, but I simply do startx, inside an xterm go to
some random source, make -j, wait till the compile is complete and then
switch back to the console - its just that it seems that swapped out
X server or console stuff causes this.
I consider this quite a showstopper for 2.4.0.
