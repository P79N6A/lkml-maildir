Well, long story short,
s2ram was not working a few weeks
ago, as well as echo mem > sys/power/state also.
Now this morning I built the package s2ram
from the debian sid repository(even though I'm using jaunty), and viola
it works again(last week s2ram was leaving a blank screen for
some reason or another.)
The only issue for now at least is
echo mem > /sys/power/state
which results in a blank screen,
and an instant reboot.
aside note don't mean to confuse you.
