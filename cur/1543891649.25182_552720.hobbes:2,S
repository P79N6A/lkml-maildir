Yeah, I see that you aren't necessarily asking for valid memory, just
something that appears valid.  I'm still of the mind that if code is
asking for a zero-length allocation, it's raising a flag that it's not
taking some corner case into account.  But I think I'm just
regurgitating what Christoph is arguing.

Oh.  I went back and re-read the thread and it looks like you proposed
this already.  I don't see where Christoph did, or agreed, but maybe I
missed something.

If the caller is asking for 0 bytes, it shouldn't be doing anything with
the returned address except checking for a NULL return.  But then, it's
hard to predict everything that calling code might be doing, such as
allocating buffers and creating a hash based on their addresses.  Of
course, if there's code that would have a problem with it, I think it's
a further argument that it would be better off avoiding the calling
kmalloc(0) in the first place.
