I think what the "Bzzert" is implying is that once you license your code 
under the GPL v2 for the kernel use, it's then licensed that way for 
distribution.  You can't prohibit people from using it in other contexts 
with that license or it violates the GPL v2 license and then can't be 
distributed with the kernel, either. If I'm reading that correctly.
To cross license you'd have to allow either license for any use, really, 
as long as the use complies with the license.  Adding 'if the code is 
used outside of the kernel, it would "fall back to" v3+' would violate 
the GPL v2.
