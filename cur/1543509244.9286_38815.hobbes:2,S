Hi everyone,
I just got a Yamaha CRW4416S, firmware revision 1.0g, and put it on my
linux box - the SCSI controller is an Adaptec 2940.  Anyway, the drive
seems to work beautifully, except that it has a problem when using the
cdplay program from RH6.0.
Invoking the CD player always seems to lock the SCSI bus.  I have
consistently seen loops of:  
Domain Validation Successful
Performing Domain Validation
I've also sometimes seen messages that say that the card is
renegotiating at a lower speed due to Domain Validation failures.
I rebooted into 2.2.13pre7 with init=/bin/sh, and used the debug=1
option to the Uniform CD-Rom driver and got the list of messages below.
Is this a problem with the drive's firmware, the linux drivers, or the
SCSI controller?  The drive seems to play audio fine in win95, and can
read data CD's, and can use cdda2wav to rip audio tracks from the CD.
I don't get linux-kernel directly, so I'd appreciate it if replies were
also CC'ed to gazornetzer@students.wisc.edu
Thanks very much,
-Greg Zornetzer
