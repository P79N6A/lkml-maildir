No, the breakage is probably mine. 
The problem was that you sent me the forward-port of Alan's backport of
basically this driver, and then sent me updates on top of that. When I got
the original thing, I decided that it was better to start off from that,
just in case. And I probably broke stuff when I did the very nasty merge,
which was definitely not incremental..
