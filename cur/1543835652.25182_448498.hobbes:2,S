Regarding Bottom half scheduling in a typical scenario.
Suppose a tasklet(bottom half) process is running and an Interrupt
occured and pre-empted the tasklet. The interrupt scheduled another
tasklet of different type.
The question is: Which tasklet will come into execution when the
interrupt task completes?. In other words whether the pre-empted
tasklet will resume its exec-
ution or the newly scheduled tasklet will execute?
