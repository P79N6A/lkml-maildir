1. It is a stick with two ends. You become slow lame and lazy and forget to
update (under the idea: whatever, nobody can exploit it anyway). 
Have a look at DGUX. It used to have a non-exec stack in the 3.x days. As a
result most of the exploits (even elementary ones like lpd were not fixed). Then
in 4.x the stack had to go executable again. And then it became fun (actually I
am slightly incorrect here because the fun officially began after some kid
posted general purpose shellcode for alpha).
2. Trampolines:
        A: the few programs are f.e. glibc itself or docs on solar
designer patches are wrong.
        B: solar designer patches have been doing this for quite a while.
3. If at least solar designer's and andrew tridgel's patches (pipes in
proc, etc) will finally make it into the mainstream kernel it will be very very
nice.
