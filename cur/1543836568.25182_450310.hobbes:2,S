so if I understand this correctly we are saying that a kernel compiled to run on 
hypervisor A would need to be recompiled to run on hypervisor B, and recompiled 
again to run on hypervisor C, etc
where A could be bare hardware, B could be Xen 2, C could be Xen 3, D could be 
vmware, E could be vanilla Linux, etc.
this sounds like something that the distros would not support, they would pick 
their one hypervisor to support and leave out the others. the big problem with 
this is that the preferred hypervisor will change over time and people will be 
left with incompatable choices (or having to compile their own kernels, 
including having to recompile older kernels to support newer hypervisors)
