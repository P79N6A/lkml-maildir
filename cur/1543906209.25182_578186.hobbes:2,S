Alright not the greatest of examples, there is something to be said about
symmetry, so...let me try again :)
/a/
/b/bar		(whiteout for bar)
/c/foo/qwerty
Now, let's mount a union of {a,b,c}, and we'll see:
$ find /u
/u
/u/foo
/u/foo/qwerty
$ mv /u/foo /u/bar
Now what? How do you rename? Do you rename in the same branch (assuming it
is rw)? If you do, you'll get:
$ find /u
/u
Oops! There's a whiteout in /b that hides the directory in /c -- rename(2)
shouldn't make directory subtrees disappear.
There are two ways to solve this:
1) "cp -r" the entire subtree being renamed to highest-priority branch, and
rename there (you might have to recreate a series of directories to have a
place to "cp" to...so you got "cp -r" _AND_ "mkdir -p"-like code in the VFS!
1/2 a :) )
2) Don't store whiteouts within branches. This makes it really easy to
rename and remove the whiteout.
Sure, you could try to rename in-place and remove the whiteout, but what if
you have:
/a/
/b/bar		(whiteout)
/c/bar/blah
/d/foo/qwerty
$ mv /u/foo /u/bar
You can't just remove the whiteout, because that'd uncover the whited-out
directory bar in /c.
