 Intel documents it to be APIC disable bit -- once disabled this way, APIC
is claimed to be enabled only by a subsequent RESET (not even INIT).  If
it works for you, then it definitely is nice.  I don't have a P6 machine
nearby so I cannot actually test it.  I wonder whether it works for the
original PPro, too.
