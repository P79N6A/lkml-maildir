Uhh?
dev_t name_to_dev_t(char *name)
{
        dev_t res = 0;
        sys_mkdir("/sys", 0700);
        if (sys_mount("sysfs", "/sys", "sysfs", 0, NULL) < 0)
                goto out;
	...
out:
        sys_rmdir("/sys");
        return res;
}
If sysfs can't be mounted, then it looks like we can't even decode a
numeric major:minor root device specification.
