How do you define "proven in court"?
Decided by an US judge based on US laws?
Decided by a German judge based on German laws?

If you distribute software you can be sued in every country you

E.g. Harald Welte is currently quite successful with legal actions in

without offering the source of the GPL'ed software they use.
