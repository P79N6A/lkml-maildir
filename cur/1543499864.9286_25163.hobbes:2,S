Blocking in cleanup_module is okay; it's run in the context of whatever
process is calling the delete_module system call (eg. rmmod).  The real
problem is being sure that cleanup_module does not return until the thread
associated with that module is truly gone.  waitpid should really be the
right solution (opposed to the semaphore method I suggested, which was
really not very good), but I'm not sure why it wasn't consistently working.
