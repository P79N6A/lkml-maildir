Yeah, smart thing :)  Thank you for the response!  When I have
downgraded the server to 2.6.17, none of those errors happened again.
(And I left the setup that way, because some programs have been
corrupting their config files because of the spurious read errors --
most notably zsh and firefox.)

As far as I can see, that patch is from May 21st, and went in 17-rc5,
thus obviously 2.6.17 is newer than that...  But a bunch of nfs changes
happened in 18-rc1.

Well, I tried that, but I couldn't see errors flying on the wire.  That
would point to flaws in the 18-rc1 client (but only surfacing with an
rc1 server?), or in my eyes :)

Thanks, that's probably what I've been looking for.  I'll try to debug
this with a 2.6.18-rc2(client):2.6.17(server) and 2.6.18-rc2(both) setup
later this day, but those machines are currently in the process of
reorganizing their RAID config :)
