 Ok, but, hmm.. I found the spinklock is actually used by other drivers too.
 I didn't catch this before because I wasn't compiling then. Sorry, my fault.

| 
| - Add semaphore to serialize close()/open() (properly documented)
| - Replace write_urb_busy with an atomic_t
| - Remove the spinlock
 Since the spinlock seems to be only used to protect 'write_urb_busy', I agree
with those changes.
 Greg, do you? If so, I suggested we should add the semaphore first, because
it is a bug fix.
 I can do the 'write_urb_busy' type replace next week (yes, I will replace all
the drivers).
