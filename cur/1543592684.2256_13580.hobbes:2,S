I don't think it is a cabling problem, I think it is that motherboard.  I
suspect that the chipset on that motherboard is not well supported by
Linux.  
As an aside, I am less than impressed with the IDE support in Linux.
It's been a constant source of problems for the last couple of years
and it doesn't seem to get fixed.  We seem to get lots of chip sets 
almost working and then move on to the next one.
