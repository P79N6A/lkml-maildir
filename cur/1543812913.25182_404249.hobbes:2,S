I don't think so.. if you build a device that connects to the PCI bus it 
had better come up in a stable state if it wants to be compliant with 
the spec. That's what the reset line and power-up reset interval is for.

You still aren't seeing my point. Why does enabling the device BARs 
cause the device to generate interrupts? And if there's something you 
need to do to prevent the device from generating interrupts, how can you 
do it without enabling the device?
Also, the device's ISR must clear the condition which is causing the 
interrupt, otherwise interrupt storms will result. If your device can 
enter a state where the interrupt cannot be reliably cleared, how can 
you possibly comply with this?

I don't think any workarounds are needed except for devices that don't 
comply with the spec. Asserting interrupts that have not been 
specifically enabled by the driver would meet that definition in my 
view. If a device happens to do this then maybe a workaround would be 
needed, but that's what it would be, a workaround for a broken device.
