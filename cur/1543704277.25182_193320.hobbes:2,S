Not by much.

And in just about any circumstance, with the _possible_ exception of 
module unload, things like this can be fooled into deadlocking by a 
non-root user.
To the point where root can no longer fix things up.
We've had these bugs before. It's a mistake to make interfaces that 
positively _encourage_ bugs like this.
The canonical example of a bug like this is when a regular user can 
trigger an event that causes the wait, and then makes sure that it holds a 
reference count on the event - by opening a file descriptor.

Not likely. The rest of the kernel never does it.
What is it with USB that makes people think so? Remember all the USB bugs 
early on that were due to _exactly_ that thinking. 
It's wrong. YOU SHOULD NEVER WAIT FOR THE REFERNCE COUNT TO DROP TO ZERO!
You just ignore it. With proper memory management it doesn't matter.
For module unload, it's likely better to return an error than to wait. 
Tell the super-user that you're busy.

Quite probably.
