Disks have OOB areas with ECC, it's just nicely hidden inside the
drive. They also typically have physical sectors bigger than 512
bytes, again hidden.

It seems to be about spanning devices and repartitioning as well.
Hence the analogy with LVM.

Note the scare quotes. Device mapper runs on top of a block device.
And mtdblock is currently the block interface that MTD exports. And it
has 'smarts' that hide handling of sub-eraseblock I/O. I'm clearly
talking about an approach that doesn't involve UBI at all.

And? You can't do I/O smaller than a sector on a disk.
