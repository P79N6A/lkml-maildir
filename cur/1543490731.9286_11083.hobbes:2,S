OK.  So you know, a bugfix/new-SG-capable release (9.5) is coming out
later today.  Among the fixes is backing this patch off a bit so that
drives like older NECs and the Yamaha burners can get to track 1
again.
(Cdparanoia reads early in case there's a defect right at the
beginning of thre track and it needs preceeding data to
interpolate... not that the interpolation is implemented yet.  The
pregap patch changed the logical start of disc to lba 0 which means
accessing track 1 suddenly required a drive to be able to access the
pregap, which a scattered number of models cannot.  9.5 simply
eliminates the 'read-early' behavior until 10 can do it right).
