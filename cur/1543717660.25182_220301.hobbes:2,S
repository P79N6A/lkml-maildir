That works good now, see my recent posting to the thread on the cpufreq list
for more details. I had ACPI processor as module, and that made the
powernow-k8 ACPI detection to fail. I fixed it with the following little
patch, attaching it here too for reference.

Works now, from cpufreq point of view. As of 2.6.6 the ACPI processor 
module hangs the system if compiled in. Loading it as module after init 
does not hang.
