"Linux VM works wonderfully when nobody is using it" 
Which is rather like the scheduler works well for one task then by three is
making bad decisions.

The last decent Linx VM behaviour was about 2.1.100 or so - which was
without reverse maps. It's been downhill since then. So yes you may be
right.

Much of this goes away if you get rid of both the swap and anonymous page
special cases. Back anonymous pages with the "whoops everything I write here
vanishes mysteriously" file system and swap with a swapfs
Reverse mappings make linear aging easier to do but are not critical (we
can walk all physical pages via the page map array).
