Ok, I can't, for the life of me, get sound to work on my SE440BX-2
motherboard... it has some weird Yamaha sound card chipset built-in... the
PCI device isnt' even recognized:
  Bus  0, device  12, function  0:
    Multimedia audio controller: Unknown vendor Unknown device (rev 4).
      Vendor id=1073. Device id=a.
      Medium devsel.  IRQ 5.  Master Capable.  Latency=64.  Min Gnt=5.Max Lat=25.
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xf4000000 [0xf4000000].
I've tried various sound drivers, all to no avail... it works fine under
windows, since there are drivers on the motherboard CD...
Hmm.. the motherboard CD says it's a 'Yamaha YMF740 (DS1-L) PCI' card...
Anyone have any ideas? :-)
