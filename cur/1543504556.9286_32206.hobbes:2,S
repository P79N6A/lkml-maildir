Agreed.  You won't hear a complaint from me here... I was only pointing
out that the behavior was expected and can be accounted for, so that we
don't hear criticisms based on the bonnie figures.

Okay, yeah that makes sense, about the abundant syscalls.  Some of the
lmbench tests syscall a LOT, approaching about 50% system time for the
CPU.  I don't see that penalizing the idle task matters, though, because
when there's idle CPU time it will be run anyway, regardless of penalties.
Really, the right thing to do here seems to be ignoring the problem.  The
patch does what it's designed to do; it doesn't magically fix some
unfixable problems, but I don't think anyone expected it to do so. :)

Yeah, sorry.  UP machine, UP kernel.  Otherwise two tasks wouldn't have
made much sense. <g>
