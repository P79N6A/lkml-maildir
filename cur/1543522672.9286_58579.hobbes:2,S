Ok so the card is working fine but reports itself as an I2O device (I assume
the pci code knows about mass storage class). The cards I have hang on boot
if they are in i2o mode. 
Humm, I can see this isnt going to be as simple as I thought. Are your cards
i2o mode ? (bios settings, objects, adapter, interface (mass storage/i2o)
