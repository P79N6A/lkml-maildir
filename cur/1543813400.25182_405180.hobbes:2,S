As I known, BSD process audit only can be done inside a process, and 
audit result is just visible after
termination of this process, if an application wants to monitor all the 
processes, it has no way. My patch
 provides such a way bases on inotify with minimal work, it should be an 
good extension for
inotify although it can't cover all the cases.
