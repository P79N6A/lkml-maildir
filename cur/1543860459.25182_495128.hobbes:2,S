Hi,
Testing from Bill Kenworthy indicates that commit 
0a85b964e141a4b8db6eaf500ceace12f8f52f93 introduces a ppp-over-bluetooth 
regression.

I see this has already been reported by Johannes Hoerhan on the bluez 
list. 
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.bluez.devel/10148/focus=10232
I don't really see how this could be a udev issue, since it's obviously 
so intricately linked to that line of code.
How can we help diagnose this further - any debugging flags we should 
turn on?
Thanks,
Daniel
