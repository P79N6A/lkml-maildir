Hi!
I must say that I do not like this code. I created something similar,
ptrace-based, long time ago. It was called subterfugue.sf.net, and it
was easy-to-use; but it was also very un-unixy, slow, and gross hack.
Unfortunately AA only fixes the 'slow' part by moving it to the
kernel.

Not true, as sendmail hole showed long time ago. Error paths tend to
be untested, and AA is very capable of unmasking such bugs.

If it is not scalable to whole system, why bother?
If it is only used for small part of system, why not use subterfugue?
Recently patches were proposed to improve ptrace performance a lot...

It is part of suse linux, but I'd not call it core part.
