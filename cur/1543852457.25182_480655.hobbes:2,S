Ok, so there is some interest in having the dma_ops in struct device
beyond powerpc.
I'll put together today a patch doing:
 - add #include <asm/device.h> to linux/device.h
 - add a device.h file in asm/* that does:
	struct dev_sysdata {
	};
 - add a struct dev_sysdata sysdata; field to struct device
That patch alone is 0 overhead and allows archs to start adding things.
I'll then modify my pending patches for 2.6.20 to use that instead of my
current device_ext thing.
Is that ok with everybody for 2.6.20 ?
Then, we can do, in no special order:
  - on x86, put the acpi data in there and remove firmware_data from
struct device
  - on x86, m32, frv, put the dma_coherent_mem pointer in there too and
remove it from struct device
  - you can use it on ARM to put your dma_operations pointer as I'm
doing in for powerpc
  - x86 can do the same 
etc...
Cheers,
Ben.
