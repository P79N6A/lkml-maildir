Subject: SMP: unnecessary scheduling when using pipes [2.3.*]

short summary:
The semaphore PIPE_SEM(*inode) is only taken for very brief amounts
of time, all real waiting is done with PIPE_WAIT. On a SMP system
replacing this semaphore with a spinlock avoids unnecessary scheduling.
long story:
While experimenting with the lockmeter-patch (to measure spinlock wait
and hold times), I got the following strange results:
CON   WAIT    TOTAL  NOWAIT  SPIN
58%   1.4us   22508   9657  12851   __down_interruptible+0x390
27%   0.7us   22508  16588   5920   __down_interruptible+0xb8
there was extremely high contention on the wait_queue lock
[0x390 = remove_wait_queue, 0xb8 = add_wait_queue_exclusive]
of a semaphore, due to contention on the semaphore itself.
All these calls to __down_interruptible where due to contention
on PIPE_SEM in pipe_read and pipe_write.
As PIPE_SEM is only held for a very short time, the "semaphore-overhead"
of:
	- Adding the waiting process to a waitqueue
	- schedule
	in __down_interruptible()
	- wake up the process
	in __up()
	and finally
	- remove the process from the waitqueue
	in down__interruptible() again
seems excessive [especially if bad timing leaves you spinning when
accessing the waitqueue]
I made a small patch that adds a spinlock_t variable to pipe_inode_info
and uses this spinlock to protect write and read. In all other functions
that do a down(PIPE_SEM), this spinlock is first taken and released
after
calling up(PIPE_SEM).
Can anyone tell me whether locking PIPE_SEM (which is just inode->i_sem
in disguise) is necessary for synchronizing with other parts of the
kernel that lock i_sem ?
If someone is interested in the patch, email me.
To reproduce the problem, just run a process writing to a pipe while
another
process is reading from it.
example: pipedis from the IX_SSBA benchmark
"pipedis 500000 1" takes ~5.7sec with 2.3.46 on my dual PIII, with the
patch
it just takes ~1.9sec [2.2.14 takes ~2.1sec]
