Subject: Unable to get www.opendx.org/index.html in Linux 2.2.* (Debian 2.1)

Hello,
I think the following is a bug, but I'll let the experts figure that
out...
[1.] One line summary of the problem:
	Unable to get www.opendx.org/index.html in Linux 2.2.* (Debian 2.1)
[2.] Full description of the problem/report:
	Using either wget or netscape, I'm unable to access the URL
	www.opendx.org/index.html (or www.opendx.org). This is the only
	URL where I have noticed this problem. I get the following
	error from wget:
	dan-m> wget www.opendx.org
	--11:06:03--  
http://www.opendx.org:80/
	           => `index.html'
	Connecting to www.opendx.org:80... connected!
	HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 
	Read error (Connection reset by peer) in headers.
	Retrying.
	--11:15:06--  
http://www.opendx.org:80/
	  (try: 2) => `index.html'
	Connecting to www.opendx.org:80... connected!
	HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 
	...
	...
	Goes on and on....
	
	I have tried both on my own Linux box (kernel 2.2.3) and on one of
	my collegues' (kernel 2.2.10) with the same results. On a box running
	Linux 2.0.36, however, the problem was not present. I also didn't see
	the problem on various other Unix boxes (AIX, Solaris, IRIX), so it
	seems to be related to the networking code in the 2.2.* kernel series.
	Either that, or some distribution specific problem (both boxes where
	the problem showed up are running Debian (slink)).
[3.] Keywords (i.e., modules, networking, kernel):
	Networking, http, tcp/ip
[4.] Kernel version (from /proc/version):
	Linux version 2.2.3 (root@dan-m) (gcc version 2.7.2.3) #1 Fri Jun 4 13:01:07 CEST 1999
	Linux version 2.2.10 (root@erik-kd) (gcc version egcs-2.91.66 Debian GNU/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release)) #1 SMP Fri Jun 25 10:18:12 CEST 1999
[5.] Output of Oops.. message (if applicable) with symbolic information 
     resolved (see Documentation/oops-tracing.txt)
	 N/A
[6.] A small shell script or example program which triggers the
     problem (if possible)
	 wget www.opendx.org
[7.] Environment
	Debian 2.1 (slink)
[7.1.] Software (add the output of the ver_linux script here)
