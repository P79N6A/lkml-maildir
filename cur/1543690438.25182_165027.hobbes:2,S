Hi Ravi!
	CONFIG_KALLSYMS is probably what you want here, along with
/proc/kallsyms.  You can, also generate the equivalent of insmod -m
from the output of /proc/modules and the symbol table in the module.
BTW, I'd generally recommend modprobe over insmod: as you will have
noticed, the new insmod is designed to be a really low-level tool.
Hope this helps,
Rusty.
