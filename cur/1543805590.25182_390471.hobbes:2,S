>> Tell me how to access a ATAPI tape drive via libscg.
(I probably don't get that question.)
The top of drivers/ide/ide-tape.c shows it gets /dev/ht%d (when used 
without scsi emulation I believe). And I pick a wild guess that it gets 
/dev/sg%d when used with scsi emu.
Programs using libscg would only need to use S:I:L or ATA:/dev/ht0 (?)
I presume?

I think you (Matthias) get it slightly skewed here. As far as I am able to 
slip through the flames, libscg is used by cdrecord just as libc is used by 
all apps to have "some sort" of OS abstraction (pick some function, like 
fork()). Therefore, libscg seems +not only+ about cd writing. However, if 
you want to have a working cdrecord, you need a working libscg, just like 
you need a working libc or your system is going bye-bye.
