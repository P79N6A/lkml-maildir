Consider what happens if:
- you have 2 physical cpus, 4 logical cpus
- you have 40 running SCHED_NORMAL tasks on a well balanced system --
roughly 10 on each runqueue
- start up a spinning SCHED_FIFO task on cpu 0
Assuming that cpu 1 is the sibling of 0, cpu 1 now has 10 SCHED_NORMAL
tasks that are totally screwed -- they will never, ever, run anywhere,
period.
Now consider what happens if I start up 40 more SCHED_NORMAL tasks.  The
load-balancer will kindly place 10 of them on cpu 1's runqueue so they
too can be screwed for all eternity.  Nice.
One more thing: I *think* wake_idle() tends to wake tasks to idle cpus
regardless of the idle cpu's runqueue length.  This is why I say the
idle cpu becomes a magnet for even more tasks, until the balancer
straightens things out again.
I guess the bottom-line is: given N logical cpus, 1/N of all
SCHED_NORMAL tasks may get stuck on a sibling cpu with no chance to
run.  All it takes is one spinning SCHED_FIFO task.  Sounds like a bug.
