How?  Scenario:
   1. a thread calls a 3rd party library which was _not_ compiled with
      threading in mind.  (It shouldn't have to be).
   2. 3rd party library sends itself a SIGABRT; perhaps an assertion
      failed.  (Variants: SIGFPE, library does execve(), etc.)
   3. thread exits....   but the mutex was _not_ released
   4. I _want_ to report the death to other thread, without having
      to poll all my children in my main event loop.
This is a very legitimate and useful kind of thread death, and it's
perfectly safe too.  (Not pthreads-conformant, but clone() is useful for
more than just pthreads).
As things are at the moment, you've arranged things so that I can't use
CLONE_DETACHED if I want to catch threads which die unexpectedly.
Why can't I have both at the same time?  They are both good.
