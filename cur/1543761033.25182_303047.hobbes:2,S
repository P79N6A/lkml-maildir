Hi all,
The latest release of ocf-linux (20050315) is available for download
from the project page:
	
http://ocf-linux.sourceforge.net/
This release includes the following changes:
	* Hifn PLL bug fixes
	* Makefile fixes for 2.6 builds
	* 2.6.11 and 2.4.29 patches
	* cleanups for x86 builds
OCF-Linux is a Linux port of the OpenBSD/FreeBSD Cryptographic Framework
(OCF). This port aims to bring full asynchronous HW/SW crypto
acceleration to the Linux kernel and applications running under Linux.
Results have shown improvements of up to 7 times that of software crypto
for bulk crypto throughput using OpenSSL.
At this point in time OCF-Linux provides acceleration for OpenSSL,
OpenSSH (scp, ssh, ...) and also supports the BSD crypto testing
applications. It can accelerate DES, 3DES, AES, MD5, SHA, and Public Key
operations with plans to include Random Number generators and more. This
project is being actively developed as a high performance crypto
solution for embedded devices but also applies equally well to any linux
based server or desktop.
Cheers,
Davidm
