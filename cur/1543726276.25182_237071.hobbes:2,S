The log messages you sent didn't show a multi-tt hub ... just a
single-TT one from NEC.
One of the boot problems you had was because you didn't start
EHCI first.  That meant that when you started EHCI, it grabbed
that hub, which had already been enumerated (and the devices
on the hub) ... it's possible some of the recent changes to the
hub code made that misbehave.  Basically it's like pulling out
a hub with three devices attached, and I think I recently saw
that misbehave too.
If that's really what's up, then the workaround is to do what you
should have been doing all along:  initialize EHCI first, so it
grabs all high speed devices before the other controllers grab
on to them.
