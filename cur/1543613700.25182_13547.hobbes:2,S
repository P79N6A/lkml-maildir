See my report on what happens on a 2GB box with .16 or .17rc1. Buffers are
still not released as they should.

Perhaps someone could test on x86 with less memory (I can do that later, but
right now I don't have any throw-away box with a recent kernel on it). On ia64
with 2GB+256MB swap this results in OOM when trying to allocate and use
1.7GB, albeit the real mem usage (-buffers) is less than 200MB. 
Basically the test is
fill cache 
 find / -type f -exec cat {} \; > /dev/null
 updatedb     
then run this with suitable argument:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#define BKSP "\010\010\010\010\010\010"
int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    unsigned long megs = 512;
    unsigned long size, i;
    unsigned char* buf;
    if (argc > 1) megs = atol(argv[1]);
    size = megs * 1024 * 1024;
    
    fprintf(stderr, "Allocating %lu megs...\n\n      ", megs);
    buf = malloc(size);
    if (!buf)
    {
         fprintf(stderr, "malloc(%lu", size);
         perror(")");
         exit(-1);
    }
    
    for (i = 0; i < size; i++)
    {
         buf[i] = 42;
         
         if ((i + 1) % (1024 * 1024) == 0) 
             fprintf(stderr, BKSP "%4uMB", (i + 1) / 1024 / 1024);
    }
    
    fprintf(stderr, "\n Success.\n");
    
    return 1;
}
