The whole business of RPC upcalls to statd is a mess. It needs to
be redone in a way that allows use of file locking without having
to start portmap and statd first.
There's also some logic in the RPC layer that allows the client
to `rebind' i.e. contact the server portmapper to get the current
port number. That is used by the file locking code when it finds
it's persistently stuck retransmitting packets.
