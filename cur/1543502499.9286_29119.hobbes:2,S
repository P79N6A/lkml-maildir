  Throwing them out will be pointless, but overuse of threads is harmful.
The fact that in certain other OS nothing can be accomplished efficiently
without them is irrelevant.

  It's noticeably slower only if processes are constantly created -- but
the same applies to threads. Unix has more advanced interprocess
communication than ones in other systems precisely because it does not
rely on threaded programming.

  Where poll()/select() is applicable it's very efficient, and in most of
cases easy to use unless the concept is completely foreign to the
programmer.
