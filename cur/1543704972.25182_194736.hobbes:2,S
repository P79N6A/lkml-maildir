Indeed!  And this may make the whole idea of an open-arch GPU a pipe-dream.
Honestly, we don't _need_ an open-arch GPU.  We just need something 
whose register set is fully publically documented.
But an open-arch GPU would be NEAT, though.  :)
Hmmm... If I understand this right, one of the reasons nVidia doesn't 
release open source drivers is that they don't own all of the IP in 
their cores.  I wonder what that IP is and if the open-source community 
couldn't collaborate to produce LGPL-like replacements.
