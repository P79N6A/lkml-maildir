Hi Linus,
Please pull the 'drm-next' branch from
ssh://master.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/airlied/drm-2.6.git drm-next
This is mostly KMS related fixes, with a GEM related fix that stable also 
needs.
Dave.

    drm: fix ordering of driver unload vs agp unload.
    
    For KMS drivers, we really need to cleanup the driver before disabling
    the AGP subsystem.

    drm/i915: Add support for integrated HDMI on G4X hardware.
    
    This is ported directly from the userland 2D driver code.  The HDMI audio bits
    aren't hooked up yet.

    drm/i915: Pin cursor bo and unpin old bo when setting cursor.
    
    We also didn't track the cursor bo before and would leak a reference
    when the cursor image was change.

commit 9bb2d6f94aeb9a185d69aedbd19421b6da4e3309
Author: Eric Anholt <eric@anholt.net>

    drm/i915: Don't allow objects to get bound while VT switched.
    
    This avoids a BUG_ON in the enter_vt path due to objects being in the GTT
    when we shouldn't have ever let them be (as we're not supposed to touch the
    device during that time).
    
    This was triggered by a change in the 2D driver to use the GTT mapping of
    objects after pinning them to improve software fallback performance.
