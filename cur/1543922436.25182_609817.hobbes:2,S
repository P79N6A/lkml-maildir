Well currently sg_chain() only joins "incomplete" (ie. unterminated) sg 
chains.  That works great for you, but it feels more like a special purpose 
to me.

It was suggested by analogy earlier in this thread, to use a two-level 
structure.
In this case I would have first renamed struct scatterlist to struct 
scatterelem.  Then struct scatterlist looks like:
	struct scatterlist {
		unsigned int num;
		struct scatterelem elems[0];
	};
We'd want a nice macro to declare them for the stack case:
#define DEFINE_SCATTERLIST(name, elems)		\
	struct {				\
		struct scatterlist sg;		\
		struct scatterelem elems[num];	\
	} name
Now we've tied the number and array together, we can introduce:
struct sg_multilist
{
	unsigned int num_scatterlists;
	struct scatterlist *sg_array[0];
};
And, of course, a common way to represent a one-sglist array:
#define DEFINE_SG_MULTI(name, num)			\
	struct {					\
		struct sg_multilist ml;			\
		struct scatterlist *sg_array;		\
		struct scatterlist sg;			\
		struct scatterelem elems[num];		\
	} name = { .ml = { 1 }, .sg_array = &name.sg }
Now simply replace all the places which expect a "struct scatterlist" 
with "struct sg_multilist" and we're done.
Using dangling structures is not as neat as using pointers, but it's very 
efficient.

I changed the sg_chain() function not to take one off the argument.  It made 
more sense when I wrote the virtblk code (here it's natural, since the num 
elements used + 1 == size of array).

Agreed, and it was the use of "prv_nents - 2" in that code which made me think 
the arg should be "num used" not "one past the num used".
Cheers,
Rusty.
