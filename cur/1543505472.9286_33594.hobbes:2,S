So is this "the standard"?  It would be nice if I could make this
assumption in the future.

Ah, wouldn't it be nice...  Has anyone talked about making a concrete
decision on this issue?
I like rth's suggestion about having bus-specific ioremap() instead of a
generic one; then all readl() etc. would go through that, and do "the
right thing" for that bus.  One could add "bigendian_writel()" and
"littleendian_writel()" to satisfy the Linus constraint of making
unusual usage of writel() obvious.
