I've discovered this comment by Andre Hedrick and another by Alan Cox:

"This is what it tells you directly.  You have dirty crosstalk on your
ribbon.  Basically nothing is wrong, except you can not safely support
that transfer rate."

"BadCRC is normally a cable error, but I'm suspicious that its also one
of the things caused by PCI bus problems on the VIA stuff"
The thing is though how can it be such a short step between a few CRC
errors and the IDE bus going into Autistic mode.
