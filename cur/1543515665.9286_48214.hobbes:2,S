The result of FIBMAP can always be out of date by the time it reaches
user space.  So you can only use it as a hint for optimising read order,
or like Lilo, you have to assume the underlying file is not being
changed.
If you use it as a hint there's no big deal if the information is
occasionally wrong due to a race.  Are there any real race conditions
with FIBMAP that cause real problems?
(It's not a great hint for a lot of reasons.  One of them is the
filesystem's tendancy to read ahead in a file, which tends to break your
carefully planned read sequence...)
