OK, thanks, I thought I grepped the module source (qla v6b5 adapter, not
included in the kernel tree), but missed the call to reparent_to_init().
I was wondering why I'd need an export for a function only called from
within in its own file. I removed the reparent_to_init call and it worked
fine.
Perhaps reparent_to_init should now be static?
Thanks.
