I generally agree with you.  But since I actually never heard of
problems that could directly be related to sbp2's DMA areas exceeding
the OHCI-1394 physical DMA range (4GB in most OHCI-1394
implementations), I consider this simple reversion good enough for post
2.6.23-rc1 and especially for 2.6.22.y.
My original commit 0555659.. was a violation of "If it ain't (known)
broken, don't fix it".

Yes, could the PPC folks please have a look at it?  Thanks.
