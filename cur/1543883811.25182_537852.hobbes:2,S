I would understand that switching from text to graphics and vice versa
can trigger display problems (it shouldn't, but it happens), but not
while you are only echoing text to the system console in graphics mode.

Weird. The only thing I can think of is that console blanking is being
triggered while the console is in graphics mode, which is not legal. 
How about 'setterm -blank 1', do an infinite echo loop and wait for at
least 1 minute?
Also, can you open drivers/char/vt.c and look for the function
do_blank_screen?  You should have this particular segment.
Change this
if (console_blanked) {
	if (blank_state == blank_vesa_wait) {
		blank_state = blank_off;
		vc->vc_sw->con_blank(vc, vesa_blank_mode + 1, 0);
	}
	return;
}
to
if (console_blanked && vc->vc_mode == KD_TEXT && !entering_gfx ) {
	if (blank_state == blank_vesa_wait) {
		blank_state = blank_off;
		vc->vc_sw->con_blank(vc, vesa_blank_mode + 1, 0);
	}
	return;
}
Let me know if that even makes a difference.
