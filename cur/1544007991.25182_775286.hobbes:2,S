I'm not sure I understand the purpose of this memory barrier. As soon
as some other CPU acquires object_tree_lock, updates to the boundaries
will be visible due to the implicit memory barriers in locking
functions (see Documentation/memory-barrier.txt for details).
However, I'm wondering why this isn't a smp_wmb() and..

...why don't we have the pairing smp_rmb() here before we read
min_addr and max_addr?
