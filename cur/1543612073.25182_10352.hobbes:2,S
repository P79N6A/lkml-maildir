Time ago I read an interesting article that implemented shared memory over
network ( ATM in that case ) reproducing in large scale the
cache/memory/bus computer architecture.
Shared memory on each node was the equivalent of the CPU cache, a "generic
shared memory repository" was the equivalent of the main memory and the
snooping traffic was running on the network.
I think I picked it up from ACM but I can't find it right now.
