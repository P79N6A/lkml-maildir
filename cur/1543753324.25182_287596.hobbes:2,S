Maybe a simple delay somewhere in the boot sequence would suffice?  Boot
with `mount_delay=10'.
But it sure would be nice to simply get this stuff right somehow.  If the
USB block driver knows that discovery is still in progress it should wait
until it has completed.  (I suggested that before, but wasn't 100% convinced
by the answer).
