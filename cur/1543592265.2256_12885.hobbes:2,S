I can't see getting around moving the net device allocation out of each
low level driver and into the layer above it. That removes
duplicate code and allows syncppp to do the right thing (allocate it itself
for cisco or allow ppp_generic.c do it for PPP). This would make
net device naming consistancy easier.
The low level drivers should not need any awareness of the net device
(possibly other than suggesting a name) as all they do is send and
receive frames.
The rest of the syncppp API should be (re)usable.

Agreed, but it's a good time to call the cats to the herding pen.
