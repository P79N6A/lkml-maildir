Fine. I had a look at their homepage, seems to be interesting hardware.

It is very probably different (4 WR pulses instead of one), the question
is if that causes different hardware behaviour. If there's a spec for it,
then you should definitly obey it.
What I had in mind was that those ioport regions cannot be mmapped on x86,
but it's possible on ppc, AFAIK.
Furthermore, you need to think about correct endianness handling.
Thanks,
