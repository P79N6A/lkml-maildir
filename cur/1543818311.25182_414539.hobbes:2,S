I gathered data on my side too, the three R52 I had reports for used
"ThinkPad R52" but these had different machine type/model. I guess that
the 1846AQG is somehow different, but probably you don't know why?
So I suppose we could add that "ThinkPad H" identifier string to the
hdaps driver after all, as you proposed in the first place. I'm only
worried that the "H" suffix is really short, and I hope that no other
model not supported by the driver (or needing the invert option) will
ever have the same identifier. Time will tell.
Thanks,
