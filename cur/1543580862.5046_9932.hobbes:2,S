could you send me the configuration logs and system boot messages about the
digiboard...
for my part i used agetty on these ports and the board use only one interrupt
(exept if you have many boards...
in that case one interrupt by board ... )
did you executed the DigiLoad command in your boot scripts like instructed in
documentations...
did you put the board drivers (?????.bin) in the right places...
they have to be loaded for the board to work...
