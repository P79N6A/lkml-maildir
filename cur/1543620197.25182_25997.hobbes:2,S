	I second that. It would be great to have a way of knowing what's different 
from vanillia kernel. though:
	* we can't expect each patch to do the 'magic thing'. But at least, those 
big patches lying around could follow this kind of rule. I don't care about 
typos patches, but It would be great to know that (for ex.) the rmap patch is 
there or not.
	* having /usr/src/linux/patches is not practical : it will be a big mess wrt 
to conflict
	The reason why I have not proposed something already is that I have no clue 
how to achieve this purpose. But I still would like to have a way to know 
which big patches have been in my kernel.
sorry,
Thomas
