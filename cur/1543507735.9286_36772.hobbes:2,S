I'm way less than pleased with this -- at least as implemented.
On any system where we go through the pain of forcibly initializing all
the devices and setting up the bridges, you go and change the allocations
afterward.  And with a bug, no less -- you should release the resource
you had before munging res->{start,end}.
I suggest instead fixing this with a PCI_FIXUP_HEADER that sets start+end
if needed, and let the target dependant code notice the start==0 and
assign the resource then.

I'm also not happy with this, though it can be hacked around after
pci_scan_bus returns, if you force me to.
The recent PCI reorg was a good thing, but within days we're slipping
back into a mode that will require every PCI target except x86 to 
re-implement the entire PCI probing and setup process just to get 
around x86-isms.
I would much rather see the pci_scan_bus not do this bus range 
probing thing and make x86 set up what it needs in pcibios_fixup_bus.
I have two files that were down in the alpha directories that ought
to be moved up to drivers/pci for use as library code by port-specific
code.  Most of the entire file is identical between alpha and sparc,
and there's a few things in common with x86 code too.
As a bonus, I have code to reset all the ranges on the bridges to
match what we allocated for.  So you might not need to do that probing
thing at all.
Please consider the attached.
