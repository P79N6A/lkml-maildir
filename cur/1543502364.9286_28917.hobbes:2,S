It castually happend with 2.2.7, I think it was triggered by doing setserial
on a device which was not supported by the compiled-in driver (e.g. /dev/ttyS4
or /dev/cua4), but i can't reproduce it in the moment. Maybe something got
fixed in the meantime.
Still after an insmod and rmmod, a device access to a compiled-in driver
(serial.o) could reproduce the Oops.
