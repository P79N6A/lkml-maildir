The problem AFAIK is usually that there are some buggy older chipset
versions that do not work properly with MMIO, but others do.
That's especially an issue on widely cloned cards like Tulip.
It's not a platform specific thing, more a device specific setting.
Of course some platforms want to disable it completely too, but that's
rare.
