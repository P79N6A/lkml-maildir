This mail should not go to linux-kernel but Red Hat lists (am CCing it only

You should compile 2.2 kernels with kgcc (ie. egcs 1.1.2). Unpatched 2.2
kernels really will not work with gcc 2.96.

That was caused by a bug in gcc, which should be fixed in 7.0beta.
You need a small kernel patch anyway to close the undefined memcpy
references etc. Look at kernel24 src.rpm.
