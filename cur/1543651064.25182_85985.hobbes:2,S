I have uploaded the profiles from Anton's benchmark runs -
http://lse.sourceforge.net/locking/dcache/results/2.5.40/200-base.html
http://lse.sourceforge.net/locking/dcache/results/2.5.40/200-base-nops.html
http://lse.sourceforge.net/locking/dcache/results/2.5.40/200-mm.html

A quick comparison of base and base-nops profiles show this -

Clearly dcache_lock is the killer when 'ps' command is used in
the benchmark. My guess (without looking at 'ps' code) is that
it has to open/close a lot of files in /proc and that increases
the number of acquisitions of dcache_lock. Increased # of acquisition
add to cache line bouncing and contention.
I should add that this is a general trend we see in all workloads
that do a lot of open/closes and so much so that performance is very
sensitive to how close to / your application's working directory
is. You would get much better system time if you compile a kernel
in /linux as compared to say /home/fs01/users/akpm/kernel/linux ;-)

Hmm.. based on Anton's graph it looked more like ~25% difference for
60 or more scripts. At 200 scripts it is ~27.6%. Without the ps
command, it seems more like ~4%.
