    - Encryption at the IP level (IPsec?)
Non-exportable, so cannot go into the standard kernel.
    - ext2 is showing its age on larger partitions; my 3 9 gig drives
      take about a half hour to fsck, and up to a minute just to mount.
      My database server will need support for +2gig files by the end
      of the year.  "go to a 64 bit machine" is not reasonable for
      everyone.  8^)
Solved by Stephen Tweedie's ongoing logging filesystem work.
    - GGI
No.  The kernel needs only to know how to implement a textual console,
provide application access to the device, and allow graphics context
switching.  FBCON satisfies all of these goals, except the latter,
which can be easily added and is in fact planned.
