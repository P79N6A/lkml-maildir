I think probably everyone who has an AMD-756 has reported
this error.  At least, I've not seen any messages from
people saying, "I have an AMD-756 and have never seen this
error."  Most of the time, when the error occurs, it seems
pretty benign.  That is, I haven't noticed it crashing USB
device connections, causing data corruption or OOPSen.
Some folks _have_ reported OOPSen, though, that seemed to
be triggered by the erratum #4 hardware bug.  I think I
may have had one of these a long time ago.
I believe David has found that there definitely are code
paths where this hardware bug can cause failures of various
sorts and that's why the AMD-756 has been blacklisted.
I don't believe these failure code paths have anything to
do with specific debugging configurations.
David/Alan, please correct me if I've got this all wrong.
Thanks,
	Miles
