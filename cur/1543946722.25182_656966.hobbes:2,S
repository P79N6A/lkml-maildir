I think you can revert the tty-bkl-pushdown.patch. Or, as Eric suggested, just
revert this

chunk. I'd prefer to know what Alan's opinion.
HOWEVER. We have another bug here, and this bug is old.
When tiocspgrp() does put_pid(real_tty->pgrp), it is possible that real_tty
has the last reference, and the pid will be actually freed. This means that
tiocgpgrp() and do_task_stat() are not safe (rcu_read_lock() can't help).
We can read the freed/reused memory, and since pid_nr_ns() is not trivial
the kernel can crash. Unlikely, but possible. We need the lock.
Oleg.
