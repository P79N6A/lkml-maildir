Well, using a non batching mode could be real easy, just
call __percpu_counter_add(&counter, inc, 1<<30);
Or define a new percpu_counter_fastadd(&counter, inc);
percpu_counter are nice because handle the CPU hotplug problem,
if we want to use for_each_online_cpu() instead of
for_each_possible_cpu().

Not sure why you said this.
I would like to have a irqsafe percpu_counter, I was preparing such a
patch because we need it for net-next
