Not yet... I've been spending my spare time looking for an md oops :-)
A quick look suggests that it cannot possibly happen ...
cancel_rearming_delayed_workqueue appears to be being called with a
bad "struct workqueue_struct *".  But that really must have been
initialised when the first nfsd thread started...
It looks like cwq in flush_cpu_workqueue is 0x0000040000000100.  Is
that the sort of address you would expect?  Where do alloc_percpu 
data structures live?  The '4' wouldn't be a single-bit memory error,
would it? (that would be too easy).
So: no, no real progress.   Is it repeatable?
