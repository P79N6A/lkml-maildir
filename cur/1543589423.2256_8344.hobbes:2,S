Do a search through the kernel arcvhies for nvidia.  The crashes could just
be the driver.  But heat is always a problem, add fans ;-)

After a crash, reiserfs only cleans up after itself.  If someone else went
in and hosed the metadata (nvidia, bad drive, controller, ide fun with
via), you've still got bad blocks.
This is one possible reason that we've seen more reports than ext2 has.
After a crash, ext2fsck fixes _whatever_ was broken.  log replay in
reiserfs only fixes the operations that were in progress when the system
crashed.
Anyway, those messages show that you've got metadata corruption.  grab the
latest reiserfsprogs from ftp.reiserfs.org and run reiserfsck -x (after
backing things up).
