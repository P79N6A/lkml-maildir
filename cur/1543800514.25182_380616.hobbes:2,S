Few dualhead drivers actually support two different framebuffers,
but the matrox G550 (and G400) drivers do.  Compile one
of those, make sure to configure dualhead support.
After booting up, use "matroxset" to set the 
framebuffer to vga-connector mapping so that the two 
outputs actually show the different framebuffers.
Another way is to use several graphichs cards (AGP getting
the first framebuffer and each PCI card getting others as
the drivers load.)
