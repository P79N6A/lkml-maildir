Isn't this a bit of a problem?  It sounds like PCI_BUS_NUM_RESOURCES is to
small for that system?  If so, some sort of dynamic allocation might be
needed.

grump.  I don't know why people like a blank line before `return': it's
just a waste of screen space.  And the surrounding code in
arch/x86/pci/acpi.c doesn't do this either.

And should we really be silently ignoring this problem?  Should we at least
report it?
