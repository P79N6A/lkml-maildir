Huh?? Not I!
LOOKUP loop/* MODLOAD
LOOKUP input/js* MODLOAD
LOOKUP ppp MODLOAD
LOOKUP usb/lp0 MODLOAD
REGISTER scsi/* PERMISSIONS root.daemon 660
The last is needed for CD buring - and this is a workstation anyway.

I really like devfs (most) for the sane names, and all the other features
found in Richards texts.
Where is THE problem with permissions??
Especially for the permissions point usbfs is bad. Because you never know
what device belongs to what. For examples replug a device or take the Canon
IXUS, wich switch off every 30 seconds without data-transfer. Each time you
get a new criptic usbfs file you have to chmod 666 it blindly ... ???
Btw. Linux might be more insecure due to the many bugs I had to stumble over
in the last month ... (-> so I decided to donate some time reporting each
bug I find [and for my newest RAID one I take a look myself ...])

Writing bash scripts is easier than adding two lines to devfsd.conf?? Btw.
sane users do not use such a mahor/messy distro ...
