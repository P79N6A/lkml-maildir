How is the NFS client to know that these directories are disjoint, or
that no-one will ever create a hard link from one directory to another?
To my knowledge, the only way to ensure this is to put them on different
disk partitions.
I don't know if all Unix systems have this issue, but I have been told
that Solaris at least has it.

That is too narrow a definition: the minimum should be "everyone can
mount their directories and do their work". Your particular setup may be
safe, but that is why we have overrides: the default should be for the
kernel to be conservative, and to _tell_ users what it thinks is wrong.

Your choice.
