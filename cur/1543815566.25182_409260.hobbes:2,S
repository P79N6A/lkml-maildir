Luke is probably still asleep at this time of night, so I'll try to 
answer what I can...

We're a team inside Analog Devices who are maintaining a GNU toolchain, 
uClinux kernel, and user space apps for the Blackfin.  All of this is 
available on our blackfin.uclinux.org site.  We do not expect to go away 
anytime soon.

That should probably be fixed.

Neither, really.  It's been around for a bit, but the uClinux port is 
only now beginning to really take off, and we certainly hope that more 
and more devices will begin using it.

On blackfin.uclinux.org you'll find our local trees and the RPM releases 
we recommend to users.  The Blackfin port is in gcc and binutils 
mainline; we hope to be able to get into the kernel mainline as well. 
If you have additional questions about the chip, please ask.

We do, actually.  We just don't like Outlook.

I'll pass that along to the right people.  Would a "Signed-off-by: 
Analog Devices" (similar to our FSF copyright assignments) be ok or does 
it have to be individuals?  I believe the port actually predates the 
involvement of most of the people working on it now.

 From what I can tell, no we don't, although we'll have to make a small 
change to our uClibc.  (A lot of this code got copied from the m68k port 
initially... that may explain a few things).

Are you referring to the ones in 
include/asm-blackfin/mach-bf533/cdefBF532.h?  These are memory-mapped 
hardware registers (MMRs); do you have any better suggestions how to 
access these?  That file actually comes from our in-house Visual DSP 
compiler, and while there may be better ways of accessing the register 
than those macros, there is something to be said for being able to drop 
in a replacement if future chips have different addresses for these 
registers.
The Blackfin has a lot of peripherals sitting on the same die as the 
core, and they're all accessed through MMRs.
