All,
TASK_UNMAPPED_SIZE is defined in include/asm-i386/processor.h as:
#define TASK_UNMAPPED_SIZE    (TASK_SIZE / 3)
The value of TASK_SIZE is defined as PAGE_OFFSET which is set to 0xC0000000
(page.h).  This works out to be a value of 0x4000000.
The question is:
Are there any negative side effects in defining TASK_UNMAPPED_SIZE to 0x1000000?
By doing this we allow a process to access more memory.  On Oracle it allows us
to grow our buffer size from 1.7 GB to 2.4 GB improving overall performance by
reducing I/O.
Thanks in advance,
