Perhaps using a pointerhackalign trick on this structure where
#define pointerhackalign(x) __attribute__ ((aligned (x)))
and declare
struct klist_node {
...
}  pointerhackalign(2);
Because  __attribute__ ((aligned (x))) could only increase alignment
it will safe to do that and serve as documentation purpose :)
