Subject: [RFC] e-mail clients
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/9/8/22

As I've learned--most web-clients have a hard time sending text only 
e-mail without
wrapping every single line (not very good for patches).  Any suggestions 
about which client to use on lkml?? Pine?? Mutt??
Thunderbird?? Telnet??
