Incremental updates should not be that resource consuming... Having the
repository updated every a few hours would be nice...

Maybe we could put the converted SVN repository (together with the

mirror it (either with svm or rsync) instead of generating it on
their own machine (which takes several hours). 
Is somebody interested ?
