I guess ugly to program is in the eye of the beholder.  The big platforms
have always seemed much worse to me.  When every box is feels free to
change things in arbitrary ways for no good reason.  Or where OS and
other low-level software must know exactly which motherboard they are
running on to work properly.
Gratuitous incompatibilities are the ugliest thing I have ever seen.
Much less ugly then the warts a real platform accumulates because it
is designed to actually be used.
