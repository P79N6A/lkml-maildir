Subject: clean before or after dep?

I'm having a problem building a Red Hat kernel
(kernel-source-2.4.18-10).
It looks a lot like:
	<
http://www.van-dijk.net/linuxkernel/200223/0349.html>
The error message is:
	make[4]: *** No rule to make target `/usr/src/linux-2.4.18-10/drivers/pci/devlist.h', needed by `names.o'.  Stop.
The fix proposed in <
http://www.van-dijk.net/linuxkernel/200223/0432.html>
is to reverse the order of clean and dep:
     a kind soul pointed out that I should do:
    make clean dep
    make bzimage
    instead. Works. Learned a new trick :-)
Now this seems to contradict
	<
http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO-2.html#ss2.3>
which specifies, in step 5:
	bash# make dep
	bash# make clean
Which is the right order for clean and dep?
I've always assumed that they could be combined, as in:
	bash# make dep clean
Am I wrong?
Where is this documented?
