	[Greg Smart]  Yuk, building a kernel doesn't need to be anymore
'user friendly'
	than it already is, besides if you really want to tune a kernel,
don't you want to
	know about all the compile time parameters?  I also think that most
of the things
	you want to configure to meet the above roles aren't compile
optiions anyway.
