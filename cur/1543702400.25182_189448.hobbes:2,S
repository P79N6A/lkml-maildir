oh, well ... if you selected this example ...
Mandrake workaround it mentions was my first attempt to fix this; this did not 
fix the devfs but rather fixed the user-space program that provoked this on 
boot (and that was buggy irrespectively of this problem).
Current 2.6 kernel includes my fix to deadlock condition. Current -mm includes 
one possible fix for race condition; Andrew Morton mentioned that it is 
unlikely to be accepted due to minor changes in VFS layer; I am working on 
another less intrusive fix and overall devfs cleanup.
Would you please instead of citing long obsolete paper show me real example 
and explain *why* it is not fixable. Better yet, would you take some time to 
try to provoke any of those huge races and report back your success (stack 
trace and instructions how to reproduce them are welcome :)
Thank you
