If I have the CPU for a long time. I get a chance to do some work
with it before I become I/O bound, at which time others can use the
CPU while the kernel's ISRs are writing to screen/disk/network/etc.
Typical interactive usage involves using the CPU to figure something
out, then using kernel services  to write results to an output device,
then surrending the CPU while waiting for an input.
If I can get everything done so I can put the results to an output
device, in one 'quantum' it is a definate win because others get to
use the CPU while I'm pondering key-strokes.
