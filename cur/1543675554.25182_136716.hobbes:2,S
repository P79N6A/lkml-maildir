How about an all or nothing approach?  If you really want to get rid
of K&R, change indentation as well, rip out some of the rather
tasteless macros (ZEXPORT, ZEXPORTVA, ZEXTERN, FAR, ...) and so on.
The code is ugly, no doubt, but has the advantage of being close to
the upstream variant.  I would hate to have the combined problems of
ugly and forked code.
You do have a point with the sync size.  The diff between 1.1.3 and
1.1.4 is 90k, of which only some 5k are functional changes.  The rest
extends the copyright times, adds/changes documentation, etc.
