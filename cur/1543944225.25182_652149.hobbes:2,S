We already have this in arch/x86/Kconfig.debug:
config DOUBLEFAULT
        default y
        bool "Enable doublefault exception handler" if EMBEDDED
        depends on X86_32
        help
          This option allows trapping of rare doublefault exceptions that
          would otherwise cause a system to silently reboot. Disabling this
          option saves about 4k and might cause you much additional grey
          hair.
It may need a small update if this is valid for both 32 and 64 bit.
