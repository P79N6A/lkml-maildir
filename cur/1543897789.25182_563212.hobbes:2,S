Mmm... so I should provide new syscalls for _all_
architectures... gulp! :)
It could be acceptable, just for the first release, to provide the
support for x86 only?
In this manner we can have a first release of LinuxPPS in the main
line just for x86 and then me, or other people, may add support for
the several supported architectures.

I already have a basic testing program... I can add it into
Documentation/pps directory, can't I?
