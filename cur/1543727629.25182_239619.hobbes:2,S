Hi Andrew,
I remember fixing this long time ago when we are playing we large
readhead testing. But I don't see the fix making into the tree.
The problem is, if we increase our readhead size arbitrarily 
(say 2M), we call mpage_readpages() with 2M and when it tries 
allocated bio enough to fit 2M it fails, then we kick it back
to "confused" code - which does 4K at a time.
Fix is to, ask for the maxium driver can handle.
Please include this patch.
Thanks,
Badari
