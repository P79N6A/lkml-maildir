Subject: [PATCH] reduce CONFIG_INPUT as forward symbol
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
I've been using gcml2 from Greg Banks to look at CONFIG_
variable dependencies in config.in files.
By moving drivers/input/config.in before drivers/char/Config.in
and drivers/usb/Config.in for arch/alpha and arch/mips(64),
several (7) instances of this message:
  forward declared symbol "CONFIG_INPUT" used in dependency list
and (6) instances of this one:
  forward declared symbol "CONFIG_SOUND_GAMEPORT" used in
  dependency list
can be removed.  (Yes, the latter one is for OSS drivers,
so it's not so important.)
It also adds one forward dependency for a USB joystick
in the input subsystem [still only for alpha and mips(64)].
Most other arches are already like this.
This patch is to 2.5.31-bk7 (jgarzik's latest snapshot).
Please apply.
