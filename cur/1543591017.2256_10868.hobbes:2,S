Wrong approach, you can use kiobufs if you want DMA to the malloc()ed
userspace memory:
 * lock down the user memory using map_user_kiobuf() + lock_kiovec()
   (see linux/iobuf.h).
 * translate the iobuf->maplist into a scatterlist [1]
 * feed pci_map_sg() with the scatterlist to get DMA addresses.
   you can pass to the hardware.
And the reverse to free everything when you are done of course.

[1] IMHO it would be more useful if iobufs would use a scatterlist
    instead of an struct page* array.
