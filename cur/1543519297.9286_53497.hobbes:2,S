I've been using RedHat since 4.x days, and have never seen any
2.1.x kernels or 1.3.x kernels in any official RedHat
distribution.  Rawhide may or may not have such a kernel
included, but I've never seen an official release with any devel
kernel.  The closest I've seen is a RedHat kernel that was a pre
of a stable kernel.  I don't consider that a devel kernel,
because RedHat kernels are traditionally patched so much that
they contain a fair amount of stuff not in official kernels
anyways.
I know that there are dists out there that ship devel kernels,
but they are mostly hacker kernels, and are definitely not
mainstream.
Yep, SLS is certainly way before me.  ;o)  Slackware with kernel
1.2.8 was my first..  ;o)
