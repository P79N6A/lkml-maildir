I've tested both versions of the test program on two Athlon64 boxes,
and neither has had any problems with them.
My two machines are both VIA K8T800-based (a desktop and a laptop),
but it seems those of you who had problems have nForce-based machines.
So presumably it's either the nForce chipset or your memory timings are
out of spec.
