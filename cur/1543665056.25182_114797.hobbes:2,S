Your patch makes it impossible to tell at an easy glance which syscall 
is which number.  The current code makes it quite obvious which numbers 
are assigned to which syscalls, and which syscall numbers are available 
for use.  We lose valuable information with this patch, even if it does 
wind up to be functionally equivalent.
