Thanks for letting us know about it.
Does this project have a web page?

Does this suggest adding yet another hotswap/hotplug mechanism
to Linux?  It would be a good thing to unify them IMHO.
Does this hotswap mechanism require userspace software to activate it?
If so, is it available or being developed also?
