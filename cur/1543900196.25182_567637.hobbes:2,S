Which doesn't really suprise me. Order-1 and order-2 allocation succeed
today because there are so few users of them. Order-1 is sometimes used
for stacks and the occasional wireless driver instead of on a regular
basis.
We still need to revisit the watermark handling before pushing this
aspect of SLUB forward but I'd like to see grouping pages by mobility go
forward first so the work is not pie-in-the-sky. I'm sure it can be
handled better than what we do in -mm today but it's good to know we
have a comparison point. The first stab at watermark handling may not be
the best approach but it's held up pretty well so far.
