Wrong, GCC is behaving correctly.

p is a variable.  The _address_ of p is constant, but the reload is
not loading the address of p, it's loading the _value_.  That value can
be changed by other threads.
In fact, you have demonstrated why the "memory" clobber is necessary for
spinlocks.  A perfect test case!
In your first example, without the clobber, the asm code is incorrect.
A parallel thread can change the value of p between the first
spin_unlock and the second spin_lock, and the GCC-generated code does
not notice.

Here, the saved cycle is a kernel bug.
