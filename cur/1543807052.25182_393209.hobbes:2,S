Again, neither read, nor write did result in disk offline. (Even though 
I'm not quite positive on trying the writing under Linux.) And it 
definitelly wasn't caused by the controller, since I was doing both reads 
and writes to that "faulty" array from Windows and all those operations 
completed without any problem.

However I was able to read the Linux Ext3 data (from the /dev/sda2) 
partition using the Total Commander's ext2 plugin from Windows, and that 
worked well for the entire partition (both reads and writes).
Are you a 100% certain it must have been bad physical sectors? Since I'm 
not all that sure.

This has nothing to do with filesystems, since no access was possible at 
all to that block device entirely.

OK, this is probably also something needed to be improved if there is the 
problem as well, but it is a totally different case than what happend 
here. This certainly had nothing to do with filesystems. As (as I've 
mentioned earlier) not even plain access to the whole /dev/sda using dd(1) 
was working.
