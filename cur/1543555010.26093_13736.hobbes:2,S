Whether or not the assumptions are made, the last testN series of kernels have
introduced two serious issues IMO.  The first is the mysterious deadlocks and
no way to figure them out.  With kdb the machine won't hang.  Without it, it
deadlocks within 36 hours.
The second issue is usb.  I now have two machines that lockup on boot in USB.
One is the above workstation, the second is a Compaq laptop.  Unfortunately
I have no way of unplugging the USB hardware inside the laptop :P
