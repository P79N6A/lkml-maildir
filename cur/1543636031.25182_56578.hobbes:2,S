Looking through some tuning documentation about sysctl values as related
to Oracle and other DB tuning bits, I noticed that the following don't
exist anymore, and was curious where or if they were moved.
/proc/sys/kernel/inode-max
/proc/sys/vm/freepages
In coincidence with this info, I was curious if anyone has tweaked the
following and if it makes any difference, with regard to performance:
/proc/fs/pagebuf
/proc/sys/vm/pagebuf
/proc/sys/vm/pagebuf/max_dio_pages
/proc/sys/vm/page-cluster
/proc/sys/vm/pagetable_cache
