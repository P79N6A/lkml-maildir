Try making all your input layer as built in rather than modules.  Check 
your console specification.  If you have framebuffer support compiled in, 
make sure you have console on framebuffer enabled also.
I've run into something similar-sounding as I've been playing with 2.5.59 
and later.  It's looking as if people need to be very careful about how 
they specify console support.
