First - I'm proposing a concept, not writing the
implementation of the concept. You are asking what
happens when someone write conflicting rules. That
depends on how you implement it. Conflicting rules can
cause unpredictable results.
It may be as simple as first rule wins. Or it may
require all the rules to be true. In the above example
I would say it is not allowed because it matches a
denial condition. 
The point is that one can choose any rule system they
want and the rules applies to the names of the files
and the permissions of the users.

All you would have to do is create a set of rules that
emulates the current rules and you would have the same
results.
