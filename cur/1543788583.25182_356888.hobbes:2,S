  Unfortunately, SATA hoplug support is not ready yet.  Preliminary 
works are in progress though and it will happen.  Of course, I have 
absolutely no idea how distant the future is. :-)
  One more thing to note is that nVidia cannot supply information 
regarding SATA part (I think network part too) of its chipset to open 
source community.  So, it is possible that not everything goes smoothly 
with nf4 hotplug support even after other pieces come together eventually.
  If you're looking for stability/resilience for production machine, 
IMHO libata isn't still quite ready.
  libata maintainer Jeff Garzik maintains the following status page you 
might be interested in.
