Andrew told me already today that Jeff[1] had sent a patch fixing all that. To
prevent the leaks he's calling sx_release_io_range(bp) in every check before
exiting sx_probe so this seems correct. A small question though: After calling
sx_request_io_range() in the if-statement on line 499 is it ok to call
sx_request_io_range() for a second time in a row on line 587?  I think in
this case the second call has to go, no?
