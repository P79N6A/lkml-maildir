hm, i dont know OpenVMS - but googled around a bit for 'VMS 
asynchronous' and it gave me this:
  
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_system_trap
is AST what you mean? From a quick read AST seems to be a signal 
mechanism a bit like Unix signals, extended to kernel-space as well - 
while syslets are a different 'safe execution engine' kind of thing 
centered around the execution of system calls.
