One general issue -- as noted again by Christoph Lameter recently --
is that the order 0 fast path in page_alloc.c isn't actually very 
fast. That is why people keep inventing their own...

To do the same as quicklists you would need a __free_pages_zeroed()
and separate buddy lists I think.  Later is probably somewhat ugly.
Or perhaps do it only for order 0?
Or perhaps idle time zeroing should be reinvestigated on modern CPUs,
but I'm always a little sceptical of that.
