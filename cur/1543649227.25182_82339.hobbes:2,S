When filesystems want to access metadata, they will typically read
a block into a buffer_head and access the memory directly.
 mnm:/usr/src/25> grep -rI b_data fs | wc -l
    844
That's a lot of kmaps need adding.
So we constrain blockdev->bd_inode->i_mapping->gfp_mask so that
the blockdev's pagecache memory is always in the direct-addressed
region.
It would be possible to fix on a per-fs basis - teach a filesystem
to kmap bh->b_page appropriately and then set __GFP_HIGHMEM in the
blockdev's gfp_mask.
But it doesn't seem to cause a lot of trouble in practice.
