Cute.  
In this case, mem=0x3ff0000 is EXACTLY what you want, because the table
which will be built is 0009fc00 @ 00000000; 03ef0000 @ 00100000.  (Recall
that the ACPI memory is available at this point.)
Alan, this looks common enough that I'm going to go ahead and add this to
the patch--an option to disable available memory in the 000a0000-0010000
range.  Even if it turns out that this issue is our problem, we don't know
where the next one will come from.

Ok, I found out. Mingo's patch gives error at e8000. That's somewhere
below 1MB. It seems toshiba messed up their tables, grr.
