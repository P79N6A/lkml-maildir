Yep.

Actually, OCP stands for On-Chip Peripheral and is the basic system
we've used in ppc32 for some time now to abstract dumb peripherals
behind a standard API.  BenH did yet another rewrite of OCP in 2.4
sometime ago and I picked up that work to port to 2.6 and the new
device model.  It is a software abstraction, and easily allows us to
plug in SoC descriptors when new chips come out and use standard
apis to modify device entries on a per-board basis during
"setup_arch() time". It used to be PPC4xx-specific, but now is being
used by PPC85xx, MV64xxx, and MPC52xx based PPC systems. "Now", meaning
that the respective developers for those parts are using the OCP
working tree to base their 2.6 ports off of.

Ahh, good.
