Looks like I already found it by looking at the driver source.
struct eisa_device_id el3_eisa_ids[] = {
                { "TCM5092" },
                { "TCM5093" },
                { "TCM5095" },     <==== I added this line
                { "" }
};
and now it works.
EISA: Probing bus 0 at 0000:00:06.0
EISA: Mainboard ACR1C01 detected.
EISA: slot 2 : TCM5095 detected.
EISA: slot 3 : TCM5095 detected.
EISA: slot 4 : TCM5095 detected.
EISA: slot 5 : TCM5093 detected.
EISA: Detected 4 cards.
I'm not sure if it will work with ISA cards in ISA mode.
As I pointed out above, this machine does not want to
initialize EISA bus if at least one of the cards isn't
in EISA mode.  Will "plain" (in ISA mode) 3c509 be shown
in EISA scan too?
