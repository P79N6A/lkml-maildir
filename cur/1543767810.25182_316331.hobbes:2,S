I already changed my scripts to be able to do that. They default to HEAD, 
but if you tell them something else, they'll get that instead.
So I'd do a
	git-pull-script foo://.../libata-2.6.git/ HEAD-for-linus
except right now my pull script only works with rsync or ssh, not http. 
I'll fix that up asap.
