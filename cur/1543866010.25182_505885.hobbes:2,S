as i pointed it out in the previous mail, the problem is that what you 
suggested results in preisely that - a count in the wrong place:

changing the current 'timer' entry (which is line 2 of /proc/interrupts) 
to be 'listed as lapic-timer' and to 'replace it with the count from 
LOC' is faking a count in a line where nothing like that should be.
the kernel simply displays reality: IRQ#0 isnt increasing because it's 
not used, and LOC (local apic timers) is increasing.
