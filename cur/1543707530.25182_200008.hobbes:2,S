I've been experiencing hangs with -mm kernels and my CardBus 3Com NIC
when resuming from APM suspend to disk which seem to be caused by the
3c59x driver. The hang just gets resolved by unplugging, then plugging
the CardBus NIC. This doesn't happen with vanilla tree, however.
I've found that reverting 3c9x-enable_wol.patch fixes this situation for
me.
