Hi all,
Here's a resend of the patch to fix the 2.4 PCMCIA linear flash cards.
Looks like I was using the non-working sourceforge address for David 
Hinds. CC:ing Marcelo Tosatti too.
The patch is against 2.4.17, but works on other recent kernels too. 
(I just tested it against 2.4.19-pre4)
Linear flash card are rarely used, but are needed to boot some embedded
systems, like the AMD ELAN. They are also used in some Cisco routers.
Just FYI, here's some Linux related projects where linear flash cards
may be used:
Wireless access points running Linux:

Alios boot loader for AMD ELAN:
http://www.telos.de/linux/alios/default_e.htm
Read Cisco flash cards from Linux:
ftp://ftp.bbc.co.uk/pub/ciscoflash/
Here's a short description of the fix:
Basically there were two problems; The RegisterMTD ioctl was
accidentally dropped at some point, so the flash cards would not
register. Then the reference to the flash card memory window was
incorrect, so the cards were not seen, and the flash drivers would
not unload after use.
Regards,
Tony
