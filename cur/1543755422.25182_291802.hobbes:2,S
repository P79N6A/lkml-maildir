So far I have not had time to focus on benchmarking that.

Introducing pte locking would allow us to go further with parallelizing
this but its another invasive procedure. I think parallelizing COW is only
possible to do reliable with some pte locking scheme. But then the
question is if the pte locking is really faster than obtaining a spinlock.
I suspect this may not be the case.

The unmapping in rmap.c would change the pte. This would be discovered
after acquiring the spinlock later in do_wp_page. Which would then lead to
the operation being abandoned.
