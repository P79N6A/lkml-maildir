it seems I explained too fuzzy/I had to explain it better
what I wanted to try is avoidoiding irq latency paths in the CPU where is
executing the ISR, where I'm interested not delaying time stamps by any other
means. 
And yes... maybe I'm a little paranoid about this, but doing an 
echo <something> > /proc/irqs/[0-9]*/smp_affinity is cheap
and it's supossed? I should get better results... or not?
anyway... 
I did not expect to increase global latency to these results...
and neither to increase latency in the CPU that's receiving 
just one interrupt!
