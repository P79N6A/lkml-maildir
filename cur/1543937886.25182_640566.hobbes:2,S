there's no exclusion enforced right now, and if a CPU is PAT-incapable 
(or if the kernel is booted nopat) then the MTRR bits should be usable. 
But if we boot with PAT enabled, and Xorg gets /proc/mtrr wrong, we'll 
see nasty crashes. If it gets them right, it should all still work just 
fine. Is this ok? Then, in a year or two, distros can disable write 
support to /proc/mtrr. Hm?
