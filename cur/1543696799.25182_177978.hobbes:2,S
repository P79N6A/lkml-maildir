Just a comment about 2.6.0-test9-mm2, using elevator=deadline
So far, almost everything is working very very well, thanks guys.  
I've been running test9-mm2 for most of its life.  But mm3 is 
building right now, thanks Andrew.
One minor thing.  Playing some music I'd just ripped to ogg's, using 
xmms, about 1 in 20 refused to play, like the ogg player didn't 
start.  Quitting and restarting xmms moved the no-play to another 
song or songs.  Nothing reported in the logs.  I also realise this 
isn't anywhere near enough info, more of a trivia detail, to be 
recalled if someone else reports something similar.
