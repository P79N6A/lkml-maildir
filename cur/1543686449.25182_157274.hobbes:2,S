You don't accidentially enable such an option.
Currently, I see every day reports about compile errors on
linux-kernel - reports for errors that are known and unfixed since 
several months.
A dependency on BROKEN is a clear mark that a compile error is already 
known.
My personal opinions:
- Ideally, every valid configuration should result in a kernel that
  both compiles and works.
- Every compile error gives a bad impression of the quality of the 
  Linux kernel.
Current 2.4 kernels are (on i386) relatively near to this ideal.
It's not only a technical aspect, it's also a marketing aspect.  With
many broken drivers it's easy for people to argue against Linux using
arguments like
  Look, what a crap Linux is, the developers even care whether the 
  kernel compiles.
