is the EXTRAVERSION set properly in Makefile? I use the 
http://www.bzimage.org
intermediate diff (chosen ~40K to ~2M) from ac6 nd I still have
2.4.4-ac6 login prompt (and Makefile says: EXTRAVERSION = -ac6).
The other thing I noticed is:
 depmod
depmod: *** Unresolved symbols in /lib/modules/2.4.4-ac6/kernel/fs/nfs/nfs.o
 modprobe nfs
/lib/modules/2.4.4-ac6/kernel/fs/nfs/nfs.o: unresolved symbol filemap_fdatawait_Rd4250148
/lib/modules/2.4.4-ac6/kernel/fs/nfs/nfs.o: unresolved symbol filemap_fdatasync_Rf18ce7a1
/lib/modules/2.4.4-ac6/kernel/fs/nfs/nfs.o: insmod /lib/modules/2.4.4-ac6/kernel/fs/nfs/nfs.o failed
/lib/modules/2.4.4-ac6/kernel/fs/nfs/nfs.o: insmod nfs failed
I don't use it, must've checked it in by mistake. Nevertheless I report
:-)
regards and bye
