I haven't been following that thread as closely as I should be, so I
don't have an answer.  I guess the interesting thing in this patch is
that it only uses the pmd cache for usermode pmds (which are
pre-zeroed), and normal page allocations for kernel pmds.  Also, if the
kernel pmds are unshared, the pgds are page-sized, so its not really
making good use of the pgd cache.
