Which doesn't solve the problem as this means the end user will have
to recompile his/her kernel to debug things. When Joe Random is
sitting with his favorite distro CD trying to install it on a brand
new motherboard doing funky things in it's ACPI routing or something
like that, it's very useful for SuSE/Red Hat/Mandrake/Debian etc. to
be able to instruct him to set this debug flag and tell them what
happens.
Cheers,
Jes
