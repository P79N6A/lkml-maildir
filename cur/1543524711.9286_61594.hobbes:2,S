Could it be the es1371 ?
I used this card on a dual PII with 2.2.14 and had no problems. But
with 2.2.15pre3 and pre4 the system will lock up hard. Sometimes after
5-10 minutes, sometimes immediately when I first use sound.
It boots fine, finds the card etc. But using the card will kill the
system.   Using the driver as a module or linking it directly into
the kernel makes no difference.
