Fine so far.

In other words, if a patch is available for the 1.0.0 kernel, they
can claim "Linux compatible" ??? That's meaningless...replace with
something like...
   Linux 2.2.2 compatible:
       Source code driver is available as a patch for the stated
       mainline kernel.
...with the specific version to be made explicit. As a minimum, it
needs to state the actual kernel series the patch is for.

Similar comments apply. Again, require that the kernel that driver
works with is made explicit.

So a company provides a product for $5,000.00 and donates $0.01 of
the purchase price to the specified organisation, thus entitling
themselves to say "Supports Linux" by this rule. Can I suggest
this alternative definition:
   Supports Linux:
       At least 1% of the purchase price will be donated to
       Linux International.

Agreed.

That's not necessary - just define:
   Runs under Linux:
       This product work on a system based on a mainline Linux
       kernel without making any modification to the kernel
       itself or loading any kernel modules.
That is all that is required there.
Best wishes from Riley.
