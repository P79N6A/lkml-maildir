I'd rather the common functions just get used directly and cast as
necessary...but it's your code.  Or define a few generic structs
and get a pointer to those and get typechecking for free.

Again, I could live with it, but would suggest just coding it directly and
maybe just add a comment that this really only wants 24 bits (I thought it was 21 bits,
but then again, I know next to squat about scsi).  <shrug>

OK, if you'd rather keep the array-of-bytes and use the offsets method,
that's fine too.
Something like (is this really so bad?):
	store_be32_noalign((__be32 *)&buf[0], curlun->num_sectors - 1);
	store_be32_noalign((__be32 *)&buf[4], 512);

Personally I don't think it's that ugly just using the common functions
directly. BTW, note that if you know the alignment, there are aligned versions
coming as well.  YMMV.
