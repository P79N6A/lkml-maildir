Ok, I have downlaoded git and started the first compile.
Git will tell when the correct point is found (assuming I
do the "git bisect bad/good" right), by itself?
Is there any way to make git tell exactly where between rc4 and rc5
each kernel is, so I can name the bzimages accordingly?
It takes some time to trigger the bug, so I could possibly end up with
a falsely ok kernel.  Is there a simple way to restart the search from 
that point,
or will I have to start over with rc4 and rc5 and say
git bisect good/bad until I reach the point of mistake?
