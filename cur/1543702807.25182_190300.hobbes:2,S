Personally, I don't care very much - it's useful to know the affected
port range vs the machine, so when other people have the same problem
we don't have to re-investigate.
I'd rather there was some way to automatically mark these pesky regions
in the resource manager so we didn't have to do this, but I guess that's
going to be too much.
