Andrea, 
Martin first reported problems with "gzip -dc file | less" (280MB file).
less was getting killed. He had no swap... I asked him to add some swap
and it works now. Fine. 
The thing is that with 2.4.22 less was being killed, but with 2.4.23-pre
he gets:
>> And yes, the app was killed:

So a lot of processes which should not get killed are dying. This is
really bad. I was afraid it could happen and it did.
What now? Resurrect OOM-killer?

With 2.4.22:
