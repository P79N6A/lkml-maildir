This can be fixed (so that is compiles) by just changing line 1046 from:
bio.bi_io_vec.bv_len = lvm_get_blksize(bio.bi_dev);
to
bio.bi_io_vec->bv_len = lvm_get_blksize(bio.bi_dev);
This is due to changes in the I/O layer. You used to only have one
bio_vec struct in the bio struct, but now it has changed to a linked
list.
Warning: This makes it compile, but it does not necessarily make it
work, but I might. :) Since the rest of LVM hasn't been changed to
use the new linked-list-possibility, it shouldn't make a difference.
