Unfortunately the kernel _does_ care about them. Every signal has a
default behavior determined by the kernel, and that behavior matters.
So you don't think the patch is important... but is is bad?
Proper default behavior can not be defined without defining
what each signal maps to.
Benefits:
kernel  -->  developers will know what is used for what
libc 5  -->  gets signals that are needed
libc 6  -->  developers get an assurance of stability
Please apply this patch. I can produce another with the SIGEMT
and SIGSYS signals reversed if you prefer.
