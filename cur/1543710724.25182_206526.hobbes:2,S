Hi,
I noticed that major 115 points on /dev/speaker. 
Nevertheless, this number has been officially (?) allocated to me for tipar.o and tiglusb.o modules in March 2002. These modules are within the 2.4 & 2.6 kernels.
Is there anyone who can tell me whether it's correct ? May a conflict be possible with the speaker device if tipar/tiglusb are loaded ?
Thanks, Romain.
