Subject: How to add a drive to DMA black list?

Hello all,
I have an ide hard drive that misbehaves when the option "enable DMA at 
boot time" (2.4.x kernel) is selected (this is on a on board ide 
controller). But on the other hand I have a Promise Ultra-ATA-100 
controller with an IBM ATA-100 drive that, according to the menuconfig 
information and the information at the top of the driver requires the 
"enable DMA at boot time" feature to be selected.
I tried adding the string that is output for the bad drive by hdparm -i 
into drivers/ide/ide-dma.c::drive_blacklist and 
drivers/ide/ide-dma.c::bad_dma_drives but the kernel still says that it is 
using DMA and the kernel hangs after displaying:

Dead.
What should I do? Thanks in advance,
