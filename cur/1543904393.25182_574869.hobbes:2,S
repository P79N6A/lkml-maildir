Subject: [PATCH] Allow nodes to exist that only contain ZONE_MOVABLE
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/25/333

With the introduction of kernelcore=, a configurable zone is created on
request. In some cases, this value will be small enough that some nodes
contain only ZONE_MOVABLE. On some NUMA configurations when this occurs,
arch-independent zone-sizing will get the size of the memory holes within the
node incorrect. The value of present_pages goes negative and the boot fails.
This patch fixes the bug in the calculation of the size of the hole. The
test case is to boot test a NUMA machine with a low value of kernelcore=
before and after the patch is applied. While this bug exists in early kernel
it cannot be triggered in practice.
This patch has been boot-tested on a variety machines with and without
kernelcore= set.
