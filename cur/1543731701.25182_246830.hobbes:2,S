I am confident that this problem (as far as process monitoring is
concerned) could be addressed with differential notification.

I'd much rather remove unnecessary overhead than optimize code for
overhead processing. Note that number() takes out 7% and that's the
_kernel_ printing numbers for user space to parse back. And __d_lookup
is another /proc souvenir you get to keep as long as you use /proc.

Well __task_mem is promiment here because I don't call other computation
functions. vmstat ain't cheap, and wchan is horribly expensive if the
kernel does the ksym translation. Etc. pp.
