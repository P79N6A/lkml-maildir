_All_ of them are piped through the 4Gb address space. I.e. every segment
is mapped to a part of the same (for all segments) 4Gb. That address space
is, in turn, mapped to 64Gb of physical memory. At any moment you can't
get more than 2^32 different elements of physical memory accessible, even
though you have 48 bits of address in the beginning and 36 bits in the
end.
Think of it that way: we have two functions:
u32 map_segment(u48);
u36 map_paging(u32);
and processor does map_paging(map_segment(address)) when it calculates the
physical addresses. Even though both the range and domain are larger than
2^32, the number of different values is less or equal to it.

Virtual address gives linear address. _Then_ it is translated into
physical address. Page tables describe the latter mapping. Descriptor
tables - the former. Size of linear address is the bottleneck here and no
changes past that bottleneck can expand the number of possible values.
