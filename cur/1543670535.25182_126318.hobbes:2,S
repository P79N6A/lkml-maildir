"cvsup" is for synching repositories (I was not talking about "cvs up" - 
the command line). It achives the exact same end effect as rsync, except 
it is much more bandwidth efficient when used to sync CVS repositories. 
Homepage at 
http://www.cvsup.org/.
As Adam Richter said in private, however, the tool is a bitch to 
compile. It is written in Modula-3, and most people don't have the 
development environment to build it. Add to that the fact that most 
distros don't carry it as a package (a while back I tried, 
unsuccessfully, to locate an RPM for it, anywhere), and you get 
something that should be deployed with care.
On the other hand, both Wine (where I got to know it) and KDE seem to 
offer cvsup for getting the repository, so it can't be THAT difficult. 
As also noted above, Debian does carry it in easy to deploy .deb, as 
part of the main distro's archive (confirmed available on stable).
