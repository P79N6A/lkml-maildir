Hi James !
Why did you move the driver includes to include/video ? What is 
the reasoning here ?
For example, drivers/video/radeon.h moved to include/video/radeon.h
Is this to be able to share register definitions with the DRM drivers ?
(I doubt this will ever happen as the DRM is rather self contained)
I would have preferred those includes to stay next to their respective
drivers (though renaming radeon.h to radeonfb.h might have made some
sense).
Regards,
Ben.
