Hi!
Since you've got
-static void __migrate_task(struct task_struct *p, int src_cpu, int dest_cpu)
+static int __migrate_task(struct task_struct *p, int src_cpu, int dest_cpu)
 {
        runqueue_t *rq_dest, *rq_src;
+       int res = 0;
 
        if (unlikely(cpu_is_offline(dest_cpu)))
-               return;
+               return 0;
why not return res here?
oh and ret is a more commonly used name than res (your choice of course).
and an addition to the comment such as "returns non-zero only when it fails to 
migrate the task" would be nice.
thanks!
