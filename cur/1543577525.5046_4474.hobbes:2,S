I can confirm these symptoms on my system with a Voodoo3/3000/PCI and a
SiS530 motherboard (AMD K6/2).  I get both the "mtrr: ... overlaps
existing ..." message some extent of the text corruption.  With VESA fb,
I get the random lines of colored pixels.  With tdfxfb, the most
noticable problem is that the cursor is several times larger than it
should be (like 1"x1").  Additionally, with the standard console, upon
switching from X, 1 or 2 cells with have randomly colored letters in
them, and some letters ("h" particularly) always appear incorrectly.
