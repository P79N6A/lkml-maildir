We were talking about
#if 0
/* Don't turn this on, fix your code instead */
void __bad_udelay(int c)
{
#error you broke it. read the damn comment
}
#endif
... so that when people search the tree for __bad_udelay they find this, 
and if they're silly enough to change the 0 to a 1 then it'll still break.
