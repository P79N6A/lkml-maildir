Hi,
I think I forgot to include the subject on the email I sent last time.
Not sure how many people saw it. I'm trying to send this message again...
I have two questions on Linux pthread related issues. Would anyone be able 
to help?
1. Does any one have some suggestions (pointers) on good kernel Linux thread 
libraries?
2. We ran multi-threaded application using Linux pthread library on 2-way 
SMP and UP intel platforms (with both 2.2 and 2.4 kernels). We see 
significant increase in context switching when moving from UP to SMP, and 
high CPU usage with no performance gain in turns of actual work being done 
when moving to SMP, despite the fact the benchmark we are running is 
CPU-bound. The kernel profiler indicates that the a lot of kernel CPU ticks 
went to scheduling and signaling overheads. Has anyone seen something like 
this before with pthread applications running on SMP platforms? Any 
suggestions or pointers on this subject?
Ying
