Hi,
I have  installed kde-2 on my linux machine(2.2.14-12 kernel). When
I give startx it goes to KDE screen. When I click on any one of the
applications for eg:-a new terminal or word application, it gives a core
dump and comes out of KDE. Please tell me the reasons for this and a
probable solution so that I need not reinstall the OS.
Thanks in advance,
Warm regards,
sathish.j
