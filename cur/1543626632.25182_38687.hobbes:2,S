You need to do the same thing in entry.S ... Ingo decoupled the two
entry paths from each other (entry.S does preempt_schedule's work on its
own, and then directly calls schedule).
So, right now the ret_from_intr path sets the task state to
TASK_RUNNING.  That needs to be replaced with a jump out if it is NOT
task running.
Curiously, what is wrong with the way we did it in the original patch? 
I.e. set a bit in preempt_count and use that to skip to pick_next_task
in schedule.  This allows us to preempt any task of any state ...
