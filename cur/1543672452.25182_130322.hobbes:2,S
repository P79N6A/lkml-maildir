I see, that would indeed be a bigger job :). Just the block layer would
not be hard, especially if you make the restriction that the block
drivers usable would be ones that used a make_request strategy for
handling requests. That would allow you to kill ll_rw_blk.c,
deadline-iosched.c, and elevator.c. That's some 21k of text and 2k of
data on this box.
