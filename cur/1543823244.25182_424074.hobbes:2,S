What does it mean if the flags can be modified? If I mount a tree ro, do 
I want to open the can of worms from allowing part of it to be rw 
elsewhere? And what checking is done, or should be done? If I do a ro 
mount with something like NFS, what should happen if I mount part of it 
rw? Substitute any of the other above flags, is there a security issue 
here, and can I shoot myself in the foot?
Can I apply the "user" attribute in fstab to a bind mount? If I let a 
user bind /foo/bar to /bazfaz/zot, what happens if I have the wrong 
thing mounted on /foo? Or if /bazfaz is NFS exported read only?

That certainly is a lot less likely to violate Plauger's law of least 
astonishment.
