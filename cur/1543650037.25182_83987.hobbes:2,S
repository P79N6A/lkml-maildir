Subject: Pauses in 2.5.44 (some kind of memory policy change?)

	I run /usr/bin/mail to read my mail box file, which has about
24 megabytes (in 2300 messages, mostly spam).  After this, about half
of the time, my keyboard and mouse will intermittently stop responding
for a second or two, maybe one or two times, and then everything
seems to be OK.  This happens *after* the mail spool has been read.
This did not happen in previous kernels (well, maybe 2.5.43, I can't
quite be sure about that one).
	The mail spool is on NFS, but I suspect the culprit might be
some kind of memory balancing change in 2.5.44.
