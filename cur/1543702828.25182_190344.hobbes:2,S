I'm seeing this also. Started in 2.6.1-mm1 with the debug change to
list.h  I've got a fairly repeatable case I can create:
Bring computer up and let it run a while - 1 hour or so. Start rsync
process to backup system. This seems to trip it almost every time. If I
boot directly into runlevel 1 and immediately do the same rsync backup,
it will work fine.
When I first hit it, I had preemption enabled. I re-compiled without it,
and it made no difference.
