The fundamental reason these are proliferating is that given
some random bit of code such as:
    u64 foo=9, bar=3, baz;
    baz = foo / bar;
    baz = foo % bar;
gcc then generates code calling __udivdi3 and __umoddi3.  Since
the kernel does not provide these, people keep reinventing them.
Perhaps it is time to kill off do_div and all its little friends
and simply copy __udivdi3 and __umoddi3 from libgcc.....
