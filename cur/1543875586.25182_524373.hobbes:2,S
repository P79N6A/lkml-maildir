It basically creates a specified number of threads and hammers the query port of the server with logged real-world queries. This works fine over ipv4. But if I switch to ipv6 (meaning, instead of the ipv4 address of eth0, I give the ipv6 one to getaddrinfo()), strange connection reset/timeout problems arise. This is especially strange because it's all AF-independent, so the very same piece of code runs fine for ipv4, but fails for ipv6.
Hello Agoston
Could you please repost your mail on netdev@vger.kernel.org, because this address is more appropriate to get in touch with networking guys :)
Thank you
