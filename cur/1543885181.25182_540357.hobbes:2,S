Yes but this alignement is dynamic, not at compile time.
include/asm-i386/processor.h:739:#define cache_line_size() 
(boot_cpu_data.x86_cache_alignment)
So adding ____cacheline_aligned  to 'struct file' for example would be a 
regression for people with PII or PIII

On a typical system, number of pages for 'filp' kmem_cache tends to be stable
-bash-2.05b# grep filp /proc/slabinfo
filp              234727 374100    256   15    1 : tunables  120   60    8 : 
slabdata  24940  24940    135
-bash-2.05b# grep filp /proc/slabinfo
filp              234776 374100    256   15    1 : tunables  120   60    8 : 
slabdata  24940  24940    168
-bash-2.05b# grep filp /proc/slabinfo
filp              234728 374100    256   15    1 : tunables  120   60    8 : 
slabdata  24940  24940    180
-bash-2.05b# grep filp /proc/slabinfo
filp              234724 374100    256   15    1 : tunables  120   60    8 : 
slabdata  24940  24940    174
So revert nr_files logic to a single integer would be enough, even for NUMA
int nr_pages_used_by_filp;
int nr_pages_filp_limit;
int filp_in_danger __read_mostly;
static void callback_pages_in_use_by_filp(int inc)
{
     int in_danger;
     nr_pages_used_by_filp += inc;
     in_danger = nr_pages_used_by_filp >= nr_pages_filp_limit;
     if (in_danger != filp_in_danger)
         filp_in_danger = in_danger;
}
struct file *get_empty_filp(void)
{
...
if (filp_in_danger && !capable(CAP_SYS_ADMIN))
	goto over;
...
}
void __init files_init(unsigned long mempages)
{
...
nr_pages_filp_limit = (mempages * 10) / 100; /* 10% for filp use */
...
}
