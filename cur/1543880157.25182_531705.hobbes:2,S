I'm a bit lost about what is currently done and who advocates for what.
It seems to me the MNT_ALLOWUSERMNT (or whatever :) flag should be
propagated.  In the /share rbind+chroot example, I assume the admin
would start by doing
	mount --bind /share /share
	mount --make-slave /share
	mount --bind -o allow_user_mounts /share (or whatever)
	mount --make-shared /share
then on login, pam does
	chroot /share/$USER
or some sort of
	mount --bind /share /home/$USER/root
	chroot /home/$USER/root
or whatever.  In any case, the user cannot make user mounts except under
/share, and any cloned namespaces will still allow user mounts.
Or are you guys talking about something else?
