I'm sorry about the confusion. I forgot the earlier thread. Please
disregard my earlier comments wrt. dynamism, as they appear to be in
conflict with other notions.
I think the __setup()'s should be moved to ipc/sem.c; otherwise I think
manfred's the right person to do the review here and I'll back off.
