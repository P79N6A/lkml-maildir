I would agree with this explanation.

Uh, the version he has can cope with this, see the following:

>    'lba32' extensions Copyright (C) 1999,2000 John Coffman
The lba32 extensions should take care of this, of course you have to add
'lba32' as a line in your lilo.conf before lilo actually uses them (and, I
assume, the BIOS must support the LBA extensions, but it seems most modern
ones do).
Give that a try.  Works for me.
Later,
Tom
