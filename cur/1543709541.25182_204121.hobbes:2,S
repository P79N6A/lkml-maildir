But, if I understand this right, now you can have either eth or serial.  If you 
have eth and hit a breakpoint prior to its int, you are dead.

I would rather standardize on the name of the INIT block.  How about something like:
#include <linux/kdgb_io.h>
:
:
struc kgdb_io_table kgdb_io_table[]=KGDB_IO_FUNCTIONS;
then in linux/kgdb_io.h we have:
#include <asm/kgdb_io.h>
struc kgdb_io_table {
	char (*kgdb_read_char);
     	void  (*kgdb_write_char);
         :
	:
}
And in asm/kgdb_io.h we define:
extern char my_read_char(void);
:
#define KGDB_IO_FUNCTIONS {{my_read_char, my_write_char,...},\
                             {eth_read_char,...}}
So it is completely up to the arch asm/kgdb_io.h to define the names and even 
how many.  We then assume that the first one is the default.  An arch that wants 
to mess with different things can do it all in this file, including having 
several diffent serial drivers all with the same entry points, different default 
as set at configure time and so on.
