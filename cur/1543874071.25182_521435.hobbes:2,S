actually, no, i found this web page:
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0606.0/0527.html
which refers to a number of related "PROVE" options.  what their
status is these days is not clear, but i'm just pointing out that
someone is testing the one above when it can't possibly be set
anywhere.
rday
p.s.  just FYI, i ran my "find dead CONFIG variables" script on the
entire tree and, as we speak, there are 316 preprocessor tests that
are testing variables of the form "CONFIG_whatever" for which that
option is not set anywhere in the tree.  (that is, 316 distinct
variables, not just 316 distinct tests.)  see the attached script and
feel free to run it from the top of the tree on your favourite
directory or sub-directory.
i'm not saying every one of those examples represents an error.  some
of those might be set in a makefile, etc.  but it's enlghtening to run
it anyway to see the output.
