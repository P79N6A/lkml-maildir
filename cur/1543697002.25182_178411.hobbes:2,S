Hi, thanks for your reply.

However I noticed that if I use 2.6.0-test9-mm1 or
mm2; the problem seems to be solved. With mm1, it even
starts Openoffice faster than 2.4.x (34 sec compared
with 46sec). The only problem with mm kernel is, the
vmware modules for 2.6 kernel I get from 
http://ftp.cvut.cz/vmware/
  causes OOPs. I experience
considerable performance improvd with mm kernel.
Hope finnally the performace tweak in mm kernel will
get merged and the author of vmware modules for 2.6
fixed the OOP.
