Here's an interesting trace I got today.  It looks either the emu10k1 or
USB irq handler left IRQ 10 disabled.  This isn't a tracer bug because
you can clearly see this leads to an xrun.  Since I've been hacking the
emu10k1 driver quite a bit, I suspect this is the problem.
This trace also shows that my trigger callback for the emu10k1
multichannel device needs optimizing; it takes 300 usecs to stop all 16
voices, not acceptable for an ALSA irq handler which uses SA_INTERRUPT.
I think I can improve this significantly by reordering the register
settings and eliminating some function call overhead.
