do_tcp_sendpages() should never get passed poffset+psize>PAGE_SIZE,
that would be a bug.
Feel free to add a BUG() check for that if you wish, and a fix for any
caller which violates this.
The code is perfectly fine as-is.  It was originally written to accept
page arrays, but once it was decided that ->sendpage() would only pass
in one page, we simply modified to caller of do_tcp_sendpages() to
accomodate this argument passing change, instead of changing
do_tcp_sendpages() which is totally unnecessary.
