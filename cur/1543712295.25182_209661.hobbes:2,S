Subject: PATCH: Minor fix to serial debug option in 2.4.25

I work for a PC/104 embedded hardware company and I'm trying to get IRQ 
sharing working for our serial boards and CPU boards with serial ports.
I'm having some trouble with set_multiport and discovered
SERIAL_DEBUG_INTR in serial.c as a helpful option.  When I enabled it I
found a bug in one of the debug statements.  I've attached a patch for
2.4.25 which fixes the bug.
I'm not on this list so please CC me if you have any questions or
comments.  Thanks.
