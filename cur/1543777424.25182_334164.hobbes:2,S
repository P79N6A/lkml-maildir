2.6.13-rc3 x86_64 failed, but 
2.6.13-rc2 x86_64 worked
And both of these revisions in the i386 kernel still work?

We're toast at this point, even before the EC message.
Looks like this failure was reported here
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4534
and is assigned to Luming.
Is it possible for you to test the latest ACPI patch?
http://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/lenb/acpi/patches/release/
2.6.13/
Also, it would be good to confirm the same failure exists with
CONFIG_ACPI_DEBUG=n.
thanks,
