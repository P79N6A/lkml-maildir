The same message got I am since I'm used recompiled version of crond :-)
Without any non-exec patch.

He prevented attack ONLY since attacker do not expected to find non-exec

It's what non-exec stack does for most daemons: he leave hole where it is
but make just one common (used now by 99.9% of attackers) way to exploit
it impossible. As far as attaker do not expect this papering it works.
But when/if it'll be incorporated inmainstream kernel attackers willjust
switch tools and this way will  no longer common anymore (exploit
developed to work around non-exec stack is harder to create and debug buy
it works with normal stack as well).

Exactly.

Formally speaking - no. Really - yes.

Non-exec stack protect you from executing code on stack but IF attacker
expect it it's not a good protection anymore (as Ts'o showed).

Attackers will change tools/cracks if it will be feasible. Clever attakers
can work around non-exec patch already but it's crackers population
minority by far. Most crackers are using cracks developed by others. As
far as non-exec systems are exotic it buys your some security (more or
less the same security as PowerPC/Sparc/etc buys your). When it's
mainstream it'll no longer work.

It's wrong analogy. Non-exec stack is more like movind key from under
carpet near door to your garden: key is STILL easily available (garden is
usually available exen if house is still locked :-) but most attackers do
not know about it. As far as most houseowners will do this attakers will
try to find key in the gardenas well.

So does mere recompilatio with unusual optimisation flags.

And published generic exploits to make crackers work easier :-) Then patch
was changed and sample exploits was changed as well - last Ts'os one look
great to me though...

Linus heard all rguments many times. Repeating them will not help you for
sure.

Most users do not care about other architectures. It's all about
benefits/price. This ration was not raised for last year (neither due
changes in patch not due new pro- arguments ) so why Linusshould change
his mind ?
