Nope.

Nope.

Surprise! It used the exact same mechanism.

No, but mixing them up in certain combinations was impossible exactly  
because they used the same mechanism, which could only store one path for  
each drive - so either the drive was a subst, or it was joined somewhere  
(or neither), but you couldn't have both.

So have I. Seriously weird programming in there. Also seriously  
inefficient programming.

That was true since 2.x, actually, and what they mutilated was Xenix. It  
was officially called "Xenix compatibility".
There is a persistent rumour that the "\" thing was because one of the  
developers simply got things wrong by accident.

I don't know, but I do know that NT 4 can arbitrarily reassign drive  
letters, sometimes even on the fly IIRC. Doing it for the system partition  
means you need serious registry hacking to fix all those paths, of course
