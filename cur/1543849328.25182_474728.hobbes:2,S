We started using VT only for 64 bit, then added 32 bit, then 16-bit 
protected, then vm86 and real mode.  We'd transfer the x86 state on each 
mode change, but it was (a) fragile (b) considered unclean.
You're right that "big real" mode is not supported, but so far that 
hasn't been a problem.  Do you know of an OS that needs big real mode?

Over time that emulator would grow as OSes and compilers evolve... and 
we'd really like to keep basic things like the apic in the kernel (as 
does Xen).

Do not meddle in the internals of kernels, for they are subtle and quick to panic.
