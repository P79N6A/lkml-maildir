Actually I compiled agpgart for my Intel 440?? motherboard into the kernel
instead of letting agpgart be a module.  Is that OK?

If I don't find your patch, then could I simply reconfigure the kernel so
that the modules must be recompiled every time the kernel is recompiled?
I believe that is equivalent to unsetting CONFIG_MODVERSIONS.  Anyway, I'll
try that and see what happens.
Thank you both for the quick response.
