That is what I heard as well.  However look at the topic of this
thread.  Documenting various level of stability is the same as saying
something isn't stable.  Which is the same as saying something is
going to break.  So if we are going to break things on purpose we
should break them all of the time so dependencies don't build up.  So
that it is almost impossible to use unstable interfaces.

I don't have a clue.

Agreed.
However history does show that most people get API design wrong, at
least the first time.
If we were good at getting it right sys_ioctl would not be a problem,
and quite possibly would never have come into being.
So the question is can we get good enough at review that we can live
with the few mistakes that make it through?
