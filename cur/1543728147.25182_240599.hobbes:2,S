Hi all,
Just a quick, hopefully unpartisan, reminder that people who are 
interested in getting things done rather than feeding trolls would 
probably feel a lot less stressed out if they moved on to other, 
possibly more constructive, things on their todo list than fanning the 
flames of this thread.

p.s. Not to say I haven't enjoyed reading it :-)
