Can you reproduce this and let me know exactly which errors the swapon
produces?  I just get a clean "ENODEV" back from swapon, which happens
when the blkdev_open happens in swapon.  Successful open of a
non-existant block device sounds more like a driver problem than
anything else.  Certainly, the read/write functions should never, ever
silently succeed while still leaving the page locked, but manually
unlocking the page in such a condition is definitely the wrong thing to
do (even freeing the page is bad news in this state), as the driver has
not yet disclaimed that page.
