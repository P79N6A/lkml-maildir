But why should we add features to the semaphores.  There's very little
users of those real semaphore semantics, and they could do with a generic,
all-C implementation because they are not important fast-pathes.  OTOH
we have lots of places needing plain mutex semantics, that are important
fastpathes.  Let's optimize for the common case instead of the corner
case.
