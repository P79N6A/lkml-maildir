Hi,
I am using libpcap 0.6 on Linux to capture packets from the interface.
In my application I am using pcap_setfilter to modify the filter
for capturing packets from the interface.
But after filter has been modified the libpcap retains the packets
that libpcap had got using the old filter (ie before pcap_setfilter
is called)
This filtering is done using a socket. So in pcap_setfilter is there
any way we can "dump" all the 'unread' packets captured using the old
filter which are present in the socket's buffer ?
thanks a lot
Ashley
