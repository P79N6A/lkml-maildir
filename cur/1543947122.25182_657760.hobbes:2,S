Agreed. The fact I'm having to fix bugs introduced by incorrect printk
wrapping confirms that for printk strings at least it is overzealous.
I'm all for it complaining about
  printk(KERN_FOO "<90 chars>", foo, bar + 37);
type bits when the foo, bar should be underneath to be visible but for
straight quoted text too long it should not warn and try to get the text
folded.
