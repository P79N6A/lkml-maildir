Devfs handles it both ways. In the former case, a device driver
registers device entries with devfs. So that can happen in response to
a device plug/unplug event, and doesn't even need interaction from
user space.
In the latter case, an attempt to access a device node for which there
is no loaded driver (and thus no entry in devfs) generates a module
load. That module load will in turn result in the appropriate device
entry being registered and magically appearing. So it all just works.
