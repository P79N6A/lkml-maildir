I'd say one of the non-cleanup versions for -stable
(but I've not compared them to see which one is better).
I'm still working my way through all the ->mmap methods to check
their safety with regard to yesterday's change (there are about
ten times as many as the last time I looked).  So far there's only
one driver mmap I want to go back and recheck, the vast majority
are as good today as they were the day before, but ...
... what I think you have done is break the vma merging on
ordinary files: because of that irritating VM_CAN_NONLINEAR
flag which generic_file_mmap() and some others add in.
To break the merging won't cause anyone much trouble,
but is a slight regression we should fix.
I'd have been very upset not to find something ;)
