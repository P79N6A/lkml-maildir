OSF used to have a number of papers available on the porting of both OSF/1
and Linux to Mach.
Now, since there have been one or two other Microkernel ports of Linux (L4
comes to mind), a better direction might be to make a generic
'microkernel' arch, of which OSFMach (and maybe GNUMach) would be
specific arches.
I'm speculating at the moment, but it might be a good idea to have a
'mk-vm' directory to replace all of the normal memory management code,
since it would otherwise tend to drown in #ifdef's

I've thought about this, and would probably do it if I could get (a newer) 
MkLinux to run on Intel boxes..
