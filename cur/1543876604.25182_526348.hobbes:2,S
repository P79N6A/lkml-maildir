yes. Part of the problem is that the forcedeth.c driver does not fully 
support NAPI - today i've implemented those bits (see them below), based 
on your testcase. The other part is that the Intel NIC uses MSI, while 
foredeth uses fasteoi, correct? [you can see this in /proc/interrupts]
there are a few other things i'm working on to improve this. I've 
uploaded -rt9 which is the current state of affairs. Note that using 
-rt9 you'll likely only see IRQ-8406 overhead in the system, because 
i've added an optimization to do process the softirq-net-tx workload in 
the hardirq thread if the priority of the two is the same (which is the 
default behavior). But -rt9 is still work in progress that is not fully 
finished yet: in some cases i'm seeing 'fluctuating performance' 
problems on forcedeth that werent there before.

Subject: [patch] forcedeth.c: improve NAPI handler
another forcedeth.c thing: i noticed that its NAPI handler does not do 
tx-ring processing. The patch below implements this - tested on 
DESC_VER_2 hardware, with CONFIG_FORCEDETH_NAPI=y.
