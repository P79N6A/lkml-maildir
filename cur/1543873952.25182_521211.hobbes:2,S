 	Hello All ,  I am have been having this problem since I purchased the 
controller and after changing out the disks I thought were the problem .
 	I am still getting the continous :
mptscsih: ioc1: attempting task abort! (sc=f7a64500)
scsi 3:0:4:0:
         command: Inquiry: 12 00 00 00 60 00
mptbase: Initiating ioc1 recovery
mptscsih: ioc1: task abort: SUCCESS (sc=f7a64500)
  target3:0:4: Domain Validation detected failure, dropping back
  target3:0:4: Domain Validation skipping write tests
  target3:0:4: Ending Domain Validation
  target3:0:4: asynchronous
  target3:0:5: Beginning Domain Validation
mptscsih: ioc0: attempting target reset! (sc=f7a64380)
 	The acutual device id's change and the driver continously resets the 
busses & starts all over .
 	The disks are in a HP DS-SL13R-BA 4354R 14drive ultra3 racKmount cabinet 
w/ dualbus & dualps ,  Which seems to present a ID6 ,  That does not show up in 
any of the bus scans .
 	Now I have previously had the same cabinet with 18gb disks which had the 
same problem with this controller .  BUT I also have a LSI Logic / Symbios 
Logic 53c1010 66MHz Ultra3 dual SCSI bus Adapter which works flawlessly with the 
18gb disks in this very same cabinet .
 	The cables for connecting the adapter(s) to tha cabinet are less than 24 
inches in length .
 	Would anyone please shed some light on what it is I am doing wrong or 
need to do or ....?  Too have this controller recognise these disk drives in 
this cabinet .
Here is the WHOLE enchalada .  Too big to put on the list so I posted them to my webpage .
