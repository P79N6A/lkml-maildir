My mobo is a Biostar M7VIB, VIA 82686 chipset.
It appears that thre doesn't seem to be a way to force a floppy format 
at non 512 byte sectors, as in I need to do a 256 byte, 18 sectors 
per track on a  DS 360k disk.  fdutils, fdformat, and a format from 
the emulator itself all fail to write a correct disk, insisting on a 
9 sector per track PC format.
Ideas, including bigger hammer at this point, cheerfully discussed.
