Subject: Spinlock Related Debug Messages in Block Driver

Dear All,
I implemented the sample block driver for the removable devices and
the code contains no statements related to the spin lock except a lock
to the blk_init_queue API as shown below.
spinlock_t qlock;
gDisk->blkqueue = blk_init_queue(do_my_request, &gDisk->qlock);
The kernel version is 2.6.10.
Everything works fine but when I try to copy a file of huge size
(about 100MB), the following debug messages are getting displayed on
the console:
Fc3: drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c: 2351: spin_lock already locked by the drivers.
Fc3: drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c: 2468: spin_unlock not locked by the drivers.
In spite of these debug messages; the file is getting copied successfully.
I studied the Block driver 16th chapter in LDD third edition.
Can any one provide a pointer to these debug messages. Do I need to
implement any patches for the kernel.
Regards,
Srinivas G.
