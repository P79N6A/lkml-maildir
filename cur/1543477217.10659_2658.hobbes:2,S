Linux Kernel List,
Earlier today, it was brought to my attention that we sent out an invite for the LinuxWorld Greenhouse to linux-kernel@vger.rutgers.edu.  Obviously, this is not an appropriate use of the list -- nor was it our intention to do this.
We've taken a great deal of effort to only post to lists after talking to listmom's, or posting to newsgroups after talking to moderators.  Unfortunately, despite efforts to the contrary, the linux-kernel@vger.rutgers.edu email got on this list.
You should know that we (Xplain) don't make commissions on selling stations in the LinuxWorld Greenhouse -- and that the Greenhouse is IDG's way of helping out the grassroots community be at the show.  So, good intentions -- not commercial efforts -- are the focus here.
In any event, we apologize for posting to the list -- it was not intended, nor was it appropriate.
Sincerely,
Neil Ticktin
CEO, Xplain Corporation
