Subject: PATCH: scsi_scan.c: emulate windows behavior
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

I would have sworn we already patched this, but now I can find no record of
it.
Attached is a one-liner patch to scsi_scan.c, which changes the length of
the INQUIRY data request from 255 bytes to 36 bytes.  This subtle change
makes Linux act more like Win/MacOS and other popular OSes, and reduces
incompatibility with a broad range of out-of-spec devices that will simply
die if asked for more than the required minimum of 36 bytes.
Did we patch this before?  I can't find it in the l-k archives, but I'm
almost positive we have.  I remeber this because this problem plagues some
USB devices, which just crash if you ask for more than 36 bytes of data.
Patch is attached.  Please apply.
Matt
