And there are no good reasosns why the rules should be different for i386
and powerpc.
This type of special casing is always bad.
Think about it a little.
Someone writes a generic driver and test it on i386 - OK.
But for powerpc it result in a build failure. It would be so much better
to warn about this situation early.
We had this exact issue in loop.c recently - so it is not a made up example.
[I recall it was ia64 that had a build failure but the example still holds ture]
