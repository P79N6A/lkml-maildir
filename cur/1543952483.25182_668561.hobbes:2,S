Hi,
while transforming some code with big allocations (like 120 KB) from 
kmalloc to vmalloc — virtual contiguity is sufficient — I hit a
BUG_ON in mm/vmalloc.c a number of times:
	void vfree(const void *addr)
	{
	        BUG_ON(in_interrupt());
	        __vunmap(addr, 1);
	}
First I was thinking “how could iptables -F run in interrupt context?”,
but apparently, it does seem to make a difference:
	...
	spin_lock_bh(&a_local_spinlock);
	list_del_rcu(&node->list);
	printk(KERN_INFO "Interrupt? %lu\n", in_interrupt());
	/* vfree not worky here */
	spin_unlock_bh(&a_local_spinlock);
	printk(KERN_INFO "Interrupt? %lu\n", in_interrupt());
	/* now possible */
	vfree(node);
	...
and this gives (x86_32)
	Interrupt? 256
	Interrupt? 0
So this may be a "property" of spinlocks, but it is a bit strange to me.
Why should not I be able to call vfree() when I am, in fact, in
user context (but with a bh spinlock held...).
Do I perhaps need a non-bh spinlock? There's RCU going on on that 
linked list so I am not sure whether I could just call the normal 
spin_lock() function.
Looking at the code of _spin_lock_bh in kernel/spinlock.c reveals that 
it is actually disabling preempt instead of being in an interrupt. 
Making an uneducated guess, would
	BUG_ON(in_interrupt() != 0 && in_interrupt() != 256)
in vfree() be safe?
thanks,
Jan
