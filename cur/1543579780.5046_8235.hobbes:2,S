Which unfortunately provides only some pieces of information Michael wants
to gather. SCT's sard patches give you much improved statistics that
should basically do what you want. I'm not sure of the current location of
the sard patches but as RedHat puts sard in its kernel, it should be
available somewhere on redhat.com, I suppose. Check out the sysstat
package for userlevel tools. Earlier versions of sard can be found at
ftp.uk.linux.org/pub/linux/sct/fs/profiling/
