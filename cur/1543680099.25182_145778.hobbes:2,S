Hello Chris,
I have to correct myself regarding the problem. It does _not_ arise on
aic-driven scsi-disk, but on 3ware-driven RAID5 with 320 GB data. I tried to
mount it by hand, but that does not work either. It does not look like there is
a lot of work going on on the hds while mounting (no LEDs). 
Can anyone reproduce with equal setup?
I try to come up with further information...

Stephan
