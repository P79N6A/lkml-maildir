The character I/O part of bonnie++ writes a single character at a time,
via stdio.  It's more a test of your C library than of the kernel.
The fact that you get the same throughput on each platform with
the block I/O part of the test indicates that the hardware and
kernel are OK, but the C library is broken.
Not sure how to diagnose this.  Probably you should write a
simple five-line stdio-based test program, see if that exhibits
the same behaviour, then fiddle with setvbuf().
