I have those 2 cards (aha-2940uw and es1373) in my alpha.
The es1373 card works for a few seconds and then starts repeating the same
second over and over.  After a few times of attempting to play any sounds,
it quits working until the system is reset.
The aha-2940uw seems to work until I actually send any data out.  I have 6
2gb disks on it and I attempted to mke2fs on a raid0 across all 6 disks.

I'm not sure what other information I need to give.
I would have posted to linux-alpha, but there doesn't seem to be one.  I
posted to sound-list@redhat.com (or something like that) and have not
received a responce yet.
