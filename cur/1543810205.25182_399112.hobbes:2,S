well, I'm neither for nor against a separate syscall
here, don't get me wrong, but it will take ages to
get the 'new' syscalls added to all archs, and the
arch maintainers will probably have a dozent reasons
why this particular syscall is completely wrong :)

well, they would see exactly the same as before, not
more and not less, new features will require new tools
and/or adaptations to the old ones. period.

does that change what it is, a backdoor circumventing
established security? I don't think so ...
