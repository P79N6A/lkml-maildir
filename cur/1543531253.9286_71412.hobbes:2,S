True, except that we're not discussing interrupt latency time
here. We're discussing the time between a task being marked as
runnable, and the time that it actually starts running (with the
presumption that its marked SCHED_FIFO, and is thus entitled to run
immediately). Obviously, poor interrupt latencies will lead to bad
scheduling jitter. But we actually have pretty reasonable and
consistent interrupt latencies, plus some bugs that lead to bad
scheduling jitter.
