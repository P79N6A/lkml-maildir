Let me be the first to say "Thank you Ingo! (and Arjan)".  God, the fun
I had with _?_?smp_processor_id. The first time I got the bug message I
was "WTF", and then to figure out if I should use the _ or __ version.
I hope your patch gets in so that this will be much cleared up, and put
my effort in learning the difference between them all in vain.
I guess I should download the latest kernel and try it out.
Thanks again,
