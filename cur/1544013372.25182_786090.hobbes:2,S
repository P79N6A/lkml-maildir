How about this?

Subject: [PATCH] tty: recompute minimum every wakeup
Impact: corner case bugfix
Generally, tty can be controled by multiple process at the same time.
But unfortunately, linux tty doesn't consider another process might have changed
tty attribute when own process is sleeping.
if following bad scenario happend, tty line discipline can't handle ^D.
reproduce way
=================
1. run tty_test.sh (see below)
2. input any key after "raw" is displayed
3. wait until "cooked" is displayed
4. input ^D  (oops, it's ignored. you can't exit from "cat")
tty_test.sh
--------------
#!/bin/sh
exec 3<&0
cat <&3 &
pid=$!
stty -icanon
echo raw
sleep 3
stty icanon
echo cooked
wait $pid
