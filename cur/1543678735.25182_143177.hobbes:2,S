I use fbi to view pictures on the framebuffer. I've been using 2.4.17 for
a very long time, and I haven't noticed this problem with 2.4.20 and 2.5.70
I have a Compaq Armada M700 laptop, with an ATI Rage Mobility videocard.
Years ago I tried the ATI framebuffer things in the kernel, without much
success, so I've been using the vesa framebuffer ever since.
With 2.4.21 the effect is this: I start fbi with some picture, the panel
goes white in a its-not-working fashion (so not the same as viewing an all
white picture), and my computer stops responding. Cannot be pinged,
keyboard doesn't work any more.
Switch off.
Gee
