I'd venture to say that anything using multiple pid namespaces should be
mounting its own private /var/run subtree (and similar for other such
directories). Consider it as similar to the problem of colliding PIDs on
multiple physical hosts, or on a host and a pile of UMLs it's running:
the solution there, too, is to unshare /var/run (by not NFS-exporting it
in the latter two cases, by private mounts in the former).
(Isn't this PID namespace stuff meant for chroots anyway?)
