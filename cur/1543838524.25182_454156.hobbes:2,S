Of course setuid still works, so it doesn't need to be done all at once.

But since file capabilities cannot survive an exec, analysis with a gui
which walks the fs could be pretty simple.

Very good point.  Preventing communication channels i.e. through signals
isn't a concern, but user hallyn ptracing himself running /bin/passwd
