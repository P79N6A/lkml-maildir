I have started to write some kernel modules for fun now, but they are a
bit empty :)
it's just some printk's and some other simple things.
I wonder if there are any good howtoes out on the Net somewhere, I've
read a bit on: 
http://tldp.org/LDP/lkmpg,
 but I'm afraid it's a bit
outdated(?)
I'm only doing this for fun(at this time, maybe it becomes serious
when i become a bit older;) ) so i don't want to spend any
money on a book, or on an course.
Best regards
