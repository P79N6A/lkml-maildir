Prior to the __page_alloc hang, the loadavg shoots way up, so something 
is spinning, but it is hard to tell what.  This has persisted for as 
long as 8-10 minutes on one hang, although it is usually shorter (1-2 
minutes).  One of my concerns is that the e1000 issue might only be a 
symptom of the page tables getting clobbered by something else.  I have 
been trying to get the system to hang during more "controlled" usage, 
but have been unable to.  I have even run tsl (telnet scripting 
language) scripts to logon 250 processes and beat the CPU and disk up, 
creating and destroying processes along the way.  I was able to drive 
loadavg > 50 and LowFree to < 5000K, but could never create a hang.  I 
suspect that I might need truely "random" inbound traffic to find the 
bug (but this is a guess).
In terms of network traffic, the system is busy, but not obnoxiously so. 
  The load on the server is primarily terminal traffic from about 200 
"real humans", so there are a lot of small, random packets.  In terms of 
network bandwidth, it is not all that bad, maybe 2-3 megabits (a guess). 
  The arp table is reasonably big (> 200 entries) but this is not that 
bad either.  I have not looked for arp storms or other network anomolies 
on the LAN.  The system is on a local LAN and gets no internet traffic.
I am unfamiliar with NAPI, so I have not tried it.
On another topic, I am trying to build a 2.4.26 kernel that reserves 
more LowFree.  The mm/page_alloc.c file describes a boot parameter 
called "lower_zone_reserve" that should tune this.  Unfortunately, this 
parameter seems to be read after the zone tables are initialized (which 
is probably a bug).
