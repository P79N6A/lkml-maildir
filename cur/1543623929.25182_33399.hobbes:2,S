If you could setup a public arch repository of the 2.4 / 2.5
kernel of which everybody can copy/clone their arch kernel
repository, that would be a good start.
Even better would be an arch kernel repository that is kept
up-to-date (automatically?) or gated from the bitkeeper tree.
That would give us some real way to compare the two tools.

Rik
