Yes, it is almost compatible with the "old" hotplug. On modern setups
it is just one udev rule to catch the right event. On older setups a
simple symlink should work, yes.

The easiest would be to leave the "device"-link in its current state:
  mouse0 -> ../../../devices/...
and correct that later by getting completely rid of _all_ "device" links
with the move of the device object to /sys/devices/ (the DEVPATH for
"mouse0" will then contain the _complete_ hierarchy including "input0").
Current userspace is not aware to follow two "device" links. Should not be
hard to implement, but seems not really worth the effort, if we plan to
rearrange it to a global device tree anyway.
Thanks,
Kay
