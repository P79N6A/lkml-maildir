If above.net has servers that are open then above.net should be the one
affected.  Blackisting ALL ADDRESS SPACE associated with above.net isn't the
right way.  Let's say the address space in UK is provided for by above.net.
It now affects your mail personally although the UK itself may have
absolutely no open relays and all mail servers in the UK are listed as
'good' in the ORBS db.
Global blacklisting like this isn't the right way to get things fixed. 
Human nature is going to target ORBS, not above.net.

Consider it insiduous, just like many forms of marketing.  "We're good, use
us" and the we unknowingly begins blocking a significant portion of the
community.  I.e. vger is dropping a good lot of email from perfectly valid
users of the vger lists.
