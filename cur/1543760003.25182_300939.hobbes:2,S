I do agree with you, Andreas and other ppl on that this is expected
behavior on ext2, and ext3 should be chosen over ext2 when such
corruptions are under consideration.
However, mount -o sync won't fix the problem for ext2 either :)  I sent a
report last week about that ext2 doesn't actually sync writes even if an
ext2 partition is mounted -o sync,dirsync.  Andrew confirmed that ext2 has
MS_SYNCHONOUS holes (and possibly O_SYNC holes).
