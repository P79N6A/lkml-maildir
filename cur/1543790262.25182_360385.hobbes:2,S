Subject: [rfc] x86_64: Kconfig changes for NUMA
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/10/26/17

On x86_64 arches, there is no way to choose ACPI_NUMA without having to choose
K8_NUMA.  CONFIG_K8_NUMA is not needed for Intel EM64T NUMA boxes.  It also 
looks odd if you have to select ACPI_NUMA from the power management menu.  
This patch fixes those oddities.  Patch does the following:
1. Makes NUMA a config option like other arches
2. Makes topology detection options like K8_NUMA dependent on NUMA
3. Choosing ACPI NUMA detection can be done from the standard 
   "Processor type and features" menu
Comments?
Thanks,
Kiran
