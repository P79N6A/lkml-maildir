This is qgit-1.5
With qgit you will be able to browse revision histories, view patch content
and changed files, graphically following different development branches.
FEATURES
 - View revisions, diffs, files history, files annotation, archive tree.
 - Commit changes visually cherry picking modified files.
 - Apply or format patch series from selected commits, drag and
   drop commits between two instances of qgit.
 - Associate commands sequences, scripts and anything else executable
   to a custom action. Actions can be run from menu and corresponding
   output is grabbed by a terminal window.
 - qgit implements a GUI for the most common StGIT commands like push/pop
   and apply/format patches. You can also create new patches or refresh
   current top one using the same semantics of git commit, i.e. cherry
   picking single modified files.
NEW IN THIS RELEASE
Multi tab support and source highlighter are the cool new features.
Multi tab allows the user to open many patch or file view tabs, each
linked on a different revision.
If GNU Source-highlight (
http://www.gnu.org/software/src-highlite/
) is
installed and in PATH then it is possible to toggle source code highlight
pressing the Color text tool button in file viewer. Please refer to
Source-highlight site for the list of supported languages and additional
documentation.
Some bugs squashed too. Not a lot though...qgit-1.4 has been a
very stable release ;-)
Finally, some performance tweaking.
Please note that you will need git 1.4.0 or newer.
