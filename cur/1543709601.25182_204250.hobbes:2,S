Hi,
This sounds like memory corruption (which could be caused by a misbehaving
driver or by flaky hardware) because transaction->t_ilist is not used at
all by the kernel code. Did this box run stable with other kernels?
I found a similar report from Michelle (CCed), which can be found at:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=107529754608448&w=2
Searching a bit more, I found another message from Michelle with 
topic "[SOLVED] Kernel-Bug (at checkpoint.c 587)"
http://lists.debian.org/debian-user-german/2004/debian-user-german-200401/msg04404.html
Unfortunately the said message is in German, which I can't understand. 
Michelle, can you clarify it for me?
Stephen, Andrew, any idea how can transaction->t_ilist become not NULL?

One more thing - it has happened when /var got full.
