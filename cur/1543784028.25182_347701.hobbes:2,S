Thanks for all the tips, guys.
I managed to get the problem to occur on a vanilla kernel with just the 
proprietary module loaded.  Contacted the vendor, they got me to try out 
a new driver, problem appears to be fixed.
Looks like the module wasn't properly tracking refcounts, so it was 
being unloaded when there were still dangling references.  Oops.
Thanks,
Chris
