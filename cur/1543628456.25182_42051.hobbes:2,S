Subject: [ANNOUNCE] Novell Zenworks for Linux 2.5.8 Patch Posted
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

A patch that supports Novell Zenworks on Linux kernel 2.5.8 has
been posted to:
ftp.timpanogas.org:/zenworks/zfdimgkrnlpatch-2.5.8.tar.gz 
ftp.utah-nac.org:/zenworks/zfdimgkrnlpatch-2.5.8.tar.gz 
This patch has some limitations since the AHA142X, AHA1740, etc.
drivers do not compile properly in the 2.5.8 kernel at present.
The struct scatterlist {} has changed, so this release is 
experimental until these drivers are functioning and build
correctly in the main tree.
