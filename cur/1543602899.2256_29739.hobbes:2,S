thanks - the patch looks mostly correct.

we need a single schedule to migrate the CPU to the right CPU. Btw, it's
not a big offense to run on the wrong CPU: do_softirq() will run
correctly. But there wont be a ksoftirqd exeuting on the 'right' CPU (for
this short amount of time until it schedules once), and we might miss a
single instance of softirq processing. So it's cleaner to do a schedule()
that guarantees that we migrate to the target CPU.

well, this basically reverts it to the original code and removes the
optimization - but i dont have any strong feelings in either way. I think
Andrea is right and it's more correct to set it TASK_RUNNING, for
task-statistics reasons. Reverted it to the old code.
and in fact while doing that i found another bug in the old code:
TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE was set in a non-IRQ-atomic way, so theoretically it
could be possible that the compiler reorders the setting of
TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE and the test for softirq_pending(), and if an IRQ gets
inbetween the we could miss processing softirq for 1/HZ again. Added an
optimization barrier(). (SMP-consistency is not needed, since we are
per-CPU.)
