Thanks for the sighting, Knut!
This regression is dramatic when put in the terms of 50% performance hit!
I guess the good news is that thermal throttling is doing the job
we are asking it to:-)
The statement above regarding the existence of active trip points
and the kernel not being able to control the fan are inconsistent
with each other.
Please open a sighting for this machine here:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=ACPI
vs. Power-Thermal
and attach the output from acpidump, cat /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/*/*
and assign it to len.brown@intel.com
BTW. does the board boot and run properly with "acpi=off"?
thanks,
-Len
