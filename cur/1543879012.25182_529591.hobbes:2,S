the bug has turned into an 'interface hang under high load' (i.e. the 
hack patch above is not necessary, but the problem is still there). It 
still affects the latest forcedeth.c in -rc6. I.e. it's still an 
unresolved regression. The last state i'm aware of is that I have sent 
Ayaz ethtool output as well of the hang, as requested.
