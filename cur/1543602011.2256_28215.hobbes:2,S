Hi,
We have a new kid on the block since we started thinking of a preemptive 
kernel.
ksoftirqd...
Running with nice 19 (shouldn't it really be -19?)
Or have a RT setting? (maybe not since one of the reasons for
softirqd would be lost - would be scheduled in immediately)
Can't a high prio or RT process be starved due to missing
service (bh) after an interrupt?
This will not show up in latency profiling patches since
the kernel does what is requested...
Previously it was run directly after interrupt,
before returning to the interrupted process...
