Here is the latest revision of some patches that have been bouncing
around linux-pci for a while.  linux-kernel is copied to get a few more
eyes on the ARCH_SUPPORTS_MSI change.  To my knowledge these patches
have not yet been queued into a maintainer tree.
Dan Williams (2):
      msi: introduce ARCH_SUPPORTS_MSI Kconfig option (rev2)
      msi: fix ARM compile
Daniel Wolstenholme (1):
      iop13xx: msi support (rev6)
