I think we should rebuffer so that we don't fail writes and reads that
other systems can do.
However, I am not so optimistic about the users aligning the buffers.
According to the info, glibc aligns at 8 bytes or 16 bytes (64 bit
architectures). I made st fail writes if the test
#define ST_DIO_ALIGN_OK(x) \
  (((unsigned long)(x) & (L1_CACHE_BYTES - 1)) == 0)
fails on the buffer address. With a P4 kernel the result was that tar to
tape failed ;-(
A solution would be to define the address test for user buffers based on
the configuration, for example:
#if defined(CONFIG_XXX)
#define ST_DIO_ALIGN_OK(x) \
  (((unsigned long)(x) & (L1_CACHE_BYTES - 1)) == 0)
#elif defined(CONFIG_YYY)
#define ST_DIO_ALIGN_OK(x) \
  (((unsigned long)(x) & 7) == 0)
#else
#define ST_DIO_ALIGN_OK(x) (1)
#endif
Of course, it would be better if this would be defined in a more general
place than st.c (some scsi header, dma-mapping.h, ... ?).
