Should be fine.  And the fact that OSS emulation is broken kind of rules
out the alsa-lib problem.
This does not sound like any problem we know about.  Are you sure the
hardware is still OK?  Do any of the channels work (try "speaker-test -D
surround51 --channels 6" while plugging your speakers into front, read,
center/lfe jacks).
Any chance of trying it in another machine?
