Alpha DP264, gcc 3.0.1 compiled.
After some testing and some work, got:
kernel: invalidate: busy buffer
Right after dismounting an ext2 diskette.
Attempting to remount the diskette resulted in:
kernel: kernel BUG at ll_rw_blk.c:660!
kernel: mount(1238): Kernel Bug 1
kernel: pc = [__make_request+2352/2368]  ra = [__make_request+2340/2368]  ps = 0000    Not tainted
Note that I got this once under 2.4.12 also.
I don't have time to run ksymoops right now.
The one from 2.4.12 was:
kernel: kernel BUG at buffer.c:664!
kernel: mdir(27124): Kernel Bug 1
kernel: pc = [invalidate_bdev+448/464]  ra = [invalidate_bdev+436/464]  ps = 0000    Not tainted
