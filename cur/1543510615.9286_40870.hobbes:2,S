I'd love this. The other thing that I'd love is some more
documentation on API changes. Moving my filesystem code from 2.2.3 to
2.2.12 was annoying because I had to spend a while searching mailing
list archives to figure out why the VFS and dcache interface changes
happened and whether I'd have to do anything tricky to make my code
work. Sure, I could have spent a lot of time reading everything on
linux-kernel and taking careful notes of everything that might be
relevant, but I'd really rather spend my time actually writing code.
If a change is important enough to require changing an interface in a
release cycle, it's also important enough to document what changed,
why, and how to update old code.
