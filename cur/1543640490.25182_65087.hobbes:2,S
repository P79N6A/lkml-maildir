I'm getting the exact same symptoms, although our systems are somewhat
different (still the VIA vt8233A southbridge, though):
Intel Pentium 4 2000Mhz (Northwood core) 
Soltek SL-85DRV3 motherboard w. VIA P4X266A chipset 
Nvidia GeForce 2 GTS and SB Live
256MB DDR RAM 
Kernel 2.4.19 w. XFS and pre-empt patches + Alsa 0.9 modules
I tried disabling both audio-support, rtc-driver and apm, but the
lockup's still occur.
PS. Pleace cc me, as I'm not on the list.
