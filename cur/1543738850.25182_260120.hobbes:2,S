Duh, I didn't finish the sentence. I meant this method above is nasty
filled with pipeline stalls. Don't know if that's what were saying, but
non-preemptable critical sections denoted by preempt_count must have some
kind of conceptual overlap with local_irq* functions. I use to curse the
seperation of the two since it made my own conception irregular, but I
have come to the conclusion that using relatively something light weight
like preempt_count() for that functionality instead. That's what I
meant. :)
