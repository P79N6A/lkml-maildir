Actually, there is; read my post earlier in this thread:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=111598859708620&w=2
To elaborate on the "check dmesg" part of that e-mail:
After you reboot with "maxcpus=2" (or however many physical CPU's you
have), you need to make sure you have messages like this, which indicate
that it really worked:
WARNING: No sibling found for CPU 0.
WARNING: No sibling found for CPU 1.
(and so on, if you have more than 2 CPU's)
