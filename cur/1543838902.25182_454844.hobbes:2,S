The only way I can see this would happen is if the BMC is misbehaving
somehow, like leaving the "ready" bit set for a long time (not clearing
it when it is supposed to) and always signalling that there is some
event ready.  I guess if the BMC was so fast that it was alway ready
that could cause this problem, but that doesn't really seem very likely
as userland would have to run to feed it to do that.
This is apparently a Fujitsu device, right?  The fact that the product
id is 0x0000 leads me to believe that this device is not completely
cooked yet.
