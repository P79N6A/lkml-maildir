It seems reproducible, but I'm not sure yet.  I first saw it (it being
D-state processes similar to what I see now; I didn't have sysrq
compiled into the kernel then) happen when I upgraded to -ac2; at the
time, I was using reiserfs on that partition instead of ext3.  I thought
it might be a reiser bug, so I converted it to ext3, and upgraded to -ac3. 
The conversion required a lot of LVM util running; I don't remember how
much time lapsed between finishing the conversion, and processes
hanging.
This leads me to believe it's not ext3, but either lvm or pdc202xx.  Or
something common to ext3(jbd)/reiserfs..
