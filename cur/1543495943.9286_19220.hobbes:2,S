->Network: SCSI over IP
And that brings me to interesting question. Would that be technically
possible to implement IP-over-EIDE ? I figure many cheap-but-good motherboards
come with inbuild EIDE controller, but no Ethernet. Would I want make 
clustering, it would be quite easy to connect those motherboards via
EIDE cables.

"Use the Source, Luke." ? :-)
->MM: Dynamic using off free disk space for swapping
BTW: If we ever decide to put this feature in kernel, I belive it should
be disabled by default.
BTW2: It should not be that hard to implement it in user space. You could
have daemon watching for free space and if it gets low, then it could
create new 128mb swapfile and activate it, and so on.... It is not clear
to me though wheter you would be able later to reclaim that space back..
