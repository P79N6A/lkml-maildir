Except that when the motherboard driver claims a device, it really
should claim all the resources used by the device.  It currently only
claims I/O port resources, but I think it should also claim MMIO
resources.  Otherwise, the system resource accounting is screwed up,
and resources consumed by the motherboard device could be mistakenly
allocated to another device.

Ok, this is starting to make sense.  It sounds like your memory
device has _HID of PNP0C80 and _CID of PNP0C01 (or PNP0C02).
The current ACPI driver binding algorithm in acpi_bus_find_driver()
looks at each driver, checking whether it can match either the _HID
or the _CID of a device.  Since we try the motherboard driver first,
it matches the memory device _CID.
I couldn't find a specific reference in the spec, but this seems
intuitively sub-optimal.  It seems like it'd be better to look
first for a driver that can claim the _HID (which is more specific),
and only fall back to checking the _CIDs if no _HID-specific driver
is found.
This looks fairly easy to do in ACPI.  Not so easy in PNPACPI,
since I don't think PNP has the concept of _HID vs _CID.  Maybe
Len will chime in with an opinion.
