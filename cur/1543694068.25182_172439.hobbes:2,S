Perhaps we should tell people to first write to the bad block, and only 
if the block remains bad after triggering the remapping by writing to it 
should you make any effort to get the filesystem to remap it for you.  
What do you think?
Rogier has not indicated that he has tried writing to the bad sector, 
has he?
