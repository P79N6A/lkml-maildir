Subject: net drivers depending on OBSOLETE

The following two net drivers depend in both 2.4 and 2.6 on OBSOLETE:
- FMV18X
- SEEQ8005
- SK_G16
Since CONFIG_OBSOLETE is never set they are not selectable.
Is there any reason why they should stay in the kernel or would you
accept a patch that removes these drivers?
More than one year ago, Alan Cox answered to the same question in two 
emails:

... sk_g16 is a pretty rare bit of
hardware but I thought people had it working in current 2.4, fmv18x
I've no idea about. I'll take a look at them
<--  next mail  -->
[FMV18X] Seems to be a mirror of the at1700 driver. Does anyone know if 
both do the same hardware ?

Could anyone comment on the current state of these drivers?
TIA
