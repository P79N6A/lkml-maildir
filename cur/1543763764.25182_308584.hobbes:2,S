Hi Piotr,
Good way to make kprobes useful, but I have some comments.

why /proc ?
You can use a combination of SysRq key to enter a kprobe command line prompt.
Initially you can define a dummy breakpoint for command line prompt and accept
commands from thereon.
Later display the list of features add/remove/display breakpoint, backtrace etc.
Also once you hit a breakpoint you give a command line prompt and user can backtrace/ dump some global memory, dump registers etc.
Let me know if you need more information.
Thanks
Prasanna
