Yes, we have private mappings per CPU.  I don't think that is as 
feasible on Xen, since it requires the hypervisor to support a per-CPU 
PD shadow for each root.  But alternative implementations are possible 
using segmentation.  The primary advantage is that you don't need to 
call back from the interface layer to disable preemption for per-CPU 
data access.
It turns out to be really easy if you add the loadsegment / savesegment 
macros to the VMI interface, and require the kernel to abstain from 
using, say, the GS segment.  I think this is the path we are going down 
for the VMI on Xen 3 port.

Yes, lets focus on finding the right interface for now - and just leave 
the door open a bit for the future.
