It actually "just works".  We have a 16GB machine that gets a lot of
filesystem activity and use a 2:2 split all the time.  Appended patch is
all that we need.
It was for other reasons at the time, but I think we fixed a bunch of
the multiple kernel mapping PMDs back in 2.5.  Some remnants of that
stuff are still around.
