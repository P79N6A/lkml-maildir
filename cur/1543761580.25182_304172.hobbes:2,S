Subject: [patch 01/10] char/ds1620: use msleep() instead of schedule_timeout()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Not sure why any driver needs to sleep for *two* ticks, so let's fix it.
Use msleep() instead of schedule_timeout() to guarantee the
task delays as expected. Signals are never checked for by the callers or
in the function itself, so use TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE instead of
TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE. The delay is presumed to have been written when HZ==100,
and thus has been multiplied by 10 to pass to msleep().
