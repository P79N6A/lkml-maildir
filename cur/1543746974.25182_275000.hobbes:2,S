On the subject of ioctls:  what about a replacement syscall:
 /** 
  * Getting and setting file parameters safely (ioctl done right)
  * 
  * @fd     file descriptor
  * @param  name of the parameter to get/set
  * @dir    direction flag indicating either get, set, or set-get
  * @value  value to set parameter to (set) or store current value into (get)
  * @size   size of value
  */
 int fparam(int fd, const char *param, int dir, void *value, size_t size);
I know it's been talked about in the past.  Is anyone interested?
