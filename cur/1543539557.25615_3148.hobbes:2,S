OH MY, somebody beat the crap out of me as an adult more than twice adult
his youth for flaming a young man.  Ryan please accept my apology for
address you in a vile manner. I did not expect the comment or knowledge
for a person of your youth.
Keep up the good work and would consider being a professional reference on
your VITA if needed and you proved the direction that you are going.
Repsectfully,
