   Might I suggest creating a "/lib/include" that works something like
   the /lib/modules where the kernel name is used to generate the directory
   for the kernel include files?
This is fine with me; as long as there's some what of finding the kernel
headers needed to build kernel modules.  (I'm not talking about user
programs, Linus, I'm talking about kernel ***modules***)
/lib/include and /lib/include/`uname -r`, if we all can agree on it as a
standard, is as good as any.
(Note that's not just the /lib/include/linux we would need symlinked; we
would also need /lib/include/asm as well.)
