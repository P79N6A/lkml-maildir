I did fix a data loss problem with some PPC laptops that way too, that
is just before shutdown and just before machine sleep, sending a STANDBYNOW
command. In the case of machine sleep, I make sure not to accept any more
request (mark the hwif busy) after that and until machine wake up (at which
point I do a full hard reset or poweron reset of the drive).
