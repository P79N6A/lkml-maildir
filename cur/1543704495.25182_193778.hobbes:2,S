Can you post your patch please?  I've been running into this too.  I'm
compiling 2.6.2-rc1-mm3 right now after having commented out the
-funit-at-a-time in Makefile.  I'm running gcc 3.3.3 on Debian with
the stable/unstable/testing branches.  
Of course I posted my email before I read the entire rest of the chain
of messages on this.
Thanks,
John
