Subject: [ANNOUNCE] Animated framebuffer logo for 2.4.1

Hello everybody,
I've created a patch for kernel 2.4.1 that adds some fancy options for
the framebuffer console driver concerning the boot logo.
I've added logo animation and logo centering.
People may find this not very useful but nice to look at. :-)
It can be downloaded from:
   <
ftp://ftp.tuxia.com/pub/linux/tuxia/anim-logo/AnimLogo.tgz>
With this tar ball comes the patch for kernel 2.4.1 and a small
program called xpm2splash to create animated linux_logo.h files
from XPM files.
The patch also contains an animated boot logo (that's why it is
so big).
It is the dancing penguin I've taken from the apache default
configuration of a SuSE 6.4 distribution.
(BTW who created this nice animation???)
So, try it and send your comments.
Juergen Schneider
PS: The patch should work with kernel 2.4.0 too.
PPS: Our FTP server seems to have some problems with the "ls"
     command. You should use "ls -l" or "dir" to get a
     directory listing. Sorry for that.
