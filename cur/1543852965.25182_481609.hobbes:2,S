1) you don't have to run ksymoops with 2.6.x kernels (only with <=2.4.x)
2) your kernel is tainted:
ath_hal: module license 'Proprietary' taints kernel.
http://www.tux.org/lkml/#s1-18
3) your kernel is also patched (Suspend2 isn't in vanilla kernels)
Suspend2 Core.
Suspend2 Compression Driver loading.
Suspend2 Encryption Driver loading.
So I suggest you to reproduce the problem with a vanilla/not tainted
2.6.18.2:
