I think this should go in.

Jon.
P.S. wondering out loud to myself, I finally realized the reason we need
a leaf struct_module function in kernel/module.c. We don't necessarily
have anything else checking for changes to struct module on module load
without this, and we have an embedded struct module in each module that
we memory map as we load the module. I did wonder what was protecting us
from that (especially forced loads). But Rusty does think of everything.
