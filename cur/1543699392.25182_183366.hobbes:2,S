Against 2.6.0-test11
This includes the SMT description for P4. Initial results shows comparable
performance to Ingo's shared runqueue's patch on a dual P4 Xeon.
It also includes the cpu_sibling_map to cpumask patch, which should apply
by itself. There should be very little if any left to make it work with > 2
siblings per package.
A bug causing rare crashes and hangs has been fixed. Its pretty stable on
the NUMAQ and the dual Xeon. Anyone testing should be using this version
please.
