Why would it want to do that?
Anyway, as long as cur_blksz is preserved, sdio_set_block_size() can
easily filter out redundant calls. No need to compromise in the rest of
the code for that.
In the patch I sent, the block size is set the first time is needed.
Wouldn't that avoid all problems?

Right, or remove the lock in the variant I proposed.
