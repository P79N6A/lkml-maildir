Then quit being maintainer. Not to sound rude or anything, but if its effecting your performance of being maintainer, you shouldnt be maintainer in the first place. The Linux kernel is a very important peice of software, not the little project you started many years ago. Its grown beyond what you can manage alone, Linus. Find someone to help you. You cant develop and maintain at the same time. Well, not unless we can clone you, or get rid of whatever real life you have.
