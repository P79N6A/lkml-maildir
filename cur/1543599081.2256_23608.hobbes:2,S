No there isn't.

2.4.7 does the same, spinning in kswapd while everything else is stalled,
except for kernel BHs.
SysRq: Show Memory
Mem-info:

= 0kB)
Swap cache: add 0, delete 0, find 0/0
Free swap:            0kB
8192 pages of RAM
395 free pages
626 reserved pages
581 pages shared
0 pages swap cached
3 page tables cached
Buffer memory:     8000kB
So 2.4.7 was screwed the same way too.
