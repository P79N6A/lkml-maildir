AFAIKS, the kernel is careful to ask for memory (real RAM, not swap space!)
only if it really needs it. But it also uses "otherwise unused" memory for
various caches, which can be cut back if the need arises.

Not in itself, the problem is that if you don't ever want to overcommit
anything you must know exactly how much memory each activity could use, in
the very worst case. And to set things up that way is _hard_. No recursion,
bounded ammount of memory you can {v,k}malloc(), bunded space for buffers,
bounded space for handling incomming TCP connections, bounded space for ARP
cache, ... probably not very hard to do for each one of them individually,
but there are lots of activities to consider. Besides, if you set one of
them up with too little memory, it might deadlock the system. And then, if
you want them to share the total alloted to the kernel, who is it safe to
steal memory from when it runs out? It is a very nasty can of worms as I
see it.
I can understand there are people worried by stuff like C2 security, but in
that case you can work with overcommitment, just make sure the tasks
crucial for C2 can't run out of resources (unless they are broken or the
sysadmin is a complete idiot, that is), and then do as you say: If they do
run out, take the whole system down.
As things stand today, if you want a truly compartamentalized system you'd
probably be better off running each compartment on a completely separate
machine. At least security-wise, and most probably even cost-wise (to
develop and audit an air gap between two systems is a bit cheaper than
ensuring equivalent isolation among tasks on the same machine ;-)
