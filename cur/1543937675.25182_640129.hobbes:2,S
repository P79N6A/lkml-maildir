Here are the numbers (MB/s) from the AACRAID box, after a fresh boot:
Test           2.6.19.2   2.6.24-rc6  2.6.24-rc6-81eabcbe0b991ddef5216f30ae91c4b226d54b6d
dd1             325       350             290
dd1-dir       180       160             160
dd2             2x90     2x113         2x110
dd2-dir       2x120   2x92            2x93
dd3            3x54      3x70           3x70
dd3-dir      3x83      3x64           3x64
mix3          55,2x30  400,2x25   310,2x25
 What we are seing here is that:
a) DIRECT IO takes a much bigger hit (2.6.19 vs. 2.6.24) on this IO system compared to the CCISS box
b) Reverting your patch hurts single stream
c) dual/triple stream are not affected by your patch and are improved over 2.6.19
d) the mix3 performance is improved compared to 2.6.19.
d1) reverting your patch hurts the local-disk part of mix3
e) the AACRAID setup is definitely faster than the CCISS.
 So, on this box your patch is definitely needed to get the pre-2.6.24 performance
when writing a single big file.
 Actually things on the CCISS box might be even more complicated. I forgot the fact
that on that box we have ext2/LVM/DM/Hardware, while on the AACRAID box we have
ext2/Hardware. Do you think that the LVM/MD are sensitive to the page order/coloring?
 Anyway: does your patch only address this performance issue, or are there also
data integrity concerns without it? I may consider reverting the patch for my
production environment. It really helps two thirds of my boxes big time, while it does
not hurt the other third that much :-)

 ouch :-) OK, I will try that.
