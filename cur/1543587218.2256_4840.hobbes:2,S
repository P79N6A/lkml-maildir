In the immortal words of Max Headroom, t-t-talking to myself ;)
In fact, the kernel should probably use a real-time signal
with si_code set to 1 for ctrl-alt-del, 2 for the powerbutton etc.
It should first check if process 1 (init) installed a handler
for that real-time signal. If not, it should use the old
signals (SIGINT for ctrl-alt-del, SIGWINCH for kbrequest).
Mike.
