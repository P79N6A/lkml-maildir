functionality to do this is in devfs and devfsd already.
there are 2 ways:
1. devfs on /dev, maintain state in /dev-state.
2. regular ext2 (devfs naming style) /dev and devfs mounted on, eg,
   /devfs for hotplug and module load/unload updates
1:
/dev-state -> regular ext2
/dev -> devfs
use the CREATE, CHANGE and REGISTER hooks that devfs has to
allow devfsd to transparently copy changes in /dev to the ext2
/dev-state. See the example devfsd.conf for appropriate entries, eg:
REGISTER       .*              COPY    /dev-state/$devname $devpath
CHANGE         .*              COPY    $devpath /dev-state/$devname
CREATE         .*              COPY    $devpath /dev-state/$devname
2:
/dev -> regular ext2
/devfs -> devfs
use the devfs hooks for REGISTER and UNREGISTER to have devfsd update
the static /dev whenever hotplug events occur. Eg:
REGISTER        .*              COPY    ${mntpnt}/$devname /dev/$devname
UNREGISTER      .*              CFUNCTION GLOBAL unlink /dev/$devname
seems to work for me:
[root@fogarty /devfs]# ls -l /dev{,fs}/misc/nvram
ls: /dev/misc/nvram: No such file or directory
ls: /devfs/misc/nvram: No such file or directory
[root@fogarty /devfs]# modprobe nvram
[root@fogarty /devfs]# ls -l /dev{,fs}/misc/nvram
crw-r-----    1 root     root      10, 144 Jan  1  1970 /devfs/misc/nvram
crw-r-----    1 root     root      10, 144 Mar 28 01:56 /dev/misc/nvram
[root@fogarty /devfs]# rmmod nvram
[root@fogarty /devfs]# ls -l /dev{,fs}/misc/nvram
ls: /dev/misc/nvram: No such file or directory
ls: /devfs/misc/nvram: No such file or directory

i prefer option 2 as /dev state is then not dependent on devfsd being
there and it just sidesteps the whole permissions issue. if devfsd
doesn't start then i still have a fully functional /dev.
but anyway... there seems to be loads of scope to do lots of
different things with devfsd, plus NIS support. :)
