Occured here: Ppro 200, 48mb RAM, Matrox fb, Soundblaster 16, smbfs,
IP-masq, using egcs 1.1, ide-scsi, rest is pretty vanilla
Both on 2.2.0 AND 2.2.0-final
ldd is from Glibc-2.0.108 (also compiled with egcs 1.1)
core was from program:
main() { * (int *) 0 = 0; }
core perms were 600
Note, my machine hung hard, with no reboot.
Error message given:
free_one_pmd: bad directory entry 000001e3
