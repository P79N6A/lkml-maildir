Sounds like an EPP-32 problem, try the EPP-16 option. I thought I set 
EPP-16 as default, must check.

Care to add some more details guy? This is not very helpful as there 
are two different drivers for the parallel port ZIP drive. Also were 
you trying to access something else on the parallel port (eg: 
printer)?
Is the "system freeze" a repeatable problem? There was a problem with 
486 machines sometime ago which I cured, it was CPU speed dependent 
(affects SPP and PS/2 mode parallel ports the worst, use EPP where 
possible) so it is a little hard to spot on a very fast machine. I 
had to rip some hand tunned asm code out due to egcs "-Wall warnings".
There is a bug still on my pending list with respect to the mid-level 
driver could not allocate kernel memory causing an OOPS, this is on 
the back burner as the problem is very difficult to replicate.
The output from the "dmesg" command contains a lot of useful info, 
certainly helps in the debugging of a problem.
Finally, send ZIP drive problems to myself or linux-parport@torque.net
I do not follow the linux-kernel mailing list due to mail volume 
restrictions.
