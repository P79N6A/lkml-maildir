Not really. The problem is, that the kernel Makefile contains
an absolute path for depmod (/sbin/depmod) which doesn't seem
like a good idea. I you are installing the module-init-tools
to /usr/local/sbin, they don't take precedence over the old
depmod et al.
Why doesn't the Makefile simply define "DEPMOD = depmod"
instead of "DEPMOD = /sbin/depmod" (and likewise for
genksyms)?
