As a user I know it because I didn't put a kernel source into /tmp. A
programm can't reasonably know that.

Xen has its own memory pool and can quite agressively reclaim memory
from dom0 when needed. I just ment to say that the number in
/proc/meminfo can change in a second so it is not much use knowing
what it said last minute.

I would kill any programm that does that to find out how much free ram
the system has.
