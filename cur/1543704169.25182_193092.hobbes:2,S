Hi again.
When I began work on swapfile support, I looked for an efficient method
to store all the information on which blocks were used. The process led
me to develop something I called ranges, which Pavel later looked at and
said something like 'Oh. Extents.'
Throughout the code, I still call them ranges (I have, for example
struct range and struct rangechain). In preparation for merging, should
I go through an rename ranges to extents, or will they be okay as it is?
Regards,
Nigel
