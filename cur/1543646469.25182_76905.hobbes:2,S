Not sure, without interupt unmasking, I would expect excessive disk activity to potentially cause data loss, but there isn't excessive disk activity going on anyway.
If you look at:
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0207.3/0373.html
though, you'll see why I was asking for clarification before trying 'hdparm -u', because the laptop in question has a broken floppy drive, so if I corrupt the root filesystem, I've got to take it apart, and put the hard disk in another machine to re-install.  Not a five minute job, by any means!
