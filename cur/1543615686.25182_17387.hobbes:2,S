Please see www.linuxdiskcert.org.
This is the first time ever Linux has failed to lead the way because of
patch submission refusal from the folks above.
Please goto IRC Server irc.kernelnewbies.org and join the #kernelnewbies

many of the core developers becoming frustrated with the process.
Some day in the future I will attempt a resubmission.
