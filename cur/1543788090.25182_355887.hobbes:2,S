Usually true.  However, feel free to look at kernel/acct.c and suggest
a way of implementing it in a backward-compatible way that doesn't use
filp_open() and filp_close().  Keep in mind you can't use the 'connector'
framework the way auditd and friends do, because the sys_acct() call has
semantics of writing directly to a file without a listening daemon....
