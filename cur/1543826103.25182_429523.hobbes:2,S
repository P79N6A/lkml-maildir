Subject: [PATCH 04/11] PowerMac: force only suspend-to-disk to be valid
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
From: Johannes Berg <johannes@sipsolutions.net>
For a very long time, echoing 'standby' or 'mem' into /sys/power/state has
killed the machine on powerpc.  This patch fixes that.
This patch adds the .valid callback to pm_ops on PowerMac so that only the
suspend to disk state can be entered.  Note that just returning 0 would
suffice since the upper layers don't pass PM_SUSPEND_DISK down, but we
handle it there regardless just in case that changes.
