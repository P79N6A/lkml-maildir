Subject: unsupported USB or network hardware?

Hi all, I apologize if this is not appropriate for the list, I tried
kernel-newbies first..
I'm an electrical engineer looking to get into writing linux device
drivers, for me the best place to start would be some unsupported
network hardware (new gigabit chips perhaps?)  or USB peripherals.    
Is there a wish list posted anywhere for hardware that is currently
unsupported?
Thanks for any help,
-Chris
