What did Intersil do? How did the linux-wlan-ng project handle this?

Here in The Netherlands, it is quite common to use a US version of Windows and to keep (most of)  the regional settings of the US. So on Windows, most of the time the region is likely to be wrong. I gues that in cases where things are critical, a different firmware version is used. 
It is not really a practical problem however, because the allowed frequencies have become pretty the same over time. The same applies to modems: they are also country-specific. But in practice, it is not really a concern.
But how to go furter with this? Does someone have contacts within Broadcom?

Bas.
