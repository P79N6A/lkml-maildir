More data:
the test file is 2GB in size.
When I do a reboot and time the reading of the entire file,
the first time the performance is great, 27MB.
The second time it sucks, 2.7MB.
I tried clearing memory by allocating and pounding on an array of 512MB 
(size of main mem), that clears out memory but the performance still 
sucks.
Unmounting and remounting the drive does not help.
Any ideas?
