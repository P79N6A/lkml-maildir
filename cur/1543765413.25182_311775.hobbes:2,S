Pavel, you're not answering our questions.
How is the proposed patch any more secure compared to swsusp over dmcrypt?
In fact if anything it is less secure.  If I understand correctly the
proposal is to store the key used to encrypt the swsusp image in the
swap device.  This means that anybody who gains access to the swap
device can trivially decrypt it.
Compare this to the properly setup dmcrypt case where the swap
device can only be decrypted with a passphrase obtained from the
user at resume time.

As to the failed suspend case, the two approaches yield identical
results.  In both cases we will be storing potentially sensitive
data encrypted on a physical storage device.
