Don't you get an interrupt both on a completion and error?
I think you should be using interruptible_sleep_on(&write_wait_queue),
not spinning in wait_event_interruptible().
Most all my DMA transfers use as above and from the time the DMA
completion occurs until the time user-mode code gets awakened in
poll()  (Much worse latency than your code), the time is always
less than 120 us on a 400 MHz ix86 embedded machine with a 100 MHz
front-side bus.
