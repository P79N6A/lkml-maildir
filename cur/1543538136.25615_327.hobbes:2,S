I agree completely.  The point of my patch was that by adding a few (or
100s, not terribly important) cycles to the printk code path we can make
it MUCH more likely for printk's to come out... making printk (which I see
as a debugging tool) robust is a very important thing to do.
Does this make sense, or am I off picking daisies and talking to
myself? :)
