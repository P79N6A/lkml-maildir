The link isn't saturated - we have a 200Mbit/s margin atm. It's not a
bandwidth problem, that's certain.

the only synchronously written logs are auth.log and mail.err, SSL is there
indeed, but the site is hardly ever accessed (as of a while ago, the box has
a load of 0.75, pushing out 14Mbit/s. With 2.4.28 last week it was around
10.0 in the same conditions).

The only thigs writing to disk on regular basis (except for syslog and
apache for logs) are the php session files, one tdb database for traffic
data and mysql (which might be using fsync - can that be the cause of the
i/o slowness?). But, in any case, the machine behaves well under kernels
other than 2.4.28.

nope... the times are in the range 0.000008 to 0.000045...

Any clues as to where too look? I examined the 2.4.28 changelog and saw
nothing that would suggest such change, but then I'm not a kernel hacker, I
might have easily missed something important.

Yep, only one box boots fine with HT enabled (out of the ones with
problems), the others just freeze (we thought it could have been the machine
BIOS, but updating it didn't help)

At this point I think we're gonna run them under the older kernels and wait
for 2.4.29 to see whether the problem still exists there. If it does, we'll
try 2.6 on the machines and if that doesn't help, we'll do some more testing
with 2.4.28 - we have our hands tied, since they are production machines and
we cannot let them run with such degraded performance for too long...

what about nfract_sync? Does it make sense to make it smaller as well? I've
also decreased age_buffer to 15s

Disabling keep-alive is a routine here... :) But, that is unlikely to be the
cause since it's evidently a kernel thing.
Well, I'll see what good the bdflush changes do to the machines when they
run under the "good" kernel and we'll schedule for some testing with 2.4.28
at some point.
thanks for your help, it's greately appreciated!
