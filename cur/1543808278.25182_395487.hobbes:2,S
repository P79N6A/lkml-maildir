Hmm, to make this work well i guess mmap() would need to be changed
to take the policy into account when doing the !MAP_NORESERVE checking
when the kernel runs in strict no overcommit mode.
Otherwise there is no fool proof way an application can prevent getting killed.
And mbind() would need to recompute it and fail if the new policy's possible
allocation are not guaranteed to work.
Doing this all properly would probably get quite messy.
