    remove linux/hardirq.h from asm-generic/local.h
broke the build on sparc64:
drivers/base/topology.c: In function ‘show_physical_package_id’:
drivers/base/topology.c:103: error: implicit declaration of function ‘cpu_data’
drivers/base/topology.c:103: error: request for member ‘proc_id’ in something not a structure or union
drivers/base/topology.c: In function ‘show_core_id’:
drivers/base/topology.c:106: error: request for member ‘core_id’ in something not a structure or union
Even though there is a footnote there from Alexey saying that
sparc64 was fixed up :-)
    [adobriyan@gmail.com: fix sparc64]
I've spent most of last night and this morning trying to figure out
a way to fix this, it is very non-trivial.
Adding a simple asm/cpudata.h include into asm/topology_64.h for the
SMP case does not work.
asm/cpudata.h brings in percpu.h which wants SLAB which wants to use
GFP_* values and thus includes gfp.h
And thus because of the include loop:
	linux/gfp.h --> linux/mmzone.h --> linux/topology.h -->
	asm/topology.h --> asm/cpudata.h --> linux/percpu.h -->
	linux/slab.h
we can't include asm/cpudata.h into asm/topology.h otherwise
we get:
include/linux/slub_def.h: In function ‘kmalloc_large’:
include/linux/slub_def.h:209: error: implicit declaration of function ‘__get_free_pages’
include/linux/slub_def.h:209: error: ‘__GFP_COMP’ undeclared (first use in this function)
include/linux/slub_def.h:209: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
include/linux/slub_def.h:209: error: for each function it appears in.)
include/linux/slub_def.h:209: warning: cast to pointer from integer of different size
for the drivers/base/topology.o build failure case above.
Actually, looking at the patch, where is the part from Alexey
that does the "fix sparc64"?  I see nothing in the patch that
would even appear to possibly be for that.  The diffstat is:
 arch/avr32/kernel/traps.c     |    1 +
 arch/sh/kernel/traps_32.c     |    1 +
 drivers/acpi/processor_idle.c |    1 +
 include/asm-generic/local.h   |    1 -

Was Alexey's fix removed or lost? :-/
