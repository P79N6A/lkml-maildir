	No, I am not doing *that*.  Page-cache methods are using
	32-bit 'page offsets' which are scaled from loff_t offsets
	to internal values by means of '>> PAGE_SHIFT'.
	That is what gives 4G*PAGE_SIZE maximum file size limit.
	(Just because doing 64-bit integer processing is rather
	 painfull at i386 ...)
	The 'struct file' things need loff_t in several locations,
	where they weren't used  (ia_size, i_size, read-ahead things,
	and lock things.)

	Well, our mileages do vary.  That code has been part of
	Large-File-Summit support, which does have mmap64().
	In the  mm/mmap.c  the change is  -2/+3,  that is, nothing
	at all mmap() specific, most of the machinery is needed
	elsewere to support read() and write()...  Just supplying
	64-bit interface by means of mmap64() is peanuts.

	Lets see ... there is stuff all over the filesystems related
	to *pathconf(), and several tests so that the system does not
	use the FS in ways which it can't do -- exceeding 2G limits in
	systems unable to do it intrinsically, for example.
	The support of Large-File-Summit things is major bulk of the
	code, and frankly without it the compability with existing
	application code is  problematic.
