Really sorry about it.

PARISC, Alpha, and IA64 IOMMUs use the two-pass algorithm like SPARC
but their first pass decides how to merge sg entires (and stores that
information in the sg entries), then the second pass simpliy follows
it (Hopefully I understand these IOMMUs correctly, or else I break
them too).
I'll try this work again for 2.6.26. The SPARC IOMMUs are the most
complicated and seems that few people tests the -mm SPARC code. So I
guess that I need to find a SPARC box...
Thanks,
