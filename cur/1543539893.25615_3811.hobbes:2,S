Wasn't too obvious to me:
2 root@asdf:/usr/man/man2# man capset
No manual entry for capset
2 root@asdf:/usr/man/man2# man 2 capset
No entry for capset in section 2 of the manual
2 root@asdf:/usr/man/man2# whatis capset
capset: nothing appropriate
2 root@asdf:/usr/man/man2# apropos capset
capset: nothing appropriate
2 root@asdf:/usr/man/man2# locate capset
2 root@asdf:/usr/man/man2#
I'll go search freshmeat or something I guess...

Ok, thats good, at least I know I wont be searching in vain then.

Right, I understand that, what I meant is by using this feature,
could such daemons be un-rooted, and have the capabilities that
they need, but I think you just answered "yes" to that.

Hmm.  I'm going to hunt on lwn.net or somewhere and see if I can
find a cap-enabled system to explore.  Thanks for the info!
