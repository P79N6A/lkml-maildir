Yes, modifying amd is definitely better than kernel hacking (though the
latter is a lot more fun ... :-)

It's a bit unusual to find an amd user with control over the local host and
not over the amd maps.  At least you're the first to describe such a
situation to me.  If you can install a new amd on your host, you can also
make a copy of the nis maps and modify them locally (perhaps using file
maps) but then you won't get updates automatically.  There's already too
many overrides in amd:
(1) first amd has some built-in default behavior, which
(2) you can override some of it with command line options, then
(3) it takes some stuff from the amd.conf file, first the [global] section,
    and then the individual map, then
(4) in each map it uses the /defaults, then
(5) for each key it uses the options there.
So I'm not sure that yet another override method is necessary, and where it
might fit such that it doesn't confuse things more than they are now.

Yup, it checks if the value is b/t the min/max range, and sets it to either
as needed.  Then it also ensures that it's a power of 2.
