I will try to repeat the experiment with FreeBSD and send the config space
information. 
btw, I had also noticed the corruption in the PIO4 mode. This is the sample
o/p from dt that shows the 4 bytes shifts in PIO4:
Original Buffer:
=====================
0x51972be0  35 a7 a4 81 36 a8 a5 82 37 a9 a6 83 38 aa a7 84

0x51972c10  c2 32 30 0d c3 33 31 0e c4 34 32 0f c5 35 33 10
dt: The incorrect data starts at address 0x3ed70c00 (marked by asterisk '*')
dt: Dumping Verify Buffer (base = 0x3d6af000, offset = 23862272, limit = 64
bytes):

It might be interesting to know what the differences are. Certainly the
bug is a very strange one.
