I don't know.  MEI probably does.

Can you guarantee there won't be any non-AM33 variants of mn10300 that need
supporting?  An AM34, perhaps?
So basically, the toolchain name should change from am33 to mn10300 by your
argument.

There are plenty of other complications for other archs, such as 32-bit vs
64-bit, LE vs BE and other more subtle variants, so your argument isn't that
compelling.

You tell them, they then know.  It doesn't take long.  Standard practice, I
suspect, will involve giving them the toolchains and basic root filesystems.
The discrepancy has been around for years, and I suspect it's not going to
change now.  If MEI ask, I will change it.
