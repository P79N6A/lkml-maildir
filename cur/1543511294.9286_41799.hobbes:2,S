	Just browsed trough the Large disk mini-howto and it seems

There is a patch for 2.0.38 that nobody ever compiled.
There is a patch for 2.3.14 if I recall correctly, that was posted here
and that 1 person was happy with. There is a patch in 2.3.18ac9
that I have not heard any reports on.
So - try 2.3.18ac9.
