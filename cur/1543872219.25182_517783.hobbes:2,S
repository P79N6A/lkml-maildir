it will require to do accounting many times
(and limit checks of course), which in itself
might be a way to DoS the kernel by creating
more and more resource groups

what happens if the parent changes, how is
the resource change (if it was a reduction)
propagated to the children?
e.g. your guest has 1024 file handles, now
you reduce it to 512, but the guest had two
children, both with 256 file handles each ...

the nsproxy is not really relevant, as it
is some kind of strange indirection, which
does not necessarily depict the real relations,
regardless wether you do the re-sharing of
those nsproies or not .. let me know if you
need examples to verify that ...
