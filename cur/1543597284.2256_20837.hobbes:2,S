One problem with this is many of the modules may be difficult to replace
because they are in use.
If someone did want to spend time on a project like this, one place they could
start would be to try to make some of the modules hot replaceable.
As an example that pops to mind would be a scsi driver:
1. Tell the kernel to stop sending it commands.
2. wait for things in progress to complete.
3. save whatever state you need to.
4. remove old.
5. start up new.
6. start restoring state.
6. reset scsi bus.
7. reprobe for devices?
8. finish restore state.
9. tell the kernel we are available.
This example was chosen not because I think the scsi drivers are buggy. :)
It was chosen type of module that someone might want to replace, but couldn't
because it was in use (a file system mounted on it).  
Maybe a network card would be easier to start with, with similar requirements.  
Then you could hope all the patches will be for modules. :)
I also haven't looked at the code to see if it was possible. :)
