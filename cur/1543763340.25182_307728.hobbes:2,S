This one, I like, there's just one small problem:
You can't move scsi_init_cmd_errh() out of the request function path:
It's where we set up the sense buffer handling, so it has to be done
every time the command is prepared for execution (the prep function is
only called once)---think what happens if we turn a command around for
retry based on a sense indication.
So redo the patch and I'll put it in.
