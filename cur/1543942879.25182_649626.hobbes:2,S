Agreed :-)
One more finding: after turning off CONFIG_SLUB and usng 
CONFIG_SLAB instead, I cannot reproduce the bug.
Also, a quite bit Qt-Embedded 3.x programm survives without any 
trouble the suspend/resume. So I think that I don't have a 
general memory corruption problem. This is however just a 
feeling, not an evidence.
