I don't even have to say anything substantial in my response to this  
flame, because I've already said everything substantial that needs to  
be said, but just for clarity, let me repeat myself.
First, let me be repetitious and say this again:

This means that the stat structure *CANNOT* use stdint.h types. Those  
are absolutely forbidden by the standard, because they have been used  
and reused, defined and redefined by userspace programs since the  
dawn of time.  There are standard definitions provided by libc if a  
program wants them, but libc _*MUST*_*NOT*_ force those definitions  
on anybody.  If you don't believe me, quit flaming and go read the  
standards yourself, that's exactly what they say, and for good reason  
too.

There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to  
make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the  
other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious  
deficiencies.  The first method is far more difficult.
