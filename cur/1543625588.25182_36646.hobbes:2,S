This is me talking prior to having coffee, but Chapter 3 of the
Rubini/Corbet book says:
  The flush operation is invoked when a process closes its copy of a file
  descriptor for a device; it should execute (and wait for) any outstanding
  operations on the device. This must not be confused with the fsync operation
  requested by user programs. Currently, flush is used only in the network file
  system (NFS) code. If flush is NULL, it is simply not invoked.
I guess it doesn't specifically say it's not called in midstream, but
it reads as if flush() is called on /only/ close(). I may test this
today, just for fun.

That wasn't me, that was Jeff. :)
