Hi,
there is a raid 0 and raid controller is Smart Array 64xx (rev 01)
hdparm -tT /dev/cciss/c0d0p2 returns the following
/dev/cciss/c0d0p2:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   2660 MB in  2.00 seconds = 1329.92 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  248 MB in  3.00 seconds =  82.55 MB/sec
if i try to hdparm -I /dev/cciss/c0d0 it returns 
/dev/cciss/c0d0:
 operation not supported on SCSI disks
