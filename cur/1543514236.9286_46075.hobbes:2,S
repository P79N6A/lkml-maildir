Hi,
I've been using userland NFS fairly happily for a pretty long time now, and
I understood the format of the /etc/exports file pretty well.  Now that I have
switched to knfsd I just can't seem to sort the format out properly.
Effectively what I had before is a directory called, say, /opt, on the
fileserver that I wanted to be read-only, _except_ for a subdirectory called,
say, /opt/share which was to be mounted read-write with no_root_squash, this
was (fairly obviously) achieved by
/opt (ro)
/opt/share (rw,no_root_squash)
However, this form of exports does not seem to work with knfsd (I'm using the
tools etc shipped with redhat-6.1, together with the 2.2.12 kernel), I just end
up with /opt read-only for everything.
Perhaps even more inexplicable (to me) is that I can have something like
/opt securemachine.domain (rw,no_root_squash)
/opt (rw)
but when securemachine.domain boots up it has root_squash set on the server,
until I restart the nfs server and then it changes to no_root_squash!
Probably I'm missing something blindingly obvious, but any help would be
appreciated.
Mark
