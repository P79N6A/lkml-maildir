Sorry, is it just me, or does this page
http://www.redhat.com/services/techsupport/application/tux.html
not detail exactly how you would go about getting high-priority
support/bugfixes/etc?
And doesn't this page, 
http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla,
 have an entry
for 'TUX' somewhere?
Red Hat has to make some money somehow... I'm sure there is somebody on
this list that is capable of generating tux-odds-n-ends-A1.patch and
hosting it until Ingo/RedHat gets around to merging it, rather than just
whining...
