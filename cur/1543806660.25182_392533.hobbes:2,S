xquad_portio fix declaration missmatch
It seems that the latest gcc-4.x sees the inconsistancy between the 
export of and static declaration of xquad_portio where previous versions
have not.  Fix it up.
  arch/i386/boot/compressed/misc.c:125: error: static declaration of
				'xquad_portio' follows non-static declaration
  include/asm/io.h:315: error: previous declaration of 'xquad_portio' was here
Against: 2.6.16-rc1-mm4
