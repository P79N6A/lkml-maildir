There were a combination of factors contributing to this, including
release-oriented efforts distracting ppl from 2.6 contributions,
disagreements outside kernel.org as to how to resolve this that
resulted in divergent solutions instead of any kind of agreement on a
solution, and so on.
IMHO the only opportunity for convergence etc. is this kind of flamewar
plus actual code rolling in atop it. I'm in the midst of some upheaval
(e.g. on the road plus having getting X running on laptop issues) so
please be patient while I get set up to write whatever code people want
to talk about for whatever alternative solutions they want implemented.
Thanks.
