Hmm, where? - maybe I'm blind or just stupid, but I don't seem to be able 
to find where we do that.
And would it hurt to have that additional check there as well in case 
address was modified after the previous check and before being passed to 
do_page_fault ? (note: I'm writing this last bit without having mined the 
source for info yet).
