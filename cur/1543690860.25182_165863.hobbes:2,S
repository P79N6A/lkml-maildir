Derived works are already restricted (when it comes to distributing them,
otherwise none of this is relevant since you can easily locally make
all EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL be plain EXPORT_SYMBOL). It would be a restriction
on who gets to say what constitutes a derived work and what not - but
that is not governed by the GPL anyway but by the relevant local laws.
The GPL does not and cannot outrank the law. If the law were to say the
authors of a piece of code get to say what is a derived work and what
not, then so it is and nothing the GPL says can stand against it.
