If I would not be in Berlin as well I would ask what good drugs there are to
smoke - heck - wait - there *is* over average drug dealing going along here ...
You still never ever explained *why* you think specifing devices by name
is so bad ...
Have you patched your schillix mount, fsck.* and co to take a pseudo
SCSI ID as well?
Start to get that _the_ interface to devices on Unix and a-like systems
are device nodes in /dev (or simillar) - not artificially made up IDs the
user has to find out for the system (or add -scanbus (or what it was)
to any program executed).
Still if _you_ do not like that, 99.999% of the Linux users and developers
_do_. So stop whining about it.
PS: Yes, I run a bastarized version of cdrecord that has a whole bunch of
crap patched away.
Have fun,
