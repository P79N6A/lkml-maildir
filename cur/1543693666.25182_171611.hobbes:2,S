I'm searching for the/a PNP BIOS patch for 2.4.22 (or 2.4.23pre6) or any
recent 2.4 kernel.  It's included in the 2.4.22-ac series, however that's
with a whole lot of other 'cruft' - and I'd prefer a minimal clean
version.  I'm in the process of cutting it out of the ac patch - however
I'm worried I might miss something (some non-obvious dependancy).  I can't
seem to find any sources/patches on the (apparent) home page of the
project...
Thanks,
MaZe.
