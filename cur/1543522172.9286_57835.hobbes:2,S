Relax,
It is a ZIP disk issue that is corrected with a fdisk clobber!!!
That barf was caused by the first partition being sda4 and not sda1.
Note that sda1, sda2, and sda3 are not defined........
IDE-SCSI translation layer is OKAY.
There is a general block device issues with ZIP drives and the data
partition defaults to hdx4 or sdx4..........
