Further on this problem.  I did a system restore to a disk on /dev/hdb, 
fixed up fstab and other files so I could boot from /dev/hdb1.  I got 
results similar to the original.  However, this time I did get log 
messages.  
I'm also attaching a copy of the configuration used to build this kernel.
What might be a good next step in debugging this?
When I booted up I got the following on the console:
Booting 'tom's test'
root (hd1,0)
Filesystem type is ext2fs, partition type 0x83
kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.5.59-0207 ro root=/dev/hdb1
[Linux-bzImage, setup=0x1400, size= 0xec89c]
Uncompressing Linux... OK booting the kernel
at which time I ceased seeing messages on the console.  However, I 
continued to see drive light activity.  When that ceased, I booted back 
into a stock RedHat 8.0 kernel and did an fsck on the affected drive.  I 
got the following:
[root@dad root]# e2fsck -d -f -v /dev/hdb1
e2fsck 1.27 (8-Mar-2002)

In /var/log/messages I got the following interesting stuff:
Feb  7 13:20:36 dad kernel: Journalled Block Device driver loaded
(how can that be, considering the initial message on the console?)
then I started seeing some of these:
