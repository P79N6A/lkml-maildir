I've been looking at this too (for a tool I'll release Real Soon Now), and
I've run across a few more things that seem to need tweaking.
The tracer (e.g., strace) needs to be able to wait on clone and non-clone kids
at the same time, but the current __WCLONE doesn't allow this.  The change to
exit.c below changes its semantics to make it wait for all kids.  (I wonder if
any existing software depends on the old semantics.  We could always add a new
flag instead.)
The other change lets the tracer observe the new child coming out of a
fork/vfork/clone call.
These changes let me do tracing on a rudimentary case of clone.  (I'm still
working on the other cases.)
