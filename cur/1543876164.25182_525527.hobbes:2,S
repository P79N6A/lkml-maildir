It'd be interesting to know how much is enough. You use one, ppl says it 
is too dense. You use more, ppl says it's too much.
There's the one-line rule for inter-function spacing, but what's the 
include-functions ones? Or the functions-data ones?

Same here. You're the third says this, so I'm gonna change it. But pls 
consider adding it to the coding style.

No idea. It should come out as text at least.

Why? Don't you like fortran-like compact naming? :)

Same thing used in pipes. Avoid loading the hash for things that'll never

Ok, it was panincing, and someone made me change it. Would you please 
agree?
The system can survive w/out, but it'll be a broken system WRT userspace.

Hmmm, the whole point is that all this stuff works with or without epoll. 
And epoll need no changes to support this.
