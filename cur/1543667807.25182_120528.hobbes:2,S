iSCSI is a transport.
logically, any "multipathing" and "failover" belongs in a layer above it -- 
typically as a block-layer function -- and not as a transport-layer function.
multipathing belongs elsewhere -- whether it be in MD, LVM, EVMS, DevMapper 
-- or in a commercial implementation such as Veritas VxDMP, HDS HDLM, EMC 
PowerPath, ...

these are not "iSCSI" or "ENBD" issues.  these are issues with VFS.
