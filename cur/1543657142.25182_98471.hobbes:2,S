I'm a bit suprised noone else has mentioned this so i will.
Your RAID description seems to indicate it is built of four
drives on a two channel HBA.  In other words you have two
pairs of drives each pair sharing a cable (master/slave).
It is my understanding that that is at best a recepe for
poor performance.  From what i have heard ata66 and above is
problematic (out of spec) in that configuration.  I imagine
such a configuration might also cause poor interactions
between the drives.  
Aside from the reputed problems with PDC and with the IBM
"deathstar" drives you might first try adding another HBA
and use better cables before you scrap the drives.
