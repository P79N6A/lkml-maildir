serverraid1E-softraid                PROBLEM
it is redhat AS 2.4.9-25 kernel, SMP kernel for both.
PROBLEM:
  some general FS lock is accuired probably.
  ps axl and top and ls take up to 10-30 seconds to execute
  once heartbeat+softdog got its minute and flushed the whole box
Both computers are identical except one has 1 cpu, oter 2 cpu
2GB memory, bigpages=2100
softraid is raid1, discbox is EXP300, serverraid is 4M
/ is on softraid, sometimes "more /proc/mdstat" gets waiting at last row
for a while.
