Hi sorry if this goes to the wrong person but I'm
tring to submit a bug report to the cpia maintainer
1. cpia hangs smp kernel (deadlock)
2. if you compile in the cpia to the SMP kernel as either
    a module or into the bootable image, when the
    kernel or module load the cpia you get a deadlock
    no ctrl+alt+del no atl+f2 deadeadead :) sorry but
    no OOPS just frozen, this does not happen with
    non-SMP (tested with 2.4.18-17 and 2.4.19)
3. keyword. cpia webcam v4l ?
4. Linux version 2.4.19smp (gcc version 2.96 20000731 (Red Hat Linux 7.3 
2.96-112)
5. not much else to put into here other than it's been working fine 
untill 2.4.18-17smp
    redhat kernel
6. Dell poweredge dual PII 233 with 128 megs ram , parallel port 
creative webcam ver II
7. I did try the new 1.2.2 from souorce forge & compiled as but a 
bootable image &
    module with the same results
Love to tell you more but deadloacks gives no errors or logs, let me 
know if I can help
Thanks Rick Moss
