Subject: [PATCH -mm] x86 port lockless MCE quirky bank0
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I've been avoiding -mm on the Dell Latitude with PIII Mobile for several
weeks now, since APM resume from RAM locks up.  Just stole time to bisect
and it's the x86-port-lockless-mce patches, which lack some of the wisdom
of ages handed down in the earlier MCE source.
The "Don't enable bank 0 on Intel P6 cores, it goes bang quickly" fix
from the old mcheck/p6.c solves my PIII problem; but looking further,
the old mcheck/k7.c says some Athlons also have a problem with bank 0.
So try to handle them both together: but this code is an amalgam of
what was done slightly differently in the two cases, diverging from each
- I don't want to add voodoo if it's unnecessary; and untested on AMD.
Worry: has more such wisdom got lost in the translation?
