Not necessary: You can mount by volume label, or UUID (Yes, need a sane
filesystem for that... and MS-DOS ones aren't. Sorry.)
Dangerous: You plug a _different_ USB stick in, and think it is the same.
Besides, plugging your drive in "the same place" on USB is useful today,
with 1 or 2 conectors. Add hubs, and you are talking about hundreds of
places... better concentrate on getting the machine keep track of
bureaucratic details.
