I'm definately not a fan of automagic kernel configurations, there are way
too many variables. Frankly the way i see it distro kernels do a damn good
job as it is right now and i don't see anything wrong with going the RH
errata kernel style for upgrading kernels (ditto for Debian and their apt
kernel upgrades). All Aunt Tillie has to do is click on the update button.
Are ISA device questions really that much of a big problem? The way i see
it, the user would get flooded more with the plethora of PCI and USB
devices more than anything. Then again i might be missing the "Big
Picture" ;)
