For all length <= minimum slab size alloc_size (and thus
real_len) is equal to the buffer size. You are correct
however that your patch is fine, I somehow misread the
+       if (newlen >= ksize(ct->ext)) {
part and thought you would always compare against the
minimum slab size.
I've queued your patch and will pass it upstream after
some testing, thanks.
