I don't mean to pick on you, but this has been known for over a year
now, right?  Hasn't anyone been preparing for any alternative situation
should this happen?  I know some distros have, but it seems the embedded
people (you aren't the first to mention the "joys" of using devfs in
embedded systems) just have been hoping this wasn't going to happen.
Very odd...

Not true, look at how long it was maintained out of mainline to start
with.  Using the tools we have today (like quilt and git) it should be
quite easy to keep the patch going if you really need it.

I do know that, but again, just reverse the patch and keep it going if
you really want to.  All of the hard work is already done.

Woah, I think Red Hat's and SuSE's "enterprise" distros would prove this
statement wrong.  Also, there have been some people making some boot
images with udev in it for embedded systems that are almost a no-brainer
for someone to use (see the linux-hotplug-devel mailing list for more
info about this.)

I do care about this, please don't think that.  But here's my reasoning
for why it needs to go:
	- unmaintained for a number of years
	- original developer of devfs has publicly stated udev is a
	  replacement.
	- policy in the kernel.
	- no distro uses it
	- clutter and mess
	- code is broken and unfixable
	- udev is a full, and way more complete solution (it offers up
	  so much more than just a dynamic /dev.  Way more than I ever
	  dreamed of.)
	- companies are shipping, and supporting distros that use udev.
	- It has been public knowledge that it would be removed for a
	  number of years, and the date has been specifically known for
	  the past year.
Are you really going to want to update a running system that uses devfs
to a newer kernel?  If so, your distro will have a static /dev or a udev
package to replace it.  If you aren't using your own distro, a drop-in
static /dev tree is a piece of cake for the short run, and udev is
simple to get up and running after that if you really want dynamic
stuff.
And again, for embedded systems, there are packages to build it and put
it in initramfs.  People have already done the work for you.
thanks,
