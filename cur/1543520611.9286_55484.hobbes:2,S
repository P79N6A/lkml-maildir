If they don't go into the standard kernel, maybe
it would be an option to fold them into the
`international' crypto version of the kernel as
can be found at 
http://www.kerneli.org/
 ??
The target audience will probably partly consist
of the same people (security parano^Wconsious
folks who'll do everything to have their machines
secured) and it'll increase the testing audience
for both types of patches.
Linux distributions from outside the US could,
of course, also distribute a slighly hardened
kernel with all of these goodies included...
<hint, hint, hint>
