Hi, i have the similar problem with 2.6.0-test7-bk9 asua p4c800 deluxe
without any sata disk,if apply libata patch durig boot I see intel ich5
right detected, but if enable enanched mode in ide interface, the system
say me disabling irq18 and see many trouble with ide interface, without
data corruption, but the system is unusable.
If disable enanched mode, the system it's ok.
Another ints, from 2.6.0-test6-mm4 with libata to the last snapshot
2.6.0-test7-mk9 I'v notice a downgrade of ide performance not so much
but there is.
I hope this help you
