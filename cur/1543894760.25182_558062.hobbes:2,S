That's not true.  They can just as well throw the key away and refrain
from modifying the installed software behind the users' back.

How about other works in which GPLed software is distributed?
I think your interpretation is mistaken or at least incomplete.

My guess:
First, because it was redundant, given that the license didn't quite
discuss other activities.  Unless you count say "imposing restrictions
on the exercise of others' freedoms" as other activities, even though
these are associated with modification and distribution.
Second, because GPLv3 does indeed talk about other activities, such as
starting lawsuits on patent and pro-DRM grounds, or entering
agreements for distribution of software along with limited patent
licenses.  All of these are still associated, at least to some extent,
with modification and distribution, but I guess it was worth
clarifying that claiming that such harmful activities are outside the
scope of the license isn't a valid excuse to escape the conditions
determined by the license.
