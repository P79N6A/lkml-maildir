Hi Linus, 
I'm writing the driver for the FireStream 50 and FireStream 155
chips. (*)
The cards that I own have a PHY chip that has a 16-bit interface to
the SAR (main) chip.
Current ATM SAR drivers have a routine to write PHY chip registers
that has an 8-bit quantity for the value. Simply extending that is not
good, as some SARs know the difference between writing 0012 and 12
(the first is a 16-bit write the second an 8-bit write) we therefore
need 8, 16, and 32-bit write routines to the phy devices.
If this were done, I'd write my neat litty PHY-driver that would just
use the 16-bit writes. And my SAR chip (FS50) would (as one of the
first) support both 8-bit and 16-bit writes! Mitch (Current ATM
maintainer) and I agree that this is the right way to go about this.
I think it is best to change this interface ASAP (i.e. before 2.4).
Mitch thinks it is best to wait for after 2.4 . I think this is
wrong. What do you think?  (Can you talk some sense into him? :-)
Regards, 
		Roger. 
(*) It's tranmitting and recieving packets (#). It's leaking memory
like a firehose on full blast, but it works :-)
(#) I can't "ping" yet, because I seem to be having a hardware failure
that causes one direction to "not work".
