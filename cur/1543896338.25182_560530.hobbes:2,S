ok, could you elaborate this in a bit more detail? You say it's racy - 
any correctness bug in task_rq_lock() will cause the kernel to blow up 
in spectacular ways. It's a fairly straightforward loop:
 static inline struct rq *__task_rq_lock(struct task_struct *p)
         __acquires(rq->lock)
 {
         struct rq *rq;
 repeat_lock_task:
         rq = task_rq(p);
         spin_lock(&rq->lock);
         if (unlikely(rq != task_rq(p))) {
                 spin_unlock(&rq->lock);
                 goto repeat_lock_task;
         }
         return rq;
 }
the result of task_rq() depends on p->thread_info->cpu wich will only 
change if a task has migrated over to another CPU. That is a 
fundamentally 'slow' operation, but even if a task does it intentionally 
in a high frequency way (for example via repeated calls to 
sched_setaffinity) there's no way it could be faster than the spinlock 
code here. So ... what problems can you see with it?
