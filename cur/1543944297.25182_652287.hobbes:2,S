As noted to Andrew in private email, I think this would be great.
akpm's -mm tree tends to have "x+1" changes in it, and also stuff that's 
not fully baked yet.  I would definitely like to see a tree composed of 
all the sub-trees where maintainers said "yes, I think this is baked and 
ready for x+1".  Then -mm and not-yet-baked git changes can layer on top 
of that.
As others are noting, API changes require some coordination amongst 
ourselves (should be our job, not yours, really) and historically we 
haven't been so good at that -- in part because IMO there hasn't been 
any system thing better than a heads-up email in place.
