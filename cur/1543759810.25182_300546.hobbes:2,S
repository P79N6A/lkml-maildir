For a couple of reasons I've not yet merged Greg's 2.6.11.1 yet but this
diff should actually apply to either right now.
2.6.11-ac1
o	Fix jbd race in ext3				(Stephen Tweedie)
Carried over from 2.6.10-ac
Security
o	AF_ROSE security hole fix - still missing from base
o	Bridge failure to check kmalloc argument overflow
Functionality
o	PWC USB camera driver
o	Working ULI526X support (added to base in .11 but broken)
o	ATP88x support
o	Intelligent misrouted IRQ handlers
o	Fix PCI boxes that take minutes IDE probing
o	Remove bogus confusing XFree86 keyboard message
o	Support fibre AMD pcnet32
o	Runtime configurable clock
	| So you can run laptops usefully. Set 100Hz to fix
	| the power drain, clock sliding and other problems
	| 1000Hz causes
o	Fix token ring locking so token ring can be used again
o	x86_64/32 cross build fixes
o	NetROM locking fixes (so NetROM actually works!)
o	SUID dumpable support
o	Don't log pointless CD messages
o	Minimal stallion driver functionality
