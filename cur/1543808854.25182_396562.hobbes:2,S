Hans -
This bug is about inode attributes (the chattr type), not extended
attributes (the setfacl/setfattr type). Regardless, it's the root cause
of the random attributes we were seeing when the REISERFS_ATTRS
enable-by-default problem was corrected. Thanks to some other people on
the list, I was able to post some patches to address it yesterday evening.
