That is not what gcc did in that case. I don't think it tracks sets of values
over function calls (or even inside functions) at all.
The generated code was
          cmpl    $1, %eax                ; test res
          movl    acquires_count, %edx    ; load
          adcl    $0, %edx                ; maybe add 1
          movl    %edx, acquires_count    ; store
So it just added the result of a comparison into a variable
by (ab)using carry for this.
In theory such things can be done with CMOV too by redirecting
a store into a dummy variable to cancel it, but gcc doesn't
do that on its own.

The conditional add/sub using carry trick is not generally bogus. 
It's just bogus for memory addresses not pretty much guaranteed in L1
[aka small stack frame] because there the pipeline benefit is unlikely to 
offset the memory costs (and of course poor quality of implementation because of the 
missing thread safety). 
But for registers it's a fine optimization.
