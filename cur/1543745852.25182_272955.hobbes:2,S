Hi,
29-4 with PREEMPT works very good (jackd at 64 frames: 0 xruns (running for
1h now), soundcard irq unthreaded). Opposed to 29-1 PREEMPT_REALTIME which
showed some very weird jackd behaviour (xruns from 10usec to 50msec [!!!]).
rtc_wakeup was showing no large jitter for that kernel though, nor did the
different traces show anything that might have caused the jackd xruns. And
yes, i configured the irq handlers sanely :)
Will build 29-4 PREEMPT_REALTIME now and see how this one behaves.
