This probably is a silly question, but....
Is is possible to open a file, mmap() it into memory, then pass the address
of that map via an ioctl() call to the kernel, which will copy_from_user()
that data?
Yeah, that's an odd concept, I know... I could always malloc() some
memory, read the file in, and then ioctl() it.  But, if I could get away
with a direct mmap(), that would be much better for me.
