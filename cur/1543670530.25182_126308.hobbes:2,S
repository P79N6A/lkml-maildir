I see.  Your data is so special that you expect people to pay for
reconstruction hoping to find something that pays for all
that trouble and more.

I have replaced a couple of drives in my life - because a few sectors
didn't read back right.  I expect a overwrite program to be just
fine under such circumstances.

Why would it be hard to reach the inner surfaces - the disks
are not superconducting so the outer ones do not shield the
inner ones from a strong magnetic field.  You should be fine
as long as the field extend far enough to get the entire
drive.  A high-frequency device might have trouble,
but you don't need that - even a static field will do.
