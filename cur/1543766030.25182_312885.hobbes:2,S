Some time ago there was somebody working on copy-on-write links: once
you modify a cow-linked file, the file contents are copied, the file is
unlinked and you can safely work on the new file. It has some horrible
semantics in that the inode number of the opened file changes, I don't
know if applications are or should be aware of that.
