Yep. Worse: pthreads assumes that we don't use the pid as the lock
owner. That again means that the test in locks_same_owner() is
incorrect.
For 2.6.x, the NPTL further complicates matters by introducing the
tgid as their equivalent of the posix process id, and not tying
CLONE_THREAD to CLONE_FILES. AFAICS there's nothing we can do about
that...
So then the correct thing to do is indeed to wrap the call to
locks_unlock_delete() with an fget()/fput() pair, and then to remove
the test for fl_pid in locks_same_owner().
We then need to fix lockd so that it generates correct fl_owners for
its locks...
Let me see if I can get that right.
Cheers,
  Trond
