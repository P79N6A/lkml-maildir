ok the situation is this:
the airo driver has a per card aux_lock.
This lock is used in the hardirq handler, and thus all uses need to be
irqsave (and they are)
Act 1
Enter the mpi_start_xmit() function, which is airo's xmit function.
This function takes the aux_lock first, with irq's off, then calls
skb_queue_tail(). skb_queue_tail takes the sk_receive_queue.lock (with
irqsave as well).
Act 2
Enter the ipcalc program. This program calls an ioctl, which ends up
calling udp_ioctl. udp_ioctl does
   spin_lock_bh(&sk->sk_receive_queue.lock);
This is a deadlock
For brevity, lock A is the aux_lock, lock B is the sk_receive_queue.lock
CPU 0				CPU 1
user context			user context
				udp_ioctl takes lock B with _bh
				(leaving irqs enabled)
mpi_start_function takes
lock A with _irqsave
mpi_start_function takes
lock B with _irqsave and spins
				interrupt happens
				the hard irq handler takes lock A
				.... and spins for cpu 0
eg a classic AB-BA deadlock.
Now a question for netdev: what is the interrupt-or-softirq rules for
the sk_receive_queue.lock?
Anyway, the patch below fixes this deadlock; it may or may not be the
correct solution depending on the netdev answer, but the deadlock is
gone ;)
