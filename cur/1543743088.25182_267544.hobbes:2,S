I'm currently running 2.6.9. No external patches (except for my own 
stuff related to this driver).

No I haven't. Only saw it today and I usually don't use the -mm tree. 
I've gotten the impression it's a bit too bleeding edge for me ;)
What do these patches add to the mix?
I'm also not familiar what the order means. I guess it's some kind of 
priority system? Is there a way I can raise my priority to get access to 
the memory that kswapd actually keeps available?

Is there any other way of increasing the chances of actually getting the 
pages I need? Since it is DMA it needs to be one big block.
