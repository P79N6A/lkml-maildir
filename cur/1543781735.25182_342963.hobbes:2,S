I've written a trivial debug module that can poke around in kernel data
sturctures. Currently it dumps out any task's user space registers, some
flags in its signal structure, and its kernel stack.
I'm considering enhancing it to get to the inode->i_sem semaphore I
suspect and dump out its contents too.

I can boost a remote ssh shell up to SCHED_RR/SCHED_FIFO priority 99. I
know that the root cause of this priority inverstion/starvation issue is
a bug in a priority 4 SCHED_FIFO task, but want to get to the bottom of
who is being starved.

I don't think so. I've unwound the kernel stack (as dumped out by my
debug module) to determine that it is stuck on a __down() of the
inode->i_sem semaphore for a file I know (the fd is on the kernel stack,
and I know which file from /proc/pid/task/tid/fd)

I have hooked up a console, but what good is that going to do for
debugging? As I said, sysrq stuff is not enough to get to the bottom of
this. My real question is if anybody knows of other signatures to look
for in the running tasks, to know which one might be holding the
inode->i_sem semaphore, so I can do something about that task.
