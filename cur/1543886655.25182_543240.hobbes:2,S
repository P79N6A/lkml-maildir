The bottom line... I can see why you're asking for that ;)
I'd say delete the change to arch/i386/kernel/smp.c - contrary to
what Christoph says, no other arch buries a check_pgt_cache() call
in flush_tlb_mm(), that just seems to be a thinko: i386 has the usual
call to it from tlb_finish_mmu() - _that_ is the one which he and
David were talking about.
I'm just worried that there might somewhere be a call to flush_tlb_mm()
which would now be surprised to be freeing pages: almost certainly not,
but why raise that concern?  It's just not flush_tlb_mm()'s business.
The cpu_idle() call should stay for now: we're agreed that it's odd,
but there's plenty of precedent for it, and it's easier to imagine it
serves a real purpose, and shouldn't be removed without replacement.
Bill raised a real concern about unnecessary PAE pgd memory usage,
but let's get the patch into -rc1 to enable the wider SLUB testing,
before coming back to fix that up.  His micro-optimizations can wait.
IMHO
