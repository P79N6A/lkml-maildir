I think it makes sense to have a 64-bit length. It just seems
cleaner because it is in userspace units of file offset. Also,
might you be able to do a single file-sized file<->file splice,
and have it do a remote copy on a suitable network fs, or a
whole-file COW on some local fs (maybe not, as splice doesn't
deal with metadata... I don't know the tricky details of fses).
But your argument against a 64-bit length seemed to involve
limiting the usage that sys_splice would see. Make it 64-bit
instead and someone might come up with something that you
hadn't thought of. Is there any downside?
No offsets :(
Don't they only increase flexibility? Or would you prefer to
add a new sys_psplice for that?
