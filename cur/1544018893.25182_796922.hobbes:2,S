applied to tip/sched/urgent, thanks Alexey.
I also re-added Nick's original patch on top of that (see it below) - this 
way we'll see whether it's all sorted out for good.
Thanks,
	Ingo

Subject: [PATCH] sched: improve preempt debugging
This patch helped me out with a problem I recently had....
Basically, when the kernel lock is held, then preempt_count underflow does not
get detected until it is released which may be a long time (and arbitrarily,
eg at different points it may be rescheduled). If the bkl is released at
schedule, the resulting output is actually fairly cryptic...
With any other lock that elevates preempt_count, it is illegal to schedule
under it (which would get found pretty quickly). bkl allows scheduling with
preempt_count elevated, which makes underflows hard to debug.

[ This is a re-try of this commit:
    7317d7b: sched: improve preempt debugging
  which was reverted in:
    01e3eb8: Revert "sched: improve preempt debugging"
  because this commit:
    d04d99d: x86: set the initial softirq preempt count to SOFTIRQ_OFFSET
  Fixes the real cause of the spurious warning. ]
