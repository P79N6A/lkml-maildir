Can't you just use mlock(), if you want to keep it in RAM?
Or do you need it in kernel memory, because you need it in the lowmem area? 
Or for interaction with other kernel code?

Write a device driver, kmalloc some buffer, and copy data via a write 
function from userspace to that buffer. Should be trivial.

Of course, kmalloc only works up to some boundary AFIACS.
