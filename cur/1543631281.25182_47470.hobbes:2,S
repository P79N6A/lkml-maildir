All the cases you encounter above are cases where Linux
leaks a more palatable interface.
/proc/cpuinfo for one could be replaced by dropping syslog
messages at a fixed file in /etc/ during boot - it's static after
all!.
DRI is one of the few XFree86 things which indeed
got born in the linux context. It should in fact run on
top  of either the /dev/agpgard ir /dev/fb device.
/proc/dri is a war... similar to the former /proc agp stuff..
/proc/bus - is not as bad in my opinnion :-).
