Is this perhaps on a laptop? Some scripts for laptop use configure
insanely long data flush times to conserve HD spin time. Sometimes
it is even completely turned off (laptop mode). The extent 
flush is dependent on the configured bdflush or pdflushd data
timeouts.
The truncate is independent from this because it is flushed with a 
different path.
