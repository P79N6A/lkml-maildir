Make sense to me. What about the one below? The problem is though, that we 
have two different events here. One is the single step trap and the other 
one is the signal. And according to the comment, strace want something 
different from SIGTRAP to continue with signal. So it wants the double 
event we are actually sending (ptrace_notify + send_sig). OTOH Wine does 
not seem to like the double event thingy. Hmm ...?
