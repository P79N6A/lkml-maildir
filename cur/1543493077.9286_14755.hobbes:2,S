I know, I made them ... :)

This is a _production_ system in a _customer_ . I can't play _that_ much
with this system. If I could, I certainly would, believe me.
Anyhow, it shouldn't happen even in 2.0.36. Furthermore, I've never seen
it happen before. And we (Cyclades) have a very _very_ large Cyclom-Y
installed base using this HW version / kernel driver version, so I really
think this is a very weird and particular case.

It is executing it, I checked that. Anyhow, I strongly believe that we
should _first_ solve the problem with the wrong allocation of the PCI
resource (I/O instead of memory address), and then probably everything
would be solved.

A Cyclades card or something else ?!?!? If it was a Cyclades card, I'd
like to know more details about it (pieces of code, etc.).
