Here's some more information about the disk from the boot log.
I also found some StatusErrors in there.
May 10 11:14:07 web3 kernel: hda: Maxtor 6Y120P0, ATA DISK drive
May 10 11:14:07 web3 kernel: hda: max request size: 128KiB

May 10 11:14:07 web3 kernel: hda: task_no_data_intr: status=0x51 {

DriveStatusError }
May 10 11:14:07 web3 kernel: hda: Write Cache FAILED Flushing!
Thats a different error then what it gives me occasionaly. Googling this
error lead me to believe this is a bug in the ide driver, that my disk
doesnt support some flush command.
After parsing the log with simple script, these sectors seem to give the
errors:
227270012
227270483
236708724
237757036
237757472
238018530
238020393
238279554
238804853
239066426
239328347
239590823
240116567
240121662
58619113
58619120
58619127
58619447
58619448
58619519
58620045
58620048
58620331
I've tried to reproduce these errors by rsyncing the whole filesystem,
executing various find / commands, but nothing triggered them. The
machine is primarily a web server, so my guess is they happen when
apache tries to do something to the disk. 
The output from smartctl -a seems a bit large to include in this email.
