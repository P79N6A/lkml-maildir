OK.  But now is basically the worst time for me (or anyone else) to merge
large code-motion changes like this, because they need to be carried for
two months or more.
And even though git can track renames, putting them into a git tree (say,
git-kbuild) won't help, because if some other git tree tries to modify a
file in its original place, I get to fix up the fallout.
Which I _could_ do, and would do if the patches were particularly risky or
added/changed functionality or whatever.  But they don't do that, and there
is little advantage in maintaining them for the >2 months.
So.  Please redo and resend the patches when we hit 2.6.25-rc6 or so?
Thanks.
(linux-next will largely fix all this: git will take care of the renames
and I'll just base the -mm queue on the consolidated linux-next.  But we
aren't there yet).
