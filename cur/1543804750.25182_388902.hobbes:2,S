Sorry for the late response, I've been away for the week.

This is the way libcap expects the capabilities string. I never
questioned the format of this string. But it isn't hard to do a simple
mapping.

Look for keep_capabilities in security/commoncap.c. If you do a
setuid() away from root, Linux drops all privileges. Inhcaps does a
setuid() and arranges for keeping the needed capabilities.
