Doh, yes. I completely missed that stack dependency of the pointer
when I looked at the patch back then. The solution looks solid and
probably we should get rid of the unnamed union member and fixup the
other places which use restart_block in a similar way.
Just a minor nit. Can we please use "futex" instead of "fu" ? I'm just
envisioning the next union member named "ba".

Please apply with the s/fu/futex/ change. This needs to go into stable
.22/.23 as well.
Thanks,
