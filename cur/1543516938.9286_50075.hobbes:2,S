   I plan to work at it for 2.5. We need:
	o  Resource manager capable of assigning free addresses to newly
	   inserted devices. This is already present in 2.3.
	o  Extend the bus scanner, so that it's able to re-scan specified
	   slot after a card is inserted. Close to trivial.
	o  Write drivers for hotplug PCI bridges. Should be easy, but unfortunately
	   I don't have any machine I can test it on.  [Anyone willing to donate
 	   hardware (hint, hint! :)) ?]
	o  Define some way how drivers can register their initialization
	   functions to be called when a new card is inserted. We can probably
	   use the same mechanism as CardBus drivers do.
	o  Extend kmod to call modprobe with vendor+device ID when a card
	   is inserted and no internal driver wants to handle it.
