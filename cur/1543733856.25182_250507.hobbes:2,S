In the case of the ppc vDSO, there is no .data section, the descriptors
are in the .opd section along with the .text, but that isn't a problem.
That means that 1 page of vDSO text will be COW'ed for the few apps that
request a different address (again, unless we want randomizing). The
vDSO also has a special data page that _has_ to be shared, but it's
separate and doesn't overlap the actual .so pages so it shouldn't be
affected by a possible relocation.
Of course, unless somebody comes up with a clever trick to avoid those
altogether...
Ben.
