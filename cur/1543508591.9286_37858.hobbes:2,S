do you try to dump an ippp-device? that doesn't work... afaics the
problem is, that the incoming isdn-packets captured have already
ppp-headers stripped, but outgoing haven't (or was it the other way
round?). I don't know for sure whether it's the libpcap's fault or the
kernel-implementation of sync-ppp, but i guess it's the latter...
