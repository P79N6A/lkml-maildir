Kill it for 2.3 and have people cast around to see if they have anything that
depended on it. I can't imagine there is anything, but if it turns out it's
a problem we can stick it back for 2.4.

Did you give any thought to my NTFS problem (did I even tell you about it)?
The problem is the FILE records can span multiple blocks and I want to avoid
the kmalloc, memcpy stuff that the driver currently does. The buffer cache
doesn't (AFAICS) cope with reading chunks that are multiples of the block
size ATM, 'cos it ain't needed for normal filesystems.
