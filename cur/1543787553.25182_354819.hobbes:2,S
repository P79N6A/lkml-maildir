	Easy cross-toolchain for kernel
Requirements:
	* should be built from the same source as native toolchain with
minimal patches
	* should produce normal packages
	* should be buildable with minimal PITA in reasonable time
	* package metadata can (and obviously will) differ, but delta should
be minimal and easy to maintain
Recipe for FC4 follows; feel free to contribute equivalents for other
platforms.
1) Grab binutils-2.15.94.0.2.2, gcc-4.0.1-4.fc4, glibc-kernheaders-2.4-9.1.94
and glibc-2.3.5-10.3 SRPMs from any mirror (i.e. sources for native toolchain).
Install them (rpm -i .....src.rpm).
2) grab ftp.linux.org.uk/pub/people/viro/cross-build/*
3) out of the above, drop binutils*.patch into the SOURCES directory where
rpm had left vanilla binutils source
4) sh build-binutils and install resulting rpms (binutils-<target>)
5) sh build-kern_headers and install resulting rpms
(glibc-kernheaders-{alpha,ia64}) 
6) sh build-libc-headers and install resulting rmps (libc-headers-{alpha,ia64})
7) sh build-gcc and install the results (gcc-<target>, cpp-<target>)
List of targets to build in is file called, surprisingly, "targets".  libc
headers are needed only for alpha and ia64; if you don't need those, ignore
(5) and (6).
