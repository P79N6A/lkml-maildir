Hi,

Great.
Linus, this is one of the most frustrating things about trying to
actually implement some of this stuff: you get so bogged down in the
"don't do it badly" that you never get around to talking about "do it
well".  
When the flames about raw IO errupted, the _only_ thing I was able to
get out of you was "raw device IO is evil".  It seemed to be
impossible to get you to turn the discussion around to the
requirements for file IO, because every pronouncement you made about
the whole subject ended up with "raw device IO is evil".
Again with journaling, it's a case of "don't you *dare* touch ext2,
ext2 is inviolate" rather than "yes, go ahead but keep the existing
code intact".  See the difference?
