One reason I dislike the push to use NULL everywhere is that
new-comers may feel a false sense of security when using NULL.
This will bite in places where an explicit cast is needed to turn
NULL into a null pointer of the correct type, i.e., pointer arguments
to variadic functions.
A neat trick to catch such errors is to define NULL to be 0LL.
This is perfectly legal under ANSI and will generate a different
representation on i386.
Cheers,
