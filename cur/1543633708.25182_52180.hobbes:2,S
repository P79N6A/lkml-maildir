Hi All,
I'm designing a multithreding application with many threads,
from ~100 to 300/400. I need to take some decisions about
which threading library use, and which patch I need for the
kernel to improve the scheduler performances. The machines
will be a SMP Xeon with 4/8 processors with 4Gb RAM.
All threads are almost computational intensive and the library
need a fast interprocess comunication and syncronization
because there are many sync & async threads time
dependent and/or critical. I'm planning, in the future, to distribuite
all the threads in a pool of SMP box.
Thanks in advance.
Roberto Fichera.
