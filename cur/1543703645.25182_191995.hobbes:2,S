On the note of SATA interfaced drives, is there a way to power them
down? 
I have recently attached my spare PATA drive with a converter and use it
just for backups (mount, rsync, umount). I have these configured through
SCSI (/dev/sda) with the 3112 2.6.1 support. hdparm comlains the drive
is SCSI... is there a similar command to power it down?
thanks
