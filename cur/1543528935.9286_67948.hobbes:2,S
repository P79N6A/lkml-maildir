The argument here is essentially that shared-memory as a programming
model doesn't scale, as well as message passing can.. DSM just makes
it more evident.
But the lure of the easier programming model is substantial; and
applications come in all flavors from will scale on anything, to
won't scale on shared-memory but do OK on message-passing, to won't
scale on message-passing either - it boils down to the extent of
state sharing and synchronization inherent in the application.
There's been considerable research in shared-memory protocols which
have mechanisms to (try to) bring the communcation/synchronization
down to the 'implicit in the application' minimum, as a msg-passing
program would. They seem to work for some applications but I wouldn't
say are general enough to be practical.
But they mostly are explicit communication primitives within the
context of coherence protocols and consistency mechanisms. I think
one could reap most of the 'ease of programming' benefits of
shared-memory programming by just having a global-address space and
build 'put'/'get' kind of primitives to communicate explicitly on
the top - kinda like msg-passing.
