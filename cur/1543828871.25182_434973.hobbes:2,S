This feature is less useful than it could be in that it only allows a 
per-task raw notifier to be added to the current task.  For the per 
process CPU capping client that I'm writing, I'd like to be able to 
attach one of these to a task that's being forked (from the forking 
task).  Not being able to do this will force me to go to the expense of 
maintaining my own hash tables for locating my per task data.
On a related note, I can't see where the new task's notify field gets 
initialized during fork.
