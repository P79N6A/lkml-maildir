I have a similar setup.  (Using SATA instead).  I boot with ACPI=off and
(irqfixup if using the onboard nv SATA controller).  Make sure your BIOS is
set to a non-pnp OS.  
In addition, I'm having some sort of race between X and keyboard driver
(seem to interact with SATA too).  I solved that by setting CPU affinity to
the same processor for X and the keyboard IRQ handler.
Booting with apic=verbose might give some useful output as well.
Good luck, I've beating my head against the MB since I got it.
