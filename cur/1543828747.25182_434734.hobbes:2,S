Yes, when you only use the hrtimers to implement signals. But what if you 
use them for something different?

"Horrible" in what respect?

No, not really. And then a little bit in a generalized way:
The kernel could have these threads as general working threads on which 
all kind of callbacks could be executed at their right priority.
But, ofcourse, having 100 tasks sitting around per CPU is huge waste of 
memory. But maybe some kind of pooling could be made?
As I said in a another mail some time back: Having 100 different RT 
priorities doesn't make sense. You can at most need 10 anyway.

What if the thread is running?

Hmm, a practical thing to do would be to make a system where you can post 
jobs in a thread. These jobs can then be done in thread context 
around schedule or just before the task returns to user-space.
