No offence but this feels a bit wrong to me.
PCI is sort of more a chipset property than a cpu property (I realize
that this boundary is changing of course).
I'd like to ask you to at least rename some of the feature bits to
indicate that the extended config space is for the IO access method;
after all Linux already supports the MMIO method for accessing extended
config space since a really long time; not marking the feature bit to
indicate it's the IO method is going to be extremely confusing and
cause bugs I bet.
(we probably need a global function that drivers can use to find out of
extended config space is accessible; however that for sure isn't a CPU
capability bit. However the current naming etc sort of makes me fear
drivers will abuse this thing while thinking it's the right API)
