Putting the count into struct resource does not make sense.

The idea is to not rely on the exact pnp resource table structure and
abstracting this to macros. If krealloc approach works,
dev->res.port_resource[i].start would even still work, if not, it's
easier to alter the pnp resource table and the macros internally.

Krealloc should only get used at early pnp init time, when the BIOS
structures are parsed. The devices shouldn't be active then...
A bit of a problem, as said, could be the sysfs interfaces, there it
must be insured krealloc is not used anymore.

Ok, I think I see the main problem: Externally built drivers would
break.
I can try with a "do not alter exported interfaces if it could be
avoided" approach.
I'd add these then:
#define pnp_port_ptr(dev,bar)
#define pnp_dma_ptr(dev,bar)
...
I will come back in some days...
