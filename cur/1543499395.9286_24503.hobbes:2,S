We just have such limit for the swap and it's set to 32 pages if I remeber
well. In the normal write to disk (via filesystem) case instead the limit
is forced to the 42 requests slot shared by all block-writes operations.
That make sense but it become an overkill for reads if we are writing
continously to disk.
