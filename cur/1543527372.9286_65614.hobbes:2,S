Right now the system is pretty non functional if you do not have
/proc. Then there was the argument that if you are willing to enable
procfs you should be willing to enable devfs.

I didn't claim that there was a conspiracy, I was asking for
clarification. The last couple of days there has been a bit of
discussion over moving things to devfs.

In the past devfs has always been advertised as an _option_ now you
say that we _move_ in the direction of devfs .... move pretty much
implies default.
