I've a "Onda N501HS" umts/gprs pcmcia card. I've attached it to the pci
bus using a pci<->pcmcia card.
I've tested with two kernels, 2.6.8 (from debian sarge) and 2.6.18-rc1
(compiled). Both kernels can't recognize the card at the boot time, only
the debian kernel can recognize it if i remove/reinsert it while the
system is running.
Logs from 2.6.18-rc1:

Logs from 2.6.8 (debian sarge):

Tell me if you need more info/debug.
ciao
