Ok, I've been doing a bit more digging to work out what's going on.
The code which crashme generated corrupted the user stack pointer.  We
then tried to deliver a signal, found the user stack pointer invalid,
and tried to deliver a SEGV to the process via force_sig().  Unfortunately,
this signal never made it through for the reasons described previously.
(We dequeued the ILL, found we couldn't setup the stack frame, force_sig,
returned to userspace, generated another undefined instruction exception
on the same instruction, etc.)
So, not only is userspace not able to kill off processes with SIGKILL,
but the system can't kill off a process with a seriously corrupt stack.
Should the signal code be using something more forceful than force_sig()
(ie, something which is guaranteed to work) when the stack is corrupted ?

From the above, I think the problem is a little larger than just SIGKILL.
I think this problem happens on ARM because when we return to user space
after being unable to deliver a signal, we try to re-execute the illegal
instruction.  I believe on x86 this does not occur - it returns to the
next instruction.
