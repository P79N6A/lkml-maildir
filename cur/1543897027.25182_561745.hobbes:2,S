Unfortunately, this kind of problem is rather difficult to diagnose. 
Essentially what's happened is that we've sent a command (in this case a 
cache flush) to the controller but it's given no indication that it's 
done anything with it (somewhat different from the case in the link you 
mentioned above, where the controller indicates it's sent the command 
and is waiting for completion). This could be some kind of drive issue 
or drive/controller incompatibility, a controller bug, the driver doing 
something the controller doesn't expect..
Does this drive actually support NCQ? I can't tell from this part of the 
  log.
