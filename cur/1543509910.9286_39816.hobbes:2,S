Can someone point me where to find information about writing 
new line discipline as I need that in process of writing kernel network
device driver for device that is connected via serial port.
Info found in ppp driver gave me some clue, but is there any real
document, book or something.
Haven't found anything in Rubini's, Beck's and some other books.
Thanks in advance for any reply.
Ivo.
