It's been bad in the past, I agree. But the advertised way to work with
this hasn't changed in the past few years, and was and is still sg v3.
So you should support that through read(2)/write(2) to /dev/sg*, or
through SG_IO ioctl to the device. The latter is recommended since
currently works for all devices, plus it's the simpler (and good enough)
interface to use for cdrecord since it doesn't require queuing.

If you have issues with SG_IO, please feel free to address them. If they
are valid, I'd love to help you get it fixed.
