Not that I know of. I saw it because a friend of mine tried to port
some old code and played with the include ordering. Somehow he got
a compile error doing it, and we found that it is strange that sysfs.h
is using structs from list.h but is not including it. As result I sent
the patch to propose that it gets included to avoid any possible
trouble.
