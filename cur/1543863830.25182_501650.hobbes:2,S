Interesting to know.  Looking more closely, it looks like machines
here are split between the messed up output I forwarded previously and
the output that is expected.  All of my personal boxes are messed up.
Having looked at HAL earlier, it appeared to have code to parse the
new format but if it desn't work, it doesn't work.  Updating HAL is
relatively easy but I can't test the changes on my own boxes because
they have the messed up /sys/class/sound structure.
