Ahhh... You have some scripts that you run. Care to share?
This is no NUMA syste? Two processors in an SMP system?
So its likely an issue of partial slabs shifting between multiple cpus and 
if the partial slab is now used on the other cpu then it may be cache cold 
there. Different sockets mean limitations to FSB bandwidth and bad caching 
effects. I hope I can reproduce this somewhere.
