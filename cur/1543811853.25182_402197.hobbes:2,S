In a perfect world, where we are all kick-ass programmers and never get
anything wrong and can always anticipate exactly how people will use the
interfaces we create, sure we could say this.
But until then, there's no way this can happen :)
For example, look at all of the gyrations that the sys_futex call went
through.  It took people really using the thing before the final version
of how it would work could be added.
And another example, /proc.  How many times over the past 15 years have
we had to upgrade the procps package to handle the addition or change of
one thing or another?  We evolve over time to handle the issues that
come up with different architectures and needs.  That's what makes Linux
so great.
Now remember, this is only a very small subset of programs that fall
into this "changing interface" category.  For 99% of the programs that
run out there, they only use the standard POSIX syscall api, and they
never change (Binaries built for Caldera 1.0 still run on 2.6 this day
as proof of that.)
But everyone here on this list feels the issues as we are doing the
development of this system.  It is a real system, consisting of parts
that are outside of the kernel in order for everything to work properly.
And if we want to pull some of those pieces into the kernel tree proper,
in order to handle the change and churn better, that's fine with me too,
but is outside the scope of this classification document.

It's not a "new" fetish at all, look at the huge number of ioctls, proc
files, sysctls, mmap interfaces to devices, etc.  It's just that the
list of these interfaces has never been fully documented or classified
(find any DRI/DRM interface docs in the kernel tree lately?)
Hopefully this proposal will help address the need for figuring out what
is changing in the kernel, and help userspace programmers to know what
they can and can not count on remaining stable in the future, both near
and far.

The "stay in -mm" statement is nice, but unfortunately will not really
help.  Look at how many people really run and test -mm.  What is it, in
the low 100s at the most?  And we have how many, 900+ individually
documented kernel contributors over the lifetime of the kernel?  Even if
all of them run -mm, we would not have the spread or reach that we
really need to be able to classify interfaces as "stable" all the time.
All of those developers are working on their individual pieces and
rarely look up and see what else is going on around in the kernel.
