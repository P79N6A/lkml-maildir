i just implemented the trivial fix below and it gave me a massive, 2.3% 
text size reduction (!) on a typical .config. That's more than 120K 
shaved off the vmlinux.
Why, despite being aware of this bug, you never fixed this properly is a 
mystery to me - this is more .text size savings than you have done so 
far with all your uninlining patches of the past few years combined, and 
it's probably more than you could have achieved in the next 5 years.

allow gcc to optimize the kernel image's size by uninlining
functions that have been marked 'inline'. Previously gcc was
forced by Linux to always-inline these functions via a gcc
attribute:
 #define inline	inline __attribute__((always_inline))
Especially when the user has already selected
CONFIG_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE=y this can make a huge difference in
kernel image size (using a standard Fedora .config):
   text    data     bss     dec           hex filename
   5613924  562708 3854336 10030968    990f78 vmlinux.before
   5486689  562708 3854336  9903733    971e75 vmlinux.after
that's a 2.3% text size reduction (!).

+	  This option determines if the kernel forces gcc to inline the functions
+	  developers have marked 'inline'. Doing so takes away freedom from gcc to
+	  do what it thinks is best, which is desirable for the gcc 3.x series of
+	  compilers. The gcc 4.x series have a rewritten inlining algorithm and
+	  disabling this option will generate a smaller kernel there. Hopefully
+	  this algorithm is so good that allowing gcc4 to make the decision can
+	  become the default in the future, until then this option is there to
+	  test gcc for this.
