Can we be any more specific?
What is the interference - is it transmitting random packets, or just 
emitting a magical cloud of invisible anti-wifi?
At which precise point does the interference start? Does it happen even 
without the driver loaded?
Which operation is the one which stops the interference, the enable or 
the disable?
Does this happen on every plug in, or just sometimes? Is it affected by 
usage patterns such as having the device plugged in throughout boot, 
reloading the module, etc?
Thanks,
Daniel
