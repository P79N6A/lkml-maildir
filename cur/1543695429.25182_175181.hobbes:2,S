Subject: APM suspend still broken in -test9

I reported this also on -test8:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=106694328730337&w=2
and it was confirmed by two other people in that thread.  I just
tested it again with -test9.  Putting my laptop to sleep while X is
running, then resuming, locks the machine hard.  Suspend works fine
without X (plain old console mode).
The three machines reported so far:
 - Fujitsu P-2120 (me)
 - Gericom        ( Oliver Bohlen <oliver.bohlen () t-online ! de> )
 - Thinkpad R40   ( Ruben Puettmann <ruben () puettmann ! net> )
Both Ruben and I have agp configured; he has a Radeon while I have a
r128 (Rage Mobility M).  I don't know more about Oliver's config.
Can anyone else verify this?  Everything worked fine in -test7; things
broke in -test8 and are still broken in -test9.  Nothing appears in
the logs (which is to be expected if we crash while resuming... where
would it get logged?).
Ian
