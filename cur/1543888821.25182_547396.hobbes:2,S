thanks! This trace indeed includes the smoking gun, htb_dequeue() and 
__qdisc_run():
   privoxy-12926 1.Ns1 1597us : rb_first (htb_dequeue)
this goes on, non-preemptible, for 160 milliseconds (!):
 privoxy-12926 1.Ns1 161568us : rb_first (htb_dequeue)
 privoxy-12926 1.Ns1 161568us : qdisc_watchdog_schedule (htb_dequeue)
and finally manages to escape the loop:
 privoxy-12926 1.Ns1 161597us : rb_first (htb_dequeue)
 privoxy-12926 1.Ns1 161597us : rb_first (htb_dequeue)
 privoxy-12926 1.Ns1 161599us : htb_safe_rb_erase (htb_dequeue)
 privoxy-12926 1.Ns1 161599us : rb_erase (htb_safe_rb_erase)
 privoxy-12926 1.Ns1 161600us : htb_change_class_mode (htb_dequeue)
 privoxy-12926 1.Ns1 161601us : htb_activate_prios (htb_change_class_mode)
and the system recovers.
David, any ideas about what's wrong with htb_dequeue(), based on this 
trace?
