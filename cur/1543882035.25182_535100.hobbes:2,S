Fifthed here, Adrian. It could potentially become one of the best things
to happen to the mainline release process (and I believe has already been
worthwhile). Even if it takes a while for people to get on board, or some
regressions slip through. And note, a release with regressions doesn't
make your hard work useless -- you've still got the important who, when,
how, etc. info that can be used in future, and it could serve as a "known
issues for upgraders" document as well.
