Hi
I'm having trouble with 2.4.5, where 2.4.4 worked fine. The problem is the
following: I pass an initrd image to the kernel, which is a compressed image
of an ext2 filesystem. The ramdisk size is set at 12 MB (12288 KB). The
kernel is passed "root=/dev/rd/0" (using devfs, mounted automatically at
boot-time by the kernel), but for some reason it can't find init (results in
a kernel panic), this works perfectly with a 2.4.4 kernel. Oh, and btw, this
works fine in 2.4.5 if I pass "root=/dev/fd/0 prompt_ramdisk=1" with the
initrd image placed on a secondary floppydisk.
What went wrong in 2.4.5?
Thanks,
Ole André Vadla Ravnås
