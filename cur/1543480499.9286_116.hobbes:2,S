Everything on the machine has either got fsync()/sync() options disabled
or is using an LD_PRELOAD wrapper so that it doesn't.  Trust me, I even
patched the kernel to report processes that call fsync()/sync() to track
everything down...It should be only up the OS to flush buffers IMHO.

Hmm...What would this do?  Allow flushing to be done asynchronously?
Is there anything that could be unsafe with this change?
