Subject: DVB: BANDWIDTH_TO_KHZ strangeness

drivers/media/dvb/frontends/dibx000_common.h contains:
<--  snip  -->
...
#define BANDWIDTH_TO_KHZ(v) ( (v) == BANDWIDTH_8_MHZ  ? 8000 : \
                             (v) == BANDWIDTH_7_MHZ  ? 7000 : \
                             (v) == BANDWIDTH_6_MHZ  ? 6000 : 8000 )
...
<--  snip  -->
Commit b6884a17fc70e979ef34e4b5560988b522bb50a0 added to both of 
drivers/media/dvb/frontends/dib7000{m,p}.c:
<--  snip  -->
...
        factor = BANDWIDTH_TO_KHZ(ch->u.ofdm.bandwidth);
        if (factor >= 5000)
                factor = 1;
        else
                factor = 6;
...
<--  snip  -->
factor < 5000 is obviously never possible.
drivers/media/dvb/frontends/dib0070.c contains a similar assumption that 
BANDWIDTH_TO_KHZ() could result in values other than {6,7,8}000
(I haven't checked whether there are more such assumptions in other 
places).

        of the darkness. There had been need of rain for many days.
       "Only a promise," Lao Er said.
