Tested the patch and I confirm that it fixes the problem. Regarding the
confidence level, in my case I can say that on a suse 10.0 I can always
reproduce the bug on every shutdown. Anyway, I'm not using the default
kernel shipped with suse 10.0, but maybe the same bug could be seen in
opensuse 10.3 that (if I'm not wrong) uses a 2.6.20.
BTW there are not enough details, but a similar problem seems to be
already reported here:
