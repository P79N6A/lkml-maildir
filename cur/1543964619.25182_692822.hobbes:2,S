External modules have bugs because interfaces change. Film at 11.
It's true, but it definitely shouldn't keep us from just doing it. 
Especially since well-maintained external modules (ie the authors follow 
big discussions like this) can just take the kernel lock regardless of 
kernel version, since it won't even be broken with old kernels.
Of course, well-maintained kernel modules wouldn't depend on the BKL in 
the first place. Oh, well.
