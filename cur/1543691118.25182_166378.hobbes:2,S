On booting 2.6.0-test5 I receive this message repeated continuously:
hdc: sata_error = 0x00000000, watchdog = 0,
siimage_mmio_ide_dma_test_irq
On reading the archives, I would just like to verify that this message
is no more than an annoyance, as it appears from the one thread (
http://lists.insecure.org/lists/linux-kernel/2003/Jun/0241.html
 )  I
found regarding this error.  Can somebody please advise?  Thanks in
advance.
Chris
