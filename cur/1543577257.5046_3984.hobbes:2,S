I removed it because otherwise I would have had to do twice as many tests
to convince myself that all combinations of flags and printer states
worked correctly. I can reinsert it if you think that's necessary. But
then I don't think the tunelp man page and the comments in the kernel
should say that it is obsolete. I think obsolete means "you should never
ever have to use this stuff".

At least with my printer, it only discards data when it is powered off. If
you power off the printer between the times when lp_wait_ready returns and
parport_write is called, I think it is ok to lose data. After all, if the
power off had occurred a few ms later, the data would already have been in
the printer when it was powered off, and then you would have lost data
anyway.

: not ;).
I don't understand the lowlevel parport details, so I can not comment on
this.
