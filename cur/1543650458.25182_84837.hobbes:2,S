Easier than you think, perhaps.  Depends how much compression you're
after, of course, but here's how Acorn did it in RISCiX (a 4.3BSD
derivative):
Pages were 32k (an interesting feature of the MMU...), and the underlying
filesystem was a fairly vanilla BSD FFS (probably 4k blocks with 1k
fragments; discs were around 50MB).  Each page was written at a 32k
boundary, but compressed.  So there were holes in the file where other
files could store their data.  Naturally you waste on average 512 bytes
per 32k page, but I think they managed to get 80MB of unix distro onto
a 50MB disc this way, so it's nothing to be sneezed at.
