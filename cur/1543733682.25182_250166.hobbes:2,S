Subject: [test] pagetable OOM handling (again, but 64-bit this time)

/*
 * This appears to panic an Altix. An earlier version of this without
 * the VSZ limiting appeared to panic a 4x logical x86-64 box, and yet
 * another version panicked an E3K. panic string:
 * "Kernel panic - not syncing: Out of memory and no killable processes..."
 * The basic idea is to keep mm->total_vm low enough to evade VSZ rlimits
 * and avoid the OOM killer long enough to get into a state where the
 * SIGKILL will be ignored. mm->total_vm is kept low with the 1 pte per
 * pmd trick. Getting into 'D' state is done by faulting in pte pages.
 * It also relies on a race that clobbers PF_MEMDIE instead of getting
 * stuck in a non-allocating codepath where it waits in 'D' state in
 * order to ignore signals. "Normally" the task->flags setting works;
 * however, the restoration of ->flags after the try_to_free_pages()
 * call in __alloc_pages() causes tasks to honor OOM kills while they
 * don't honor signals per se; the race means that if it's caught
 * between the the load and the store of the restoration (x86 addressing
 * modes make this either far less likely or impossible) PF_MEMDIE is
 * lost. To do this more reliably on x86-64 finding another way to get
 * into 'D' state outside the allocator for a sacrificial victim or
 * something on that order is needed. Having little enough RAM to be
 * able to use the VSZ of pid 1 as a limit would also work. Of course,
 * I can't be 100% certain how it does what it does without more
 * instrumentation, but these things are at least what motivated how I
 * wrote it. Originally zeromap_page_range() on a large (ca. 512GB)
 * virtual area and fork() of only a few processes was what triggered
 * the panic() (and much faster than this does on ia64), but that
 * didn't seem to do anything on x86-64. Altix' console log included.
 * This test is useless on 32-bit architectures.
