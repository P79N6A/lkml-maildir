mmap_mem suffers from a lack of proper checks as well.  For example, on
Altix page 0 of each node is reserved for prom and a read or write to it
will cause an MCA.  mmaping /dev/mem with offset 0 will nicely explode.
Would adding a pfn_valid test in mmap_mem be the best bet, or could we
consolidate the checks currently in mmap_kmem into mmap_mem?
