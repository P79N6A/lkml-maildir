I see no problems over here. Linux makes explicit use of GCC features,
it was not meant to be compiled with a different compiler. Note that
the Linux kernel is not a normal program, so we don't have to deal with
compatibility. If you want to use another compiler to compile your
kernel: go ahead, but don't expect any help from this list.

That's what the __uXX/__sXX data types are for: to ensure that the data
types are indeed XX bits long. See include/asm-*/types.h.
