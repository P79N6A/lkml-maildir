|ChangeSet@-3w|cset@1.1527.1.20 
That's a nice patch. Why not make the same change in 2.6?
I forward ported the patch linked above with a few minor changes - my 
version differs from the original in these ways : 
 - use ssleep() instead of schedule_timeout.
 - rename tries to retries and actually retry the specified nr of times 
   ( if (retries--) {...} instead of  if (--tries) {...} ).
 - use a short instead of int to hold the retry count.
 - change the text outputted a little bit.
 - retry a few more times (15 instead of 9) since if we fail here we are 
   going to panic() we might as well try hard, and who knows how slow some 
   devices can be?
Andrew, would you consider including the patch below in 2.6 ?
