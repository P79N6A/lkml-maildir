In which case, perhaps I should have mentioned this before:
martind@ithaki:~$ sudo fdisk -lu /dev/hdb
Disk /dev/hdb: 300.0 GB, 300069052416 bytes
255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 36481 cylinders, total 586072368 sectors
Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
/dev/hdb1              63   586067264   293033601   83  Linux
martind@ithaki:~$
> If you force an fsck
I'll schedule some downtime but I thought the above might be worth
mentioning immediately.
