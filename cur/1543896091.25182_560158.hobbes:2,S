I presumed an ELF note or extended filesystem attributes were already
in place for this sort of affair. It may be that the model implemented
is so restrictive that users are forbidden to create new executables,
in which case using a different model is certainly in order. Otherwise
the ELF note or attributes need to be implemented.

Beware that the kernel (upstream of me) will likely refuse to support
to exotic mmap() placement policies. At that point userspace will have
to implement them itself with a front-end to mmap().
Userspace can actually live without kernel placement support for
everything but the executable itself, which is already implemented via
ELF loading standards. This is not to downplay the tremendous amounts
of pain involved for moving the stack, getting ld.so to land in the
right place, and so on. Actually I'm less sure about .interp placement.
In any event, exotic virtualspace allocation policies are largely yet
another "simple matter of programming" implementable entirely in
userspace.

It's actually not a good idea to make it the default even via sysctl.
People won't realize something will break until it does, and what will
break is likely to be a database responsible for data integrity. The
IPC_RMID creation flag should suffice.

I doubt this will be controversial, but it's not clear to me that there
is any convenient way to obtain an anonymous inode on anything but tmpfs,
in which case it's not really anonymous, but not visible to userspace on
account of the default kern_mount(). Essentially it's possible to hoist
the tmpfile name generation in-kernel to where it's in a disconnected
namespace not visible to any userspace whatsoever, and kernel threads
can cooperatively ensure safety via access discipline. Alternatively,
one could kern_mount() a fresh tmpfs filesystem for some concurrency
domain, e.g. per-uid, per-process, or per-thread.

I think this may be doable via an mremap() flag barring needing to
break it up into multiple syscalls so it's implementable on all
architectures. That itself will be so difficult to get merged the
duplication may have to stand on its own as an mremap() flag.

mremap() already has so many arguments this is going to be difficult
to get merged. Breaking it up into multiple syscalls will not be easy
to get past people, and there are architectures that can't implement
syscalls with too many arguments.

If those two are the bare necessities, they're already in place.
