Solved!
Just configure the SB driver instead (the one I had disabled *sigh*)
Last I checked the AD1848 driver wouldn't load still... but the Sb-16 emu
works really well.
PS: yes I did do everything else.  The closest related card (OPL3SA2) docs say to disable the sb stuff IIRC (could be wrong source isn't on this computer) which is why that was the last thing I checked....
G'day, eh? :)
