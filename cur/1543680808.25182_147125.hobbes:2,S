There is no problem with the current version of this patch.  I rewrote 
the original patch to work around the bug in gcc.  The bug is that:
	if (size < X) return kmem_cache_alloc(...);
would not cause the remaining if statements to be marked as dead code, but:
	if (size < X) goto found;
	...
	found: return kmem_cache_alloc(...);
does optimize properly.
