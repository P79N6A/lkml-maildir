Yes, but I don't think I should have to give gcc flags to get it to
obey the C standard (my example can easily be turned into a
self-contained strictly conforming program, in order to qualify for
the full weight of the standard).

gcc is not doing the right thing.  My example contains no type punning
or other deviations from ISO C which might warrant
-fno-strict-aliasing.  The program should behave as if the assignments
are evaluated sequentially; with this compiler, it does not.
> The kernel already checks to see if gcc can grok -fno-strict-aliasing
Yes, since the kernel needs to say to gcc "I know this code relies on
more than the ISO C semantics, so please be gentle with it".
