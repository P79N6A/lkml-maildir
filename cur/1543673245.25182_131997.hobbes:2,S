This should only happen when your hardware receives a "RESUME" signal
from a USB device AND the host controller is in a global suspend state
at that time.
Now I think the wait_ms() call is valid for when this is really
happening, but it sounds like you are having this happen all the time
during normal operation.  Are you using any USB devices with this
server?  Is USB enabled in the BIOS or not?
Also, Johannes / Alan, should we be verifying the global suspend state
when we read this value so that we don't accidentally call wakeup_hc()
for hardware that sets this bit in an illegal way?  I think that might
be the proper fix for this problem.
thanks,
