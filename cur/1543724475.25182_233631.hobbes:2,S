No, it doesn't.
close() will flush the C library buffer.  That means the data
moves from theose buffers to the pagacache. The program crashing
after that will have no effect on the file.  It can still
be lost if the _kernel_ crashes though.
If you want the pagecache flushed to disk, use fsync (or sync)
