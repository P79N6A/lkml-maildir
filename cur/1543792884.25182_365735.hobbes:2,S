Dear Partner,           
Greetings! 
For this letter is strictly personal, intimate and confidential. Forgive this unusual manner of contacting you, but this particular letter is of exceptional and very private nature. There is absolutely going to be a great doubt and distrust in your heart in respect of this email, coupled with the fact that, so many miscreants have taken possession of the Internet to facilitate their nefarious deeds, thereby making it extremely difficult for genuine and legitimate business class persons to get attention and recognition. There is no way for me to know whether I will be properly understood, but it is my duty to write and reach out to you. For I know that you are the only one that can be trusted to handle this project effectively without making us regret. The recommendation I got concerning you, is enough to get us started with you.
 I head a four-man committee on debt reconciliation at the oil Ministry, where I am also a Director of Project Implementation. In recent past, we have carefully arranged a contract with a foreign firm, in which the cost was over-invoiced deliberately to favour us. Now, we want to get the funds out of the apex bank into your provided account within one week from now, and a percentage (20%) will be given to you for your assistance and efforts. The amount we are about transferring is totalled at US$13,731 million. Also, there is the need for you to know that, we shall be sending you upon commencement, about $3000 that will be used in taking care of some expenses, as well as settling some taxes here, which you shall handle personally., so there are absolutely no bills to be paid by you in the course of the transfer.
 Note however that it is only on the condition that you have an account domiciled in the United States or in the UK, that is when we shall make the funds available to you. Our financier is only prepared to release funds to the US & UK only. But if you are outside these regions, we will have to talk further. All we need from you now is a concrete mailing address, to enable us send via courier money orders in the amount of $3000, which you shall use in settling the bills as they come. We have set aside funds to offset whatever bills that crop up in the event of transfer.
 You will certainly ask yourself how consequential this letter is. Indeed, is it not surprising to receive such a letter seeking immediate assistance? This is why today I am making you a non-binding, unrestricted offer, to bring us close into mutual understanding and cooperation now, and in the near future. Trust is definitely the most noble trait in the world, and I urge you to trust my sincerity and the word of a simple and humble person of faith, who in the name of love for her equals is willing to accomplish the task of doing business with a trusted and transparent person. It is up to you to decide whether this letter deserves your trust and confidentiality.And if indeed it does, send me the following: 
[1.] Your letter of consent.
[2.] Your mailing and contact address.
[3]. Your telephone numbers. 
Upon receipt of the above, I shall communicate with you, and let you know the details of the transfer. Whatever your actions and your decision, I thank you for taking the time to read my email.
 Best personal regards.
Kabiru Issa
