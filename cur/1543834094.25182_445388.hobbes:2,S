B-trees are mostly used in file systems in the kernel.  For example NTFS
and HFS (and I think HPFS) use B-trees for various metadata like
directory indexes for example.
But of course your implementation is purely userspace and cannot be used
in the kernel (you use recursion for example...) so I am not sure how
you envisage to help the kernel with your code...
Best regards,
