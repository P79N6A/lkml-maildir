I think this is a completely bogus logic. Even root has the right that
we don't crash his system willingly. Imagine what will happen on a 100Mbit/s
or gigabit ethernet interface. The real solution is to increase the socket 
buffer - but you really have to limit the queue somehow.
BTW, a more useful change would be reliable counters on when a tapped
packet is dropped because of out-of-memory (in /proc/net/netstat). Currently
there are many cases when there is no counter increased. With that users
could reliably diagnose when their packet socket buffers are too small or
when their dump machine can't keep up. I did most of the work for this in 
late 2.1, but it was too late for the code freeze.

Because that API is obsolete, and Linux does not want to support it 
forever.
