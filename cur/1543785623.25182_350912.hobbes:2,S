Yes, this is what I described :) Maybe this was not clear.

Well no, since a user app can manage itself this part if it happens to be 
performance critical.
Sample of a user land lib : Each time a new fd is returned by 
open()/socket()/pipe()/accept()... the thread should call
fd = fdcache_dupfd(fd);
And close the file using  fdcache_closefd(fd) instead of close(fd);

/*
 * Unix kernel has an expensive get_unused_fd() function :
 * This is because semantics of Unix mandates that a open()/pipe()/socket()/ call always returns the lowest fd, not a random one.
 * Linux use a linear scan of a table of bits.
 * A program handling 1.000.000 files scans about 128 KB of ram, with a spinlock held : No other thread can get a fd.
 *
 * The trick is to use this library to make sure 64 low fds are available, so that the standard unix functions 
 * dont have to scan a lot of fd before finding a free one.
 * And remap them using fcntl(F_DUPFD) at precise slots we manage ourselfs.
