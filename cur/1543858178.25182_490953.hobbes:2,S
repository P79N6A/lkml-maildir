Could you be a bit more specific? If I write a module implementing a
line discipline, how would I go about having that line discipline
push itself onto a given serial port (specified for example through a
module parameter) immediately, during its own module initialization?
I can't seem to find an in-kernel interface for that.
Also, if I understand correctly, this would only work if the driver
is compiled as a module, but such a limitation seems to be frowned
upon within the kernel community. Any way around that?
Thanks
Tilman
