     This is a minor annoyance but when building Linux on a Sparc 4-CPU
machine, if I type:
	make vmlinux
     So that it only has one job running, it builds all the way fine, but slow.
     If I type:
	make -j4 vmlinux
     So that it actually makes use of those CPU's, it tries to link the kernel
before it has everything compiled, so I always end up doing:
	make -j4 vmlinux
	and then...
	make vmlinux
	to finish.
     It wasn't necessary to do this with the 2.0.x kernels.  It would be nice
if this were fixed, though I'm not savvy enough with make/build/depend to know
how to fix it myself.
