sure but you need that ANYWAY; the management tools will want a generic
"THIS hypercall" thing

yeah a syscall sounds right for this

that's a different thing; the ballooning driver obviously has to be in
kernel due to how it interacts with the VM, and having it's 1 or 2
controls in sysfs (hint: make it writable module parameters, so that the
defaults can be set at module load time, and you'll also get the rest
for free ;)
pure hypervisor info... no. "only" 8Kb of code + all data structures..
for something just as easily done in the management layer. In fact I
suspect the management layer will do the hypercalls anyway just because
it's easier to do than parsing sysfs !
