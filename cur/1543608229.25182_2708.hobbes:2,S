When you e.g. have a TCP sniffer it makes sense to only bind it to ETH_P_IP.
If the sll_protocol field is not fully supported it should be removed.

Do you worry about the handling of hundreds of packet sockets? 
Using the ptype hash before was nice, but does not look like it is absolutely
required. The overhead this way is not much bigger for a reasonable number
of packet sockets (and for a large number the current ptype hash is likely 
inadequate anyways)
