First of all, let me apologize to not subscribe the list. I'm sending my 
question to that list because I did not found any other list that could 
solve my problem, but I can't keep attention to that kind of list 
because it's too technical.
I'm running a Brazilian distro called Conectiva CL8 with 2.4.18-3U8_4cl 
kernel version and raidtools-0.90-8cl.
My server is running on a very unstable site because of power supply 
problems and some times, when the server goes down because of power 
failure, when rebooting we face a lost of synchronization and the raid 
devices have to be resyncronized. I don't have any lost of data but the 
resync process brings a performance trouble.
There are anyone that could tell me if this is a known problem and if 
there is anything I can do to minimize my problems ? Unfortunately I 
can't solve the power supply problem :-(
Thanks in advance.
Xyko
