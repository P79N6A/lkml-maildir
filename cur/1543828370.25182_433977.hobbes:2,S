Why? This information is currently useless. What you want is that something 
knows that you want this driver to be loaded. So, everything you need is one line:
MODULE_ALIAS("virtual_dev");
(add this to loop, nbd, ppp_generic, uinput, dm-mod and other "virtual" drivers 
of your choice)
and the initscript that does a "modprobe virtual_dev" to catch them all.
