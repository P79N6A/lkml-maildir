I think the problem they have is really related to their spinlock, that
is the IO leaking out of the spinlock vs. other CPUs.
On the other hand, as I discussed with Jesse in the past, I'd like to
extend the semantics of mmiowb() to also define full barrier between
cacheable and non-cacheable accesses. That would help fixing a lot of issues
on ppc and ppc64.
Typically, our normal "light" write barrier doesn't reorder between cacheable
and non-cacheable (MMIO) stores, which is why we had to put some heavy sync
barrier in our MMIO writes macros.
By having an mmiowb() that allow to explicitely do this ordering, it would
allow us to relax the barriers in the MMIO macros, and so get back a few
percent of perfs that we lost with the "fix".
I haven't had time to work on that yet though, I need to review with paulus
all the possible race cases, but hopefully, I'll have a patch on top of
Jesse next week or so and will start converting more drivers.
Ben.
