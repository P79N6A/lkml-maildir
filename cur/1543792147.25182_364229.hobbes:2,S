Ok - thanks.

Correct - should be no problem.

That part still surprises me a little.  Is there enough difference in
the performance between:
  1) task_lock, which is a spinlock on current->alloc_lock and
  2) rcu_read_lock, which is .preempt_count++; barrier()
to justify a separate slab cache for cpusets and a little more code?
For all I know (not much) the task_lock might actually be cheaper ;).

I don't think I care ...  I'm just sampling task->cpuset->mems_generation,
looking for it to change.  Sooner or later, after it changes, I will get
an accurate read of it, realized it changed, and immediately down a
cpuset semaphore and reread all values of interest.
The semaphore down means doing an atomic_dec_return(), which imposes
a memory barrier, right?

Understood.  Thanks for your comments on the alternatives - they
seem reasonable.
