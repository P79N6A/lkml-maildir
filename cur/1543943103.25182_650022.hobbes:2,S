Thank you for the feedback, Pavel.
There is an additional patch which creates
Documentation/acpi/wmi.txt, but I witheld it from
this batch because it needs to be revised.
If you are not subscribed to the linux-acpi list
you can find it here:

Clearly we neeed to update the Kconfig doc as well when
we revise and push that patch.
