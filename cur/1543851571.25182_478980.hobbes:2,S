Perhaps a better solution is to 
1. get rid of DMA zone
2. have another alloc funciton (e.g., kmalloc_range()) which takes an
   extra pair of parameters to indicate the desired range for the
   allocated memory.  Most DMA buffers are allocated during start-up.
   So the alloc operations should generally be successful.
3. convert drivers over to use the new function.
