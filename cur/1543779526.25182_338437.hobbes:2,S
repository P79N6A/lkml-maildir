Hehe, my strategy of lame response and sloppy patches seems to be working
then! :)

Thanks a lot, I really appreciate help on getting this thing cleaned up for
x86 + PPC. The ARM version is already merged to mainline, but that's did
not have all the legacy issues, and ARM has nice sys_timer...
I'll try out your patch today at some point, and will post a merged patches
that also integrate the PPC support.
I don't understand the "bad gzip magic", that happens while uncompressing
before kernel boots, right?
Regards,
Tony
