| If I understood correctly, this might help:
| 	. TPC (www.tpc.org)
| 	. JMOB (jmob.objectweb.org)
| 	. IOZone (
http://www.iozone.org
)
I would generally call those workloads, not necessarily databases.
It seems that Sumit wants workloads that are specifically for
stressing/testing databases.
OSDL has several database workloads in the STP (Scalable Test
Platform) project at  
http://www.osdl.org/stp/
E.g.:
dbt1-1tier  A single tier iteration of the DataBase Transaction One test.
dbt2-1tier  Database test based on TPC-C workload
dbt2-pgsql  Postgres version of DBT test.
dbt3        Database test based on TPC-H
dbt3-pgsql  dbt3 port to PostgreSQL
DOTS        Database test by IBM
Perhaps Sumit could use one or more of these.
