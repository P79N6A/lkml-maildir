1. confusion with the text cursor, which should blink
2. need for continuous pixel-to-pixel accuracy with the mouse
3. you can wiggle your mouse as needed to find the mouse cursor
Apps do funny things when you try to wiggle the text cursor
with the arrow keys, and movement tends to be harshly constrained.
So the blinking is important.
