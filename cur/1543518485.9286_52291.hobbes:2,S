	As of linux-2.3.31, drivers/char/drm/drmP.h deliberately aborts
the compile the CPU type in the kernel build is configured to be 386.
The problem is that this is the way that one builds a kernel that can
run on any x86 (to avoid things like generating the BSWAP instruction,
which the 386 lacks).  It does not necessarily mean that the CPU is
actually a 386.  This change to drmP.h makes it impossible to build a fully
configured for the full x86 processor family.  If there is some reason
why the "direct rendering infrastructure" should not run on a 386, then
this check should be done at run time, not compile time.
