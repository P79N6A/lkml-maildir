Most of the code doesn't care about physical addresses, because they
either work with virtual memory or with the page structure. Physical
addresses are only interesting to pass them to the hardware or to put
them into the page table.

So far I've only seen a virtual address with some offset. You can maybe
move that offset around, but you can't remove it. In the end it's the
same.

I'm happy to see patches.
