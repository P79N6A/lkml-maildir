One vote in the opposite sense (I know, nobody uses plain rc6 ???)
I am using a -jam kernel (-aa with some additional patches), and I did
not notice anything. Dual PII box with 900 Mb, as buffers were filling
memory, no stalls. Just a very small (less than half a second) jump in the
cursor under gnome when the memory got full, and then smooth again.
I use pointer-focus and was rapidly moving the pointer from window to
window to change focus and response was ok. Launching an aterm was instant.
