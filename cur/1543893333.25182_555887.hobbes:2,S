Well, hardly. The percentages quoted vary wildly with the point someone is 
trying to make but "user users" are expected to just use whatever their 
distribution provided them with meaning the Kconfig target audience is 
developers and "power users". Enough of the latter around certainly but I 
have no indication whatsoever that a significant number of them is lost in 
the water without Kconfig translations either.
Internationalization is not very useful, has great potential to introduce 
even more chronically bit-rotting content and is finally counter-productive 
  in maintaining a non-forking single community, at least in so far as it is 
today. One should spit on internationalization.
