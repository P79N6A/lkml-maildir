Great, To summarize the discussion. Will there be a problem in 
accepting ASCII and the UTF-8 ASCII _subset_ _only_ and  return 
-EINVAL for all other cases/ecnodings ?.
i.e. The fragment I sent in a previous message:
/* Filter UTF-8 non-ascii compatible bytes (> 0x7F) */
if (!isascii(c)) return -EINVAL; 
/* Filter unwanted ascii chars */
if (!isspace(c) && !isgraph(c)) return -EINVAL;
