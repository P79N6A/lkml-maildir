Wait wait wait... your scenario implies that the kernel has knowledge of
the chip to mask the irq in the chip in the first place.
If that is the case, then you have a chip specific kernel driver,
yadada, the whole story is moot :-)
We were talking about the idea of having some "generic" reflector of
irqs to userspace without device specific knowledge.
