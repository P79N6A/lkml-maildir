Hello!

pc_keyb.h is a kernel include, thus it uses the kernel set of types
which unfortunately collides badly with the types used in user space.
The best solution is to create your own include and copy the
relevant parts of pc_keyb.h there.
BTW what exactly do you plan to do? Sending keyboard controller
or mouse controller commands from user space is probably very
dangerous as it's going to collide with the commands sent by the
kernel.
				Have a nice fortnight
