The logs from your other mail show that the touchpad is still in
relative mode (using 3 byte packets) instead of absolute mode (using 6
byte packets.) I don't know why this happens, but here are some things
to investigate:
* Does the touchpad work with the synaptics XFree driver and a 2.4
  kernel?
* Does the Synaptics aware GPM version work?
  (:pserver:cvs@ar.linux.it:/data/cvs)
* Can you add some printks to the synaptics_reset() function to see
  why it fails?
* Maybe it helps to remove the call to synaptics_reset() in
  query_hardware(). (I know this helped one user that used the user
  space XFree driver with a 2.4 kernel.)

You should use /dev/input/eventX, where X is a number that depends on
your hardware configuration. My config looks like this:
Section "InputDevice"
        Identifier      "TouchPad"
        Driver  "synaptics"
        Option  "Device"        "/dev/input/event2"
        Option  "Protocol"      "event"
        Option  "LeftEdge"      "1800"
        Option  "RightEdge"     "5400"
        Option  "TopEdge"       "4200"
        Option  "BottomEdge"    "1500"
        Option  "FingerLow"     "25"
        Option  "FingerHigh"    "30"
        Option  "MaxTapTime"    "180"
        Option  "MaxTapMove"    "220"
        Option  "VertScrollDelta"       "100"
        Option  "HorizScrollDelta"      "100"
        Option  "EdgeMotionSpeed"       "40"
        Option  "MinSpeed"      "0.08"
        Option  "MaxSpeed"      "0.10"
        Option  "AccelFactor"   "0.0010"
        Option  "SHMConfig"     "on"
        Option  "EmulateMidButtonTime" "75"
#       Option  "UpDownScrolling" "off"
