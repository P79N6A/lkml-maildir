Well, there was a tail merging patch for ext2, but it has been dropped
for now.  In reality, any benchmarks with reiserfs (except the
very-small-files case) will run with tail packing disabled because it
kills performance.

Yes, I wrote it...

That is coming this summer.  It will be part of some changes to support
"meta blockgroups", and the resizing comes for free at the same time.

Probably will happen in 2.5, as Andrew is already testing htree support
for ext3.  It is also in the ext3 CVS tree for 2.4, so I wouldn't be
surprised if it shows up in 2.4 also.

Well, the dump can only be inconsistent for files that are being changed
during the dump itself.  As for hanging the system, that would be a bug
regardless of whether it was dump or "dd" reading from the block device.
A bug related to this was fixed, probably in 2.4.19-preX somewhere.

Let me know what you find.  It is possible to use an htree-patched
kernel and not have indexed directories - just don't mount with
"-o index".  Note that there is a data-corrupting bug somewhere in
the ext3 htree code, so I wouldn't suggest using indexed directories
except for test.
