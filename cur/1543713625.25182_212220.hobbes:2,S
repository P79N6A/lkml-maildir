And it works perfectly for me too (with the pcmcia net card, debug
started by sysrq+g).
There are however a couple of cleanups and a compile fix attached.

Maybe this could be done in a more kgdb-independent way in the
netpoll layer. There is already some code there who waits for
the carrier on a net card. Maybe this could be extended to also
wait for the network card to appear...
