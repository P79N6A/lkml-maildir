Hm, as traditionally we haven't had such an active x86 maintainer, I've
handled most of the pci quirk type stuff that people have sent to me in
the past :)
But, now that we have more enthusiastic developers, I can change this.
If you want me to cut portions of the patch up, I'll be glad to do so,
just let me know.
It's easy for me when merging, as our tools can handle it just fine, but
Andrew is the one with the big problems, so we should probably shake it
out on our end first...
Ingo, what is easiest for you to do?  As I use quilt, I can very simply
cut a portion of the patch up, or drop it entirely.
thanks,
