That usually means random memory corruption from somewhere -- dcache
tends to use a lot of memory and when it is corrupted anywhere these 
functions tend to crash while walking the lists. 
Unfortunately memory corruption is hard to track down because
the messenger is usually not the one to blame.
Perhaps enable slab debugging and see if it turns
something up. Could be also broken hardware. Does an older kernel
run stable? If yes and if it can be reproduced bisecting would
be good.
