if you see all possible paths through the program as a tree which branches 
for every decision then you only need to cut off the branches that are 
actually pointing upward the tree again. This would still allow to follow
down into the callees of the recursive function because there should be 
at least one path that is non recursive (if not Checker should definitely
complain ;) 
e.g.
       ----<-----------------+
	   v                     |
 IF   TRUE                RECURSION
-------+------ some path ----+
       |
	  ELSE                    non recursive path 
       +-------------------------- other functions ---------->
Other functions can be still checked, you only need to prune the cycle.
I have no idea if checker's algorithms actually work like this, but I could
imagine that it would be one possible implementation.
