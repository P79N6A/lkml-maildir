The real solution, as it has been since before Linux was even around, is that
if you don't know where perl is installed, you make the thing #!/bin/sh and
call perl on itself;
It goes something like...
===
#!/bin/sh
eval 'exec perl -w -S $0 ${1+"$@"}'
    if 0;
===
perl sees the 'if 0' on the next line and knows not to do anything.
the shells just execute the first line without looking at the second one.
(grabbed from a random perl script called "HEAD" on my system, I'm sure
it can be found in thousands)
The problem has been solved for years.  Use the existing solution.
David.
