You said that MD5 wasn't strong enough, and you would like a guarantee.
You won't find a guarantee unless you are prepared to use memory
barriers in your code.  _Any_ checksum is going to have a chance of
false validation if you are doing out-of-order reads which can observe
parts of the old and new data, and parts of the old and new checksum.

Consider when the data {1,0,1,0} is replaced by {2,0,2,0}.
