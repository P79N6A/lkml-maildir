Hi Juan,
I have done everything I could do for this drive in the 2.2 series; this
tape is definitely not standard IDE tape drive, and before the latest
kernels we couldn't talk to it. We are now in the stage in which we can:
(1) Issue commands and read the drive's responses.
(2) perform a short (just a few megabytes) backup/restore.
(the crash when compiling the module statically in the kernel is easy
to fix -- the tape only responds with its capabilities when a media
is inserted and loaded by the drive, and the kernel probably booted
before that.)
I believe that we'll get it supported under Linux eventually, but
this might be a long process.
