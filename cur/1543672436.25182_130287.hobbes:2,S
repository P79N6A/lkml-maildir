Hi,
I seem to have a penguin missing in action, somewhere between 2.5.68 and
2.5.69.  Has anyone else lost a penguin under similar circumstances?
$ grep LOGO linux-sa1100/.config
CONFIG_LOGO=y
# CONFIG_LOGO_LINUX_MONO is not set
CONFIG_LOGO_LINUX_VGA16=y
CONFIG_LOGO_LINUX_CLUT224=y
Other than the missing logo, the fb display looks as it did under 2.5.68.
assabet$ fbset
mode "320x240-60"
        geometry 320 240 320 240 16
        timings 171521 61 9 3 0 5 1
        accel false
        rgba 5/11,6/5,5/0,0/0
endmode
