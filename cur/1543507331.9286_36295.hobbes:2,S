I just recently noticed that my parallel port is no longer behaving
correctly as far as the transfer mode goes.  Everything that uses the
parallel port is failing to communicate on EPP and dropping to PS2 (if
they have that option).  This problem appears to occur in 2.3.15 and the
last kernel I used 2.3.13.  Most kernels before that wouldn't compile or
had problems booting.  The last kernel that I ran where the transfer mode
negotiated correctly was 2.3.5.  Know whats going on?  Any additional info
I can provide?  No configuration (BIOS or kernel) has changed.
Part of the boot process showing ppa failing to use EPP, note that it
does establish communication with my zip drive, and the drive appears to
function normally except much more slowly:
parport0: PC-style at 0x378 (0x778) [PCSPP,TRISTATE,EPP,ECP]
parport0: irq 7 detected
parport0: cpp_mux: aa55f00f52ad51(87)
parport0: cpp_daisy: aa5500ff(80)
parport0: assign_addrs: aa5500ff(80)
ppa: Version 2.03 (for Linux 2.2.x)
ppa: Found device at ID 6, Attempting to use EPP 32 bit
ppa: Found device at ID 6, Attempting to use PS/2
ppa: Communication established with ID 6 using PS/2
