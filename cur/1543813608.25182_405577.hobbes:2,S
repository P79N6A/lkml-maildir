Well the original code used to have an heuristic to decide how much to 
prefetch at a time. It was considered opaque so I removed it. It made the 
amount to prefetch proportional to amount of ram which is wrong of course 
because it should depend more on swap partition read speed vs bus bandwidth 
or something. 
This way of deciding based on cpu load works anyway but yet again seems 
unpopular.
