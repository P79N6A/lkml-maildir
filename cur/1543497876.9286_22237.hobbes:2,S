They are often a lot less useful than across many machines. One machine
means "compiler ?, ram ? , corrupt build ?" 10 machines its rather unlikely
to be that
Im not sure if I saw your specific oopses (send me a set by all means and
note they are same machine). I have got a small pile of buffer/page cache
errors - including the truncate_inode_page one in 2.2.9ac* that say "Umm,
page/buffer cache race or scribble ??"
