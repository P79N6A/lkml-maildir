If this is the SHARP Shepherd (which seems to be the Zaurus SL-C750,
which looks like it's the one the submitter is using), it's not setting
boot_params at all:
	MACHINE_START(SHEPHERD, "SHARP Shepherd")
		.phys_io        = 0x40000000,
		.io_pg_offst    = (io_p2v(0x40000000) >> 18) & 0xfffc,
		.fixup          = fixup_corgi,
		.map_io         = pxa_map_io,
		.init_irq       = pxa25x_init_irq,
		.init_machine   = corgi_init,
		.timer          = &pxa_timer,
	MACHINE_END
