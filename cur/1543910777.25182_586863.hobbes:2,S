What do you think of the following? (And is there anyone else 
I should be cc-ing for review?)
Document semantics of dma_flags_set_dmaflush()

+Amend dir (one of the enum dma_data_direction values), with a platform-
+specific "dmaflush" attribute. Unless the platform supports "posted DMA" 
+this is a no-op. 
+
+On platforms that support posted DMA, dma_flags_set_dmaflush() causes 
+device writes to the associated memory region to flush in-flight DMA. 
+This can be important, for example, when (DMA) writes to the memory 
+region indicate that DMA of data is complete. If DMA of data and DMA of 
+the completion indication race, as they can do when the platform supports 
+posted DMA, then the completion indication may arrive in host memory 
+ahead of some data.
+
+To prevent this, you might map the memory region used for completion 
+indications as follows:
+
+	int count, flags = dma_flags_set_dmaflush(DMA_BIDIRECTIONAL);
+	.....
+	count = dma_map_sg(dev, sglist, nents, flags);
