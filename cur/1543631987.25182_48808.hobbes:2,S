Alan Cox responds to Gilad Ben-Yossef about licensing of Linux-based patents:

	You could license all programs that consist entirely of
free software.  That way, BSD, LGPL, and MPL software that did
not link in proprietary software would be allowed too, but your
example of a proprietary program that linked in the BSD'ed
libpatent.o/c would not be covered by this permission.
	Licensing all programs that consist entirely of free
software would address issues like GPL'ed software that contains
content that is GPL compatible but not GPL'ed, future versions of
the GPL, what happens if a court ruling opens a loophole in the
GPL, and practicing the patent with free software in other free
operating systems.
