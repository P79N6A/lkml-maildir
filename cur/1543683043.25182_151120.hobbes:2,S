Subject: NFS server broken in 2.4.22-pre6?

NFS serving seems to be broken in 2.4.22-pre6. I had 2 computers running
2.4.22-pre6 (x86, debian unstable current). Tried to acces them via NFS
(using am-utils actually) from a 3rd computer, IO error. Tried to
mount directly, mount: RPC: timed out. Rebooted one computer to 2.4.18
and NFS started to work.
No more details currently but I can test more thoroughly tomorrow.
