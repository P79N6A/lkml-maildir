These messages could indicate a timing problem.  You can see the code
that writes the messages near the end of wakeup_rh() in
drivers/usb/host/uhci-hcd.c.
The message gets written if the controller hardware hasn't turned off a 
particular bit after a 4-us delay.  If the udelay() function wasn't 
working right, it could cause this problem.
