Hi Mark,
I just want to second what Boris already stated.
Obviously your BIOS doesn't properly initialize your CPU.
Your BIOS programs the processor name string as
"AMD Processor model unknown"
I would have expected to see something like "AMD Phenom(tm) II X4"
This shows that the BIOS doesn't know your CPU model and it is an
indication that your CPU is not correctly initialized. Phenom II is a
different CPU model than Phenom and several configuration bits
(e.g. MSRs, CPU config space) need different settings from BIOS
or they even were reserved in previous family 10h CPU models.
IMHO it is a waste of time to try to debug/fix your problem from OS.
First you should update your BIOS. You need to check the "CPU
support"-information from your motherboard vendor to see whether your
motherboard supports Phenom II and which BIOS is required.
If you know that your BIOS/motherboard are supposed to support Phenom II
and the problem persists then it is a different game and we should
definitely look into your problem.
So what's your BIOS version and motherboard vendor/model?
(And output of dmidecode would be helpful.)

Andreas
