With 2 disks, the 5.5% sounds like an aweful lot. What block size were
the tests run with? To get the file system out of the way, you could run
something as simple as a dd on each device. That should show queueing
contention (which I guess is the prime area of contention) more
isolated. And profiles would still be very interesting to see :-)
