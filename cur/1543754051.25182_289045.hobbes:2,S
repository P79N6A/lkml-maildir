Yes I think I mentioned before this is a different machine than the 
pentiumM one. It's a P4HT3.06 with on board i810 sound and ext3 (which 
explains the vastly different DSP usage). The only "special" measure 
taken for jackd was to use the latest jackd code and the tmpfs mount you 
suggested. Looks like the number of steps to convert a modern "standard 
setup" desktop to a low latency one on linux aren't that big after all :)
