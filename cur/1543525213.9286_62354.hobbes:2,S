Hi,
I'm trying to write-protect a kernel page, for debugging purposes. I
want to get an oops when something (in ther kernel) tries to write to
it. Here is what I have (ptr points to the start of the page):
unsigned long address = (unsigned long)ptr;
pgd_t *src_pgd = pgd_offset_k(address);
pmd_t *src_pmd = pmd_offset(src_pgd, address);
pte_t *src_pte = pte_offset(src_pmd, address);
pte_t pte = *src_pte;
pte = pte_wrprotect(pte);
set_pte(src_pte, pte);
flush_tlb_all();
The problem is I can still write to the page after that. What am I
doing wrong? This is on a dual PIII machine, btw.
Thanks,
Borislav
