Disagree. All BUG_ON() stuff should read like:
/* check that impossible stuff didn't happen, move along, nothing to see */
BUG_ON(...);
Which is fine and good until the condition is actually doing more than
just sanity checking.

While I generally agree that "assertions" shouldn't have side-effects,
a slightly smarter smarty would make sure that BUG_ON evaluated its
condition. I have this in -tiny:
+#ifndef CONFIG_BUG
+#define BUG()
+#define WARN_ON(condition) do { if (condition) ; } while(0)
+#define BUG_ON(condition) do { if (condition) ; } while(0)
+#define PAGE_BUG(page)
+#else
