True.
However, I for one never run a -pre kernel.
I am unfortunately not wealthy, so am at the trailing edge of hardware 
(Athlon 550, P100 laptop, ...) so I rarely need devices only in the 
latest kernels.
I do however occasionally run new kernels on boxes at various times.
I don't run -pre, because rightly or wrongly, I've got the impression that
these get even less testing than releases.
I might well run -rcn kenrels, as these are presumably tested a little more,
and thought to be a little more stable.
This would help make me part of the solution, rather than part of the problem.
(complaining when 2.4.10 falls on it's face whenever something reads lots
of data say, or 2.4.11 has link problems)
