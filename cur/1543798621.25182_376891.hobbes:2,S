Dear Sir.
My name is Mr.Wang  Surat,a native of Banda Aceh, Indonesia.I got your information while 
browsing the internet in search of a reliable person that will assist me because of the 
problem my family have last time during the EarthQuake in Tsunami on December 2004.
My family were killed during the Asian Tsunami Disaster on 26 December 2004 and right 
now i am at Australian Military Hospital in Banda Aceh seek for your assitance for my 
father,s waelth because as soon as i get well from the hospital, i will not like to stay or live
in asia any more as i don,t have any family here,This is because after the death of my 
family,I inherited all my father buisness and wealth.I was a Gold dealer in Deira "GOLD 
SOUK"meaning gold market in Sri Lanka. 
At present, I am suffering from a long-time cancer of the brain and from all indications, my 
condition is realy deteriorating because doctor'e report shows that i may not live beyond 
six months from now.
So, I now decided to divide part of this wealth by contributing to the well being of the less 
privileged and handicapped around the world.
This mission which no doubt is very tasking had made me to recently relocate from my 
family house to Sri Lanka where I live at present so i can avoid pressure and distraction 
from the shock. I selected you for this Purpose and prayed over it. At first, I did not know 
how to put up this request for asistance because I have been recieving scam mails from 
AFRICA.
However I feel I can trust you and I am willing to donate the sum of $9,800,000.00 Million 
US Dollars to you for the development and well being of the handicapped and less 
privileged around your country.I have also decided to map out  35% of this total sum  for 
your own personal expenses in the course of this work.
Please note that, this fund is currently deposited with a Finance organisation,But I can 
ask my Attorney to help file an immediate application for the transfer of the money in your 
name to your account.
Futheremore, if you are willing to assit me on this request, Please kindly reply to me, 
Secondly,do not reply me if you have the intention of using this fund for personal use,
other that what is mearnt for.
Lastly, I want you/family home to be praying for me as regards my entire life and my health
because I have come to find out since my spiritual birth lately that wealth acquisition with 
out God, one's life is vanity upon vanity.
I await your urgent reply
REMAIN BLESSED.
Mr.Surat Wang
