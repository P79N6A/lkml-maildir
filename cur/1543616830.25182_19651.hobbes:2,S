It allows me to del^W read NFS-mounted mail behind a linux router while I 
copy files locally on the router. If I don't apply mini-ll to the router, 
it's a "server foo not responding, still trying" fest. You know what
"interactivity feel" means when it happens.
If someone suspects the hardware is crap, it's a PIV motherboard with 
built-in Promise20265 and four IBM IC35L060AVER07-0 on their own channel.
Each disk has been able to behave normally during RAID1 rebuild.
Without mini-ll:
  well choosen file I/O => no file I/O, no networking, no console, *big pain*.
With mini-ll:
  well choosen file I/O => *only* those I/O suck (less than before btw).
