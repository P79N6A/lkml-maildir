I have these:
# lspci|grep Brook
00:09.0 Multimedia video controller: Brooktree Corporation Bt878 Video 
Capture (rev 11)
00:09.1 Multimedia controller: Brooktree Corporation Bt878 Audio Capture 
(rev 11)
And this card (hauppagge wintv) works fine with 2.4 but doesn't work (at 
least for long...) in vanilla 2.6.0-test1 -> test3. I'll try a newer 
kernel shortly :-)
I also have a nvidia card but I don't have any nvidia drivers installed.
One more note: in my setup I must use "NoMTRR":
Section "Screen"
         Identifier      "Default Screen"
         Device          "nVidia Corporation [NV15]"
         Monitor         "Generic Monitor"
         Option          "NoMTRR"
... etc...
Or I'll get screen corruption sooner or later.
Good luck,
Nuno Silva
