But they are not the same.
 - "__" means this variable will be the same size across the
   kernel/userspace boundry.
 - without the "__" means this variable will only be this size within
   the kernel.
Use "__" for variables being seen by userspace.  Otherwise use the
types without "__".
Hope this helps,
