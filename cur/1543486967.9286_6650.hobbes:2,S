For what its worth, I'm using the first partition, not the fourth, and
I'm not doing "dd/cp" I'm doing "tar czvf".  I'm also using EPP 16 bit
(how do I change this? I presume its a module option) And it happens
every time.  I've only just got the zip, so it's just possible I'm
doing something "gifted".
