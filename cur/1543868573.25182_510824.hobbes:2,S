Vincent,
thanks for the output. Is this really the full output? The important part 
- report descriptor dump - seems to be missing in the output (it should 
read something like "hid-core.c: report descriptor (size XY, read YZ) = 
... some hexadecimal numbers". This should be output by the time the HID 
device is connected.
This output is generated in usb_hid_configure() function in hid-core.c
