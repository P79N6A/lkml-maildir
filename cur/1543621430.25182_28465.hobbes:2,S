Speaking as a proud member of Al Viro's killfile (from one work account and 
one home accounts, each time for lkml postings he wasn't cc:'d on, which 
somehow set him off anyway), I really doubt he perceives lack of 
communication as much of a problem.  More of a solution. :)
Seeing a conspiracy in the existence of any posts to public mailing lists 
other than linux-kernel is, however, the kind of paranoia for which 
medication is prescribed.  (Would the reactionary front have preferred Eric 
email the various developers directly in a big CC:, instead of a posting to a 
PUBLIC LIST, which apparently Jeff DID find and highlighted?  I'd say the 
"help help this is being repressed" came at the start of this thread, not 
when Eric jumped in.)
And when did talking to Linus directly (in email or on the phone) become 
something that Linus needed to be protected from?  (Look out guys!  Some 
people are thinking of TALKING DIRECTLY TO LINUS!  Without consulting us 
first!  They must be found and stopped!)
And here I thought Linus was very good at saying no, in a multitude of 
contexts...
