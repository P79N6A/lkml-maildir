Well by my reasoning you should, if possible, define some usefull
standards that will allow te reuse of these dictionaries within other
applications.
And while we're on the subject of whats IN or OUT, (and I'll bet if you
ask 10 kernel developers you'll get 10 answers but I try anyway ;)
In my philosophy the OS (kernel + device drivers) is an abstraction of
the machine, it should present the 'machine' in such a way that allows
for other abstractions such as a word processor to operate without having
to know the specifics of hardware devices.
To have a guideline on the 7 segments notation and to have a few defines
that allow ASCII chars to be represented on 7 segments displays also help
to support the 'machine' abstraction.
Wheter or not /usr/dict/words should be 'in the kernel' is not being
discussed here, so I am not going to elaborate on that.
Cheers,
