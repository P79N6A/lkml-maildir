Greetings,
I am trying to get the hpt372 ide to work (not as a raid).
I have tried 2.4.19 and with patch-2.4.20-pre11.
On boot, 'ide: lost interrupt' is printed, although the hpt372
is detected.  Partitions on ide can be mounted but soon
fail with busy errors.
I tried Highpoints Linux driver. This seems to work but
uses the scsi interface. Other messages in the archive
suggest that the 372 should work.
Anybody got this to work?
TIA.
