Because the firmware is stored in volitile memory on the card, and
vanishes on a card reset or removal, and I would like to have it Just
Work with the pcmcia-cs package with minimal changes.
Having to remember "run this userspace tool after every card reset"
(which includes power suspends and so forth) would be a major pain.
Besides, the card already has a good validator in it.
