I had to deal with this in my procstate patch (was against RH 2.4 with O(1)
sched but not 2.6).  What I chose to do (and what the people who were
wanting the code wanted) was to move tasks which had no CPU to run upon onto
an unrunnable list.  Whenever a CPU's state is changed, scan the list.
Whenevr a task's affinity mask is changed, check if it needs to go onto or
come off of the unrunnable_list.
I added a new TASK_UNRUNNABLE state for these tasks, too.  By adding the
task's current (or most recent) CPU and the task's cpus_allowed and
cpus_allowed_mask to /proc/pid/status, we gave simple tools for finding
these unrunnable tasks.
I think the sanest thing for a CPU removal is to migrate everything off the
processor in question, move unrunnable tasks into TASK_UNRUNNABLE state,
then notify /sbin/hotplug.  The hotplug script can then find and handle the
unrunnable tasks.  No SIGPWR grossness needed.
Code against 2.4 at

 - it was
heavily tested and I *think* it is all correct (for that kernel snapshot).
