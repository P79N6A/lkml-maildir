It mustn't be zero!  The page is *known* to be in the pagecache,
so its count must be at least 1.

yup.  You can stick an
	if (page_count(page) == 0)
		BUG();
at the top of truncate_list_pages...
Actually it might help to add some extra checks to
page_cache_release():
1: If the page is in the pagecache, that's one.
2: If the page has buffers, that's another.
so 
  void page_cache_release(struct page *page)  
  {
+	int expected = 0;
+
+	if (page->buffers)
+		expected++;
+	if (page->mapping) {
+		if (!list_empty(page->list))
+			BUG();
+		expected++;
+	}
+
+	expected++;	/* The caller has a ref too */
+
+	if (page_count(page) < expected)
+		BUG();
+
        if (!PageReserved(page) && put_page_testzero(page)) {
                if (PageLRU(page))
                        lru_cache_del(page);
                __free_pages_ok(page, 0);
        }
  }
The list_empty() check will require that remove_page_from_inode_queue()
use list_del_init() instead of list_del().
The above code (untested, and racy as hell on SMP and preempt) may
catch whoever is droppng the refcount at the wrong time.
