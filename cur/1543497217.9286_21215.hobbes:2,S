   The problem is that the video memory size detection routines in mdacon.c
are not 100% reliable. I've already seen several bug reports on this and it
seems we'll have to add a optional parameter to override the size. I want
vgacon (being the default console driver on PC's) to work perfectly with
all cards, even if it means scrollback being unsupported on the HGC.
   Anyway, we might try adding a command-line option for specifying the
size manually or just detect HGC and assume minimum memory size possible
for a HGC. This (and setting vga_hardscroll_enable to 1) should be enough
to get a working hardware scrolling and scrollback.

   Current situation is:
	o  vgacon supports MDA, HGC, EGA and VGA cards, but can be
	   loaded only once.
	o  mdacon supports MDA/HGC as a secondary display, but it can be
	   also configured to take over the videocard and replace vgacon.
   It would be nice to have one driver which could be loaded multiple
times, but it isn't trivial to implement.

   It's probably because of poor shielding of the sound card :-(
				Have a nice fortnight
