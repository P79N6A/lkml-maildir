From my point of view, this kind of changes can keep compatability and be done
in small chunks if you do something like
typedef struct inode inode_t;
typedef struct super_block super_block_t;
so old code still builds, new code can use new types and you can patch
code smoothly. And you can grep-r for both usages in the tree.
But all is a matter of preferences. I found it cleaner. Some people
hate the _t suffix. Many people prefer explicit 'struct' than opaque
types. And so on...
