and in Linux.  The fact that there is a buffer cache used for some parts
of the write path doesn't stop us keeping the page cache consistent at
all times.  In 2.3, the two paths will use the same memory anyway.

Agreed, that's what is required by Unix file semantics.  The
cache-to-disk synchronisation semantics are much more relaxed.  Lazy
batching of the metadata transactions on disk is perfectly legal on
Unix.
