Yep x % y where y isnt constant could result in a divide which will blow
away 60+ cycles on some ppc machines. You can do a whole lot in those 60
cycles. Many memcpys for example :)
We removed all modulo arithmetic in the e1000 driver (replaced it with
if (x > y) x = 0) and managed to measure an improvement.
