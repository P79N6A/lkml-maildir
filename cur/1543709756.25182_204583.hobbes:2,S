Subject: (2.6 IDE) why PDC202XX_FORCE not allowed with BLK_DEV_PDC202XX_NEW=m?

PDC202XX_FORCE option is needed to override controller disable by BIOS
when RAID is used. Or maybe there is another way to do this in 2.6.x?
This option has "depends on BLK_DEV_PDC202XX_NEW=y" flag in
drivers/ide/Kconfig, thus is not available with pdc202xx_new in
module - why?
I saw success report with modular pdc202xx_new after this simple change
(without PDC202XX_FORCE controller ports were not detected):

          Enable the PDC202xx controller even if it has been disabled in the BIOS setup.
The same may apply to PDC202XX_BURST for pdc202xx_old module...
(but not tested)
