Hi Ingo,
Tests were executed in the following conditions:
"Taking Linux 2.6.23-rc6 + 2.6.23-rc6-mm1 as a basis, I took some sample 
runs of the following on both it and after applying Mathieu Desnoyers 
11-patch sequence (19 September 2007).
   * 32-way IA64 + 132GiB + 10 FC adapters + 10 HP MSA 1000s (one 72GiB
     volume per MSA used)"
Even though the 19 Sept. 2007 markers were released with dependency on
immediate values, there are no optimized immediate values currently
available on ia64. Therefore, we add a d-cache hit for every marker
until we merge immediate values and implement the ia64 optimization.
