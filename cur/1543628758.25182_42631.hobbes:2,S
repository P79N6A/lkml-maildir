Hi,
I can not mount a working free bsd file system, with
2.4.19-pre2 and 2.4.19-pre4-ac4  not sure for other
version.
#mount -t ufs /dev/hda6 /mnt/disk/
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on
/dev/hda6,  or too many mounted file systems
Run fdisk
Disk /dev/hda: 255 heads, 63 sectors, 1245 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 bytes
   Device Boot    Start       End    Blocks   Id 
System
/dev/hda1             1         9     72261   82 
Linux swap
/dev/hda2   *        10       227   1751085    b 
Win95 FAT32
/dev/hda3           228       355   1028160   83 
Linux
/dev/hda4           356      1245   7148925   a5 
BSD/386
Command (m for help):
I tried all mount options, ro, ufstype=44bsd  etc  but
all I got is the same messaage
did anyone see it before? What should I do to read
from this partition from Linux, as u can see this is
the bigest one, and I dont want to delete the whole
freebsd by now, at least until they (freebsd people)
have fixes the i810 audio driver so I can test again.
At the moment I have to boot freebsd to transfer files
from ext2 between...
Thanks in advance.
