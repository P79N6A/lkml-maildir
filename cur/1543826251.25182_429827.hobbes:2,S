could you please apply the following patches ontop of -mm3:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/lockdep-patches/lockdep-combo-2.6.17-rc5-mm3.patch
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/lockdep-patches/lockdep-tracer-2.6.17-rc5-mm3.patch
accept all the default 'make oldconfig' options and reboot into the 
patched kernel. If everything goes well then the system should still 
boot up fine and you should still get the lockdep warning - but this 
time there should be a long trace in /proc/latency_trace. Please upload 
that trace - it gives us the kernel's function trace, leading up to the 
warning.
