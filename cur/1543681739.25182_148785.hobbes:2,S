Apply this patch and rebooting with this new kernel made no difference.
I tried a few more things as well:
Disconnect CD-ROM: Same problem as before.
Boot with 'ide0=autotune': Same problem as before
I was e-mailed a suggestion to try booting with 'noapic', and that
didn't help either. I'm currently running the patched kernel booted with
the 'ide=nodma' argument.
As things just go to pieces when reading the hard drive, maybe someone
knows if this hard drive model has known DMA issues. When starting the
machine the screens before my lilo prompt print out that the hard drive
should do UDMA. The hard drive on the ide1 channel seems to present no
problem to the ALi controller. Here is agin the hdparm info on my
troublesome drive:
$ hdparm -I /dev/hda

This hard drive is from 1996/1997; it is the original hard drive I built
this machine with. The 'Standards' line above looks odd - a clue
perhaps?
The second hard drive I added about 3 years ago. Here is info on it:

If the hard drives seem to be alright, maybe there is some sort of BIOS
thing I should try? I've poked around in the BIOS setup numerous times
but never found anything that I could change and make things work.
