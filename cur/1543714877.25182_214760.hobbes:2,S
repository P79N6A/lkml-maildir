Guys, this tends to indicate that we _must_ have up to date aging
information from the PTE - if not, we're liable to miss out on the
pressure from user applications.  The "lazy" method which 2.4 will
allow is not possible with 2.6.
This means we must flush the TLB when we mark the PTE old.
Might be worth reading my thread on linux-mm about this and commenting?
