Since when has "default" been anything but "default". It doesn't mean that 
you can't override it. And if "make oldconfig" doesn't take the _old_ 
setting into account over the new one, there's something wrong.
Of course, if there is no actual question, "default" ends up being what it 
always chosen (because no explicit choice is allowed), but in this case 
we're talking about:
	bool "Macintosh device drivers"
which definitely has that question.
