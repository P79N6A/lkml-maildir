RFC: Update coding standard to avoid split up printk format strings
Common occurrence: You see some error message in the kernel log you don't
understand, Standard way to handle this is to grep the kernel source code 
for that error message and then look at the code and figure out what
is wrong from that.
Unfortunately that is often far more difficult than needed because 
with the strict 80 character limit printk format strings are often split up
over multiple lines. One example for this would be
	  printk(KERN_CRIT "protocol %04x is "
                          "buggy, dev %s\n",
                          skb2->protocol, dev->name);
from net/core/dev.c. If you see this obscure message what would you grep
for? "protocol.*is buggy" will not find it and "is buggy" neither and "buggy"
or "protocol" gives you a zillion of hits that you have review all
by hand. All quite unsatisfactory.
Worse the coding standard actually recommends to split up printks like
this, but I think it is one of the most counter0productive suggestions it
has.
There are two reasonable ways to handle this. Either put the format 
string on an own line with backwards indentation or ignore the column 80
limitation. I think both are better actually than having ungreppable
error messages.
This patch updates the coding standard for to allow this.
Of course it only applies to the printk format string, any other 
printk arguments should be still split up over multiple lines as before.
That is fine because they rarely need to be grepped for.
I expect this proposal will likely be somewhat controversal and I don't expect
universal agreement (and it's likely a bike shed paint topic like
all coding standard issues); but let's see what happens.
I think it would be a valuable improvement of the coding standard.
At some point checkpatch.pl would need to be updated to know about this
exception too, that would be the next step.

+It is not recommended to break printk format strings into smaller strings.
+The problem with doing this is that it makes it much harder to grep
+for the error messages in the source if they are split up over multiple
+lines. And grepping for error messages is fairly important for debugging.
+So for the special case of printk format strings (or formatting any other
+user visible error message) the normal 80 character column rule
+does not apply. Or alternatively it is ok to violate the indentation
+rule for the format string only if that makes the end not exceed
+80 characters. For example
+
+void function(void)
+{
+	if (...) {
+		if (...) {
+			printk(
+ "very very long formatting string with argument %d and argument %d\n",
+				a, b);

+	}
 }
 
+You should still break up the further printk arguments if they exceed 80
+characters though.
