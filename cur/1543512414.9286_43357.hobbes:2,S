Subject: 2.3.20 will not boot

Having upgraded to 2.3.20, linux seems to be oops'ing immediately on
boot. Unfortunately the screen scolls so quickly that I cannot see the
original error message. I see the initial "loading" message then I
think I see a register dump scroll off the screen. When it settles
down, all I see are entries of the form "[<123456abcd>]" being
displayed very rapidly on the screen with the disk access light on. I
have tried configuring console to lineprinter, but the printer
displays nothing - so it looks as though the problem is happening
before the output could be sent to the printer.
There is nothing in any of the log files for the aborted boot attempts.
My system is a 120MHz pentium, 64Mbyte Ram, with a PIIX3 Ide
controller.
I have tried with various block device options (eg with or without dma
etc)
This is the first boot failure I have encountered (having used all
previous 2.3.x kernels.
Is there any way I can get more information which would help locate
the problem?
