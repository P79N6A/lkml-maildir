The part about automatically reloading the table with an error map and forcing 
it to resume. It just seemed to me that user-space ought to be able to gather 
enough information to determine that a device needed to be resumed before it 
could be removed. Thus the kernel driver wouldn't be forced to implement such 
a policy.
Talking with Alasadair again, he mentioned a case I hadn't considered. Devices 
would now be created without a mapping and initially suspended. If some other 
error occurred, and you decided to just delete the device before loading a 
mapping, it would fail.  And having to resume a device with no mapping just 
to be able to delete it definitely seems odd.
So, it's not like I'm dead-set against this idea. I was just curious what the 
reasoning was behind this change.
