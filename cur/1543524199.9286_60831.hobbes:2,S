hello all,
	could anybody suggest about  Threads implementation which 
implements the entire POSIX threads std. 1003.1c.i for linux. hope that
threads	package(Xavier Leroy threads) which is a default part of the 
Red hat 6.0 kernel version 2.2.5-15 linux distribution  does not implement 
the entire spec. for example it's mutex implementation does not have 
priority inheritance/ceiling properties.
thanks in advance
