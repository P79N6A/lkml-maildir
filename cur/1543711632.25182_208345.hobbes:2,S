Ok, splitting hairs, for the coherent contiguous case, what about:
int dma_coherent_map(struct vm_area_struct *vma, void *cpu_addr,
		     dma_addr_t dma_addr, size_t size);
and x86 would be:
#define dma_coherent_map(vma,cpu_addr,dma_addr,size)	\
	remap_page_range(vma, vma->vm_start, __pa(cpu_addr), \
			 size, vma->vm_page_prot)
This then leaves the PCI BAR case and the DMA coherent SG buffer case,
though neither of those fall within my personal problem space at present.
