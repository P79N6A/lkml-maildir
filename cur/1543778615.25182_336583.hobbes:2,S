When we recover our history from the linuxppc-2.4/2.5 trees we can
show exactly how long it's been since anybody touched ep405.
Quick googling shows that it's been almost 2 years since the last
mention of ep405 (exluding removal discussions) on linuxppc-embedded.
Last ep405-related commits are more than 2 years ago.
