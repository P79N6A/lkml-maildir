An Amiga should (at least theoretically) run with an ftp.kernel.org 
kernel and the configuration you get with amiga_defconfig.
The same goes for all other platforms you mention.
There is a window between support for a platform being developed and it 
entering the main kernel tree, but that should only be a short window.
And in case a platform support stays long-term only in an external tree 
that's nothing that requires documentation - that's a problem that 
should be fixed.
