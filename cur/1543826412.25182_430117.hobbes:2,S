I don't think there is such a convention that's generic for PCI.  There might
be ACPI-specific tables holding that value, but on embedded hardware the model
is often that the arch/.../board-ZZZ.c file just "knows" things like how much
power the regulator powering that port can provide, and arranges bus_mA to match.
Just like it knows all sorts of other details about how that board works.
