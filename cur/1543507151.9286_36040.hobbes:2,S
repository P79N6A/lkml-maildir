And you'll lose 4mbyte of virtual addresses. We are very strict in the
4giga of virtual address space and we must be careful to not waste it.
To access a piece of memory with a uncached-pte you can use a
kmap_uncached() that maybe a variant of a plain kmap(). kmap() will avoid
you to waste lots virtual address space by using the per-CPU virtual
addresses allocated in the fixmap area. You'll have only to run an invlpg
before accessing the data (after updating the pte). See the bigmem patch
for more details.
