Quoting the "silence gcc warning" thread:
"Really, this is a gcc bug.  My version of the compiler:
gcc version 4.0.3 20051201 (prerelease) (Debian 4.0.2-5)
Doesn't give this warning.  And, since the loop has fixed parameters,
gcc should see not only that it's always executed, but that it could be
unrolled."
