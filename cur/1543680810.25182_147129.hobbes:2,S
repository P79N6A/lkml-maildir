Hi all...
Any brave soul there is using a prerelease of gcc-3.3.1 to build kernels ?
(don't know if RawHide or SuSE beta or any other have that, apart from
MandrakeCooker).
I have tried both with 22-pre2 and 22-pre4 and both hang. They
can not start /sbin/init (or at least hang there). Once I got to
a bash prompt with init=/bin/bash, and ls listed everything _twice_ and
then hung.
Any idead about what pice of code is being miscompiled ?
