It was a long time ago.. 2.4.early, perhaps.
There was a place (maybe in the select() code) where we were doing
copy_*_user() while in state TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE.  And iirc there was a
place in the pagefault code which did schedule().  So we would occasionally
hit schedule() in state TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE, when we expected to be in state
TASK_RUNNING.
So we made handle_mm_fault() set TASK_RUNNING to prevent any further such
things.
