Most of the VM stuff in those directories that you're referring to are
old, crusty exports, from the days before _GPL.  We've left them to be
polite, but if many of them were recreated today, they'd certainly be
_GPL.
We do not want random external modules poking at PTEs, nor should a
module need to know such kernel internals as the semantics of
PTE_HIGHMEM.  I think it needs _GPL.
BTW, your new patches look much nicer than the last set.  Thanks for
making the changes I suggested.
