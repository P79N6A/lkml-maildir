The limiting factor is usually disk bandwidth, seek latency, rotational
latency.  That's why I want to know your bandwidth.

I don't find lockmeter very useful.  Here's oprofile output for 2.5.23:
c013ec08 873      1.07487     rmqueue                 
c018a8e4 950      1.16968     do_get_write_access     
c013b00c 969      1.19307     kmem_cache_alloc_batch  
c018165c 1120     1.37899     ext3_writepage          
c0193120 1457     1.79392     journal_add_journal_head 
c0180e30 1458     1.79515     ext3_prepare_write      
c0136948 6546     8.05969     generic_file_write      
c01838ac 42608    52.4606     .text.lock.inode      
So I lost two CPUs on the BKL in fs/ext3/inode.c.  The remaining
two should be enough to saturate all but the most heroic disk
subsystems.
A couple of possibilities come to mind:
1: Processes which should be submitting I/O against disk "A" are
   instead spending tons of time asleep in the page allocator waiting
   for I/O to complete against disk "B".
2: ext3 is just too slow for the rate of data which you're trying to
   push at it.   This exhibits as lock contention, but the root cause
   is the cost of things like ext3_mark_inode_dirty().  And *that*
   is something we can fix - can shave 75% off the cost of that.
Need more data...

Have you tried *any* other fs?
