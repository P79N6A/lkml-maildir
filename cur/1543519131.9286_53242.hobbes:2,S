He is totally right.The DRE (Direct rendering engine) in
drivers/sgi/char/graphics.c is severly broken. First is the thread problem
he is discussing. If you have a app that uses DRE that creates three
threads and each thread preforms a different graphics operation. The
first thread will cause the page fault. The second and third thread
will NOT which is required for DRE to work right. Another problem here is 
that if the other process (the one which owns the mapping) is threaded,
and if the g_user task dies leaving other threads running, then there will
be no callback to unmap that page --- the threaded application still has
the mapping.  However, this leaves g_user pointing to an invalid task.
Also for the "solutions" now being presents to handle graphics on linux
requires a good amount of change to a threaded OpenGL library to handle
userland locking and unlocking. 
I'm working on fixing DRE for linux. The above issue is being delt with 
by me. I haven't setup the web page yet but a mailing list is avaliable
http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/linuxgfx-dev.
 Code is
avaliable by CVS. The page with all the links is at
