The box locked up while running bonnie++ with the patch.
One difference was without the patch, it printed the
"this should not happen" 9 times.  With the patch, it printed
54 times (6 times more), if that's any kind of clue.
I'm trying Eric's suggestion to change QLOGICFC_REQ_QUEUE_LEN
from 127 to 255 on top of your patch.
