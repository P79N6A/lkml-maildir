  But you can make a hard link to a file in reiser4, and you can
  access the metadata in both. I did this test:
  echo "moooo" > test
  ln test moo
  chmod +x moo test
  echo "0700" > test/metas/rwx
  dir moo test
      -rwx------  2 root root 10 Sep  7 23:17 moo*
      -rwx------  2 root root 10 Sep  7 23:17 test*
      
  echo "0777" > test/metas/rwx
  dir moo test
      -rwxrwxrwx  2 root root 10 Sep  7 23:17 moo*
      -rwxrwxrwx  2 root root 10 Sep  7 23:17 test*
      
  rm moo test
  mkdir test
  ln test moo
      ln: `test': hard link not allowed for directory
  If this is the intended behaviour I do not know, but it shows that
  hard links works as normal.
  You can also do linking to meta-data:
  echo moo > moo
  ln -s moo/metas/rwx test
  dir
      -rwxrwxrwx   1 root    root      0 Sep  7 23:24 moo*
      lrwxrwxrwx   1 root    root     13 Sep  7 23:25 test -> moo/metas/rwx
  echo 0700 > test
  dir moo
      -rwx------   1 root    root      0 Sep  7 23:24 moo*
