ok, so I guess you're doing the growsdown by hand in the uml sigsegv
handler.
So it's probably fine to allow GROWSDOWN only on anon vmas per Linus's
suggestion. I can attempt to change the race fix that way.
However about last Linus's suggestion it's not obvious to me that
dropping GROWSDOWN/UP completly and forcing a fixed virtual size of the
stack [modulo rlimit of course] is a good idea, because:
1) on 32bit platforms having big vma for the stack means reducing the
   space for the dynamic mappings
2) I love not to have a virtual stack limit for software making use of
   aggressive recursion.
The gap logic is very simple too.
