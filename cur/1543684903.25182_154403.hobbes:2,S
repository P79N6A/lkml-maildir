Excellent!

Sounds reasonable.  Except doing a boot/halt cycle on the simulator
should be easy to automate, no?  The simulator can actually catch a
surprising number of problems.

Nothing in particular, though it would be good to cover UP, MP, 16,
and 64KB page sizes (not in all permutations, of course).
