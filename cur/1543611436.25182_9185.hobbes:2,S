Hungarian notation???
That was developed by programmers with apparently no skill to
see/remember how a variable is defined.  IMHO in the Linux community
it's widely considered one of the worst coding styles possible.

yes

We could definitely use a ton more comments... patches accepted.

use a decent editor

not all variable names need their purpose obvious to complete newbies. 
sometimes it takes time to understand the code's purpose, in which case
the variable names become incredibly descriptive.

yes
