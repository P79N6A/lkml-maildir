It should work if you're running an 'rpc.statd' daemon. The Linux
kernel does not support so-called 'unmonitored' locking, hence both
the client and the server need to be running a statd process. This
ensures that if the server (client) reboots, then all remote locks are
reclaimed by the client (released by the server).
