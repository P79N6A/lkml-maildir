Because I can steal the code from FRV's semaphores or rw-semaphores, and this
way I can be sure of what I'm doing.
Note that the sleeping processes are generally dequeued and dispatched by the
up() function, which means they don't have to take the spinlock themselves.
This may be possible to do magically with the waitqueue stuff, but I'm not sure
how to do it; it's horribly complicated to read through the sources and there
isn't much documentation.
