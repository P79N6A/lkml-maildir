Hello World,
I'm using the nVidia binary drivers (yes, I know that I should not use
them, but I need them if I want to play games like UT2003).
They work with kernel 2.4.18, but I got kernel hangs with 2.4.20. I have
submitted this bug to nVidia and wanted to ask here, what changes have
been made in the kernel 2.4.20 that may cause this problems.
Thanks and best regards
	Andreas
