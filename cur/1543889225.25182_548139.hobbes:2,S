i'm pleased to announce release -v14 of the CFS scheduler patchset.
The CFS patch against v2.6.22-rc2, v2.6.21.1 or v2.6.20.10 can be 
downloaded from the usual place:

In -v14 the biggest user-visible change is increased sleeper fairness 
(done by Mike Galbraith and myself), which results in better 
interactivity under load. In particular 3D apps such as compiz/Beryl or 
games benefit from it and should be less sensitive to other apps running 
in parallel to them - but plain X benefits from it too.
CFS is converging nicely, with no regressions reported against -v13. 
Changes since -v13:
 - increase sleeper-fairness (Mike Galbraith, me)
 - kernel/sched_debug.c printk argument fixes for ia64 (Andrew Morton)
 - CFS documentation fixes (Pranith Kumar D)
 - increased the default rescheduling granularity to 3msecs on UP,
   6 msecs on 2-way systems
 - small update_curr() precision fix
 - added an overview section to Documentation/sched-design-CFS.txt
 - misc cleanups
As usual, any sort of feedback, bugreport, fix and suggestion is more 
than welcome!
	Ingo
