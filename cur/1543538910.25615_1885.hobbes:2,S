   Except it will cost us time and stability. Where do you draw the line?
   Or even better: when will 2.4 be really, really, *really* released?
I have to agree with Richard here.  If we do this, it'll set back 2.4 by
at least month (and I may be conservative here).  There will *always* be
more places where we can do more/better fine-grained locking.  Where
indeed do we draw the line, and do we really want to be doing this while
we're at 2.4.0-test*?!?
If we were still accepting stuff like this, we shouldn't have moved the
verison number to 2.3.99 or 2.4.0testn.
