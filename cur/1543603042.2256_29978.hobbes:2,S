We need to distinguish between Linux/Apache and other-UNIX/Apache.
Specifically, there's at least Solaris, Tru64 and AIX besides Linux in this
market. It isn't just IIS; the Nimda beast exploited, IIRC, 18 separate
vulnerabilities in the Windows / IIS complex, including shared files.
I've actually heard of cases where *Linux* systems exporting filesystems
with Samba had Nimda code stuffed down their throats! If this code had been
Linux-executable rather than Windows-executable -- if the virus had been
smart enough to know it was dealing with a Samba rather than a Windows share
and had been able to differentiate between Windows executables and Linux
executables -- hmmm ... do you see what I'm getting at??? In other words,
UNIX systems of *all* stripes that export filesystems with Samba need to
track mods to executables just like a virus scanner does on a Windows
system. *That's* what I mean by vigilance.

The security features are there in Windows if the users and sysadmins are
willing to implement them. Windows NT has had C2 available for quite some
time; they couldn't sell to DOD if they didn't. A good MSCE / security
specialist makes a lot of money. It's for the most part laziness on the part
of Windows users that allows malicious code to circulate, not any inherent
weakness in the Microsoft tool set. The technology exists.

I don't see any such advantage. C2 is C2; crypto is crypto; authentication
is authentication; vigilance is vigilance.
Here, for your amusement, is a snippet of Perl code:
$stuff = `uname`;
if ($stuff =~ /is not recognized as an internal or external command,/ {
	# execute malicious Windows code
}
else {
	# look at the uname stuff and figure out what OS we're running
	# then execute OS-specific malicious code
}
Do you see what I'm saying?
