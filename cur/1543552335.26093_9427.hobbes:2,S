I think everyone who first writes here and hasn´t read the archives asks
this...
This is a technical mailinglist ... If you have technical comments which
are welcome, you are welcome otherwise go to play.

Yeah 16 year old calling himself a programmer ... Ever heard about
programming theory OS design theory?? Ok alan (-> Alan Cox ...) says
that there is a HUGE difference between theory and practise...

Yes, and pre-emptive _is_ better because one cannot rely on the user
being sensitive ...
especially script kiddies like you ...

Ehhm as modules run in kernel nearly everything is accessible for em ...

modules it is because its well thought of...

Nope the API is developed with the kernel ... And its really easy to
design a device driver ... Try it ... look at the joystick driver... for
a start ...

Wepp- run em all in seperate memspaces and do context switches all the
time which is one of the most time consuming tasks on a cpu ... (saving
and restoring a whole register set ...)

Amiga design is *old* ... Windows is relatively old QNX is hacked to fit
onto a floppy and it is a RTOS for you who doesnt know: Real Time
Operating System, Real time means that the OS has to respond to requests
in a certain time which is well defined ( could also be 1 second, but
the OS has to guarantee that it will handle any request in the worst
case in 1 second (latency) which is highly unrealistic (1 sec) There are
linux low-latency patches which make linux more responsible (probably
what you call "speed")
Linux does fit on a floppy too (there are enough tars you can
download...
