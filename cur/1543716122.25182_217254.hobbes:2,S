You need to run "e2fsck -f /dev/sda7" on the unmounted filesystem.  There
is some sort of corruption there.

This earlier error should have forced a full fsck - did that run?

This seems a bit ominous, not sure how bad it really is.

Hmm, so it did run.  It seems you are getting corruption on the disk for
some reason.

Was this after the e2fsck was run?  It shouldn't be marked "with errors".
