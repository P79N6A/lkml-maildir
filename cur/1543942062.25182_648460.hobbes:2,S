OK, attached data collected on 2.6.24-9ef9dc69d4167276c04590d67ee55de8380bc1ad
with CONFIG_PCI_DEBUG=y with and without your patch:
(-000 means vanilla, -001 means with reverted patch)
-rw-r--r-- 1 ad ad 25261 2008-02-05 12:08 tg3-000.dmesg
-rw-r--r-- 1 ad ad  1112 2008-02-05 12:08 tg3-000.iomem
-rw-r--r-- 1 ad ad 37785 2008-02-05 12:08 tg3-000.lspci
-rw-r--r-- 1 ad ad 25495 2008-02-05 12:08 tg3-001.dmesg
-rw-r--r-- 1 ad ad  1172 2008-02-05 12:08 tg3-001.iomem
-rw-r--r-- 1 ad ad 37933 2008-02-05 12:08 tg3-001.lspci
dmesg is full of such chunks:
-  got res [180000000:180ffffff] bus [180000000:180ffffff] flags 200 for BAR 0 of 0000:03:04.0
+  got res [180000000:180ffffff] bus [80000000:80ffffff] flags 200 for BAR 0 of 0000:03:04.0
which is definitely not difference in formatting.
