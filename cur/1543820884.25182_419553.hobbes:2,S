How about if I set up an automated email drop - you email it a patch and 
it will compile test it on a few different configs and run sparse, will 
send you back mail when it's done.
I don't want to boot it, as that gets into security nightmares, but I 
should be able to provide something that does static testing.

E_NEEDS_AUTOMATED_FILTER / lint of some form.
The others all look doable.
The intent would not be that you get burdened with this, but that 
developers send it there before sending it to you. It could even
hand out

tokens to people who use it ;-)
