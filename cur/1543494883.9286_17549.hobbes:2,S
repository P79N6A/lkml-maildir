Good!

Page cache: there's no question about it.

Anything left in the buffer cache will be a relic from previously
written data which hasn't yet been read: file writes are currently
handled with write-through to the buffer cache.

	unsigned long blocknr = bmap (dir, offset);
	struct buffer_head *bh = getblk (dir->i_dev, blocknr, size);
	if (!buffer_uptodate(bh))
		ll_rw_block(READ, 1, &bh);
or some variation thereon.
