Here's the weird shit.  If you can see how to break it, I'd like to
know.
Whenever the dm driver maps a buffer_head, I increment a 'pending'
counter for that device, and hook the bh->b_end_io, bh->b_private
function so that this counter is decremented when the io completes.
This doesn't work with ext3 on 2.4 kernels since ext3 believes the
b_private pointer is for general filesystem use rather than just
b_end_io, however Stephen Tweedie and I have been discussing ways to
get round this.  On 2.5 this works fine since the bio->bi_private
isn't abused in this way.

You are correct, this is the main flaw IMO with the LVM1 version of
pvmove (which was userland with locking on a per extent basis).
However for LVM2 the device will only be suspended while a table
is loaded, *not* while the move takes place.  I will however allocate
the struct deferred_io objects from a mempool in 2.5.
