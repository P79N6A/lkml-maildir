Good afternoon to everyone on the kernel list.  I hope that the
approaching mid-week finds things going well.

I would have to agree with the general course that this thread is
taking.
I am in the process of architecting a new service infrastructure for
our local university.  It is predicated on a Category of Service model
and as such defines different classes of service as well as QOS type
things for the services.
One of the big issues that I am dealing with right now is file and
print services.  We have a reasonably substantial Novell presence and
I am looking at providing file services through a Linux based Samba
solution.  I have already integrated our Kerberos/LDAP
authentication/authorization mechanisms into the Samba sources and I
am now looking at issues that will affect a more general roll-out.
One of the things that quickly becomes apparent is that the standard
UNIX permission model becomes a serious limitation when attempting to
replicate Novell file services with an SMB based solution.  At least
in a university setting there is a general tendency for groups of
users to want to share files and/or a common workplace.  We have
jumped through a number of hoops with groups and somewhat exotic
permission structures to implement desired accessibility models.
I am tracking ACL's under Linux right now to develop a more
generically useful file sharing model with SMB.  I think that LDAP
driven ACL support for Samba offers some promise for an intrigueing
set of solutions.
