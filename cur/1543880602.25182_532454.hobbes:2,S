From the debian etch 4.0 /etc/init.d/halt script:
        # Don't shut down drives if we're using RAID.
        hddown="-h"
        if grep -qs '^md.*active' /proc/mdstat
        then
                hddown=""
        fi
        # If INIT_HALT=HALT don't poweroff.
        poweroff="-p"
        if [ "$INIT_HALT" = "HALT" ]
        then
                poweroff=""
        fi
        # Make it possible to not shut down network interfaces,
        # needed to use wake-on-lan
        netdown="-i"
        if [ "$NETDOWN" = "no" ]; then
                netdown=""
        fi
        log_action_msg "Will now halt"
        halt -d -f $netdown $poweroff $hddown
So it will always call halt -d when doing shutdown. I've also noticed
that doing suspend to disk, the drive don't spins up two times. Next
shutdown I'll try to remove the -d option and I'll report what it
does....
