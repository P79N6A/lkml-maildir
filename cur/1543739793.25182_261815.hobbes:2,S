I'm experiencing terrible kernel panics at a very early bootstrap stage
while testing the U5 and U6 latest patch(es) on my laptop (P4/UP) --
(Ingo: this is about the very same trouble I've reported while pre-testing
U6).
Sorry that I can't show any trace dumps; only a hard-screenshot (with
digital camera?) would be possible but rather incomplete. The serial
console hack is not an option--these "modern" laptops doesn't come with
serial ports anymore, and netconsole is a no-op at a so early point of the
boot process. Or so I believe.
OK. After some incremental configurations, I've isolated that those
oops(es) only occurs if PREEMPT_TIMING and/or LATENCY_TRACE areset (Y). My
first suspect was that newest RWSEM_DEADLOCK_DETECT, but it wasn't the
case.
So something has broken on that non-preemptible critical section timing
stuff since U4.
Hasn't anybody else stumbled on this?
