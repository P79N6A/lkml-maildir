I know of a new high end machine, under gentleman's NDA, which might be
running Linux some day.  The compiler people for this machine want to
know if the Linux folks care which way the stack grows.  The exact question
is:
    "Does it matter to Linux whether the stacks in user codes run up
    (pointer starts at a low address and increments to get more memory)
    or down (pointer starts at a high address and decrements to get
    more memory)?  If it does matter, which is preferred?"
More details (some stuff removed to protect the guilty :-)

Thanks.
