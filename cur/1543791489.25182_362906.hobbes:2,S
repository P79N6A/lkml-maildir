+eCryptfs: A stacked cryptographic filesystem for Linux
+Maintainer: Phillip Hellewell
+Lead developer: Michael A. Halcrow <mhalcrow@us.ibm.com>
+Developers: Michael C. Thompson
+            Kent Yoder
+Current Release Version: 0.1
+
+This software is currently undergoing development. Make sure to
+maintain a backup copy of any data you write into eCryptfs.
+
+eCryptfs requires the userspace tools downloadable from the
+SourceForge site:
+
+
http://sourceforge.net/projects/ecryptfs/
+
+Run make and make install from the request-key/ directory.
+
+
+MOUNT-WIDE PASSPHRASE
+
+Create a new directory into which eCryptfs will write its encrypted
+files (i.e., /root/crypt).  Then, create the mount point directory
+(i.e., /mnt/crypt).  Now it's time to mount eCryptfs:
+
+mount -t ecryptfs /root/crypt /mnt/crypt
+
+You should be prompted for a passphrase and a salt (the salt may be
+blank).
+
+Try writing a new file:
+
+echo "Hello, World" > /mnt/crypt/hello.txt
+
+The operation will complete.  Notice that there is a new file in
+/root/crypt that is 3 pages (12288 bytes) in size.  This is the
+encrypted underlying file for what you just wrote.  To test reading,
+from start to finish, you need to clear the user session keyring:
+
+keyctl clear @u
+
+Then umount /mnt/crypt and mount again per the instructions given
+above.
+
+cat /mnt/crypt/hello.txt
+
+
+NOTES
+
+eCryptfs should only be mounted on (1) empty directories or (2)
+directories containing files only created by eCryptfs. If you mount a
+directory that has pre-existing files not created by eCryptfs, then
+behavior is undefined.
