Ah, interesting.
(Jarod, didn't you see OS X report the same size on that 3rd gen. iPod
as Linux without quirk flag, or did I dream this?  In any case this
could of course simply mean that OS X uses a wrongly reported size...)

Now that you mention it I do remember.  I would need to ask the reporter
of the Ubuntu bug who has a fully working 3rd gen iPod (unlike Jarod's
3rd gen iPod which doesn't work reliably anymore) to compile a kernel
from patched sources if I really wanted to investigate whether the
last_sector_bug flag fixes the issue too.  The fix_capacity flag can be
easily enabled for FireWire disks by users of binary kernel packages at
runtime, so that's what I had the reporter try.
Hmm, I'm beginning to suspect that I should duplicate usb-storage's
	if (sdev->type == TYPE_DISK)
		sdev->last_sector_bug = 1;
into the FireWire drivers.  There aren't any fundamental downsides to
this, are there?

Or they don't support these kinds of RAID over certain transports like
USB and FireWire...?
