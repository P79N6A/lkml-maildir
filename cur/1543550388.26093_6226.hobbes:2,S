When modprobing for this module, my machine gets stuck with no
messages whatsoever in the log. Only Alt-SysRq-R works (the other
combinations, while outputting something to the screen, do not
actually terminate the tasks or remount r/o the filesystem).
The last thing on the screen was the output of the probe of the scsi
chain on the aic adapter. It just had the time to print the name of
the scanner that it is connected to it and then nothing more.
I still can switch between the different vc, but no input is accepted.
Any hints?
