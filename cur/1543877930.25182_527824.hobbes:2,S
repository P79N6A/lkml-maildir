Ironically, your patch decreases throughput on my quad core
test system, with Jakub's test case.
MADV_DONTNEED, my patch, 10000 loops  (14k context switches/second)
real    0m34.890s
user    0m17.256s
sys     0m29.797s
MADV_DONTNEED, my patch & your patch, 10000 loops  (50 context 
switches/second)
real    1m8.321s
user    0m20.840s
sys     1m55.677s
I suspect it's moving the contention onto the page table lock,
in zap_pte_range().  I guess that the thread private memory
areas must be living right next to each other, in the same
page table lock regions :)
For more real world workloads, like the MySQL sysbench one,
I still suspect that your patch would improve things.
Time to move back to debugging other stuff, though.
Andrew, it would be nice if our patches could cook in -mm
for a while.  Want me to change anything before submitting?
