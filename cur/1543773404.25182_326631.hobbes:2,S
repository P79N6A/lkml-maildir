Then perhaps your page table is corrupt.  But my guess would be
that for some reason you're mapping it into userspace twice,
and the second attempt is BUGing.

Strange.  We don't know of any new artificial constraint there.
You'd better do some debugging e.g. print out what's in the pte
that isn't pte_none, and what is pte you want to replace it by.
