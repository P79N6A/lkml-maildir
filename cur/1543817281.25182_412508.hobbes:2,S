It's a great idea until you ask which init script will be used and 
forced on all the other vendors. Or all the vendors, let's standardize 
on my script, or your script, or Linus' script.
Better yet, let's leave it alone, because even if there were a script 
with the kernel, it would not be a standard ir would only be a default. 
All the vendors do their own thing because they feel it's best, and 
that's not going to change (not probably should it).
