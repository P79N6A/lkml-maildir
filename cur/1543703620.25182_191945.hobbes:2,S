I also have been getting apparently false MCEs since 2.5.xx 
I even had kernel panics in early 2.5 with MCE enabled. Now in 2.6.0-xx
and in 2.6.1 I just get them from time to time but none fatal.
most of the time in CPU 0
request_module: failed /sbin/modprobe -- char-major-6-0. error = 256
MCE: The hardware reports a non fatal, correctable incident occurred on CPU 0.
