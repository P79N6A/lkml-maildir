It is mostly due to ext2's directory block allocation policy.  Files are
allocated close together if they're in the same directory, but
directories are spread more or less randomly over the disk.  I have a
program called "treescan" which tries to read in a better order.  It's
faster but you still hear a lot of head activity.  It's not particularly
random -- it seems even small seeks are noisy.

The writes makes some difference: the inodes do seem to get written back
in a bad order.  You can see how much improvement is possible here by
mounting with `nodiratime'.
With 2.3.26 the inode write-backs don't seem so significant.  (That's
100% subjective and unscientific).
