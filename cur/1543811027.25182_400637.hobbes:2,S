OK.
[aside]
Actually I have a scalability improvement for rwsems, that moves the
actual task wakeups out from underneath the rwsem spinlock in the up()
paths. This was useful exactly on a mixed read+write workload on mmap_sem.
The difference was quite large for the "generic rwsem" algorithm because
it uses the spinlock in fastpaths a lot more than the xadd algorithm. I
think x86-64 uses the former, which is what I presume you're testing with?
Obviously this is a slightly different issue from the one you're trying to
address here, but I'll dig out patch when I get some time and you can see
if it helps.
