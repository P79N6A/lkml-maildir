Richard,
Can you admit the follow, that GPL has everything to control
redistribution, and has ZERO context for copyright.  The holders of the
copyright control the issues.
See your whole hook is "Derivative Works" well, I implimented a protocol.
It works regardless of platform or OS.  All it uses are simple and
standard kernel services.
Since I am willing to list every kernel function I call, and see who is
going to object to me doing what everyone else is doing and is clearly
positioned as accepted as of 1995.  If you were not aware of this
position, and I was not either, tough.  Linus sets the rules and he
controls the key interfaces.
Next you have NO ownership in the kernel, so unless you try to collect a
group of copyright holders and advocate on their behalf, I think you are
way out of bounds to even be here, period.  As you have stated already,
this is an issue exclusive to the copyright holders, and you are not one
of us.  So please live by your own words, or state you legal position to
be here in the affairs of the Copyright holders.

Andre Hedrick, CTO & Founder
