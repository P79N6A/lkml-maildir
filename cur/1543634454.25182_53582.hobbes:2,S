Not all at one time, but you can map/unmap shared memory segments to 
access more memory.

Hardware limitations imposed by the x86 architecture.  The x86 only has 
_one_ virtual address space, which has to be shared by user space and 
kernel space.  It is not possible to give user space more virtual 
address space without taking it away from the kernel.

Support for 64-bit processors like Intel Itanium and AMD Hammer 
processors which do not have such limitations.
