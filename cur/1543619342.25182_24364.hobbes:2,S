Um, I really have no time for this, I have no problem with sending
patches to whoever/whatever.
I'm not arguing for/against bk at all, if you can demonstrate how bk
solves all of our problems and people want to use it, I had absolutely
no problem with that.
But you are correct my experiences with bk are limited and not very
encouraging. Now I only use it to extract specific versions from the ppc
tree and to import that into the apus tree. Maybe a "bk howto for cvs
users" might help, which shows typical cvs use cases and how to do them
with bk, the documentation I found only stresses the bad sides of cvs.
bye, Roman
