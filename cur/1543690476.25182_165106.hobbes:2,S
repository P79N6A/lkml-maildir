Hello,
I just switched to a self compiled 2.6.0-test4 kernel with devfs support on 
my Debian unstable system. devfsd is running nicely without any complaints.
On my old 2.4.20 kernel I did not use devfs.
Now when I boot into the new 2.6 kernel it starts up but throws tons of 
messages like
...
FATAL: Module /dev/ttyx0
FATAL: Module /dev/ttyx1
FATAL: Module /dev/ttyx2
FATAL: Module /dev/ttyx3
FATAL: Module /dev/ttyx4
FATAL: Module /dev/ttyx5
...
and it seems not to find alot of other /dev entries as well.
Googling around I did not find any hints about where this problem might 
come from.
Any ideas what might be wrong?
TIA, Harry
