It is actually very easy. Just one keyboard, and just one monitor is
"system console". All others are just normal terminals. 
There's already same problem with serial console / vt problem. There's
solution saying "user selects using command line what _real_ console
is". No new problem here.
[And yes, serial console can do both sysrq and printing kernel
messages. No new problems here.]
