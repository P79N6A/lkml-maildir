Enabling FastWrites with the nvidia-module kills X and the box instantly at 
boot, but is ok when X was running without FastWirties, is shut down, 
reloading the modules with FastWrites and starting X. So there are even some 
odd things with APG2
I am sorry that I can't help very much, despite of testing,  I am not afraid 
of building a lot of kernels, because my knowledge of C tends to zero. I came 
to the first mentioned changes by grepping for SiS stuff in the kernel 
sources, meditating about the stuff, and than simple copied what seems to be 
ok for me.
If you or somebody else wants me to test SiS related stuff, I am quite happy 
to help, except of that I am just an user with too little knowledge about C 
or kernel stuff. 
Glück Auf,
Volker
