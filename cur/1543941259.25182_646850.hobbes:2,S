i've added it to the queue. If you dont hear more from me today it means 
the fix works fine :)
Thanks for the quick fix - i had to temporarily turn off all of ALSA 
from the automated tester because sound/drivers/opl3/opl3_synth.c was 
unconditionally built in when ALSA was enabled. (which blew half a 
million lines of Linux sound code out from the scope of my testing - not 
good for test coverage)
