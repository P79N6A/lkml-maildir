wake-one alone solves the problem, doesnt it? And we have wake-one in
2.3.3. I'm curious how that patch looks like nevertheless. (i'm just
rather convinced that it cannot be done constant-time without giving up
crucial scheduling features, but i'd be happy to be proved otherwise. 
There _are_ ways to make it constant, it just sacrifices things like
proper SMP scheduling.)
