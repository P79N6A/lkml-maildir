Any machine today that has 129 processors had better be a 64 bit
machine. And this is not an issue on x86_64.  If you do have a 128+ CPU
i386 machine, then modify the kernel yourself :)

userspace spinlocks are really bad.  Unless you pin all the threads that
share that lock to their own CPU, you can have one thread preempting
another that owns the lock, and then spin waiting for the owner to
release the lock, while the owner is waiting to run on the processor
that has the spinning thread.  In the RT world, this can spell death.
Look into using futexes.  They are fast userspace mutexes.  I believe
the pthread mutex code uses these.  They are also robust and can also
include priority inheritance.  They run in userspace unless there is
contention, which they then go into the kernel.
