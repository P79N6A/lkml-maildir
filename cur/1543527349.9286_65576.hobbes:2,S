I just gave up on that same thing... I'm fed up with tulips and I didn't
get a good feeling for the Adaptec starfire driver.  I ordered 2-port
Intel EtherExpress Pro/100 lan adapters yesterday, and we plan to put
two per machine.  If you want to know how they work out, e-mail me back.
I'm not doing any channel bonding with them though.
Good luck
Jeff
