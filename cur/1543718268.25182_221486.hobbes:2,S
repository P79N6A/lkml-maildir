No, this list gets monthly (if not more often) announcements of new 
versions of the "shortlog" tool and the other related tool, both of 
which are used pretty much exclusively by Linus and Marcelo. I haven't 
seen anyone complain about those, and their frequency is 10 times that 
of the BK update announcements.
