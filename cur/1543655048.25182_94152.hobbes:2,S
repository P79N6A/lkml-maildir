OK, consider the phrase for architectures with subordinate PCI busses added.

Well, we are moving in this direction.  I've already done the conversion for 
MCA.  Marc Zyngier has done it for EISA.  I believe someone is looking at PnP 
ISA.  ISA, as a non-probe'able bus fits into the legacy bus scheme anyway.

That's PCI specific.  We need a coherent tree in the generic model.  To do 
this, the PCI parent information has to be available just using the struct 
device, without having to cast it to pci_dev and look at pci specific fields.
This is a simplification requirement for machines whose IOMMUs lie on other 
bus types above the PCI busses.  You have to be able to walk up the device 
tree until you find the IOMMU.  Since you're sharing the implementation with 
the non-PCI busses, you need to be able to do this in a generic manner.
