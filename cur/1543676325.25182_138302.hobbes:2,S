Please help.  I have a redhat 7.3 computer accross the country that was 
installed using the WORKSTATION option.  I desperately need to telnet into 
it, but with the new xinetd.d stuff, don't know how.  Can ANYBODY tell me how 
to get the telnet deamon running on this box so that I can remotely log in?
