If your blocks are so big that you lose track of variables like
this... then it is too big and/or complex.
And the argument about having it simply _not exist_ before the
first assignment isn't convincing to me, because you cannot
undeclare variables after you finish with them (do you also see
code where people cause bugs by forgetting about the variable after
its last use?).
IMO, the system of declaring all variables at the top of the block
and they all disappear at the end is nice and symmetric... although
I probably agree with Linus on the 'for (int i = 0;' feature.
