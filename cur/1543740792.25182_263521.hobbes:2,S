Not always - sometimes you win (Soundblaster, IBM PC) and sometimes you
lose. Often you only win if you have a quality differentiator so you can
sneer at the opposition and use words like "PC clone" and
"Soundblaster compatible"

Not really, we are heading towards real time raytrace and the hardware
and low level changes dramatically for that (including wanting to do non
light traces for audio mixing, explosion models etc)
