How do you differentiate between whether a core is resumable or not.
IOW, how do you know the generated /proc/vmcore has been generated after
a real crash hence can't be resumed (using krestore) or it has been 
generated because of hibernation/debug purposes and can be resumed?
I think you might have to add an extra ELF NOTE to vmcore which can help
decide whether kernel memory snapshot is resumable or not.

How about a different name like "--load-preserve-context". This will
just mean that kexec need to preserve the context while kexeing to 
image being loaded. Combination of --load-jump-back and
--load-jump-back-helper is becoming little confusing.

Restoring a hibernated image using /dev/oldmem should be easy and I 
think one should be able to launch it back using --load-jump-back-helper.
How do you restore already kexeced kernel? For example if I got two
kernels A and B. A is the one which will hibernate and B will be used
to store the hibernated kernel. I think as per the procedure one needs
to first boot into kernel B and then jump back to kernel A. This will
make image of B available in /proc/kimgcore. If I save /proc/kimgcore
to disk and want to jump back to it, how do I do it? I guess I need
to kexec again using --load-jump-back and not restore using krestore?

How about decoupling entry point from --load-jump-back-helper. We can
introduce a separate option for entry point. Something like.
kexec --load-jump-back-helper --entry=$jump_back_entry
May be we can generalize the --entry so that a user can override the 
entry point of the normal kexec image using above.

What are we communicating between two kernels using kimgcore?
I am setting up a system to test out the patches. More later...
