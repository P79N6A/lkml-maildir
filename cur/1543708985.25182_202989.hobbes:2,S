Thanks for the confidence, bur I really don't know, it's much easier
to criticize someone elses design than to come up with a good one
myself. :-)
With that said, I think that they way the Linux kernel is moving
regarding to IDE/SCSI devices is a good idea.  Linux has been around
for a while now and the Linux people have tried lots of things that
turned out not to be such a good idea after all.  Many things are
still there in the kernel, but if it's important enough, it gets
cleaned up after a while.
