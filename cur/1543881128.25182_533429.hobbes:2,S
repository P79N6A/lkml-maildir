No need to worry about it. If we ignored the ->free_clusters in
FSINFO, the fat drivers counts the current free clusters by scaning
FAT entries if needed.

It would add the limitation to following simple usage,
	# mount -t vfat /dev/sda1 /mnt
        # cp -a * /mnt
        # umount
if /dev/sda1 was the large and slow device, "mount" will need several
minutes to counts free clusters. I think the user will be hard to
accept the several minutes at "mount".
Thanks.
