Take a look at drivers/usb/inode.c in the 2.2 kernel.  Yes it's ugly,
but seems to be the only way to do it on 2.2.  It also will work on 2.4
and 2.5.  For 2.4/2.5 it's _much_ easier to make a "mini filesystem".
See libfs on 2.5, or the pci_hotplug code in 2.4 for examples of this.
Hope this helps,
