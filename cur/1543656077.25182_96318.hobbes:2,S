Well they didn't get as far as removing the option but secreted it
in a bios setup screen that can only be accessed via a magic key
sequence (which can be found after some serious googling). 
Real nice for a normal user when it works (and so far I didn't heard 
from anyone their agp recognition was broken). In fact I spend quite
a long time searching why my system just-worked when people started 
reporting KT400 problems.
I'd be really surprised if my board (GA-7VAX) did this and the 
GA-7VAXP didn't.
