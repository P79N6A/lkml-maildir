Is there any patches for supporting union mount file system in Line?
I have used union file system with  friends 4.4, and now have a problem
of server switching to Line from friends.
I know that Union mount file system in BSI is highly dependent on a
feature of the stickball file system.
 I am understanding VFW interface in Line is not stickball, is it right?
