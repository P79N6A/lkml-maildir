Parisc looks like it's doing the extra memory barrier to "be safe" :P
Re the ppc64 chageset: It looks to me like lwsync is the lightweight
sync, and eieio is just referred to as the lightER (than sync) weight
sync. What's more, it looks like eieio does order stores to system
memory and is not just an MMIO barrier.
But nit picking aside, is it true that we need a load barrier before
unlock? (store barrier I agree with) The ppc64 changeset in question
indicates yes, but I can't quite work out why. There are noises in the
archives about this, but I didn't pinpoint a conclusion...
