Exactly the same is true of my EBSA285 BIOS.  The "fix" for the situation
that the infringers came up with was to take down the binary download from
their website which allowed me to obtain a binary copy of my code.  They
refused to supply source, and to date, I haven't heard anything from the
company concerned.
