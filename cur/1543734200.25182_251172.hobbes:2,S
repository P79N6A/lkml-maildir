I mean that a process would have be permitted to "use" a key (whatever 
that means) but have no right to read the contents, delegating the 
reading to a second process.  This way a process could delegate the act 
of seeing the key contents (computing a signature, for example) to a 
trusted process, limiting the damage if the key-holding program is 
compromised.  This also might allow smart-cards to fit into the model 
(where "use" makes sense but "read" is meant to be physically impossible).
Maybe one way to do this is to have a second UID attached to the key 
(with its corresponding permission mask), the restriction that Read 
without Search is forbidden and the exception that Search is implied by 
a key's presence in a keyring.  You'd also need to prevent the key owner 
from changing the key's permissions if the owner doesn't have Read.
So my hypothetical ssh agent-like program has a key with UID 500: VLS / 
GID whatever: - / 2nd UID 100: R and a setuid-100 program that does 
public-key ops on it.  Then if the user's account is compromised, no one 
gets the private key.
I'm out of town now, so I haven't actually tried any of this.  I'll take 
a look at the code next week.
