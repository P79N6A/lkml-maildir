Yes, you could use process groups to emulate POSIX thread killing
semantics, but that requires your "heavyweight process" to switch to a
new process group. That might not always be what you want (and may
possibly violate POSIX). So I'd be happier if we could find some clean
and lightweight way of adding a new grouping mechanism so we can
properly support POSIX thread killing semantics *and* not interfere
with process groups.
Still, if we can't find a way of doing that cleanly, I'd rather we try
and get POSIX changed so that we can meet the spec. I hear there is a
final cleanup session starting soon. Worth a try, even if they say no.
As a minimal change, perhaps POSIX could say that the behaviour of
process groups is implementation-defined for threaded processes.
But let's first see what Chris Smith comes up with with in his process
grouping patch.
