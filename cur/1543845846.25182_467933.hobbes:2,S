I think you can push that angle, and a lot of the time it will work in 
practice - because the companies involved are really not "evil", and most 
often they simply want to avoid any trouble. 
At the same time, in many cases the settlements seem to be very much about 
real issues, like not actually following the GPLv2 (giving no credit, not 
mentioning the license, not making sources available). Rather than about 
any imagined or real lock-down issues.
There's certainly a _correlation_ between "locking down" and "being sleazy 
in general", but I don't think it's necessarily a causal relationship.
