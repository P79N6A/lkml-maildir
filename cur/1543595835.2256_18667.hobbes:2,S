Yep - a driver should print out that it loaded and what hardware it
found. Nothing else.
You know what I hate? Debugging stuff like BIOS-e820, zone messages,
dentry|buffer|page-cache hash table entries, CPU: Before vendor init,
CPU: After vendor init, etc etc, PCI: Probing PCI hardware, 
ip_conntrack (256 buckets, 2048 max), the complete APIC tables, etc
That's stuff that noone cares about. If the system fails to boot
boot it with a debug flag. If it does boot, _fine_.
Mike.
