Hi.  I occasionally had problems like you describe 'sbp2 aborting
request', but on my system sbp2 would always recover.  All I would see
were a delay in data access, and an entry in /var/log/messages.  There
were a lot of changes to ieee1394 between 2.6.3 and 2.6.4, and haven't
seen sbp2 fail since (two or three patches) before 2.6.4.  Try the 2.6.4
kernel (or newer) and see if that helps.
Bob
