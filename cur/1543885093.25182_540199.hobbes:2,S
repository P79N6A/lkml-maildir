Philip:
the best response I can offer is that we have traced the application's
file system accesses and seen no such one-byte writes occuring at that
level. They are generated somewhere below the application. Additionally,
while we have observed iTunes on Windows issuing these one-byte writes,
ethereal traces for iTunes on Mac OSX show no such behavior. Because of
these observations I think it is reasonable to conclude that the Windows
CIFS client is generating the one-byte writes.
thanks,
Mason
