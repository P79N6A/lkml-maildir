Hi!
What happened to SUSPEND_SAVE_STATE?
pcmcia_socket_dev_suspend() still expects to receive it, but I do not
see any place where it is generated. Should it be killed from
device.h? And these 6 places fixed?
pavel@amd:/usr/src/linux$ grep SUSPEND_SAVE_STATE `find . -name "*.c"`
./arch/ppc/ocp/ocp-driver.c:            if (level == SUSPEND_SAVE_STATE && ocp_dev->driver->save_state)
./arch/arm/mach-sa1100/neponset.c:      if (level == SUSPEND_SAVE_STATE ||
./drivers/pcmcia/i82092.c:      return pcmcia_socket_dev_suspend(&dev->dev, state, SUSPEND_SAVE_STATE);
./drivers/pcmcia/sa1111_generic.c:      return pcmcia_socket_dev_suspend(&dev->dev, state, SUSPEND_SAVE_STATE);
./drivers/serial/8250_pci.c:                    serial8250_suspend_port(priv->line[i], SUSPEND_SAVE_STATE);
./drivers/serial/core.c:        case SUSPEND_SAVE_STATE:
pavel@amd:/usr/src/linux$
