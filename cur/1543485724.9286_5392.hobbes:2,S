Hi.
I recently upgraded one of our unimportant network machines to 2.2.1.
2.2 is surely faster than 2.0 and has lots of interesting features. But
I found a couple of problems:
1) Aliased interfaces disappeared from /proc/net. "route" doesn't show
aliased interfaces, instead it shows a parent one. At least one
automatic firewalling script broke because of this - it got the IP
addresses to pass through firewall basing on interface names from
/proc/net/dev. Also this is not very convinient during debugging of
network problems on multihomed servers, but I can live with it. Any way
to
get it to work the old way (an unofficial patch which will never get
into the tree etc)?
2) "ifconfig down" (net-tools 1.50) on an aliased interface also brings
the parent interface down. Ouch. That means if I alias interface for
testing on some machine I will have either to give it a bogus IP address
or reboot. Maybe there is some special method of bringing the aliases
down I don't know about?
3) ipchains doesn't let me to set up a rule for interface IP address (as
was with ipfwadm). That promises problems on machines with changing PPP
interfaces - I have accounting rules to calculate our clients' traffic.
Now I would have to rehack one nice firewall script into /etc/ppp/ip-up
to set up the rules and /etc/ppp/ip-down to delete them. Also the
counters will be reset whenever the client disconnects for some reason.
Is there a better workaround?
4) diald refuses to work on 2.2. Maybe there is a patch to fix this? I
know pppd-2.3.5 supports demand dialing, but diald has been working fine
for over a year now, changing it to something new would take time..
5) Any known problems with gated due to changed aliased interface
policy?
Anyway, even if there are no positive answers to my questions, I can
live with 2.0.3x - I hope these changes won't be backported to 2.0.37.
;)
Aah, one of my 2.0.36 keeps crashing. I guess I have to get used to a
reboot every week :(
