The code was completely redone. It was not done in sections. Breaking them into
pieces is nothing more than an academic exercise. It is not useable until all
the code changes have been made because it would require a prom that followed these
changes.  The point of a review was to get comments on the CONTENT of the code not
the format of the patches.

The easiest way to review is to delete the old directorory and apply the new ioif
files. Reviewing it as patches doesn't make any sense. The new code is very small and
it should be possible to look at it intact.
