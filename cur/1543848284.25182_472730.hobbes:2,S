Ah, OK.  I misunderstood what thermal zones are.

Right, bad assumption on my part.  Is there any way to find out what 
they might correspond to?  /proc/acpi/ibm/thermal has a bunch of 
temperature-like numbers in them; I guess there should be some 
correlation between those and the thermal zones.

I'll gather a bit more info.
