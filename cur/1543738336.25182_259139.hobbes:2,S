You wouldn't be able to do this just with sched domains, because
it doesn't know anything about individual tasks. As soon as you
have some overlap, all your tasks can escape out of your domain.
I don't think there is a really nice way to do overlapping sets.
Those that want them need to just use cpu affinity for now.
