Whoops, I spoke too soon.  It does get rid of SOME of the AE_TIME errors.  But
the system is still confused about whether or not the AC is connected, and
whether the battery is charging or not; and the CPU is still relatively hot.
Even with this patch I later got:
ACPI Exception (evregion-0424): AE_TIME, Returned by Handler for [EmbeddedControl] [20060707]
ACPI Exception (dswexec-0458): AE_TIME, While resolving operands for [OpcodeName unavailable] [2006070
7]
ACPI Error (psparse-0537): Method parse/execution failed [\_TZ_.THRM._TMP] (Node ffff810002032d10), AE
_TIME
In short, better but evidently not yet good enough...
