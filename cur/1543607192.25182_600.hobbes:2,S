Well this has certainly be an interesting discussion and it is nice to see that
for the most part it was kept quite reasonable. People's viewpoints on this
particular issue I think are going to come to the forefront as Linux slowly
gains ground in the desktop market. These are obviously, as I stated before,
opinions of a somewhat limited software development view. Thanks to all for your
responses...
