Are you using the usb-uhci host driver?
If so, the following fix from Georg Acher should do the trick:
-----
Replace line 275 (insert_td())
qh->hw.qh.element = virt_to_bus (new) | UHCI_PTR_TERM;
by
qh->hw.qh.element = virt_to_bus (new) ;

Let me (and the list) know if this doesn't fix your problem.
