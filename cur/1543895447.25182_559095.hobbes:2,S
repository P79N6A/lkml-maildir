If we expect userspace apps to include them, then I would vote for no, 
not for anything outside of #ifdef __KERNEL__ in exported headers. Keep 
in mind also that C++ apps may need to include these as well and those 
extensions don't always play well in C++ mode. (Last instance I ran into 
was the ioctl argument checking macros _IOR, _IOW, etc. that create 
non-compiling code if you use them in a C++ program.)
