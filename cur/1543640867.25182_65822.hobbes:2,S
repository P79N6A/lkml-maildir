Because he would like to write a code that can be run on a computer
with more than one CPU. 
Anyway, do anybody know what kind of advantages/disadvantages I can get
if I don't disable interrupts at all in my driver? Even if I have to use a circular
buffer or anything else? Is it worth trying to find such a solution or is it
a wasted time?
