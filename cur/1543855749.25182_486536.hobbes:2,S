Correct. Even though I know Linus disagrees here, I'm not sure
I want to do this, as my ultimate goal would be to eliminate the
hand-crafted linking (which we know got broken a few times on
x86-64, because it's so easy to forget about).
Not the least of the reasons for this is that this increases the
chances of stucks.

Certainly, will be a follow-up patch.
