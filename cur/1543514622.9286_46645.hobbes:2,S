Subject: simple promise66 hack for 2.2.13/14

hacking promise66 "support" into standard kernels is easy:
include/linux/pci.h:
- #define PCI_DEVICE_ID_PROMISE_20246	0x4d33
+ #define PCI_DEVICE_ID_PROMISE_20246	0x4d38 /* fake promise66 as promise33  */
This kills promise33 support.
A machine with 2 controllers, 5 drives, raid5 was stresstested with this: works flawlessly. No SMP used however.
2.2.14pre2 contains additional IDE/SMP fixes, compared to 2.2.13 (don´t know if someone already stresstested pre2).
Unified IDE of course has promise66 support (but probably doesn´t contain the newest SMP fixes yet). It also has large disk support (if I remember right).
======
Machine is running ok with 1 cpu, but i like to use the second one.
I read that 2.2.13 has some bugfixes for ide +raid
Is the bug fixed ?
And :
raid 0.9 is in Ac1 and Ac2 patch , so i should patch it with this one, but
what about ide (promise udma66) support ? 
i only see a 2.2.12 and 2.2.13pe17 kernel patch, so which one should i use
?
(or is there a 2.2.13final patch?)
