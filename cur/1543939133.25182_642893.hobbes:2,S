Right.
Xen provides a initial set of pagetables in the appropriate format, so 
what head.S generates is moot.  For simplicity I graft the Xen-provided 
pagetables into swapper_pg_dir in xen_start_kernel, so it is the 
functional equivalent to the head.S pagetable construction.
We also don't (yet) support PSE, so that's a non-issue for us too.
