Once per page, it's basically exercising the generic_file_splice_read()
path. Basically X number of "clients" open the same file, and fill those
pages into a pipe using splice. The output end of the pipe is then
spliced to /dev/null to toss it away again. The top of the 4-client
vanilla run profile looks like this:
samples  %        symbol name
65328    47.8972  find_get_page
Basically the machine is fully pegged, about 7% idle time.
We can speedup the lookups with find_get_pages(). The test does 64k max,
so with luck we should be able to pull 16 pages in at the time. I'll try
and run such a test. But boy I wish find_get_pages_contig() was there
for that. I think I'd prefer adding that instead of coding that logic in
splice, it can get a little tricky.
