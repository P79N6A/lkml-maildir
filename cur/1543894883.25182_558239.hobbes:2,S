That's not gonna work, it's a totally different model.
I have a predefined protocol over hypervisor provided "channels" and
page flipping also done by the hypervisor for the bulk data transfer.
For the client side I cannot change the hypervisor nor the server
speaking on the other end.  And when I do write a server I do want
it to be able to speak to all of the existing clients.
There's SCSI command pass through as well, as I keep mentioning as
it's an important reason I don't want to go with any of the non-SCSI
solutions (other than perhaps ATA) being suggested.
