We broke back-compatibility.  The changelog _failed to tell us_ that we
were breaking back-compatibility.  The patch wouldn't have been applied if
we'd been told that.  At least, not without a lot of careful thought.
The fact that the changelog failed to tell us this makes one suspect that
the breakage was inadvertent.
So no, upgrading HAL is not a good answer.  Please fix the kernel.
