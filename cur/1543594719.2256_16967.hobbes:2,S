Well, I didn't write the driver that I'm trying to port, so it's a little
difficult.  The code in question is:
struct dentry *	de = lookup_dentry(zfcdb[i].fullname, NULL, LOOKUP_FOLLOW);
if (IS_ERR(de))
	continue;
if (de != zfcdb[i].dentry) 
{
	print("zfc: dentry changed for %s\n", zfcdb[i].fullname);
	zfc_file_init(&zfcdb[i], de);
}
So it appears it's just checking to see if the dentry for a particular file has
changed.
