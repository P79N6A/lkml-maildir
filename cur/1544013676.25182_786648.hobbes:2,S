Agreed... So what about this one?

Document linux filesystem expectations. Ext3 can't handle write errors
of any kind, and can't handle non-atomic sector writes. Other
filesystems are probably even worse...

+Linux filesystems can only work correctly when several conditions are
+met in the block layer and below (disks, flash cards). Some of them
+are obvious ("data on media should not change randomly"), some are
+less so.
+
+Write errors not allowed (NO-WRITE-ERRORS)
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Writes to media never fail. Even if disk returns error condition
+during write, filesystems can't handle that correctly, because success
+on fsync was already returned when data hit the journal.
+
+	Fortunately writes failing are very uncommon on traditional 
+	spinning disks, as they have spare sectors they use when write
+	fails.
+
+Sector writes are atomic (ATOMIC-SECTORS)
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Either whole sector is correctly written or nothing is written during
+powerfail.
+
+	Unfortuantely, none of the cheap USB/SD flash cards I seen do 
+	behave like this, and are unsuitable for all linux filesystems 
+	I know. 
+
+		An inherent problem with using flash as a normal block
+		device is that the flash erase size is bigger than
+		most filesystem sector sizes.  So when you request a
+		write, it may erase and rewrite the next 64k, 128k, or
+		even a couple megabytes on the really _big_ ones.
+
+		If you lose power in the middle of that, filesystem
+		won't notice that data in the "sectors" _after_ the
+		one your were trying to write to got trashed.
+
+	Because RAM tends to fail faster than rest of system during 
+	powerfail, special hw killing DMA transfers may be neccessary;
+	otherwise, disks may write garbage during powerfail.
+	Not sure how common that problem is on generic PC machines.

+Requirements
+============
+
+Ext3 expects disk/storage subsystem to behave sanely. On sanely
+behaving disk subsystem, data that have been successfully synced will
+stay on the disk. Sane means:
+
+* write errors not allowed
+
+* sector writes are atomic
+
+(see expectations.txt; note that most/all linux filesystems have similar
+expectations)
+
+* either write caching is disabled, or hw can do barriers and they are enabled.
+
+	   (Note that barriers are disabled by default, use "barrier=1"
+	   mount option after making sure hw can support them). 
+
