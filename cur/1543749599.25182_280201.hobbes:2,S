I admit to generally being in the same boat as you with respect to
running complex userspace apps.
However, based on this and other scattered reports, I'd say it seems
quite likely that token based thrashing control is the culprit. Based
on the cost/benefit, I wonder if we should disable TBTC by default for
2.6.10, rather than trying to fix it, and try again for 2.6.11?
Rik? Andrew?
Also, it would be nice to have a sysctl to *completely* disable TBTC,
that would make testing easier.
