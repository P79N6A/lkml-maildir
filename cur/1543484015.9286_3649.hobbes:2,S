Nope.  66 and 100.  I've got a 300 and a 350 here right now.
Both use 100, but will also work at 66 no prob.  The 350 won't
work in Windows 98 though.
Someone said that Windows had a bug with AMD chips.  Anyone know
where I can find out more on this?  I'd prefer to stay away from
Microsofts rediculous website if possible.
