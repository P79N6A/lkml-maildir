Hi,
this patch adds __devexit_p where necessary and change some stupid (?) and confusing __devinit to __devexit in the remove functions
with this and the previous patch for the cs4281 all OSS drivers compile and link fine for me
I have had some compile errors if gameport/joystick support is disabled and I'll look at the code again later the day
Patch against 2.5.5-dj3 attached
