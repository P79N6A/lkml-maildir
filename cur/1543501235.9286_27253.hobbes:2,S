I once had an associate explain to me that everything in literature has
already been done.  The implication was that originality was not
feasible.  He found this comforting.  You see, it was sad, he wanted so
much to be a gifted intellectual, and he was indeed quite smart, with an
ability to precisely specify mathematical formalities that was really
quite impressive, yet he had absolutely no spark of originality.  He was
the brightest unoriginal person I had ever known, and sadly, being an
academic was actually the worst possible career choice for him.  He now
works for a supplier to Microsoft.
I regret to say that the truth was merely that not everyone has
originality as their gift, not that it had all been done before.  New
and original literature occurs frequently.  The same in OS design.
Universities come out with new and creative innovations all the time.
This is the advantage that open source has, that it can tap into this in
a way that is difficult for large corporations that are run by decent
people with stable personalities that do not produce brilliant
innovations.
