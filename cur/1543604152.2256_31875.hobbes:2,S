Subject: [BUG] [2.4.10] echo "scsi add-single-device ..." corrupts /proc/partitions

Hi!
After booting my system with 3 internal SCSI disks /proc/partitions shows the 
right partition information. When I later turn on an external disk, and do an 
"echo add-single-device .." /proc/partitions seems to be ... bad. It shows 
the right SCSI partitions, including the ones on the external disk, but it 
repeats this information indefinitely.
The get_partition_list () seems to doesn't seem to return EOF or so, or the 
gendisk_head list may have become cyclic. I'm not sure.
