You can't, internally splice is using a pipe which is currently confined
to 16 pages. The SPLICE_SIZE define isn't a suggestion in the code, it
reflects that. You could fix splice-cp to not stall on changing that,
however that still doesn't change the fact that you can only move chunks
of 64kb (on your arch) right now.
