 Hi,
  I was trying to configure IPsec in my Desktop,I
changed some of the configuration files and I need to
change in the /etc/grub.conf file.So after changing
it,I rebooted the system but I was not able to boot
inside. Iam getting the error as
 ds: no socket drivers loaded!
 VFS: Cannot open root device "LABEL=/" or 00:00
 Please append a correct "root=" boot option
 Kernel panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on 00:00
 Tried to login as single user mode, even that was not
booting giving the same error. please need a solution
as soon as possible.
regards,
kavitha.
