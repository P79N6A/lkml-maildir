The following script will generate cap_entries[] array.
cat include/linux/capability.h				\
  | egrep '^#define[ \t]+CAP_[A-Z_]+[ \t]+[0-9]+$'	\
  | awk '{ printf("\t{ %s, \"\" },\n", $2, tolower($2)); }'
It is nice to include the result of this script, like as:
static struct cap_entry_data cap_entries[] = {
	/* max number of supported format */
	{ _LINUX_CAPABILITY_VERSION,	"version" },
	/* max number of capability */
	{ CAP_LAST_CAP,			"index" },
#include "capability_names.h"
	{ -1,				NULL },
};
I guess we can put this script on Makefile like as kernel/timeconst.pl doing.
