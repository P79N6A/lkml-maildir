	Assuming that every L2 is Ethernet and every L3 is IP ?
	Well, I've got news for you : IrDA drivers are using
netif_rx() to pass IrLAP frames to the IrDA stack, and 802.11 driver
in the future will pass 802.11 frames to the 802.2 LLC layer via
netif_rx().
	Please don't do that, I don't want people breaking the IrDA
stack in weird ways just because some random clueless code hijacked
netif_rx(). Use netfilters, or define your own private protocol/packet
type to do what you want.
	Regards,
	Jean
