Hey, you're talking to pure user land here (but I guess it's meant for the other kernel hackers :-)

No options at all, except what lilo provides:
loke:loke:/proc$ cat cmdline
BOOT_IMAGE=2.4-Linux-test ro root=302 ramdisk=0
(Exchange 2.4-Linux-test with 2.5-Linux-test)
File systems compiled in:
loke:loke:/proc$ cat filesystems 
nodev   rootfs
nodev   bdev
nodev   proc
nodev   sockfs
nodev   tmpfs
nodev   pipefs
nodev   binfmt_misc
        ext2
        minix
        msdos
        vfat
        iso9660
nodev   nfs
Not changed in 2.5 (preempt enabled there shouldn't make a difference)

I interpret that as printk("mount() -> %d\n", err); can be swapped with printk("%s\n", p); and I'll do that right away. Last compile, then I must rush to work.
