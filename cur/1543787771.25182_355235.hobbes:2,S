I'd like it to work as well as it does for PPC :-).

I found that patch with a little help from the list. Unfortunately, it
makes things worse (not better) on my X32. [There was another
regression here. With 2.6.8 or so, backlight was off during S3 sleep
(but chip still running and eating power). With 2.6.14-rc3, not only
chip is running, but backlight is forced to max to add an insult to
the injury].
