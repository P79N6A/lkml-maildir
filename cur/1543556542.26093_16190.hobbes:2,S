I have the manual in the office, so I can look at it again in a couple of
days. I've used it to hack on the BSDI driver...

Cool, I'll try to go over the driver init sequence by the end of the
weekend and let you know if I see anything wrong.

Do you know if only one specific chip revision exhibits this problem? It
would really help track down the problem. If I remember correctly, 82557
doesn't have flow control at all, and 82558/9 have different 
implementations -- one is proprietary (82558) and one is standard (82559).
Thanks,
Ion
