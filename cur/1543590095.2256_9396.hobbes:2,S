    Wouldn't that be lot of the same issues as a "swapoff" with some

    course...)
No. Swapoff makes pages allocated to userland applications in swap
move back into main memory -- this is much easier because:
   - the pages are on disk, we _know_ the aren't locked my mlock or
     pinned for IO (kiobufs, whatever)
   - there are no kernel pages/buffers in this area, even harder than
     the above to deal with
