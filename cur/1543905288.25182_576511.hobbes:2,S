Ok I copied it into the tool, it gives me:
CPU 0 4 northbridge TSC b7d4a144d0 
  Northbridge ECC error
  ECC syndrome = 0
STATUS 0 MCGSTATUS 4
This is a bit strange because I repeatedly tested the
RAM yesterday and it gives no problems. And even more
interesting: the error occurs at a reproducible
moment: when reading the bad sector from the Seagate
harddisk. And with an older kernel I was able to just
copy all stuff from the drive using dd_rescue... I do
not have ECC RAM in my PC by the way.

So how to proceed in tackling this problem now? Is
there anything I can do to (help you guys ;)) fix it?
At this moment it unfortunately does not look to me as
a fixed failure path...
