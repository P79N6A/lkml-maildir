CONFIG_DEBUG_KERNEL is not really the appropriate thing to use here - it's
more a user-interface/Kconfig level thing.
Can you please describe the problems which suspend_console() are causing?
Some runtime knob might be more appropriate.  Perhaps /sys/power/debug?
If the suspend_console() call is to be disabled then you'll want to disable
the matching resume_console() call too.
printk.c needs sem2mutex conversion.
The console_suspended/secondary_console_sem handling is racy.  Bad Linus. 
But as we're running on a single CPU and all other tasks are frozen it
doesn't matter.
