Don't worry. The "\?" pattern is for temporary files with /tmp/prefixXXXXXX pattern.
/tmp/prefixXXXXXX is represented as /tmp/prefix\?\?\?\?\?\? in TOMOYO Linux's syntax.

The "\*" pattern is for this purpose which means more than 0 byte characters other than '/'.
TOMOYO supports various patterns
http://tomoyo.sourceforge.jp/en/1.5.x/policy-reference.html#exception_policy.conf
TOMOYO Linux handles string using 7bit ASCII. In TOMOYO Linux,
a byte 0x21 <= c <= 0x7E && c != 0x5C is represented as is,
c == 0x5C is represented as \\,
0x01 <= c <= 0x20 || 0x7F <= c <= 0xFF is represented as \ooo style.
c == 0x00 is not needed since it is used as end-of-string marker.
This rule makes any string passed from/to kernel safely.
Thanks.
