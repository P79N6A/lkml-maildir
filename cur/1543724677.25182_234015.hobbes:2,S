Yes, sorry for confusing, copy & paste from a wrong place.
I'm just wondering whether '!=0' is needed inside unlikely() as
defined in asm-i386/bug.h:
#define BUG_ON(condition) do { if (unlikely((condition)!=0)) BUG(); } while(0)
Without '!= 0', it's expanded identically as you wrote.
Well, the compiler may get rid of it after optimization...
BTW, BUG_ON(a||b) is a different story, of course :)
