Unfortunately, memory and power supply vendors have not kept as close to the
specs as we need.  The latest generation of cpus puts some serious demands
on these subsystems.  You might recall another cpu manufacturer bashing the
memory makers last fall.  Please check our web page to see that your memory
and power supply are on the "approved" list.  It strikes me as quite
unlikely that you are having a cpu design or manufacturability problem.  MB,
maybe.  Memory or power supply--check first.
