I counted 9 chips on the DIMMS, so I'm assuming ECC.  Strangest looking
DIMM I've ever seen, though; it looks like 2 DIMM's sandwiched together
with one of them plugged in.  So, 256M RAM in 1 DIMM, with 2x2x9=36 chips.
I also noted something in my other replies I forgot to mention before; the
box is solid for weeks with a UP kernel, but 2-3 days SMP.
I'll run memtest86.
regards,
	David
