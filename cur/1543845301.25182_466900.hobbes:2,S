True enough.  Thanks for the patch.
However, in this case, the single-printed MAC address still needs
a \n, with the IRQ on a separate line (wasting vertical screen space),
or it needs a custom printk() that is all done at one time.
Probably the latter IMO.  Oh, it looks like your patch
has a way to handle that too.  Good.
What happened to your patch?
