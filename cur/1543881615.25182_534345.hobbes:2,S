My opinion: temperature measured in a watchdog device is created to be able to
react on a "system overheat" situation. For me this thus is a hwmon device and
thus should be done via the hwmon interface. And that seems to be in 
millidegree Celsius... (where the watchdog drivers used to do things in
Fahrenheit). I propose to follow the hwmon interface setup.
(BTW: My plans with the pcwd drivers is to 1) get one driver that is maintained
in the kernel instead of a basic driver in the kernel and an extended one that
is maintained seperately, 2) convert the pcwd.c driver to the isa_driver,
3) change temperature stuff to hwmon interface and 4) create a sysfs equivalent
for the /proc interface.)
I will take all your other comments/input and rework the code so that it is up
to the kernel standards.
Greetings,
Wim.
