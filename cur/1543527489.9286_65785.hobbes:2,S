Ouch!  That many?  Well, I'd never personally use them all, but I
think that having the kernel support that many is a good idea if
someone out there wants that many.  Isn't it just a #define you
can change?

Or if not swapped out, then how about a scrollback buffer
ager?  Lets say after the last operation that put data in
scrollback on a VC a timer activates which counts down.  If
something else scrolls it resets the timer.  If nothing scrolls,
then after a programmable time - the buffer is flushed and the
memory returned to the pool.
That would work fine for me.  I'd set my timeouts at around 15-20
minutes.

I think it is more a question of:  Does the person wanting that
big a scrollback buffer agree that is is ok that it takes up X
megs of unswappable memory?  If they think it is ok, why not let
them choose that.  If a better solution could be found, it would
be great, but I'd rather lose a few megs than get stuck with the
single scrollback buffer there is now.  2.0.x had separate
buffers on each console.  They were small, and the more VC's you
had the smaller they were, but they were useful.

13683 tty8     SW     0:00 [bash]
Bash is swapped out on my machine.  ;o)  I have another box that
has several shells swapped out.
