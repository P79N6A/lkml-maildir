Well no.  When the kernel wants to change the hardware page tables it
doesn't even try to do it itself, it calls the hypervisor via the
"hypervisor system call" instruction.  It's entirely analogous to a
program calling the "write" system call to send output to a terminal
rather than trying to drive the serial port directly (via outb
instructions or whatever).

Not really.  Not any more than the Windows kernel is a "magic binary
blob" in a GPL'd program running under Windows.

Wow, you must have been really tired when you wrote that... :)

It's quite clear that (a) being in a separate address space (b) having
a defined, documented interface and (c) being used by multiple
different client OSes is pretty good evidence that something is an
independent work, not a derived work of the kernel, and therefore not
subject to the GPL.
