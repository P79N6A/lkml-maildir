Indeed. 
A zero-length /bin/true does not work reliably, and never has.  That's
why it's not zero-length any more (not on any modern system I know of,
anyway).  You need to have the magic "#!/bin/sh" part to make it be
reliably recognized as a shell script.
However, making it do anything but a simple "exit 0" is horrible. 
Anybody who really thinks /bin/true should report a version number and a
help string (or even a copyright notice) needs to get his head examined. 
Yes, the FSF coding style says it should do it.  But you should never
let rules overrule common sense - if you do, you end up doing stupid
things (this is _especially_ true of the FSF codingstyle - see the
kernel Documentation/CodingStyle about some other issues).
