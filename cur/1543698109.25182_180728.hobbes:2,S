I can't agree. I've had experiences with two Epox mobos - 8RDA+ running
2.6-test kernels and 8RDA3+ running 2.4.22 kernel.
Both of them locked completely up sometimes (that was after week or so
without reboot). It seems that compiling Local-APIC out of kernel has
stopped this behaviour. It's been about a month without lockups for 2.4
machine. 2.6 hasn't locked up either but it gets a new kernel and a reboot
every week anyway.
Actually the machine with 2.4 kernel run initially 1.5 months without a
glitch (and Local-APIC compiled in) before it started to lock up weekly. I
don't know why. Anyway as I said disabling Local-APIC has stopped all those
lockups.
