Bug:
	1. key = q->key copies bad key, while it is being changed.
	2. That makes the spin_lock() irrelevant.
	3. match_futex() compares word by word against another bad
	   key, while it is being changed again (by a second futex_requeue).
	4. It can match even though the key is wrong.
For example, say the first requeue changes q->key from (1,2) to (3,4).
key = q->key could read (1,4).
Say the second requeue changes q->key from (3,4) to (1,5).
match_futex() could read (1,4) and pass the test, even though (1,4)
is never a valid key.
