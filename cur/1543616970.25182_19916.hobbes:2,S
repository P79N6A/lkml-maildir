Ah, yes. That was a patch someone sent to me years ago, and got
included in the jumbo devfs patch. There's a boot parameter which
allows you to control the allocation of host numbers.
So how about in scsi_host_no_init() we call alloc_unique_number() N
times until we've allocated the required number of host numbers for
manual control. These will never be freed. Then all other host
allocations can be done dynamically. We would just need a flag in the
host structure to disable deallocation of the number if it's one of
the reserved numbers.
