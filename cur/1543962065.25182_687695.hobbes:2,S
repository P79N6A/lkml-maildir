This has an absurd presumption that something is only stable when
there are zero problems with it.
Fault free software, except in extremely trivial examples, does not
exist in nature.
BTW, this points out another BS aspect of your BSD fan-boy crap,
the BSD userbase is only a tiny fraction of how many people use
Linux.  So you can't even compare the number of outstanding problem
reports between the two.
