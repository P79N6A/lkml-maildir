Subject: [PATCH] __cfq_get_queue() fix for 2.6.12-rc5

Hello,
I resend this e-mail, as it may not be sent properly.
Please excuse me, if you receive same one.
I found a possible bug by which the first get_request() for a process
fails in cfq I/O scheduler.
If it's a bug, please consider to apply the patch for 2.6.12-rc5 below.
When cfq I/O scheduler is selected, get_request() in __make_request()
calls __cfq_get_queue().
__cfq_get_queue() finds an existing queue (struct cfq_queue) of the
current process for the device and returns it.  If it's not found,
__cfq_get_queue() creates and returns a new one if __cfq_get_queue()
is called with __GFP_WAIT flag, or __cfq_get_queue() returns NULL
(this means that get_request() fails) if no __GFP_WAIT flag.
On the other hand, in __make_request(), get_request() is called
without __GFP_WAIT flag at the first time.
Thus, the get_request() fails when there is no existing queue,
typically when it's called for the first I/O request of the process
to the device.
Though it will be followed by get_request_wait() for general case,
__make_request() will just end the I/O with an error (EWOULDBLOCK)
when the request was for read-ahead.
The patch for 2.6.12-rc5 is below:
