Sorry, I forget to look for that, but:
I have the following line in /etc/modules/conf:
alias char-major-108 ppp_async
alias tty-ldisc-3 ppp
alias ppp0 ppp_generic
alias ppp1 ppp_generic
alias ppp ppp_generic
alias ppp-compress-18 ppp_mppe
alias ppp-compress-21 bsd_comp
alias ppp-compress-24 ppp_deflate
alias ppp-compress-26 ppp_deflate
So it should be autoloaded. I've added now "probe tty-ldisc-3 ppp_async
ppp" and hope it helps.
So, if ppp_async gets not autoloaded, why? And why does'nt this happen
not allways but only sometimes?
Bye,
Manfred
