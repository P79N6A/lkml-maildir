Are you planning on merging sil_m15w workaround?
FYI, from the first time it was submitted (last summer) till 2.6.16, it 
took very little effort to maintain it.  The current big update would 
necessitate some changes to it but I don't think it will be too much 
work.  My experience says m15w doesn't add too much maintenance overhead.
Also, what's the merge plan for hotplug/PM?  Together into 2.6.18?  Or 
are we looking further down?
