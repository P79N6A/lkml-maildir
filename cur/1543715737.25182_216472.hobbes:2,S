Funny, this reminds me of VGA BIOSes which put "IBM Compatible" at the right
location, because lots of programs were looking for "IBM" to check if this
way such a bios. Same check, same workaround :-) I hope they have patented
this trick so that they will be the only ones using it :-)

What would be smarter would be to try to understand why they do this. At
the moment, it seems to me that their only problem is to taint the kernel.
Why ? I don't this that any old modutils/module-utils found in any distros
don't load properly such modules. So perhaps they only want not to taint
the kernel because it appears dirty to their customers who will not receive
any more support from LKML. So perhaps what we really need is to add a new
MODULE_SUPPORT field stating where to get support from in case of bugs,
oopses or panics on a tainted kernel. Thus, the module author would be able
to insert something such as "support_XXX@author.com" which will be displayed
on each oops/panic/etc... Even if this is a long list because the customer
uses connexant, nvidia, checkpoint and I don't know what, at least he will
get 3 email addresses for his support. And it might reassure these authors
to know that the customer will ask them before asking us with our automatic
replies "unload your binary modules...".
Anyway it now seems like strings will have to be matched on their lenghts...
Regards,
Willy
