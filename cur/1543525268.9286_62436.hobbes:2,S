I'm experiencing general instability with my new Athlon system under linux.
It seems that any heavy disk access causes problems.  I've also experienced
hard lockups under X, and _really_ strange problems, where things like IP
masq/forwarding were still working, but I couldn't do anything on the local
box.
My system is the following:
FIC SD-11 Motherboard
Athlon 650MHz Processor
PC Power & Cooling TurboCool 300 Power Supply (AMD Approved)
128M Micron 8ns SDRAM
Riva TNT PCI / VooDoo3 2000 AGP (experienced same problems with both)
Diamond FirePort 40 SCSI card.  This card was rock solid in my old system.
I'm running kernel 2.2.14.  My kernel is set to PPro/6x86 for the processor.
I'm running Debian potato.
Just now, I tried to tar up my home directory and I got the following error.
This is just an example of the errors.  I've gotten similar errors during
fsck's, and other operations.
