Subject: Interface matching of firewall forwarding rules

We have just noticed something curious when examining the 
CONFIG_IP_FIREWALL_VERBOSE outputs of onw of our firewalls.
It seems that packets rejected by forwarding rules are done so
based on their outgoing interface, rather than the incoming one.
The behaviour seems to apply to kernel 2.0.36 and 2.2.1pre4.
This seems counter-intuitive, I would expect the firewall code to 
match the interface that the packet was received on. 
The docs for ipchains and ipfwadm are ambiguous, stating that 
matches occur based upon the "name of an interface via which a 
packet is received, or via which is packet is going to be sent." 
Can anyone offer a rationale for this behaviour?
Thanks,
Damien Miller
