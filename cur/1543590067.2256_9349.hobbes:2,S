Albert, you can't be serious. The system had demand-loading for almost
ten years. ->size - ->resident can be huge with no swap at all. As in,
"box had never been subjected to swapon(8)".
	That value is a  mix of amount of stuff we hadn't paged in,
amount of stuff we had paged in but then dropped (e.g. code that
had never been touched for two weeks, since application only uses
it on startup) and amount of stuff that had been swapped out _and_
wasn't swapped in (it may very well stay in swap).
	BTW, "shared" is also bogus - page_count(page) can be raised
by any number of things.

Depends on that applications mix.
