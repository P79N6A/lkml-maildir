Yes, if we all could agree on _which_ compression and encryption
algorithm(s) we want to use. It goes beyond that too, where do you
want to save the image? In the swap device or a regular file? And
don't forget about debuggability either. It's faster to do a
snapshot/resume without shutdown/restart in the middle or just do a
snapshot, and examine its contents.
