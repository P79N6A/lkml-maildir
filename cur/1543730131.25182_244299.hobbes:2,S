There _are_ cases where a kernel patch sneaked to a subsystem maintainer
has made it even when some of the "heads" said it was impossible.
The key is convincing a subsystem maintainer that the patch helps and
doesn't hurt. And that doesn't work with a rant and can sometime take a
kernel patch to show how it works.  A decent patch with a more decent
description works wonders - usually.
