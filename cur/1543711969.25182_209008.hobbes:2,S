I completely agree that long-term, md and emd need to be the same.
However, watching the pain that the IDE changes took in early 2.5, I'd
like to see emd be merged alongside md for the short-term while the
kinks get worked out, keeping in mind the desire to merge them
together again soon as that happens. 
Thanks,
Matt
