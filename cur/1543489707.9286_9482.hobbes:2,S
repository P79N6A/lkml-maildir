Hi!
 The onboard memory (expanded from 256kB to 8MB) of my GUSPnP soundcard 
 will not be fully recognized by the recent sound driver.
 Only the 256k are detected.
 cat /dev/sndstat say:
    OSS/Free:3.8s2++-971130
    Load type: Driver compiled into kernel
    Kernel: Linux solfire 2.2.3 #1 Tue Mar 9 07:45:15 1999 i586
    Config options: 0
    Installed drivers: 
    Type 4: Gravis Ultrasound
    Type 25: GUS PnP
    Type 37: Loopback MIDI Device
    Card config: 
    Gravis Ultrasound at 0x220 irq 15 drq 6,7
    Loopback MIDI Device drq 0
    Audio devices:
    0: GUS PnP (IWave) (DUPLEX)
    1: Ultrasound
    Synth devices:
    0: Gravis UltraSound PnP (256k)       <<<###!!!
    Midi devices:
    0: Gravis UltraSound Midi
    1: Loopback MIDI Port 1
    2: Loopback MIDI Port 2
    Timers:
    0: System clock
    Mixers:
    0: GUS PnP (IWave)
    1: Gravis Ultrasound
 The memory is definitely not demaged.
 If I can help in any other or additional way: please mail me!
 KEEP HACKING!
