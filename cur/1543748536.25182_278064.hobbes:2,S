The easy way to fix that issue is to take the whole diff and break off
pieces, with the remainder always as the last patch. That way the whole
set of changes stays pending and appears intact at the end of the series.
I will personally be held responsible for identifying the causes of
behavioral changes in the OOM killer, and am having to investigate
several instances of bad OOM killer behavior already, so I have to do
this anyway, and so it might as well be done for mainline.
