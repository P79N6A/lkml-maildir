Sorry, I have none.  But you're unlikely to get your changes
considered seriously unless you can avoid any new overhead your patch
has which is of this level.
We're busy trying to make these data structures smaller, and eliminate
atomic operations, as much as possible.  Therefore anything which adds
new datastructure elements and new atomic operations will be met with
fierce resistence unless it results an equal or greater shrink of
datastructures elsewhere or removes atomic operations elsewhere in
the critical path.
