Subject: How can I simulate disk failure on 2.4?

  I need some kind of way to fail a single disk partition (hdg8) while the
system is running, then reenable it.  It doesn't have to be general-purpose
and
I don't mind doing ugly hacks to the disk code to make it happen.
  I was thinking of putting a flag in /proc somewhere, along with some code
in generic_make_request like this:
  if (proc_fail_the_disk && bh->b_rdev == the_disk)
    do_something_to_the_request;
 What field could I change in the request that would make it fail without
causing too many side effects?  (I suppose I'd learn a lot by
just picking a likely field and whacking it, but I'm not sure I want to
try and debug the mess.)
 Is this even the right approach at all?
