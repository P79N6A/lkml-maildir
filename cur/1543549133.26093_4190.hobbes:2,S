I agree. The scsi subsystem has been like this for ages, and I've 
taken the task of cleaning it up.  The reason for not doing the 
_big_ patch right away, was because of the complextity of this
paticular layer. This complexity is _not_ needed, as the recent
changes to the network layer has taught us. In fact I think 
making the scsi layer behave more like the network layer 
in terms of initialization would benefit not only those hacking
on scsi, but all of those maintaining scsi host drivers.

I'll do this. I agree about the scsi_dev_init part. We _need_ one entry
point into each module (scsi/host/device). This change will actually
make some code a duplicate and therefore needs to be removed which
I consider a good ting.
