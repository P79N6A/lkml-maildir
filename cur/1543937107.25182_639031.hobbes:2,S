But it still doesn't look like it ought to be that way. Still, I'll try to make
this display e.g. <choice>=y instead.

I'm pretty convinced that drivers/usb/gadget/Kconfig isn't really
written properly:
The first choice contains a mixture of boolean and tristate values; all
of the tristate ones are auto-select values (i.e. such with no prompt),
which results in all of them being unavailable when the choice itself is
set to M (the default with the patch - previously, the choice type got
derived from just the first contained value's type, which was clearly
wrong). These prompt-less items should go after the choice (resulting
in the choice to become a boolean one), if they're needed at all (I
think, especially with the intended change, these options are just
pointless except for avoiding
#if defined(CONFIG_...) || defined(CONFIG_..._MODULE)'
in C sources. In that latter case, the choice could become a tristate
one, allowing all of the selections to be built at once as modules
(which really seems to be the way distro kernels would want to use
it) or any one of them to be built in (the current behavior, except
that at present even when using these as a module only a single
one can be selected).
The second choice appears suspicious altogether - is it really that
just any one of these items can be selected to be built into the
kernel? And again, there are items inside that choice that really
seem to belong outside - I think this is an abuse of the choice
construct, which just happened to work when the choice type (as
described above) was derived from only its first contained value.
Bottom line is, in order to suggest an appropriate adjustment to this
Kconfig file I need clarification on its intentions. Meanwhile I'll scan
the tree for other suspicious choices...
Thanks, Jan
