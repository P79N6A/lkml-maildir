Subject: [PATCH] remove sched.h dependancies from fs/
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/1/31/192

There's a large (90kb uncompressed) patch at 
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/davej/patches/2.5/misc/sched-cleanup-2.diff.gz
which removes the inclusion of sched.h from a majority of fs/
It achieves this by moving CURRENT_TIME to time.h, and including that instead.
(time.h pulls in a thousand times less files than sched.h)
The only remaining users of sched.h in fs/ with this patch applied are
various users of fields from current->, and those who want jiffies.
(Linus, I know you prefer these things sent directly, if this sounds good,
 and Al likes it, I'll push it to you inline).
Dave.
