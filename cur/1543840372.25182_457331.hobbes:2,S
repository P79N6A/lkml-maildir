What if a processor was already in a sleep state when a call to 
set_acceptable_latency() latency occurs?  Should there be a callback so 
they can be woken up?  A callback would also allow ACPI to tell the 
user "disabling C3 because of device <foo>" or somesuch, which might be 
nice.
Also, should subsystems have the ability to set a lower bound on  
latency?  That would mean set_acceptable_latency() could fail, 
indicating that the user should buy a better device or a system with 
better realtime guarantees, which is also valuable info.
Comments aside, this is a nice interface, should help clarify things for 
devices with response time limits.
Thanks,
Jesse
