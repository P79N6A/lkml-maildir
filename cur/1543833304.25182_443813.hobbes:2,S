I agree.
The reason for stopping this is that sys_sysctl at that location
in glibc is unnecessary, we can use uname now.
Currently that usage by glibc gives false positives if we want
to warn users.

I sent Andrew patches yesterday to put it in 
Documentation/feature-remove-schedule.txt, and to print a warning, and
to optionally compile out sys_sysctl.

I agree.  Part of that beyond the deprecated message is sending
patches to fixup the few remaining users and talking about it a lot
so even if someone doesn't run the kernels with deprecated message
they might notice something.

The core problem is enough people have read that depreciated warning
that the binary interface of kernel/sysctl.c is not being maintained
seriously.  So the code must move out of this half deprecated state.
Either to all of the way gone (preferably) or reinstated as an
interface that we are serious about maintaining.  Code that
bit rots and people don't care is a problem.

That is not a problem. glibc will happily fall back to reading
the values from /proc/sys/kernel/version if sysctl fails.  It
just makes more sense (to me at least) to use uname for
getting uname data.
