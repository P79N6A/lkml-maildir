Are you sure you need to change the flow handler depending on how
you program the device?
Since the outset of this design, I've had what are essentially edge
based interrupt sources using the "level" handlers because they haven't
had a "broken" edge implementation.  By that, I mean that the masking
is done in such a way that you miss edges when the source is masked.
If you do not miss edges while the source is masked, there's no point
in having the complexity of the "edge" based handler in the path - it
buys you nothing.  Just use the "level" handler instead.
