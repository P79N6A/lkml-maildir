Interesting data: it always hangs on the 4th iteration of Ctrl-Alt-F7, 
Ctrl-Alt-F2.  This smells like a bios stack overflow.  I think I'd better go 
poke at the vendor at this point, no?
I do feel Linux is exonerated, but then this just shows why we need to keep on 
moving, right on into the bios.
