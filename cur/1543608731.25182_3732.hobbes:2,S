the thing I don't like about it is the non-data-dependence, ie the
layout of the disk will actually depend on how long it took you to write
the tree.
I'm not saying it's a bad heuristic - it's probably a fine (and certainly
simple) one. But the thought that when the NFS server has problems, a
straight "cp -a" of the same tree results in different layout just because
the server was moved over from one network to another makes me go "Ewww.."
