The DPT is not the problem (I use them myself). See my other
messages on linux-kernel regarding RAID, Seagates and chunk
sizes. The caching strategy used by Seagate drives appears to
go to pieces when you read, skip, read, skip in anything other
than 32k chunks. The default RAID chunk size used by md is
not 32k...
