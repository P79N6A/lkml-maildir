Subject: [PATCH] Use page_to_pfn in BIO code

Hi,
While porting the DISCONTIGMEM code to ppc64 (in order to do NUMA memory
allocation) I noticed the bio code uses page_to_phys. We should instead
be using the recently introduced page_to_pfn code.
This now limits the direct usage of mem_map (at least on ppc64) to 
two spots - page_to_pfn/pfn_to_page which makes DISCONTIGMEM support
quite trivial.
