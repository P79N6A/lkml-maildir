  On all "workstation" boxes the largest process is most likely X server.
On all workstations, used by graphics artists two largest processes are
always X server and graphics editor. Since killing X server means that all
its clients will lose their display and will be killed in random state
(very likely without having reasonable means to preserve the data in
them), this kind of policy will make absolutely no sense.

  Killing Oracle, or any other server that depends on some process being
alive and keeping a valuable, complex, hard to recover data on disk and
in memory, is in some cases not any better than just blowing up the box.
