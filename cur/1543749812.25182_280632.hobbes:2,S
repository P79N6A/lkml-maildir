At this point were not looking at any kernel symbols at all. The driver 
is intended indeed as a userspace driver, depending heavily on the 
userspace libs available. I personally would go to kernel space only if 
perfomance issues arise. Or maybe if implementing an ALSA kernel space 
driver would be easier than implementing it in user space (small chance).
So wrt to the kernel symbols, I personally don't mind them changing... I 
have to learn them from scratch anyway (as you point out).
And should we be implementing some sort of kernel driver, chances are 
that it will only implement the AMDTP packaging and ISO transport. 
Connection management and other non-RT tasks will most likely remain in 
user space, based upon well-tested libs. So the number of interface 
functions used will be rather small, and they will probably be available 
anyway because other drivers also use them.
And isn't driver writing a bit of kernel hacking anyway? As far as I 
know, you have to be very aware of kernel issues/internals when writing 
a driver...
