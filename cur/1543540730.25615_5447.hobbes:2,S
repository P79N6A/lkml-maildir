Hi, 
I have a machine here with Serial console. I just tried sending break
to activate the magic sysrq, but it didn't work. I verified I'm
sending the break correctly, but I'm not getting the menu.

Hmmm. OK. I dropped "console on VT" support, but left VT enabled. 
I thought I had taken out VT support completely. 
On the other hand, the machine doesn't have a video card, so all
the VTs give "IO error"s.
