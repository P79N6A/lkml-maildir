I'm using the cryptsetup tool (from 
http://www.saout.de/misc/dm-crypt/
):
echo $KEY | cryptsetup -c aes-cbc-essiv:sha256 -h plain -s 256 create data /dev/vg0/data
$KEY contains 32 bytes of binary data. Do you need any other information? Here's all I can think of:
- parition /dev/vg0/data lies on a lvm2 volume group
- this volume group lies on a 4-disk software-raid 5 array
- size of the partition is 300 GB
- padlock aes works on kernel 2.6.15.4 but not on 2.6.16-rc1
- aes_i586 works on all kernels
Thanks,
Michael
