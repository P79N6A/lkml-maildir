hello,
(i've posted a similar message before but i've been told to add the whole error
message, so here it is. sorry about that, but typing screenfulls of hex numbers
makes me feel like a geek but it also makes my head hurt ;)
the 2.5.67 kernel boots fine here, but the -ac1 patch to it ends up in 
a kernel panic.
here are the last 25 lines of the error, i don't know if there is more above of it,
scrolling up didn't work... (btw there can be typos in it ;)
Process swapper (pid: 1, threadinfo=dbf8e000 task=dbf8c040)

 <0>Kernel panic: Attempted to kill init!
The machine is a p3 700 with 448MB of ram, and it's running an old scsi 
disk at an adaptec 2940
controller that uses the aic7xxx drivers (at boot it says AIC7870).
When configuring (make menuconfig) the kernel, i loaded the saved 
config file that worked for 2.5.67.
Note: i am not subscribed to the lkml, perhaps i will later on, when 
i'm more experienced.
so, please email me at the_sithlord@yahoo.com
you can also drop by in my undernet channel called #hansapils
any help regarding this problem would be highly appreciated.
greetings, chris
