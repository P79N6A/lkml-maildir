Hi Chris.

Not if it's done correctly - try using lines similar to the following
in /etc/fstab on your system:
 Q> /dev/hda1	/win95	vfat	defaults,noexec		0 0
Note that "noexec" which turns off the x attributes on files, but
leaves them turned on for directories so you can get at the files
therein.

If it's done correctly, that shouldn't happen anyway.
Best wishes from Riley.
