Ok, that sounds good. Some of that is obviously already in separate files 
already, even if they then just get #include'd into the main sched.c, so 
yeah, splitting it up along those lines makes sense.

I'd love to see some of that too, but I suspect that with something like 
the scheduler, it's hard to have any reasonable (and working!) points that 
make much sense. At some point, the changes to make it work incrementally 
get bigger than the patches themselves, and rather than show what's going 
on, it might _hide_ what's going on.
