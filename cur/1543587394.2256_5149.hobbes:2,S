Uh...  I do know about this map, but I wonder if it is at all needed. 
What is the real difference between a logical cpu and the physical one. 
Or is this only interesting if the machine is not Smp, i.e. all the cpus
are not the same?  It just seems to me that introducing an additional
mapping just slows things down and, if all the cpus are the same, does
not really do anything.  Of course, I am assuming that ALL usage would
be to the logical :)
