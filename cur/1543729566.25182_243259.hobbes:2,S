Did /mnt run out of space while doing that?  Or nearly?  There's
a known issue with that area of the XFS code, in conjunction with
4K stacks at the moment - was that enabled in your .config?
Looks like something stamped on parts of the xfs_mount structure
for the filesystem mounted at /mnt, a stack overrun would explain
that and your subsequent oopsen.
cheers.
