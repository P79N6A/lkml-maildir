No offense, but that kind of attitude is harmful to the progression of making Linux a good operating system.
Our products NEED suspend/resume to work properly.  PERIOD.  I just spent a few days fixing some bugs in the Tulip driver with suspend/resume, and now your telling me that it's ok to change the API because no one is using it?  So if people ARE using the suspend/resume calls they are just SOL?  Sorry, I don't think things work well that way.
These sort of changes should either wait until 2.5 OR wait until EVERYONE has time to change ALL the drivers so that things don't get broken when you change the API.
2.4.x is supposed to be a "stable" series of kernels.  Thus far, I have NOT been impressed with its stability.
