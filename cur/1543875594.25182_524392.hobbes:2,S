Right.  However if this is what Thomas was seeing the problem turned
out to be an issue with pci_enable_device changing the irq number.
It just happens that now the code cares, so the bug is found.
Marcus any chance I could see an oops?  Or you could try the patch I
previously posted when debugging this with Thomas.
I'm going to clean that patch up and send it along in hopes that it
helps anyway and see where we land.
