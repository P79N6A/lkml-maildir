Hi Matt, I agree that it should be 0x45 everywhere.  After thinking a bit
I concluded that the
#if defined(__LITTLE_ENDIAN_BITFIELD)
        __u8    ihl:4,
                version:4;
#elif defined (__BIG_ENDIAN_BITFIELD)
        __u8    version:4,
                ihl:4;
in the definition of struct iphdr is to make sure that compiler uses the
first four bits of the byte to refer to version, rather than the last four;
and this only matters when you are accessing the nibbles via the ihl
or version structure fields.  Thus it makes sure that if you write 0x45
to the byte, then version will return 4 and ihl will return 5.  Presumably
the C standard specifies how bitfield expressions should be laid out
in the byte, and ihl:4, version:4; gives opposite results on little-endian
and big-endian machines...
Ciao,
Duncan.
