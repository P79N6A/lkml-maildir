You mean your cleanup_thread would block for completion of the keventd 
stuff? Ok, this would work. But then, when calling cleanup_thread, f.e. we 
must not hold any semaphore which might be acquired by _any_ other work 
scheduled for keventd or we might end in deadlock (like the rtnl+hotplug 
issue we had seen recently).

I thought this was fixed in 2.5 for some time now, but seems I shouldn't 
rely on that ;-)

Personally I do like the complete_and_exit thing as a simple and clear 
finalisation point. And if I didn't miss something above wrt. your 
cleanup_kthread being synchronous I'm not sure whether the locking 
implication do really make things easier - YMMV of course.
Thanks.
