If I have mailed this note to the wrong group then I apologize. My problem
is that while trying to install both Red Hat 5.1 and 5.2 from CDROM the
install boot posts this message after accessing and reading from the CDROM
drive:
"Install exited abnormally -- received signal 11
sending termination signals...done
sending kill signals...done
unmounting filesystem...
	/tmp/rhimage
	/proc
you may safely reboot your system"
The system is a P133 w/ 32 MB RAM, 1.2 GB hd and an Adaptec 2940 SCSI
controller.
CDROM drive is in fine shape while in use under DOS. Problem occurs with
SCSI controller in/out of the system.
TIA
Grant
