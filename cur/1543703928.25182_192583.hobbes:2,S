Duh... You're right. Sorry...

  1) your testcase is missing an fflush() call before the gettimeofday()
in case 2
  2) In any case, fflush() does not actually ensure the data has been
written out to disk: it just schedules the writes (man 3 fflush). If you
actually want to measure write performance, you need to add fsync()
after the fflush().
So here's the difference:
-------------------------
On a Solaris machine:
Without fflush+fsync:
bash-2.05$ ./a.out
Creating file: 9.933 seconds
Updating file: 4.382 seconds
With fflush, but no fsync:
bash-2.05$ ./a.out
Creating file: 9.852 seconds
Updating file: 1.459 seconds
With fflush+fsync:
bash-2.05$ ./a.out
Creating file: 9.915 seconds
Updating file: 10.639 seconds
------------------------
Now on Linux 2.6.1-mm3:
Without fflush+fsync:
[trondmy@hammerfest gnurr]$ ./a.out
Creating file: 3.475 seconds
Updating file: 0.561 seconds
With fflush, but no fsync:
[trondmy@hammerfest gnurr]$ ./a.out
Creating file: 3.275 seconds
Updating file: 1.642 seconds
With fflush+fsync:
[trondmy@hammerfest gnurr]$ ./a.out
Creating file: 3.780 seconds
Updating file: 4.618 seconds
-----------------------------
Surprise! Linux and Solaris show exactly the same behaviour.
As I said before in 2.4.x we have a hard limit of 256 outstanding
requests before we have to wait on requests to complete. Remove that
limit, and all is well...
Cheers,
