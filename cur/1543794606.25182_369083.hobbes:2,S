I know you have tried to reproduce them and failed. The question was how
to go further?

Well I would be surprised the "cat >> titi" command does any of this
byte range lock. If the "create and later rewrite the same file"
sequence fails, with a simple cat command (cat > titi ... ^D; cat >>
titi), how can it works with complicated applications?

Yes : the system hangs when shutting down as the result of the "umount
-a"  with the last message being as described in bug N° 3237. I have to
press power button for 5 seconds.
NB : manually doing the umount does exactly the same things.

Will do that in the bug data.

Hanging a system systematically leading to FSCK on each reboot is not
particularly helpfull given the fact that it happens whebn you are doing
a shutdown in most cases.
