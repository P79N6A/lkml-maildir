No, drugged to my eye-brows.

I found a rather nasty race in my implementation - it's basically
impossible to triggerin real life, but quite frankly I don't want to have
semaphores that have a really subtle bug in them. 
However much I tried, I couldn't make the race go away without using a
spinlock in the critical path of the semaphore, something which I very
much want to avoid.
Unless I find a good recursive semaphore implementation (and I'm starting
to despair about finding one that is lock-free for the non-contention
case), I'll have to come up with something else (like letting only kswapd
swap out pages as has been discussed here).
