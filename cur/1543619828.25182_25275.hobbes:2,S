Subject: [PATCH] lk 2.5.3 advansys scsi driver
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/2/2/124

The advansys driver is getting better but will not compile
on a SMP machine due to a missing "&" on line 5874:
   spin_lock_irqsave(boardp->lock, flags);
The attachment fixes this and cleans up doco and compile
errors when ADVANSYS_DEBUG is defined.
The driver works fine on my UP and SMP boxes with lk 2.5.3
with this patch.
