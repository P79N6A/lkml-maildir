Richard; this lovely view of life works great for (and not meaning to 
belittle anybody's work here) small/self contained/trivial projects, 
characterised by unix tools/apps which can be managed by one or a few 
people in a reasonable timescale. I mean grep, sed, bison, dhcpd, 
sendmail etc
But what about bigger projects? As stated previously, I develop computer 
games. It takes 30+ people 2-3years continous effort and $3M - 10$M in 
cash to produce.
This just isn't viable, under your model. A group of part time hobbyists 
just aren't gonna complete a (non trivial) game in their lifetimes.
You say "the best thing you can do is not develop it at all. Someone 
else will develop a free program to do the job."
I sincerely doubt it.
Sorry staff. Richard says you are all out of a job.
