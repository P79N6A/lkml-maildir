Hi there,
        I couldn't seem to do 'make menuconfig' on 2.2.0pre4-ac2 .. I
narrowed
it down to scripts/lxdialog/Makefile ..
by removing '-lefence' from the line:
LDLIBS = -lncurses -lefence
.. I'm not sure if i stuffed up somewhere.. but it seemed to work after
that.. can someone explain why this happened? .. i'm not really an
expert at this stuff so maybe the above fix it completely wrong :)
Phil
