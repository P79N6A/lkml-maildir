From the report sent to me a while ago (from Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>)
[Sorry Marc for not replying sooner.]  I think the problem was that
when the APM driver realises that there are two (or more) processors,
it does not do any of the normal connection setup with the BIOS and so
the BIOS may just ignore any requests to gets from the driver.
Anyway, as a quick hack (i.e. I have not even compiled this)
can you try this: (a patch of arch/i386/kernel/apm.c from 2.2.1)

If possible, run the kernel with "apm=debug,smp-power-off".
If this doesn't work, you could try moving the CONFIG_SMP code
either below the CONFIG_APM_DO_ENABLE (if you enable that config
option, or even further, below the code:
        if (((apm_bios_info.flags & APM_BIOS_DISABLED) == 0)
            && (apm_bios_info.version > 0x0100)) {
                if (apm_engage_power_management(0x0001) == APM_SUCCESS)
                        apm_bios_info.flags &= ~APM_BIOS_DISENGAGED;
        }
Marc also said he added "apm_enabled = 1" just before returning in the
CONFIG_SMP check above, but I do not see how that could have affected
anything.
Cheers,
Stephen
