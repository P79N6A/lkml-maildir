That makes the problem slightly easier. If sparsemem sections are aware of 
whether they are hotpluggable or not, __rmqueue_fallback() (from the 
list-based anti-frag patches) can be taught to never use those sections 
for unmovable allocations.

Which should be doable.

I'm aware of this. It believe it could all be done in the context of 
list-based - just that it requires more code. Zones are easier to 
understand for most people and their behavior is better understood. If a 
workload is discovered that list-based doesn't handle, the zone can be 
used until the problem is solved.
This is why the anti-fragmentation and zone-based approaches are no longer 
mutually exclusive as they were in earlier versions.
