If you don't want to poll periodically for network stats, as has
been repeatedly suggested, you can always poll periodically for the
64-bit NIC-specific stats that most gige adapters provide these days,
using ethtool.  NIC-specific stats also tend to provide more fine
granularity than the current net_device_stats members.
