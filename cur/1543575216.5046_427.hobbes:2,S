Please accept all my apologies, Alan. When I quickly
sent you the last patch, I didn't notice that some
other broken code had been removed, what I discovered
later back home and after comparing 2.2.18pre2[15]
(what Miquel noticed too).
Next time, I'll spend a little more of my time on
carefully reading the patch before resending an old
useless one.
Cheers,
Willy
