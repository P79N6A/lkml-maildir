Do such controllers lock up on PIO draining after PIO transfers too?
Can you tell which are those controllers?

Draining is related to the amount of data the drive responds not to the
chunk size.  I agree 64k should be enough for most cases but I think
there can be corner cases where this doesn't hold.
Thanks.
