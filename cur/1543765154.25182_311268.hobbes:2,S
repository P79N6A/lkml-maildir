Yes you do. You took care of the simple case. Things get funnier
when you own more than one PI lock, or you need to promote a
task that is blocked on other PI locks whose owners are blocked
on PI locks (transitivity), or when you mix PI and PP (priority
protection/ priority ceiling).
In that case not having a sim{pl,g}e API for doing it is nuts.

Wrong. Fusyns are kernel locks that are exposed to user space (much as
a file descriptor is a kernel object exposed to user space through
a system call). Of course if the user does something mean with them
they will cause an error, but should not have undesired consequences
in the kernel. But BUGS in the code will be as unclear as in RT mutexes.

Ayeh for the big...it is not that confusing :)
