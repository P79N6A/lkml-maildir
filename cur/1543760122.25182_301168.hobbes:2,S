Hello,
While installing DCE 0.1.13 on RH Linux AS 2.1 Kernel 2.4.18-e.54smp
running on Itanium, the system hangs and becomes unbootable. It then has
to be started in single user mode, the dce rpm has to be removed and
then booted. This happens with kernel patch 52/54. 
Has anyone faced a similar problem and resolved it ? . Any pointers in
this regard will be really *nice*.
Thanks in advance.
