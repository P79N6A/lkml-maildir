this shows you're having various types of really bad things going on, like PCI
master aborts and the like. Those would certainly be a factor in waking the cpu up;
they're basically hardware exceptions, and I can totally believe (would need to find out
from hw guys how this works in practice) that this sort of serious error would keep the
cpu out of deep C states until resolved.
