I presume you are talking about Roman's tool, so I'll let him answer.  I
think he just implemented a converter to a new language, so new language

features. Although you can do a lot with config.in info, "everything I
need" is something a human needs to define in many cases.

This is a policy decision.  I'm not sure one -wants- to do this... 
Doing something like this blindly can have unintended side effects, i.e.
violate the Principle of Least Surprise.
