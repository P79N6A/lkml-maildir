Verrry eeeenteresting (showing my age):
Kdiff3 if fantastic. Looked at the entire source tree for -rt1 and -rt7. Found 
nothing changed touching any of the "oopses" that I have seen. What has been 
added, however, seems to be the trace-back code to display them. (Hypervisor 
code has been removed but my PIII clunker has no kvm support in any event.)
Am I correct?
These displayed "oopses" are problematic or simply debugging messages?
They seem to not have effected anything outside of my log files :-)
Safe to ignore them and keep using -rt7 or wait on this?
