Exactly what has been said to you the whole time, but you still refuse to 
accept that. If Linus develops and runs his code on a PowerPC and I struggle 
to install the code that he has released for me to modify and share on a 
PowerPC (maybe because I'm an idiot). Should I create a license with a 
Linusation term, because he is evil he runs his code on a PowerPC and I 
can't?
