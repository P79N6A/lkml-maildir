No overhead at all for directories 1 block in size.  The htree code uses
the existing "search leaf block" code for such a directory directly.
For directories > 1 block in size, you have the index (1 block
overhead), but also the benefit that you are only searching 1/N of the
blocks for an entry (the leaf block searching code remains the same,
just the "which block to search" code is activated.
So, in summary, htree is never slower than an un-indexed directory, so
there is never really a time when you wouldn't want to use it.
Cheers, Andreas
