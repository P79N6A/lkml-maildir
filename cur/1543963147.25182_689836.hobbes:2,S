HPA asked about why they used a whitelist instead of a blacklist in [1]. The 
answer (in [2]) was that those are the CPU's that are guaranteed to properly 
support PAT (no known or potential errata). However in [3] Dean Gaudet 
complained about the AMD detection code having a limit that the Intel 
detection code did not. Perhaps changing the 'c->x86 <= 0x11' test in the 
X86_VENDOR_AMD block to not exist?

                     ^^^^^---- Here in Rene's patch...
Wouldn't this be better if written the same as the Intel side, ie:
if (c->x86 >= 0xF && (c->x86 == 6 && c->x86_model == 7))
(or even with c->x86_model >= 7  ?)
