Sorry for the delay, I was off before New Year and then could not test
it ...

I do not think you need it. Either interrupt waked up somebody and set
need_resched and we exit loop or nobody is ready to run and we can sleep
again. Why complicate things any more than needed?

It does not work and I am very surprised it works for somebody (well,
there are conditios when it will work). By default pm_idle is always
NULL so we *never* actually call kernel function that really stops CPU.
Main idle task is cpu_idle that does
if (pm_idle)
   pm_idle()
or
   default_idle
and CPU is halted in default_idle. So your patch just enters busy loop
calling BIOS APM Idle over and over again just like it was before.
Attached patch makes apm_cpu_idle do the same and call either old
pm_idle (a.k.a. sys_idle) or default_idle. I removed your interrupt
handling - it does not actually affect the problem but it still is not
needed IMHO. t1, t2 are changed from int into long because jiffies is
long - not sure if it is really needed.
cheers and sorry for delay
