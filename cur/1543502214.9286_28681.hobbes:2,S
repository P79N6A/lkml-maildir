Basically what this type of application needs is regular repetitive scheduling.
A "wake me up at XXHz intervals" facility would make a lot of these types of
applications smooth and efficient. You would need some complexity to deal with a
heavily loaded machine. I think simply skipping some scheduling events on a
loaded machine would give the most tolerable result for most applications. In
this case it would help the application if it were informed how many scheduling
events have been missed since the last scheduling.
