The TCP/IP checksum is a WORD sum (unsigned short) in which
any overflow out of the word causes the word to be incremented.
The final sum is then inverted to become the checksum. Note that
many algorithms sum into a long then fold-back the bits. It's
the same thing, different method.
Therefore:
	Given an existing checksum of 0xffff, if the
	next word to be summed is 0x0001, the result
	will be 0x0001 because adding 1 to 0xffff makes
	it 0, causing an overflow which propagates to
	become 0x0001.
So:
	Clearly, information is lost because one doesn't
	know how the 0x0001 was obtained.
If I were to modify a low byte somewhere by subtracting 1,
would I know that the new checksum, excluding the inversion,
was 0x0000? No. It could be 0xffff.
This presents a problem when trying to modify existing checksums.
It's certainly easier to set the existing checksum to 0, then
re-checksum the whole packet. It's probably faster than some
looping algorithm that attempts to unwind a previous checksum.
