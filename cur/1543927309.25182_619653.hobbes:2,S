Not sure where that number came from.
In my tests some time ago NUMA overhead on SMP was minimal.
This was admittedly with old 2.4 kernels. There have been some doubts about
some of the newer NUMA features added; in particular about NUMA slab;
don't think there was much trouble with anything else -- in fact the trouble
was that it apparently sometimes made moderate NUMA factor NUMA systems 
slower too. But I assume SLUB will address this anyways.
