That is not the same as saying the write buffers are flushed and wholly 
visible to their destination, it just means that subsequent reads or 
writes will not be reordered prior to the sfence instruction.  It is 
entirely possible that the writes will remain in buffers on the CPU until 
well after the sfence instruction has executed, sfence only affects the 
order in which they become visible on the bus.  If you want to force a 
flush, a read from the PCI device is the only way to accomplish that.
