[SNIP schematics]
>Best wishes from Riley.
Thanks for putting the fragments together into a single
schematic!  It looks much clearer to me now.  I'll play with it
sometime soon.
BTW, you have wonderful ASCII schematic diagram abilities!!  ;o)
Since we've abused the list a bit over this, I feel obligated now
to write a Linux device driver for it, and put it all on a
webpage.  ;o)
When I get it all working, I'll do something like that.  Maybe
it'll get in 2.3.x sometime.... ;o)
Take care!
Anyone else interested in this circuit, etc.. should email me
privately, and I'll provide you with an email when I've got a
functional prototype.  Then you can go to the URL and get the
schems, etc...
