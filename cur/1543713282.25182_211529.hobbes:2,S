Iwamot and I are working on this. We'll post it soon.

I guess aruguments src_node, mm and pte would be redundant since
they can be looked up from old_p with the reverse mapping scheme.

Re-schan plicy would be much better since migrating pages is heavy work.
I don't think that holding mm->page_table_lock for long time would be
good idea.
How do you think about following algorism:
  1. get mm->page_table_lock
  2. chose some pages.
  3. release mm->page_table_lock
  4. call remap_onepage() against each page.
  5. goto step1 if there remain pages to be migrated.
