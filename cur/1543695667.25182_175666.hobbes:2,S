this doesnt look bad. i see 1 tx packet and some rx packets.  how
did you test this interface?  does tcpdump show anything?  could you
be more specific about this configuration so i could try to duplicate
your setup?  the nicstar driver seems to work for me in the 2.4.23-pre8
kernel (ilmid, signalling).  i tested the clip module as well but that
was via an arp server not clip over a pvc.
>Counters on all atm interfeces are still the same
what does atmdiag show?

these message were eliminated since they arent very useful and
quite noisy.
