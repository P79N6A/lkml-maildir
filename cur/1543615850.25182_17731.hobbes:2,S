That would do it, but I was trying to give a real-world example from
image processing, like copying a large image file.

I use FFTW from 
http://www.fftw.org
.

Imagine a 16384 by 16384 array of double complex values. That's a 4
GByte image. Scale down to fit your machine, of course :). The first
pass will do an FFT on every row (column) if your language is C
(FORTRAN). The "stride" is 16 bytes (one complex value) in the inner
loop. Each row (column) is 16384*16 = 262144 bytes long, which works out
to 64 pages if the page size is 4096 bytes.
Then the second pass will do an FFT on every column (row). The stride is
16384*16 = 262144 bytes. This is a new page for each 16-byte complex
value you process :-). That is, all 16384 pages have to be in memory, or
swapped into memory if you've run out of real memory and the kernel has
swapped them out.
Please ... *don't* try to do this on a 512 MB machine and think that an
efficient VM is gonna make it work :),
