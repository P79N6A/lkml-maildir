Hi Howard,
Thanks for joining the discussion. One request, if I may,
can you retain the CC list on posts please?

Linux's SCHED_OTHER policy offers static priorities in the range [0..0].
I think anything else would be a bug, because from my reading of the
standards, a process with a higher static priority shall always preempt
a process with a lower priority.
And SCHED_OTHER simply doesn't work that way.
So sched_yield() from a SCHED_OTHER task is free to basically do anything
at all. Is that the kind of behaviour you had in mind?

You didn't explain why you can't use a mutex to do this. From
your brief description, it seems like a mutex might just do
the job nicely.

Actually it should still be fast. It may yield excessive CPU to
other tasks (including those that are reniced). You didn't rely
on sched_yield providing some semantics about not doing such a
thing, did you?
