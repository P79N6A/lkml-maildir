I got giant earfuls of the BSD issue from EricA. But, Dave, you are
more reasonable than some of the other X developers so I'm not putting
blame on you. I did notice that you didn't deny the part about zero
forward progress in the kernel.
I do stand by my opinion that building a driver bus so that three
independent drivers (fbdev, DRM, XAA/EXA) can simultaneously multitask
on a single piece of hardware is not a good design. It is a political
solution, not a technical one.
