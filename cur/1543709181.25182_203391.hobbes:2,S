I am using /etc/modprobe.conf and I don't load any modules manually.
This is mostly a module kernel, the only problem I'm having is with the
network.  2.6.3 does work with the drivers compiled in (but not as
modules).  2.6.4-rc1 I can not get to work at all (modules or builtin).
Thanks for your suggestion.
Steve

One thing to make sure is that you're using /etc/modprobe.conf and don't
load the modules manually.
