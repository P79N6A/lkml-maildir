Without commenting one way or the other on the overall advisability
of this (for lack of sufficient clues), if we did this and renamed
"cpusets" to "containers", we would still want to export the /dev/cpuset
interface to just the CPU/Memory controllers.  Perhaps the "container"
pseudo-filesystem could optionally be mounted with a "cpuset" option,
that just exposed the cpuset relevant interface, or some such thing.
