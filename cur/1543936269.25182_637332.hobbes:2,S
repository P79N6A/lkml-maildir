Hello,
thanks a lot for replies.

I know, that interrupt lines are hardwired, but IMHO IOAPIC can assign
for every device on every hardwired line another IRQ. Am I right? I
think, that in this process can do some work BIOS. But I though, that
Linux can do similar work, when initializing hardware and can reassign
IRQ for certain device to another "number".
In BIOS of my motherboard there is no options like "IRQ for VGA" or
similar... :-( It's Gigabyte MA69G-S3H. I have already flashed newest
BIOS, which is on the Gigabyte web pages...
I suppose, that VGA card does not need unique IRQ, but programmers,
which wrote driver, want it. I can imagine, that VGA card have many
interrupts, especially in the OpenGL games, but I cannot assign unique
IRQ for VGA card at all :-(
But thank you for advice: I will try to send e-mail to Gigabyte and ask
they, if it possible to do change in the BIOS.
BTW: it is interesting: I had a Biostar TA690G motherboard and it behave
similar as Gigabyte: I cannnot assign unique IRQ to the external
graphics card... Chipsets of this motherboards are the same...
I've tried to solve this problem by bought of new motherboard: Gigabyte
MA790FX-DS5. I will see, if this board will behave as previous board...
