There isn't any program (except the example in the docs) that uses any
of these ioctls, and I'm writing patches to make this device available
through portable timer APIs like hrtimer/POSIX clocks/ALSA that are much
easier to use besides, so I think it would be a good idea to just
schedule these ioctls for removal.
