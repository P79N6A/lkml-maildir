Forgot to add.  This is important point: do NOT change current behavour wrt uevents,
ie, don't add uevents for current semantics at all.  Only send uevents (and in this
case it will be normal "add" and "remove" events) when assembling arrays "the new way",
using (stable!) /dev/mdcontrol misc device, after RUN_ARRAY and STOP_ARRAY actions has
been performed.
