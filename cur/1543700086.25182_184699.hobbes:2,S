No. Many SCSI drives and adapters allow queued commands and disconnect
operation.

Normal Unix/Linux file-systems write data to RAM. At some unknown
time, when memory gets tight, some data are written to the device.
Basically with Unix/Linux, you are using a RAM-Disk that overflows
to the physical media. There are special file-systems (journaling)
that guarantee that something, enough to recover the data, is
written at periodic intervals.
