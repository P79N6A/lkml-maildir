That is about the dumbest argument I've heard so far, sorry. With the
same argument, these people shouldn't be allowed to admin any computer
system and be given a broom to wipe the floor, and let the experts take
care of the world for them.
Now that's a perfectly reasonable line of thought, and I've most
certainly had it when it comes to HA and clusters myself, but in no
means is it a good reasoning against the _technology_. If it is simpler
to use, it will be simpler to use even for smart people, who can then
put more care into their security profiles instead of worrying about the
complexity.
