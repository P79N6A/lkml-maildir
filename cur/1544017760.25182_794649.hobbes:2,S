Tech sites are reporting everywhere a massive flaw in seagate drives that
can lock up the drive and make it unusable (the bios doesn't detect it, you
can't read the data). Haven't read anything about it here on the lists.
Seagate has ack'ed the problem:

So, apparently there're a lot of drives on the market (including mine)
that can die any day. Are those drives going to be blacklisted? It's
still not clear if the firmware update is safe (some affected but
working drives are dying after the firmware update), so some people
like me is still waiting (and hoping that the drive doesn't die) for
more stable firmware updates...
Here is the list of drives+firmware affected, according to the support site
as of now. Some models are still being diagnosed.
