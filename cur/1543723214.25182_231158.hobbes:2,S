I had kernel experts repeatedly insist to me that block devices were 
cached, while all of my tests (using dd to or from, say, /dev/sda1 or 
whatever) indicated that there was absolutely no caching whatsoever.
In my experience, reads and writes to block devices are uncached, while 
filesystem stuff IS cached.
