UML has been updated to 2.5.28 and UML 2.4.18-44.  The changes since 
2.5.27 include:
	A config reorganization and Makefile cleanups
	UML processes can pass notifications to mconsole clients via
/proc/mconsole
	SCSI now works.  The only low-level drivers available right
now is the in-memory scsi_debug driver.
	A batch of honeypot bugs were fixed
	I fixed some problems with hostfs, but it still doesn't work.
Since UML didn't make 2.5.27, I'll be sending this patch in to Linus.
The patch is available at
