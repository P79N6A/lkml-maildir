That's not evolution; it's de-evolution. Linux morphing to some sort of 
mentally-damaged pseudo-proprietary licence would be like switching back 
to a feudal society where 50 was considered unbelievably ancient.
I'm sure Linus did think very closely about the interaction of his code 
with proprietary licences. He thought about it, snickered for a few 
moments, and made the right decision.
