Lacking an explicitly stated license it can be argued that, since the 
MODULE_LICENSE() macro is meant to define the actual license on the code, 
this code is GPL. No, it isn't an explicit definition, but lacking any other 
signs of the license, the implicit declaration of it being GPL is (or should 
be) enough to deflect charges of copyright infringement.
