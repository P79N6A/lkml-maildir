Hi all,
I've two boxes with Dual Xeons 1.8 GHz and HT option enabled in BIOS. When 
I boot 2.4.20-rc2 with default arguments the kernel detects 4 processors and 
also reports 4 processors in /proc/cpuinfo wiht the "ht" feature.
However, if I boot with the "noht" option (wich I believed turned off HT 
and therefore only two processors should be available), the kernel still 
detects 4 processors, _but_ now the "ht" feature in /proc/cpuinfo is not 
there. Is this the intention of the "noht" option ? If so, are there any 
options available to turn off HT support in the kernel completely, so that 
I don't have to go into the BIOS to turn it off ?
If you want to I can provide the dmesg output and .config.
I think this issue is not just related to 2.4.20-rc2, but earlier kernels 
aswell.
Regards,
