And whats the point for this one?  TIOCGSERIAL is just some messy internals
of the old serial.c driver (and serial_core now) that's exposed for the
sake of setserial.  Given that the sn console is quite different I don't
see the point to emulate all the mess of a real serial driver - and if you
want to do so use the serial_core framework.
