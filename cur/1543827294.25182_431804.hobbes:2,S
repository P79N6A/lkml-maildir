Oops, you're right.  It emulates READ/WRITE6 at the top of the queuecommand
routine which made me thing it'll emulate more below.
So removing the READ/WRITE6 emulation and setting the flag so the midlayer
only uses READ/WRITE10+ is on top of the TODO list.  Right after that is
using the scsi_kmap_atomic_sg/scsi_kunmap_atomic_sg for the remaining
emulated commands.  More comments later.
