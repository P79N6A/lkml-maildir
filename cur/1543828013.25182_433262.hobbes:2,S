When you say we need to make this possible at the kernel side, do you
want the kernel not to accumulate taskstats in the do_exit() path
(avoid calling fill_xxxx routines) if there are no listeners
on TASKSTATS_LISTEN_GROUP? As Shailabh, mentioned sending out does not
happen if there are no listeners.
