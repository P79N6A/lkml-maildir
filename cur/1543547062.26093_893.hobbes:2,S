Alex,
'mkinitrd', which is in /sbin on my Mandrake 7.1 system can be used to 
create a new initrd.  'man mkinitrd' will tell you what you need to know 
about it.
Don't forget that lilo allows you to define multiple boot 
configurations.  An appropriate (second) entry in /etc/lilo.conf will set 
up your system so that you can choose to boot from your new 2.2.16 kernel 
or from your current 2.2.14 kernel.  If the new kernel won't boot, you can 
still get to (and use) the old kernel.
