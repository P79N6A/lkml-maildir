Well, I'm not sure.  First, we don't really know what the value of it should be
and this alone is a good enough reason for making it tunable, IMHO.  Second, I
think different systems may need different PAGES_FOR_IO and taking just the
maximum (even if we learn how much that actually is) seems to be wasteful in
the vast majority of cases.  Finally, I think it may be possible to speed up
image saving by increasing PAGES_FOR_IO without playing with the
image size and we can let the user try it (think of distro kernels that are
compiled for many different users).
Still, I'm not going to fight for that.

Okay, I'm going to prepare a patch along these lines.
