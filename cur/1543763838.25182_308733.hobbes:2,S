A few additional notes:
- The IP addresses for kernel.org have changed.  When the second
  server gets deployed next week, most of the kernel.org addresses,
  e.g. ftp.kernel.org, will be round-robins.  The individual servers
  can be specified as ftp1.kernel.org and ftp2.kernel.org.
- *** If you run a service from kernel.org that uses DNS entries
  beyond our control, please see the email I sent out; if you didn't
  get it, contact me. ***
- The old IP addresses will be turned off later this week.
