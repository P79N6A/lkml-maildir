hm.  Is this a fix against
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.23-rc1/2.6.23-rc1-mm1/broken-out/do_poll-return-eintr-when-signalled.patch
only, or does mainline also need fixing?
I guess the consequences of the thing-which-this-fixes aren't huge, s I ca
queue this up for 2.6.24, after Oleg's
do_poll-return-eintr-when-signalled.patch?

I spied this comment in there:
/*
 * We can actually return ERESTARTSYS instead of EINTR, but I'd
 * like to be certain this leads to no problems. So I return
 * EINTR just for safety.
 *
 * Update: ERESTARTSYS breaks at least the xview clock binary, so
 * I'm trying ERESTARTNOHAND which restart only when you want to.
 */
it is very old and perhaps is no longer relevant?
