 However, I can't understand the dependency upon the kernel version, etc...
 Let me steak on this question again. In my experiments I found the
 dependency on the keepalive setting for connection on 2.2.17:
   mtu 382 + keepalive yes -> loss
   mtu 382 + keepalive no  -> ok
 I made 2 tries for each setting. Does your model of "mss/mtu bug" cover
 such a picture? If the answer is "yes", I am almost satisfied. :-)
 If this behaviour is not deterministic, and is driven by probability,
 does it mean that I can get other results with large number of tests?
