like i do now with append noapic, it works ok
did some more tests today :
plugged the fasttrak tx4 into 3 different machines
all smp (dual p3/dual p2/dual xeon)
with all i get lost interrupts
if i boot with noapic problem is solved
(tried updating the bios for the promise, but doesn't help)
looks like there is really something wrong with the (bios?) tx4
i have 3 of these cards here
putting 2 together in an mainbord also doesn't work (then the tx4 bios is
complaining about no assigned irq)
and if i use 1 card in a system, i always have to press 'esc' to continu
after the bios tells me there is no array
i really think i should have bought the highpoint 4 port cards :(
