I have no intent of prosecuting either methods. I was simply pointing out
a fact. FWIW, both approachs can be used together, they are not (as I may
have mistakenly stated in previous debates) in contradiction.
Here are some random comments to be taken very lightly:

Sorry, I'm an avid LWN reader and haven't come accross something like this.
There are A LOT of benchmarks thrown left and right, mostly by embedded
distros wishing to push their own agenda. If what you assert is to hold,
then please at least provide us with a URL.

I've visited these issues before. It all boils down to a simple question:
is it worth making the kernel so much more complicated for such a minority
when 90% of the problems encountered in the field revolve around the
necessity of responding to an interrupt in a deterministic fashion?
And for those 90% of cases, a simple hyper-visor/nanokernel layer is
good enough. For the remaining 10% of cases, that's where something like
the rt-preempt or RTAI become necessary.

For most cases, as I said, there's no need for either rtai or rt-preempt,
all you need is direct access to the interrupt source, something a
hypervisor/nanokernel can easily provide you with. At its simplest, you
need two things:
- turning the core of the interrupt disabling defines into function pointers
- turning the core IRQ handler (do_IRQ) into a function pointer
Using this, a driver needing hard-rt can just tap into the interrupt flow
and get deterministic behavior WITHOUT either rtai, rt-preempt, or even
adeos. Of course, you can look for a clean implementation of this scheme,
and adeos does this quite well. Philippe can correct me if I'm wrong,
but with just the above hooks, much of adeos can be made to be a loadable
module.
Sure, tapping into the interrupt flow isn't as featured as having true
hard-rt in user-space (either with rt-preempt or rtai), but it's a got
a very nice cost/benefit ratio.

You are certainly entitled to your preferences, but if you're interested
in hearing about large-scale/industrial deployments of RTAI (and there
are plenty I assure you), I would suggest a visit to the rtai-users mailing
list.
