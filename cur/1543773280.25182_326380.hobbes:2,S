Every unicode code point has exactly one UTF-8 representation, however there
are for a few glyphs multiple code points. And this is not only a problem
beause of homoglphys which look like/similiar, but also because of combining
characters vs. legacy characters. However thats more an issue of the user
interface (think IDN exploits).
Personally I think the on-disk  filesystem format should be required to be
UTF-8, and its an open discussion if the syscalls accept UTF-8 or locale
byte encodings. Currently its a mess. We can learn from Windows here:)
