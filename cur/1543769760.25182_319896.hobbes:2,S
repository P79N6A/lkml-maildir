Subject: [patch 1/1] Avoid wasting IRQs for PCI devices (i386)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I have submitted the patch for x86_64, this is submission for i386.
<--snip-->
The patch changes the way IRQs are handed out to PCI devices. Currently, each I/O APIC pin gets associated 
with an IRQ, no matter if the pin is used or not. This imposes severe limitation on systems that have designs 
that employ many  I/O APICs, only utilizing couple lines of each, such as P64H2 chipset. It is used in ES7000, 
and currently, there is no way to boot the system with more that 9 I/O APICs. The simple change below allows 
to boot a system with say 64 (or more) I/O APICs, each providing 1 slot, which otherwise impossible because of 
the IRQ gaps created for unused lines on each I/O APIC. It does not resolve the problem with number of devices 
that exceeds number of possible IRQs, but eases up a tension for IRQs on any large system with potentually large 
number of devices.
