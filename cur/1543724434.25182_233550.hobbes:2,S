The email listed in the MAINTAINERS file bounces, so the driver is not
supported so well, I'm acting as maintainer, but no one is paying me.
The sis900 driver driver works in most cases, I am aware of some issues,
mostly caused by new hardware not known by the driver. These problems,
however, cause slowdowns, but the card is always detected.
So before saying anything let's wait for the poster's dmesg.
Cheers.
