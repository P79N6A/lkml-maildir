Actually a combination -- which direction do arguments grow in relation
to stack growth direction, and do you have a stack push instruction.

No, that's only true if your target supports stack pushes.
For instance, gcc on x86/linux will evaluate arguments right-to-left,
since it hopes to push arguments to the stack in that order.  But 
gcc on sparc will evaluate arguments mostly left-to-right, even though
the arguments are stored on the stack in the same layout as x86.
And actually it's more complicated than that, since I believe that
on most RISC we'll evaluate the arguments that wind up on the stack
first, left-to-right, then the arguments that wind up in registers, 
left-to-right.

Speak ye little of "all known compilers".
It is possible to implement varargs however you like.  Up, down, or
sideways, every direction is used by some target somewhere.
