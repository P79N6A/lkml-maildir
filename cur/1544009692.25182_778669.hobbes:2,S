Hi Remy,
Thanks!  And you have caught on to our plan ;-)  This is actually why we 
have the scripts. My plan was to start introducing the new API slowly over 
time, but in the mean time, the RT tree will keep the script to convert 
all the rest that we want to the new locks. Eventually (hopefully), all 
the locks in mainline will be the same as the locks in the rt git tree. 
When that happens, we will not need these scripts anymore.
The rt git tree is a place to start testing the waters of the new API. 
With this exposure, other developers will start understanding what it is 
made for.
One thing we want in mainline before we use this is interrupts as threads. 
This will first start out as drivers having their own interrupt threads, 
and eventually we can get rid of the need for softirqs and tasklets.  Then 
we could have a option to turn all interrupts into threads as RT does. If 
we do that, then the new lock API could be used even more immediately. It 
could then be used to convert locks that are spinlocks only because they 
are shared with an interrupt. The lock_t type could be changed to a mutex 
when interrupts are threads and spinlocks otherwise.
But first we need to take it slowly. And this git tree is the first step.
