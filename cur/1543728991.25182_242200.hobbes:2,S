What claim? I'm not claiming anything, just trying to report a problem. 
I don't have the slightest idea what might be causing this problem, but 
the problem is real. I can see that the dmesg files are identical which 
is why I said they were "totally uninteresting".  Since the new kernel 
is the only variable in this situation, I thought it reasonable to 
request help from you kernel gods.  Sorry, I'll now crawl back under my 
rock.
