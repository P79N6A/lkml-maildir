oops ... as doesn't complain about that either .... the error is produced
when moving a segreg to a 32bit memory location, e.g.:
(nasm)
        mov     ds,long [ebx]
(as)
#APP
        movl %ds,636(%ebx)
        movl %gs,640(%ebx)
#NO_APP
neither nasm nor as do like that. I wonder which code the previous
binutils produced in that case?
sorry for the superfluos posting, I really should brush up on my assembly;-)
the consequence still is to apply the patches to the kernel.
best regards,
