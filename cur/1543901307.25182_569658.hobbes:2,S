From personal experience I can assure you that it hasn't been easy
getting the USB subsystem to restore devices following a hibernate.  
(In fact the current implementation goes against the spirit, if not the
letter, of the USB spec.)  And making it work requires user
intervention.
As for the VGA font, the effect is easy to see: Run setfont before 
hibernating; when you resume the original font will be back.  The 
kernel simply does not bother to save the VGA font information across a 
hibernate.

That's exactly my point.  While doing suspend-to-RAM from a kexec'd 
kernel may be simple, saving the hibernation image will add 
complications.

I said nothing about dumping onto USB flash.  I was referring to PCI 
probing; presumably any reasonable kernel for desktop/laptop systems 
will include PCI support.
And the bug isn't in Linux; it is in the firmware.  There's no way to 
fix it short of a BIOS upgrade (and this particular BIOS is no longer 
supported).
