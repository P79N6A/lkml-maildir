Recently someone complained that __sched_text_start changed address during
pass one and two of kallsyms. The actual culprint was that an
address changed due to different section layout.
The fix I posted was to align .sched.text to an 8 byte boundary.
Can we say anything about alignment of functions across architectures?
Patch in question below.
Grepping tells me to use FUNCTION_ALIGN if I push this for inclusion.
