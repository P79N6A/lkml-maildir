I didn't see Chris' patch.  I assume that the worst case is unexpected
program failure due to lack of capability, right?  The SELinux security
transitions aren't tied to the uid/capability evolution anyway, and
SELinux provides its own separation among differing security domains,
including the kernel access controls and enabling glibc secure mode.
Side bar:  Why does the uid/capability logic proceed under the old
uid/capability set rather than aborting the exec?  SELinux leaves the
task SID unchanged and forces a SIGKILL, as we don't really want the
program proceeding under the wrong permission set anyway.

Likely a good idea.

Didn't apply for me.  Also would help to rebase to 2.6.6-rc2-mm1.

Above line needs to be deleted, right?
