Yes.
Some kind of better-patch is badly needed.
What kind of data would have to be in soft-changeset?
* unique id of changeset
* unique id of previous changeset
(two previous if it is merge)
? or would it be better to have here
whole path to first change?
* commit comment
* for each file:
** diff -u of change
** file's unique id
** in case of rename: new name (delete is rename to special dir)
** in case of chmod/chown: new permissions
** per-file comment
? How to handle directory moves?
Does it seem sane? Any comments?
