Whatever that app is doing, clearly we have to keep those 4k in cache!
Like obviously the specweb demonstrated that as long as you are
_repeating_ the same read, it's correct to activate the page even if
it was reading from the same page as before.
What is wrong is to activate the page more aggressively if it's
_different_ parts of the page that are being read in a contiguous
way. I thought that the whole point of the ra.prev_page was to detect
_contiguous_ (not random) I/O made with a small buffer, anything else
doesn't make much sense to me.
In short I think taking a ra.prev_offset into account as suggested by
Dave Kleikamp is the best, it may actually benefit the obscure app too ;)
