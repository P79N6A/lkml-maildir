Yes that looks good. The 'uint32_t __pad' -> 'u32 __pad' change I will 
address in the next mail I am currently composing.
(And if I may add: I would have split that commit into three commits - one 
for each paragraph you wrote in the changelog :-)
Hm copy and paste from Firefox to xterm removes all the indenting.
opening the url with w3m already has all indent removed too. What's wrong with
the gitweb today? :-(
