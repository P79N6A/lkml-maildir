No, I'm looking for something simple.
Perhaps something like:
Makefile contents:
all: [0-9a-z]*
install:
	sh cat [0-9a-z]* > ../MAINTAINERS
clean:
	rm -f ../MAINTAINERS
I don't hardly understand the linux make machinery
for files that aren't .o, so I don't know if that's
reasonable or valid.

My preference is for a single directory with 
maintainers stored as separate files because
it's very simple, but it's still up in the air.
Basically breaking up the current monolithic
MAINTAINERS file into separate little files.
For instance this chunk of MAINTAINERS

would become
File "maintainers/3c359_network_driver" with content:
