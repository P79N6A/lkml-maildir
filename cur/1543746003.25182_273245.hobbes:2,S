Jeff,
you're using commodity x86 hardware.  what do you expect?
while the speed of PCs has increased significantly, there are still 
significant bottlenecks when it comes to PCI bandwidth, PCI arbitration 
efficiency & # of interrupts/second.
linux ain't bad -- but there are other OSes which still do slightly better 
given equivalent hardware.
with a PC comes flexibility.
that won't match the speed of the FPGAs in a Spirent Smartbits, Agilent 
RouterTester, IXIA et al ...
cheers,
lincoln.
