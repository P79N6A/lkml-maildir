It already does that. Why do you remove the unused attribute from it?
The correct thing to do is IMHO put it into .text.exit and .data.exit and
add clauses into arch vmlinux.lds that it will throw those sections away
before linking vmlinux. It is never needed, so why should kernel carry
unneeded text/data.
It was in my init.h patch I've sent last time to the list, if anyone is
interested I can dig it out and resend.
Cheers,
