Should I send a bug report to him or is he online here?
> Any details, like kernel version, oops or panic logs, etc.?
Kernel version is 2.4.20 (Redhat 9.0 + newest upgrade)
The oops and the panic logs were not written down as the major focus
was getting this (production) system up and running, sorry for that
