I agree that things are better.  But, ironically, this patch is a case
in point.  It's attached as text/x-patch and makes replying to and
commenting on patch inline more laborious.  Perhaps it should be clear,
text/plain tends to work (and is better than inline whitespace damaged
patches).  Andrew's "The Perfect Patch" has some text you could lift.
