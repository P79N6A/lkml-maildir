Thanks for the pointer.
  For non-zero order allocations, the test against __GFP_FAIL is a little
too soon; it would be better after we've tried to reclaim pages from the
inactive-clean list.  Any nasty side effects to this?
  Plus, the code still prevents PF_MEMALLOC processes from using the
inactive-clean list for non-zero order allocations.  As the trend seems to
be to make zero and non-zero allocations 'equivalent', shouldn't this
restriction to lifted?
