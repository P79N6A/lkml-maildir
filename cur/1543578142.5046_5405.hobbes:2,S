Subject: Raid code panic with kernel compiled for i486

I was testing the 2.4.0 kernel and found out that when a kernel
compiled for processors under P3 (i486, P2/Celeron) and booting it on a P3
the kernel
panics when it's tries to test different RAID5 xor algorithms.
The panic looks something like this:
...
raid5: measuring checksuming speed
8regs    : 773.430 MB/sec
32regs    :    562.356 MB/sec
invalid operand: 0000
CPU:    0
EIP:    0010:[<c0259c7d>]
...
I've tried with:
2.4.0,  gcc 2.95.2
2.4.0-ac4, gcc 2.95.2
2.4.0 SMP, gcc 2.95.2
2.4.0 UP, egcs 1.1.2
