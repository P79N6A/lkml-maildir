Hello, all:
    I compile my linux module program dony.c with "-D--Kernel__ -DMODULE"
options enabled, and then insert it into kernel using "insmod  dony.o" . It
stops when it tries to access a global varible "struct dony_struct
MyPrivateStruct" and complains such messages as "cannot handle page request
at virtual address 0xdXXXXXXX".  So I printk its address and find it is at
0xdXXXXXXX  instead of 0xcXXXXXXX.
     How can I solve it?
     Thank you very much.
    dony
