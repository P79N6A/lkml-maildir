Hi Rob and others on the list.
Thank you for your effort.
Yes it seems that my problem is that there is no 8042 controller in my
system.
But unfortunatly it is not enough to comment out the call to empty_8042.
I have to figure out another way to enable A20 gate handling than the
keyboard way.
Pherhaps somone has tried that before?
Best regards 
Gusti
