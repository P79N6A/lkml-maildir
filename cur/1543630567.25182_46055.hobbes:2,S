And here is the key why your solutions pio out was wrong in the past.
You think like a geek and not like the hardware.  But it is your^W the
masses data you continue to screw over.  Again you may be a wiz kid with a
cool OS, but you are still clueless about storage.
Maybe you should learn from your mistakes.
Try removing the HBA hotrodding of the DMA engine.
If the hardware is not designed to run at the latest standard, sane people
do not push it there.  ATA 100 takes 4 clock where ATA 133 takes three
clocks to move the same amount of data.  I hope this is a big enough clue
for you back out most of the experimental crap inserted.  Now to be even
more clear, the dropped data clock (ie data corruption lost) happens in
both directions and at the same location on the trace.  However, who cares
it is a development kernel, lets continues to trash peoples data silently!
