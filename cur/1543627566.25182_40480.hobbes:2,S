	It is used to keep information that the kernel might otherwise throw away in 
case it is needed later. It is also used to accumulate writes so that they 
can be made at a time where they can be done more efficiently.

	So you now have a ton of information. You have 512Mb of physical RAM, 450 of 
that is being used. 100Mb of that is process memory, 350Mb of that is buffers 
and cache.

	Are you arguing that you shouldn't have all the information the kernel is 
providing you? That some of it should be hidden from you and memory should be 
said to be free when it really isn't?
	All of your physical memory, less what is used by the kernel itself, is 
always available to applications. That memory is being used. Really.
	If you don't want your memory to be used, take it out of your computer. You 
paid good money for it. The kernel is using it. You should be happy.
