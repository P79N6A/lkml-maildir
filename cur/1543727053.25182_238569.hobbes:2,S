Subject: RE: [PATCH][RFC] fix ACPI IRQ routing after S3 suspend

Shaohua,
pci=noacpi and acpi=noirq are boot workarounds --
not full-featured supported configurations -- YMMV!
We don't even guarantee that the ACPI SCI
will work with these configurations.
So I think we should spend 0 effort to support ACPI suspend/resume
in configurations where ACPI is partially disabled.
Sorry if this contradicts what I said yesterday,
I think I wasn't thinking clearly then.
thanks,
-Len
