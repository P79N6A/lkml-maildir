Resources are assigned on bootup by MIPS, not yet by pci_enable_device,
so that was expected.

Odd.  I knew the resource allocation stuff has it's issues for some
non-trivial configuration but that one is a new one.  Which makes me
wonder if your platform runs the PCI code in probe-only mode where it
will not actually assign resources but only inherit the whole PCI setup
except interrupt routing from the firmware.
What MIPS platform do you use?  I'd like to take a look at its PCI setup
code.
