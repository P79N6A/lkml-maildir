Subject: where to export system tuneables, /proc/sys/kernel or /sys/?

I'm doing some kernel work that will export tuneables to userspace.  In 
2.4 I would have used /proc/sys/kernel, but now there is /sys, which was 
supposed to be for system information.
However, a bit of poking around in /sys didn't reveal any obvious place 
to put it.  Is current practice to still put this sort of thing in /proc?
Thanks,
Chris
