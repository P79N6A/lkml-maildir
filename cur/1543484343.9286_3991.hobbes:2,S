There's been no official incorporation of the patch into the kernel,
however, I did patch the required stuff into the 2.2.1 vesion of
arch/i386/kernel/head.S and my Cx486DRx2 went from 5.4 bogomips to 15.7.  Of
course, you could also use the linux util for enabling the cache in user
space, rather than patching the kernel, it works great except that your
/proc/cpuinfo will still be reported slow because it is calculated before
the cache is enabled.
The user space tool is available at
http://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/hardware/cyrix-1.00.tar.gz
To comile as ELF you also need cyrix-1.00-elf.patch available in the same
directory.  I highly suggest this method.
If you want a diff to patch this in to head.S email me directly and I'll be
glad to send it to you.
Later,
Tom
