You are missing a kernel patch.  The LABEL is a function of the filesystem
and not the partition, and the kernel doesn't check the filesystems for
labels...  One option is to just give the right device for root, another
is to add a patch (posted to l-k about 1.5 years ago) which added kernel
support for this, and a third is to add an initrd which figures out the
label in user space and uses that to mount the root fs.
Cheers, Andreas
