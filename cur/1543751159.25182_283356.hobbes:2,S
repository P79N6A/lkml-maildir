Hallo l-k,
I'm using external disc box from Spire with dual USB/IEEE1394 interface
(GigaPod CF103-NEB, 
http://www.spirecoolers.com/acc.asp?ProdID=95
).
Although I can use my IDE disc (WD600JB) OK via USB, I cannot deal with
this disc via ieee1394. I tried to debug this situation and I've
found, that via ieee1394 are data from disc moved with 16B offset
from data via USB (I can mount this disk via IDE interface, then I
suppose, that USB deal with this disc in right way, or in another words:
in the same way as IDE). I've got different size of device, too
(ieee1394 has wrong size, difference is ieee1394=USB-1 block).
I'm sending in attachment 2 files: isdb2.sec2 and usdb2.sec2
isdb2.sec2 is got via ieee1394 (and sbp2), usdb2.sec2 is via USB (and
usb-storage). Files are created throught this command:
dd if=/dev/sdb2 of=[i,u]sdb2.sec2 bs=512 count=1 skip=2
Hope that help to debug...
Sincerely
Jan Marek
