Hmm, altough I'm fully aware of these points being restricted to UID
issues, it is very reminiscent of the win16->win32 transition and all
its pain (& overhead). Esp. items 4-6 seem rather ugly to me. Was this
meant to be a temporary workaround - maybe introduced in 2.3/2.4 and
then 2.6/3.0 support only 32bit-UID - or do such things become legacy
ballast until a 'Linux NT' is written from scratch to remove all of
this?
