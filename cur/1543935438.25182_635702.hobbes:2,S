Hi,
The following experiments were conducted on a two socket dual core
intel processor based machine in order to understand the impact of
sched_mc_power_savings scheduler heuristics.
Kernel linux-2.6.24-rc6:
CONFIG_SCHED_SMT=y
CONFIG_SCHED_MC=y
CONFIG_TICK_ONESHOT=y
CONFIG_NO_HZ=y
CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS=y
CONFIG_GENERIC_CLOCKEVENTS_BUILD=y
CONFIG_HPET_TIMER=y
CONFIG_HPET_EMULATE_RTC=y
tick-sched.c has been instrumented to collect idle entry and exit time
stamps.
Instrumentation patch:
Instrument tick-sched nohz code and generate time stamp trace data.

The idle time collected are time stamp at (C) minus (B). This is the
time interval between stopping ticks and restarting ticks in an idle
system.

The scheduler heuristics for multi core system
/sys/devices/system/cpu/sched_mc_power_savings should ideally extend
the cpu tickless idle time atleast on few CPU in an SMP machine.
However in the experiment it was found that turning on
sched_mc_power_savings marginally increased the idle time in only some
of the CPUs.
Experiment 1:
-------------
Setup:
* yum-updated and irqbalance daemon was stopped to reduce the idle
  wakeup rate
* All irqs manually routed to CPU0 only (hoping this will keep other
  CPUs idle) (
http://svaidy.googlepages.com/1-irq-config.txt
)
* Powertop shows around 35 wakeups per second during idle
  (
http://svaidy.googlepages.com/1-powertop-screen.txt
)
* The trace of idle time stamps was collected for 120 seconds with the
  system in idle state
Results:
There are 4 png files that plots the idle time for each CPU in the
system.  
Please get the graphs from the following URLs
http://svaidy.googlepages.com/1-idle-cpu0.png
http://svaidy.googlepages.com/1-idle-cpu1.png
http://svaidy.googlepages.com/1-idle-cpu2.png
http://svaidy.googlepages.com/1-idle-cpu3.png
Each png file has 4 graphs plotted that is relevant to one CPU
* Right-top plot is the idle time sample obtained during the
  experiment
* Left-top graph is histogram of right top plot
* The bottom graphs corresponding to idle times when
  sched_mc_power_savings=1
Observations with sched_mc_power_savings=1:
* No major impact of sched_mc_power_savings on CPU0 and CPU1
* Significant idle time improvement on CPU2
* However, significant idle time reduction on CPU3
Experiment 2:
-------------
Setup:
* USB stopped
* Most daemons like yum-updatesd, hal, autofs, syslog, crond, irqbalance,
  sendmail, pcscd were stopped  
* Interrupt routing left to default but irqbalance daemon stopped  
* Powertop shows around 4 wakeups per second during idle
  (
http://svaidy.googlepages.com/2-powertop-screen.txt
) 
* The trace of idle time stamps was collected for 120 seconds with the
  system in idle state

The details of the plot are same as the previous experiment.
Observations with sched_mc_power_savings=1:
* No major impact of sched_mc_power_savings on CPU0 and CPU1
* Good idle time improvement on CPU2 and CPU3
Please review the experiment and comment on how the effectiveness of
sched_mc_power_savings can be analysed.  
At very very low wakeup count of ~4 per second on 4 CPU system gave
good idle time result when sched_mc_power_savings is enabled.
However the results are not as expected even at a marginal wakeup
count of ~35 per second.  
Please let us know your comments and suggestions on the experiment or
results.  
Do we have similar analysis and data on scheduler heuristics for power
savings.
Thanks,
Vaidy
