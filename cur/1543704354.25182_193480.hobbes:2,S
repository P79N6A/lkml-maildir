   In message <20040122195104.31cc2496.akpm@osdl.org> you write:

   OK.  Although I think I prefer to have down_cpucontrol() defined under
   #ifdef CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU, and revert to using a normal sem here as
   well to cover the CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU=n CONFIG_SMP=y case.  But I will
   produce an additional patch with the hotplug cpu patches.
Rusty take a look at Linus's current BK tree, it should be
to your satisfaction I think :)
