So it doesn't seem like you are losing interrupts. And
it doesn't appear to be confined to the anticpatory
scheduler - definitely nothing fundamental because setting
antic_expire = 0 still gives you problems.
The only other problems I can think of that you might be
having are chipset problems, or CPU scheduler problems.
Which reminds me, do you have your X server at nice 0?
If not, try:
renice 0 `pidof X`
and let us know how you go.
