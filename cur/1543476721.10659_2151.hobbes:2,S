I'm responsible for some of the code in that driver, so I'll field this
one.  The commercial FM band over here is defined as a range from 87.9 to
107.9 using the odd tenths values.  The 88-108 range never presented a
problem, so it stayed that way.

That patch should be fine.  I imagine other users will report similar
range issues as 2.2 spreads to other parts of the world and similar
changes will have to be applied then.
