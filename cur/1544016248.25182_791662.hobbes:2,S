I think the socket release in skb_splice_bits() (although necessary)
just muddies the waters, and whether the extra one done in
tcp_splice_read() helps at all is open to debate.
That skb_clone() done by skb_splice_bits() pisses me off too,
we really ought to fix that.  And we also have that data corruption
bug to cure too.
