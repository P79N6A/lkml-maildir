<sigh>  There is nothing in the SMTP RFCs that require any to be able to
accept all email at all times.  SMTP is *not* designed to be a reliable
delivery mechanism, let alone a first-time reliable delivery mechanism.
Refusal to accept email because the receiving system is under high load is
well understood, commonly accepted, and even codified in implementation
practice.
In my opinion, you are doing a GoodThing(tm) by trying to weed broken
addresses from the mailing list. But please don't demand from the internet
behavior it wasn't designed to provide.
