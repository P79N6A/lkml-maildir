FWIW, I have also run into this "I need I2C early in boot, but it's not
inited until late" on SiByte (arch/mips/sibyte/{sb1250,bcm1480}/setup.c).  
For the time being in the linux-mips tree we simply have two drivers
talking to the I2C interface - sibyte/swarm/rtc_* and i2c-sibyte.c,
and they are currently lacking even any trivial locking.  We haven't
seen any problems yet but that's due to limited exercise - the default
config doesn't hook up any drivers for the other chips on I2C.
How do other arches that have I2C RTCs deal with this problem?  Or is
there something wrong with how arch/mips/kernel/time.c:time_init deals
with the rtc?

I would also be overjoyed to have a GPIO infrastructure to plug into.
(And I would say "GPIOs are not used on PCs"; I am confident the Geode
driving the seat-back TV on this Song flight has GPIOs...)
