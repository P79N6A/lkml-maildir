I think, there ist still a small bug.
(This time I even checked 2.4.0-test12-pre8)
In linux/arch/i386/kernel/process.c, function kernel_thread, line 453 the
flag CLONE_VM is always used.
In sched.c, function daemonize, line 1216 you call exit_mm.
Since the memory is cloned, you  will take away the mem from your
user-space-application as well. So if insmod is already running at that
time, it has to segvault. If I am not wrong at this point CLONE_VM simply
has to be removed from kernel_thread. The kernel-thread will free his mem
in daemonize (calling exit_mm) and the user-space-application will free
the mem when exiting.
