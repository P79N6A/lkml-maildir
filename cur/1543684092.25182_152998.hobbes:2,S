Well, I just put my system under severe natural load using
2.6.0-test2-mm1 and I must say that my system remained as responsive
as one could expect. I have a PentiumIII 500Mhz with 192 Mb RAM. 
Here's what load was like:
1) Compiling 2.6.0-test2-mm1-O11.1int :)
2) updating spamassassin bayesian filters (This mainly causes heavy
   disk i/o, the CPU usage is not so high)
3) procmail filtering ~40 emails simultaneously. 
4) playing ogg's in xmms 
5) switching between viewing pdf's and web-browsing
Window switching remained pretty snappy and there was one skip in
the music . The pdf's scrolled at a decent speed too.
All in all I would say that I really cannot expect anything more in
terms of responsiveness from my hardware. IMO, there is a limit to the
magic a good scheduler can do on limited hardware resources. 
The scheduler has certainly come a long way since 2.6.0-test1
( plus all subsequent patches and versions). Great work.
