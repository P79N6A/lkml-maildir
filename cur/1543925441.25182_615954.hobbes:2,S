Last i know is that Intel doesn't provide an AHCI driver for the 
non-RAID version. (For whatever political reason). That is even 
documented in the german "c't", they even had an articel about "patching 
in the Device-IDs" so the RAID-AHCI driver accepts the non-RAID AHCI 
chipsets.
And i can second that, when i configure my @home MB (ASUS P5B = non-RAID) 
to AHCI neither XP nor Vista work.
@work i tried to install Vista on an AHCI-configured machine and aborted 
that "expriment" after about 2 hours. In IDE-mode it took Vista about 3 
Minutes to reach the point where i aborted the AHCI experiment.
So i must say: My milage varies.
