Yes, I already implemented it, but have yet to boot it.
You only need Intel and AMD prefetch. For all Athlons the SSE prefetches
work (because we force the SSE MSR bit to on). prefetchw is 3dnow.
3dnow non 'w' prefetches would only make sense on the K6, but they're
not really worth it there because it doesn't have enough oustanding loads
in the memory unit and worse prefetch is microcoded there.
