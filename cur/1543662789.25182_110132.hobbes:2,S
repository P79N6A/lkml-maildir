Hi!
I tried cpufreq on hp omnibook with athlon4 cpu... Its interesting: It
works *in addition* to ACPI throttling. That means I can slow it down
to 4% of top speed.
Documentation/cpufreq should probably be renamed to Doc*/cpufreq.txt.
Kernel says:
powernow: AMD K7 CPU detected.
powernow: PowerNOW! Technology present. Can scale: frequency and
voltage.
powernow: Found PSB header at c00f7ab0
powernow: Table version: 0x12
powernow: Flags: 0x0 (Mobile voltage regulator)
powernow: Settling Time: 100 microseconds.
powernow: Has 14 PST tables. (Only dumping ones relevant to this CPU).
powernow: PST:2 (@c00f7ae4)
powernow:  cpuid: 0x761 fsb: 100        maxFID: 0xc     startvid: 0xc
powernow:    FID: 0x10 (3.0x [300MHz])  VID: 0xc (1.400V)
powernow:    FID: 0x4 (5.0x [500MHz])   VID: 0xc (1.400V)
powernow:    FID: 0x6 (6.0x [600MHz])   VID: 0xc (1.400V)
powernow:    FID: 0x8 (7.0x [700MHz])   VID: 0xc (1.400V)
powernow:    FID: 0xc (9.0x [900MHz])   VID: 0xc (1.400V)
First it claims it can scale voltage, then I see I can only use
1.4V. Too bad for me (and my batteries ;-)...
