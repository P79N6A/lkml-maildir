just booted kernel 2.2.2 with the pre2 patch and here's what free shows
currently:
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:        128188     124524       3664     369764       3104      19752
-/+ buffers/cache:     101668      26520
Swap:        40156        856      39300
notice the ungawdly 'shared' number
top reports the same thing.
I'm runnning procps-1.2.9
am I missing something?
Thanx,
