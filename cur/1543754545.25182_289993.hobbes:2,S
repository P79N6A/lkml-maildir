hello,
I saw that there is an implementation of MSI in the Linux kernel 2.6 stream.
Is there a possibility to port this in the 2.4 kernel tree (we are at 
this time using 2.4.17) ?
Is this already foreseen and planned and when ?
Is this MSI feature already used out there ? on which target processor 
and southbridge ?
Please CC me ( mailto:philippe.marteau@alcatel.fr )since I am not

Regards
Philippe
