Its a valid file. Does ownership matter here?

Yes.

The difference is mainly that fput() does full processing whereas
put_filp() is used when we know that the file was not fully operational.
If the checks in __fput are able to handle the put_filp() situation by not
releasing resources that were not allocated then we should be fine.

Looks like it. It seems to assume that no dentry is associated.

Only if fput() can handle partially setup files.
