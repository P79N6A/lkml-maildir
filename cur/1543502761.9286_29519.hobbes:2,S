First::
Promise's FastTrak and DriveDefender are BIOS based psuedo-hardware RAID.
There is nothing different between the Promise Ultra33, DriveDefender, and
FastTrak.  The only differ in the BIOS contents.
Second::
You kill the monitor package/tool, in a native supported OS, for any of
the PDC20246/20247 based ATA-33 RAID cards.  Then delete everything but
enough of the OS to run, it will not correct the contents of the second
disk ever.  It needs a software API tool to update the mirror.
Translation::
A cute ATA-33 card with bells and whistles, that has a powerful software
raid that does a great fake of looking like hardware.  Now I will have toi
recant this because, it is possible to program it into real/active RAID
mode.
Oh well, maybe someone will try again.
