But the spam I know has been a big problem. Maybe NNTP servers with
authorisation? (People apply and get user names and passwords?). A right
royal pain in the ass, though.
Interestingly though, would gating the group to nntp at vger and using
ihave/sendme (or whatever is the 'best' inter-server protocol these days,
I'm out of date) to the exploders have any efficiency wins? Especially if
there was some way postings could go to the local exploder.. Hmm, I'm tired,
that could all be obvious nonsense. I'll shut up!
