Hello,
Glad to introduce 2.6.7-hsc0 patch set, the armnommu support for linux-2.6.7
kernel.
Which means uClinux/ARM patch against 2.6.7 in alternative. You can find the
patch at :
http://opensrc.sec.samsung.com
or directly,
http://opensrc.sec.samsung.com/download/linux-2.6.7-hsc0.patch.gz
It is generated against vanilla 2.6.7 kernel.
ChangeLog:
   a. new platform (s3c4510b,ESPD) is supported, with 4510b specialized
cache codes and ethernet driver.
       by Curt Brune [curt@acm.org] (thanks!)
   b. new platform (s3c44b0x) is supported, with 44b0x cache codes and
rtl8019.
       by Nickmit Zheng [nickmit_zheng@eastday.com] (thanks!)
   c. merged with internal 2.6.6-hsc1 patch and several fixes for 2.6.7.
Best Regards,
Hyok
P.S. : armnommu architecture directory have been used for uClinux/ARM
support, like m68knommu.
     Some people suggest merging into arm architecture, and I have a part of
the idea as my plan sent to RMK.
     If anyone has a good idea to co-operate with arm and armnommu without
maintaining trouble,
     please let me know. :-)
