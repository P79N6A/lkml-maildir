Seems that link negotiation didn't go right.

How did you manage to get this message to come out with a modular
driver?  Are there other driver options in modules.conf?
First-up you should avoid using any special negotiation and
transceiver options and just let the card work it out.

Do you expect half-duplex?

Lots of bad things there.  Remove any special options, then
re-run mii-diag and vortex-diag.  If your cables and peer
are behaving then you should see happy output indicating the
desired duplex, speed and negotiation status.
If it still doesn't work, try statically assigning the IP
address (get rid of DHCP somehow).  There were some workarounds
in later drivers for strange interactions between some hardware
combinations and some DHCP clients.
If it *still* doesn't work then it's time to sniff the connection
and try to see those arp messages.
And try different cables, different link peers.
And try another you-know-which operating system.  If that works OK
then we know the hardware's good.
