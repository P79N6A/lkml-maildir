You're right though I suspect even in the case where the copyrighted
work author and the licensing author are not the same, a judge will
listen to the licensing author if licensor and licensee disagree on a
point (the licensing author being a neutral third-party that presumably
knows what's in the licence it wrote). Though in this case license
author is nothing more than an expert witness
