Hm, I have a patch here to refactor the pv-ops interface into smaller
pieces.  It needs a respin against 32-bit, and obviously 64-bit should
be equivalent.  Its mostly a moving things around patch rather than a
big semantic change, so changing the users of the interface is fairly
straightforward.  I'll post it shortly, but if everyone agrees that its
the way we want to go, we should probably start out with it on 64-bit.
