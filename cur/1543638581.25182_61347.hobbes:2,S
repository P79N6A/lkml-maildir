Hello guys!
Just a small question, perhaps it's dump, but I am having big problems 
currently:
I want to setup a router-only host, which boots from two floppy drives
and has 3 network devices.
So far no problem, but when trying to access the ramdisk on the floppy,
the old problem exists that the floppy driver does not work with current
VFS.
Then I tried to shutdown the host via network, which fails because of apm
module cannot be included in kernel in 2.5.29.
So I just wanted to ask, whether someone is working on the floppy and apm
problem or if it is / will be solved in 2.5.31 ?
Nico
/* a bit frustrated, because the wifi card only works correct in 2.5 series,
   which let 2.5 the only choice.
   Perhaps I am gonna use 2.5.24, which was pretty stable and still had apm and
   floppy support...
