i'd suggest to try harder, unless you think the _fundamentals_ of the 
SLAB allocator are wrong. (which you are entitled to believe, but we 
also have to admit that the SLAB has been around for many years, and 
works pretty well)
most of the ugliness in slab.c comes from:
1) debugging. There's no easy solutions here, but it could be improved. 
2) bootstrapping. Bootstrapping an allocator in a generic way is hard.
   E.g. what if cache_cache gets larger than 1 page?
3) cache-footprint tricks and lockless fastpath. SLAB does things all 
   the right way, even that ugly memmove is the right thing. Maybe it 
   could be cleaned up, but the fundamental complexity will likely 
   remain.
