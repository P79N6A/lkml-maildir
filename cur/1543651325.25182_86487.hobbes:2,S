Now all you need is the users to know "make defconfig". I compile kernels since 1.2.13, but I didn't know the option till today. Sure, my fault, but I'm sure I'm not the only one.
Detail: IMHO the USB keyboard and mouse support should be on, and DRI should be enabled for all video cards, but that is a minor issue...
