Russell, 
I meant to ask this a little bit back, while I was looking through this
code.  In the 2.5 iteration you have for small_page.c your using the
next_hash and pprev_hash entries, which no longer are available in the
struct page, as far as I have looked, unless your struct page is defined
elsewhere, other than linux/mm.h?  Just wondering, as I pull apart the mm
code in what time I have looking at this.
Thanks
Bruce H.
