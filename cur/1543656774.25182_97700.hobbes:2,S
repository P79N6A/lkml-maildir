A 32-bit PCI device can decode up to 2GB of memory.  I doubt any PC
firmware is reserving the top 2GB for BAR-sizing.  Without a
reasonably small a-priori limit on the address window size of device,
this method isn't safe.

That's a poor analogy.  What you're suggesting is more like replacing
the light bulb while it's powered on.  Yes, it can be done, but people
do get burned and electrocuted that way.

Yes, I see now that the method in the PCI spec isn't really safe
either, so BAR-sizing probably shouldn't be done in generic code at
all.
