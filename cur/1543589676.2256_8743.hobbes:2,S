Will it be possible to disable this fixup in kernel setup? I think, when VIA
MVP3 people will see, that 2.4.x is slower than 2.2.19, they just stay with
2.2.19, and if I understand correctly - 2.2.19 is unsafe like 2.4.4 with that
fixup disabled. I use this chipset for about year, never had any strange
filesystem crash. People who use Linux as a server system should enable any
security fixup, but if I use Linux as a workstation - I need fast video. And I
do backups.
