It's broken anyway for runtime power management.

In the long run, it's not.

Please don't exaggerate the issue.

It's a band-aid; it is not a long-term solution.

The interface is irreparably broken. You can't fix it with an infinite
number of band aids.

Just because you personally have not seen such things does not mean they
do not exist.

User application translates e.g. -EINVAL into "State not supported."

Driver implements power state policy? Sounds like that policy would find a
much more comfortable home in userspace.
