Not true.  The link I pointed to changes the way the "ethX" names are
assigned to the device based on MAC addresses.  So that's just one way
to influence the way a device is treated by a driver.

Yes I do.  See below for more.

Ok, in looking more at the 3c59x driver's module parameters, I see your
main problem.  You are relying on module wide options to effect
different cards in a system.  And these different cards could need
different options, right?
If so, yes this is a problem as you have outlined.  Might I suggest a
driverfs entry for the device?  That way every point in the device tree
could have those options be unique for the different device?  This could
also be done like you said above, with a /proc entry (but we are moving
away from /proc entries, remember? :)
Then when /sbin/hotplug is run when your network device is brought up,
it could find the driverfs entry for your device and initialize it with
the proper options (full_duplex, hw_checksums, etc.)

In the drivers/usb directory, the following are network drivers:
	CDCEther.c
	catc.c
	kaweth.c
	pegasus.c
	usbnet.c

No, all of the information is deleted when a device is removed.  When a
device is inserted again, a structure is created again.  They do not
remember information about the device across removals.
Hope this helps,
