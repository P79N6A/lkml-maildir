We had this discussion on LKML and Alan Cox' comment on it was that a
solution like this would be acceptable, where we try and shove
everything out first and then fall back on sector-by-sector to determine
where an error occurs. This will only break if the problematic sector
keeps shifting around, but at that point the card is probably toast
anyway (if the thing keeps moving how can you bad block it?).
