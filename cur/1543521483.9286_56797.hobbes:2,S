You must pay per-installation fees for SunOS. And SunOS is long dead,
unless you are talking about Solaris.

OK, "current distribution" means 2.2.x kernel today, and was 2.0 sometime
back. It will be 2.4 in a few months time, and perhaps 2.6 in a year and a
half. You are supposed to distribute the machine and source to drivers &c
_when shipped_, I'd assume. Check the code, test it to breaking *and keep
it*. Ship that to customers, and either offer upgrades to 2.4 if needed for
some reason, or stay put.
The problems you see are exactly the problems all other driver developers
are seeing, and they aren't screaming... and it was pointed out thet the
exact same (if not worse) situation exists with your "unchanging" SunOS and
every other OS out there. Unless your SunOS _is_ SunOS, then it won't
change anymore. Obviously.

Then do as Red Hat does: They ship a 2.2 kernel plus selected patches, you
can do that indefinitely. AFAIK, there are still 1.2.13 installations out
there...

Great! Then there is money to be made there. So why don't you start
StableLinux, Inc., go for an IPO and retire to the Bahamas?
