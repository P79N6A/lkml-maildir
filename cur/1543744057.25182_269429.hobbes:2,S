i did so, 1.2463 went away, building as usual - but the oops resists :(

hm, i guess this has to wait now.

yes, i'll look for changes regarding PCI. i've started to compile the -bk
snapshots too. there i can do less wrong things. when i have the "bad" -bk
snapshot i'll use "bk" itself again to find the detailed change leading to
the oops.
i hope to get another machine with a another es1371 tomorrow and see if
the error is reproduceable.
thanks,
Christian.
PS: i've taken linux-sound and alsa-devel from CC.
