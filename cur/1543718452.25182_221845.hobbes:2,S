There is no such thing as a homenode. What you describe is more or less why
we ditched that concept.
> I fork and exec another, it chooses processor 0 since processors 1 is overloaded at that time. .. Let's say an uneven distribution is chosen for all 4 processes, with all processes mapped to processor 0. So they allocate on node 0 yet the scheduler will map these to both processors since CPU should be balanced. In this case, you will have a situation where the second processor will have to fetch memory from the other processor's memory.
Each process will allocate local to the CPU it is running on when it does the
allocate, so it's difficult to get as off-kilter as you describe (though it
is still possible).
> So a better solution would be to use numactl to set the homenodes explicitly, choosing processor 0 for 2 processes, processor 1 for the 2 other processes.
In theory, it may be. If you ever had complete control of the system, and
started no other processes whatsoever. In practice, that's very unlikely,
so unless you're running a dedicated Oracle server or something, don't muck 
with it - just let the OS sort it out ;-)
