It will take forever for Intel and AMD to get their acts together :(
AMD did well by putting the memory controller on the CPU, but Intel didn't.
Intel added "IOA/T" (async DMA memory copies), but AMD doesn't have that.
And ATI/NVIDIA stuff will likely remain across the PCI-Express bus for
quite a while.
My preference is to have ATI/NVIDIA use the same PCI-Express interface,
and differentiate in the GPU.
