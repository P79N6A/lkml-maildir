That should be fine. More important is actually scaling the entropy
count based on the timing granularity of the source. Keyboards and
mice tend to have a granularity of about 1khz so timestamps better
than milliseconds 'invent' entropy in the current code.

Looks fine, but I think we want to come up with a cleaner scheme of
having per-arch high-res timestamps. I'd hate to have that grow to
several pages of ifdefs and not have it available anywhere else.
