When I bootup with the 2.2.x kernels, I see the following message scroll
by:
CPU: AMD AMD-K6(tm) 3D processor stepping 0c
It's printing AMD twice, probably because "AMD-K6(tm) 3D processor" is the
model name (from /proc/cpuinfo). Should it be displaying the brand name
too, as it's part of the model name?
Pls CC me to replies.
Thanks,
Chris
