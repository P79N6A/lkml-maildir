[PATCH] I2C: Kill i2c_client.id (4/5)
> (4/5) Deprecate i2c_client.id.
Now that i2c_client.id has no more users in the kernel (none that I
could find at least) we could remove that struct member. I however think
that it's better to only deprecate it at the moment, in case I missed
users or any of the other patches are delayed for some reason. We could
then delete the id member definitely in a month or so.
