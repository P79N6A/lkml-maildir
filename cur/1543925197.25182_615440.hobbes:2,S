Hmm, I'm surprised it's more than a one-liner. Something like
if (cannot_migrate(task))
	continue;
But I'm certainly not the expert here. Perhaps this one-liner introduces the
"unplannable O(N) overhead" Ingo mentions in the email you referenced.

Ok, so maybe we've got implementation issues to tackle. But still: a)
preempt_disable is inherently misdocumentation (preemption is not the
real problem) and b) preemption is a bigger hammer than needed. At the
very least, we should introduce migrate_disable as an alias for
preempt_disable so we can document intent.
At any rate, in the current context, we're talking about actually
disabling preempt in a *delay loop*. Let's find a fix for that.

Heh, I'd completely forgotten about this thread and thought I was
having an original idea! Must have never seen Ingo's followup.
Ingo's complaint about it being "a per-task BKL" is interesting. I've
occassionally wondered if it makes sense to make some of these
primitives take a "documentation parameter" - a pointer to an object
that does nothing more than indicate the object of interest.
