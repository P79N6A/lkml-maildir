How do I tell Linux kernel 2.4.25 on boot-time kernel commandline to
switch my eth0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Bus  1, device   3, function  0:
    Ethernet controller: 3Com Corporation 3c900 Combo [Boomerang] (rev
0).
      IRQ 11.
      Master Capable.  Latency=32.  Min Gnt=3.Max Lat=8.
      I/O at 0xc000 [0xc03f].
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
to TP transceiver and 10/100 autonegotiation?
I looked into Documentation/00-INDEX and into kernel-parameters.txt and
found just 
"        ether=          [HW,NET] Ethernet cards parameters (irq,
                        base_io_addr, mem_start, mem_end, name.
                        (mem_start is often overloaded to mean something
                        different and driver-specific).
"
which neither doesn't answer my question neither point to any
documentation where my question could be answered.
