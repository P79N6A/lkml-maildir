vtun already provides this capability in user space.
(See 
http://vtun.sourceforge.net/
)
ppp(8) on *BSD also provides this capability in user space as well.
As memory serves PPPoE on Linux is partially implemented in userspace
as is, so a partial user space solution for PPPoUDP shouldn't be that
wretched.
