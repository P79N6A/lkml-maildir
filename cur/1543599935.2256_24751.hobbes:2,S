Subject: what is the US mirror site URL for getting ac4  patch (2.4.9 ide-floppy fix)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2001/9/1/30

if -ac4 fixes the "can't mount ls-120 diskette (with diskette in drive)" 
problem (2.4.9) error:
ide-floppy: hdc: I/O error, pc = 5a, key  5, asc = 24, ascq =  0
then I need to get this patch. I would prepare to have a ftp URL site 
(preferably in the US) that has all of the ac patches (not just the ones for 
"ide") if such a site exists.
