It talks about additional restrictions imposed on your GPL granted
rights. It seems very simple to me. Future upgrade services are a
seperate contractual matter. Your whole position is positively
ridiculous. Very large amounts of GPL code is released where you don't
get updates, ever, whatever you do. Yet you don't object to those.
