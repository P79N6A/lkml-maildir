I had that changes earlier, but dropped it to make the patch smaller. It
all started with head and tail index, which is defined as unsigned int in
structure, but in aio.c, all local variables that does temporary head and
tail calculation are unsigned long. While cleaning that, it got expanded
into nr_pages etc.  Oh well.
