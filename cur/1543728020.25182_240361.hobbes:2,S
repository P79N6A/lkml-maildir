Oh ?   Haven't you seen the read/write locks in
include/linux/spinlock.h or the lockless synchronisation
provided by include/linux/rcu.h ?

In fact, two threads trying to upgrade their read lock to a
write lock simultaneously will block EACH OTHER, FOREVER.
Sounds like an exceedingly bad idea to me ;)
