Delaying the "get next batch of readiness events" call as long as
possible 
increases the amount of event collapsing possible, which is important
because 
the network stack seems to generate lots of spurious events.  Thus I
suspect 
you don't want multiple threads all calling the "get next batch of
events"
entry point frequently.
The most effective way to use something like /dev/epoll in a
multithreaded 
program might be to have one thread call "get next batch of events",
then divvy up the events across multiple threads.  
Thus I disagree that the way /dev/epoll does it is flawed.

With queued readiness notification schemes like SIGIO and /dev/epoll,
it's safest to allow readiness notifications from the kernel
to be wrong sometimes; this happens at least in the case of accept
readiness,
and possibly other places.  Once you allow that, it's easy to handle the
condition you're worried about by generating a spurious readiness
indication when registering a fd.  That's what I do in my wrapper
library.  
Also, because /dev/epoll and friends are single-shot notifications of
*changes* in readiness, there is little reason to register interest in
this or that event, and change that interest over time; instead,
apps should simply register interest in any event they might ever
be interested in.  The number of extra events they then have to ignore
is very
small, since if you take no action on a 'read ready' event, no more
of those events will occur.
So I pretty much disagree all around :-) but I do understand where
you're
coming from.  I used to feel similarly until I figured out the
'right' way to use one-shot readiness notification systems
(sometime last week :-)
