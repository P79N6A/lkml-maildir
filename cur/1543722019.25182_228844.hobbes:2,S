I've followed the whole thread and I still think what you are trying
to do can be currently accomplished with the existing API by simply 
overriding the generic ARM implementation and providing one specific
to your platform. All the dma_* APIs take a dev structure as a
parameter, so you simply have to look at that and if it's your OHCI
device, call your specific allocator/deallocator/mapping function/etc.
Your dma_alloc_coherent() would simply ioremap() and return the
ioremap'd address as the virtual address and the OHCI-bus address 
as the DMA_ADDR. Your dma_map_single() simply bounces data between
the SRAM and system memory.  Having per-bus or per-device allocators 
as you are proposing is very possibly the correct way to go, but I don't 
think it's a simple enough change that we want to do it on 2.6.
