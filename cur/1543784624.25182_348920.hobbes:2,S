Subject: Kernels >= 2.6.13 + ldconfig on boot = system lockup (2.6.12.5 works fine)

Hello there all kernel hackers,
I'm using Slackware 10.1 + current on my box and the 2.6 kernel series has been
working fine until 2.6.13 has shown up. One thing Slackware does upon bootup is
running /sbin/ldconfig to update the shared library links. When I upgraded my
kernel to version 2.6.13, the ldconfig step locks my system - no keyboard
response, I'm not even able to log in via SSH - only a hard reset helps. Don't
know whether it's any hint, but the HDD led on my chassis' front panel is lit
permanently when ldconfig is run. When I boot the 2.6.12.5 kernel, everything
works just fine. I've also got a Toshiba laptop using Slackware 10.1 + current
too and 2.6.13 works fine! I'd support you with more information but actually I
don't quite know how to obtain them - there is nothing in the system logs. Any
hints would be greatly appreciated, if you need more details - just ask me and
I'll do what I can.
Below is my hardware configuration:
Abit BE6 mainboard
Celeron 700 (Coppermine)
64 MB RAM
IBM 12 GB HDD
S3 Savage4 32 MB

Best regards,
Michal
