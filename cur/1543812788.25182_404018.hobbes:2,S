My approach reduced the number of loops performed and number
of memory needed at the expense of doing more work in the main
loop of get_user_pages. 
This was mitigated for the common case of getting just one page by 
providing a get_one_user_page() function.
The whole problem, why we need such multiple loops is that we have
no common container object for "IO vector + additional data".
So we always do a loop working over the vector returned by 
get_user_pages() all the time. The bigger that vector, 
the bigger the impact.
Maybe sth. as simple as providing get_user_pages() with some offset_of 
and container_of hackery will work these days without the disadvantages 
my old get_user_pages() work had.
The idea is, that you'll provide a vector (like arguments to calloc) and two 
offsets: One for the page to store within the offset and one for the vma 
to store.
If the offset has a special value (e.g MAX_LONG) you don't store there at all.
But if the performance problem really is get_user_pages() itself 
(and not its callers), then my approach won't help at all.
