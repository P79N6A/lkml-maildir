Subject: [PATCH] libata: fix translation for START STOP UNIT
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Applies to 2.6.20-rc6.

libata's SCSI translation for the SCSI START STOP UNIT command with the 
START bit clear (i.e. stopping the drive) appears to be incorrect. It 
sends an ATA STANDBY command with the time period set to 0, which the 
code comment says means "now", but the ATA standard says this means 
disable the standby timer, which effectively does nothing. Change this 
to issue a STANDBY IMMEDIATE command which will actually spin the drive 
down. The SAT (SCSI/ATA Translation) standard revision 9 concurs with 
this choice.
