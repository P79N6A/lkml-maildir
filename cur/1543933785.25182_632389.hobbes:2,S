Oh, I see. TOMOYO doesn't track clone() and unshare().

TOMOYO doesn't expect that all processes have the same mount trees.
But TOMOYO expects that the mount trees won't change unless one of mount()/
umount()/pivot_root() are called.
Does a process get different mount trees by just calling clone() or unshare()?
My understanding is that clone() or unshare() disables propergation of
mount tree changes when somebody calls mount() or umount() or pivot_root().

I'll say it when I submit patches.
