(quick reply)
With PVOPS on it gives compiler warnings without that explict cast.
Without looking at the code, IIRC with non-PVOPS it is a macro directly
into asm, so it didn't matter what the cast was. But with PVOPS as a
function, it gave compiler warnings.
Take it out and try compiling it for both i386 and x86_64. One of them
gave warnings. But maybe it's not a problem now.
