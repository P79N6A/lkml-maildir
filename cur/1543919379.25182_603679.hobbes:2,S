In the first case, no because an OOM error was returned rather than an inode,
and in the second case, no because an extant non-locked inode was returned.
The inode is only returned locked by iget_locked() if it is also new - in
which case we don't return in either of the above two statements.

Take a look at what iget_failed() does (patch #3):
	void iget_failed(struct inode *inode)
	{
		make_bad_inode(inode);
		unlock_new_inode(inode);
		iput(inode);
	}
