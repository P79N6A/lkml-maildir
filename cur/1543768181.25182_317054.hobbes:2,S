I suspect you are confusing "application" with "not kernel".
There are basically three layers of software on big systems:
 1) kernel
 2) administration (system services, libraries and utilities)
 3) application
Something like a batch manager is an example in layer (2) that needs
extensive knowledge of a systems hardware, and extensive ability to
manage exactly what runs and allocates where.
Large systems very much expect to manage what threads run where. These
API's are already present - check out sched_setaffinity, mbind,
set_mempolicy, and cpusets.  The details of what hardware is where,
including memory, processor and interconnect, are also there as well, in
various /proc and /sys files.
No - we don't expect the application to know all this.  But we absolutely
require that various admin level programs know this stuff in intimate
detail, and enable the administration of large systems in a variety of
ways.
