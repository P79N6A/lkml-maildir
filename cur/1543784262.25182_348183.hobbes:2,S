This was filed against ACPICA 20050708
which had a known problem with module-level code.
The ACPI patch now contains ACPICA 20050902 which
fixes that issue, and this system needs to be
re-tested with the latest patch.

The submitter confirmed that suspend to memory now works on this box.
The remaining issue on this box is related to the EC and battery,
and we're getting contradictory feedback on it.
Frankly, I think we need broader testing, and
pushing the latest ec code into 2.6.14 now is the best
way to get that.  If it turns out to be a mistake
we can always turn back time and revert
drivers/acpi/ec.c to the one that shipped in 2.6.12 --
but the one in the latest patch has proven to be
superior to 2.6.13 on other systems.

Re: 2.6.13 regressions vs 2.6.12, I'm aware of these:
  
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5165
  smp c-states on Pentium 4 with hyperthreading causes big slow-down
  
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5171
  2.6.13 SMP kernel crash on boot at pm_idle_save()
I saw lots of transient battery issues from 2.6.13-rc3
until 2.6.13-rc6, but the ones I followed went away
as of 2.6.13 final.  Do you have your eye on others
besides 4980?
thanks,
