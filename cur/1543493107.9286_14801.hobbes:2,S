There is no single answer.  A very rough first approximation that works well
in many settings is 1.5 * memory size --- but the "best" value depends on
what you're doing with the system and what kind of load it gets.  A dedicated
NFS server, for instance, doesn't need much (if any) swap, whereas a database 
server with many users can need quite a bit of swap unless the database fits
completely in memory.

     We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
