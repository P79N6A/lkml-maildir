I'm not sure we can remove much from invalidate_inode_pages2_range(). 
After lock_page() returns the page can be under writeback, so the
wait_on_page_writeback() is appropriate.  After the page has been unmapped
from pagetables it could have been be redirtied.
Perhaps the while() loop is no longer necessary - nobody else will be
mapping this locked page into pagetables.

I guess we need to repair Nick's broken wing.

I'm hoping all that stuff can go away.  Instead, change do_page_fault to
declare a new `struct page_fault_args' thing and pass that all the way up
and down the pagefault path.  Then, ->nopage implementations can simply set
page_fault_args.i_locked_the_page, to be examined at higher levels.
page_fault_args can also be used to tell do_no_page() to rerun the fault,
which would be needed if we want to stop holding down_read(mmap_sem) while
doing synchronous disk reads.
It'd be a fairly big-but-simple patch though.
