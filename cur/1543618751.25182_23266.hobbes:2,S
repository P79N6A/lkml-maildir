Subject: [patch] [sched] set_cpus_allowed() fix, 2.5.3-pre5
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/1/25/255

the attached patch fixes set_cpus_allowed() to set p->state *before*
sending the migration IPI. This is a rare codepath used during bootup
only, so the race was never seen in action. The bug was noticed by Robert
Love.
