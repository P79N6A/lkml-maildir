And what problem would this solve, besides a slight aesthetical discomfort
some may perceive ? procfs exports a fairly generic VFS interface, so it's
easy to attach subtrees with whatever semantics you like. Gluing /proc
together from various components, possibly with their own sets of support
functions, just seems like a good way to waste resources and to
de-stabilize the name space (top --pids-are-here=/kernel/pids \
  --uptime-is-here=/kernel/misc --meminfo-is-here=/kernel/vm ? ;-)
