sorry, i left out the operative word "relevant".  i dont care what random 
shell fails unless people are actually utilizing it as their /bin/sh in any 
sort of useful context.  as soon as someone complains for real and not just 
to be annoying, i'll address their complaint then.
the issue that spawned this thread has been fixed in latest dash git tree, but 
no new release has been cut.  Debian has grabbed said fixes, so go bug Ubuntu 
if they havent as well.
