We can define it to be so :-)

This is only for /proc/PID/cmdline.  You only need 1 argument, though it
is a convenient bonus that if you change argv[0] without clearing
argv[1], you'll change the name of the program while keeping the
existing arguments.

I've always expected ps to show the environment that was passed to the
program, not the current environment in the program.  You make a good
point though.  /proc/PID/environ will not show either, because it reads
from the program's environ string area which is like to be changed in a
not very predictable manner by putenv.

Ok.  So the syscall part of your patch is redundent then :-)
btw, I can see now why you need some way for the change to envp by
putenv to be passed to the kernel.  Otherwise /proc/PID/environ is
always wrong: it doesn't show the current environment and it doesn't
show the unmodified one either.  It potentially shows rubbish.
