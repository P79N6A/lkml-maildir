Lee, et all,
   Yes, I understood ivtv wasn't part of the kernel, and I did
consider trying something newer, but that meant testing that this new
ivtv didn't cause other problems which I didn't have time for as I'm
leaving tomorrow morning for home. Testing ivtv within MythTV is a
long involved process (literally hours and hours really) and I didn't
want to leave my folks without their beloved TV recording system if
something went wrong. I'll test the new kernel on my machines at home,
including with ivtv, and then I'll update them when I know it works
for me.
   None the less, and maybe as a non-developer I'm seeing this wrong,
but when a new kernel causes some drive to say a symbol isn't
available, as a user type I have no way of knowing if the symbol was
dropped on purpose or something got left out.
   I'm glad it's considered a non-issue.
Best regards and Happy upcoming New Years,
Mark
