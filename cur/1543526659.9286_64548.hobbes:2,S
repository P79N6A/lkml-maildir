Tried and it still does not work. I.e. it boots but at the attempt to
mount a SCSI cdrom it hangs - I can't even press Alt-SySrq-P.
If you would like detailed information I will, of course, provide it and
start digging deeper - I did not do it so far because I thought whoever 
converted aic7xxx to new "Documentation/DMA-mapping.txt" style just made
a simple mistake. However, if it is a real problem, I better read that
.txt file first before I try to debug it...
Regards,
Tigran.
