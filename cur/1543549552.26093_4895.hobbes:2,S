I'm running 2.4.0-test9-pre6 with my es1371 sound working just fine. Here is a
snippet from messages:
kernel: <6>es1371: version v0.26 time 08:02:58 Sep 23 2000
kernel: <6>es1371: found chip, vendor id 0x1274 device id 0x1371 revision 0x06
kernel: <6>es1371: found es1371 rev 6 at io 0x1080 irq 11
kernel: <6>es1371: features: joystick 0x0
sound: Loading sound module (es1371) succeeded 
I also first ran the system with support for es1371 compiled in, and that 
worked fine too.  This is running on sparkling new Linux-Mandrake 7.2 beta 3 
distro.  One possible glitch with the sound; the mixer on my system was 
defaulted to zero volume at first, so you obviously have to crank that up to 
hear anything.  Good luck to all.
