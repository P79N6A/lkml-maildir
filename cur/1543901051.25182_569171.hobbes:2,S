Good, at least we're on the same plane here :-)

Well, I don't really buy the uniformity/confusion argument either:
fput() will oops on NULL file *
put_super() will oops on NULL super_block *
put_task_struct() will oops on NULL task_struct *
mmput() will oops on NULL mm_struct *
configfs_put() will oops on NULL configfs_dirent *
kref_put() will oops on NULL kref * (and this one better do)
dev_put() will oops on NULL net_device *
put_driver() will oops on NULL device_driver *
and sysfs_put() also oopsed on NULL sysfs_dirent *,
till you changed it not to, that is :-)
[ and there are other examples, of course ]
I think put()'s *must* oops on NULL arguments -- it's simply a matter
of writing a good, strict, (I could add "tasteful" but that would make it
subjective) API that will *prevent* mysterious bugs.
Of course, dput(), kobject_put() and put_device() are a few counter
examples that allowing put-ing NULL objects, but it's not as if this
_disease_ has become widespread enough throughout the kernel --
that is, till we _make_ it widespread by following the lead of *mistakes*.
[ Perhaps you don't really care for the examples I mentioned above
because sysfs is "closer" in some sense to kobjects / devices and
so because those allow put-ing NULL objects, you want to make
sysfs "uniform" to them in that sense ... but that's a bad excuse. ]

Well, what I'm asking here is not to change the mistakes already
made (it's probably too late for that), but to avoid *repeating* them.

kfree(NULL) is not exactly analogous. And obviously I don't intend
changing that and then trying to change the 6,732,893 or so callsites
that assume the same :-) But what if everybody starts taking this lead
and starts {re}writing APIs accordingly throughout the kernel ...
*shudder to think*
Anyway, we've wasted enough time and bandwidth discussing this
(relatively trivial) matter, and I know nobody's mind is changed after
the end of it all (at least mine won't), so I suggest let's stop. The
proposed change is in Greg's tree already, and if he's fine with it,
then there's not much to do about it, is there :-)
