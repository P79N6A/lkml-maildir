I do not doubt that. 
But hardwiring an instrumentation framework on it is also hardwiring
implicit restrictions on the usability of the instrumentation for
certain purposes.

The do {} while loops are in the fast ltt_log_event path

I have read it and tried it. I don't see a point why I can't map a
ringbuffer into user space.

I gave constructive criticism along with points, where I just point on
the restrictions and weakness of the implementation.
