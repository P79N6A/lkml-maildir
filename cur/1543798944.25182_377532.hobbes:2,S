Is there any particular reason why you are using hdparm with '-d' and '-X'?
Your IDE host driver (pdc202xx_new in this case) should configure
best xfer mode and enable DMA so you shouldn't need to use hdparm.
Given that IDE driver code for changing xfer mode and DMA setting
is racy and actually quite hard to fix, it will probably be removed in
the future (after auditing IDE host drivers).
BTW please use linux-ide@vger.kernel.org for IDE problems
Thanks,
