The API is the parameters to modprobe or sysfs.

On as in turned on for build in the kernel config and shipped. But I
expect people will eventually actually ship it _on_ with a group
called 'rt' and possibly even put the primary user in there on install
unless you start slapping some big fat warnings on it. (I just noticed
the new Debian installer is putting the primary user in audio, cdrom,
video, etc.)
