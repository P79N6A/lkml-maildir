HI
Few days ago I noticed problem with cd-rom control:
I put cd-rom damaged disc into cd-rom drive and I want to run it.
cd-rom (tried to start cd but he couldn't do this) and aplication 
stoped 
doing anything (not responding).
OK. I thought: umount the cd (I saw: device is busy)
OK. I thought: kill process (proces wasn't killed - I tried many time)
OK. I thought: I give up, I do shutdown (shutdown was hung on unmounting 
file system).
How can I fight with this (if it's possible).
I know: under windows I can take out cd - brutal force, but under 
linux I can't.
Some my frends have the same problem with floppy drive.
PS. Sorry for my poor english.
TolekB.
