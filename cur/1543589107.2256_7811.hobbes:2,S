I'll grab virgin pre7 in a few.

Prevent cache collapse at all cost is #one.  Matching deactivation rate
to launder/reclaim.. et al.  Trying HARD to give PG_referenced a chance
to happen between aging scans [1].

1. pagecache is becoming swapcache and must be aged before anything is
done.  Meanwhile we're calling refill_inactive_scan() so fast that noone
has a chance to touch a page.   Age becomes a simple counter.. I think.
When you hit a big surge, swap pages are at the back of all lists, so all
of your valuable cache gets reclaimed before we write even one swap page.
