Would this be a practical (ie: cheap 'n not-too-difficult) project:
Build a device (with driver, of course) with a numeric keypad that plugs
into a serial/parallel/game/PS2/whatever port.  You could configure the
keys to send whatever "real" key combination a normal keyboard could do.
Ie: '1' is SysReq-s (sync), '2' is SysReq-u, '3' is SysReq-b (or, as a
alternative to Ctrl-Alt-Delete, press 1-2-3 to reboot)
Since I don't know how to do what I'm suggesting, I'm probably not
explaining it very well, but it's a start.  :-)
