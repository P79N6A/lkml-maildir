Originally I looked at that code but the comment scared me off.
synchronize_sched() maps to synchronize_rcu() and the comment says that
this only protects against rcu_read_lock(), not against preempt_disable().
/**
 * synchronize_sched - block until all CPUs have exited any non-preemptive
 * kernel code sequences.
 *
 * This means that all preempt_disable code sequences, including NMI and
 * hardware-interrupt handlers, in progress on entry will have completed
 * before this primitive returns.  However, this does not guarantee that
 * softirq handlers will have completed, since in some kernels
 *
 * This primitive provides the guarantees made by the (deprecated)
 * synchronize_kernel() API.  In contrast, synchronize_rcu() only
 * guarantees that rcu_read_lock() sections will have completed.

#define synchronize_sched() synchronize_rcu()
