Personally I can't see that you have any other option. The way the
checksum is calculated information is lost, so it's impossible to
determine exactely what input generated the current output (the checksum).
Just as it is impossible to tell if the number 6 was generated from 2+2+2,
from 3*2 or from 3+3 or some other...  So I don't see what else you can do
except just recalculate the checksum from scratch. To try and determine
how your modification would affect the checksum would probably take far
longer than just re-calculating it.
