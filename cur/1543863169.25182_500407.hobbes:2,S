I just tried once more on 2.6.20-rc5 with
boot ... init=/bin/sh
mount -t sysfs sysfs /sys
echo mem > /proc/power/state
this hung dead on resume - not a single message (kernel was compiled with 
PM_DEBUG). 
I usually do not get any messages at all. I believe it was two times I got 
anything; one is quoted in bug report and second here.
