I suggested something similar a while back but I realized it had
conceptual problems. Presumably your user-mode kernel would want to run
binaries for the same arch it was built for, and have a way to reroute
syscalls to the pseudo-kernel rather than the real kernel. That in itself
is pretty ugly. Worse yet, I see no obvious way for this 'user-mode'
kernel to do the necessary memory remapping it would need for its
processes. Being run inside of the same real process, they would have the
same view on memory.
