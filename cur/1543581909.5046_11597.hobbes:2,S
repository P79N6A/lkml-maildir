Pardon me, but IPX in 802.3 and IPX in DIX are exactly same frames
on wire, except that IPX/802.3 contains frame length in bytes
0x0C/0x0D, while IPX/DIX contains 0x8137 here. They have same length,
and same length of media header, so I really do not understand.
If you are talking about encapsulation which is known as `ethernet_802.2' 
in IPX world, then it is true, it has odd bytes in header. But nobody sane 
except Appletalk uses 802.2 now... Our Suns already died due to this couple 
of years ago ;-)
And as Ethernet SNAP has 8byte long header, it should be safe too, unless
architecture requires 16byte alignment - so only odd 802.2 should
be baned.
