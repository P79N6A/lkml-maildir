For socket ioctls the sock_ioctl code is called - net/socket.c and that
calls the protocol specific handler for the socket (eg 
inet_ioctl in net/ipv4/af_inet.c) which then calls dev_ioctl.

The wanrouter has a /proc directory it puts physical devices in, which you
can then open and ioctl on to create logical channels. Thats a fairly clean
example of driving /proc
