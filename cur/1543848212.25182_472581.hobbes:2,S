In really_probe(), it is called after ->probe has been called (though
the code does nothing but complain in the failure case).

Maybe ignoring all probe errors would be best here? (Calling
device_bind_driver() only on success, of course.)

Currently, it is the device driver which specifies whether multithreaded
probe should be done. Maybe this should rather be specified per
subsystem? Having several bus_for_each_drv(..., dev, __device_attach)
run in parallel makes more sense to me than the current approach.

There's already been a fix:

Or that. I'm currently a bit in favour of ignoring symlink errors.

?? Did you mean really_probe() here?

This would be the only sensible approach if we had one probing thread
per device. And device_bind_driver() should probably always succeed.
