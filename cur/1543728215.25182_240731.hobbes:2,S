Correct. But at the same time I miss some functionality to
tell me what a given symbol:
1) depends on
2) selects
It would be nice in menuconfig to see what config symbol
that has dependencies and/or side effects. 
[*] PCI support
Could look like:
[*]d PCI support
The space for the 'd' tag could be misused for other purposes later.
The pressing 'd' would give me the following output:
C "The C prompt"
-> depends on
   CONFIG_Z "Prompt for Z"
   -> depends on
      CONFIG_Y "Prompt for Y"
-> Selects
   CONFIG_A "Promtp for A"
   -> depends on
      CONFIG_B "Prompt for B"
Or something similar.
The idea is to give user an idea of dependencies (both ways) - recursive.
Using both CONFIG symbol and prompt will give the user an idea where to
locate it.
Something like this is on my wish list.
