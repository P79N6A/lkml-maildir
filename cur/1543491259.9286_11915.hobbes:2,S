  Hi, all. Version 96 of my devfs patch is now available from:

The devfs FAQ is also available here.
This is against 2.2.5-pre2. Highlights of this release:

- Fixed bugs: compatibility entries were not unregistered for:
    loop driver
    floppy driver
    RAMDISC driver
    IDE tape driver

    SCSI HDD driver
				Regards,
					Richard....
