Actually there is...  You don't do the copy until an actual write occurs.
Some files are opened read/write when there is simply the chance they might
be written to so delaying the copy is generally a win.
A coworker of mine implemented a version of this idea as a filesystem.
It did the copy in the kernel, it handled directories, and could be
used to atomically snapshot your filesystem.  The only case that was
still a little sketchy was how do you handle cow to a file with hard
links. 
The interesting case for us is when you have multiple machines sharing
the same root filesystem.
