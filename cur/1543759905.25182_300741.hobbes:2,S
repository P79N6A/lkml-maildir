rlimits are typically handled per user or per group.  this is set during
login and the limits apply to the users session.  none of the solutions
limit which programs the user can run, however strictly group based priv
granting can reduce the number of processes with the privs (using setgid
programs).

typically this is handled via pam during login, so yes, root (or more
specifically CAP_SYS_RESOURCE) is required, but need not be in any
wrapper.  limiting the allowed programs a user/role/domain/context/etc
can run is the goal of other type of security restrictions (such as
SELinux).

This has one advantage over RT LSM in that area, which is it places an
upper bound on the priority (in control of the admin).  So it's possible
to save some space for damage control in the top few prio slots.
