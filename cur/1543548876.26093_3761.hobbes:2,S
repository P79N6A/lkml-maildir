   Would it perhaps make sense to use one of these last 'free' fields
   as a pointer to an 'inode entension'?
   If you still want ext2fs to be able to accommodate new projects and
   ideas, then it seems that being able to extend the inode is a
   desirable feature, but perhaps this overlaps with the apparent plans
   for adding resource forks?
For stuff that's not commonly used, perhaps.  The problem is that you
take a speed hit when you have to seek somewhere else to get at the
inode extension.   So for something which is going to have to be
referenced for every stat() or getattr() operation, there are a real
performance issues with doing something like that.
