Thanks, nice to hear.
So it needs to be something stupid on my side or xfs with the new VM.
By the way. It is an Atlon 1.1 (kernel compiled with Atlon optimisation)
IDE controller ATA66, disk IBM 15 GB ATA33
The machine is solid with and without VIA pci bit 7 byte 55 zero/one
swapspace 256MB
preempable patch does not help with my D state problem
i have not tried 2.4.10.aa1
but i will try with ext2 instead of xfs next time
