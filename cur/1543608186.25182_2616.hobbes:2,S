Subject: Missing symbols with CONFIG_HIGHMEM

I just upgraded my system to 1GB of RAM and in doing so, compiled my
kernel with CONFIG_HIGHMEM and CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G.  However, the following
modules now all report the same unresolved symbols:
loop.o
minix.o
smbfs.o
umsdos.o
	The missing symbols are:
kunmap_high
highmem_start_page
kmap_high
	I'm using linux-2.4.13-ac5.
	Let me know if you need more info.  Please CC me as I'm not on the
list.
	Thanks,
	Chris
