Hi,
Because I set up a diskless Linux-workstation, I want to swap over NFS.
For this purpose I found only patches for "older" Linux-versions (2.0, 2.1,
2.2?).
Does anyone know wheter there are patches for 2.4 or does anyone know
another solution for this problem?
Because of special hardware I can only use the latest Linux 2.3 (2.3.99*) and
Linux 2.4
Thank you,
Andreas Osterburg
