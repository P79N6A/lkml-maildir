Just prevent that with spin_lock_irq.  But anyway this example doesn't
fit the ltt code.  cmpxchg loops can make lots of sense for such simple
loops, but as soon as you need to do significant work in the loop it
starts to get problematic.  Your example would btw be better off using
atomic_t and it's primitives so you abstract away the actual implementation
and the architecture can chose the most efficient implementation.
