People don't seem to notice minor speed limiting errors, and its a pretty
obscure controller too. Not suprised (it took ages for them to notice the
CMD64x one too).
It has however been tested and works pretty well for most cases. There's
one platform where you have to hack both drivers to make them work which
I need to investigate further.
