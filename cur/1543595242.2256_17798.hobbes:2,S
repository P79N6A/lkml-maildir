Hello All!
Some tests that I have recently check out.
kernel compiled with 3.0 (2.4.5) function call: 1000000 iteration. 3% slower
than 2.95.
test example - hash table add/remove - 4% slower (compiled both
with -O2 -march=i686).
Why have this version been released?
Best regards,
Alexander         mailto:dmor@7ka.mipt.ru
