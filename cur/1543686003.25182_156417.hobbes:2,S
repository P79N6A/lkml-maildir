well, although i see also a big win by this step, too, i understand
also a same "fear" for getting the system too free for all users.
at least, the current situation is that there is no user/task
restriction at all.  so, if you set up 50% soft-RR, you'll always have
a danger that anon user takes 50% all the time.
i think it would be nice if we have additionally some user/task-base
restrictions, too.
perhaps it's a job of some wrapper library.  suppose a library which
works like utempter library: checking the calling process
path whether it's a registered one, and gives the RT and mlock
capabilities to the caller in return.  these capabilities are dropped
after executing the syscalls in the wrapper lib.
this requires CAP_SETPCAP capability and one suid-root exec binary...

ok, there are mainly two directions for audio apps.
1. player programs like xmms
2. real-time audio systems (and apps) like JACK.
so, what we'll gain by soft-RR?
in the first case, which most of us are facinig, we can have the
higher priority for the audio thread with soft-RR quite easily and
more safely.  the audio-thread needs usually woken up every 0.1 or 0.2
seconds fairly precisely.  this is a main reason of drop out in
playing mp3's.  other threads (main control, decoding, graphic, etc.)
are not necessarily scheduled with a higher priority at all.
in the second case, the higher RT-priority is a "must".  since the
whole process-chain is supposed to run in a low latency, they should
be scheduled in RT.
IMO, in this area, the soft-RR is a best choice.  it prevents a
lock-up even if one of the RT-scheduled processes gets crazy.  it
guarantees the rock-stable system as an audio workstation.
as said, i think the permission is another question.  there can be
better solutions.
but even without the (default) permission to normal users, the soft-RR
scheduler is surely a great help for RT apps.
