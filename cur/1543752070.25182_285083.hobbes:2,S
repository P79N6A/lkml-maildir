Hi,
I guess it the idea was not fully and well explained. It is not the OOM Killer
itself that was moved to user space but rather its ranking algorithm.
Ranking is not an specific functionality of kernel space. Kernel only need
to know which process whould be killed.
In that sense the approach is different and might be worth testing, mainly for
cases where we want to allow better policies of ranking. For example, an
embedded device with few resources and important different running applications:
whic one is the best? To my understanding the current ranking policy
does not necessarily chooses the best one to be killed.
