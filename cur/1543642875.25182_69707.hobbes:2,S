I've also been mucking about with the DAC960 driver.  
We've got several DAC960 devices in our lab, of
two different versions, I believe.
I've fixed a few minor typos in the version that's in
the kernel.org source.  For example, the way the
code references the controller lock doesn't quite work.
The driver uses that lock before the request queue for the
controller has been allocated.  So, the controller locking
functions can't reference that lock through the request queue.
I've changed it to reference the lock through the controller
structure directly.
I've been working on the DMA mapping changes.   I've been
doing a pretty straight-forward set of changes.  As a second
pass, I'm thinking there might be some better ways to manage
the DMA mappings.
I'll post some initial changes at the endof the week, and perhaps
you can give it some review?
