Hi,
That patch is wrong for earlier kernel. There will be a memory leak on
page tables.
The reason is syscall page was not backup by VMA, clear_page_tables will
only clear up to TASK_SIZE, so there will be a leak on syscall page.
But in 2.6.11 kernel, clear_page_range will clear more page tables than
that.
I have tested my patch on 2.6.11 kernel.
Do a chroot bash to 32 bit system, then a 32 bit ltp test. No issue was
found.
However I found the patch is not compatible with recent 2.6.12-rc3
kernel.
In rc3 kernel, syscall page is backup with VMA, thus the special case
code to deal with syscall page was removed from arch/x86_64/mm/fault.c.
So I changed the patch to rebase it on 2.6.12-rc3, 
This patch has been tested on 2.6.12-rc3
by chroot to a 32 bit system, 
then follow an 32 bit ltp test.
