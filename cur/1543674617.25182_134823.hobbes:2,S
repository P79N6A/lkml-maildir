Asking just because there was another user hitting this deadlock: it seems 
with linux-irda we have a very good test case for reproducing this issue.
So I'd be happy to go testing patches if this might help.
I've also looked into the code to see if I could do something myself. 
Well, personally I do also think the best way would be to modify the 
kernel hotplug part so we can call it asynch under rtnl-lock. 
Unfortunately, given the fact there are already several layers 
(schedule_work, 2 times kernel_thread and execve) stacked on top of each 
other, I'm pretty much lost how to fix it without breaking other stuff.
I was also thinking about making net_run_sbin_hotplug asynch itself, but 
I'm unsure how this might interact with call_usermodehelper(), namely
wrt. the wait=0 parameter.
I assume we all agree this issue isn't easy to resolve. May I suggest 
adding it to the must-fix-before-2.6 list so it wouldn't get lost?
As people tend to run with CONFIG_HOTPLUG=y there would be a lot of 
trouble with 2.6 otherwise.
Thanks.
Martin
