Is there any particular reason why pte_alloc_kernel() has to have
'struct mm_struct*' as its first parameter? Except for a case in parisc
(where NULL gets passed) and another (ill-looking one) in arm26 it is
always &init_mm, and since the function is not inline the compiler can't
eliminate the needless passing of the argument.
Thanks, Jan
