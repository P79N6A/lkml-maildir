Greetings,
	I've been having a problem while using initrd with LILO.  What I'm trying
to do is boot to the initrd image.  The documentation in
linux/Documentation/initrd.txt reads: 
	...
root=/dev/ram
	initrd is mounted as root, and /linuxrc is started.  If no /linuxrc
exists, the normal boot procedure is followed, with the RAM disk still
mounted as root.  This option is mainly useful when booting from a floppy
disk.
	...
Now I've tried this with a /linuxrc.  It runs linuxrc, exits, and continues
identically to this scenario w/o a /linuxrc file.  I get:
RAMDISK: Compressed image found at block 0
VFS: Mounted root (ext2 filesystem).
(linuxrc is executed here if it exists)
[MS-DOS yada yada]
[stuff]
Transaction block size = 512
Kernel panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on 01:01
Now that kernel panic... Shouldn't it just leave the (initrd) ramdisk there
(according to the aforementioned documentation)?  Currently the kernel
ramdisk location is 0 and LILO is passing load_ramdisk=0.  I suppose a last
resort would be to give the kernel the location of the initrd file (like
LILO does w/ kernels), but I'd rather not.  I'm guessing that I'm just
missing something simple and important here.
I should also add that the filesystem is definitely legitimate.  If I don't
use LILO and directly tell the kernel where the image is, it works great. 
I definitely need LILO here though.
Also note, this behavior is identical on 2.0(.30) and 2.2.
TIA,
geisel
