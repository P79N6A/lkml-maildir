Yes, but the point is _dependant reads_. This is why Andrea's approach
alone can't solve dependant read vs write or nondependant read - while
maintaining a good throughput.

No, anticipatory scheduling just "pauses for a bit after some reads"
I am talking about all this nonsense about trying to measure seek vs
throughput vs rotational latency, etc. We don't process schedule by
how many memory accesses a process makes * processor speed / memory
speed + instruction jumps.....
If you want a fair disk scheduler, just give each process a disk
timeslice, and all your seek, stream, settle, track buffer, etc
accounting is magically done for you... For any device, and is
100% tunable. The point is, account by _time_.
