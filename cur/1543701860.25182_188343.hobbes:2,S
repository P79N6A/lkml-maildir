Hi,
it looks like ISDN4L with the hisax driver does not work anymore
in kernel 2.6.0. On my machine, the driver gets loaded, prints a
couple of messages to the syslog (none of them look like errors)
and then unloads again without any apparent reason:
...: ISDN subsystem initialized
...: HiSax: Linux Driver for passive ISDN cards
...: HiSax: Version 3.5 (module)
     ...
...: HiSax: Total 1 card defined
...: get_drv 0: 0 -> 1
...: teles0: State ST_DRV_NULL Event EV_DRV_REGISTER
...: teles0: ChangeState ST_DRV_LOADED
...: HiSax: Card 1 Protocol EDSS1 Id=teles0 (0)
...: HiSax: Traverse Tech. NETjet-S driver Rev. 2.7.6.6
...: PCI: Found IRQ 10 for device 0000:02:0c.0
...: PCI: Sharing IRQ 10 with 0000:02:05.0
...: NETjet-S: PCI card configured at 0xa800 IRQ 10
...: HiSax: ISAC version (0): 2086/2186 V1.1
...: get_drv 0: 1 -> 2
...: teles0: State ST_DRV_LOADED Event EV_STAT_UNLOAD
...: put_drv 0: 2 -> 1
...: put_drv 0: 1 -> 0
...: HiSax: Card type 20 not installed !
With kernel 2.4.x everything works without any problems.
Any Ideas?
Regards,
