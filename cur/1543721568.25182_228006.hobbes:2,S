It's permanent until someone takes the time and trouble to fix it.
Both Moxa serial drivers (moxa & mxser) are BROKEN_ON_SMP because
they use cli() to disable interrupts for critical sections.
See Documentation/cli-sti-removal.txt for details.
They will need some acceptable modern form of protection there,
Is anyone working on this?  not that I've heard of.
Have you tried this email address:
Copyright (C) 1999-2000  Moxa Technologies (support@moxa.com.tw).
Is anyone out there motivated to fix this?  This is Bruce's real
question, I believe.
