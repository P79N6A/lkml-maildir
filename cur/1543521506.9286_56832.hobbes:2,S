Seems to me the ideal fix is to add 64-bit time, but keep the 32-bit
interface for compatibility reasons.  When 2038 comes the compatibility
interface breaks, while most people hopefully use the 64-bit interface
by then.
People may start fixing libs and apps as soon as the kernel interface is
there,
it is hard to start earlier.  This is a good reason to do it early.
Using 64-bit values on a 32-bit machine is of course a bit slower, but
that's merely a reason for upgrading.
