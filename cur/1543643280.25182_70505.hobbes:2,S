Subject: -ac patch:  Which release notes?

The ac series of patches adds a config question "Have you read the
release notes?" in the IDE/ATA section.  I have read linux/README,
which identifies itself as the release notes, but found no reason for
the the warning there.
Two things:
	1)	Is there something specific I should know?
	2)	Would a patch that adds the results of question 1
		to Documentation/Configure.help be acceptable.
