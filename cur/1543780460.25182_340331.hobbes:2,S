IMHO not, no. The PL-2303 interrupt IN endpoint has a 10 bytes FIFO and
(as far as I've observed from the type_1 model) always sends packets
with exactly this size. The UART_STATE is located at offset 0x08,
therefore the minimum packet length we need is 0x09 (UART_STATE + 1).
Here are the two different byte sequences from that endpoint I picked
up; the first with a terminal on the serial end, the second without one
(both times using the patched pl2303 module with debug=1):
a1 20 00 00 00 00 02 00 00 00
a1 20 00 00 00 00 02 00 82 00
Note the UART_STATE byte with the DSR and CTS bits set in the second
case.

In the unlikely case that some weird hardware sends a packet with
exactly UART_STATE (8) bytes length, yes, we do. Normal PL-2303 hardware
_should_ cause no trouble, as it always sends 10 bytes (at least my
hardware does), therefore my side note "this keeps it on the safe side".
