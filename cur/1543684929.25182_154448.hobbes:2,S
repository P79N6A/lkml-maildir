A bug in BadRAM or the kernel proper?  There was/is a bug in the original
BadRAM patch with HighMem though it should be fixed in my patch.  It might be
worth you trying it.

Yes, it does seem to be okay.  I had unfortunatly made my system unstable by
tweaking the chipset PCI configuration space.  The tweaking was stable on 2.4.x
so I had assumed it wasn't the problem... it was!  2.6 seems to put more stress
on the system (probably due to CPU optimized memcopy's or something similar).
Thankyou for the feedback.
