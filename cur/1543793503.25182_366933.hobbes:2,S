Probably the same reason we don't have the cpufreq (for eg)
stuff under /sys/firmware.  Because it's poking hardware,
not manipulating firmware.
/sys/devices/system makes a lot more sense, as thats
where the cpu level machine check stuff is (amongst other
similar things).

Reports hardware events read from chipset specific registers.
Similar to /sys/devices/system/machinecheck/, but from
chipset instead of CPU. (That's grossly simplified, but
hopefully gets the idea across).
