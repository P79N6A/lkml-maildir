You just need to list all the possible names, as far as I know, which
isn't too bad. And udev takes care of it anyway.

To make 2.6 work with existing applications. It's scheduled to be
removed. I definitely don't want to add more workarounds for X
limitations to the kernel - that only defers fixing X.

Yes. But X really needs to start caring about hotplug. I've heard that
latest builds are moving into that direction (though I didn't try myself
yet).

The event device always exists until it's closed. It'll return -ENODEV on
any operation, but is discarded only after the last application closes
it.
What exact change of behavior do you need? If you want the kernel to
match the newly plugged-in device to the existing, open, unattached,
evdev node, well, that's near impossible to do solely in the kernel.
