Trying to modprobe saa7134 with this card results in a hanging modprobe 
process.
dmesg gets:
saa7130/34: v4l2 driver version 0.2.12 loaded
ACPI: PCI interrupt 0000:00:06.0[A] -> GSI 17 (level, low) -> IRQ 177

saa7134[0]/irq: looping -- clearing PE (parity error!) enable bit
At that point, modprobe hangs; I can still use the box in other ttys, but [of 
course] the saa7134 card doesn't work.
This is reproducable at least with with 2.6.10-rc3-mm1, 2.6.10 and 2.6.10-ac1; 
the card used to work with earlier releases (I can't remember the last 
version that worked though, haven't used it for a while).
