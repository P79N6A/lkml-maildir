Old ground - see Message-ID: <20020129144307.B6542@flint.arm.linux.org.uk>

I suspect that's because Linus gets patches to it from people he's never
heard of before (ie, the new people taking over), but without seeing
anything that says that the old maintainer has gone.
I think this is something that someone could pick up this, and be the
contact point for both maintainers leaving, and new maintainers
taking over - if you like the MAINTAINERS maintainer.  Obviously this
should be someone Linus trusts.
