The age_page mystery shallows.
It would be useful to have some rationale somewhere in the patchset for the
existence of this callback.

The "|" is obviously deliberate.  But no explanation is provided telling us
why we still call the callback if ptep_clear_flush_young() said the page
was recently referenced.  People who read your code will want to understand
this.

I just don't see how ths can be done if the callee has another thread in
the middle of establishing IO against this region of memory. 
->invalidate_page() _has_ to be able to block.  Confused.
