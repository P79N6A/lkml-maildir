No, it's not.  Yes, it probably should be.  I thought about, but
wasn't sure what other consequences that might have.  I figured my
patch would definitely fix some things, and there's actually less
overlap with setting online==possible than you might think, partly
because my patch will do the right thing if we ever have systems with
some CPUs on/offlineable and others not.
