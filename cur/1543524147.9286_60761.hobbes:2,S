Subject: [patch] 2.3.41: 4 more bytes out of the bootcode :)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

o kills one unneeded 'cld'
o kills 3 unneeded segreg prefixes
Yeah, picky. But I can be. It's asm.
I'm not sure if I used a virgin bootsect.S though, could somebody out
there test it for me? :)
This comes as a gift from AK's 360/720k bootsect patch, which as it stands
is a bit too untested for 2.3. But I'll post that next, as a separate
(read: DON'T APPLY THIS ONE ON TOP!) diff.
