That got me thinking... theoretically we should be able to do a FUSE 
server that served a single file that could be used by a loopback 
device, couldn't we?
IIRC, Miklos Szeredi tried hard to avoid the deadlock scenarios that nbd 
suffers from in FUSE, but I don't know if it would stand being called by 
the loopback device.
If it works, it should be extremely simple to do the server. Just check 
the FUSE hello world server example:
http://fuse.sourceforge.net/helloworld.html
I've CC'ed Miklos Szeredi to see if he can shed some light on the 
loopback <-> FUSE combination...
