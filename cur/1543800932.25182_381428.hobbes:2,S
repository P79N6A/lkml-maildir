I agree. I see a lot of steam blowing and hot air from people complaining 
about ALSA. Your API is perfectly usable and aptly translates generic issues 
with any sound hardware (such as xruns and hardware buffering) without hiding 
them away so they cannot be manipulated.
The only significant issue with ALSA is the number of tunables that you have 
to set with individual function calls. Personally, I like this approach, but 
I do always end up wrapping them in some structure, so perhaps you could have 
a "quick and dirty" one liner that would either be:
snd_hw_set_params (fd, ... long list of sensible parameters ...)
snd_sw_set_params (fd, ... ditto ...)
Or, take an ioctl approach (which people here seem to love; urgh):
struct hw_params my_hw_params = {
	PCM_LE_16,
	2,
	blah,
};
...
snd_hw_set_params (fd, &my_hw_params);
snd_sw_set_params (fd, &my_sw_params);
I think your time is better spent addressing the issues of "bloat" in the 
kernel side of things (the more code in userspace the better, despite what 
ridiculous statements there have been on this thread to the contrary).
_Documentation_ clearly distinguishing between "sw" paramters and "hw" 
parameters would also be good, as when I first learnt ALSA (some 3 years 
ago), I didn't even know what these were!
