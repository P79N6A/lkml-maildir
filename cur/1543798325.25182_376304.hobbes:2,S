Oops. It was defined as a module. Compiling it statically gave me
the console back. Interestingly, I still lose the first 102 lines
of console output. After the all-important boot logo displays, I see
nothing until this line:
"Console: switching to colour frame buffer device 160x64"
It's all there in the ring buffer, of course. Thanks, Antonino.
