Below are two more problems with the patch, one of which existed in the
original Greg's patch resulting in return with "Message too long"
(EMSGSIZE) from driver's open() function.

There should be '*/' at the end of this line, not '/*', otherwise the
driver even doesn't compile.

Here, it should obviously be port->bulk_in_endpointAddress, not
port->bulk_out_endpointAddress, otherwise devices that have endpoints
numeration like, say 0x01-out, 0x82-in (unlike more usual usual
0x01-out, 0x81-in), won't work returning -EMSGSIZE from open().
After these fixes, I've been able to run the driver with my own USB
device and achieved about 320 Kbytes/s read speed. That's still not very
exciting as I have another driver here in development that seems to be
able to do about 650 Kbytes/s with the same device.
