in-source annotations can do more:
- inlines could be driven by profile data: if a function is used in a 
  hot path and it's used only once, it makes sense to inline that 
  function into that hot path - because the kernel size increase will be 
  in the cold portion.
- we could drive the likely/unlikely annotations via profiling data.
OTOH i think that _most_ of the benefit (80% :-) could be achieved via 
the much simpler (and more robust) link-time-reordering solution. It is 
also alot less intrusive, and can still be presented in some plain-text 
format that can be distributed along the upstream kernel:
	linux/profiles/webserver.list
	linux/profiles/database-server.list
	linux/profiles/desktop.list
	linux/profiles/beowulf-node.list
and users could pick their profile at build time / relink time. There is 
no binary compatibility problem with such plaintext lists - they dont 
have to be fully complete, nor do they have to be fully accurate - they 
dont impact correctness in any way. In fact profiles could merge all 
architectures into one file, so they would be pretty generic as well.
