 Well I never meant it to be merged, but Andi picked it up from Bugzilla
bug #3927, added some bugs of his own, then sent it on.
 This bug was mine, though: just checking for vendor == ATI was a bad idea.
Current earlyquirk code actually looks at PCI bridges instead of host bridge,
so to get an accurate test I guess it needs to look at PCI dev 00:00.0 and
check both vendor and device ID.  As new models come out they will have to
be added one by one.
 With a real understanding of what's going on maybe this problem can be solved
reliably with generic code, but it's beyond me...
