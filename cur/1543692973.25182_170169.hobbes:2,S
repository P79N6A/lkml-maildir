no idea, but likely it wasn't affected. This was an ultra optimization I
did, it was very aggressive and it broke the archs with the pte-dirty
bit handled in software.
this is also the proof that the pte_* abstraction is not trasparent at
all, and we definitely need a compile time #define to differentiate the
two cases (I added it in the above patch for x86 and x86-64 and as said
above this patch is infact an obvious noop for those two archs).
This is the code that broke it. the 'page' pointed by the pte is an
exclusive page at that point, it means it's not shared by any other
"mm" and it's of course an anonymous page. It can be in the swapcache or
not, it doesn't make any difference (if it's not in the swapcache it's
guaranteed to be marked PG_dirty at the phyiscal level).
		if (write_access)
			pte = pte_mkdirty(pte);
		if (vma->vm_flags & VM_WRITE)
			pte = pte_mkwrite(pte);
This code is perfectly correct and it's more efficient than the
software-dirty-bitflag because it avoids a copy-on-write page fault if
this was a read access. If it was a read access we want to mark the pte
writeable but not dirty, so if the page is still in the swapcache and
nobody writes to it, we can swap out it zerocost. And at the same time
we avoid any copy-on-write pagefault if somebody writes later to the
page after we instantiated the mapping.
This is instead the version needed by archs with the dirty bit in
software like ppc/s390/s390x/ppc64/alpha (there maybe more).
		if (write_access)
			pte = pte_mkdirty(pte_mkwrite(pte));
On these archs we simply can't mark the pte writeable if we don't mark
it dirty too, or somebody can write to the swappage and we would never
notice, and the kernel would think it can swapout zerocost (swapcache
still clean), while it really should do the I/O in that case.
The bug wasn't too bad, just a segfault or data corruption in userspace
during heavy swapping. The kernel was stable, there's no way to crash
the kernel forgetting a dirty bit. So it was also hardly noticeable. And
if you had zero swap it simply couldn't trigger because no swapcache
could be allocated. So the workaround swapoff -a is 100% reliable.
