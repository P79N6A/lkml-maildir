Hmmm, OK.
Although I have to say, I measured three times -- Under 2.3.47-plain I
had a difference of 1.2 seconds! 
Still, the macro SAVE_ALL in include/asm-i386/hw_irq.h is part of it, as
well, which is used for every Interrupt, as far as I can see...
(including the timer-interrupt)

Again, how many interrupts do occur during a full compile ?
I counted 107 system calls, when compiling an empty C-file (main(){},
nothing else):
strace gcc -Wall -O2 -pipe -o gcc_sys_calls gcc_sys_calls.c 2>&1 | less
Now, depending on how many files to include, it should be considerably
more.
Of the 5480 .c, .h and .S -files currently in 2.3.47 (make distclean) --
after compiling (make oldconfig dep bzlilo), I have 269 object-files.
So the lowest number of possible system-calls are ~28783 system-calls
(of course assuming, there is no include<>, no linking).
So after all, just counting system-calls (w/o interrupts), I'd say,
there are a lot more than 100k system-calls.

Thanks!
According to Your program, under 2.3.47-plain I get 159 cyles and
2.3.47-OPT I get 151 cycles.
Is that plausible ?!
