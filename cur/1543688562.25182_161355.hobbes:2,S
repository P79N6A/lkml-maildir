yes, at this point in time I'm willing to merge only anything that is an
obvious improvement. More doubious things would better go in 2.6.
I didn't see the patch in question, Shantanu, if you're interested to
merge it in -aa, could you submit against 2.4.22pre7aa1? Otherwise I'll
check it and possibly merge it myself later (i've quite some backlog to
merge already for the short term, but it can go in queue)

didn't check it yet.
