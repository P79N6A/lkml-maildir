since anything starting with . is considered a 'hidden' file per *nix 
tradition it's ignored by many programs and optionally ignored by most 
others (and anything that doesn't ignore . files when presending files to 
the user has many other problems on modern desktop systems anyway ;-)
the only trouble I ever had with the .snapshot approach is when tar or 
find would decend down into the .snapshot when I didn't really intend for 
it to do so.
