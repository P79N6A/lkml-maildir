	The May 2003 issue did include an article from Erez Zadok on the 
topic of the FiST project (File System Translator), which is exactly what 
you're looking for.
	The project homepage is at 
http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/~ezk/research/fist/
 .  There are links there 
to the language specification (see his phd dissertation), downloadable 
code, sample filesystems, and a mailing list.
	Cheers,
	- Bill
