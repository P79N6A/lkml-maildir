This patch breaks all of usermode from the change above.
There's also no reason to avoid other cleanups in the area you're 
changing (and testing) such as moving the asterisk for pointers to the 
variable name, deleting extraneous whitespace, or changing the several 
instances in this patch where kzalloc conversion is appropriate.  If it's 
not done now, it will either be forgotten or another patch on the same 
elaborate scale as this one will need to fix it incrementally.  Given the 
high chance of typos such as the one above in broad patches like this, all 
the changes should be rolled together into one patch that is at least 
inspected before submission by the author.
