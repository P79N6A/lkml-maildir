Well it's the same as the bug which was recently added to 2.6:
- dev_close() used to do
	test_bit(__LINK_STATE_RX_SCHED, &dev->state);
- the netif_poll_disable() in tg3.c used to do
	test_and_set_bit(__LINK_STATE_RX_SCHED, &dev->state);
- someone copied the tg3 netif_poll_disable() into netdevice.h and then
  used it in dev_close(), thus changing and presumably breaking
  dev_close().
I haven't tested this yet, but it'll probably fix things for all NICs and
it might break tg3.  In which case it's a net win ;)
