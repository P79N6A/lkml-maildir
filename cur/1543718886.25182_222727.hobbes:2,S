Wow. And this architecture claims to support SMP?

The race is:
 - one CPU sets the dirty bit (possibly with a hardware walker, but I 
   guess on PA it's probably done in sw)
 - the other CPU sets the accessed bit in sw as part of the 
   "handle_pte_fault()" processing.
Right now we set the accessed bit with a simple "ptep_establish()", which 
will use "set_pte()", which is just a regular write. So setting the 
accessed bit will basically be a nonatomic sequence of
 - read pte entry
 - entry = pte_mkyoung(entry)
 - set_pte(entry)
which is all done under the mm->page_table_lock, but which does NOT 
protect against any hardware page-table walkers or any asynchronous sw 
walkers (if anybody does them).
Basically, the suggestion is to replace the "set_pte()" with something 
that is safe against anything else that updates the page tables (whether 
software or hardware). If only core kernel code does that, then you should 
already be fine, since the page-table spinlock should already be held by 
all updaters.
NOTE! One really easy approach would be to say that we never mix software 
updates of the accessed bit with hw updates, and just have a rule that if 
the architecture does accessed-bit updates in hardware (and can thus race 
with us doing them in software _despite_ the fact that we hold the page 
table lock), then we just don't do the update at all. 
We'd just pass in a flag to "ptep_establish()" to tell it whether we
changed the dirty bit or not. It would be "write_access" in
handle_pte_fault(), and 1 in the other two cases.

Yes. You'd really have to work at it _not_ to support them ;)
However, the atomic write case only helps in the case when we update _all_ 
the bits that hw walkers can update,
