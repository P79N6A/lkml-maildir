Hi,
Here are updated patches getting usb-ohci and usb-uhci to
behave on an ac20 kernel with slab debugging enabled.
It uses the pci_pool API, discussed earlier.
- pcipool-0323.patch ... adds pci_pool apis to <linux/pci.h>;
    bugfixes vs what I sent to linux-usb-devel yesterday
- ohci-0323.patch ... basically what I sent yesterday
- uhci-0323.patch ... bugfixes vs what I sent yesterday;
    adds a fix for an unrelated oops (referencing an urb
    after the completion function freed it)
I don't know about any problems with these, but that doesn't
mean they're not lurking.  Converting usb-ohci to use the rest
of the pci dma mapping APIs is being done separately, and
I think Johannes has an update pending to "uhci.c".  The EHCI
host controller driver (latest) is also using "pci_pool".
Does anyone want particularly want to see further discussion
about the pci_pool API?  This version dropped the explicit
address mapping primitive that was contentious last time,
and nothing else appeared to be troublesome.  (Shouldn't be!)
This version does add another pci_pool_create() parameter,
as needed to handle a 4KB-crossing restriction for ehci.  That
verges on too many arguments, any more and I'd want them
wrapped into a (readonly) structure.
