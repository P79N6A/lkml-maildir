Heck no.  That mechanism is just as much about fairness as it is about
intertactivity, and as such is just fine and dandy in my book... once
it's toned down a bit^H^H^Htruckload.  What I'm doing isn't biasing
against the intent, I'm merely straightening the huge bend in favor of
interactive tasks who get this added boost over and over again, and
restricting the general effect to something practical.
Just look at what that mechanism does now with a 10 deep queue.  Every
dinky sleep can have an absolutely huge gob added to it, the exact worst
case number depends on how many cpus you have and whatnot.  Start a slew
of tasks, and you are doomed to have every task that sleeps for the
tiniest bit pegged at max interactive.
Maybe what I did isn't the best that can be done, but something has to
be done about that.  It is very b0rken under heavy load.
