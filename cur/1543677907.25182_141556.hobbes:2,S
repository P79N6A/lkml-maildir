Hi,
Regarding this issue I have been advised to setup a serial console to
capture the 'kernel panic' debug output. For the record, I can get the
panic from the BASH prompt _before_ starting X/WM just by mounting my
CDRW drive.
However, I think I need some advice on setting up the serial console. I
have attached another PC (WinXP with HyperTerminal) serially to my panic
Linux PC. Following the Remote Terminal HOWTO I have achieved some
success... but all I see on HyperTerminal is:
   LILO 22.3.2 boot:
   Loading Linux_2.4.21................
   BIOS data check successful
   Mandrake Linux release 9.0 (dolphin) for i586
   Kernel 2.4.21 on an i686 / ttyS0
   telekon.davesnet login:
It seems to start piping the stuff to ttyS0, but then gives up after
a few progress-dots: I'm missing the main kernel blurb (its all on the
attached monitor), and also the panic stuff appears only on the attached
monitor.
Excerpt of butchered lilo.conf
boot=/dev/hda
map=/boot/map
#vga=normal
default=Linux_2.4.21
keytable=/boot/uk.klt
prompt
nowarn
timeout=100
#message=/boot/message
#menu-scheme=wb:bw:wb:bw
ignore-table
# serial term bits
serial = 0,9600n8
image = /boot/vmlinuz-2.4.21
	root = /dev/hda3
	label = Linux_2.4.21
	read-only
#	vga=788
	append = "devfs=mount hdd=ide-scsi console=tty0 console=ttyS0,9600n8"
Any help gratefully recieved!
Thanks
Dave
