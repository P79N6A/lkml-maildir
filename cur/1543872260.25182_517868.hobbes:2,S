Thanks Dave.  It seems expensive to change all the skb's if this type of
event occurs, but I suppose it is a corner case and can be tolerated.
Please let me make this change and I'll resubmit.
Also, the first patch set was RFC, and you were the only one to submit
feedback to me.  :-/  So I figured submitting as an official patch for
feedback might get more attention.
And to reiterate what Auke asked, what did happen to the patches?  I see
things getting through the netdev mailing list, but they're not showing
up on www.spinics.net/lists/netdev.  Was it something I did when
sending, or did majordomo hiccup?
Thanks,
