Ok - I almost have my crosstool installation healthy again.
I will actually see to it that my patch builds this time for
whatever arch's I can test on, and send this simple disabling
of sched domain mangling from cpuset-land as a real patch.
I have a couple other commitments - it will be 6 to 12 hours
before I send it in, unless someone asks for a half-baked
version sooner.

Yup.  Agreed.
Thanks for looking into this, Nick.
