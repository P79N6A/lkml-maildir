Russel, I agree this should be clearly marked and an oops seems okay here,
but we're talking dead systems here (dead as in all interrupts masked type
of dead). Most users won't even be aware an oops occured, let alone be able
to read the messages on the console. 
I was just lucky because after the first one I got (#5958, a regular oops)
I tried to nail it down in text mode, with the console loglevel upped a
bit, so I was able to see what the panic (#6131) was all about.
I think we really need those *_ON()s at least in uart_write().
Best regards,
