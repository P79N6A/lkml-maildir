The underlying hypothesis for suggesting explicitly flagging
candidates for killing is of course that it doesn't see who
exactly is misbehaving :-) Since this issue has been around for
a nummber of years, I think it's fair to assume that the OOM
killers indeed have a problem in that area.

I guess that depends a lot on your scenario. If your system is
the typical undergrad mainframe where an army of students is
hard at work trying to fork-bomb it out of existence, you're
absolutely right.
However, on a system where new programs are rarely added to the
mix, the distinction should be easier. You can still get
unexpected problems, e.g. vi trying to load a huge file, but
you should be in a much better position to profile your system
behaviour.
It could of course be that this scenario is overly specific.

I'd view it as an additional hint that killing that process is
likely to help, a) because it may be the culprit, or b) because
it is likely to hold lots of memory, and its death will not be
mourned.
I'm not suggesting to use this as a replacement for an adaptive
OOM killer. The OOM killer could first make its pick among the
suspects, and only if it runs out of them (or maybe if it finds
overwhelming evidence that it's something else), then it would
go after non-suspects.

Yes, that's yet another scenario. Even then, having a list of
things we can kill to give us some room would be useful.

Ah, now I understand why you'd want to swap. Interesting. Now,
depending on the time if day, you have typically "interactive"
processes, like your idle desktop, turn into "non-interactive"
ones, which can then be subjected to swapping. Nice example
against static classification :-)

iii) may also affect i). If you're going to swap, you don't want
to wait until you're fighting for the last available page in the
system.
