.EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS is pretty much required as long as we do recursive
makes.  People on linux-kbuild are discussing better configuration
methods and cleaning up the Makefiles, including removing make
recursion, but it is not going to be ready for 2.4.  IMHO we have to
accept the xargs and DRIVER-* kludges for 2.4 and redo the Makefiles
for 2.5.  Converting the make system to non-recursive will
automatically fix both the xargs and DRIVERS-* problems.
