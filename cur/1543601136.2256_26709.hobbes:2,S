Subject: 2.4.10-pre9 min/max raises "const" warnings

try this one:
  int a, b, c, d;
  d = min( a, min( b, c ));
and you will see a gnu c warning about multiple const qualifiers.
(this might depend on the warning level you drive.)
fix it with this code:
  #define min(x,y) ({ \
      const typeof(x) _x = (x);       \
      const typeof(y) _y = (y);       \
      (void) (&_x == &_y);            \
      (_x < _y) ? (typeof(x)) _x : (typeof(y)) _y; })
simply the last line has changed towards linux kernel patch-2.4.10-pre9 from
ftp.
the same change should apply for the max() macro.
i am yet not sure if the used "? :" operator set does qualify as
a left-value. maybe this could be another important reason why 
return types here should stay identical to input types.
