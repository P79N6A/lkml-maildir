I got bit by the same thing when I was implementing a kthread that sleeps
on skb_recv_datagram() (=> wait_for_packet) with noblock = 0 over a netlink
socket. I need to use the same SIGKILL hack before kthread_stop() to ensure
the kthread does wake up *and* unblock from skb_recv_datagram() when the
module is being unloaded. Searched hard, but just couldn't find a prettier
solution (if someone knows, please let me know).

I agree.

Yes, why not embed a send_sig(SIGKILL) just before the wake_up_process()
in kthread_stop() itself?
Looking at some happily out-of-date comments in the kthread code, I can
guess that at some point of time (perhaps very early drafts) Rusty actually
*did* implement the whole kthread_stop() functionality using signals, but
I suspect it might've been discarded and the kthread_stop_info approach
used instead to protect from spurious signals from userspace. (?)
So could we have signals in _addition_ to kthread_stop_info and change
kthread_should_stop() to check for both:
kthread_stop_info.k == current && signal_pending(current)
If !kthread_should_stop() && signal_pending(current) => spurious signal,
so just flush and discard (in the kthread).

Why is it wrong for kthreads to let signals through? We can ignore out
all signals we're not interested in, and flush the spurious ones ...
otherwise there really isn't much those kthreads can do that get blocked
in such functions, is there?
