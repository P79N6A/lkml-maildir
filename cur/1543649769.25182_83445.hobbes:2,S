As you likely already know, this is a kernel / BIOS issue, not a 3Com
driver issue.  This problem will exist with any CardBus card that uses
interrupts (almost every device).

You can also try "noapic", although that's almost never a issue on a
laptop.  (It's more likely to be an issue on a desktop with a
PCI-CardBus adapter.)

Yup, I'm guessing this is one of them thar' VAIO-ACPI issues.

Does the FireWire work properly?  It's sitting on the same secondary PCI
bus as the CardBus.

Presumably this is work fine as well.
