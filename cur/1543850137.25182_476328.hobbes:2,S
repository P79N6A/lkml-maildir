You're still entirely missing the problem.
Take a look at 
http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xsh/sync.html
and the linux sync(2) manpage.  The only thing sync guarantees is writing
out all in-memory data to disk.  It doesn't even gurantee completion,
although we've been synchronous in Linux for a while.
What it does not gurantee is where on disk the data is located.  Now for
a journaling filesystem pushing everything to the log is the easiest way
to complete sync, and it's perfectly valid - if the system crashes after
the sync and before data is written back to it's normal place on disk
the system notices it's not been unmounted cleanly and will do a log
recovery.  In the suspend case however the system neither crashes nor
is unmounted - thus the filesystem doesn't know it has to recover the
log.  We have to choices to fix this:
 (1) force a log recovery of an already mounted and in use filesystem
 (2) make sure data is in the right place before suspending
(1) is pretty nasty, and hard to do across filesystems.  (2) is already
implemented and easily useable by the suspend code.
