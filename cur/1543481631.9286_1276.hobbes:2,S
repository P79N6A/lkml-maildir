Hello,
I beleive that the tulip nic driver is broken.  I've tried using it as a
module and compiled into the kernel and it won't work.  As I mentioned
in a previous posting, the card is picked up in /proc/ioports but not in
/proc/interupts.  I also have a ne2k-pci nic installed and it is working
fine.
Cheers, Luc.
