True, but I wanted the patch to only do a single well defined thing. I was 
not 100% sure what the reaction to such a patch would be, so I didn't want 
to mix other things in as well...  Actually, thinking about it a bit; will 
gcc ever generate different code for NULL pointers cast to different 
types? As far as I know it won't, but if it will, then the casts could 
actually make sense.
I can submit a second patch to remove the casts of kmalloc return values if 
wanted.
