Hey, thanks for the nifty tool.  What docs are available so that I can
  learn the Magic of the Script?  :)
Anyhow, the output for 2.5.20:
linux-2.5.20:9$ ./reference_discarded.pl 
Finding objects, 784 objects, ignoring 0 module(s)
Finding conglomerates, ignoring 102 conglomerate(s)
Scanning objects
Error: ./drivers/usb/host/uhci-hcd.o .rodata refers to 00000f98 R_386_32          .text.exit
Error: ./drivers/usb/host/built-in.o .rodata refers to 00000f98 R_386_32          .text.exit
Done
Looks like uhci-hcd.o and built-in.o are the culprits.  Now, if only
  I knew what the rest meant.  :)  They're referring to a symbol 
  R_386_32?  I'm going to assume this is an x86-based bit of stuff
  included from the x86-specific stuff.  Teach me.  ;)
