UNIX (and Linux) already has a feature for use in case of forkbombs, 
namely keeping a shell available, at a high priority, from which you 
manage a wide range of undesired situations.  There isn't, that I know 
of, any program which responds to a magic key and does the work, but I 
think it can be written without requiring any additional kernel support.
