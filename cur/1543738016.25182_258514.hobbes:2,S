NB: I dont disagree with you.
Just the impression I get is that there is no way to avoid this 
situation without a serious performance impact, and that the 
optimisation shouldnt really any affect any healthy app. (any which 
are really should be setting O_NONBLOCK).
If you could follow the spec without significantly harming 
performance, then I'd agree spec should be followed.
I dont really have anything useful to say other than that, IMHO, a 
sane app should be using O_NONBLOCK if it really does not want to 
block, so I shall now quietly back away from this thread.
