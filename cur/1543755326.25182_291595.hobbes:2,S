It appears that in 2.6.9 the ppc64 version of flush_tlb_page() depends 
on two symbols which are not currently exported: the function 
__flush_tlb_pending(), and the per-cpu variable ppc64_tlb_batch.
Is there any particular reason why modules should not be allowed to 
flush the tlb, or is this an oversight?
