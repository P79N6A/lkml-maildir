Hi,
I've recently gotten email related to Red Hat's 7.0 beta, and a module compile
tracking down the correct module header files. It claimed that a new method
had
been "blessed on linux-kernel" and involved using /lib/modules/`uname
-r`/build
I wanted to check on the details of this, and whether it was legit or not. 
Thanks,
Terence Ripperda
