I don't know for sure if this is related or not, but it sure sounds like 
it. I have noticed the following in at least the last few versions (I 
believe 2.6.9-rc2 also): Even though CONFIG_SECURITY_CAPABILITIES can be 
configured as a module, if I don't compile it into the kernel getcap and 
setcap fail.
