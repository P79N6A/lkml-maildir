How about not playing around with fat detection and instead implement a 
force mount flag for FAT, which would ignore all (most?) detection errors.  
Of course if errors occured later you'd end up with a R/O filesystem.  And if 
you forced something that wasn't FAT, you'd be screwed... but that's to be 
expected...
