I disagree - it's extremely rare. We've probably had more *software* 
problems with cpufreq than we've had real hardware problems (ie all the 
locking for cpufreq has been pretty painful).
It's also something that probably depends a lot on the particular CPU. 
Some CPU's have very short PLL relocking, and continue running while the 
voltage is changed. Others seem to stop for much longer times. This is not 
somethign that the USB layer should stick its fingers in - because quite 
frankly, it really doesn't have a clue.

Normally the memory bus isn't reclocked (it's *possible* to do, but it's 
complex and can be quite fragile). I think the issue was just that the CPU 
itself was reclocked, and had long latencies for probing the cache. Not 
unlike a sleep state: there can be long DMA latencies just from the CPU 
being in S1!
So adding this special case for CPU frequency is not at all unlike adding 
a special case saying that the CPU cannot go into "halt" state, because 
the DMA latency is too high.
Have we done that? Yes. We actually had a "no-hlt" kernel command line 
flag that literally disabled halting the CPU, because it apparently caused 
problems for some floppy disk setups (and yes, the main reasonable 
explanation was some bad DMA interaction, we never figured it out).
So it might be much better if we instead re-introduced that kind of "DMA 
latency requirement", and letting different subsystems react to that as 
they may.
It really can affect more than just cpufreq - I would not be in the 
*least* surprised if C3 latencies and other things can cause these things 
too! But even within cpufreq, it's quite likely to hit certain situations 
more than others.
(Of course, if C3 latencies are high on a MB that has known DMA latency 
issues, you'd hope that the BIOS has simply disabled C3 entirely in the 
ACPI tables)

Yes, that would be more acceptable, I think. 
It is also quite likely that this is not a generic cpufreq issue, but one 
that happens with just a certain class of CPU's - ie some particular CPU 
that is just slower than others at re-clocking.
Just disabling things blindly on cpufreq events, when what it actually 
wants to do is say "I need low DMA latency", and then the cpu-freq layer 
(which can know about these things) may decide internally that it knows 
that a particular setup is not able to have low-latency DMA durign 
frequency relocking.
On other - saner - CPU's, the frequency relock may take a fraction of the 
time, and the CPU is running perfectly the whole time - and it would _not_ 
be affected.

Ok. But in the meantime, I really think we should just revert the code 
that causes a known regression.
Because, quite frankly, you may not like VIA, but in the bigger picture, 
VIA has been a hell of a lot better than Broadcom.
