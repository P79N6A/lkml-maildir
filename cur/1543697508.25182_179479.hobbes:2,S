Hmm.. the output doesn't match the fprintf()s. Doesn't give me
warm fuzzies...

Alternate theory - the last time through the loop, you get to the fprintf() of
totalread, you go INTO that call, the output makes it out, but some final
malloc() call *within fprintf* or something fails due to being out of memory
(or any number of other failure modes due to being almost but not totally out
of memory), so you never return to start the next iteration of the loop.
