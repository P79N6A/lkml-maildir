Hi,
I have found that while allocating (mostly it is done) the pages in
__alloc_pages(), after successfully allocating the page the
zone_statistics() function is called.
static void zone_statistics(struct zonelist *zonelist, struct zone *z)
{
#ifdef CONFIG_NUMA
.....
#endif
}
The whole body of this function is enclosed b/w #ifdef ... #endif.
This function is called each time and does nothing if we don't have a NUMA
machine.
Can we put the call for this b/w #ifdef ... #endif?
Although the gcc -O3 option does not generate a function call if the
function body is nil.
The patch for the same is given below:
diff -Nru linux-2.6.11.11.orig/mm/page_alloc.c

        }
        return NULL;
 got_pg:
+#ifdef CONFIG_NUMA
        zone_statistics(zonelist, z);
+#endif
        return page;
 }
Further, I have not removed the #ifdef ... #endif from zone_statistics() as
in future some other function might call this function, but in present
kernel no one calls this.
Comments are invited..
