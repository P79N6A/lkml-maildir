Good. POSIX ACLs are awful. Somebody stop the ext2 developers before
it is too late. With a tiny bit of thought, it should be obvious
that the inheritance system is broken. ACL systems that are much better
include those of NT, Netware, Digital Unix...
Considering the power (yes!) and popularity of NT ACLs, they would
be a better choice than Netware or Digital Unix ACLs.
BTW: the admin tools on NT do not expose the awesome power of the
underlying architecture. There is more than meets the eye.
