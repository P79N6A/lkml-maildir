Hi Ben,

I'm very impressed at how well things are supported.  I had to buy a USB
wireless dongle, the Linksys WUSB12 (which works great), thanks to
Broadcom's proprietariness about the Airport Extreme, but other than that,
almost everything is automagic.

Actually, it's got a GeForce FX Go 5200.
I just grabbed your 2.6 tree and see the same things happening.

Oh joy.  I've heard great things about Forth :)

Cool.  I think backlight control, drive spindown, and CPU frequency
scaling should go a fairly long way on the battery life front.  Speaking
of CPU scaling, do you know if it should work on this machine?  I selected
it in the kernel config, but /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0 is empty.
Just for reference, /proc/cpuinfo is:
cpu             : 7457, altivec supported

Oh, I just noticed something else in dmesg:
    PMU driver 2 initialized for Core99, firmware: 0c
*shrug*
I grabbed the newest Darwin/xnu source I could find from Apple, and I can
no longer find where they do the backlight control - it used to be in
iokit/Drivers/platform/drvApplePMU .  I'll have to look more closely
tomorrow...
Again, many thanks for your work on this platform.
Cheers,
dstn.
