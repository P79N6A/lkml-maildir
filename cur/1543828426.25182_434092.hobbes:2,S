Yes.  Although I don't have a clue what big scsi has to do with a
telco systems.

What is a few time?

Yes kernel failures will occur, people and hardware are imperfect.
But the should be quite rare, on the telco gear you were talking
about.

Ok.  A simple outb to the BMC through the IPMI interface.

It depends very much on what you are doing.  We have C code that
runs before the dump kernel is started.  It would be absolutely
trivial to modify that C code to tell the IPMI controller that
something has happened.  That operation can happen then after
it has checked a checksum of itself.

Certainly.  But a system with hundreds of disks isn't the system
with a millisecond response time limit.  In general you don't need
to initialize all of your disks just to take a crash dump so even
without optimizing the kernel the kernel things are slow.
