Ok, with Marc-Christian's change and my guess about --oformat I am
able to build and install the kernel and its modules.  It actually
even boots.
One last thing, the kernel version seems to have regressed a bit.  It
thinks it's 2.4.0.
Dave, I haven't had a chance to look at the URL you suggested yet (and
probably do not have the expertise to fix things the way you're
suggesting either); is Marc-Christian's fix safe in the mean time?
