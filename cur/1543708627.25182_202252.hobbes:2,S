The only 'issue' running in 64-bit mode on AMD-64 I know of was where there
was data corruption when the IOMMU flushing scheme changed.  I think Andi
sent out an email
where this was reverted.  If it wasn't, all you need to do is run with
iommu=fullflush
and you shouldn't have any other trouble.
What other issues are there?

Do these 'issues' prevent the cards from being used at all in 64bit mode on 
AMD-64?
We'd really like to use the 4-port SATA 3Ware card on a Tyan Thunder K8W 
(S2885) but it'd be a bit of a waste if we can only use it in 32bit mode. (I
assume 32bit mode means you compile for i686 instead of AMD-64 ?)
Mark.
