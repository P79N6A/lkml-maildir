We just don't have a good solution to this.
`select' is bust and it's unobvious how it can _not_ be bust.  If you're
selecting something whose dependencies aren't met, what can we do?  Maybe
select the thing it depends on as well?  What if it depends on (A||B)? 
Which one do we force on?  Screwed.
And hiding options from the users until theyve gone elsewher and selected
something else is most user-hostile.
At least we have menuconfig's "/" command, so if you know the option's name
you can work out why it isn't appearing.
I think what we should do is to continue to offer the unselectable option
in manuconfig and friends, only "greyed out" in some fashion.  So the user
can still navigate to it and select the "what do you depend on" button.

People would complain about that too.  I don't know what to do, sorry. 
Muddle through :(
