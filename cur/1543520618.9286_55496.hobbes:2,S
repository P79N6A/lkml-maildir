Maybe using the word "internet" is too constrictive a word. Maybe
Intranet and Internet (plus any other net you wish to add). Embedded
systems are more and more becominig TCP/IP based and their owns/creators
(oh yea and Marketing too!) are envisioning anywhere to anywhere
connectivity using whatever communication media is available (internet
maybe). That 1K PIC with a PPP connection can just as easily be made
with an 8K Flash PIC (plenty of room) & a CS8900 but it's real 10BaseT
(see 
http://www.ibutton.com/TINI/hardware/index.html
 for a real
example for less than $100 US).
Please don't dismiss embedded Linux's future so quickly. The embedded
community is the largest community (and one where I think Intel is not
#1).
