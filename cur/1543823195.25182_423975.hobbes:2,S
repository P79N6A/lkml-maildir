That's an excellent point - most developers who are likely to want to test
NUMA have x86_64 boxes and x86_64 has NUMA-emulation-on-SMP.  I'd
semi-forgotten that it existed.
This rather weakens the reasons for retaining support for
NUMA-on-non-summit-x86.  Ingo?

Not really.  If a bug affects something we don't care about (like this)
I'll just ignore it.  I care about the number of busted machines out there,
not the bug counts...

So shouldn't such a patch remove that code rather than panicing?
