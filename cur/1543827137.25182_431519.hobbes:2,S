Hello
I ran the sysbench benchmark to compare the CSCAN I/O scheduler
against the CFQ scheduler and following are the results. The results
are interesting especially in case of sequential writes and the random
workloads
                                            Latency (seconds)
               seq            seq         seq             rnd
 rnd         rnd
               reads         writes      r + w          reads
writes      r + w
