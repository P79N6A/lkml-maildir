subject says it. I built 2.0.36 with egcs-1.1, everything works quite
normal except the X-Server dumps core, regardsless if I start SVGA, VGA16
or Mach64 (in my case) server.
I don't have the nerve to compile the XServer myself with -g ;-)
so, just to let you know, that there is some kind of problem with egcs.
