enable, index and id are common options for all modules.
the id is the identifier string for this card instance and must be
unique.  it's used as the directory name in /proc/asound, as the tag
in /etc/asound.state, and so on.
you can pass the arbitray string via option, or the null string so
that the driver chooses an approriate name.
