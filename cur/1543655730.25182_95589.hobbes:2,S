hmm. I'm very very unfamiliar with this thing. So when I first tried
to install it I downloaded latest bonding code against 2.4.20 from
sf.net/projects/bonding , patched my kernel with it and etc etc ...
... skipping ...
boot. ip ad flush dev eth{0,1}
modprobe bonding miimon=100
ip ad add myip/mymask brd + dev bond0
ifenslave bond0 eth0 eth1
ip li set bond0 up
switch on the other side (3com superstack 3) configured for trunking
on that 2 ports.
and then
ping $addr_on_local_net do nothing
hmm
tcpdump -i bond0 -vvv -n host $addr_on_local_net
will show me arp replies that $addr_on_local_net is on some
mac_address but
ip ne sh
will show that arp lookup is incomplete then failed
What's wrong?
Maybe other patches I've put in conflicting with this?
