I've tested this patch for about a week now, by applying it to
the 2.6.17-rc3 kernel on my laptop, which I've been using
for more than a month now. This patch seems to cure the
mysterious symptoms reported in February:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/2/6/167
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/2/6/170
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/2/13/424
etc.
Actually I didn't remember to check "Dirty:" in /proc/meminfo,
but when I "sync"ed at the end of my workday, just prior to
swsupending it, sync returned immediately. with unpatched
2.6.17-rc3, sync would take half a minute. Maybe Mark can give
this patch a spin to check if it cures his problem, too.
(I still use vmware, so vmware was not the culprit.)
Thanks,
Johannes
