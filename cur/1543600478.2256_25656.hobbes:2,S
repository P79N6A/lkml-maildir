Are you kidding?  We will be lucky to see this in during 2.5.
Its a pretty big change.  It makes the Linux kernel preemptible.   This
is a fairly big move, one I don't think any of the major Unices have
done.  The only reason the patch is not _huge_ is because the Linux
kernel is already setup for concurrency of this nature -- it does SMP.
I suggest you read
