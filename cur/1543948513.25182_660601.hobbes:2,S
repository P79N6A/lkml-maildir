Both ways are OK with me too, although Al's change leaves the trap in
the anon_inode_getfd() in that all users have to keep in mind the race
against close() from another thread.  Also Al's change moves all
documentation to __anon_inode_getfd() and leaves anon_inode_getfd()
undocumented, which is a little suboptimal.
With Al's change the 2/2 patch would have to change uverbs to use the
__anon_inode_getfd() variant and change the fd_install() in uverbs to
use fput().  If there is consensus that Al's patch will be merged for
2.6.26 I will write that patch and send it to Al to merge via his
tree, so that get_empty_filp() can be unexported.
