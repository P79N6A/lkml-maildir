And if you look at the current users, you'll see that only two of 15
actually use it.

Just about everywhere, get_byte prints an error message and halts. In
the final refactoring, get_byte goes away and is replaced by a
->fill() method that's only called when the input buffer is emptied,
rather than byte by byte. Most of the users leave this null (since
they have the entire contents in memory already), which will give us a
nice oops. I can add another patch in the next batch that makes an
attempt to call a null ->fill instead do ->error("gunzip underrun").
