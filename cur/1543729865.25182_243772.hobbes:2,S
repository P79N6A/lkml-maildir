Hello. I recently upgraded to 2.6.8.1 and my SATA disk stopped working.
As far as I can see, when the kernel boots the usual information about
my controller found by 2.6.7 is not shown. I still have 
CONFIG_SCSI_SATA_SIL=y and yet it won't find my root not even if I use root=/dev/sda5 or root=/dev/scsi/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part5. With 
2.6.7 I used root=/dev/discs/disc0/part5 and worked fine. Somebody has 
any ideia why this is happening?
TIA,
Joao Estevao.
