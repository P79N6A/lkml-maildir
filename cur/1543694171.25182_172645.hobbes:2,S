Subject: OK to set PF_MEMDIE on cleanup tasks?

Hello!
We have tasks that actively return memory to the system, which we
would like to exempt from the OOM killer, as killing such tasks under
low-memory conditions would indeed be counterproductive.  It looks like
the "official" way to do this is to catch/ignore signal 15, which results
in PF_MEMDIE being set (in the 2.6 kernel), thus preventing the OOM killer
from killing the task again.  I don't see where PF_MEMDIE is cleared,
though there are a number of subtle ways one might do this that I would
have missed.
So...  Is it considered legit to simply set PF_MEMDIE when creating
the cleanup task?  Or is there some reason that one should deal with
signal 15?
All enlightenment much appreciated!
						Thanx, Paul
