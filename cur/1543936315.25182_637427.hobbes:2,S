Subject: [PATCH 3/3] block: remove end_{queued|dequeued}_request()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/11/314

This patch removes end_queued_request() and end_dequeued_request(),
which are no longer used.
As a results, users of __end_request() became only end_request().
So the actual code in __end_request() is moved to end_request()
and __end_request() is removed.
