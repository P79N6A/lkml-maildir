No, you misunderstood. The card still verify the CRC. You can just instruct
it not to include it in the frame that you want to copy, e.g. say you
receive a 64-byte ethernet frame, then it can either tell you "copy from my
buffer 64 bytes" or if you're not interested in the CRC, "copy 60 bytes from
my buffer"
What I don't want is for the kernel to verify the CRC again since it's
already been done by the hardware (and I save 4 bytes on the copy (: )

Dope. Somehow I thought it was the "ethernet frame checksum" - not quite the
same thing :P
