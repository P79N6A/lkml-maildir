: Sounds good for the different processes case. But I was thinking of
: the shared VM case (threads), where you don't (ideally) even have to
: do that.

: Perhaps the best approach is to define extended send semantics to
: "send and I don't mind if my buffer is modified". That would be much
: simpler than stuffing around in the VM layer to do all kinds of
: tricks. Tricks that probably won't work in a shared VM environment
: anyway.
Yes, except that those semantics aren't what people are willing to accept.
And the tricks work just fine in a shared VM - you can mark anything
copy on write.  Besides, SGI uses sproc() for threads (an early version
of clone() ).
