Sounds good but I have to disagree on the X renice thing. It's not that I have 
a religious objection to renicing things. The problem is that our mainline 
scheduler determines latency also by nice level. This means that if you 
-renice a bursty cpu hog like X, then audio applications will fail unless 
they too are reniced. Try it on your patch.
