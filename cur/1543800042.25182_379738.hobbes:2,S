It's strongly recommended. I've now found that both SDRAMS with the same 
batch number are experiencing the same error with memtest, that's after 
I had a lockup with the one I thought was good. They will be replaced 
under lifetime warranty by Kingston memory. I've temporarily stuck a 
PC2700 512M stick in and it's been solid under memtest and with a full 
workload.
Regards
Sid.
