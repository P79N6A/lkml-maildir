Yepp, it would be cool, to move every low level graphical operation to the
 framebuffer devices ... So no more 'I would like to use framebuffer
console _AND_ X at the same time without disturbing each other' problem,
and also if X segfaults or such, consolse will not remain in unusable state.
Also a solid low level graphical operation layer should provide even 3D
acceleration for fbdev capable (but not X!) apps and of course for the
X server ... without conflicting each other :) DirectFB seems to be a good
idea anyway ...
