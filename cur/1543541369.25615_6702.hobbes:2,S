Actually, on MIPS r39xx initrd is linked to kernel, so I'd simply put
tar+rz into initrd which is linked to kernel. I thought about that
solution, and it would probably would work, but tar+rz can be pretty
big, and I was trying to minimize size. (Everything needs to be
uploaded over serial line -> size==speed).
