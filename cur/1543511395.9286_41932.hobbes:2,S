hi folks,
i'm currently working on some code size optimizations for
the linux kernel (e.g. killing debug messages, ...)
now my question:
what's about the whole bootup code (./arch/.../boot/ ), which
is only used on kernel bootup (right?) ?
is it freed after the kernel has booted up; if not, is there
a way to do it ?
what's about the message "freeing unused kernel memory" ?
please answer me via email, because i'm not subscribed 
in this list. (too much traffic)
thanx,
ew.
