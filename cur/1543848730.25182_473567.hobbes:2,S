PROM console is just slower than anything else for whatever
reason.
Even though PROM console drives the same output, using the
native CONFIG_SERIAL_SUNHV is much faster and does not generate
the timeouts.
That's why I told the original poster to simply disable
CONFIG_PROM_CONSOLE, it should never be used.
