We class the SCHED_OTHER policy as having a single priority, which
I believe is allowed (and even makes good sense, because dynamic
and even nice priorities aren't really well defined).
That also makes our sched_yield() behaviour correct.
AFAIKS, sched_yield should only really be used by realtime
applications that know exactly what they're doing.
