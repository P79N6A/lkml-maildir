"popular/relevant" is hard to define.
E.g. if we'd go after "popular" we should only keep architectures like 
ARM and x86 and ditch architectures like ia64 and s390 that have puny 
userbases.
And how would you define "relevant"?

If your "or have the hardware in general" is meant seriously you have to
convince people that ARM must become a very high priority.
No matter whether one supports your "there's a clear prioritization" 
view or not it anyway doesn't currently work since the areas covered by 
people testing -rc kernels don't even remotely map the most popular 
hardware in the field.

kerneloops.org catches the easiest to solve bugs (there's a trace) and 
helps in getting them fixed.
That's a very good thing.
And if we get more bugs into this easy to resolve state that would be 
even better.
But it's only a small part of the complete picture of incoming bug 
reports.
