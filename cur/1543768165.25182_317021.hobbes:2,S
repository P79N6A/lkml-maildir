Hi,
I am using 2.6.11.4 source.
I am compiling linux kernel with source
and objects are in different directory. (Using O= options)
I have an external module in different directory .
I can compile this external module without a problem.  
But objects/modules are placed into same directory as source.
Is there any way to put external modules objects/modules
into different directory? 
Thanks
Ajay
