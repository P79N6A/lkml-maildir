The former: a filesystem test harness in userspace, possibly with some
kernel code changes to make it easier to integrate it with the
userspace test harness.  It's very similar to what the Netfilter folks
did, and it has the advantage that we can do testing much more
quickly, especially in cases where we want to simulate crashes at
certain specific test points to make sure the journal recovery happens
correctly.
