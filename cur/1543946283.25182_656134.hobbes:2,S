Most! But not the SM50x. I still hope I would be wrong here. :-(

That's not an issue in my case. The SM50x can be connected to
either an PCI or some Local/CPU-whateverbus IF.
I.e. on the MPC85xx PowerPC, PCI and LocalBus are separate bussses.
If the sm501 is attached to the MPC85xx' PCI like any other video card,
the PCI config-space is can be accessed as usual, whereas the framebuffer
memory area is byte-swapped compared to other common video cards.
So, to get back on topic:
I would welcome endianess swapping in SW. Some architectures (PowerPC)
should also be able to do swapped-endian mmapping. I just haven't
had time for a closer look but it looks also interesting way to do it
that way.
