Actually: this only applies to operations which _both_ modify their atomic_t
operand and return a value. Eg. atomic_read() does not have barrier semantics.

I believe all the bitops are essentially the same as the atomic semantics.
That is, if they change their operand and return something, they are full
barriers both ways.
atomic_ops.txt says of them:
   "These routines, like the atomic_t counter operations returning values,
    require explicit memory barrier semantics around their execution."
I think we'd have problems at least with TestSetPageLocked if this were
not the case.
I'm not sure if I like the words imply, explicit, implicit, etc. They're
a bit confusing. provide, semantics may be better?

In particular, when clearing a bit to signal the end of a critical section,
clear_bit must be preceeded by smp_mb__before_clear_bit();
