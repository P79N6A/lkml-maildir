I have been writing a scsi module and as part of the module 
initialisation I would like to delay while waiting for a specific 
condition. I have tried to put the detect routine in a loop which 
spins on jiffies + a timeout and my hardware condition. I had all 
sorts of problems with this code and I found that module load 
locked up. I tried using barrier and schedule in this loop and found 
that schedule worked for me most of the time. 
I thought I would have a look at the code with kgdb. Firstly I noticed 
that schedule is not defined in the kgdb enabled kernel. Also even 
if I put this detect routine in a spin for a while my interrupts do not 
get serviced until after this spin and quite possibly not until the 
detect routine returns.
I would like to know the correct way to facilitate a delay in a scsi 
module detect routine, while waiting for a hardware condition which 
gets satisfied by a number of interrupts. If this condition is not met 
in a timeout period the code also continue.
I would also like to understand the kgdb kernel behaviour.
I am running a 2.4.16 kernel.
Cheers 
Simon.
