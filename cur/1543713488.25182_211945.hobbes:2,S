indeed, automatic creation of the device files is not yet incorporated under 
udev, but at least it then reverts back to the oldstyle (mknod) device file 
system, right? That's a work in progress as my systems don't actually use 
udev just yet.

hmm, really? thanks for the tip. I basically looked at O'Reilly's book when I 
coded that. Do you have a quick alternative for me to use?

perhaps some of this code (when cleaned up) can serve as a guide. I was 
actually wondering when a 2.7 release was scheduled.
Thanks for taking the time to look at the code,
