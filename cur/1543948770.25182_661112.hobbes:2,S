I can see how it's being used just fine, thank you.
If you only want this interface for SELinux put it in
SELinux. Don't clutter up the LSM with it. If it's an
LSM interface it should be potentially useful for any
and all LSMs, be they label based or not, MAC or DAC.
Even within a label based MAC scheme it may not be
sensible, given that a MAC scheme could use multiple
xattrs (e.g. a B&L sensitivity label and a Biba integrity
label) to store its blob.
If what you want in LSM terms is a name to give the blob
make your interface be security_blob_name(). The LSM can
deal with this as it sees fit, and NFS can determine if
it's a blob that it wants to deal with independently.
Such an interface could even support stacking should
that ever come about.
LSM is not supposed to be only for MAC and it's not supposed
to be only for label based schemes. It's supposed to be
for additional security restrictions. Providing an interface
that should be generally applicable with a name that
constrains it to a specific subset of those schemes is wrong.
