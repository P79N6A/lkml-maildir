Great. And it still is not following the standard. The standard tells
nothing about PCI, MMIO or whatever. volatile is _NOT_ about
serialization.

1. The volatile implementation of gcc is correct. The standard does not
talk about busses, not even about SMP.
2. Who is going to define what normal hardware is and what not ?
A committee perhaps, that would at least guarantee that this feature is
never implemented.

What a great idea! I can imagine the necessary framework, where you need
to register the address spaces and related access functions and make
every access to such variables burn thousands of CPU cycles.
Again: The only thing volatile guarantees is that is does not optimize
seemingly static variables. It reads back from memory. Nothing else.
It's a punctual disabling of optimizations. And this is not something
restricted to gcc. There are _NO_ compilers which solve something else
than this.
There is no reasonable automated solution for this problem, otherwise
the compiler geeks would have implemented the
--coded_with_brain_disabled option already.
