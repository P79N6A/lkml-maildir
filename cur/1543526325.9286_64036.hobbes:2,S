It amazes me how all you hard working kernel developers took time to help
a nobody like me out.  I appreciate all the help and hopefully I will be
able to fix up my system or at least get it to limp for a few months till
I can buy a athlon.
I apolgise for my lack of netiquite but I have not used mailing lists in
yrs and am kinda rusty.
THANKS A MILLION!!!!!!!!
