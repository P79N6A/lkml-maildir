Yes, dm-crypt-mounted-jfs.
So if I understood everything correctly, a simple umount() without
a sync() before should be enough?
If so, I'll try that, I am happy about every less function call
I need to do.
Nico
P.S.: Helge, nice hint for debugging, cat'ing /proc/mounts before
      reboot/power-off/etc.!
