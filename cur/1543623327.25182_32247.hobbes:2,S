I am working on a preliminary patch that does this.  My current
implementaion (which is not ready to submit-- but works) added a line to
sys_unlink in fs/namei.c that calls my vfs_undel_link().  The
vfs_undel_link() function is based on the logic of sys_link, and creates
a hard link from the deleted file to one in the "stuff we deleted"
directory.  Then vfs_undel_link returns to sys_unlink and original link
is deleted, leaving only the one in the "stuff we deleted" directory.

After much consideration, my implementation does not deal with
truncate/overwrite because it would fill up the filesystem and be very
slow in VFS since there would have to be a full copy.  Also, staying
high level in VFS makes the patch work over any fs that uses VFS.
When I submit, I will make sure to add RFC to get more input on the
implementation, and possibly dealing with truncate.
