Roman, please do me a favor, and ask me the following question:
 " Ingo, you've been maintaining the scheduler for years. In fact you 
   wrote the old nice code we are talking about here. You changed it a
   number of times since then. So you really know what's going on here. 
   Why does the old nice code behave like that for nice +19 levels? "
I've been waiting for that obvious question, and i _might_ be able to 
answer it, but somehow it never occured to you ;-) Thanks,
	Ingo
