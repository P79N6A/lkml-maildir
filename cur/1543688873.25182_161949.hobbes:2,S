So if I have 1000 low priority tasks and one high priority task, all CPU 
bound, the high priority task gets 0.1% CPU.  This is not the desirable or 
expected behaviour.
My conclusion is, the strategy of expiring the whole active array before any 
expired tasks are allowed to run again is incorrect.  Instead, each active 
list should be refreshed from the expired list individually.  This does not 
affect the desirable O(1) scheduling property.  To prevent low priority 
starvation, the high-to-low scan should be elaborated to skip some runnable, 
high priority tasks occasionally in a *controlled* way.
IMHO, this minor change will provide a more solid, predictable base for Con 
and Nick's dynamic priority and dynamic timeslice experiments.

Daniel
