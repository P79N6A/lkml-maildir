As I saw the thread today, I started looking at it myself, on RH's
 2.4.18-18.8.0. By now I have:
 1  0  0 432892  23828  44648 407208   0   0     0    24  780   879  95   5   0
         ======
However, top says:
  PID USER     PRI  NI  SIZE  RSS SHARE STAT %CPU %MEM   TIME COMMAND
 1450 dmitri    15   0  546M 178M 16212 S     1.1 23.6  21:50 pan
I close pan, and what a change!
 3  0  0 432664  20720  44748 410260  88   0   392    20  710   925  95   4   1
 1  0  0  46316 197172  44760 409684  40   0    40   160  782  1177  88  12   0
So you probably still have some process which is eating your memory. And
once you find it, restart it:
  PID USER     PRI  NI  SIZE  RSS SHARE STAT %CPU %MEM   TIME COMMAND
