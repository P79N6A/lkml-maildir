I think it's the cleanest way to have different startup code for
native and non-native in the same kernel.  But even if that's not
needed (for Linux), then you can have it point at the same address.
It is also always pointing to a virtual address, while the elf header
one now points to a physical address which doesn't make much sense
in the environment we start the kernel.
