So we are in a desperate situation, we can almost make no progress, adding 
another task is going to push the system into an unrecoverable situation, 
and we make sure this task can be started.-)

That never happened on my servers, therefore I'd opt for the little extra 
security of having spare 4k on the stack. (I made a patch which would 
printk a message if allocating a stack would ever fail).
I'm not at all opposed to letting the guys with zillions of threads 
benefit from having less unused kernel stack, but unless it's secure for
all users, it should not be default=y.
