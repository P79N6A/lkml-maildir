Neat!  I saw Manfred posted this driver for 2.6.x, as well.  I'm glad 
soembody FINALLY got around to supporting this chipset under Linux.
Anyway, even with an alpha-quality driver, it's a driver that works 
where otherwise the kernel doesn't.  So, after I review the driver, I 
would prefer to merge it soon rather than later.  It gets users going, 
after all.
Has nVidia yelled yet?  Since it's cleanroom, according to you, I don't 
see any problems at all...
