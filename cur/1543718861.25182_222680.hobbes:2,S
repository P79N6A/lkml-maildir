The generic_make_request() change itself is fine, as long as the proper
error is propagated back. I don't object to that at all, and I outlined
that to Phil last week as well. So in short:
        if (bio_data_dir(bio) == WRITE && bdev_read_only(bio->bi_bdev)) {
                bio_endio(bio, bio->bi_size, -EROFS);
                break;
        }
If you want to pass back 0 instead, then that would be a one-liner in
your (private) debugging patch. Ok?

I don't think this change makes sense as written for the generic
kernels, not if you want to simply ignore the write. If that is the
case, it's a special case debug entry for a very narrow use (ie lustre).
