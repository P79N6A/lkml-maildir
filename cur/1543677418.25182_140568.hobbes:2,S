man symlink

       The permissions of a symbolic  link  are  irrelevant;  the
       ownership  is  ignored  when  following  the  link, but is
       checked when removal or renaming of the link is  requested
       and the link is in a directory with the sticky bit set.
In short, the permissions of the file being linked to are important.
