Odd; I have a UP IO-APIC ia32 box here and it appears to do okay; there
is a question of sparse APIC ID's and APIC ID space needing to be
independent of NR_CPUS handled in the ia32 code that isn't handled in
the x86_64 code. It was handled for ia32 by using a bitmap of size
MAX_APICS (physid_mask_t) instead of cpumask_t for the things, which
appears to eliminate various special cases for xAPIC's too.
