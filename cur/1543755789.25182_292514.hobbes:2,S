It seems to be stable, although I must admit I haven't run it on battery power
for longer than 5 min. without cpufreq and now I'm a bit reluctant to try. ;-)
Anyway the failing case seems to be when the frequency during suspend
is higher than during resume (eg when the image is created at 1800 MHz and the
CPU is running at 800 MHz right after restoring the image).
Greets,
Rafael
