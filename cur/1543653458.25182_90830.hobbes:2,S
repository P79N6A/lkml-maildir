#ifdef NEW_THREAD_EXIT
	struct completion quit;
#else
	struct semaphore quit;
#endif
In the kernel thread, someplace it can be awakened by a signal:
#ifdef NEW_THREAD_EXIT
	complete_and_exit(&quit, 0);
#else
        up_and_exit(&quit, 0);
#endif
In cleanup_module:
#ifdef NEW_THREAD_EXIT
	wait_for_completion(&quit);
#else
	down(&quit);
#endif
You define NEW_THREAD_EXIT based upon the kernel version. 2.4.18
uses the new syntax.
If you have a lot of threads, you need to have one of these constructs
for each of the threads and don't forget to initialize the semaphores.
Last I knew, this was the way to do it (and it works).
Cheers,
