Subject: Optimisation for smp_num_cpus loop in hotplug

The hotplug CPU patch introduces this to replace the loop over all active CPUs 
abstraction:
	for (i = 0; i < NR_CPUS; i++) {
		if (!cpu_online(i))
			continue;
Since the cpu online map is probably going to be quite sparse, could I suggest 
this alternative, which doesn't have to loop 32 times:

        return hweight32(cpu_online_map);
I've implemented this for my voyager system (8 cpus, but still a sparse online 
bitmap), mainly because (for historical reasons), I have to do this loop in 
time critical IPI code.
