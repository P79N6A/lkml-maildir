Change of technique this time, as I found a way to work with BitKeeper
that I'm comfortable with. On the upside, syncing gets easier for me,
on the downside, I'm still experimenting, so some bits might be a bit
bumpy, with maybe 1-2 files there that shouldn't be etc..
Chances are this won't even boot for many people (if any at all).
There's something nasty in my tree right now which makes it
fail to find init(1).  I wasn't going to put up a .30-dj for this
reason until I tracked it down, but a few people asked for
something to sync against, or wanted to see where my tree currently
stood (and didn't want to use bk), so just before I disappear
for a week, I've put this up.  So consider it a 'useful only
if you plan to send dave anything' patch for now.
There's still truckloads in my pending patches folder that need
going through, but things like the init(1) problem need tracking
down before I move onto those.
Back in a week..
