Most of the domain is down right now (changing ISP). But the mail server
is up at hermes.drzeus.cx:
drzeus.cx.              86393   IN      MX      10 mail.drzeus.cx.
list.drzeus.cx.         86400   IN      MX      10 mail.drzeus.cx.
mail.drzeus.cx.         84586   IN      A       193.12.253.7
hermes.drzeus.cx.       83892   IN      A       193.12.253.7

Have you tried pinging it? For some reason the keyboard tends to bail
out when there are outstanding MMC requests. I've only seen this with a
card in the slot though.
You could increase the log level sent to console and enable MMC_DEBUG.
If you can find more closely where it hangs I have a better chance of
finding it.
