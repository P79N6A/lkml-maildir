Ok, it is good that we are seeing same behaviour.

Found it: 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/21/223.
I'll try it the next days. Do you want me to report results? [and
especially, should I Cc: Ingo Molnar on the report?]

Maybe the overhead of latencytop is triggerring other behaviour in the
scheduler? Just a guess.
Are there any tests I can run to see why there are more context switches?

Yes, I understand that. Is there a way latencytop could track its own
overhead? I suppose it would lead to more accurate results
(not that there would be anything wrong with the current ones).

Thanks, that explains it. Looks like a good substitute for the average
column.
This is the functionality I was missing, when that column went away.
Still, I wouldn't mind to see the average column too (maybe activated
via a hotkey, or shown only if enough screenspace is available?).

If I stretch my terminal window there's room for 2 or 3 more columns :)

I gathered these while writing this reply:
