I hadn't noticed immediately in the ooops, but it is something to do
with the Hardware Abstraction Layer Daemon from 
http://freedesktop.org/Software/hal
I can't reproduce it without that daemon loaded either.  I wonder if the
last accessed sysfs file mentioned in the oops (sda/size) is relevent
also.
My exact steps (with hald loaded) are:
plug in ipod
mount /mnt/ipod
unzip -d /mnt/ipod rockbox.zip
eject /dev/sda
unplug ipod
immediately here, the oops prints.
Interestingly after this happens, the system remains at a pretty high
level of functioning, and further mounts and unmounts and ejects of the
ipod do not cause another oops.
