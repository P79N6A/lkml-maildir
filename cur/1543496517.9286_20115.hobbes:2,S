    Okay, so I did that - I changed from:
        #define MAX_SWAPFILES    8
    to:
        #define MAX_SWAPFILES    32
    Now I can add up to 15 swap partitions, not 32.  I have 20 disks hanging
    off of an AS4000, with the possibility of somewhere in the area of 40
    disks by the time I'm done.  All of these disks are going to be configured
    the same - 256MB for swap, and the rest as a standard ext2 filesystem.
    Which brings me to my next point...This is a script of a session of me
    trying to mount another of the 20 disks.  The questioning comes after.

    [root@frigate /root]# df -k
    Filesystem         1024-blocks  Used Available Capacity Mounted on
    /dev/sdm2             108870   53943    49305     52%   /

Why are you showing df output?
So indirect. It uses libc routines to look at /etc/mtab,
while you are interested in the kernel.
So, use "cat /proc/mounts" to see what the kernel thinks about
the situation, and "cat /etc/mtab" to see what mount made of it so far.
I hope you didnt use a symlink /etc/mtab -> /proc/mounts.
You can debug df and libc some other time.

    Oh, and lest I forget, this is stock 2.2.8
Hmm. I have seen a lot of bad reports on 2.2.8.
