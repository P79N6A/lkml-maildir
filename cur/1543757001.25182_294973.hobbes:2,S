Do you have an HPET timer enabled?  That could cause a conflict.
Does /proc/interrupts report rtc interrupts increasing when you
run rtctest?
I.e., does the number of this line increase like this?
   8:        131    IO-APIC-edge  rtc
rtctest works for me (2.6.11-rc4).  Maybe send me the strace
output when you run rtctest and your .config file.
Oh, and your kernel boot log, maybe there are some rtc driver
messages in it.
