Subject: [patch] 2.5.41: mii breakage in xircom_tulip_cb
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I use the xircom_tulip_cb driver with 2.4.19, because it is mii-enabled,
and the new driver isn't. 
In 2.5.41 (and .40, at least) the mii-capabilities is not there, I have
not tested earlier development kernels. The changes between the driver
in 2.4.19 and 2.5.41 are miniscule, so I was able to make mii work
again (this is my first attempt at kernel hacking; don't laugh :). It's
most definately _not_ the correct fix, it is just a revert from 2.4.19
that makes mii work for me again in 2.5.
