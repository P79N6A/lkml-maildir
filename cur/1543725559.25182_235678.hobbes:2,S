Minor nit: this is not true, maybe if you are talking only about
desktop/server distros. MontaVista Linux 3.1 uses devfs by default.
However, with udev devfs compatibility it easy for that distro
to migrate users IMHO. So, let's apply this patch so mvista doesn't
ship another release with devfs. :)
