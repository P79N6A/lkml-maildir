The trully concerned should simply use true random number generators.  
Like a zenner diodes noise.
For everybody else... most if not all of what /dev/random does, just  
simply
isn't worth the trouble at all. Thus the less of it the better.
BTW. Did somebody notice that the whole disc seek time dance around / 
dev/random does,
is quite idiotic for deterministic flash drives? It will screw yours  
"randomness" silently...
