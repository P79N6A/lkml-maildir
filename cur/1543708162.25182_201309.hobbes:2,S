0x59 is the status that the drive sends when it has a block in error
and wants to transmit said block.  The LBA in the task file after the
bad block is transferred is the location of the error.
I think that the drive you're copying from had a hard ECC error.
Maybe see if you can try to read all the files on that drive and see
if you can find a bad block.
