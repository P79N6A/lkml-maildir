I'm checking on some IPVS related code "inconsistency" regarding the
latest patches sent by Julian and a netfilter reference counting issue
on SMP. Could you hold off until Sunday with the release, please. If I
don't report back by then with either a bug report or bugfix, release it ;).
Willy, if you have time, could you check your non-i386 boxes with a
2.95.x compiled 2.4.x kernel, with IPVS enabled? Also I checked back
with your hf7 series patches and I should like to note that the IPVS
related patches have been merged upstream with Marcelo for 2.4.32-rc2.
Thanks guys,
Roberto Nibali, ratz
