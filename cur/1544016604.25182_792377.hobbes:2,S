We have had ugly DMA bugs in scsi drivers but I think that this new
feature can find very few of them. I can't think of any SCSI driver
bugs that this could find. This feature can't find any popular DMA
bugs in scsi drivers, such as messing up driver's dma descriptor from
a scatter gather list.
But this can find some kinds of DMA bugs and it's is just about 1,000
lines. I don't see any problem about merging this. 1,000 lines it too
large? Maybe cutting just 1,000 lines up into too many pieces is
deceptive.
