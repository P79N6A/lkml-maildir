What I don't understand is why we can't just put an option in the Linux
config to enable 64-bit block support, as we have with the High Memory
Support option.  That way the user could select that option if they want it,
regardless of the processor they are using.  Jens Axboe <axboe@suse.de>
already mentioned he had patched the kernel to do someting similar earlier
this month on a similar thread on linux-kernel.
It makes sense to have this option when we have an enterprise level LVM
and 64-bit file systems such as the Global File System (GFS) for Linux.
