that would be enough if you could ask any capability to those apps.
Still you could override the sysctl check and allow the
mmap(VM_NONLINEAR) to work even w/ the sysctl, iff CAP_IPC_LOCK is set,
that's certainly safe, I don't mind about it.
so it could be an additional way to gain access to such functionalty,
but it doesn't obviate the need of the sysctl IMHO.
