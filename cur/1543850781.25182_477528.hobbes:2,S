Hi,
the user-space command "ipcs" seems somewhat broken on my 2.6.18.1 as
it doesn't output anything, uses 100% CPU and isn't kill'able.
strace'ing it shows nothing/simply blocks.
Distro is CentOS 4.4, Kernel 2.6.18.1 x86 SMP, gcc version 3.4.6
20060404 (Red Hat 3.4.6-3).
Google didn't turn up anything. Any suggestions to track that down?
Cheers,
M
