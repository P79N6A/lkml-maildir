OK, I added the matching pipe_kunmap variants.  Now that we have the
matching pair, I made further optimization to make both pipe_kmap and
pipe_kmap_atomic the same because pipe_kmap does not hold any critical
resource that can't sleep.  There is no reason to make them different.
Full patch and changelog:
It is really sad that we always call kmap and friends for every pipe
buffer page on 64-bit arch that doesn't use HIGHMEM, or on
configuration that doesn't turn on HIGHMEM.
The effect of calling kmap* is visible in the execution profile when
pipe code is being stressed.  It is especially true on amd's x86-64
platform where kmap() has to traverse through numa node index
calculation in order to convert struct page * to kernel virtual
address.  It is fairly pointless to perform that calculation repeatly
on system with no highmem (i.e., 64-bit arch like x86-64).  This patch
caches kernel pipe buffer page's kernel vaddr to speed up pipe buffer
mapping functions.
There is another suboptimal block in pipe_read() where wake_up is
called twice.  I think it was an oversight since in pipe_write(), it
looks like it is doing the right thing.
