WHY ? I'm had such things for few years with Linux 2.0.x without ill effects !

Why ????

YOU said that there are some restrictions :-) YOU should show me RFC where such
restrictions are enfoced.
Class C and such things are not relevant to interface configuration at all.
It's perfectly legal to have ip 168.1.1.1 netmask 255.73.209.101 with
broadcast 168.183.47.155. Yes, some route advertising protocols could not
handle such weirdness but linux kernel handle it just fine. I'm tested this
three years ago and Linux was happy with this -- where you find idea that
"subnet mask must be at least 255.255.255.0 or 24 bits" and other strange
ideas ? NOT from route advertising protocols viewpoint, of course !
