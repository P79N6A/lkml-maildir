Greetings,
In patch 2.3.27, there is the following modification in Space.c (with
many others):
 static struct net_device eth0_dev = {
-    "eth0" __PAD4, 0, 0, 0, 0, ETH0_ADDR, ETH0_IRQ, 0, 0, 0, &eth1_dev,
ethif_probe };
+    "eth%d" __PAD5, 0, 0, 0, 0, ETH0_ADDR, ETH0_IRQ, 0, 0, 0,
&eth1_dev, ethif_probe };
Basically many occurences (not all) of interface names are replaced with
format strings.
But it seems odd to me :
- Some interface names aren't modified,
- there is no code that actually sprintfs the right number in the format
strings,
- It break my command line parameters : ether=0,1,2,3,eth0 -> it tries
to compare 'eth0' with 'eth%d' in  net/ethernet/eth.c eth_setup(), and
it fails.
May be I didn't understand the aim of that patch.
Anybody can help me ? (private mail please, I do not read the full
list.)
Thanx.
