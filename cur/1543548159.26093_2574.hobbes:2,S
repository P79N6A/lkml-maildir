Nah, choose new words which stand out. There are plenty of them and
it avoids the problem of a 0xdeadb001 being decremented before being
noticed and thus confused with a 0xdeadb000. Be inventive:
    egrep -x '[abcdefilos]{3,8}' /usr/dict/words
and make one up whenever needed. For example,
    0baff1ed
    acce55ed
    decea5ed
    d15ab1ed
    d15ea5ed
along with multiword ones like
    fee1dead
    dead1055
    badca5e5
