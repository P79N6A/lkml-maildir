Sparc64's alias'able caches are 1) write-through and 2) quite small.
I think I begin to see the issue clearly now.
But you cannot do the VM_SHARED change without an audit first.
Lots of code thinks that VM_SHARED means someone maybe wrote
to the page through a mmap().  For example look at how filemap
sync interprets this flag bit.
