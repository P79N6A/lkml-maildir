Well, the thing is, we throttle pageout in throttle_vm_writeout(). As it
stand we can deadlock there because it just waits for the numbers to
drop, and unstable pages don't automagically dissapear. Only
write_inodes() - normally called from balance_dirty_pages() will call
COMMIT.
So my thought was that calling pageout() on an unstable page would do
the COMMIT - we're low on memory, otherwise we would not be paging, so
getting rid of unstable pages seems to make sense to me.
