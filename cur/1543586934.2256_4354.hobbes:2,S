Hi out there,
I have a problem with my 2.4.3 kernel. I have a 650 MB MO-Disk attached to my 
computer via SCSI. Partitioning and formatting a disk works fine. However, if 
the disk is formatted with a DOS filesystem, writing something to it hangs 
the whole system. Not even the Ctrl-Alt-Del works. I have to use the reset 
key. With a ext2 filesystem writing works fine.
Please help.
Regards
Detlev
