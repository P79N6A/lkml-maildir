   the following code in tcp_v4_hnd_req looks broken:
 ...
             tcp_tw_put((struct tcp_tw_bucket*)sk);
   Shouldn't it put *nsk* instead of sk?  This appears to be the cause of
   weird crashes under heavy network load we've been experiencing ...
Indeed, you are correct and I've also made the fix for ipv6 in my tree
as it had the same exact problem.
Franks a lot,
