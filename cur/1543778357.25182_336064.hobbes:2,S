I didn't realize that echo was adding the CR, I thought that it always
appeared on the end of a sysfs attribute set. So now I have to go add
white space stripping to a dozen fbdev/drm sysfs attribute
implementations. Given that the param is const I may have to allocate
new buffers and copy. I also wonder how many other people have made
the same mistake.
Are you sure it would break other things? These are supposed to be
text attributes, not binary ones.
