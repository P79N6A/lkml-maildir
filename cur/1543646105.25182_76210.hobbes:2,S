I started beta testing 2.5.40 today, and when I tried to compile, I got 
this error message:
Menuconfig has encountered a possible error in one of the kernel's
configuration files and is unable to continue.  Here is the error
report:
 Q> ./scripts/Menuconfig: MCmenu74: command not found
Please report this to the maintainer <mec@shout.net>.  You may also
