In mathematics < is not an operation that yields a result in
the domain of integers.  So  "(a < b) - 1" is impossible.
Regardless this isn't a case where the C precedence is wrong.
"a < b | 1" is an example of C getting the precedence wrong.
Having to remember where C is wrong and in what circumstances is
harder than just putting in parenthesis.
