No, nothing. I've set up remote-syslgging to the other node (node1 
logging to node2 and vice versa) - nothing :(

Yes, when booting with 'lapic' both CPUs/cores are handling interrupts 
again. However, since 'lapic' seems to lead to crashes here, we would be 
more than happy to just boot with 'noapic' but have 'irqbalance' 
working. Unfortunately, irqbalance is unable to write to 
/proc/irq/*/smp_affinity (did not help to disable CONFIG_IRQBALANCE).

Yeah, we'll see if we still have time for trying this. But I figure this 
will not be a real (long term) option for us :(

Indeed, that's what I too wanted to do.
@Malte: any plans for another downtime?
Thanks for your comments!
Christian.
