Yeah, that's why I said the interface was simple on purpose right now.
I'm sure it's extendable for some sort of adaptive queueing as well, I
will try to provide some examples for that. cciss will eat a lot more
commands than you think, it typically has a bigger internal queue depth
than the block layer :-). If not dac960, then SCSI is a possibility.
