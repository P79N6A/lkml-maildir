I forgot to mention that I am using a 2.6.10 kernel but will try
2.6.11rc1 soon. Are you using a SMP system? I assume the cabling, card
reader and SD card are OK because the problem went away with maxcpus=1,
the problem must be in the USB ehci/ohci/storage drivers. Do you know if
there is any difference between addressing external hard disks and SD
cards?
