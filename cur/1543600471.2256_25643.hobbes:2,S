lspnp (comes with pcmcia-cs) would be more intresting.  The pnpbios code
fills a "struct pci_dev" for each device reported by the pnpbios, and it
looks like your portable has one device with alot ressources, so the
ressources array in struct pci_dev can't hold them all.  There is a
#define in include/linux/pci.h for the array size ...
