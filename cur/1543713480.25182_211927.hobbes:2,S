Andrew -- some data on the 4G/4G problems:
The following kernels with 4G/4G enabled would hang my box about once every 24
hours.
2.6.5-rc2-mm4   
2.6.3-mm3       
The 2.6.5-rc3-mm4 kernel with 4G/4G enabled has been much more stable (like
earlier -mmX kernels with 4G/4G enabled).
The 4G/4G patch is still useful for me -- although 64bit linux (x86_64) is the
best 'real' long-term solution to large memory jobs.
