2.4 and 2.6 handle mouse differently; 2.4 has /dev/psaux which is just a 
direct channel into the port while 2.6 inteprets all mouse stuff and 
regenerates a virtual /dev/psaux.
Try modprobing the even device (modprobe evdev) to get /dev/input/event?. Then 
run hexdump -C /dev/input/event1 (or whatever even device represents your 
mouse) to see what REALLY happens in the kernel. Don't worry about the first 
8 octets, the stuff you want is in the last 8. Might be a good idea to switch 
to a console so that extra mouse clicks won't do any strange things.

I use an Explorer at work, don't have the Buttons directive at all and my 
ZAxMap is "4 5". That way everything works, but the side buttons are missing. 
That's with 2.6.5 and Gentoo.
