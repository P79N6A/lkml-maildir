All of these pose no problem, because we know if the PCI is running at
double the nominal speed.

This one is a problem, because 41*2 != 55. However, this is also illegal
according to the PCI spec.

But yes, you convinced me that we may want to keep the clock speed per
bus (perhaps in the pci_bus struct ...), to be able to work with all the
(maybe spec noncompliant, or just weird) hardware.
Thanks.
