Yes I noticed, which means you are not getting anything bounced and that
you will need to handle highmem mapping.

The key is that you have to have interrupts disabled for the highmem
case, which may complicate your driver (or just make it perform worse,
from the system POV). If you let the block layer bounce, then you can
just use page_address() and don't worry about disabling interrupts. The
way I see it:
- Either you are using an ancient system with that drive, where you will
  never see highmem.
- Or, it's a newer system and the nerd in you likes to play with ancient
  CD-ROM drives. That box may have highmem, but it can also bounce
  memory thousands of times faster than the mitsumi drive can dish out
  the data.
IOW, you are always better off not supporting highmem for this driver.
The fact that it also simplifies the handling is a bonus.

Yeah, that is true.

Well thanks to both of you, then :-)

Fine with me... As far as I am concerned, you are now the legacy CD-ROM
driver maintainer :-)
