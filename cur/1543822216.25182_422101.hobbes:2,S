Ah yeah, I seem to have neglected to mention it's a kdump boot :} Sorry.
That's why we get the strangely aligned memory sections. The section
starting at 0 is for the kdump kernel, the bit at 0x77c0 covers some
firmware that's allocated there by the first kernel.
I can still give you a .config and log if you want it, but not 'til
tomorrow morning.

Yeah it's a bit nasty having the loop. I figure on most configs it'll
pop on the first iteration, but still.
