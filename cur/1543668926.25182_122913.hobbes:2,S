Also, part of this is prior agreement with Hugh (the originator of the
2.4.x version of the stuff) and akpm to withhold merging until full
functionality is achieved.
IMHO this full functionality has not been achieved, even though some
demonstrations of broadened hardware support benefits are feasible.
To both respect this agreement and remain within the bounds of my own
coding ethics, I should refuse to merge until both a greater degree of
completeness of implementation and a far greater degree of code
cleanliness is achieved.
