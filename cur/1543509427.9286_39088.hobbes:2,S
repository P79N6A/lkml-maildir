On a positive note, I upgraded my CPU from a K6-350 to a K6-450 and
Linux didn't even hiccup.  It correctly detected the processor and speed
(now to try that mtrr stuff) as opposed to the bios which thinks it's a
400MHz processor.  Kernel compile time went from 10:48 to 6:45.
I ran the reccommended sh linux/scripts/MAKEDEV.ide and still get the
following messages:
