That seems like a good, easy and localized change.  Ok,
I will see if how it looks after I try to code it.

My mask patch does this.

That boils down to a very straightforward question.  Do we ask
them to write:
	cpus_or(s.bits, d1.bits, d2.bits)
or:
	bitmap_or(s.bits, d1.bits, d2.bits, NR_CPUS);
I prefer the first choice.  It requires a thin cpumask.h header
to wrap the bitmap ops, and add the final NR_CPUS to each one.
I believe the 2nd choice introduces one more way to screw up,
by specifying the wrong bitsize.  I've got enough such ways
already - don't need more.
