OK.  What's the right way to fix this, then?
Here are a few alternate ideas off the top of my head:
* Rip out Linuxthreads, replace it with NGPT, and
start fixing from there?  (Or does NGPT already fix this?)
* Rewrite Linux's setitimer(ITIMER_PROF,...) to set up an 
interval timer for all threads of the thread group.
* Implement the profil() system call from Solaris
(

What's your favorite idea for getting profiling of
multithreaded programs working on Linux?
Thanks,
Dan
