I first thought that 2.4.19-pre5 would be better than 2.4.18 because
vmstat showed that 2.4.19-pre5 could still read 1-2 MB per second from
HDD while writing to DVD-RAM, whereas 2.4.18 blocked totally for more
than 10 seconds or so. But there are short moments under both kernels
(with default bdflush parameters) where you get data from HDD at a
very high rate before it drops again. It seems the main throughput
over a long time stems from these short moments.

That's why I did the benchmarks in the first place, because my desktop
was unresponsive while writing to DVD-RAM.
