I experienced constant and reproducable data corruption on two via
motherboards.  One using 686 and one 686b.  However, not with the IDe
drives.  This was with a DDS4 scsi tape drive attached to either a
Adaptec or Advansys scsi controller.  A 2.5G file dump to tape would
never restore the same.  One the Adaptec card, I would get 1 or 2
blocks of 64bytes that would differ.  On the Advansys it would be 1 or
2 blocks of 63 bytes.
Switch to a PIII-500 on a BX motherboard and have had no problems.
The VIA motherboards are now in windows machines where the flakiness
of the OS is even worse than the hardware.
