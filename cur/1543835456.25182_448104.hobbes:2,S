Would it be better to have a name variable directly in isa_device and
then copy that to driver in isa_register_device (like
pci_register_device does)?
I was trying to look for use examples of this code in 2.6.18-rc2 but
didn't see any.  Is the intent of name to be the cards address, and
ndev to be the function on a specific card?  Would it be better to
seperate name from the thing that ends up in bus_id?
I only ask as was looking to use something similiar to other code
I've seen in kernel in that it seemed the bus_type + bus_id would
uniquely identify a particular card that would pretty much persist
(on removal/addition of hardware?).  When a legacy isa device was
found by this code they switched to mangling an id from the cards
address.
I think between that and a probe test you could make pretty sure
you had exactly the same card.  Am wondering if this code allowed
for something similiar, in that bus_type + bus_id could be stored
and used later to locate the same card.
Regards,
Simon
