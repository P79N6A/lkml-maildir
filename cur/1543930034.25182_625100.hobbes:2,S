I don't see that he is proposing to change the interface, just how it 
gets the data it provides. Any program which depends on the actual data 
values it gets from urandom is pretty broken, anyway. I think that 
getting some entropy from network is a good thing, even if it's used 
only in urandom, and I would like a rational discussion of checking the 
random pool available when urandom is about to get random data, and 
perhaps having a lower and upper bound for pool size.
That is, if there is more than Nmax random data urandom would take some, 
if there was less than Nmin it wouldn't, and between them it would take 
data, but less often. This would improve the urandom quality in the best 
case, and protect against depleting the /dev/random entropy in low 
entropy systems. Where's the downside?
There has also been a lot of discussion over the years about improving 
the quality of urandom data, I don't personally think making the quality 
higher constitutes "changing a 12 years old and widely used userspace 
interface like /dev/urandom" either.
Sounds like a local DoS attack point to me...
