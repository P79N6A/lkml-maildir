Even simpler case: LCD backlight can come in many flavors, both in terms
of brightness levels and fixed amount of current required to keep it ON.
Trying to abstract such details from the decision-making makes little
sense.
Isolating that into a separate module, instead, brings the best of both
worlds:
-containment of the HW-specific code
-leveraging every possible, no matter how exotic, power saving mode
available.
