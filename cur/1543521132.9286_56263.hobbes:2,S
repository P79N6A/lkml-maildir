Hello,
I'm running on an Abit BE6 motherboard with an integrated HPT366 IDE controller.  I've checked hedrick's people directory in the kernel.org mirrors and it appears that there is not yet an IDE patch for 2.2.14, and the latest 2.2.14pre patch seems to not be compatible.  Is this patch in the works?
Also, I was wondering if this patch was slated for permanent inclusion in the kernel.  I think I read something about it included in 2.3.x right now, but I could be mistaken.
Thanks,
Warren Togami
