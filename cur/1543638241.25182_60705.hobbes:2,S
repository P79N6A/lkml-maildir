OK, but if it is only supposed to emulate an 8086 shouldn't it have
trapped on every instruction not existing on 8086? It doesn't and
that is quite fortunate, because we can then use it for other purposes
namely runing software that expects to have the entire computer for
itself in a multitasking environment. However it seems no matter how
we do it, what is emulated will not work exactly like any CPU in real
mode.

That does make some sense, but not all software written for i386 and
later processors does deal with vm86 in the desired way. Some software
was only intended for real mode when being written, but we might now
want to run it in virtual 86 mode. Thanks to emm386 we probably don't
see many DOS programs not working in virtual 86 mode, but emm386 itself
plain refuses to load in virtual 86 mode.
