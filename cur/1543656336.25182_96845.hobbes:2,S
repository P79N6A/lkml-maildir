Ha!  I believe you, having followed LKML for the past several months.  I
greatly appreciate all of the work you have done both on cleaning stuff up
structurally and on getting things to work.  I know just how much work that
is, having done it myself on smaller projects where I work.  (I imagine
that Motorola 68k family boards are rather easier to debug than the latest
and greatest Intel-type platform, however!  I've never had to deal with
BIOS or APIC or IRQ routing of any sort or .... well, you get the drift.
This is why I appreciate how much work and time you put into this.)
I'll play around with a bunch of 2.4 kernels from www.kernel.org to see if
I can find a place where it stopped working.  It's possible though that
none of them will work because the working kernel is a Red Hat 8.0 one with
its (unknown to me only because I haven't investigated it) collection of
patches.  I'll do the experiment and let you know tomorrow if I can find a
"it worked here but stopped working here" point.  If I get the time I'll
also try out the latest 2.5 series...
      Thanks
      Eddie
P.S.  Andre, I assumed you would not want or need to be CC'd.  I hope that
is the correct assumption.  :)
