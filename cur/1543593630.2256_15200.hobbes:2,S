Hi all!
The problem is solved, if I disconnect the hp streamer
from the bus. I wonder why there is a problem.
The aic7880 has two busses:
ultra/ ultrawide.
The ibm hard disk is connected to the uw port and is terminated.
No other uw device is attached.
The hp streamer is also lonely on the ultra bus. I have
no documentation for that device, so I don't know
whether it is terminated nor if it is using parity.
Btw, can somebody explain what the parity bit does to me ?
Or does anybody have a hp c1536 streamer and can help me ?
Regards,
Nico
