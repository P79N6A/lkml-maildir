That's how it works. It's by design. The RTC is where the trace events are 
stored, since that's the only piece of hw that reliably survives a reboot.
The help-text says:
        This enables some cheesy code to save the last PM event point in the
        RTC across reboots, so that you can debug a machine that just hangs
        during suspend (or more commonly, during resume).
Heh.
