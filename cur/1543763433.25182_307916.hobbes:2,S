keventd does very hard jobs on some of my test machines which 
for example route big amount of traffic.

I experimented with several usage cases for CBUS and it was proven 
to be the fastest case when only one sending thread exists which manages
only very limited amount of messages at a time [like 10 in CBUS
currently]
without direct awakening [that is why wake_up() is commented in
cbus_insert()].
If too many deferred insert works will be called simultaneously
[which may happen with keventd] it will slow down insert operations
noticeably.
I did not try that case with the keventd but with one kernel thread 
it was tested and showed worse performance.
