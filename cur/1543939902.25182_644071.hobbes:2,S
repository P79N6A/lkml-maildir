Thanks for this respone. This confirms that cpu's idle time is close to
zero, as I intended to verify.

On further examination, ondemand governor seems to have a tunable to
ignore nice load. In your case, I see that dnetc is running at a
positive nice value (19) which could explain why ondemand gov thinks
that the cpu is only ~50% loaded.
Can you check what is the setting of this knob in your case?
# cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/ondemand/ignore_nice_load
You can set that to 0 to ask ondemand gov to include nice load into
account while calculating cpu freq changes:
# echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/ondemand/ignore_nice_load
This should restore the behavior of ondemand governor as seen in 2.6.23
in your case (even with CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED enabled). Can you pls confirm 
if that happens?

I understand, but we want to keep CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED enabled by
default.
Ingo,
	Most folks seem to be used to a global nice-domain, where a nice 19 
task gives up cpu in competetion to a nice-0 task (irrespective of which 
userid's they belong to). CONFIG_FAIR_USER_SCHED brings noticeable changes wrt 
that. We could possibly let it be as it is (since that is what a server
admin may possibly want when managing university servers) or modify it to be 
aware of nice-level (priority of user-sched entity is equivalent to highest 
prio task it has).
In any case, I will send across a patch to turn off CONFIG_FAIR_USER_SCHED by 
default (and instead turn on CONFIG_FAIR_CGROUP_SCHED by default).
