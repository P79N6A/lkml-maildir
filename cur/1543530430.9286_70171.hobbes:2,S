One problem: either (a) the code never writes to the text pages anyway, so
you gain nothing (the promise could never have been broken anyway) OR (b)
this change breaks the code totally, because it DOES write to the text
pages.
The only circumstance under which this change would have any effect is
where the kernel's "promise" is put to the test. With the current
behaviour, the promise COULD be broken. With your suggestion implemented,
it GUARANTEES that the problem occurs.
So other than turning the remote possibility of a problem into a
guaranteed problem, the change achieves nothing. I don't think it'll make
it into the tree, then :-)
James.
