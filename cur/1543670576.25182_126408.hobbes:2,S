I had the same situation with some cheap mobo (ECS K7S5A+) of friend of 
mine. You don't need to check md5sums. Why is MD5 better than any other 
method? I just simply found, that when I copy file A to B, and then A to 
C, it is possible that B and C differs. Most of the time with one byte.
The advice is to use some good memory test suite from time to time - it 
will do better its job than you just checking signatures on large files.

Leonard
