2.95 and previous.  In 2.96 somewhere we fixed a bug that
automatically prototypes these builtin functions for you;
ie with current code you get an undeclared function warning.

Yes.  The thing about abs, though, is that it's "int abs(int)"
which does naughty things with longs on 64-bit targets.  You're
much better off writing (x < 0 ? -x : x) directly.
