If you as an individual use the term "GNU/Linux" for the operating
system that's the combination of Linux and GNU, you won't change what
"the world calls" the system.  But "the world" doesn't really do
anything; individuals do.  You can't change the whole world by
yourself, but you can change part of it.
Each person who decides to use the name "GNU/Linux" helps to spread
the word about where the operating system as a whole came from, and
also helps users understand the difference between the whole system
and the kernel.  You can help inform hundreds of people by typing 4
extra characters, a few times a day.  It is hard to find a more
efficient use of your time.
You will also help inform the users that the system exists because of
a group of people who stood up for a principle of freedom, people who
insisted that freedom should apply to the whole of the system, and no
less.
In a time when most of the voices heard in the community say we should
sacrifice principles when they become inconvenient, it's important for
users to know that their system did not come from that approach.
Users should know that a firm stand accomplished something that
"pragmatic flexibility" would never have done.
I hope you will join me and the others who use the term "GNU/Linux".
