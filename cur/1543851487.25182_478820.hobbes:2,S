Andrew-
	This is a patch to clean up several code points in which the return code
from misc_register is not handled properly.  Several modules failed to
deregister various hooks when misc_register fails, and this patch cleans them
up.  Also there are a few modules that legitimately don't care about the failure
status of misc register.  These drivers however unilaterally call
misc_deregister on module unload.  Since misc_register doesn't initialize the
list_head in the init_routine if it fails, the deregister operation is at risk
for oopsing when list_del is called.  The initial solution was to manually init
the list in the miscdev structure in each of those modules, but the consensus in
this thread was to consolodate and do that universally inside misc_register.
Thanks & Regards
Neil
