So you rather crash than running in that unmeasurably lower performance?
IIRC those 2MB/4MB pages performance "gain" is still present (in my patch)
even if the kernel location is not 2MB/4MB aligned because the i386 2MB/4MB
pagetable entries can have arbitrary physical memory target address.
But maybe I lie here, sorry, I really do not remember it much.
(It 100% worked with the "full performance" if aligned and it "worked" if
unaligned but I do not remember if it worked "full performance" if unaligned.)

Yes, it should be fixed there so that the stacks get allocated 8KB-aligned not
depending on the kernel code position at all.  That means allocating the
initial stack by code and not relying on its autoallocation by the linker.
There would remain the 4KB alignment requirement due to the physical target
address of the pagetable entries.

Yes, it has the same unusability as CVS, just it looses the feature of being
the standard.  I assume some CVS flamewar already occured some time ago.
