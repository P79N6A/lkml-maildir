The user-mode port of 2.4.0-test9 is available.
The bug that caused bash to occasionally segfault on address 0 was fixed.
I also went on a breakpoint-fixing binge.  The problems caused by the kernel 
debugger hitting breakpoints are fixed.  Also, gdb no longer panics the kernel 
when it hits a breakpoint.  Both the kernel debugger and gdb now seem to work 
well.
Bill Stearns produced a number of new bootable filesystems, including Red Hat 
7.0, Mandrake 7.1, and Immunix 6.2.  These are available from the project's 
download page.
