I have a pseudo fs to support special files constructed and
returned as the result of certain operations in the module.
This is very very similar to what e.g. pipefs does, so the
fs implementation is closely modelled after fs/pipe.c. And
since pipefs, futexes, and a number of other pseudo fs:s in
the kernel all use get_sb_pseudo() in their ->get_sb method,
I figured I should do the same.
