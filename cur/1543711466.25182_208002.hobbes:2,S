Yes, in theory. What is done now is for sure a mistake, however I'm
thinking it's probably safer to just delete the check and setting of
segments, and do it on-demand the next time (if ever) someone calls
bio_*_segments(bio). Hmm, should be done every time someone assigns
->bi_bdev(), maybe it would be a good idea to add something like that.
static inline void bio_set_bdev(struct bio *bio, struct block_device *bdev)
{
	bio->bi_bdev = bdev;
	bio->bi_flags &= ~(1 << BIO_SEG_VALID);
}
