Ahh, but if you use initrd you can even have the ide and scsi drivers as
modules. 
What is needed is to make the disk modules depend on the raid modules (only
if the raid code is enabled of course) so that modprobe can load the raid
modules first. 
Then you'd just need to make sure that if there are any block modules linked
into the kernel that raid is also linked into the kernle instead of a module.
Is there some reason why this wouldn't work (except for CML1
complications...)?
Kieth, will kbuild2.5 affect this in any way?  Or is this entirely a CML2
thing?
