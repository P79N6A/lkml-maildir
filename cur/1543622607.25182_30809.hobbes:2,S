Help! Using 2.4.18 (and verified as far back as .9) - I am getting a process freeze when an application does an fsync. The MagicSysrq sync never completes, so I am unsure as to whether this is a deadlock or not. Dual PIII, I2O RAID controller, 2 GB MEM, ext2 filesystem. The problem is reproducible. I am going to try single CPU with no HIGHMEM. 
Any advice would be greatly appreciate. Please CC to nkirsch@insynq.com. 
Thanks!
