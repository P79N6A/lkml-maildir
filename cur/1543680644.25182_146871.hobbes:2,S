Looking through the linux-aio archives, it seems I  was confusing 
io_queue_run() with io_queue_init() and io_queue_release(), which Ben 
LaHaise reports as being used by Oracle.  In any case, I have no 
objection to removing io_queue_run() or io_queue_wait().  But then I 
don't maintain the library.
