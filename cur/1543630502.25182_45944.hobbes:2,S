Cool, thanks ;-)  Now watch me blow all my cred with this post:

Why will this help?  The hardware can still be doing DMA on hda while
the queue's request_fn is called quite legitimately for a hdb request -
and the IDE code MUST impose the serialization here to avoid hitting the
cable with commands destined for hdb. (For example, by waiting for
!channel->busy.)

I just can't see a way for the block level to remove the need for the
busy flag.  I _think_ Alan just agreed with me.  I'm not sure but I get
the impression that you are saying the IDE code doesn't need to do this
serialization...
I'm certainly learning, thanks guys.
