Hello,
patch: "kbuild-external-module-support" ?
brakes nicely my nVidia driver for installation at stage 2. Happy easter 
gift. No setting of KBUILD_EXTMOD or editing the install script helps, 
nice job.
Sorry to say this, but I do not believe, that we get more support, if the 
Linux kernel breaks with every version all good drivers, also 
closed-source, but the best, fastest and stable 3D drivers you can get at 
this time. I hope it goes not in the stable line so soon.
Marcus
