Requestors and anyone with an account can add a list to 'cc' field,
so updates will get to the list. As for gatewaying from lists to
Bugzilla, I _strongly_ oppose it, and I hope DaveM would support me.
It's a door for spam and nothing else. If you have no IP connectivity
and read your linux-kernel with FIDO gateway and GoldED, use normal
ways of cooperating with maintainers. Bugzilla is complimentary,
not mandatory.
