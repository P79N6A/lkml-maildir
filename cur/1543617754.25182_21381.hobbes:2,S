Hi to all,
fist... Sorry but my english is really bad. 
I'm not a developer (I was it) so my advice may be not useful.
I'm windering about why you haven't a simly web interface in order to submit
the patch. This solution should solve the problem related to how to poste
the patch and should e very easy to obtain a sort of repository of the patches.
I'm not a subscriber of the list, please CC me if you want to reply this
mail.
Just my 2 euro-ct...
Regards,
Ciak
