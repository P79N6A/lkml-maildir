Well, I don't think it matters in this case, since inode allocation is
not part of processing I/O, so no deadlock is possible.  See also
alloc_inode() in fs/inode.c which also uses SLAB_KERNEL.

Same reason as above.
In actual fact the whole GFP_NOFS argument doesn't apply to FUSE
_at_all_, since dirty pages are never allowed.  Which is because
userspace can't easily be taught about GFP_NOFS allocations, and
otherwise could deadlock on page writeback.
