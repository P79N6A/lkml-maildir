 Well, SIG_IGN is non-default (user-specified) behavior -- SIG_DFL is.

 Making a special exception to well-defined semantics because it seems
less useful for a certain case is policy.  SIG_IGN means to ignore a
signal (except from SIGKILL, SIGSTOP, SIGCONT signals that cannot be
ignored, but that's a result of how they work and it is explicitly
specified in standards) -- everything else is unexpected semantics.

 s/argue/discuss/
 Anyway, since the code seems to work like I describe/expect, there is
really no problem for me.  Haven't you meant SIG_DFL, actually?
