yeah, that reminds me...tulip can only DMA to word aligned addresses.
I looked it up again in DEC 21143 HWREF (page 113 of the pdf):
        Table 4-3. RDES2 Bit Field Description
    Field      Description
    31:0       Buffer Address 1
               Indicates the physical address of buffer 1. 
               The buffer must be longword aligned (RDES2<1:0> = 00).
Same is true for TX/RX descriptor addresses.
Behavior is undefined if the addresses for DMA are not 4-byte aligned.
Anyone know if that's true for NS83820?
I couldn't find which driver controls that chip/NIC via a quick grep.
