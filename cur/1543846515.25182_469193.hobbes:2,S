I (well, me and my team) am supporting a customer using a RHEL 4
userspace and a 2.6.16 kernel with Ingo's real-time patches.  We just
used Red Hat config file as the basis, and it wasn't that hard.  There
were some initrd breakages, which I've complained about in the past,
but the goal is that this sort of thing is supposed to work!  (And for
the most part, it does).

I'm currently using the latest 2.6 kernel with Ubuntu 6.06 (their
stable release), and to date, I haven't had any problems.  
Of course, that may be about to change, given that Ubuntu is shipping
with wireless-tools version "27+28pre13-1ub", which I assume is a
version between 27 and 28.  Do you know off-hand whether this is is
WE-21 capable?
