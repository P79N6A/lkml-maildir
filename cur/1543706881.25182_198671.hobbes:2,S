Seems to work just great here... I also did some testing before i
applied it.
I tested Uberbios for my mb, but it didn't help at all, actually it
seemed quite odd... (Strange values etc)
Now i'm back to normal bios and running Ross' quality work again! =)
Keep up the good work guys, seems like the trade off is getting smaller
and smaller =). Btw, uptime before i decided that i should update kernel
was 17 days (haven't had any nforce in quite some time when running
ross' quality work, so the uptime more reflects my eagerness to update
kernels and stuff)
