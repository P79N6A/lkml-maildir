Yes, that's it! Jeepers, I can't believe that even re-reading the past
LKML posts (even those!) I couldn't find the EDID info and how we had
gotten them. I guess I need stronger glasses.
Wonder why Luca's proposed patch makes the EDID undetectable, now, and
why can't it be retrieved at a later time via i2c. Timeouts too small?

Yes, it's the same hardware. I can try the patch, with or without Luca's.
