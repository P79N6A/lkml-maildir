The reason I found Linus's suggestion desirable is because it
fundamentally does not require git to track any metadata.  If
the commits are in git, then his script would let you gather the
data, but otherwise you should be able to do the same by
grepping patches.  Obviously you would need to filter by paths,
looking at the diffstat, but the approach does _not_ tie users
to git.
