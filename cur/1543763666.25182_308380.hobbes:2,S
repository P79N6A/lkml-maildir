Ken, given that you don't have the bandwidth to keep all of those disks 
fully utilized, do you have any idea how big a performance hit you would 
take going to larger, but slower SATA drives?
given that this would let you get the same storage with about 1200 fewer 
drives (with corresponding savings in raid controllers, fiberchannel 
controllers and rack frames) it would be interesting to know how close it 
would be (for a lot of people the savings, which probably are within 
spitting distance of $1M could be work the decrease in performance)
