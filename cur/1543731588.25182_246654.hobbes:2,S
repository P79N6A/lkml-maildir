Hurrah ! Definately the best way to go as far as Samba is concerned.
Makes our portability easier. Now the NT interface allows an open on
a named data stream without an open on the containing file (ie.
you can do CreateFile("filename::STREAMNAME",....) without doing
CreateFile("filename",..." first, but I personally think those
semantics are a nasty hack. It makes much more sense (IMHO) to
ensure that you already have an open fd on a file before allowing
access to the named streams inside, Windows be damned. If we have
some semantic issues mapping from the Windows semantics to Solaris/Linux
semantics then so be it, it's a Samba problem so to speak :-).
Thanks,
