Additional metadata can be stored as comments. i.e. given the right
tools anything that goes from a BK patchset into $SCM can be turned back
into a BK patchset later on. Same holds for the other direction as long
as the comments are preserved.

As far as I could see Tom was talking about bi-directional gateways
between arch, _subversion_, and BK.

That's a pretty harsh statement, especially since critical parts of the
system have already been reimplemented in C or perl. In a way your
comment is almost similar to...
#   Writing a new OS only for the 386 in 1991 gets you your second 'F'

Perhaps the time wasn't ripe, ideas and views on SCM systems have
shifted over the years, and yes BK has probably set some new standards
here, but it is always harder to break new ground.

Having an open platform for exchanging patchsets between SCM systems
also allows people to try out different systems. Perhaps they want to
working in parallel with their existing system for a while before
finally moving everything over to the better system.
