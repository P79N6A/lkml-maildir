I'm not sure what you're getting at.  Each loop iteration is analogous
to a user->kernel->user transition with respect to the
save/reload/use/restore pattern on the segment register.  In this case,
%fs starts as a null selector, gets reloaded with a non NULL selector,
and then is restored to null.  Do you mean some other mixing?
