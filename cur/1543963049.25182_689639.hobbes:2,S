This doesn't sound like a coherency problem to me, and least not one you'd find
on PowerPC.  Both the driver and the application run on the host CPU, so there
shouldn't be any coherency problem.  My understanding is that a "non coherent"
platform is one where the host CPU isn't aware when a *hardware device* writes
directly to memory, e.g. via DMA.
