What is the currently recommended procedure for merging a maintainer
tree with mainline in order to reorder all of the fixes in the
maintainer tree, after the changes in the linux-2.6. tree (to make the
eventual merge from Linus easier)?
In this particular case, the
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/sfrench/cifs-2.6.git
 tree
has a few dozen changesets that are not in its parent yet (and the
cifs-2.6.git is at 2.6.22-rc5 level)
(
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git
) but
mainline now has fixes which affect the same directory as the
maintainer tree maintains.
If I do a "git pull" from cifs-2.6.git tree that will pull in the
required changes from mainline but there will be cluttered merge
messages when Linus pulls cifs-2.6.git into his tree.
What is the current recommended way to handle this?
