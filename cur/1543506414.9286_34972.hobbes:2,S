Subject: dual PIII 450Mhz on P2B-DS - big problem

	Hi,
	I'm using a Dual PIII@450Mhz/Asus P2B-DS. I used that for a month without problems, but now I'm experiencing some sporadic errors when I want to use the Hard-Disk. I tried some EIDE HD, some SCSI HD, using or not the on-board controller, it's the same.
	I have this problem only with Linux (Suse 6.1, Kernel 2.2.5, I tried 2.2.7 too), that I actually cannot install any more: when I try to create an ext2 Partition (mke2fs) on the hard disk, booting from CD-ROM, at some point the program is blocked, without any error message. At this point I still can switch the tty (alt-F1, F2...) but I cannot type anything.
	I installed Win95 and WinNT without apparent problems.
	Ideas, advices, experiences???? I just want to hear something from you before I dig in the kernel.
	thank you in advance
		ben
