the 2.3.7 pagecache changes give so much more than just raw SMP
performance:
- write()s do not have to copy data twice anymore. Until now, every
  write() first copied data from user-space into the 'buffer-cache', then
  copied those changes into the 'page-cache' as well. With 2.3.7 only the
  page-cache is used for caching file data. This is what other OSs
  sometimes call a 'unified page cache'. [note that read() was already
  'unified' since the 2.0 kernel - this is why this problem only showed up
  for certain, write intensive applications like Squid] This has two
  benefits: the obvious performance win, but more importantly, we dont do
  'double buffering' anymore, which reduces memory pressure alot. I have
  (some time ago) benchmarked Squid with a memory-intensive workload, and
  saw a 30% speedup just due to no double-buffering.
 - fsync() got much faster. Now that the page cache is used for caching
  file data exclusively, it's much easier to find all cached pages
  belonging to a file. Former kernels had to do costy buffer-cache lookups
  for every _possible_ cached page/buffer - this was quite an overhead for
  large files.
 - bmap() overhead is completely eliminated for cached read()/write().
   Until now, every IO and every write() had to call an fs-specific 
   'bmap()' function, which parsed file metadata to find out the
   logical->physical block mapping of data blocks. This is now cached in
   per-page structures and speeds up write() and read() noticeably. It
   also possibly enables us to free filesystem metadata much more
   aggressively even if data contents remain cached. 
 - 'partial page' IO and cached IO got better. We do the right thing
   for everything, if on a 1k filesystem, one block within a page is
   dirtied, we do not read-in the rest of the page. If it's read
   afterwards then we do not read-back the already dirtied block. These
   sorts of 'partial page' properties got much more 'right' with the new
   pagecache. 
there are a couple of other improvements as well. In short, the pagecache
simply got perfect, we just have to fix a couple of bugs :)

i'd suggest trying pre2-2.3.8, Linus has fixed a couple of bad bugs which
could corrupt file data and cause oopses.
