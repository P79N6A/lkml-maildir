At least under 2.0 I get the proper response:
bash$ mkdir -p test/test1
bash$ ls -Rl test
total 1
drwxr-xr-x   2 pollard  users        1024 Feb 24 11:33 test1
test/test1:
total 0
bash$ cd test/test1
bash$ pwd
/tmp/test/test1
bash$ /bin/pwd
/tmp/test/test1
bash$ chmod 000 ..
bash$ pwd
/tmp/test/test1
bash$ /bin/pwd
/bin/pwd: cannot get current directory: Permission denied
I thought getcwd was doing the I/O to determine the working directory.
To get a _final_ word we'd have to "use the Source". Does strace work
through shared libraries? I don't know that answer either; it seems like
it would.
