I recently bought a SPARCstation 20 to mess with, and threw a fresk copy
of Linux on it. It works yadda yadda whatever.
So I go to build a new kernel for it, which I am assuming succeeded (make
boot exits clean). What files are actually the kernel? I know in i386 its
arch/i386/boot/[b|bz]Image...I would have assumed the same for SPARC, but
in arch/sparc/boot, there's just a couple object files. Yes, i read the
documentation. Yes, the documentation is _very_ i386-specific, so I was
unable to find out what files I would need to copy (There's also no make
install target on SPARC). 
What files do I need to copy over to the /boot dir to get this working?
Thanks,
