i have to admit the last time i timed any of the methods on linux was in
2.0.x days.  thanks for the updated data!

sysv semaphores have a very unfortunate negative feature -- if the admin
kill -9's the server (impatient admins do this all the time) then you end
up leaving a semaphore lying around.  sysvsem don't have the usual unix
unlink semantics.  actually flock has the same problem... which is why i
generally preferred fcntl whenever it was a performance wash, as it was
back in 2.0.x days.
however given the vast performance difference i think it warrants the
change.  i'll include your results with the commit.

per linus' request i'll unserialise 2.2 as well.
i'll leave 2.0.x settings alone.
(oh yeah, and compile-time only detection.)
