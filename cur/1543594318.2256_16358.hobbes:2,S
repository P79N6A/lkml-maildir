Hi Rik,
While I was testing this suggestion (still actually) prior to your
RFT, the first thing I did was the straight substitution, but under
heavy load, the additional swap/aging when there is a ~persistant
shortage hurt ~fairly badly.  What I did instead, and shows no ill
effects under any load I've tried so far was...
		/* If needed, try to free some memory. */
		if (inactive_shortage() || free_shortage())
			do_try_to_free_pages(GFP_KSWAPD, 0);
		else {
			/* Do background page aging. */
			swap_out(DEF_PRIORITY, GFP_KSWAPD);
			refill_inactive_scan(DEF_PRIORITY, 0);
		}
I still had the benefit of idle pages being pushed to disk quickly
and staying there :)  IMHO, this is the first real candidate for a
sysctl tunable, as it's possibly not good for everyone.  As indicated
privately, I like the effect of this suggestion a lot, but laptop
people may not because of the infrequent and miniscule swapin (which
_might_ be an irritant _if_ they are doing enough work etc etc).

(this report would have landed in your mailbox tomorrow.. I was too
slow.  sending it to lkml lest someone sees the same high load thing
I did and determine it's a loss unfairly)
