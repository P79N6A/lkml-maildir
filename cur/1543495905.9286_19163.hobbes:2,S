Hello,
I've posted a version of Matt Welsh's bigphysarea patch against 2.2.9
at:
http://web.mountain.net/~tleete/bigphysarea-config-2.2.9-patch.gz
Added Config Language and Configure.help support so it plays nice with
make, a tweak of the proc fs interface to report the address of the
reserved memory, and catted up the docs into
Documentation/bigphysarea.txt, and removed a little dead code.
The patch should work for any architecture, but i386 is best-developed,
and is the only platform I have personally tested.
The code inserts a memory allocation in kernel_init just after any
initrd is discarded, and before the vm subsystem is initialized. This
allocation's size is set by a command line parameter. The result is a
contiguous unswapped region suitable for framebuffers and other
real-time devices. The area is typically low enough in memory to be
visible to ISA bus devices.
This version of bigphysarea is based on Roger Butenuth's extension,
which includes his /proc support and a set of aligned allocators [ where
is R.B.? I can't contact him.]
Hope this is of use to somebody,
Tom Leete,
