So your patches "dont build" because some Sparc configs produce new 
(presumably harmless) warnings?
And the solution is to not do your patch and export other warnings to the 
core kerne, which then get reported as bugs there and which result in 
fugly fixes? (and which resulted in a crapload of ugly fixes in the past 
10 years)
That is quite backwards, no matter how i look at it. Why doesnt Sparc do 
the obvious and turn off -Werror until it has gotten around to fix those 
few remaining warnings? It took me 30 minutes to fix up PowerPC defconfig 
with a similar change, it cannot be that much harder on Sparc either 
(powerpc arch code is a lot larger in fact). I'd be surprised if it took 
more than 10 minutes of davem's time.
