PnP crypto? I'd love to see it. :)
That could actually be used somehow as some sort of pseudo-random 
generator, given the legendary oh-so-predictable behaviour of most 
BIOSes, even in normal circumstances... :D

Uhmm... Odds: 1 in <buffer overflow>
Considering that they seem to see BIOSes as the easiest way to hide 
hardware design mistakes, they probably wont.
OTOH, why not sticking Linux straight into BIOS flash chips?
Have a look here (sorry if you already knew):
http://www.linuxbios.org/
http://freebios.sourceforge.net/
Or just implement an OpenFirmware BIOS (that's cool! :)?

Have fun.
