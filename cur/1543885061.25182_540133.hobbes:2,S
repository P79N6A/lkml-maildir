We also have DAC and ADC drivers (up to 16 bits @ 64MS/s, via DMA), that would 
be nice to put in the "right" place  - I don't think that drivers/char is the 
right place, nor drivers/misc - I also don't think that /adc is a descriptive 
place for DAC or mixed signal front ends (MxFE).
What about /drivers/char/daq or just drivers/daq - drivers for 
non-PCI/USB/ISA/PCMCIA Data Acquisition Hardware, D/A and A/D converters, 
Analog Front ends, etc.
I think that is the common TLA - at least according to 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_acquisition
?
