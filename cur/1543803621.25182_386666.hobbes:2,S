Randy,
Any chance you can add PATA support as well for this? Many of the
notebooks out there with SATA controllers really have PATA devices
behind a bridge, I think it's pretty much a pre-requisite for this to be
considered complete that this is supported as well. The code should be
the same, it just needs to lookup the right taskfiles. Right now on this
T43, it finds nothing.
