Hi!
Like always, pleas CC me as I'm currently not suscribed, I hope I got the 
right persons already in list.
When booting my new shiny 2.6.24-rc1 I get a crash if uvesafb is compiled in. 
The trace mentiones something about "platform_match", so I guess this is due 
x86 unification.
If helpfull I could try getting something over netconsole, but I think this is 
a minor glitch, as vesafb boots fine. :)
Ah, and token ring tells me something like
"/net/token-ring ,3.14 sysctl failed check procname does not match binary path 
procname"
But kernel boots otherwise and I got no chance to test tr itself is working.
