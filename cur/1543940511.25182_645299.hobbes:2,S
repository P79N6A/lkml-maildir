Maybe we better focus on one call at a time?

If it does not run in write mode then concurrent faults are permissible 
while we remap pages. Weird. Maybe we better handle this like individual
page operations? Put the invalidate_page back into zap_pte. But then there 
would be no callback w/o lock as required by Robin. Doing the 
invalidate_range after populate allows access to memory for which ptes 
were zapped and the refcount was released.

Hmmm... Right. Did not consider get_user_pages. A write to the page that 
is not marked dirty would typically require a fault that will serialize.
