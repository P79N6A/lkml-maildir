   this does it!
   
Alexey, my current suspect is skb->csum state on retransmit.
BTW, how come tcp_trim_head() can just set skb->ip_summed
blindly to CHECKSUM_HW and not setup skb->csum?  Even if you
can depend upon net/core/dev.c to do the checksum for
you, you still would need to setup skb->csum properly.
