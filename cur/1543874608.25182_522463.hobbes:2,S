Note the word "currently".  And yes, we did talk about hints.  Back then
I still believed in UBI.  That has changed and I would like to spare
myself another flamewar, so please leave it at that.

Correct.  And I don't see any problem with this.  I see two classes of
usecases for flash, with some amount of overlap in between.
1. Small amounts of flash.
Here the flash contains a large ratio of read-only data.  Bootloader,
kernel, etc.  Having wear levelling across the device will gain you
something.  This is what you designed UBI for.
2. Large amounts of flash.
Just to be precise, large can go well into the Terabyte range and
beyond.  I don't mean large as in "the biggest embedded device I worked
on last year" - that is still small.
Even if such flashes still contain a bootloader and a kernel, that will
occupy less than 1% of the device.  Wear leveling across the device is
fairly pointless here.  This is what I designed LogFS for.
There is some middle ground where a combination of UBI and LogFS may
make sense.  LogFS can still make sense for devices as small as 64MiB.
But I'm not too concerned about that because flashes will continue to
grow and the advantages of cross-device wear leveling will continue to
diminish.
