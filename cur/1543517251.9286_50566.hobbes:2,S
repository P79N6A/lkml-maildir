Subject: [PATCH] Cleanup of version code checks, part I
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

My goal with this patch and another upcoming patch is to make the
checking of kernel version consistent throughout the kernel.  For the
most part, these changes are cosmetic, although I have uncovered a few
bugs by doing this.
This patch takes all the version code checks that were made against a
constant (either decimal or hex) and changes them to using the
KERNEL_VERSION macro.  This uncovered a nice "feature" in GCC that when
a macro with no args is undefined and used in a #if comparison, GCC
silently sets its value to zero.  This means that some places
(udf_fs_sb.h for example) that were missing a #include <linux/version.h>
were possibly miscompiling.
On another note, the KERNEL_VERSION macro was introduced in 2.1.90.  If
driver maintainers wish to actively support kernels older than this then
they should add to their code:
#ifndef KERNEL_VERSION
#define KERNEL_VERSION(a,b,c) (((a) << 16) + ((b) << 8) + (c))
#endif
My next patch will cover the cases that use a redundant macro (ie,
LinuxVersionCode).
Please test this patch a bit before I send it to Linus.
