Not critical at all.  I have forwarded Marcelo a patch which fixes one
of the problems in ppp_generic.c by changing all_ppp_lock into a
semaphore.  I agree that the rest of the fixes can wait for the
2.4.19-pre series.  The problems tend to show up mainly on SMP boxes
handling multiple PPP connections.  I posted the patch so that the
people who were having problems could try it and let me know if it
fixed their problems.
I would appreciate it though if you had time to look over the patch
and see if you think I have missed any potential races.
As for the documentation patch, it's not going to affect any code
behaviour, so it can go in whenever you and Marcelo think is
appropriate. :)
Paul.
