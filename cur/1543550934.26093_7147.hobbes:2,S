It doesn't have to be inefficient - on x86 for example it's common to
return double results in ax:dx.  Then a two-int struct can be passed
back just like a double.  
If it was solid on all platforms I'd use it (it isn't - flunked my test
case, bad start).  Even if it wasn't particularly efficient, so long as
not grossly inefficient (passing back a linked list of bits would be too
slow).  Where correctness matter more than efficiency, which is most
places, why not?
The other problem is that C doesn't have any nice syntax for handling a
struct result. You have to do something like:
	struct result result = unreliable();
	if (result.errror) goto do_something;
	<do something with result.value>
which isn't a lot better than:
	
	int err;
	int value = unreliable(&err);
	if (err) goto do_something;
	<do something with value>
To be nice to use, it would have to look something like:
	with unreliable() if (!error) <do something with value>
which is essentially a lambda expression.  But that's another language.
Throwing and catching exceptions lets you get rid of a huge amount of
this ugly, error prone kind of code, but there is a well known problem:
C doesn't have exceptions.  So that's out.  I think the answer is, there
is no answer.  One day I'd like to take some time and hack in an
exception thrower/catcher as a demonstration.

That makes sense to me :-)
