Hi mailing list.
This kernel is used from business critical servers over desktops to 
embedded devices.
It got rather important - as it's versioning did. Changing it leads into 
confusion, as we saw, so one shouldn't play with those numbers.
I think it does (almost) not matter which versioning gets chosen - but 
once chosen, one should stick to it.
Sincerely yours,
		Daniel Herzog
