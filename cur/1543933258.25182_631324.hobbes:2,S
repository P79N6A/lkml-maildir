With 2.6.24-rc2, plugging and unplugging power results in a sudden
reboot. After the reboot, the machine boots normally until it switches
to graphics mode, at which point the screen is scrambled. It may hang or
repeatedly reboot at this point. Easily repeatable after just a few plug
cycles.
Switching back to 2.6.23-rc3-mm1, I can do a dozen plug cycles with no
problem.
Machine is a Thinkpad R51, with R250:
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc Radeon R250
[Mobility FireGL 9000] (rev 02)
