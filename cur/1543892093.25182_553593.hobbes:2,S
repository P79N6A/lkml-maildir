The same condition that occurs when there is a system-wide OOM, yes.  
Exclusive cpusets cannot be violated for such allocations outside of the 
obvious GFP_ATOMIC exception.

That's arbitrary.  The idea is that an exclusive cpuset should not 
encounter memory pressure because another exclusive cpuset encountered an 
OOM condition because its zones happened to be higher on the zonelist.  
Notice how, without this change, it's possible to allocate on a node 
outside our mems_allowed before we use our own memory reserves.
