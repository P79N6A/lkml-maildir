Usage of ioctl() on Linux was a bad idea and it's going to be fixed. More
or less in the same direction, not exactly the same - 4.4 chflags() works
fine for UFS and leaves other filesystems to map what they can into the
UFS set. Which is bogus - immutable is not a UFS attribute, it's VFS one.
I have a patch (still pre-alpha) and I'll post it tomorrow or on Wednesday
when I'll be back from CA.
As for the opening with no permissions - well, it would make *big* sense
if we could narrow down the API and move chown(), chmod(), etc. into libc
leaving f-variants in the kernel. Binary compatibility... Extreme variant
might include {set,get}sockopt extended to files and doing both *stat and
*ch{mod,own,flags} via that. Out of curiosity - did somebody on *BSD side
play with that?
