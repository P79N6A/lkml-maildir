For a Linux distro to ship DSDT override images, they'd have to
have some licensing & support arrangement with the OEM
who actually owns that BIOS code.
While this wouldn't defy any laws of physics, it doesn't
look compatible with current industry business practices.
OEMs are more likely to simply ship a BIOS update ISO.
