Hi!
In www.sf.net/projects/suspend 's CVS, there is a new version of s2ram
program. Now it includes vbetool, and long whitelist copied from
acpi_support-0.52 (thanks!).
Unlike using Doc*/power/video.txt stuff, where you need to configure
command line and/or set up scripts, it should just work. It if does
not, it should be easy to add your machine into whitelist.
Please test,
								Pavel
