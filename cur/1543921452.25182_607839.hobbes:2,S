OK, I missed that you set the new inode's aops to the ramdisk_aops
rather than the bd_inode. Which doesn't make a lot of sense because
you just have a lot of useless aops there now.

It's a data corruption issue. I think it should be fixed.

Wrong. It will be via the LRU, will get ->writepage() called,
block_invalidate_page, etc. And I guess also via sb->s_inodes, where
drop_pagecache_sb might do stuff to it (although it probably escapes
harm). But you're right that it isn't the obviously correct fix for
the problem.

If you think it is a nice way to go, then I think you are
blind ;)

Obviously a simple typo that can be fixed by adding one line
of code.

It's horrible. And using truncate_inode_pages / grab_cache_page and
new_inode is an incredible argument to save a few lines of code. You
obviously didn't realise your so called private pages would get
accessed via the LRU, for example. This is making a relatively
larger logical change than my patch, because now as well as having
a separate buffer cache and backing store, you are also making the
backing store pages visible to the VM.

I think it's a bad idea just to stir the shit. We should take the
simple fix for the problem, and then fix it properly.
