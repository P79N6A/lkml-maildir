No.
It really depends on what distros do.

If all distros set SCHED_DEBUG=y then fine.
But if they do this then we should do this at the kernel.org level, and
make it a hard-to-turn-off thing via CONFIG_EMBEDDED=y.

I'm not detecting here a sufficient appreciation of the number of
sched-related regressions we've seen in recent years, nor of the
difficulty encountered in diagnosing and fixing them.  Let alone
the difficulty getting those fixes propagated out a *long* time
after the regression was added.
You're taking a whizzy new feature which drastically changes a critical
core kernel feature and jamming it into mainline with a vestigial
amount of testing coverage without giving sufficient care and thought
to the practical lessons which we have learned from doing this in the
past.
This is a highly risky change.  It's not that the probability of
failure is high - the problem is that the *cost* of the improbable
failure is high.  We should seek to minimize that cost.
