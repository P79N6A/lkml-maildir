My AMD64-based box (Asus L5D) does not resume from disk on battery power
any more, even if booted with init=/bin/bash.
I think this is related to Bug #4959, which remains a mistery, but now it
also does not resume with CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB unset.
Andi, is it possible that an MCE occurs when the image is copied (ie. while
the code in arch/x86_64/kernel/suspend_asm.S is being executed)?
Greetings,
Rafael
