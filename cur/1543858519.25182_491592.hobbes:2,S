.... or like Microsoft, who is threatening to make war on end-users
instead of settling things with vendors.  (One of the reasons why I
personally find the Microsoft promise not to sue _Novell_'s end users
so nasty.  Microsoft shouldn't be threatening anyone's users; if they
have a problem, they should be taking it up with the relevant vendor,
not sueing innocent and relatively shallow-pocketed end-users and
distributors.)
One of the things that I find so interesting about how rabid people
get about enforcing GPL-only modules is how they start acting more and
more like the RIAA, MPAA, and Microsoft every day....
