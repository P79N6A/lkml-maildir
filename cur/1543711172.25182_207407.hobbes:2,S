It also has the advantage of working extremely reliably on 2.4 (and a
large part of the code base is shared, so that's a significant data
point). I couldn't get it to crash or do anything bad for months now,
and I'm doing at least several suspend/resumes a day on my laptop.
Also, thanks to the excellent compression feature, suspend/resume times
are very short and in fact competitive with suspend-to-ram schemes.
I think it's better not to mix personal preferences (such as the
escape-to-abort thing) with technical discussions. On a practical level,
swsusp2 is the only implementation which works reliably, does its job
very well, and has a responsive maintainer willing to fix problems as
they arise.
