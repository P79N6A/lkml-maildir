I did more tests, this time with 2.6.13-rc3-mm2 (machine is a TP 600X),
and I don't think the problem is related to firmware loading.  If I
first physically eject the card (an Intersil wireless card), swsusp
prints
PM: Writing image
PCI: Found IRQ 11 for device .....
PCI: Sharing IRQ 11 with ...
PCI: Sharing IRQ 11 with ...
PCI: Found IRQ 11 for device .....
then it writes pages to swap and all is well.  Well, almost 100%; the
one glitch is that sometimes X comes back blank and I have to
ctrl-alt-F7 to bring back the display; or X comes back with the keyboard
acting strange (<ENTER> shifts the display left by a few hundred
pixels), and again ctrl-alt-F7 fixes it.  This is with XFree86
4.3.0.dfsg.1-14, and maybe after I upgrade (?) to the xorg server, that
glitch will go away.  Anyway, it's easy to work around.
But, if I leave the card in and prepare the hibernation with
ifdown eth0
cardctl eject
modprobe -r prism54
(so eject the module for and stop all uses of the card), then swsusp
prints the PCI messages above, but hangs before writing the pages to
swap.  I'm using a hibernate.sh script (included below) for those steps.
It does a few others like stopping the hotplug system.
After 'cardctl eject' and removing the module, there's no evidence of
the hardware available to the kernel, as far as I can tell.  lspci
doesn't show it, for example.  So the system is not loading firmware
during the hibernate attempt, and I'm not sure what step is hanging.
[Should this report go to acpi-devel and/or the ACPI or kernel bugzilla,
or is that more for S1/S3 rather than for hibernation?]
Here is lspci with the card inserted:

Here is the list of modules present just before the (working and
non-working) hibernation (for debugging, the hibernate.sh script does
'lsmod |logger' before hibernating):
  ip_conntrack_ftp
  snd_mixer_oss
  ipv6
  pcmcia
  crc32
  parport_pc
  lp
  parport
  thermal
  fan
  button
  processor
  ac
  battery
  ipt_state
  ipt_LOG
  iptable_filter
  iptable_nat
  ip_conntrack
  ip_tables
  8250
  serial_core
  intel_agp
  firmware_class
  snd_cs46xx
  snd_rawmidi
  snd_seq_device
  snd_ac97_codec
  snd_pcm
  snd_timer
  snd
  soundcore
  snd_page_alloc
  yenta_socket
  rsrc_nonstatic
  pcmcia_core
  agpgart
  speedstep_lib
I don't think any of those modules intrinsically are a problem, since
swsusp works with all of them (as long as the Intersil card is not
inserted).  And here is the hibernate.sh script:
#!/bin/bash
# suspend to disk (hibernate), stopping drivers that might break the
#   hibernation setup
to_stop='chrony pdnsd mysql hotplug'
to_start='hotplug pdnsd chrony'
unload='prism54'
ifdown eth0
cardctl eject
for s in $to_stop ; do /etc/init.d/$s stop ; done
for m in $unload ; do modprobe -r $m ; done
hwclock --systohc
logger -t hibernate.sh About to hibernate
ps axwww   | logger -t "hibernate.sh ps"
lsmod | logger -t "hibernate.sh lsmod"
sync
sleep 2
echo -n disk > /sys/power/state
hwclock --hctosys
logger -t hibernate.sh Returning from hibernation
for s in $to_start ; do
  /etc/init.d/$s start
done
