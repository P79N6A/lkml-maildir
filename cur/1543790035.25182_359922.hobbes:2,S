Hi Paul,
I realized CPUSETS has another problem around pdflush.
Some cpuset may make most of pages in it dirty, while the others don't.
In this case, pdflush may not start since the ratio of the dirty pages
in the box may be less than the watermark, which is defined globally.
This may probably make it hard to allocate pages from the cpuset
or the nodes it depends on. This wouldn't be good for NUMA machine
without cpusets either.
Do you have any plans about it?

Thanks,
