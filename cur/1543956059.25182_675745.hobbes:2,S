If program have temporary data, it may cause inconsistency.
I think that information should be referred to original(control mechanism).
Information of cgroup is controlled at cgroup subsystem (and cgroupfs_root).
So, I think that it's better to query into cgroup subsystem.
Now, cgroup susbsystem would not change root group.
Therefore, system would also runs by your suggestion.
I will consider this issue.
Thanks,
