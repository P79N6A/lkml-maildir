These projects are probably losing plenty of trivial bug reports 
from people who shouldn't have to register with a bug tracker and 
fill in a long form every time to submit a short bug report.

Most of the time bugzilla appears to be a great way to ignore 
bugs. Every large project seems to have one with bugs that 
stay open for years - bugzilla's own inability to quick search 
without javascript[1] being a good example (it's fixed now). 
If no one can get around to fixing reported bugs why should 
anyone bother submitting more?
They even released their software with a link to the bug if 
you tried to do a quick search without javascript:

How will the people you ignore get their bugs fixed?

People are doing something about this, at least for tracking 
the regressions at 
http://kernelnewbies.org/known_regressions
 
(which is read-only unless you register, people have already 
commented on this).

I have had experience of this with the dvb mailing list (this was 
a couple of months before their news post referencing bugzilla 
too), even when I included a patch to fix it.
Someone suggested another way to fix a bug and I replied that it 
worked - that fix never went anywhere else and other people could 
be having the same problem today because it's still not been 
applied anywhere. (I will submit a -1 +1 patch myself when 
I have time this week).

Bugzilla's advanced search interface is far too crowded, that 
should be clear to anyone. The simpler search usually isn't much 
use because either it finds too many bugs or "zarro boogs" and 
you're left wondering if the bug is there or not.
