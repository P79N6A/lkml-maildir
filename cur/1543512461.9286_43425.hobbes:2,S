It is trickier than that. The problem is that 2.2.13pre14 has a deadlock
condition in the IDE code for SMP. 2.2.13pre15 fixes the deadlock but opens
a race condition in the request handling. Trying to fix that looks like someone
will finally have to fix the locking in the ide driver and the request queue
handling instead of continually hacking up an existing bad job.
And it won't be me...
