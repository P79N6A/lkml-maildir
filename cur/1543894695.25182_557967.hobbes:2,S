No, but you should if you haven't already.  I think GigaByte probably 
gets its BIOS from another BIOS vendor (maybe Intel), so when that 
vendor provides them with an update, they'll probably provide it on 
their website.  And from what I understand, an Intel BIOS update is in 
the works to address this issue for Intel boards, so a GigaByte version 
may follow shortly.  I don't have an exact timeframe though...
