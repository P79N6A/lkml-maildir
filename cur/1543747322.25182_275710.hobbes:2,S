That's my current impression. I also considered writing a simple kernel
module to intercept sys_brk, but that seemed to be a bit clumsy. We have
been running a test installation of Xen with 2 VMs under quite high load and
it performs outstandingly well in "laboratory environment".
Also, I seem to recall there used to be a patch for the linux kernel to implement 
BSD-like jail environment, which would suit my purpose too, do you know what happened
to the project/where it can be found? It would be a great addition to the
kernel, just like the Zones in Solaris 10 are (which are based on the BSD
jail concept as well).
