Hi,
Is it possible to wake-up my sleeping Linux by Ringing my Modem?,
There is an option in my BIOS (Phoenix), [Wake-Up on Modem Ring],
but turning on this option and enabling all the interrupts as system
activity does't help. I am running Linux 2.2.1 on Pentium 200MMX and
using an external modem. APM is compiled into Kernel, I normally
use apm --suspend to put my system in sleep mode. 
System uptime does't add-up the system suspend time!, Is it correct?
Thanks in advance for your help
Brdgs
