well, it could, and probably in future it will do so,
but currently there are three reasons which keep me
from doing that:
 1) some folks want to use LSM for other things, and
    proper stackering of LSM was broken/missing last
    time I looked at the code 
 2) performance: I'm not convinced that the LSM
    hooks are a good choice, where a single check
    of a flag (in current) is more than sufficient
 3) why move 20% of linux vserver to LSM, where
    those 20% can not do anything useful without the
    remaining 80% (or at least some part of it)
    which can not be done with LSM for various
    reasons.

I'm sure the projects can share code, and IMHO the
best solution would be to create a 'cripled' version
of linux-vserver and to include it in mainline (if
that is what kernel folks want) and to slowly extend
this version where possible, moving existing code
from linux-vserver into mainline ...
once CKRM is working and included, and LSM provides
the 'security' features, linux-vserver might become
a simple compile time option ...
best,
Herbert
