Not really, athough I was surprised when I noticed that I have extra
mouse devices. I would expect most people using /dev/input/mice which
multiplexes data streams from all mouse-like devices.
I think wacom users will be in for surprise because wacom requres you
to specify exact device name the regular mouse is using. I actually
think wacom X driver shoudl do what Synaptics does and grab evdev
intrface.
