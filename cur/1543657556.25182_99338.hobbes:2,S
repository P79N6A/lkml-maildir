Your patch is bad. Lowlevel drivers allocate the hardware resources (see
snd_cs4231_create() or snd_ad1848_create() code), but these functions will
fail, because you allocate resources in the top-level code. I think that 
it will be sufficient to replace check_region call with request_region and 
release_resource. The collision frame is so small and the code returns 
with an error code when a problem occurs.
