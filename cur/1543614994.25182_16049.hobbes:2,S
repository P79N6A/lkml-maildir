The __devexit_p changes are required in addition to .text.lock ->
.subsection, they are fixing different parts of the same problem.  Most
of the devexit_p changes were in my patch against 2.4.17-pre6, all of
those changes are needed.  The only devexit changes from 2.4.17-pre6 to
2.4.17 are :-
drivers/char/synclink.c
  Spurious, there is no point in specifying __init, __exit etc. on the
  declaration, those attributes only affect the function body.  The
  change has no effect.  Anybody want to go through and remove spurious
  __init, __exit etc. on forward function declarations?
drivers/pcmcia/i82092.c
  Mine, valid AFAICT.
drivers/isdn/hisax/hisax_fcpcipnp.c
  Don't know who changed it but it is valid.  hisax_fcpcipnp was added
  after my first patch against 2.4.16 and I missed the new driver when
  I redid the devexit_p patch for 2.4.17.
I would add all the devexit_p changes through 2.4.17 at least, in
addition to the .text.lock changes.
