You can't use your own SYSENTER. Since sysenter doesn't pass the original
address and the kernel always returns to a fixed address - which is in the vsyscall
page. The fixed address is used because there are not enough registers to pass
both syscall arguments and return address.
The instruction has a few other quirks and isn't exactly the best one Intel
ever designed.

Hmm, it should do an 32bit syscall even from 64bit. I can take a look.

Intel machines have it, but they don't have SYSCALL from compat mode. That
is why both are implemented. It should end at the code in ia32entry.S 
Again you can't use your own - so likely it is returning to the vsyscall page
and then jumping to a bogus address on the stack. You can verify that by
single stepping through it with a debugger.

On AMD it should work. The kernel vsyscall page uses it.
