note that the typo was not in the weight table but in the inverse weight 
table which didnt really affect CPU utilization (that's why we didnt 
notice the typo sooner). Regarding the above problem with nice +15 being 
beefier than intended i'd suggest to re-test with a doubled 
/proc/sys/kernel/sched_runtime_limit value, or with:
  echo 30 > /proc/sys/kernel/sched_features
(which turns off sleeper fairness)

i think this was scheduling jitter caused by the larger granularity of 
negatively reniced tasks. This got improved recently, with latest -git i 
get:
  PID USER      PR  NI  VIRT  RES  SHR S %CPU %MEM    TIME+  COMMAND
 3108 root       5 -15  1576  248  196 R  5.0  0.0   0:07.26 loop_silent
 3109 root       5 -15  1576  248  196 R  5.0  0.0   0:07.26 loop_silent
 3110 root       5 -15  1576  248  196 R  5.0  0.0   0:07.26 loop_silent
 3111 root       5 -15  1576  244  196 R  5.0  0.0   0:07.26 loop_silent
 3112 root       5 -15  1576  248  196 R  5.0  0.0   0:07.26 loop_silent
 3113 root       5 -15  1576  248  196 R  5.0  0.0   0:07.26 loop_silent
that's picture-perfect CPU time distribution. But, and that's fair to 
say, i never ran such an artificial workload of 20x nice -15 infinite 
loops (!) before, and boy does interactivity suck (as expected) ;)
