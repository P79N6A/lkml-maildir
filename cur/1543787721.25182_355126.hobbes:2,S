I mentioned this earlier in the thread.  I'm running 2.6.14-rc4 on a 
pentium-M based atca blade with a bit over 3GB of memory.  When I run 
the "rename14" test from LTP with /tmp mounted on tmpfs, the system runs 
out of zone normal memory and the OOM killer starts killing processes.
If I have /tmp mounted nfs, the problem doesn't occur.  If I use the 
boot args to limit the memory to 896MB the problem doesn't occur.  If I 
run the testcase on a dual Xeon with multiple gigs of memory, the 
problem doesn't occur.

This does not appear to be the case.  The testcase has two threads.
thread 1 loops doing the following:
fd = creat("./rename14", 0666);
unlink("./rename14");
close(fd);
thread 2 loops doing:
rename("./rename14", "./rename14xyz");

That's something I haven't checked...will have to get back to you.

Already tried.  You should be able to find results earlier in this thread.
