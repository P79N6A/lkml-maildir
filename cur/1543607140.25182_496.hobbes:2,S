That might be true in a democracy, but what do you do when you don't
live in such a place?  What if your government was not democractic but
"whoever has the most guns".  Are you saying that people who don't rebel
against people with guns are consenting?
Also, how can "every citizen be aware of the matters concerning the
State" when you live in a society where the State controls the media?
