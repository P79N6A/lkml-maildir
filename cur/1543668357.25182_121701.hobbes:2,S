Yes it would schedule the I/O in the desired manner.  But it would do that
for _all_ files, not just the desired one.
And that app needs to be changed to use fadvise anyway, to take down the
useless pagecache.

Approximately once per 1000 dirtied pages per cpu.  Say 4 megs.  A nice
chunk.

Well...  One could place a hint in the inode somewhere. 
balance_dirty_pages() is given the inode, so it could notice that this is an
"early sync" inode and flush it every 4 megabytes.
That would be appropriate for O_STREAMING, which is a better and more
efficient interface than fadvise.
But really, the right thing to do here is to modify the app to use fadvise.

Might do.  I'm not sure how though.
Another possibility would be to perform speculative writes.  Write some
random data to a disk block and later see if that was the data which the
application actually wanted to write.  If so, we can optimise away the later
I/O.
