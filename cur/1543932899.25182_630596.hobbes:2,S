Hi Arjan,
I've not been able to find this file, "drivers/bluetooth/hci_tty.c", but 
anyway, This seems to be what happens: Hci_uart_close() flushes using 
hci_uart_flush().  Subsequently, in hci_dev_do_close(), (one step in 
hci_unregister_dev()), hci_uart_flush() is called again.  The comment in 
uart_flush_buffer(), relating to the WARN_ON(), indicates you can't 
flush after the port is closed; which sounds reasonable.  I think 
hci_uart_close() should set hdev->flush to NULL before returning.  
Hci_dev_do_close() does check for this.  The code path is rather 
involved and I'm not entirely clear of all steps, but I think that's 
what should be done.
Patch for stupidly obsolete kernel attached.
David
