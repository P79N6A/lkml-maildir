If these two tasks have the same nice value they should around robin 
with each other in the same priority slot and this means that the one 
doing the smaller bites of CPU each time will in fact get less CPU than 
the other i.e. the outcome will be the opposite of what you claim.
This does, of course, not take into account the interactive bonus.  If 
the task doing the shorter CPU bursts manages to earn a larger 
interactivity bonus than the other then it will get more CPU but isn't 
that the intention of the interactivity bonus?
