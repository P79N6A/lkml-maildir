Subject: [PATCH] i386: stand-alone CONFIG_PAE

Separate the config option for PAE from that for high memory beyond
4G, allowing configurations with non-execute protection without any
(potential) other overhead coming from HIGHMEM64G.
Also appropriately qualify both options depending on configured
minimum processor type.
