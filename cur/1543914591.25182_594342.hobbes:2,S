It is lacking because our vmap algorithms are simplistic to the point
of being utterly inadequate for the new requirements. There has not
been any fundamental problem revealed (like the fragmentation 
approach has).
However fsblock can do everything that higher order pagecache can
do in terms of avoiding vmap and giving contiguous memory to block
devices by opportunistically allocating higher orders of pages, and falling
back to vmap if they cannot be satisfied.
So if you argue that vmap is a downside, then please tell me how you
consider the -ENOMEM of your approach to be better?

I guess you're a little confused. There is nothing fake about the linear
address. Filesystems of course need changes (the block layer needs
none -- why would it?). But changing APIs to accommodate a better
solution is what Linux is about.
If, by special software layer, you mean the vmap/vunmap support in
fsblock, let's see... that's probably all of a hundred or two lines.
Contrast that with anti-fragmentation, lumpy reclaim, higher order
pagecache and its new special mmap layer... Hmm, seems like a no
brainer to me. You really still want to persue the "extra layer"
argument as a point against fsblock here?

Oh. I don't think I could explain that if you still don't understand by now.
But that's not the main issue: all that I ask is you consider fsblock on
technical grounds.

Of course I wouldn't state that. On the contrary, I categorically state that
I have already solved it :)

You have rejected it. But they are bogus reasons, as I showed above.
You also describe some other real (if lesser) issues like number of page
structs to manage in the pagecache. But this is hardly enough to reject
my patch now... for every downside you can point out in my approach, I
can point out one in yours.
- fsblock doesn't require changes to virtual memory layer
- fsblock can retain cache of just 4K in a > 4K block size file
How about those? I know very well how Linus feels about both of them.

That's conceptually much worse, IMO.
And practically worse as well: vmap space is limited on 32-bit; fsblock
approach can avoid vmap completely in many cases; for two reasons.
The fsblock data accessor APIs aren't _that_ bad changes. They change
zero conceptually in the filesystem, are arguably cleaner, and can be
essentially nooped if we wanted to stay with a b_data type approach
(but they give you that flexibility to replace it with any implementation).
