I agree with Al, Matthew and Pavel.  The current timer stuff is a pita
and needs fixing, and it seems Al has come up with a good way to do it
without adding additional crap into every single user of timers.
There *are* times when having the additional space for storing a pointer
is cheaper (in terms of number of bytes) than code to calculate an offset,
and those who have read the assembly code probably know this all too well.
Al - I look forward to your changes.
