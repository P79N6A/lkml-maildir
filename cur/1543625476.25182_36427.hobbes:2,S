Dan,
Thanks for pointing this out. I see that this change has now gone into
2.4.18 as well as 2.5.4. We would ensure that the down_write happens
only after the registers of all threads are collected.
Coming back to the original point raised by Pavel, indeed there is 
nothing preventing external code (any other kernel modules) modifying
the cpus_allowed field from under us. This could get worse in 2.5.x
where a user could change cpu affinity (through proc or a syscall, 
though I don't think the patches providing this are accepted as yet).
Vamsi.
