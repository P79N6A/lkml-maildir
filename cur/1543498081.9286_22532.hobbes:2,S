	Thank's Trond !
	I just tried it, and no crash ! (it used to crash within a matter
	of seconds).
	More than that, 2.2.9-ac1 behaves during NFS reading as well as
	2.2.6/2.2.7 :
IOZONE performance measurements:
        6126649 bytes/second for writing the file
        4501292 bytes/second for reading the file
	2.2.9 was really bad during reading and loads the knfsd server
	much too much.
