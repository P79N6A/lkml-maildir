Why? Just us FAT32 instead of NTFS.Also, Why the repartition?
Just reformat the old FAT32 partition and install over that.

Oll you should need is a boot floppy to get back into linux and fix
the MBR (rerun lilo?) after the Windows install.
Don't try to write to and NTFS partition from linux.
You probably don't want to mount the Win2k version of
NTFS in linux either. At one point that could damage the
filesystem too.
