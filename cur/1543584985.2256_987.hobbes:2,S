All of the 440*X Chipsets using a PIIX4/PIIX4AB/PIIX4EB are broken beyond
repair.  Several weeks ago, the old hat and I discussed the issue and
after sending him the same docs I have from Intel, we both laugh because
the errata clear states "NO FIX"
Now after going back to Intel with a puzzled look, I found out
why/where/how the breakage exists but the fix is not pretty nor does it
retain DMA transfer rates.
The hack job is fugly, it ruptures the ISR's the TIMERS and the PCI-DMA
space locally, but it is not a fatal barf, but a noisy messy one.
I will pop a nasty patch to get you through the almost death, but it is
nasty and not the preferred unknow solution.
