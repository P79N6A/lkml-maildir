Ok, thanks. I won't worry about those then.

The bug turned out to be in INITRD not IDE or PIIX. If and only if
I boot with an initrd the kernel hangs really hard somewhere in the
middle of a tar zxf of the kernel tarball (which is why I suspected IDE).
It seems like INITRD clobbers some critical data structure. (Neither the
NMI watchdog nor SysRQ would bring it out of the hang.)
