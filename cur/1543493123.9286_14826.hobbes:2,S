here they are:
"mappings
0.524288 677
1.048576 1193
2.097152 2189
4.194304 4379
8.388608 8993
16.777216 17745
33.554432 35039
I tried several runs and got very similar numbers. This is from the ultra5
running 2.2.2
and this is from the ultra5 running solaris 2.6
"mappings
0.524288 340
1.048576 526
2.097152 923
4.194304 1745
8.388608 4134
16.777216 9321
again, pretty repeatable.
