As "extern inline" is a GNU extension I don't understand this remark.  
The notion of "function marked as inline but in fact wasn't inlined"
simply isn't covered by any C(++) standard, and isn't detectable by any
C99 compliant program.  Hence a compiler understanding this extension
could still be c99 compliant (right now I don't know if "extern inline"
would be a invalid c99, if it is, then see below).
Perhaps you meant "shouldn't linux be compilable by a compiler which only 
is C99 compliant".  If you meant this, then I would say no ;-)  Think 
e.g. inline asms, which a purely (in the sense of providing nothing more) 
C99 compiler couldn't provide.  OTOH gcc with the right options _is_ 
mostly c99 compliant, so in this sense linux is already compilable by a 
c99 compliant compiler.
Ciao,
Michael.
