I'm quite sure -- an optimized build exits immediately, whereas I'm seeing a
hung process with 2.4 kernels that has to be killed (most any signal,
including SIGSEGV, will do the trick).  With 2.2 kernels, the program seg
faults, as it should.  By "Works here" I assume you mean that you received a
segmentation fault.
I get the same result with gcc 3.0.1 and gcc 2.96 (and yes, the relevant
generated code differs slightly).  I have tried Linus's official 2.4.13+UML
on UML, but I've not tried 2.4.13-ac8.
