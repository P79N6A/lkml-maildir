Hmm.  Memory or motherboard timings.  There are several options in BIOS
about this.  I'll try to experiment.  The only prob - it seems - is that
BIOS only allows INcreasing speeds (frequencies etc), not DEcreasing them.
More, the BIOS does not have CPU frequency control at all - only PCI bus
frequency and memory frequency.  Memory DIMMs are 667 MHz (PC5300), while
the mobo accepts 533MHz (PC4200?), and are running at 533MHz (according to
BIOS).
But in any way, I'll try to experiment here.

Okay, running with mem=128m now, copying linux kernel source and
removing it, 10 processes in parallel.
So far, I see the same random SIGSEGVs - not from cp and rm, but from
"usual" suspect - man(1) command segfaults pretty frequently as before ;)

Wonder how to disable it... :)  I already turned off all power management
stuff in BIOS I was able to find.
Thanks!
