I've had a eepro100 for about six months, and I notice that, aside from the
fact that you cannot select it with 'make config' (I have to manually insert
CONFIG_EEXPRESS_PRO100=m into .config), it appears to only work as a module.
I don't know enough to debug past this point myself; hopefully it'll help
you ;-)
