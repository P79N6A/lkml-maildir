Well, that, plus you still have to deal with a lot older stuff.

When I dealt with this for another project, I found that the e820 data 
format is suboptimal.  It's better to treat it as a sorted list of 
(address, type) tuples (where type can be zero); the data from e820 can 
be fed into such a data structure and it cleans it up nicely.
