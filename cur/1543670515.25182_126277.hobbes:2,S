At 41 degrees C reported CPU temperature, I don't think so. Even if this
is off by, say, 10 degrees, it's still not a problem. AMD allows 90 degrees
for my CPU type (Athlon XP 1700+, Thoroughbred core).
Maybe I should add that "under load" in this case means running OpenGL
games using DRI on a Voodoo4 card.

Beats me as to what could be wrong. It's not a memory problem and the
CPU does not overheat.
I'll go patch the kernel for my personal use then, but I'm not the only
one seeing those messages without any system problems.
