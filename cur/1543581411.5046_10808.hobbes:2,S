Whilst I admit sendmail is a horrible monster which I hope never to
deal with again; I wonder why you claim performance if better on OSs
other than linux (presumaby you mean comaprable hardware and
configuration)?
In my experience, sendmail performs no worse under linux than
elsewhere and sometimes better (asynchronous metadata writes
suspected to be the cause, not verified)
