Subject: [PATCH 0/7] Start using sysctl paths in the core kernel code
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The patches from Eric, that add support for so called ctl_paths
has recently being accepted, so I hope we can start using this
very useful feature.
To begin with, I switched the core kernel code to use the paths.
The rest code to be patched (after this set) will be:
 * arch-specifi,
 * some filesystems,
 * networking.
After this set the total vmlinux size decrease is ~500 bytes:

The set is prepared to fit the 2.6.24-rc3-mm2 kernel with Eric's
patches concerning sysctls.
