Well, anything that acts as a memory barrier, occurs frequently or
can be made to do so, and can be monitored.  For the inital user
thread implementations I used unix signals (pthread_kill).  Worked
ok on OS X but pretty much tanked on Linux.  So no signals as a
common unix user thread implementation of this.  It would have to be
/proc type information that would let you infer the threads in question
had done something that synchronized memory.  I don't mess around in
the Linux kernel so I can't make any specific suggestions there.
You're the expert there.

Right, the memory ordering on 6 means the updater is guaranteed to see
the hazard pointer set if it has a valid value.

Setting the hazard pointer to NULL requires release semantics to ensure
prior accesses to the element complete before the element is deleted.
That's an MFENCE on Intel, membar #StoreStore+#LoadStore on sparc, and
lwsync on powerpc.  Or you could wait an additional RCU grace period
to ensure those prior accesses complete before deleting the element if
you have RCU set up to track memory synchronization.
RCU "read" access is kind of like a lock.  And when you release
a lock, you need release memory synchronization semantics to prevent
accesses occurring outside of the critical region, the end of which
in this case would be defined by the store of NULL into the hazard pointer.
Additionally if you replace any non NULL hazard pointer value you will  
need to use
release semantics.
There might be something you can do to avoid the extra RCU wait but
I'd have to study it a little more to get a better handle on the
trade offs.

It's not the interrupts per se that are of interest here, it's the memory
synchronization.  If interrupts are a problem, you could always find  
something
that does synchronization in a more orderly manner, or put explicit memory
synchronization in the interrupt handler to force exactitude for this  
particular
case.

I suppose I should do some kind of formal analysis of this.  I'm figuring  
out
if this technique is interesting enough first before I go through all that  
work.
