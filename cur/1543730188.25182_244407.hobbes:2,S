No, NTP is a different protocol altogether. NTP runs on top of IP.
IEEE-1588 runs on the side IP and needs at least support in the driver
layer - if not the hardware layer!
NTP is supposed to be used over the wide area network. IEEE-1588 is for local 
area networks - mostly ethernet. NTP relies on IP for routing to
other networks, IEEE-1588 relies on "boundary" clocks between the
networks, i.e. the routers have IEEE-1588 implemented.
Take a look at

(Ethereal is mentioned as understanding IEEE-1588 :-)
