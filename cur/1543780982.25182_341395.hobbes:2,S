Problem:
o They are translating the drivers (about 66% is done, dma and pio are
close to be done) but in order to close claim for broadcom they don't
create divers. This guys will release documentation. See chinese wall
method on wikipedia.
o They post on this list 1 year and a half ago no answer.

o They need more programmer for reverse engeenering effort and
different programmer for writing the drivers from the documentation.
Actually 10% take about 3 months. For the courageous people, they
don't reverse directelly from asm but from C. In fact as mips asm is
pretty simple they can translate asm to C.  Nethertheless, it s
spagetty code and variable are referenced by pointer.
Reverse engeenering is therefore:
     - transform goto in for loop or while loop
     - transform *(phy+1054) in : int error or something like this.
o Testing perhaps in the end of year
Moreover this drivers will support all kind of broadcom card as the
drivers look like to be common
