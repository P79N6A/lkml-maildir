this is not the issue.  the issue is that volanomark is specifically
designed to create unrealistically long runqueues.  the question is 
whether there are real applications (NOT volanomark in loopback mode)
that have many thread which only synchronize with themselves, and 
do not spend most of their time blocked on IO.
the normal case is short runqueues, so a low-latency scheduler 
is the right optimization choice.  if it becomes clear that some 
real apps are causing long runqueues, we can add code.
