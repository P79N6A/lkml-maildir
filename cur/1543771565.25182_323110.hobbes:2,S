Can you be more specific?
Maybe a short chunk of psuedo code?

Sorry - only uses different IRQ handlers for MSI-X support.
But it could do something different for MSI IRQ handlers as well.

I think you misunderstood my question.
The driver uses dev->irq as a "token" to register *some* IRQ handler.
If the driver wants to register "tg3_irq_nommioread()" for the
MSI case and "tg3_irq()" for Line Based IRQ case, how would the
driver know which IRQ handler it should register?
The arch IRQ support knows the difference and currently returns
that status in the pci_msi_enable() call.
