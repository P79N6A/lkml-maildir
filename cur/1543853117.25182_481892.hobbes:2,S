Subject: [PATCH] WAN: DSCC4 driver requires generic HDLC
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Another thing, reported recently to me by several people - DSCC4 WAN
driver now (and perhaps for the last couple of years+) requires the
generic HDLC. I've fixed the Kconfig and moved the DSCC4 option
under CONFIG_HDLC so it's consistent visually.
Jeff, Francois, I think it's safe to apply. Thanks.
