And you will filter out 
- all messages from Hideaki YOSHIFUJI,
- most bug reports from Japanese people.
I don't think it's the right method.
The better way is to filter out all messages which are really encoded in
iso-2022-jp (or similar charsets), even if there's no proper header inside.
Any suggestions ?
BTW, why 90% of SPAM on the list is in Japanese ... ?
