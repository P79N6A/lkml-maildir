Subject: [Suspend2][ 10/10] [Suspend2] Atomic restore highlevel routine.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/6/27/93

This routine essentially duplicates the swsusp_resume routine, which does
high level steps of the atomic restore. Rather than modifying that routine
to include a number of if (suspend2) else clauses, it seemed better to put
a suspend2ised version here.
