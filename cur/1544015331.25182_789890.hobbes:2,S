I don't really expect a big difference, even if the filesystem is
intended for flash, not disks.  Other overhead will dominate the
picture.  The situation may be different for Johannes, though.

A million was picked because a) it is easy to calculate with and b) it
is sufficiently (insanely) large to illustrate the effect.  It is not
likely at all in my case.  With 1000 elements, which is much more
realistic, you can just halve the numbers above.

Maybe and no.  The overhead for near-empty or completely empty trees is
fairly low.  At one point in time I had one btree for every indirect
block and every inode in the filesystem.  As a result, struct btree_head
contains just two pointers and an int.
One key difference is that rbtrees maintain the tree within objects and
btrees maintain the tree externally.  So btrees have to allocate memory
on insertion, where rbtrees have the necessary memory as part of the
object.  With mempools the memory allocation should be reasonably safe,
so maybe this is a bit of a red herring now.
Another difference is the locking.  The current implementation
completely ignores locking and depends on the callers to serialize
access to the btree.
Keeping all that in mind, I believe many rbtree users could be
converted.
