Then I guess you'll get killfiled by a lot of people. I don't like
bk's licensing either but I'm not going to whine for months about it.
Linus knows how people feel about it and he's made a decision to use
bk anyway. People have tried to change his mind, and they have failed.
If you have a problem with bk, please just ignore it. Send diffs the
old way. Why not pick on Microsoft or Adobe? When you complain about
Larry trying to steal 10% of your data (wtf? Linus still releases
regularly. I don't see how we have any less data than before even
without BK), you're wasting your energy and annoying the huge fraction
of people who read this mailing list who don't care what software
Linus or anyone else wants to run.
The only thing that gets on my nerves is when people don't bother to
make GNU patches available. If Larry is able to turn the diff exporter
on eventually, this should make the problem almost moot. To someone
who doesn't use BK, people posting changesets would essentially just
be hosting their patches on bkbits.net. And if they want to host them
there, who am I to tell them no, no matter how they get there or what
format they're stored in internally?
