I don't mind the functionality, but what I'd like to avoid is adding lots 
of little config targets, so what I'd like to add is something more like 
'make queryconfig', which maybe even could be extended to some simple 
scripting functionality.

for_all_symbols() would be simpler and avoids possible duplicate menu 
entries and I think it's better to just test for s->name.
