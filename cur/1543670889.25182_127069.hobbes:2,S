I use 0x000001f0 (absolute) for relocating virtual disk code
for booting embedded systems. After Linux is up, the code remains
untouched. This might be a good location because the BIOS doesn't
use it during POST/boot and Linux (currently) leaves it alone.
Of course, this doesn't mean that somebody will not destroy this
area in the future (probably to spite you and me!!!).

Why is the government concerned about the lunatic fringe? Think about it.
