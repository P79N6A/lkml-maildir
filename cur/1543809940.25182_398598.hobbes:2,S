Swap? 128M was my first attempt -- OOM when the box was heavily loaded.
IIRC no effect on swsusp - there are 64M Ram + 2M Video + Kernel + X?. 
The reason I did it were some google results talking about free pages.
There were some solutions talking about adding swap.
(Ram? Would be the way to go, but it's fully loaded.)
