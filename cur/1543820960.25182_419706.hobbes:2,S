Not all :) Let me explain.
Until you provided something more complex then numtasks, this 
infrastructure is pure theory. For example, in your infrastracture, when 
you will add memory resource controller with data sharing, you will face 
that changing CKRM class of the tasks is almost impossible in a suitable 
way. Another possible situation: hierarchical classes with shared memory 
are even more complicated thing.
In both cases you can end up with a poor/complicated/slow solution or 
dropping some of your infrastructre features (changing class on the fly, 
hierarchy) or which is worse IMHO with incosistency between controllers 
and interfaces.
Thanks,
Kirill
