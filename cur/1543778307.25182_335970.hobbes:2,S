You must be more specific here; cached memory isn't always dirty. Most
of the times the pages used for cache are clean and can be evicted
quite fast and of course without writting anything to the disk.
If you want to tune the balance between "pages used for programs" vs
"pages used for cache" that's another problem, but I can't find a
reason why kernel shouldn't cache things when free memory is
available. And certainly that's not what Ashley was asking.
