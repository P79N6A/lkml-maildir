Improved attempt:
DESCRIPTION 
	This call copies data between one file descriptor and another.  The
	descriptor from which data is read cannot be a socket but must
	correspond to a file which supports mmap()-like operations. in_fd
	should be a filedescriptor opened for reading and out_fd should be a
	descriptor opened for writing. Because this copying is done within
	the kernel, sendfile() does not need to spend time transfering data
	to and from userspace.
