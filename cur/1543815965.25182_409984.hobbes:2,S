Because most parts of hpet.c were orignially written on an emulator
and were so buggy as to be effectively unusable until recently.
Additionally, there aren't many BIOSes out there that manage to
initialize the third HPET timer (the one used by these ioctls)
correctly, or that bother to enable the HPET device at all.  (This
seems to be changing due to the Windows Vista logo requirements.)
