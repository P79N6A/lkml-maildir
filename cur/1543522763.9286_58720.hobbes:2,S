ok, fine, but the above still has a limit of the argument to kmalloc <128K
which is around 131 million descriptors - I suppose that ought to be
enough for everybody... This is a theoretical limit as kmalloc()s of
individual chunks will start failing much sooner (when the total causes
fragmentation high enough for a single chunk allocation to fail).
Thanks for your suggestion -  here is the **fds implementation:

Does Alan have any preference or are we all working in the wrong direction
and he prefers kmalloc/vmalloc split (or some other) idea?
