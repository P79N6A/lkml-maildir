Yes, I don't trust the BIOS very much under normal conditions,
so I wouldn't even dream of running it with a largely undefined
system state. I'm actually quite surprised that kexec has so
few problems doing that :-)
In any case, since the kexec kernel code is more or less just a
generic loader, this is something you can always decide to
change in user space. The only thing bootimg did that kexec
doesn't do is to explicitly mark BIOS-provided data tables
(mainly SMP stuff) as reserved so that they won't be
overwritten. But it seems that mpparse.c now reserves that
already, so kexec should be fine.
