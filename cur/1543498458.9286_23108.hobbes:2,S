Subject: [PATCH] Oopsable bug in __prefix_lookup_dentry() on mips and sparc*
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/1999/6/9/180

	__mips_lookup_dentry() (and its relatives on sparc) pass
LOOKUP_SLASHOK to lookup_dentry(). It has no effect unless
	* /usr/gnuemul/ exist and
	* /usr/gnuemul/{irix,sunos,solaris}/ doesn't.
Assume that it is the case. Now, any lookup on /foo will give an oops:
1)	we are calling lookup_dentry("/foo", whatever, whatever).
	name == "/foo".
2)	we see that *name=='/'. Trimming the leading slashes leaves us
	with name == "foo".
3)	__prefix_lookup_dentry happens. It's a macro, expanding to
	dentry = __mips_lookup_dentry(name, lookup_flags);
	if (!IS_ERR(dentry)) return dentry;
4)	we are calling __mips_lookup_dentry("foo", whatever); which does
	base = lookup_dentry("usr/gnuemul/irix/", dget(current->fs->root),
			LOOKUP_FOLLOW|LOOKUP_DIRECTORY|LOOKUP_SLASHOK);
	if (IS_ERR(base)) return base;
	base = lookup_dentry(name, base, lookup_flags);
5)	First lookup_dentry gives us a negative dentry of /usr/gnuemul/irix
	(if we didn't pass LOOKUP_SLASHOK we would get ERR_PTR(-ENOENT);)
	and we are calling lookup_dentry("foo", negative_dentry, whatever);
6)	... which calls permission(NULL, MAY_EXEC). Oops.
Proposed fix: remove LOOKUP_SLASHOK from the __mips_lookup_dentry().
Results:
* If the process is not running with PER_IRIX32 - no changes, relevant
call never happens.
* If /usr/gnuemul/irix exists or is unreachable - no changes,
LOOKUP_SLASHOK has no effect.
* If the name doesn't start from / - no changes, relevant call never
happens.
* If the name consists of several slashes - new variant will give us the
root, current one gives the (negative) dentry of /usr/gnuemul/irix.
* If the name consists of several slashes followed by something else - new
variant will give us expected result (lookup of the rest of name from
root), current one gives an oops.
In other words, removing LOOKUP_SLASHOK from __mips_lookup_dentry() is the
right thing - in all cases when it changes behaviour of lookup_dentry()
it fixes a bug.
The same applies to __sparc_lookup_dentry() and __sparc64_lookup_dentry().
