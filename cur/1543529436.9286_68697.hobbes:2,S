no, it doesn't, but i now have a suspect -- bash. [v1.14.5(1) linked w/ libc5]
why this didn't occur to me when i noticed init=/bin/bash didn't
work either i have no idea :)
As i don't see bash using any sysvmem, i'll have to investigate further.
[were there any changes to mmap() semantics?]
[turns out bash (ie the dynamic linker) gets killed with a SIGBUS, after
 it maps a zero-length "/etc/ld.so.preload"
   [...]
   stat("/etc/ld.so.preload", {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=0, ...}) = 0
   open("/etc/ld.so.preload", O_RDONLY)    = 3
   mmap(NULL, 1, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE, 3, 0) = 0x4000b000
   close(3)                                = 0
   [SIGBUS]
 hmm, it seems the mmap() succeds and ld.so goes on and accesses that
 one byte. (the sequence is the same on 2.3.47p3, but the SIGBUS never
 happens)

[ahh, temporarily removing that file finally gives a bootable system.]
