It does sound a little bureacratic for this point in development.
The first thing we need is a set of widely-understood guidelines.
Such as:
Only
	- bugfixes
	- speedups
	- previously-agreed-to or in-progress features
	- totally new things (new drivers, new filesystems)
Once everyone understands this framework then it becomes easy to
decide what to drop, what not.
So right now, sysenter is "in".  Later, even "speedups" falls off
the list and sysenter would at that stage be "out".
Can it be that simple?
