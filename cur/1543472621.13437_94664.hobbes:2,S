Horrors, no!
99% of the core files we're interested in where I work come from remote 
sites running 24*7 operations, if a debugger started out there nobody would 
know what to do with it.  They don't even have source out there.
Instead we eventually get the cores over the net or by other means so we can 
figure out the problem at some later time.
The world is not just a single-user desktop..
