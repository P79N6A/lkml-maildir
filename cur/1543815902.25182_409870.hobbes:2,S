So far it seems like that option solves the problem. But since the bug appears 
very erratically I think it's better to wait for a few more reboots.
BTW, when I was testing _without_ ec_intr=0 I got this in the log (this 
happened the first reboot after the one mentioned in my previous mail):

This is an hp pavilion ze5616ea laptop, FYI.
Thanks and best regards,
