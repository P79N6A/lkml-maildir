ditto.  here's a few other things i've run into recently:
it should be possible to use cp(1) to load large datasets into a 
hugetlbfs.
it should be possible to use ftruncate() on hugetlbfs files.  (on a tmpfs 
it's req'd to extend the file before mmaping... on hugetlbfs it returns 
EINVAL or somesuch and mmap just magically extends files.)
it should be possible to statfs() and get usage info... this works only if 
you mount with size=N.
