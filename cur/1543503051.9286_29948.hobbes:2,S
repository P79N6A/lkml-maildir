The NFS is very important to us. That is why I spend my time on it. We
need a stable NFS client and server with file locking. I have beeen
running NFS tests and benchmarks for my NFS package. That is how I
found those bugs. I have to have a working V2 NFS before touching
V3 stuff. Unfortunately, NFS is not the only project I am working on.
I cannot spend much more time on it before V2 is solid. It looks like
V2 is very close. I will make a V2 NFS server presentation at LinuxWorld
Expo in August. After that, hopefully I can start working on V3 stuff.
Before that, if you want a working kernel with stable NFS, you can try
VA kernel. We have been beating it to death on our hardwares. It seems
to be very solid to us.
