Thank you all for your replies.  Disabling the SCSI
reset helps much, but not enough.  I ended up loading
a RAM disk to start key binaries to fulfill this
requirement, afterwards I then load the aic7xxx module
and pivot_root to the real root.  My biggest problem
is
the BIOS level resets and POST.  Thanks for your time.
Regards,
