All of these calls to schedule_timeout() are broken. You must set the
state appropriately before calling schedule_timeout() or it will
return immediately. For your reference here is the difference between
the two states with respects to calling schedule_timeout() directly:
TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE: sleep, waking up early on both signals and waitqueue events
TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE: sleep, waking up early on watiqueue events
Keep in mind that if TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE is used, you *must* be
prepared to handle signals (check return value, indicating an early
return, and signals_pending(current), indicating whether the cause of
early return is either a signal or waitqueue event).
Also, as a final consideration, because of the way the loadavg is
calculated, a TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE sleep will factor in as a 1 to the
load.
