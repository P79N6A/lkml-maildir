Depends on what you are used to.  I'm used to both, being both an old-world 
C programmer from the very beginning (where underscore was the preferred 
way) and also a Pascal programmer (where the mixed-case form was the 
preferred way).  Remember a language where dollar signs broke up words?
But then again, one reason I'm so fond of structures is that you can get 
away from the whole thing by being able to read
        d.hash.mask
        d.hash.shift
(It's really too bad that you can't have structured enum constants, isn't it?)
By the way, just so everyone hates me, I would tend to key the above two 
names as
      DHash_mask
      DHash_shift
so that, as another person has commented, you identify the class of a 
variable and the specifics as easily identifiable entities.  That assumes 
that your "class" names are sufficiently different that a mis-key will be 
caught by that master of book-keeping, the compiler.
