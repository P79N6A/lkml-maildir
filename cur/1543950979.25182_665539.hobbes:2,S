Subject: block: send disk "change" event for rescan_partitions()
Userspace likes to get notified that the disk may have changed, when
rescan_partitions() is called after partitioning or media change. It will
make it possible to update the state of the disk with the "change" event,
before the following partition "add" events are handled.
