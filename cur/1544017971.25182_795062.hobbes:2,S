I guess that is not a clear answer, so lemme try again:
The relay code is only used if the old method of starting a blk trace
and setting up filters is used, i.e. the IOCTL method.
When we use the sysfs interface to do that we do not use the relay code
at all.
But most of the rest is shared.
Except for things like __trace_note_message and the interface provided
by the old blktrace code to insert annotations into the stream.
That will be provided by using standard ftrace methods such as
/t/trace_marker, as demonstrated by:
[root@f10-1 ~]# cat /t/trace_pipe & echo "bye, bye relay" > /t/trace_marker
[1] 1090
[root@f10-1 ~]#             bash-957   [000] 14727.302000: 0: bye, bye relay
