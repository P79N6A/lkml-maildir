"All programmers are blind, especially me."
You are right, Jarek.  I ran this through gcc, and the following
comes close:
#define rcu_assign_pointer(p, v) \
	({ \
		if (!__builtin_constant_p(v) || (v)) \
			smp_wmb(); \
		(p) = (v); \
	})
But I am concerned about the following case:
	rcu_assign_pointer(global_index, 0);
	. . .
	x = global_array[rcu_dereference(global_index)];
Since arrays have a zero-th element, we would really want a memory
barrier in this case.
So how about leaving the index-unfriendly version of rcu_assign_pointer()
and adding an rcu_assign_index() as follows?
							Thanx, Paul
