Ted misread my posting. What I'm saying is that once you mounted it
several times you are in for races. You can forget about the dir->i_sem
protection, since the semaphore is associated with inode and you have
different inodes in different instances. _VFS_ is (ab)using the existence
of dir->i_sem serialization and it's part of the problem. You have to rely
on revalidate and I'ld recommend you to look at the namei.c::cached_lookup.
Notice the behaviour of dcache.c::d_invalidate on directory inodes.
BTW, the same thing goes for devfs_unregister() - order of invalidation
matters since you may block in between (i.e. big lock doesn't help).
Richard, stuff around ->d_aliases/d_invalidate()/->i_dentry/->i_count/iget()
is a large painful mess right now. Most of filesystems do not notice it,
but those who go for invalidation usage are stumbling into this mess.
Especially if they support links. Doubly so if they can be mounted several
times. It's a VFS problem compounded by several misuses of ->i_dentry that
block more-or-less obvious fixes. Sigh... The fact that i_sem is used for
dcache protection also doesn't help.
Could we please take it into email or on fsdevel?
