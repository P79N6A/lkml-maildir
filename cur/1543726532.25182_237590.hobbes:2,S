Ok, so it's a little broken, but the idea is to expose the rom as a file 
in /sys/devices/pciDDDD:BB/DDDD:BB:SS:F/rom just like config space.
I think I need to use pci_config_write_byte to enable option ROM address 
decoding, but even then I'm taking a machine check on my test machine, so I'm 
obviously doing something else wrong too.
