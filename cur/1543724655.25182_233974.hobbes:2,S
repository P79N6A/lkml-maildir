Do you have a pointer to the brainwave?

For now we can do it with an ioctl, and we pretty much have to do it for 
pvmove.  But that's when user space drives the kernel by syscalls; there is 
also the nasty (and common) case where the kernel needs userspace to do 
something for it while it's in PF_MEMALLOC.  I'm playing with ideas there, 
but nothing I'm proud of yet.  For now I see the in-kernel approach as the 
conservative one, for anything that could possibly find itself on the VM 
writeout path.
Unfortunately, that may include some messy things like authentication.  I'd 
really like to solve this reliable-userspace problem.  We'd still have lots 
of arguments left to resolve about where things should be, but at least we'd 
have the choice.
Regards,
Daniel
