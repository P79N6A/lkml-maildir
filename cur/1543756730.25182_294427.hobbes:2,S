i was hoping for a test that's a bit more granular.  might it be
possible to disable suspect bits of the acpi code instead of all of it?
i'm open to applying and testing patches.
disabling all of acpi for a week or 2 (sometimes my notebook will go 
4 days of daily suspending and resuming without trouble, now) doesn't 
sound like fun.  i like acpi events and information.
my latest test is to trim my suspend script.  from earlier versions of
the swsusp code, i had been disabling laptop-mode, turning swappiness up
to 100%, saving the hwclock, etc.  having taken all that out, i find it
unnecessary anymore.
