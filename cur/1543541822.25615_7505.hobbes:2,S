I hope this isn't true. :(
IBM says the drive does 15.5-18.7 MB/s. 
http://www.storage.ibm.com/hardsoft/diskdrdl/desk/ds25gp.htm
IBM also says that a similar drive that only does ata33 has a sustained
throughput rate of 12-16 MB/s.

My hdparm results (14.8 MB/s) are right in the middle of the ata33 range,
and remain exactly the same when switched to ata66.
I also found a post from Andre refering to these drives as being crippled
to ata33 but fixable. :)
here is that post.

It a sign that things aren't quite right :o)
I know this is a performance thing and you guys must be busy, so if you
want to back burner this issue until later (after 2.4 maybe) thats cool.
But, I really don't believe I am getting my money's worth from these new
drives that I bought specifically for there ata66 capabilities. Are there
any other tools or utils I could use to confirm I am maxing out the
drives?
Thanks for your time,
Shane
