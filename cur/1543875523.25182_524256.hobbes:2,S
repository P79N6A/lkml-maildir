Not that clameter really needs my help, but I agree with his position
on several fronts, and advocate accordingly, so here is where I'm at.
From prior experience, I believe I know how to extract positive results,
and that's primarily by PTE caching because they're the most frequently
zeroed pagetable nodes. The upper levels of pagetables will remain in
the noise until the leaf level bottleneck is dealt with.
PTE's need a custom tlb.h to deal with the TLB issues noted above; the
asm-generic variant will not suffice. Results above the noise level
need PTE caching. Sparse fault handling (esp. after execve() is done)
is one place in particular where improvements should be most readily
demonstrable, as only single cachelines on each allocated node should
be touched. lmbench should have a fault handling latency test for this.

Full eager zeroing patches not dependent on quicklist code don't crash,
so there is no latent use-after-free issue covered up by caching. I'll
help out more on the i386 front as-needed.
