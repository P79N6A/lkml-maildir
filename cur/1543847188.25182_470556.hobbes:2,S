Well, it wasn't attached, but I can simulate it.
invalidate_complete_page() wants to be called from inside spinlocks by
drop_pagecache(), so if we wanted to pull the same trick there we'd need to
pass a new flag into invalidate_inode_pages().
It's not 100% clear what the gfp_t _means_ in the try_to_release_page()
context.  Callees will rarely want to allocate memory (true?).  So it
conveys two concepts: 
a) can sleep. (__GFP_WAIT).  That's fairly straightforward
b) can take fs locks (__GFP_FS).  This is less clear.  By passing down
   __GFP_FS we're telling the callee that it's OK to take i_mutex, even
   lock_page().  That sounds pretty unsafe in this context, particularly
   the latter, as we're already holding a page lock.
So perhaps the safer and more appropriate solution here is to pass in a
bare __GFP_WAIT.
