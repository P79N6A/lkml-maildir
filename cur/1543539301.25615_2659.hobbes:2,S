Greetings,
	I am having problems compiling 2.2.14 through 2.2.16 with
Megatrends MegaRaid controler support. It worked with a patched
version of 2.0.38. Also using the Slackware-7.0 MegaRaid disk
I cannot create partitions. Again, Slackware-3.4 patched for
MegaRaid works. Most of the errors show up in compilation as
variables not used, or not initialized. I can send more if needed.
ANY thoughts or ideas will be considered.
TIA - Andy
