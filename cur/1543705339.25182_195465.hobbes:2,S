Could you disable accessing /dev/port if running on a 2.6 kernel?
If the controller is in MUX mode it can disturb it rather badly. It's
wrong anyway, because if the user has an USB keyboard, and in the case
of a legacyless system it'll even try to access nonexisting hardware. 
The problem is that when you're in X, and root, the ioctls will fail,
but /dev/port will still work, and cause trouble.
I'd even vote in favor of ditching the /dev/port code completely,
because all reasonable kernels support the ioctls, but that's your call.

Btw, what would you think about having the setkeycodes and kbdrate (and
possibly some other tools, too) take an optional argument of
/dev/input/event#, and then use the EVIOCSKEYCODE ioctl and EV_REP write
to set the scancodes and repeat on that single device? It'd be very
useful if one has more than one keyboard in the system.
