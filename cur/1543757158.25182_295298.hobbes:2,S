Gaack...  My apologies - I've seriously underestimated the amount of RL
crap, so no, it won't be ready today.  I'll try to do that ASAP, but I can't
make a good estimate of how much I'll be able to do during the next week.
Crap...
OK, let's do it that way - send the stuff my way, I'll port it if needed
and if there are duplicates, your patches win.  FWIW, stuff in fs/* is
	* a bunch of patches in fs/reiserfs/* (carved up, see R[0-4]-* on
ftp.linux.org.uk/pub/people/viro)
	* nfs, nfsd, lockd and net/sunrpc along with them (not carved up
into sane form and that will be needed to even start talking about merge)
	* compat_ioctl.c (part of i2c annotations)
	* fs/hostfs/* (part of UML patches, so that'll a part of further split
once the things stabilize a bit)
	* couple of trivial ones - procfs (duplicate of your patch) and
ncpfs (ncp_request_reply.sign made be32[6])
	* include-ectomy in a lot of places, but that's not likely to clash
with your stuff.
Most of the mess is in drivers/*, arch/* and (for endianness patches) net/*...
