Peter, I have 2.6.3gentoo r1 on my box with a A7N8X Deluxe v2 with Ross
Dicksons 2.6.3 idlec1halt patches and its as stable as a rock. I've left
it on that kernel as there are still many discussions recently posted re
2.6.5. My 3 other PCs are on gentoo dev source 2.6.5 and are solid, but
I've left the Athlon on 2.6.3 due to the fact its working just fine now
