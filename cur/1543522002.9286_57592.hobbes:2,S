The only problem in what you are suggesting is that you may end swapping
out also the wrong pages. Suppose you want to allocate 4k of DMA
memory. Why should the machine swapout lots of mbytes of data while it
could only swapout 4k? And after each swapout we have to restart from the
vma because to swapout we have to drop the pagetable lock and so the
mappings can be changed from under us.

The swapout will be definitely more balanced but we may end doing not
necesary swapouts.
