It should be cheap, yes, but it will require a fundamental change in the
VM: currently, all swap cache is readonly.  No exceptions.  To keep the
allocation persistent, even over write()s to otherwise unshared pages
(and we need to do to sustain good performance), we need to allow dirty
pages in the swap cache.  The current PG_Dirty work impacts on this.
