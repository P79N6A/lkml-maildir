You would only lock a single higher order block. Truncate works on that 
level.
If you have 4 separate pages then you need to take separate locks and you 
may not have contiguous memory which makes the filesystem run through all 
sorts of hoops.

The patch is not about forcing to use large pages but about the option to 
use larger pages. Its a new flexibility.

They are really larger. One page struct controls it all.

The patchset would reduce complexity and making it easy to handle the page 
cache. Gets rid of the hacks to support larger ones right now. Its 
straightforward, no new locking, very much a cleanup patch.

No it becomes easier. Look at the patchset. It cleans up a huge mess.
What is hacky about it? It is consistently using larger pages for the page 
cache and it integrates nicely into the VM.

We are currently looking dumb and unable to deal with the hardware. Yes 
we can pressure the hardware vendors to produce hardware conforming to our 
specifications but I always thought that was how another company operates.

It is the most consistent solution that avoid the proliferation of further 
hacks to address the large blocksize.
