Hi,
I've uploaded my drivers for RISCom/N2 HDLC card (ISA bus)
to 
ftp://pm.waw.pl/pub/Linux/hdlc/hdlc-1.0-pre1.tar.gz.
 This archive
includes generic HDLC support routines (currently only DTE/DCE Frame Relay
with ANSI or CCITT LMI is available, not counting IP-in-HDLC "raw" mode).
I'll work on integrating this support with the one provided by syncppp.c
and by other Linux ppp implementations.
The N2 hardware driver should work with SDL RISCom/N2 single or dual
port cards, and will not work with integrated CSU/DSU/DDS. There is no
SMP nor non-Intel support yet (is it even possible to use this card in
non-Intel machine?).
Of course, your comments are welcome.
