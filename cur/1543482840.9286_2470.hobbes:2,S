This is getting to be a very common posting/answer sequence here.
Does anybody else think it would be a good idea to have a warning
message for menuconfig or xconfig that appears when ext2fs or elf binary
support are modularized that says something like:
  WARNING: Most systems will not boot if ELF binary/EXT2 filesystem
  support is not in the kernel.
These two in particular seem to be the most common user goofs that show
up like kernel problems.
