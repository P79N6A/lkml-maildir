To be honest i didn't care and knew about that this could be an problem 
until now. But the biggest part of the acpi interrupts seems to happen 
while the first minutes, maybe while booting because with 22 min. uptime 
i get these values:
           CPU0       CPU1
  0:     413784          0   IO-APIC-edge      timer
  9:      14544          0   IO-APIC-fasteoi   acpi
24 min. uptime:
           CPU0       CPU1
  0:     435875          0   IO-APIC-edge      timer
  9:      15247          0   IO-APIC-fasteoi   acpi
26 min. uptime:
  0:     470428          0   IO-APIC-edge      timer
  9:      16251          0   IO-APIC-fasteoi   acpi
So let's say approximatley 700 to 1000 acpi interrupts in 120 seconds. I 
guess this sounds better, doesn't it?
