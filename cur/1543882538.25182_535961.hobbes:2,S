update for lkml readers: this is some really 'catastrophic' condition 
triggering on your box. Here ogg123 just never skips on an older 750 MHz 
box, which is 4-5 times slower than your 2GHz box - while i have _fourty 
nice-0 infinite loops_ running. I.e. at this clearly ridiculous load, at 
just 2.5% of CPU time ogg123 is just chugging along nicely and never 
leaves out a beat.
i'll try to figure out what is happening on your box. I asked for your 
.config off-list (which you already sent me) and i'll try to reproduce 
your problems. One thing i noticed: when ogg123 plays with 'esd' also 
running on the system, it starts skipping really badly - but it does so 
under all schedulers i tried (cfs, sd, vanilla).
