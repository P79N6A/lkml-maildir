Regarding the contest responsiveness benchmark (
http://contest.kolivas.net
)
I've made a minor update to 0.35. The main change is that it does one extra
kernel compile before each actual test. This pretty much washes away the effect
of previous loads that were running, and starts off every benchmark on the same
footing in terms of what is cached in ram.
