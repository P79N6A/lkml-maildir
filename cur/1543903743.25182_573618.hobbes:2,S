Thank you for your time.
I want to give some lame excuses, still:

a left-over.
first prototypes of drbd have been around in linux 2.0 time...
"in the old days", as a block device, you had to define this,
and then include some header after that.
will clean that up.

right.
but how to I tell a network thread in tcp_recvmsg to stop early,
without using signals?

I want to be able to do a rate-limit per specific message/code fragment,
without affecting other messages or execution paths.

I just recently cleaned up the use of them.
when the first drbd prototypes have been developed
it was linux 2.0 times...
along the way many things have changed in incompatible ways,
so we had to abstract it in macros.

unlikely to happen "right now".

No. This is not to allocate anything, but defines the chunk size with
which we transmit the bitmap, when we have to.
We need to be able to talk from one arch
(say i586) to some other (say s390, or sparc, or whatever).
The receiving side has a one-page buffer, from which it may or may not
to endian-conversion.
The hardcoded 4096 is the minimal common denominator here.

guess we have to explain first what this is for.
it probably is not exactly what you think it is...
but maybe I am just too ignorant about what you suggest here.
we'll have to defer discussion about this for when I'm done
doing the trivial fix-ups, and provided an overall design overview.

it had performance improvements somewhen.  I doubt it has still.
maybe we just remove this.

uhm. basically you are right.
Phil will take over to explain why it is done that way...

it is user configurable.
it is just the upper cap on user configurability.
most other points I just snipped off of this mail
will be handled as you suggested asap.
