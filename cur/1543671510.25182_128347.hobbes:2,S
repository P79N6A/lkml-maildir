It would only be used if we ever performed a hardware task switch
back to the kernel's default TSS. However, it's clearly wrong.

For now no, since the only task gate ever taken (double fault), never
returns (you don't want to update the TSS's CR3 field on every 
switch_to() so you would have to do it in the task gate return 
path, as well as having a correct LDT field).
However, returning from a task gate is so much fraught with races wrt 
segment registers that the best thing to do is to avoid it. Read out 
the details on how segment registers are reloaded on a hardware task 
switch to convince yourself.
