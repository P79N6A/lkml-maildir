Currently, the old stable tree will be supported for several years even 
after the new stable tree opens (2.0 and 2.2 seem to be quite dead today 
and might even miss several security fixes but 2.4 is still 
well-maintained). If you use a 2.4 kernel today you know that you can 
follow 2.4 for the next year without risking big breakages.
With the new dev model, I assume noone will maintain a 2.6.8 tree for 
several years.
