Found it, without this corresponding change to xf86-video-intel, this
breaks utterly:

    Fix G33 GTT stolen mem range
    G33 GTT table lives in seperate stolen mem with
    graphics data stolen mem.
I think this should be reverted for 2.6.23, it certainly doesn't seem to have
been appropriate for 2.6.23-rc6.
