It is a bug to let a program refuse to be debugged.

Eh, "vmid"??? I hope you don't intend to define a process as a
set of tasks which share exactly one address space. If you want
a real process ID, it ought to be shared by tasks that share _any_
other attribute not normally shared by distinct processes.
Example: if two tasks share file descriptors, then they can not
be considered distinct processes.
