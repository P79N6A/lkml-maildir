I thought that the bug might happen when two kernel modules are being loaded. If module A is loaded and its code includes references to functions exported by module B, I thought module A could call those functions before the module_init function of module B has finished. I was not thinking about buggy calls to registering interface functions. I just thought that the kernel should not allow symbols exported by   EXPORT_SYMBOLto be visible to other modules before the module_init function is finished. One could code the exported functions so that they could be safely called by anyone while the module_init function is being called but that would be an unnecessary burden for coders. I think that a module should expose its functions and variables only by calling registering interface  functions before the module_init function is finished. So I think the design of the kernel modules is flawed if it allows anyone to call exported functions before the module_init
 function is finished.
