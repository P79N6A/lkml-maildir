Thanks for the code.
In LinuxBIOS,
I put usbdevice_direct.c in lib/, and call it from usb2_init in
mcp55_usb2.c
Got 
"No device in debug port"
Waiting for cable, hope to get that cable next Tuesday.
Will create usbdebug_direct_console.c in console/ for linuxbios_ram
code.
also usbdebug_direct_serial.c in pc80/ for cache_as_ram.c
