+ * This unit implements all the UBI user interfaces: kernel interfaces,

+ *
+ * There are two kinds of character devices: UBI character devices and volume
+ * character devices. UBI character devices allow users to manipulate by whole

+ * volume read and update capabilities.
+ *
+ * Major and minor numbers are assigned dynamically to both UBI and volume
