    I'll be the first to admit that having the #if followed by arch defines
    really sucks, and that asm/unaligned.h would be much cleaner if for no
    other reason than avoiding an unnecessary gotcha for someone porting a new
    arch.
    Unfortunately, this doesn't appear to work in all cases. I know from
    testing that the S/390 case will fail using the {get,put)_unaligned macros,
    since they are identical to a normal, unassisted assignment.
    I did kick around the idea of making those macros the default accessors for
    the deh_state member (which is the only place they're used), but it unfairly
    penalizes arches that don't need them.
    I'm open to suggestions.
