It is strange, but manipulation with the channel list (longer then 15 
items) in XAWTV made not only solide lock of the kernel, but also 
sometimes only crash of the USB driver or PS2 keyboard driver. I think 
there is (was - not with your patch?) something wrong in the kernel. 
Maybe some memory problem.
