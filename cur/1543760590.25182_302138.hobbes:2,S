Maybe its best to drop last_running_timer as Ingo suggested.
Replace the magic with a flag that can be set to stop scheduling a timer
again.
Then del_timer_sync may
1. Set the flag not to reschedule
2. delete the timer
3. wait till the timer function is complete
4. (eventually verify that the timer is really gone)
5. reset the no reschedule flag
