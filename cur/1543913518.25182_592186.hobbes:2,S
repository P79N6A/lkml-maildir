Hi Dmitry,
Thanks for your answer.

This "allows" more than "implies".

I agree that in general there is a single i8042 keyboard controller on
a system, but what prevents someone to build a system with several of
these (e.g. in a multi-console computer)?
I agree that "i80420" was a confusing name, but now that a dot was
inserted between the name and the id, it wouldn't be a problem to have
a device named "i8042.0", would it?

This isn't that easy. For a given kind of device, some systems might
have only one, it might even be strictly impossible to ever have more
than one by design, but other systems might not have this limitation
and may actually have several instances of said device. As we try to
make our drivers as platform-independent as possible, the drivers
themselves can't assume that only either scheme is used, they have to
support both.
