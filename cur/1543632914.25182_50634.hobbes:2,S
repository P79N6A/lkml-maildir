Try adding something like this on your
/etc/modules.conf
alias	char-major-81	bttv
options	bttv 	radio=1 card=56
options	tuner	type=1
the card, radio and tuner values are in the linux
source tree under
/usr/src/linux/Documentation/video4linux/bttv/CARDLIST
If you don't have the kernel's source, let me know I'll
send you thta file
