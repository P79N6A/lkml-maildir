Hey Andi,
I looked a bit better at what happens (by adding a bunch of printk's in
drivers/char/hpet.c) and it seems that read_counter(&hpet->hpet_mc);
always returns -1 and that causes the following loop in 
static unsigned long hpet_calibrate(struct hpets *hpetp)
to endlessly loop while having local_irq_save(flags).
do {
	m = read_counter(&hpet->hpet_mc);
        write_counter(t + m + hpetp->hp_delta, &timer->hpet_compare);
} while (i++, (m - start) < count);
count is 0xe9 and start and (m - start) is 0. 
What could be the reason that read_counter(&hpet->hpet_mc) is and stays
-1 ?
