The 2.4.12-ac6 crashed, too, when I killed the dd and cpio processes 
with SIGKILL. I got the extra scsi queue debug information on the console
but it was too much to write down. I now have a serial connection to
another computer and did "ln /dev/ttyS1 /dev/console" in the hope to be
able to save you all kernel output.
