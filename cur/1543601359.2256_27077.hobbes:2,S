Well, you might try ACPI and ask questions about that on the APCI
mailing list (see 
https://phobos.fs.tum.de/mailman/listinfo/acpi
 ),
maybe they know about a ACPI workaround (warning: ACPI is hairy).

I hoped that the dmi_scan.c patch would make the shutdown work so we
could differentiate between your laptop and that other Compaq laptop,
but unfortunately it doesn't. I currently don't know of a way to fix
your problem.
As a sidenote: Alan, would it be a good idea to have the DMI data
available in an easy way without having to ask people to edit
dmi_scan.c? Simple proc interface, or a kernel command line option, for
example.
