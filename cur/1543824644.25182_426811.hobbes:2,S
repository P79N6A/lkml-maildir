Consider this a "more assembly" request then. What about these reasons:
- C code requires a stack
You must access one page only and therefore you need to setup the
stackpointer somewhere. Requires assembly.
- We switch to a new page table, twice on x86_64
Requires assembly.
- Need to setup segment registeres and cr*
Requires assembly.
- You need to setup/clear registers before passing control
Requires assembly.

We would have to duplicate the segment handling code in our xen port
otherwise. It's no biggie, it's just a matter of a few lines of code.
Also, I feel that my approach with a valid idt and gdt is more robust.

Let me know which parts you think are good and we will implement and
review them bit by bit instead then.
