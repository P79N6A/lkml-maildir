2.2 had back compatibility support for old drivers that did this 2.4 does
not.
	readb() is for bus accesses after mapping with ioremap
	isa_readb() is a quick form for ISA bus which is always mapped
For main memory you want to use
	phys_to_virt()
to get the virtual mapping of the page. That will work for the BIOS page but
not for arbitary higher pages which may not even be mapped.
