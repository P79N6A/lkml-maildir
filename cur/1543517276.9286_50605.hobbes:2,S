Hello Robert,
if transparent proxying stops working and the process behind runs, then
probably the rule table has been changed.
If you're alone with the machine, do the following steps :
- Zero out all rule counters (ipchains -Z)
- watch the syslog (e.g. tail -f /var/log/messages)
- make a proxy connection try (e.g. lynx 
http://www.linuxwall.de
)
- after that failed, check the rule counters
    (ipchains -L [{input|output}] -v -n)
You see which rules triggered and see what syslog said.
With an analysis of those informations you should be able to isolate the
problem.
Also do a netstat -a -n to seee if the proxy is listening.  
For me a "salvation rule" was very helpful : 
  ipchains -A {input|forward|output} -j DENY -l
as the last rule in each chain logs every unidentified packet passed so
far.
Mit freundlichen Grüßen / king regards
