You have not considered what is supposed to happen when this
structure is embedded within another one.  What kind of alignment
rules apply in that case?  For example:
struct foo {
	u32	x;
	u8	y;
	u16	z;
} __attribute__((__packed__));
struct bar {
	u8		a;
	struct foo 	b;
};
That is why __packed__ can't assume the alignment of any structure
instance whatsoever.  Your __nopadding__ attribute proposal would
lay out struct bar differently in order to meet the alignment guarentees
you say it will be able to meet.
