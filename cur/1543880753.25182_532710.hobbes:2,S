The thing is, it probably depends *heavily* on just how much work the X 
server ends up doing. Fast video hardware? The X server doesn't need to 
busy-wait much. Not a lot of eye-candy? The X server is likely fast enough 
even with a slower card that it still gets sufficient CPU time and isn't 
getting dinged by any balancing. DRI vs non-DRI? Which window manager 
(maybe some of the user-visible lags come from there..) etc etc.
Anyway, I'd ask people to look a bit at the current *regressions* instead 
of spending all their time on something that won't even be merged before 
2.6.21 is released, and we thus have some mroe pressing issues. Please?
