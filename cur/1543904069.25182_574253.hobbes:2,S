Perhaps we can use this as a base for userspace-allocated memory.  We 
still have a kvm inode and address_space; but instead of calling 
kvm_move_to_swap(), we use the memory slot and virtual address offset to 
locate the underlying address_space and call that ->writepage().
So:
  kvm_writepage() removes any shadow page table references
  the underlying ->writepage() does the work of paging to the underlying 
store
We need to figure out how to avoid the underlying ->writepage() from not 
within the context of kvm_writepage().  Maybe have a page flag 
signifying layered address spaces?
[it probably violates fifteen different mm assumptions; I need to study 
that code]
An alternative would be to have kvm set a page flag signifying it has 
references to the page when it installs it in a shadow pte.  The mm 
would notice the flag and call kvm to clear it below proceeding with 
normal ->writepage().
