Greetings.  On a separate installation I am running RH 6.0/Intel w/
2.2.10.  From searching the mailing list archive, it is apparently
fairly well known that there are problems with plip and the 2.2 kernel
(Feb 1/8, 1999).  I have come to depend on plip.
Will plip be fixed in the near future, or will it die?
I will offer my help if it can be somehow used.  I confess my
programming in C is mostly limited to equations and the like, not
real-time apps.  (I'm a mathematician.)  However, I'm a fast study, and
like to solve problems.
TIA!
