Don't be silly, did any of the developers say, that he has spare time to
read your regression lists ?
Michal posted it to LKML with the relevant developers in CC including
the stable team, so they are in the loop for updates, which is a Good
Thing!
Hey, you did this yourself. It is a great help and as your lists did,
Michals list pointed me to a bug, which I would have missed otherwise. 
So what are you complaining about ? Folks stepped up and built a
regression list and posted it to LKML. What's wrong with that ?
