yes, I totally agree.  I'm not arguing that the current behaviour is OK - 
of course it should work with debugging enabled.  All I said is that under
normal circumstances a production system is not supposed to have debugging

of course. That is why debugging does extra checks, which are disabled 
in production use.  Unfortunately we missed one check...

Yes, this is what I'm doing for the iptables-1.2.6 release.  The current
-DNDEBUG stuff has historical reasons which are no longer valid.
