The Sun compiler did support the long long type before gcc did.
This is not a problem.
I get e.g.:
 ==> COMPILING "scsihack.o"
"/usr/include/linux/byteorder/little_endian.h", line 43: inline keyword applied to __le64: must be a function identifier
"/usr/include/linux/byteorder/little_endian.h", line 43: syntax error before or at: __cpu_to_le64p
"/usr/include/linux/byteorder/little_endian.h", line 45: operands must have arithmetic type: op "*"
"/usr/include/linux/byteorder/little_endian.h", line 47: syntax error before or at: *
"/usr/include/linux/byteorder/little_endian.h", line 49: undefined symbol: p
"/usr/include/linux/byteorder/little_endian.h", line 49: cannot dereference non-pointer type
"/usr/include/linux/byteorder/little_endian.h", line 67: inline keyword applied to __be64: must be a function identifier
"/usr/include/linux/byteorder/little_endian.h", line 67: syntax error before or at: __cpu_to_be64p
"/usr/include/linux/byteorder/little_endian.h", line 69: syntax error before or at: __swab64p
"/usr/include/linux/byteorder/little_endian.h", line 71: syntax error before or at: *
"/usr/include/linux/byteorder/little_endian.h", line 73: undefined symbol: p
"scsi-linux-sg.c", line 1152: warning: statement not reached
cc: acomp failed for scsihack.c
And it seems that yout proposal did point into the right direction.
After copying /usr/include/linux/types.h  to
/opt/sunstudio12/prod/include/cc/linux/types.h and removing all 
#if defined(__GNUC__) && !defined(__STRICT_ANSI__) 
...
#endif
stuff, I got cdrtools compiled using "suncc" and I did even get a woring 
cdrecord.
Thanks for the help!
