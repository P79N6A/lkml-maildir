How about my patches to use new transport error values and make the 
iscsi and fc behave the same.
The problem I think Hannes and I are both trying to solve is this:
1. We do not want to wait for dev_loss_tmo seconds for failover.
2. The FC drivers can hook into fast_io_fail_tmo related callouts and 
with that set that tmo to a very low value like a couple of seconds if 
they are using multipath, so failovers are fast. However, there is a bug 
with where when the fast_io_fail_tmo fires requests that made it to the 
driver get failed and returned to the multipath layer, but commands in 
the blocked request queue are stuck in there until dev_loss_tmo fires.
With my patches here (need to be rediffed and for FC I need to handle 
JamesS's comments about not using a new field for the fast_fail_timeout 
state bit):
http://marc.info/?l=linux-scsi&m=117399843216280&w=2

For FC we can use the fast_io_fail_tmo for fast failovers, and commands 
will not get stuck in a blocked queue for dev_loss_tmo seconds because 
when the fast_io_fail_tmo fires the target's queues are unblocked and 
fc_remote_port_chkready() ready kicks in (iSCSI does the same with the 
patches in the links). And with the patches if multipath-tools is 
sending its path testing IO it will get a DID_TRANSPORT_* error code 
that it can use to make a decent path failing decision with.
