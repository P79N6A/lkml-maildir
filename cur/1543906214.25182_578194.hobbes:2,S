just to make sure, how does 'top' output of the l + "lt 3" testcase look 
like now on your laptop? Yesterday it was this:
 4544 roman     20   0  1796  520  432 S 32.1  0.4   0:21.08 lt
 4545 roman     20   0  1796  344  256 R 32.1  0.3   0:21.07 lt
 4546 roman     20   0  1796  344  256 R 31.7  0.3   0:21.07 lt
 4547 roman     20   0  1532  272  216 R  3.3  0.2   0:01.94 l
and i'm still wondering how that output was possible.
