Bill, do you hvae measures for this?  I seem to remember PTX's impact
of PAE36 as being about 3-5% depending on workload.  Janet did one test
sometime back with DB2 that showed a net of no difference on TPC-H (PAE
slows things down, less memory pressure speeds things up) but Badari
just repeated with 2.5.62 or 2.5.63 and saw a larger degradation.
I'm wondering if some hardware is not getting correctly configured at
boot with with respect to MTRR's, perhaps...  I really wouldn't expect
a 10% impact from PAE and I don't have any consistent Linux measurements
to validate or invalidate that much impact.
