Strong point.

Undue work.  The current high-speed development model could be reused as
2.7's development model.  Since it's good enough to use on the stable
tree, it can be said that 2.7 will always be stable, and so it can be
released often.  Also, distributions/users can cling to 2.7 and use it
freely without worrying that it's an explosive dev kernel that will eat
their hard drives.

| yes it would be acceptable if 2.8 was expected only half a year from now.
Half year release cycle, as I said in my proposal[1], using a volatile
but usable tree (as 2.6 is now) instead of a flat out unstable tree (as
2.5 was) for the odd majors.  I think we can endure another 3 months of
the kernel acting up like this, and then freeze it January 31 and branch
it to 2.7 with the same behavior as it has now WRT patching and new
features; of course, that's not my call.

What's important here is to keep the current development model in
spirit.  It's obviously working if you can call a very volatile tree
"stable," so we shouldn't revert completely to stone-age methods; but
having a defined release cycle is easy if the development trees are
handled as 2.6 is now.

Dude, lots of crap won't boot 2.4.  Try booting Reiser4 on 2.4 (there's
no reiser4 for 2.4).
