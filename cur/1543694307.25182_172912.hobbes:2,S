Testing is not a problem.

I really doubt it.  Kernel CPU footprint is dominated by dcache misses.  If
-Os reduces icache footprint it may even be a net win; people tend to
benchmark things in tight loops, which favours fast code over small code.

Well there's only one way to find out if we'll hit that.  How's about you
cook me a patch which switches to -Os unconditionally and we'll see how it
goes?
