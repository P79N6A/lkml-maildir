Actually, it could potentially do something very useful - if you are
using a laptop, or other machine where disks are spun down to save
power, you might be swapping in data while the disk still happens to
be spinning, rather than letting it spin down, then having to spin it
up again - in that instance you are definitely gaining something,
(more battery life).
