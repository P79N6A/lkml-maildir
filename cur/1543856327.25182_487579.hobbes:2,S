 config ACPI_CUSTOM_DSDT
       bool "Include Custom DSDT"
        depends on !STANDALONE
        default n 
        help
          This option is to load a custom ACPI DSDT
          If you don't know what that is, say N.
config ACPI_CUSTOM_DSDT_FILE
        string "Custom DSDT Table file to include"
        depends on ACPI_CUSTOM_DSDT
        default ""
        help
          Enter the full path name to the file which includes the
AmlCode
          declaration.
these allow you to nicely build a DSDT into the kernel, so that it can
be used FROM THE START. Not as some of the hacks do, replacing the DSDT
code while it is running. (would you really want to replace a kernel
modules' code while it's running by some other version of the module? If
the answer is no, why would you want to do it to bios code... )
Now for distro kernels this is somewhat awkward, however that's only a
bit of glue away realistically; stick it in it's own section and objcopy
the right one into the vmlinuz isn't that big a deal....
