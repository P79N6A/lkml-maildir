i.e. 1.3% text savings from going to mutexes, and inlining them again 
gives up 0.5% of that. We've uninlined stuff for a smaller gain in the 
past ...

i'm highly doubtful we should do that. The spinlock APIs are 4 times 
more frequent than mutexes are ever going to be, still they too are 
mostly out of line. (and we only inline the unlock portions that are a 
space win!) Can you measure any significant difference in performance?  
(e.g. lat_pipe triggers the mutex fastpath, in DEBUG_MUTEX_FULL=y mode) 
the performance won by inlining is often offset by the performance cost 
of the higher icache footprint. (and ARM CPUs dont have that large 
caches to begin with)
