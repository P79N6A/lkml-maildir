It is.

Yes, but it still uses an IO scheduler.

In your first message you mentioned you were using an ancient 2.6.10
kernel. That kernel uses the anticipatory IO scheduler. Update to the
latest stable kernel (2.6.19.1 at time of writing) and it will default
to the CFQ scheduler which has a smoother writeout, plus you can give
your process a different IO scheduling class and level (see
Documentation/block/ioprio.txt).
