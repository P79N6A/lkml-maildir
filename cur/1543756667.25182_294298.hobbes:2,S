FYI
The atmel at76c651 frontend driver is used for the 
Sagem DBox2 Digital Cable Receiver. 
As all other parts of the dbox2 drivers are atm not hosted at kernel cvs but at
cvs.tuxbox.org you won't find any components in mainline kernel tree using this.
thus we are a hobby project - but even well known - there are not so many developer
available to make every kernel driver and other parts of it "kernel-style-alike". 
maybe there is more progress and kernel driver patching into mainline in the future.
we are having 2.6.9 running on dbox2 - higher versions are atm broken for support of
the mpc 823 architecture :/
removing this driver is not wanted.
