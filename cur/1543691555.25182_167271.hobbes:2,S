I've done some work on this for -ac. I thought 2.4.22 had enough stuff
to deal with it (at least for the non ACPI case). VIA v-bus cares that
both PCI_INTERRUPT_PIN and PCI_INTERRUPT_LINE are both set.

Do you have VIA 8233 or 8235 hardware ?

Check there is an analog cable fitted on the CD->Sound. Many new WinXP
boxes are shipped with XP configured to digitally rip the CD data and no
audio link cable. If so you need to pick a different CD player app or
fit the cable.
