No; the point of this piece of documentation is to tell people how to
work _without_ that patch. Because it is simple enough.

Take a look at that patch. It is seriously overengineered. This should
not need a config option, should not introduce new page flag, etc.
We already have perfectly working interface for excluding specific
addresses; maybe we need better documentation, and maybe kernel
commandline interface should be changed to be more user friendly, but
we certainly don't want to take the badram patch.
This excerpt should be enough:
