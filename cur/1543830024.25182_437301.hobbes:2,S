i think you might be missing that GFS does cross-node locking in 
readlink too. (OCFS2 does not do it because it apparently does not care 
about cross-node atime correctness here it seems.) So GFS simply cannot 
use generic_readlink()!
i'm all for enhancing vfs_readlink()/generic_readlink() so that local 
locking can be extended if needed, but otherwise this does not seem to 
be a merge showstopper to me. GFS simply implements something that 
no-one implemented until now. (i dont know how XFS's non-GPL binary-only 
clustering module does it, but i'd not be surprised if it defined its 
own readlink implementation too.)
