Here's a typical situation with medium load :

muser is a database application for a terminal based order mgmt system, where
this leads to a very annoying user interface starvation for about 5-10 seconds.
Obviously, this process (already running with nice -20) syncs often (probably
due to its age: we started using it at year 2 B.L.; 1989 on Bull DPX systems, 
oh well..).
I experimented with schedtool and ionice today, by boosting the suffering 
processes and degrading others. But the problem persists.
Could it be, that the write queue is simply too large?
Here's the the block stat of the offended device:
~# cat /sys/block/sda/stat 
 1912195    54104 161804644  9629427  1407367   111132 27530479 572302123        0 12852042 581945330
The "write ticks" value 572302123 looks suspicious, isn't it?
The raid system is a 3ware 9500 controller with 5 WD Raptor WD740GD-00FLA0 
drives in raid 5 mode. 
Any ideas are highly appreciated.
