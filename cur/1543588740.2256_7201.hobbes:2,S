struct instruction_t {
	__s16 code;
	__s16 rxlen;
	__s16 txlen;
	__s16 pad;
	__s16 *rxbuf;
	__s16 *txbuf;
};
This was it's always aligned and packed, regardless of compiler packing settings. This particular layout happens to work with 64-bit pointers as well.... (I'm assuming that __s16 is a signed 16-bit type).
You can move the pointers to the front, but it's not necessary in this case, so I tried to preserve some of your original ordering (code first, rx before tx).
