That's somewhat overly aggressive.  My ISP experience is that customers'
mail server frequently crash over the weekend or holiday, so they stay
down for a few days.  I've seen mqueue with several 100,000 emails a few
years ago after a long weekend, today the numbers are probably even
more lethal.  Everything handled by sendsnail, btw ...
