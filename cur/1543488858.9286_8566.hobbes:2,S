Re: We apologize for current construction at our website. Many updates

    to share the following most requested information!!
Subject: 
As requested by so many of our visitors we have decided to share
how we increased our profits by 239%. Not only did we increase our 
profits, but we also saved 20 hours a week doing our mailings and 
newsletter. (If you are involved in MLM this program was made for 
you.)
The software is called Mailloop. Not only is this one of the most
powerful programs of its kind. It is also the easiest to learn. You
can download FREE step-by-step video instructions with your Mailloop
program. These videos are done in Lotus ScreenCam 97. That means you
do not need any special software or plug-ins to view them. You can't 
afford to pass up this opportunity! 
It's an email extractor, mailbox processor, and best of all a 
Newsletter Server. Mailloop is what sent you this Newsletter. 
Best of all, it did it while I slept!!!
