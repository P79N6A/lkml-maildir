I have to agree with Erich here.  Node distances make sense, but adding
'cpu distances' which are just re-exporting the node distances in each
cpu's directory in sysfs doesn't make much sense to me.  Especially
because it is so trivial to get a list of which CPUs are on which node. 
If you're looking for groups of CPUs which are close, simply look for
groups of nodes that are close, then use the CPUs on those nodes.  If we
came up with some sort of different notion of 'distance' for CPUs and
exported that, I'd be OK with it, because it'd be new information.  I
don't think we should export the *exact same* node distance information
through the CPUs, though.
