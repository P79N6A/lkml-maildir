I haven't yet tested it (will do), but I'm sure it does solve the
deadlock in balance_dirty_pages(), if for no other reason, that when
the queue is idle (no dirty or writeback pages), then it allowes the
caller to dirty some more pages.
The other deadlock, in throttle_vm_writeout() is still to be solved.
