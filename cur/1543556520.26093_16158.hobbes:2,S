That bforget-inode patch ran fine on two machines for ten hours. One
was SMP.  The other was running the ATA guy's latest set of patches
including taskfile support.
The proposed FS changes are solid.
The third machine died horribly twice - recursive pagefaults.  Without
IDE patch.  This could be anything, including hardware.  Will investigate.
