This error looks somewhat different from the samples posted earlier.
This one is quite definitively a "bad sector".
It should also show up in "smartctl -a -data /dev/sda" (near the bottom)
if SMART was enabled on this drive at boot.
You could try reading that specific sector again just to make sure.
One way is to figure out how to use "dd" for this.
Another way is to use the "make_bad_sector" utility that
is included in the source tarball for hdparm-7.7, as follows:
   make_bad_sector --readback /dev/sda 474507
(when invoked as above, it does *not* "make" a bad sector; no worries).
If it reports an I/O error consistently on that, then the sector is
indeed faulty, and it's contents have long been lost.
You can repair the bad sector (but not the original contents) like this:
   make_bad_sector --rewrite /dev/sda 474507
