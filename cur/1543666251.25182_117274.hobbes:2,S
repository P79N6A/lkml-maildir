Don't do this. The whole concept of opening a device node for a device
which is _absent_, then doing magic ioctls on it to make the driver
probe for the hardware, is utterly bogus.
Fix it properly instead -- disallow opening of a /dev/ttySx node with
uart type unknown, and implement a proper way to tell the serial driver
'please look for a device _here_', via sysfs or something.
