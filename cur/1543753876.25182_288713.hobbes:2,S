Which glibc do you use? I have problems with glibc 2.3.4, kernel 2.4.x and
X / Xorg while executing the int10-code of X. glibc 2.3.3 works fine for
me. But I could find another posting, which describes, that there are even
problems with glibc 2.3.3 and kernel 2.4.x.
It's new for me, that there could be problems with kernelversions of 2.6, too.
Therefore, it would be really interessting to know, which glibc version
you are using.
Kind regards,
Andreas Hartmann
