I like this.  It's simple, its clean, and it keeps all the
information in one spot.  I think we can go a bit farther here
and add in a list of the .c files that enabling this feature
should add to the Makefile (per the current 
    obj-$(CONFIG_FOO)            += foo.o
stuff in the current Makefile).
