Thanks for the clarification!
I am safe as I don't usually use multiple targets, but I always compile with
KBUILD_OUTPUT set and make -j5 (and distcc).
However, some of the out-of-tree modules might break, will stay on alert.
A quick check through the relevant to my hardware ebuilds (/me on Gentoo)
showed no show stoppers, they all do:
for T in $TARGETS; do make $T; done
(MAKEOPTS=-jN is handled internally on Gentoo if configured; and I use
/var/kernels/out to compile my kernels)
Please get that patch into 2.6.15.2 if possible (seems many people have ppp
problems, so I guess that will be released soon).
Kalin.
