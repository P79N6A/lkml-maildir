Subject: [PATCH] net/ipv4/arp.c: Fix arp reply when sender ip 0 (was: Strange behavior in arp probe reply, bug or feature?)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/15/209

Fix arp reply when received arp probe with sender ip 0.
Can't find any ground in RFC2131 to send a non-valid arp-reply in
the special case of sender ip being set to 0.
- Bug fix for arp handling when sender ip is set to 0.
Send a correct arp reply instead of one with sender ip and sender
hardware adress in target fields.
Now sends target ip and target hw as received in arp probe.
