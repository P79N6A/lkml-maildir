err, good point.  _one_ of those dang things which goes off when you've
stayed up too late does a lot of pagecache IO, not sure which one.  Maybe
rpmq?  But I'd expect that to be doing direct-io.
But yes, updatedb's pagecache usage will be mainly metadata, and this tool
doesn't address metadata pagecache, although it could do so.
<does an updatedb on a modest system>
It instantiated 5MB of pagecache and 20MB of slab, took about one minute.
<runs all the other things in /etc/cron.daily>
rpm uses rather a lot of pagecache.
So yes, it looks like updatedb is a slab problem.
