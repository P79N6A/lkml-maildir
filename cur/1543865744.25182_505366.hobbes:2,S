For syscalls, sure.
The kevent work incorporates Uli's desire to have more data per  
event.  Have you read his OLS stuff?  It's been a while since I did  
so I've lost the details of why he cares to have more.
Let me say it again, maybe a little louder this time:  I'm not  
interested in worrying about this aspect of the API until the  
scheduler mechanics are more solidified.
