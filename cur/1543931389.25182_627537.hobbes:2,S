Hi,
The kernel build fails with following error message
drivers/char/hvcs.c: In function 'hvcs_open':
drivers/char/hvcs.c:1180: error: wrong type argument to unary exclamation mark
make[2]: *** [drivers/char/hvcs.o] Error 1
make[2]: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs....
This driver was broken in 2.6.24-rc4-mm1 either on powerpc, and the discussion
has been going on at
