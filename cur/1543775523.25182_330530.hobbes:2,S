Yep. The board uses a PLX PCI 9656BA chip configured for local-bus
transfers during DMA The local-bus is 32-bits from a FIFO. There
is no way to collapse these writes from the 32-bit source/dest.
The transfers are 32 quadwords for a write and 16 quadwords for
a read, but that represents a burst, not the data-width. Without
a 64-bit data-path to memory on one side, and a 64-bit data-path
to the device (a FIFO) on the other side, you will not get 64-bit
transfers.
