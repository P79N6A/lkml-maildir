Is it? I've sent a bajillion test messages to myself and they all ended up 
UTF-8, meaning it actually recursively encoded the original UTF-8 in the 
message.
I'm using alpine. Know any way to explicitly set another encoding such 
that it does -not- get converted on the other end? I tried the 
character-set and charset options but they didn't help at all.
