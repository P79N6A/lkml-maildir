Fighting with my backlog..
While being away from Linux for a while my kernel suddenly would not compile.
A make mrproper was needed.
This was no good and I realised that generating asm_offsets.h for i386 did 
not check all dependencies.
My fix involve all architectures and I want that pushed -mm before anything else.
And it get rid of the annoying print "asm_offsets.h is up to date"
I do not want to think what horor it could trigger if we change a constant and asm_offsets.h
was not re-generated when it should.
