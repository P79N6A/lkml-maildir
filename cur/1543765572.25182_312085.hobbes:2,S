My Linux SATA software/hardware status reports have just been updated. 
To see where libata (SATA) support stands for a particular piece of 
hardware, or a particular feature, go to
	
http://linux.yyz.us/sata/
I've still got several patches from EMC (Brett) and IBM (Albert) to go 
through, as well as a few scattered ones from random authors.
I'm still working in BitKeeper for the time being.
