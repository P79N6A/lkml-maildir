Whoever is "in charge" of Linux will need to seek legal counsel versed in
these issues. The U.S. has relaxed export control laws, and so export of 56 bit
DES is possible (I've done it), and legal, but only with an appropriate export
control license.
I can provide the name of a competent attorney, if anyone is interested.
It is possible to get export control licenses without legal assistance,
but it's no doubt easier to have a point person who works a few minutes
away from the relevant gov't agencies in the D.C. area.

The U.S. doesn't implement this part of Wassenaar.
