I have a similar problem with 'imm' module. There are a bug in kernel, but
when i mount the zip drive, mount fails and exit with error. But when I
install manually the module (with 'insmod imm') (the other modules are
already installed by 'mount'), the virtual console stop working. I
think there are also a bug in modutils caused by bugs in kernel. modutils
must fail without stop virtual console (as 'mount/kmod' do).
N.B.:
The imm bug will be corrected. In thread 'BUG iomega parport':

I think it is the same problem, with the same solution.
