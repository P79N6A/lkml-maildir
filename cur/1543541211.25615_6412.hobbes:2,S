Hello all,
bad news concerning HFS-formatted CD-ROMs:
Support seems to depend on the CD-ROM-drive (!!!).

The following is HFS' fault, and it can't be fixed quickly. 
In fs/hfs/hfs.h, you're plainly told:
/* various FIXED size parameters */
#define HFS_SECTOR_SIZE		512    /* size of an HFS sector */
#define HFS_SECTOR_SIZE_BITS	9      /* log_2(HFS_SECTOR_SIZE) */
In fs/hfs/super.c, the CD-ROM would be mounted:
/*
 * hfs_read_super()
 *
 * This is the function that is responsible for mounting an HFS
 * filesystem.	
[...]
*/
struct super_block *hfs_read_super(struct super_block *s, void *data,
				   int silent)
{
[...]
	/* set the device driver to 512-byte blocks */
	set_blocksize(dev, HFS_SECTOR_SIZE);
Trying to change the blocksize of the CD-ROM device ends up in function 
sr_set_blocklength() (for an SCSI CD-ROM drive at least), and this sits
in 
file drivers/scsi/sr_vendor.c, which name already tells everything.
Changing the blocksize to 512 can succeed, but it doesn't have to.
I wouldn't know about the prevalence of 512b-sectors-capable CD-ROM
drives
in the field...
So HFS formatted CD-ROMs can only be mounted in SOME CD-ROM drives.
This can't satisfy, but the fixed sector size assumption is woven too
deeply
into the guts of the HFS driver to be fixable easily.
On the other hand, this is the status of HFS as it has been all the time 
through v2.2. It's not a new v2.4-bug.
Please correct me if I'm, well, not correct ;-)
