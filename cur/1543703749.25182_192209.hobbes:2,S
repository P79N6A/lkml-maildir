Q: If one were to have to pick a "standard" place to assign
KBUILD_OUTPUT in the top level Makefile, where would it be?
In particular, Gentoo has been having problems with compiling external
modules against 2.6 kernels, as most of the time this results in
attempting to write to the source tree, and our sandbox system
preventing this and dying.
After smashing my head against the wall for about a month, I've been
working on a experimental system to *always* set KBUILD_OUTPUT, so
there's always a clean source tree to compile against using the
recommended "make -C /usr/src/linux/ SUBDIRS=/foo O=some/tmp/dir"
(setting O= without a clean kernel source tree just causes kbuild to
yell at you to run "make mrproper")
The details of this discussion can be found on our bugzilla here:
http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=32737
So, where would you put the "default kernel output"?
The general concensus so far has been /var/tmp/kernel-output/${KV} (KV
is the kernel version, e.g. 2.6.1-mm4)
Comments? feedback? "what a horrible idea"s ?
