The ioctls are in essence the unimportant part of the patch.  
The SCSI_IOCTL_START_STOP is unneeded since 2.1.100, where
SCSI_IOCTL_{START,STOP}_UNIT have been added. (Actually, they 
are defined right above of where you yanked in the START_STOP
ioctl.) The SD_IOCTL_IDLE is deprecated because you can easily
work around it in userspace[*]. For IDE disks this is already
done by polling /proc/stat.
The only really important part of the patch are the changes 
to rw_intr(): Unlike IDE, current implementation of SCSI disks 
takes it as a fatal error if a mounted disk is spun down. It's
basically
Kernel: "How do you do?"
Disk:	"NOT_READY."
Kernel: "Oh really? But, how do you do?"
Disk:	"NOT_READY."
and so on...
which the patch changes into
Kernel:	"How do you do?"
Disk:	"NOT_READY."
Kernel:	"Well, try to spin up then. How do you feel now?"
However, looking at the locking hassles the spinup code in
sd_init_onedisk() must endure, I get a feeling that the patch 
isn't waterproof on SMP, maybe neither on UP. It's on my list 
of "things to look at", but being busy... Anyway, unlike the
ioctls the spinup logic seems to me like a valueable addition
that should make it into the kernel. Then it would be possible
to extend the logic that's used in bdflush-1.6.2 for IDE disks
to SCSI as well.
Daniel.
[*] That's not entirely true. Due to limitations in the accounting
    used in /proc/stat, currently you lose with either more than
    4 disks or a mixed setup of IDE and SCSI disks. I have a working
    solution for that, yet still have to write a sensible user space
    application. The difference being that it's a generic approach,
    not one limited to SCSI.
