No. We bought a new disk and /usr partition was moved there.
That's why we got some free space on the old disk and since almost ALL of the
present partitions on the old disk was too small I must resize them.
So I backed up a partition I delete it, I create it with another size and
I restored. But I haven't got enough space to backup the partitions at
the same time so I did the procedure step by step. And kernel reports
the OLD partition table (fdisk w command reports busy disk) if I
did not reboot ;-(
[during the process I was on runlevel 1 and only root partition (which
was not resized but was on the OLD disk was mounted and it didn't allow
me to reread partition as you see ...)
