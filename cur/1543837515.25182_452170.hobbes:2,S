I think it will need something similar. I suspect the required changes
will all be confined to routines in inode.c. If the link count is
changed by (a) remote node(s), then gfs2_inode_attr_in() might change
the link count. Also gfs2_change_nlink() is the other place to look. I
think everywhere else is ok,
Steve.
