We already have similar problem with 64bit dma on Intel.
Namely, we need page_to_bus() and, moreover, we need 64bit bus addresses
for devices understanding them.
Now we make this in acenic like:
#if defined(CONFIG_X86) && defined(CONFIG_HIGHMEM)
#define BITS_PER_DMAADDR 64
typedef unsigned long long dmaaddr_high_t;
static inline dmaaddr_high_t
pci_map_single_high(struct pci_dev *hwdev, struct page *page,
		    int offset, size_t size, int dir)
{
	dmaaddr_high_t phys;
	phys = (page-mem_map) *
		(unsigned long long) PAGE_SIZE +
			offset;
	return phys;
}
#else
Ingo, do you remember, that we agreed not to consider this code
as "ready for release" until this issue is not cleaned up?
I forgot this. 8)8)8)
Seems, we can remove at least direct dependencies on mem_map
using zone_struct.
