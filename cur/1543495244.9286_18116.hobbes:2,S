I have a linux 2.0.30 machine acting like a gateway from network
195.61.144.128 to network 192.168.2.0. (195.61.144.205)
The 192.168.2.0 newtork is a ms-windows network. In that network there is
another linux machine (192.168.2.1) which is the local gateway.
I installed on this machine Squid2.2 and now I can browse the internetnet
from the ms-windows network (192.168.2.0).
Both linux machines runs pppd2.3.7 and the connection is stable. On the
gateway from the ms-windows network I declared the default route to be
like that:
		route add default ppp0 
Because that machine is also a WEB server, and i wanted to be visible from
the outside of the 192.168.2.0 network, that machine responds also at the
195.61.144.221 address. To achieve that I used:
pppd /dev/cua1 proxyarp modem crtscts 195.61.144.205:195.61.144.221 persist
, on the 195.61.144.205 linux machine.
The only connections that squid permits are http, ftp and https from
Netscape.
Does anyone knows how to let people from ms-windows network to read their
e-mail, to read news, to  use mIRC etc?
 Is there another way to do that in Linux?
