Again, shouldn't this just mean that recvfrom should not be called 
without the MSG_ERRQUEUE flag set?  From the above description, I read 
that select returning with an indication that a descriptor is ready for 
reading could mean that it has an error message queued to it, rather 
than in-band data.  If you then call recvfrom/recv/recvmsg without 
indicating that you want to receive the error indications as well, then 
isn't that just another example of improper coding, since recvfrom would 
have returned immeidately, as select indicated, had the appropriate read 
flags been set?
