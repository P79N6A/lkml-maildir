hi
                     I have some confusion regarding key in shmget(). Let I
have two shared memory variables. For the first one, I put key "99" and the
size is 1024. Next, I put key "199" for the second variable  and size 1024.
Will the two shared memory area overwrite each other. How can I gurranty. Is
the Linux kernel    or the developer who should care about this problem
