we did this in the Red Hat kernel, just as a quick hack to boost X without
having to modify X (bleh). While it worked very well in practice, it's a
really bad idea from an interface design POV, because it singles out X
mostly based on a random characteristics of X, but leaves out some other
tasks that are 'suffering' from not being recognized as interactive, but
still having a user watching them (and expecting keypresses to react
fast): games, xine, XMMS, etc.

yes, an ELF flag might work, or my suggestion to allow applications to
increase their priority (up until a certain degree).
