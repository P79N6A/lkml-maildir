Hi everyone,
I'm currently thinking of ways to hook system calls (PoC) in the linux
kernel 2.6.28. Based on a simple rootkit, which can be executed on the
2.6.23, i got an "oops.. unable to handle kernel paging request at
0x...", when i run it on a new kernel. Can anyone help me finding what
protection was added to prevent writings on kernel memory ? 
Thanks for your help.
Alex
