	Hi,
	Yes, the problem is in const TASK_UNMAPPED_BASE. The problem is
only for CONFIG_2GB and CONFIG_3GB. You can read my posting to the linux
kernel mail list on 10-DEC-1999 with the subject:
"Shared memory region > 1.4GB for 2.2.13+ (2GB x86)"
	There is a patch wich allows this value to be tunned using sysctl:
