Yes. But it is possible to reduce it to a practical minimal risk by using
a long enough really random filename and if this succeeds, to rename it to
the wished name.
For temporary files in /tmp which do not need a well known name it is probably
the best to just choose such real random numbers, anyway. This solves i.e.
often some denial of service attack possibilties. But this is my very private
opinion and this method seems not to be used often.
