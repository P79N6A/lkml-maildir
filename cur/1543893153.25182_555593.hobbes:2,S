I may not be able to contribute much testing soon, as this board is
moving out of this machine and I don't have another to put it into for
the moment.  After that it won't be my problem any more, but it'd still
be nice to have it fixed.
It's been bugging me for a while because it seems to be just a piece of
faulty memory management code (probably a bug in the DMA code), but it
hasn't been fixed in several revisions.  Oh well, I'm sure no one's
really looking, so it's good to bring it up and pull out the latest
debug data to say "Yes this is really still broken" once in a while :)
Interestingly enough, I haven't managed to get it to take down the
system since a while back (it used to hard-freeze the kernel).
