I have a Tyan S2892 board with a pair Opteron 288 dual core cpus and 
16GB dram. I receive the errors shown in the attached file, mcelog. It 
appears that these occur when the free memory becomes small, there is 
a lot in the cache, and a lot of IO.
The Tyan S2892 has an Nvidia Crush K8-04, which I think they call the 
southbridge. My errors appear to be related to the north bridge. There 
is an AMD 8131 PCI-X controller that runs the PCI slots. There is a 
3WARE 9500-12 located in one of the PCI-X slots.
I have run Memtest86+-1.65 for 24 hours without errors. I recently 
upgraded the BIOS to V2.00 without any remarkable changes.
I am running 2.6.15 within a current Fedora Core4 configuration.
I would appreciate any advice as to how to proceed. I have not noticed 
any adverse behavior from the mce's. But that could be masked is data 
transfered or ???.
Could there be any connection with the memory cache? Thanks in advance 
for your assistance.
