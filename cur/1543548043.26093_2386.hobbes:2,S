A further follow-up to my previous response to this...  Now I have
rebooted the old laptop under 2.2.17.  It was pretty ugly.  I suspect
(because this is what I've seen with incarnations of this problem in
previous versions) that the video hardware was still upset with
whatever happened with 2.4.0-test7.  A full shutdown/power off and
reboot cleared the problem.
Note that this problem has only appeared after rebooting from a 2.3.x
or 2.4.0-testx kernel without a full power down.  As long as I never
bring up a newer kernel AND do a shutdown -r, I don't have this
problem.
I'm a little puzzled that my previous response hasn't appeared on this
list yet but I've seen long delays before so I guess I shouldn't be
too alarmed.  Basically, it came down to noting that it's difficult to
move a video card from a laptop and that the problem seemed to have
gone away after I rebooted to 2.2.16 (though I recall now seeing some
corruption while it was booting, but nothing like the full-scale
lockout I had with 2.4.0-test7) -- the keyboard was usable under
2.2.16.

There are no physicists in the hottest parts of hell, because the
existence of a "hottest part" implies a temperature difference, and
any marginally competent physicist would immediately use this to
run a heat engine and make some other part of hell comfortably cool.
This is obviously impossible.
