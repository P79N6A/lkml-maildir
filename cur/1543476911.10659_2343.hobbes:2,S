I think RedHat's init scripts are maybe a little unreliable - I used to
get no end of troubles when I had an autofs directory from /home (on its
own fs).  Now they're all mounted from / and things seem a little better.

Whatever.  Anyway, I can reliably unmount my autofs'ed zip drive with
"eject -uf /dev/sda" under 2.2.0p6.  I don't use the CD drive much, but it
has worked in the past.
