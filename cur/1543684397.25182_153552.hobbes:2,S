Unfortunately no, however it is trivial to just add host->lock pointer
and make it point to io_request_lock. Ditto for q->queue_lock. That wont
change how the code operates at all. I will probably do that once 2.4.23
opens, it would make maintaining 2.6/2.4 drivers much easier (and ditto
for vendor kernels).
