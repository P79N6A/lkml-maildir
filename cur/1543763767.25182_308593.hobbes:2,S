Probably not the same thing, but on 2.4 I was noticing
large TSC jumps, the magnitude of which was dependent on CPU speed.
They were always around 1.26ms on my 3.4GHz dual HT xeon system.
That's (2^32)/(3.4*10^9) which suggested it was a 32 bit overflow
somewhere, which pointed me at:
http://lxr.linux.no/source/arch/i386/kernel/time.c?v=2.4.28#L96
This implied the TSCs were drifting relative to each other
(even between logical CPUs on 1 package).
I worked around the problem by setting the IRQ affinity
for my ethernet IRQs (the source of the do_gettimeofday()s)
to a particular logical CPU rather than a physical CPU and also
tied the timer interrupt to CPU0.
I guess I could also maintain a last_tsc_low for each CPU also?
