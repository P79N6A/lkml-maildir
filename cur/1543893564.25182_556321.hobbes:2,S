As long the device itself does the wear leveling, there could no specific 
answer here!
On MTD its the job of the filesystem to do the wear leveling because it works 
on the bare flash. But memory sticks, CFs and so on emulate a block device. I 
don't know a device where you could switch off its internal wear leveling 
mechanism. So it makes no sense to find the best filesystem for such a case. 
There is no best one.
Its the same discussion about protecting essential data on CF by using more 
than one partition. A first partition for read only (system), a second one 
also for writing (data). And everyone hopes in the case of a crash the read 
only partition survives. But CFs internal wear leveling does not know 
partitions and continuous to use *all* blocks on the CF for its job.
