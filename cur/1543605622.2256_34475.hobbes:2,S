Heh.  OK, so you've stopped me in the middle of writing RFC that proposes
addition of
MODULE_CONF(string)
that would put that string into separate section and making modules_install
dump these sections, feed them through s/_NAME_/`basename $module`/ and
cat them into defaults file that would go into $INSTALL_MOD_PATH.
MODULES_BLKDEV(), MODULE_LDISC(), etc. would be trivial wrappers around that.
Looks like the thing you mentioned would make quite a few people happy.
Might be worth doing in 2.4...
