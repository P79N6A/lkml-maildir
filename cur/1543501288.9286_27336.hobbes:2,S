Aha - so Hans want open() to work on directories only when app does 
open("/etc", O_OPEN_DIRECTORY_AS_FILE)
? That will not break anything, but I doubt it is better than
open("/etc#opendirasfile", O_RDONLY)
which has advantage of easily going through network, advantage of user
being able to explicitly ask for this even for old apps (think cat
/etc - how do you convince cat to use O_OPEN_DIRECTORY_AS_FILE? You
add option? And why adding option when cat /etc#opendirasfile works
nicer?)

PS: The latter complete with syntax has one advantage: it is already
implemented ;-).
PPS: Hans, please try not to change subject lines in every
posting. The whole thread is much easier to kill that way :-).
