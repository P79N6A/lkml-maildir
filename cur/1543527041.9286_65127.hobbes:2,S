Do you mean that you want to go above and beyond what ftruncate does?  If
that's the case, reading from /dev/zero is probably the easiest thing,
although I suspect doing a sendfile from /dev/zero to the file will
ultimately end up being more efficient.
If you are managed to do a read from /dev/zero into a shared file mapping
beyond the end of file without getting a SIGBUS, then that's a bug.

No, this is insanity.  Creating holes in the middle of files actually cam
up when talking about ext2 changes, and frankly it doesn't make sense. 
For example: on a filesystem that uses extents, creating a hole in the
middle of a file means that you might have to allocate more disk space in
order to free the disk space.

Or teach truncate about preallocation.

Remember that madvise is only giving the system hints about what you want
it to do.  If madvise allows you to mark a dirty page as clean without
doing a writeback, that could result in stale data residing in the page
cache for other users to come along and read without that data going to
disk -- not behaviour I want to see.  If read returns it, it should be on
disk.
