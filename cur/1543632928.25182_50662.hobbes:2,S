That's fine. That's exactly the same thing that happens with device
drivers you have compiled in but don't have hardware for and have hotplug
enabled. The fact that it's registered with the system simply advertises
its support.
The fact that it's unused and just sitting there taking up space is 
distasteful, but there are things that could be done about it. For one, we 
could compile PCI as a module and include it in an initramfs image (so it 
loaded early enough to not break too many things).
Or, after we probe for everything, we could make a sweep of all the 
drivers in the system and purge any that have a refcount of 1 (registered, 
but not used by anyone).
