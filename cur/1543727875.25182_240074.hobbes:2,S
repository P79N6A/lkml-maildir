Hmmm, as a Linux user who had been fighting with scsi emulation and
cdecord --scanbus for years, being able to use dev=/dev/hda is so much
easier and so much more in tune with the way the rest of Linux works. 
If you don't believe me, spend some time on irc channels like #gentoo or
#debian where people like me (and many others) give support to Linux and
cdrecord users from all over the world.
