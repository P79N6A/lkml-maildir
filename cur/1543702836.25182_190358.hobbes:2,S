I can try that with the 2 kernels, but it will have to be after amanda
is done with her nightly tour, which will take another 2.5 hours.  By
then I expect to be sleeping, or hope to be, its 1:30am here now.
Or maybe not, what do I do when "vmstat 1" prints its column headers and segfaults?:
---
[root@coyote linux-2.6]# vmstat 1
   procs                      memory    swap          io     system         cpu
 r  b  w   swpd   free   buff  cache  si  so    bi    bo   in    cs  us  sy  id
Segmentation fault
[root@coyote linux-2.6]#
---
cd'ing to /proc/1, and trying to "cat mem" gets me this:
---
[root@coyote 1]# cat mem
cat: mem: No such process
[root@coyote 1]#
---
Some of the other names there have content, but 'mem' seems to be
a truely empty filename, marked:
-rw-------    1 root     root            0 Jan 12 01:32 mem
but apparently inacessable.
This actually sounds pretty serious, and I did have a hard lockup
in the night last night, had to use the reset button, but I think
that was a cpu overheat, I'd run the heat up cause the missus was
squawking about being cold.
I've rearranged things airwise and got the cpu down to below 70C.
These AMD DX-1600 thoroughbreds really are genuine coffee boilers.
I really should replace it with the cheapest barton cored one, but
this ones been running that hot for 30 months now.  Running seti 24/7
of course doesn't help. :)
Do I need YANP42.6 (Yet Another New Program 4 2.6)?
Sorry, couldn't resist creating a new acronym. :)
