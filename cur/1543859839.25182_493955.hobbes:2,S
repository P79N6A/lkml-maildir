Multipath layer sets the new flag.
SCSI layer of an underlying device calls __end_that_request_first()
for a cloned request.  And original bios which were issued to a dm
device will be completed through the cloned request when no error
occurs on the clone.  When an error occurs, the completion process of
the bios are skipped.
