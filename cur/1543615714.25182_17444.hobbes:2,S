Red herring.  It's not very nice for *applications* to not indirect
through a driver, but if that driver is in userspace or kernel space
is irrelevant.  Incidentally, "applications" here include a lot of the
parsers that produce /proc output.  /proc/pci is occationally handy,
but it is also an example on why you shouldn't do data reduction in
kernel space unless you can avoid it.  Now /proc/bus/pci is available
and contains all the data, however.
