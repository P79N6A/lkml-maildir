OK, you correctly removed the one I was thinking about. You should also
remove other CONFIG_BLK_DEB_IDE* and CONFIG_IDEDMA*, because there is
also a generic PCI support for IDE controllers. Most probably your
drive has been detected on a generic PCI controller. At least, just for
a test, completely disable IDE to be sure, and enable ata_piix. As long
as you'll not see your disk as sda, it will not work.

I don't know, I'm a terrible loser when it comes to LVM unfortunately.
I just hope you're right :-)
