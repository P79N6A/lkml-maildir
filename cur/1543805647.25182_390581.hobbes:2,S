That all depends on what they are protecting their works against.
If they were protecting their works against illegal copying, that
protection should indeed not be circumvented.
On the other hand, if all they are "protecting against" is lawful
and legitimate behaviour by joe six-pack consumers, I do not see
why those efforts should be protected or helped...

It should also be noted that DRM does not protect works against
copying - the one thing that DRM was supposed to achieve.
