Hi all,
I am a new person in this area and have just started going through
documentation on NFS support in linux. I am trying to find if
connectathon tests have passed on NFS on linux 2.4. Can anyone give
me any information on that, or links to the information if any ?
Thanks for all the help,
- KK
