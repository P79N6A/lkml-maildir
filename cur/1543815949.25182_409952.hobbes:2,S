i have released the 2.6.16-rt5 tree, which can be downloaded from the 
usual place:
   
http://redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/
there's been quite some churn since -rt1:
 244 files changed, 1806 insertions(+), 1588 deletions(-)
this was mostly due to the simplification of IRQ-flag handling: 
local_irq_*() now defaults to using the raw IRQ flags. The 'soft 
irq-flag' code only had a debugging purpose, but that purpose is equally 
well suited by dont-schedule-while-in-atomic-section checks. This 
cleanup resulted in a nice 10% reduction of the -rt patch's size, and 
should make porting to architectures simpler.
another bigger change is the continued rework of the PI code by Thomas 
Gleixner: it should now be Bug Free (tm) - in particular the SMP locking 
deadlock noticed by Esben Nielsen should be fixed. There are also lots 
of updates to the PI-futex code too, by Thomas.
there are also lots of smaller fixes for regressions in -rt1.
to build a 2.6.16-rt5 tree, the following patches should be applied:
  
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.16.tar.bz2
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/patch-2.6.16-rt5
