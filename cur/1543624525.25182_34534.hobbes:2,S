Unfortunately, at least on my C800 here, not using it breaks IEEE1394:
    kernel: ohci1394_0: Waking dma ctx=2 ... processing is probably too slow
and communication breaks down shortly after (have to unload/reload the
modules to make it work again). On the other hand, with IO-APIC + Local
APIC enabled (APM and ACPI disabled) firewire works fine.
I note that W2K on the same machine appears to have no trouble using
both IEEE1394 and power management together. (I have booted W2K less
than ten times though versus half a year of linux use, so this may be
a false impression.)
