I guess the question could be phrased:
Which one is more likely to conclude at some point?
That is, if we blacklist by default, we consume that additional power 
indefinitely, because it is unlikely that people will report "my machine 
uses 200mW more than I think it should", and thus we are unlikely to 
build up knowledge of exactly which devices/classes should be blacklisted.
Compare that to:
"My USB printer broke, guess I'd better report it to LKML".
The first option is unlikely to ever reach a satisfactory conclusion, 
whereas the second one is quite likely to flush out the guilty parties 
within a relatively short time.
FWIW.
