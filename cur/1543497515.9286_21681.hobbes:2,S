But for the hardware I'm running this on, a checksum + copy takes at least
twice the time as a checksum (simple - read vs read/write). And this is
the main bottleneck. Sure, on a P2/400 this is not an issue but it is for
other systems, like embedded ones trying to run at 100 mbit/s.

Doesn't get rid of the unnecessary copying though.
