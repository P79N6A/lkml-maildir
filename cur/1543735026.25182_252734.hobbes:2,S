There is also something to be said for the embedded market here. 
offload chips are fairly usefull when building switches and routers. 
Dave M. in a thread just a few weeks ago provided some metrics for how 
much bandwidth a PCI-x bus and a some-odd-gigahertz processor could 
handle.  It worked that a pc with the right componenets could 
theoretically handle about 4 gigahertz nics running traffic full duplex 
at line rate.  Thats great, but it doesn't come close to what you need 
for a 24 port gigabit L3 switch, nor does it approach the correct price 
point.  Most of these designs use a less expensive processor running at 
a slower speed, and an offload chip (that incorporates tx/rx logic and a 
switching fabric) to preform most of the routing and switching.  For 
cost concious network equipment manufacturers, they are really the way 
to go.  Unfortunately, many of them don't actaully run as a 
co-processor, and so don't enable Jeff's idea very well (yet :))
