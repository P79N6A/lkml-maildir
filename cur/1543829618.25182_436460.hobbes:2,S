No they don't - as they likely didn't do before. e.g. Opterons generally
break and that brings the point across clearer.
The rationale is that CONFIG_NUMA is very rarely used on i386 (even on summit)
and always does bitrot quickly. It also doesn't work at all on a wide
range of machines.
I'm sure someone will bring up now an example where their non Summit 
machine booted with CONFIG_NUMA, but they were just extremly lucky
and unlikely to be for very long.
