Everything seems to be running stable with a Celeron 300 and a Celeron
333 in the same system. Just compiled a kernel (with make -j5 in the
makefile) and I had rc5 running at the same time. Linux seems to be
ok with it (don't have NT anymore).
If you can still get P2-400's, you shouldn't be messing with a P2-450
(or whatever). On the other hand, Intel specifies that both CPU's should
have the same spec number, which will be almost impossible by now...
It's kinda funny that the two CPU's have different bogomips ratings ;)
I wonder if a P2 and a Celeron on the same motherboard would work...
