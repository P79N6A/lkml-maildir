Albert, that would mean that single fscking pagein would be well beyond
the size of on-disk buffer and so platter->head transfer speed comes into
the game. Care to count the time? And that assumes that you don't have
other traffic. Now, since you rarely have 8Mb filled with the data you'll
get ~1e4% overhead on that stuff. For most of the processes it will mean
pure and simple *swapping*. And it buys you what? 256Gb? Sheesh... How
many processes have RSS>8Mb? Now each of them got at least 24Mb. Great.
Oh, and COW becomes *very* interesting exercise. So fork() becomes a
bitch. Great. exec() also looks nice - you have to do at least one pagein
to start execution. Oh, and while we are at it - what will be the size of
your swap?
F-. Really.
