Here it is.
Further I have a problem with booting the kernel on 4x dual core Opteron (HP585). It prints lot of panics on boot to console but not to the log. (without NUMA support it boots OK).
If you tell me how to get the first panic message I will sent it to you.
On HP385 booted with mem=3072M when I try to bind a program to node1 the kernel panics - again there are lots of messages. With 4GB it runs OK.
b.r.
