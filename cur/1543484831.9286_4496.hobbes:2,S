From schedule():
	...
        release_kernel_lock(prev, this_cpu);
	^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        /* Do "administrative" work here while we don't hold any locks */
        if (bh_active & bh_mask)
                do_bottom_half();
        run_task_queue(&tq_scheduler);
	^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	...
When do_tty_hangup() runs current->lock_depth can be easily >=0 and we
have the real spinlock unlocked so lock_kernel() does nothing and
do_tty_hangup() can race fine with the other CPU that is holding the lock 
now.
I hope I am not doing mistakes but so far I haven't seen anything in the
code that invalidated my theory.
Supposing that I am right, I don't know if do_tty_hangup() is supposed to
be run only from release_dev() and so I don't know if the real bug that is
causing this race is that run_task_queue(&tq_scheduler) is not run before
returning from release_dev(). But if do_tty_hangup() can't be run from the
scheduler, why don't we use a new task queue (tq_tty_hangup) instead of
tq_scheduler in first place?
Another little curiosity, why tty_hangup() exists and we don't use
tty_vhangup() for everything?
