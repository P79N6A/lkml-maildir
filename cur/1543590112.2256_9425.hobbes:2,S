Hello !
While working with RTL8139(C) based board I too often (5-10 min) get smth
like this :
Tx transmit timeout
Dirty Tx entry 001
---                  002
    ---              003
       ---           004
and than i need to restart interface to bring it really on (because, it
still not work after printk() smth Eth0 restarted)
Disabling MMIO don't give any results.
System:
    Chaintech 7AJA (VIA KT133, Latest bios)
    Duron 900
    Kernel 2.4.4 (8139too 0.9.16)
P.S. if I use old kernel 2.2.X and RTL81XX driver  I don't get this error
