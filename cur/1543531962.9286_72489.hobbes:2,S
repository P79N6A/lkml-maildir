I'm now testing Kanoj' balancing patch together with my kswapd
infinite-loop-removal patch. The system seems to work quite well,
I haven't seen any big strangeness in the VM load (the variance
in the amount of free memory is a bit bigger, naturally, but that's
to be expected) and interactive performance from the console seems
unaffected.
It would be nice if a few more people tested the combination of
2.3.99-pre3 with Kanoj' balancing patch and my infinite-loop-
removal patch ...   (because YMMV)
regards,
Rik
