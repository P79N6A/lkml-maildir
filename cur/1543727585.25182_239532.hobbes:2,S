fbdev is in exactly this model and it isn't causing anyone problems.
The simple rule is that if you want to upgrade fbdev past the current
version you have to do it in entirety. You do that for fbdev but
pulling bk://fbdev.bkbits.net/. But Joe user doesn't do that, that is
something only developers do.
Distributions release new kernels all of the time. If Joe wants to
upgrade he graphics driver he should wait until we push it into the
kernel and it arrives via his distribution. If he really wants to be
bleeding edge he can copy the entirety of the DRM CVS into his kernel
tree. 
Linux doesn't have a stable driver binary interface. It isn't meant for
you to be able to upgrade one module while keeping the core and an
older module.
The key here is that distributions release new kernels at a rapid pace.
This is not X where we get a new release every five years. The standard
mechanism for upgrading device drivers in Linux is to add them to the
kernel and wait for a release.  If DRM uses that mechanism for
distribution we won't have problems.
