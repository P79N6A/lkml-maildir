The problem is a big non-initramfs RAMDISK image (used for root mountpoint on this 
particular embedded platform), that is decompressed more than once:
- during the initramfs check, which fails because it is not initramfs.
- during the real RAMDISK decompression to memory.

So the issue is not the empty initramfs image (which BTW could probably
be made unecessary?), but a 10Mb RAMDISK image being decompressed by a
48Mhz PPC, which takes quite a few seconds.
Need to rework the patch to use a __setup option as Andrew suggested.
