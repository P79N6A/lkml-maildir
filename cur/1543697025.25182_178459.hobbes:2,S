Hi Davide,
Thanks for the response!
I guess you're asking did I check that the NMI counts were rising (i.e. 
they weren't staying at zero) and the answer, unfortunately, is yes - 
they were increasing steadily.
I checked exactly as you suggested using "cat /proc/interrupts".
Then, I ran X up and "boom", that's all she wrote :(
Best wishes,
Dan.
