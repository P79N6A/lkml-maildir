There are many meanings of NULL.
a) NULL -> I don't know
   Reaction: Ok, then do a generic/default variant.
b) NULL -> failure in caller passed down to us.
   Reaction: Pass it on, return -EINVAL or ignore the call
c) NULL -> failure in API (argument can't be NULL)
   Reaction: BUG_ON()
...
So the answer isn't only taste, it's a matter of simplicity and
roboustness.
