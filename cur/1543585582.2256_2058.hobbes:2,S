	Other zero initializations in inode->u certainly can be
removed, but whether it's worth doing or not depends is a matter of
taste (recall the flamefest around Tigran's crusade against global
zero initializers several months ago ;-)
	The rule is that inode->u is zeroed before fs gets to see
the inode, be it in ->read_inode() or after get_empty_inode().
The rest is private business of that fs. That's what ->u is about,
after all...
