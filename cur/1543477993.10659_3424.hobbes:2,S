IMO, the "cleaness" might be better described as "too simple."

I suggest that we should get rid of the (struct buf) complexity by 
creating the concept of temporary kernel mappings.  Such mappings
are a resource limited so that the system doesn't have to map all
of memory, yet have a cleaner, more consistant scheme than the current.
The vm_page_t's at the end of the struct bufs were only a first step
in that arena.  There are about 5-10 more steps needed before it is
really fully realized.

Yep, and it has been very difficult for me not to "educate" them on
the right way to do it.  Frankly, their code works really well until
it is overused.  Given the Linux VM code, "overused" mostly means
used at all. :-).

It wasn't hard to add to FreeBSD, but the coloring should be moved to
a machine dependent section of the codebase.

The key here is to NEVER swap out page tables or page directories.  One
should FREE them when it is possible.  The notion of a dirty page table,
or on that is on disk is meaningless.  The FreeBSD code releases page
table pages when they are empty.  Page directories should be freeable
when all descendants are no longer mapped (including page tables.)  Of
course, in that evaulation, the kernel mappings should be ignored, and
when "swapping" page directories in, they are rebuilt from the kernel
requirments.  (FreeBSD doesn't release page directories yet, unless
a process exits.)

IMO, the pmap level is super flexible, but also there is too much stratification
between the pmap code and the VM code.  Layering is good for reference
implementations, but also adds overhead.  It would be "nice" to be able
for the upper level VM code to simply modify page table entries sometimes,
wouldn't it?  One thing that I did in the FreeBSD code was to minimize the
transitions between the pmap and VM layers.  Perhaps that should be better
defined, but if you wanted to rework the interfaces, you might see a
major cleanup.

I agree.  Take a look at using a seperate kernel mapping concept (there
might even be some of that work still lying around somewhere.)  You can
then change buffers into what they should really be: I/O requests.  The
kernel mappings can be a dynamically allocated resource that are cached
LRU or somesuch.  Part of the technology to support them ended up being
pmap_kenter/pmap_kremove and pmap_qenter/pmap_qremove.  Without those, the
temporary kernel mappings would have been terribly expensive.

Note that Linux doesn't even handle IDE PIO correctly, and has historically
lost interrupts due to it (and they added a software interrupt scheme ot
allow it to work.)  IDE DMA saved their a**.
