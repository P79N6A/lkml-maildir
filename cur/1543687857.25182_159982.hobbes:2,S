ACPI was working well (powerdown) until 2.4.22-rc2 but was disabled for my 
bios in 2.4.22-rc3 because of the date of the bios. By using the suggested 
acpi=force powerdown works again.
Is there a list of known broken/working BIOS versions, because the bios
for the ASUS CUBX-L is working (for my use of ACPI)?

Everything is working as aspected, nothing prevents me from living on
the edge.
