The following is not a problem, but a question I have been unable to
answer by myself. Is with respect to the recent addition of "input layer
based support for infrared remote controls", mainly for use with TV
tuner cards based on bttv.
Gerd Knorr did the patch that was integrated into mainstream as
ChangeSet 1.1474.131.296, and I was trying to use the new standard
driver instead of the ported one from 2.4.x, which I got from LIRC
mailinglists, and has been working OK with 2.5.x and 2.6.x.
If I load the new kernel modules ir_kbd_gpio and ir_common I get in the logs:
ir-kbd-gpio: bttv IR (card=41) detected at pci-0000:00:0b.0/ir0
And from /proc/bus/input/devices:
I: Bus=0001 Vendor=1461 Product=0001 Version=0001
N: Name="bttv IR (card=41)"
P: Phys=pci-0000:00:0b.0/ir0
H: Handlers=kbd event3 
B: EV=100003 
B: KEY=c304 80100040 0 0 30000 0 2008000 80 1 9e0000 7bb80 0 0 
So everything seems to be detected OK. But when I start lircd 0.6.6-7,
it seems to come up fine, but as soon as any application tries to get
keypresses from /dev/lirc the daemon exists, because of:
could not open /dev/lirc
So it seems the new kernel driver for TV capture card based remote
controls doesn't use /dev/lirc as the place to "send" events from which
applications read them.
I have downloaded LIRC from CVS (0.7.0pre1), tried to compile it with little 
overall success, and started "lircd --device=/dev/lircd --nodaemon".
Next I started "irw" to show "keypresses" on the screen, and the daemon
doesn't complain, but nothing seems to be received neither.
So the question is, is something unusual needed to make the remote work
with the recently added ir-kbd-gpio.ko ?.
Greetings.
