Hazardous.

Hmm.. could be fun if somebody is calling 'open', and the UTF-8 encoding
requires the insertion of extra characters to encode it - what do you do then?
That looks like a security hole just waiting to happen.  Probably has lots of
lurking corner cases too - what if you creat() a file, then do a readdir() and
strcmp() each entry looking for your file (while comparing a filename smashed
to UTF-8 to the original unsmashed string)?
