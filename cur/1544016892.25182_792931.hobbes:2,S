It turns out that this patch isn't sufficient.  Additional changes are 
needed, as posted here:
	
http://marc.info/?l=linux-usb&m=123196296431175&w=2
In principle these two patches should be combined into a single one.  
Unfortunately the new patch has not yet even been submitted for 
mainline, let alone accepted, so it can't go into a stable kernel.
