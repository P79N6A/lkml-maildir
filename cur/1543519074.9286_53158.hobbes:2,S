It doesn't have anything to do with the shell.
You have some kernel experience. Ever used "make menuconfig" in
/usr/src/linux ?? Find out how that works (hint:
/usr/src/linux/scripts/lxdialog/)

I've never set anything in my .inputrc, yet "dialog" and "lxdialog"
(and tons of other programs) happily show nice lines and boxes even

Try "make menuconfig". And be amazed ;)
