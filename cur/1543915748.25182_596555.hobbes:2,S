"not been discussed" because it was sent to lkml -
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/9/22/60
- and it got missed/left on the floor during the arch/blackfin inclusion 
(which was huge), not because of any deliberate malicious intent on our part 
to mislead or try to get this in now by doing an end around as you are 
implying.
Our mistake for not poking everyone/resending things sooner/before 
arch/blackfin was included. Bryan will try to make sure that doesn't happen 
again (right Bryan?) - like he is now, by poking/resending things, and making 
sure that the appropriate maintainers (like you, if we are changing things 
you maintain) are included. (which is what I think the problem was).
If we can focus on the technical merits of things, rather than how we got 
here - which I agree sucks - was our mistake - we are sorry - we will try to 
make sure that it doesn't happen again - I think it would be time/effort 
better spent.

BTW - does anyone know Miles Bader's current email address? There isn't one 
listed in MAINTAINERS - and he is still listed for the NEC V850?
