The ones I remember were:
- alsa-lib, as mentioned
- ipsec-tools/openswan needed updating when the kernel changed
   to require forward SAs
- a old script on an earlier release needed fixed when usbdevfs finally
   went from being deprecated to dead
SELinux changed froom 2.6.early to 2.6.current as well, IIRC.
