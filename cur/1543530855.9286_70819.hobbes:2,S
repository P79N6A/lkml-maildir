That side effect is nice, but the patch itself is ugly.

Using this even for non-modular case? Take a look at acm.c driver, how
this is nicely possible. Oh, and you better hide partition_module.c
into some header file, and add "PARTITION_MODULE(name)" onto end of
each partition module, instead of using ugly including of C files.
