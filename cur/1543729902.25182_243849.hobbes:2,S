o.k., you're right.  this time it's really -P5 :-)

tried it with the options, no success.  built a kernel without
powermanagement and without cpu speedstep at all.  exactly the same
behavior, directly after unpacking the kernel at the beginning of
startup:
0 MB highmem
511 mb lowmem available
ACPI RSDP .....
.....
ACPI build 1 zone list
Detected Processor...
Memory ...
...
Checking if processor honors the WP bit even in supervisor mode... ok.

that's it.  freezes for 1-2 seconds after this last message, then
reboots.  tried to write down these contents of the screen, as far as
i could recognize them during the short period of time.
i am wondering especially about the ACPI messages, as ACPI is
completely switched off now.
second (minor) issue: when having enabled CONFIG_PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY(=y)
but not CONFIG_PREEMPT_TIMING(=n), i get the following when linking:
  LD      init/built-in.o
  LD      .tmp_vmlinux1
arch/i386/kernel/built-in.o(.text+0x2da1): In function `do_nmi':
: undefined reference to `__trace'
arch/i386/kernel/built-in.o(.text+0x342c): In function `do_IRQ':
: undefined reference to `__trace'
arch/i386/mm/built-in.o(.text+0x705): In function `do_page_fault':
: undefined reference to `__trace'
make: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
maybe latency.o is not included when linking without
CONFIG_PREEMPT_TIMING?
bests,
martin
