The S/G list is used with the INTERFACE chip, i.e., whatever the
device is connected to. If you have a PCI/Bus and the device is
to do DMA across the PCI/Bus with a chip that requires a S/G list,
then you need the S/G list (which is trivial BTW). If your interface
device doesn't require a S/G list then you don't use one.
For instance, a common PCI/Bus interface chip is the PLX PCI 9656BA.
This has a S/G list. In principle, it's possible to bypass the S/G
list, but its downright dumb because you need to get all the information
necessary to build the S/G list anyway, to make one-buffer-at-a-time
DMA (which is what you get without the scatter-list). Typically
scatter lists consists of:
 	uint32_t	padr;	// Bus address to get/put data
 	uint32_t	ladr;	// Local address inside the device
 	uint32_t;	size;	// Transfer size in bytes
 	uint32_t;	dpr; 	// Next descriptor Bus address
That last bus address "dpr" has some low bits that tell the
controller if it is the last in a chain, etc. This stuff needs
to be in physical memory and its bus address is used.
If you don't use a S/G list, then you can't transfer more than
a page of virtual memory because the bus addresses may not
be contiguous. Typically, you build your S/G list using the
appropriate macros to extract the bus address from the virtual
address, so you need this information anyway.
