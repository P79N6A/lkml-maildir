virt_to_phys returns you the CPU physical (after the MMU) address of the
memory in question. You'd want to check the documentation but assuming
the base is still written as an address in bytes then you'd want to do 
something like
	if(agp_bridge.gatt_bus_addr & ~0x1FFFFFFF)
		panic("gatt bus addr too high");
	pci_read_config_dword(agp_bridge.dev, INTEL_ATTBASE, &addr);
	addr&=~0x1FFFFFFF;
	addr|=agp_bridge.gatt_bus_addr;
	pci_write_config_dword(agp_bridge.dev, INTEL_ATTBASE, &addr);
