lspci at least shows only name OR number, but never both
together. 
So that this tool is not very useful for name resolving in case
of problems, because you have no simple way to match your input
with its output. But don't worry, M$ does the same UI mistake and
this can be easily fixed.
But this shifting is a good reason. This also helps the "product
and company changing names" disease ;-)
