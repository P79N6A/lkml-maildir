It's badly documented and complex because .asoundrc was never intended
to be user visible.  If the end user ever needs to edit their ALSA
config files for a standard setup there's a bug somewhere.
Anyway please provide the details of your sound hardware and ALSA driver
& alsa-lib version so we can determine why software mixing does not work
for you.
