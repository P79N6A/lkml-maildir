We *ought* to be safe after cpu_init() ... which is called from setup_arch(),
which is several calls before sched_init().
Thanks for looking at this though ... my ability to test just went
away for a while ... some lab re-organization means all my systems
just got powered off and removed from their rack so the rack can be
moved to a new location.
