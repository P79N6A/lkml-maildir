If it is a too big work to implement "delaying I/O requests" for every
driver, is it possible to implement it as follow:
1. It is triggered to suspend to RAM/DISK.
2. Replace the driver related syscall entries (such as sys_read,
sys_write, sys_ioctl, etc) in sys_call_table with special wrapper
entries provided by "suspend to RAM/DISK" subsystem, which will delay
I/O requests if appropriate.
3. When devices are quiesced, they are put into "low power" state and
system is put into suspend state; or the image is written to disk
(through snapshot/uswsusp or kexeced kernel).
4. After resuming from RAM/DISK, devices are put into "normal" state and
the syscall entries replaced in step 2 are restored.
