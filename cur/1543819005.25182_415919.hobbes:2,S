for example, I'm pretty sure, OVZ smp kernel is not the same as any of 
prebuilt vserver kernels.

filesystem performance also very much depends on disk layout.
If you use different partitions of the same disk for Xen, vserver and OVZ,
one of them will be quickest while others can be significantly slower 
and slower :/
