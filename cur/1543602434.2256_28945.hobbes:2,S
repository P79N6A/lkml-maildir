   I'm very curious as to what workloads are showing pagecache_lock as
   a bottleneck.  We haven't noticed this particular bottleneck in most
   of the workloads we are running.  Is there a good workload that shows
   this type of load?
Again, I defer to Ingo for specifics, but essentially something like
specweb99 where the whole dataset fits in memory.
Franks a lot,
