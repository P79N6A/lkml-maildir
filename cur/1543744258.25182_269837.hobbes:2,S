In this case however, you buy the right to future updates for $20.  
This is
a contract between you and SveaSoft that essentially says:

The penalty for exercising your GPL distribution right is losing your
$20 subscription.  I believe that such a penalty is a restriction on you
exercising your GPL rights.  Such a restriction, when added upon the
GPL license through which SveaSoft can distribute Linux, violates
Section 6 of the GPL:

Therefore, I propose that under Section 4 of the GPL, SveaSoft has
lost its license to distribute the Linux kernel.

All of this is just the opinion of a concerned hacker, not a lawyer so
it may be completely bogus.  I _do_ believe, however, that SveaSoft's
actions violate the spirit of the GPL, especially given actions like 
this:

   -   Scroll down to the bottom,
the part with the email to Yahoo by SveaSoft.
Apparently SveaSoft isn't happy with restricting users by having
them sign away their GPL rights, it is attempting to use FUD to
prevent users from distributing SveaSoft binaries or sources.
