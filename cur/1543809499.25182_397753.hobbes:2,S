That's more or less what I was suggesting.  The problems are: How do you 
know which put is the last?  (Answer: you don't.  So every put has to be 
done in process context.)  And how do you flag the data structure and tell 
some process thread to do the put?  (Answer: by putting the object on a 
list, as in my suggestion.)
