Hi.
I'm running linux-2.6.0-test3 with this patch:
(without the patch, bttv doesn't run)
http://bytesex.org/patches/2.6.0-test3/patch-2.6.0-test3-kraxel.gz
My tv application runs fine, but every few minutes, the
bttv driver re-initializes itself:
Aug 12 23:36:29 lfs kernel: bttv0: IRQ lockup, cleared int mask
Aug 12 23:36:29 lfs kernel: rtc: lost some interrupts at 1024Hz.
Aug 12 23:36:29 lfs kernel: bttv0: timeout: risc=185357c4, bits: VSYNC HSYNC RISCI
Aug 12 23:36:29 lfs kernel: bttv0: reset, reinitialize
Aug 12 23:36:29 lfs kernel: bttv0: PLL: 28636363 => 35468950 .. ok
Aug 12 23:37:33 lfs kernel: bttv0: skipped frame. no signal? high irq latency?
Sometimes during this re-initialization, my
ps/2 mouse looses synchronization:
Aug 12 23:37:33 lfs kernel: bttv0: IRQ lockup, cleared int mask
Aug 12 23:37:33 lfs kernel: psmouse.c: Lost synchronization, throwing 2 bytes away.
Aug 12 23:37:33 lfs kernel: bttv0: timeout: risc=08e8f9e4, bits: VSYNC HSYNC RISCI
Aug 12 23:37:33 lfs kernel: bttv0: reset, reinitialize
Aug 12 23:37:33 lfs kernel: bttv0: PLL: 28636363 => 35468950 .. ok
Aug 12 23:37:33 lfs kernel: psmouse.c: Lost synchronization, throwing 2 bytes away.
Aug 12 23:38:01 lfs kernel: bttv0: skipped frame. no signal? high irq latency?
Then the mouse jumps randomly over the screen and I have to
restart X.
I'm running a bt878 card with tvtime as tv-app.
I hope this helps.
