You rogue!  The panacea, eh?  Well, yes, it does look like that's
enough with egcs-2.91.66 (I don't have 2.95 here to try at the moment,
expect it would behave the same) - the comparison uses "jle" as before,
but now it's correctly on free_one_pmd's index j instead of an address.
Neat - but an even bigger fatter comment needed?
