I've tried switching sched_clock() to call monotonic_clock() on i386
(both functions do basically the same thing, only monotonic_clock
redirects to the system's chosen time source). However,the consensus was
that the access time to read the systems non-"drifty" time source can be
too expensive to make it worth while. 
I'll concede that I haven't done enough testing to measure it in any
great detail, but the interest in my patch was very very low. So I'd be
interested in any measurements you have to the contrary.
Personally, I'd keep your changes arch specific for 2.6. When 2.7 opens
I'd be very interested in ideas and input for broader change in the time
subsystem.
thanks
