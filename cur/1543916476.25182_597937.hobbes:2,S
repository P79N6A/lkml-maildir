Well, sure, in that case sda would get to write out a lot of small
things. But in that case it would be fair wrt the other writers.

Ah, no, that is no good. For if there were a lot of BDIs this might
happen:
  nr_bdis * min_thresh > dirty_limit.

Not sure what we can do here. The current thing is simple, fast and fair.

Ah, indeed. Good idea.
