Hi, 
I wasn't sure how to describe what the people and groups with the
mandate to defend open source software.  There are people and groups
with such a mandate.
I'm asking if in a legal sense the grayness is affected by the
constraints of the hw the kernel is being run on, and some attempt to
quantify how the grayness is affected.  Of course it is not black and
white and ultimately up to a judge. 
I realize similar questions have been asked for more then a decade.
What is generally practiced and accepted does change, and any judge
weighing a case wrt these issues would consider that.
Matt

even for dynamically linking including non-GPL code is not white but 
already dark grey.

There are no "persons responsible for defending the kernel GPL", there 
are just a few hundreds or thousands copyright holders of the kernel,
and each of them has the right to sue you if he thinks you distribute 
something that violates his copyright. Jurisdiction and applicable 
copyright law depends on things like where the copyright holder lives 
and where you distribute it.
