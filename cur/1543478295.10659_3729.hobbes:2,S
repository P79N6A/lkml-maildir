   Btw, if you're willing to test some more, there's a much less intrusive
   way to get basically the same behaviour:
 ...
How about just renaming it to __get_hash_table, add an extra arg "int
uptodate_nowait", make a macro "get_hash_table" which just expands to
passing the new arg as zero.  Then call the internal version directly
from places you know it is safe with the new arg as one?  Seems much
cleaner to me, and no code duplication (ie. unnecessary bloat).
