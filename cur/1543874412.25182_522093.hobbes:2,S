I tried your patch.  After applying it, the error still occurred, so
then I performed the other stepa you mentioned:
         rm init/missing_syscalls.h
         make init
I was then able to continue the build successfully.
Hopefully, I'd not need to run the additional steps again.  Otherwise,
the patch needs a little more work.
Thanks,
              Miles
