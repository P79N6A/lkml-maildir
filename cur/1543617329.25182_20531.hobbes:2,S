Guys, could you lay off whatever the fuck you are smoking?  And
I mean everybody involved.
*	autoconfig is part of ESR's wet dream.  Ignore him and he'll go away.
*	Aunt Tillie and her magical mistery whorehouse <<--->>
*	performance problems with modules are real, need to be solved and
	can be solved.
*	disabling module loading doesn't buy any security.
*	it's easy to make irrevertible disabling modules _after_ boot.
*	initramfs is independent from modules
*	it is _not_ initrd or an analog
*	it doesn't involve a shitload of extra files
*	it removes tons of crap from kernel
*	it allows to simplify build process and get rid of quite a few sources
	of bugs, _if_ performance problems with modules are solved
Now could we fscking drop these threads?  Or at least take care to separate
myths from reality before posting more crap.
