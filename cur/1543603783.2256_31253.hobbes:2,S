It uses vmalloc only when __GFP_VMALLOC flag is given - and so it is
expected to not use __GFP_VMALLOC flag in IRQ.
NOTE: no allocations in IRQ are safe. Not only high-order ones. 
Allocation in IRQ may fail any time and you must recover without lost of
functionality (network can lose packets any time, if you are doing some
general device driver, you must preallocate all buffers in process
context).
