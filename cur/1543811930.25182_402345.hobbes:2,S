Mark checked with the gfx people and it seems that the requirement for
this information was a leftover from an older codebase and they don't
actually need it anymore. Anyway, I'm not sure what illegal drivers
you keep referring to.
Tony/Andrew, it should be ok to take the export out again.
I'll try to look into doing a more generic interface for querying
information about the low level PCI briges at some point. Since
there's no new users screaming for this right now and most current
drivers that will benefit from it are somewhat old, it's not going to
be my top priority item at this moment. Since this would be an
interface, it would obviously have to a regular symbol export.
Cheers,
Jes
