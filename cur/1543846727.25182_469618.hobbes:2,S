I am more wondering why should I answer this,
esp. since you do not even care to CC me.

Am I supposed to explain why I want to prevent an
attacker from executing the exploit he happened to
copy to one of the user-writable mounts of mine?

Quick answer is: because not having the exec permission
(chmod -x file) doesn't prevent you from mapping that
file "noexec", and that's correct, not bug. The more
detailed discussion have already happened, and I'd like
to leave MAP_SHARED aside for a time.
Please tell me how your logic applies to MAP_PRIVATE instead,
because right now MAP_PRIVATE is affected the same way the
MAP_SHARED is.
