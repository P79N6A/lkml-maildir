Copying from NT server is really fun too -- it tried to bring the
entire file into memory. For, pulling a 400MB (database dump) file
off a NT box via SMB sucks rocks -- the machine starts swapping (only
have 256MB of RAM) and thrashes really badly, eventually the file
will copy, but it takes a _long_ time.
There are fixes for this -- but its silly I have to code a custom
Win32 app. to get around this. Grrr... bad M$.
