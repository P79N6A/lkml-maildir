Yes,
There is a reason that it was put there, DI-30's require special IO that
st.o does not know how to do.
Look at all the hoops that it took to get ide-tape to work.
If ide-scsi would have done the trick, it would have saved headaches.
Unless OnStream has changed the firmware it will fail, but please try.
