the kmem cleanup wasn't a bug. So in theory it could be even the leaking
of pagetables that went from -aa to mainline in 23pre1, but I think it
really was the removal of the oom killer with the -aa VM merges that
went into 2.4.23pre[2-5] that really fixed your problem (if it's true
that you had no swap, which I understood it's the case, and no swap puts
at the light the brokeness of the oom killer), that leak is a minor one,
many other places shrinks the per-cpu queues, so it's unlikely to be
able to leak lots of ram in a misc workload.
It's good to hear that pre5 is fixed. thanks.

dunno, but the oom killer certainly has not enough information in 2.6
either to be able to do a reliable decision.
