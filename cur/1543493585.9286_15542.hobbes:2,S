In the excerpt from OpenSources on LinuxWorld, there is
an omninous statement in Linus' musings which goes 
   "Of course Linux isn't being used to its full potential even 
    by today's web servers. Apache itself doesn't do the right 
    thing with threads, for example"
What *should* Apache be doing?
