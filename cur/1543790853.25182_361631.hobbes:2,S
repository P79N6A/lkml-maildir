Most driver bugs cannot be reproduced by the developer.  Almost by
definition: if the patch had caused problems on the developer's machine, he
wouldn't have shipped it.
This is why we have this wonderful group of long-suffering people who
download and test development kernels for us, and who take the time to
report defects.
Yes, it's painful to get into a long-range debugging session, sending debug
patches, twelve-hour turnaround, etc.  But what alternative have we?
