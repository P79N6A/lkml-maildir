__percpu_counter_add() cache the result in percpu variable until it
exceeds the batch.
The prop_norm_percpu() use the percpu_counter_read(&pl->events) to read
the counter ,and use percpu_counter_add(&pl->events, -half) to half the
counter.
There are potential problems:
1.The counter may be negative 
2.After some calculation, it may be converted to a big positive number.
1.
For example, the batch is 32, when the bdi add 32 to the pl->events,
the pl->events->count will be 32.Suppose one of the percpu counter is 1.
In the prop_norm_percpu(),the half will be 16.Because it is under the
batch, the pl->events->count won't be modified and one of the percpu
counter may be -15. If call the prop_norm_percpu() again, the half will
still be 16,though it should be 8.The percpu counter may be -31.
Now, there pl->events->count is still 32.
If do the third calculation, the percpu counter will be -47, it will
be merged into the pl->evnets->count.Then pl->events->count will be
negative.
2.When the pl->events->count is negative,
unsigned long val = percpu_counter_read(&pl->events);
This statement may return a negative number, so the val would be a big
number.Because of the overflow, the pl->events->count will be converted
into a big positive number after some calculation.
Because of the overflow, I catch some very big numerators when call the
prop_fraction_percpu().
I think that it should use percpu_counter_sum() instead of the
percpu_counter_read() to be more robust.
