Subject: [PATCH 2.6.17-rc5-mm2 12/18] ohci1394: set address range properties
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patch supplies the API extension introduced by patch
"ieee1394: extend lowlevel API for address range properties"
with proper addresses.
Like in patch ''ohci1394, sbp2: fix "scsi_add_device failed"
with PL-3507 based devices'', 1 TeraByte is chosen as physical
upper bound.  This leaves a window for the middle address range.
This choice is only relevant for adapters which actually have a
programmable pysical upper bound register.  (Only ALi and
Fujitsu adapters are known for this.  Most adapters have a fixed
bound at 4 GB.)  The middle address range is suitable for posted
writes.
AFAICS, PCILynx does not support physical DMA nor posted writes,
at least as programmed under Linux.  Therefore no equivalent
change in the pcilynx driver is necessary.  There is also a an
out-of-tree driver for GP2Lynx.  I assume this hardware does not
support these OHCI features either.
