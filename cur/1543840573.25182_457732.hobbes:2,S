How did you generate these patches?  When I try to apply them with
git, I get errors like
    error: drivers/infiniband/hw/ipath/Makefile	Fri Aug 25 11:19:44 2006 -0700: No such file or directory
because the line
diff --git a/drivers/infiniband/hw/ipath/Makefile b/drivers/infiniband/hw/ipath/Makefile
makes git think it's a git diff, but git doesn't put dates on the
filename lines.  In other words, instead of
--- a/drivers/infiniband/hw/ipath/Makefile	Fri Aug 25 11:19:44 2006 -0700
+++ b/drivers/infiniband/hw/ipath/Makefile	Fri Aug 25 11:19:44 2006 -0700
the patch should just have
--- a/drivers/infiniband/hw/ipath/Makefile
+++ b/drivers/infiniband/hw/ipath/Makefile
before the Makefile chunks.
I fixed this up by deleting the "diff --git" lines, but I'm curious
how you created this in the first place.
