Hi!
I wrote a few multicast tools, which use these multicast groups:
  225.109.99.112
  ff02::6d63:7030
  224.110.99.112
  ff02::6e63:7030
I have a Cisco in the middle, and both boxes are in different VLANs.
The Cisco is sending out igmp queries.  The kernel never answers, even
after subscribing to these multicast groups.
The kernel version is 2.4.26.  What could be the problem here?
I found no netfilter rules, and the kernel has multicast support (at
least several igmp related sysctls exist).
Felix
