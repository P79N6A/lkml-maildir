Using '//' would be nice, but would break real apps. If I remember
correctly, POSIX specifies that '//' can be special at the _beginning_ of
a path, but in the middle, it has to act like a single '/'.
And that's not just theory - it's quite common for programs to just 
concatenate a directory name (which may or may not end with a slash) with 
another path-name that starts with a slash. So you _will_ see existing 
scripts and programs using things like "/usr/include//sys/type.h", and 
they'd break if "//" would switch from "regular namespace" to "attribute 
namespace".
So I don't see any way to extend pathname semantics to distinguish between 
"directory contents" and "directory attribute stream".

That's not the problem - since it's in memory, we can just get the dcache 
lock, and do it locked for t least local filesystems.
However, being prodded by Andries, I think I'm wrong _anyway_. Since the
dcache is only "dense" down one path to the root, and doesn't contain all
the alternate ways of getting to a particular directory, I came to the
conclusion that the VFS layer can't actually do cyclic detection after
all...
So together with the fact that nobody really _wants_ hardlinks to 
directories, I think the right answer is "no". It's not a problem as long 
as the attributes streams are always tied to the file/directory they are 
attributes of - then the "directory link" is really just a file link, and 
can't cause any cycles.

Do we have any servers that implement it? I think NFSv4 might be a good 
test-case if so.

Hey, I see the smiley, but I'd still like to point out that not many 
people use it under Linux, and while I think writing to it might be stable 
these days, I don't believe named streams are necessarily going to 
materialize all that quickly..
