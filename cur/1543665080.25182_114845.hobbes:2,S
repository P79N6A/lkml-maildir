That error was from a booting 2.5.62 and i do get the warnings about 
missing error handling.

I'm not concerned about that, that was peripheral damage from another 
patch (affected irq handling), the difference being is that with 2.5.62 it boots 
after printing those errors a couple of times, but with 2.5.63 it doesn't.

I'm currently using it with the following devices and survives general 
usage.
