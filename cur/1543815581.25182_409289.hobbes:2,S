I think just *probe* needs it. The firmware which supports memory-hotplug, ACPI, 
i386/x86_64/ia64, can tell node number as pxm.(proximity domain)
add_memory() can pass address of paddr as args, but can't pass *pxm*. 
We already maintain pxm <-> nid map. But paddr <-> nid map isn't now.
If add_memory() doesn't has nid as args, we have to maintain
(1) pxm <-> nid map.
(2) paddr <-> nid map.
Becasue pfn_to_nid() is maintained by SPARSEMEM itself now, *new* paddr<->nid map
is redundant, I think. And I think the firmware already has the map before calling
add_memory().

maybe a big patch :(, We (I and Goto-san) are discussing to split them to
a bit small chunks.

Okay, we'll rename it.

Okay.
