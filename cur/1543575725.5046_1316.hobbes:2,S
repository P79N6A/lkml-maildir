There will be a 
struct file *shmem_file_setup(char * name, loff_t size)
which gives you an open sruct file to an unlinked file of size
size. You can then do
down(&current->mm->mmap_sem);
user_addr = (void *) do_mmap (file, addr, size, prot, flags, 0);
up(&current->mm->mmap_sem);
with that struct file. You can look at shmget/shmat in ipc/shm.c. They
use the same procedure form kernel space. 
All this will only work with my patch.
Greetings
		Christoph
