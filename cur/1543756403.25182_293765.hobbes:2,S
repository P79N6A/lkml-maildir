That's an interesting idea, thanks, but we'd need both money and a new 
hire.  There is an opportunity cost with using up an engineer and we're
swamped with work.  As I've said before, if you really like this sort of 
stuff we'd like to hire you.  Yeah, it's not as politically correct as
working on 100% GPLed source, I can't help that, but it is technically 
challenging, far more so than most people realize and that makes it
fun.
If we get a new hire from the kernel list I'll stick the changeset markers
into the CVS tree so you can group the patches, I can see where that
might be helpful for debugging.
