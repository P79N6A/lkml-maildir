Rot.  "Multiple authors" doesn't get you out of that.  If you take a code
available under GPLv2 or later and combine it with code under specific
version of GPL, result is under than specific version of GPL.  If you want
to argue against that, make sure to Cc RMS on that, I would really like to
hear his opinion.
Multiple authors == need permission from each author with enough
contributions to that file to make the contributions in question
copyrightable.
And in my case (and case of gregkh, and...) that would be considerably
more than a couple of files.  Really.
