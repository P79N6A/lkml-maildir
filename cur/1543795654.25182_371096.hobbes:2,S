I agree this is something that we should handle if we can.

The patch looks like a good one to express the idea, but it is a
bad one to push upstream.
safe_smp_processor_id has a printk in it.
mm/fault.c has related code that really should go into a separate
patch.
For crash_nmi_callback I don't feel very comfortable about
dropping the cpu parameter.  I suspect you want to move
the call safe_smp_process_id to do_nmi (which is current
calling smp_processor_id).  Basically the whole nmi path needs a stack
overflow audit.  I believe we have a separate interrupt stack that
should help but..
