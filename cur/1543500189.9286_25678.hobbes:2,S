It will not result in any problems. Such setup is valid.
Actually, one of the most paradoxical but still valid setups
is when physical interfaces have no addresses at all,
and all the host addresses are attached to loopback.
Mapping address <-> interface is required only by a few bsd derived
control programs (sort of gated), but even they may be fixed not to rely
on such mapping too much.

Exactly as all another ones.
