2.6.28-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
From: Nick Piggin <npiggin@suse.de>
commit 18e6959c385f3edf3991fa6662a53dac4eb10d5b upstream.
This assertion is incorrect for lockless pagecache.  By definition if we
have an unpinned page that we are trying to take a speculative reference
to, it may become the tail of a compound page at any time (if it is
freed, then reallocated as a compound page).
It was still a valid assertion for the vmscan.c LRU isolation case, but
it doesn't seem incredibly helpful...  if somebody wants it, they can
put it back directly where it applies in the vmscan code.
