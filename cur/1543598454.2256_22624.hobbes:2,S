So am I. To be honest, there's a bunch of things in the USB code I'm not
entirely happy.
I didn't see many of them until recently, but I guess with experience,
comes wisdom. I had intended to fix many of them in 2.5 when it finally
forks.
I like your patch, but since we have the new completion stuff now, we
should probably use that. I'll make the mod and send off the patch to
Linus when I get back from this business trip.
Thanks.
