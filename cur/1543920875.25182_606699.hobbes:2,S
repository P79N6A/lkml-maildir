Kgdb has been submitted for inclusion in the mainline kernel at this
point, along with an additional change to the netpoll rx path.
If it is the case that this needs to be implemented in another manner,
that is ok but please do let me know what the plans are for the API so
that the kgdboe code can be adapted.
Thanks,
Jason.
