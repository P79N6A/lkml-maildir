I think it makes sense to start from lower layers first:
Kernel team is reasonably aware of the bloat danger.
glibc is worse, but thanks to heroic actions of Eric Andersen
we have mostly feature complete uclibc, 4 times (!)
smaller than glibc.
Xlib, GLib.... - didn't look into them apart from cases
when they do not build or in bug hunting sessions.
Quick data point: glib-1.2.10 is 1/2 of uclibc in size.
glib-2.2.2 is 2 times uclibc. x4 growth :(

I actually tried to convince maintainers of one package
that their code is needlessly complex. I did send patches
to remedy that a bit while fixing real bugs. Rejected.
Bugs were planned to be fixed by adding more code.
I've lost all hope on that case.
I guess this is a reason why bloat problem tend to be solved
by rewrite from scratch. I could name quite a few cases:
glibc -> dietlibc,uclibc
coreutils -> busybox
named -> djbdns
inetd -> daemontools+ucspi-tcp
sendmail -> qmail
syslogd -> socklog (
http://smarden.org/socklog/
)
It's sort of frightening that someone will need to
rewrite Xlib or, say, OpenOffice :(
