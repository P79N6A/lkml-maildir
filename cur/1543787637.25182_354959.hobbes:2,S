No, you can't re-use "check_kill_permissions()" like this, even though I 
do understand the appeal.
The generic kill permissions check things like the current session, and 
whether the caller has extra permissions, neither of which is sensible in 
the context of "group_send_sig_info_as_uid()". So you do need to write out 
the uid/euid checks separately, and have a different function for this 
thing.
