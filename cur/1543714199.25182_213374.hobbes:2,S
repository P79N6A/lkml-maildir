In common workloads e.g., add libc mapping using  __vma_prio_tree_insert,
mostly you do not add new nodes to the tree. Instead, you just add to
a vm_set list. I am currently considering using rwsem to optimize
such cases. Similarly __vma_prio_tree_remove can also be optimized
in some common cases. I don't know whether it will help. Let us see...
