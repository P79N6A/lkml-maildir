It's relatively common that a regression in subsystem A will manifest as a
failure in subsystem B, and the report initially lands on the desk of the
subsystem B developers.
But that's OK.  The subsystem B people are the ones with the expertise to
be able to work out where the bug resides and to help the subsystem A
people understand what went wrong.
Alas, sometimes the B people will just roll eyes and do nothing because
they know the problem wasn't in their code.  Sometimes.
