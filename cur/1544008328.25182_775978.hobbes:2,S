You mean only tracing one function and its tree of calls (by defining
a kind of root
of tracing?) as suggested Arjan?
Yeah, that would be great.
To define it through trace_filter, perhaps we could use the sign "^"
before a function name to say:
"all calls which starts with this function". I hope that wouldn't
confuse with the real sense that "^" has in regular
expressions.
