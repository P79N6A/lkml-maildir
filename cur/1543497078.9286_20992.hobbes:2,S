Hello,
2.2.5 doesn't recognize my Elsa QuickStep 1000-pro PCI ISDN controller
in /proc/pci, although the ISDN drivers from ftp.suse.com work fine
(they have their own #define's for this device).
  Bus  0, device   9, function  0:
    Network controller: Unknown vendor Unknown device (rev 1).
      Vendor id=1048. Device id=1000.
      Medium devsel.  Fast back-to-back capable.  IRQ 9.  
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xe4000000 [0xe4000000].
      I/O at 0xf600 [0xf601].
      I/O at 0xf700 [0xf701].
Maybe someone can find out the correct vendor/id names for this device
and provide a patch?
