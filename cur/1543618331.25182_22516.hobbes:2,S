 Now, I think the theory itself is OK. The problem is that the stuff in
buffer/caches is to sticky. It does not go away when "more important"
uses for memory come up. Or at least it does not go away fast enough.

 Correct. The free target would help to avoid the panic/frenzy that
breaks out when we run out of free memory.
 Question: what about just setting a maximum limit to the cache/buffer
size. Either absolute, or as a fraction of total available memory? Sure,
it maybe a waste of memory in most situations, but sometimes the
administrator/user of a system simply "knows better" than the FVM (F ==
Fine ? :-)
 While being there, one could also add a "guaranteed minimum" limit for
the cache/buffer size. This way preventing a complete meltdown of IO
performance. True64 has such limits. They are usually at 100% (max) and
I think 20% (min), giving the cache access to all memory. But there were
situations where a max of 10% was just the rigth thing to do.
 I know, the tuning-knob approach is frowned upon. But sometimes there
are workloads where even the best VM may not know how to react
correctly.
