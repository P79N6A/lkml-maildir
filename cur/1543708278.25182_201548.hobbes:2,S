Yeah, and that's unfair to Intel. They've done the right thing 
technically, and I applaud them for that, but their marketing people are 
pricks.
Everybody else is "Intel-compatible" when they make x86 chips.  Intel is
apparently a bit too used to _not_ saying "AMD-compatible".
Oh, well. The marketing people are probably proud of their "branding", and 
screw the confusion.
