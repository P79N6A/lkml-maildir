Subject: [PATCH 0/11] rlimits for both queued signals and POSIX mqueues
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

The following patches introduce per user rlimits for both queued
signals and POSIX message queues.  The changes touch all the arches
resource.h files as well as init_task.c to get the rlimit defaults setup.
Both require caching the user_struct to avoid problems with setuid().
The signal changes makes some small changes to send_signal() to pass
along the task being signalled to get proper accounting for signals
initiated in interrupt.  Patches are relative to 2.6.6-bk.  Thanks to
Marcelo for getting this one going.
thanks,
-chris
