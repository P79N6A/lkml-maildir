Yes, I do have objections now that the ieee1394 is different in
2.6.21-rc7-mm1.
Now you have two options in the firewire menu, namely the new
stack and the old stack. Then menuconfig is not really suitable
anymore.
So please skip it until the old stack finds its way out (which may
take some more time, yes).
