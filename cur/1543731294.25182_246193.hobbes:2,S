The header changes in your patchkit are still rather strange, you're e.g.
adding a pfn_t or clusterid_t but never using it.  As suggested in a previous
mail please also provide a clean set of headers in addition to the clean set
of source files.  There's lots of dead wood in thos and with all the code
gone youshould be able to kill off all the IRIX-compat gunk, etc..
