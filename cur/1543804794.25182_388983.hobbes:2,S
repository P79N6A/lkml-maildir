5.3.0 is "beta", 5.93 is "stable". But there is one thing that won't let 
you use newer Coreutils: LSB, namely the Li18nux2000 tests. Coreutils is 
one of those packages that never go to distros in their pristine form. 
And, alas, there is still no working patch against Coreutils-5.93 that 
allows passing the LSB testsuite completely. And distromakers won't 
trade bugs tested in LSB for bugs unknown to LSB but fixed upstream. So, 
users are really screwed.
