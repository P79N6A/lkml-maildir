You might want to look at:

NILO is the Network Interface Loader. NILO will boot Linux, FreeBSD, Windows
95/98/NT4 and support the Intel PXE standard, and is suitable for burning into
ROM. It is an evolution of the previous Etherboot and Netboot projects, and was
authored by Ken Yap, until Rob Savoye took over active development..
(I've not used it, but I used to work with Rob).
