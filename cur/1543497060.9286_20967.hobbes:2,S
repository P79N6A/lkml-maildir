It shouldn't, you're right; all I said was that *if* screen doesn't
work with the proper permissions on /dev/pts (as given above), *then*
screen is broken.
I don't use screen, so I don't know if it's broken or not.
gid=5,mode=620 allows programs like write(1) to operate properly.

The above is incorrect too: you should either change your mode to
mode=600 or add the appropriate gid= option (for group tty).
