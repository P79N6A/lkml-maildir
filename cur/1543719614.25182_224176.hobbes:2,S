Fixed.  The patch is already added to Bugzilla.
Using these  patches, the  keyboard behaviour is  correct again  on my
notebook:
        SysRq ==> Input Event with code KEY_SYSRQ
        PrintScreen ==> Input Event with code KEY_KPASTERISK
                        (because PrintScreen is Alt-KP_ASTERISK)
        SysRq SPACE gives sysrq help screen
        Alt-PrintScreen SPACE gives sysrq help screen
        PrintScreen SPACE gives "*" and no sysrq help screen        
    Dan> See

 for more
    Dan> info.
Both patches are there at the Bugzilla site.
(BTW, why did  Vojtech REJECT this bug report at  Bugzilla?  Give me a
reason!  I do observe the bug and I have even found a fix.)
