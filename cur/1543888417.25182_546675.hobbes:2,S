I'm not sure I follow you here. The difference between 2.6.21 and 2.6.21.1
are two simple (as in involving little code) changes to ip4 and ip6 net
and I'm not even sure that code is used at all in your tests.
[Read: IMO the 2.6.21 and 2.6.21.1 figures are for identical cases].
Assuming the above is correct then IMO the variance between the two
"dublicated" lines (cfs-v13 and sd048) is such that I would not have
written "that they are reasonable stable on the same hardware".
I don't want to say the values aren't useful. I simply think there is
a high noiselevel.
Best,
Michael
