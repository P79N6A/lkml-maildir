If you're talking about the VMEMMAP thing, that patch didn't remove
the problem, it simply added optimizations for sparc64 so that you could
sweep the problem under the rug.
Sparc32 is still broken, as just one of several possible examples.
The BSS usage is still there for platforms that don't use VMEMMAP.
So again, the lwn.net report is accurate.
