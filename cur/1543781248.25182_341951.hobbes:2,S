My jaw just clonked on the table. And the media error at hand made you
buy a new CD-RW. There is precedence for this (remember the blaming X and
other programs in the keyboard driver?) so perhaps the kernel people could
amend the error like:
hdc: drive_cmd: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hdc: drive_cmd: error=0x04 { AbortedCommand }
ide: failed opcode was: 0xec
ide: Did you just run "hdparm -I" or do you use a nosy desktop?
