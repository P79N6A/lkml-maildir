I thought this worked perfectly, like this:
The background spellchecking thread hogs the cpu and is
quite correct marked non-interactive.
The other thread that mostly sleeps waiting for keystrokes
is marked interactive because of all that sleeping.
So the spellchecker might stall now ant then, and the interactive
thread gets priority when it occationally have work to do.
Don't get confused by the fact that this word processor of
yours is two (or more) threads, with separate priorities.
The kernel don't prioritize tasks like "word processor" or
"mail daemon", it deals with separate threads.

This is almost impossible to get right, except for a few very special
cases like a single user working at the console.  Unix is supposed to
do much better than that - the user logging in via a serial port,
(or more commonly these days, via the network) should get exactly
the same responsiveness as that console user.
Further, we may (sometimes) know that some devices is connected
to a human.  But how about that script reading one disk file
and writing to another?  Is it some cron job, did it start
from some GUI menu with a user eagerly waiting for it to finish?
Or did the user switch to the workd processor because he
knows the script will take "forever"?

The're interactive if the user is staring at / listening to the output.

Use a multithreaded word processor and you'll get exactly this behaviour,
with the current system.  See above.

This works already, because the app slept waiting for that keystroke.

This usually works fine:  The part of X handling keystrokes
sleep - and get interactivity bonus when you press keys.
The apps waiting for X io sleeps, and get interactivity bonus
when they get something to do.  The sleep-based interactivity
estimate works here.

That is _hard_, perhaps so hard that it isn't worth it.  Making it work
with X means a change to the X protocol (because the user might
wery well sit at some other pc/xterminal).  Unfortunately, the
other end might run something else than linux.

It can't without that X protocol change, for the "foreground process",
the "window manager" and the "X server" may all be running on three
different machines.
I do this all the time at home:
I sit at a pc that is configured as a X terminal.  It runs the X server
only.  My window manager and ordinary shells runs at another machine
with much better cpus.  (Why?  Because my girlfriend use the big machine
for reading mail and playing games) Then I log into my office pc
and runs some X apps from there.  Will your scheme work with
this - and work right?
If you only solves for the common case of one
user running all apps on the same machine, then my x-terminal
apps will wait too much for my girfriends games.  Even if
the office pc has plenty of free cpu time, because the big
machine won't give ssh priority enough to transfer the X output
to my xterminal.
This case works well today.

I don't think you can make it work in all the cases where
today's system works well.  If you overload the machine something
has to wait - it is that simple.  Letting those that wait more than
they have to (i.e. io waiting) get extra priority seems to work
quite well.
