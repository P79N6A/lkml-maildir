Any idea on what constitutes "too big"? We could always cap things at some
reasonable maximum. AFAIR, the reason it's set to clustersize these days is
because it actually made a performance impact on large file operations -
backing up a data base file, for example.

No, I don't mind really - it's a minor bit of code and it'll save us all
some space on the super block structure. I assume we can just continue to
follow Christoph's suggestion in ocfs2_getattr().
