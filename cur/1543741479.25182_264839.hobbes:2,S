Hi,
Just to announce that it is now possible to compile and start booting 
Linux with the TCCBOOT boot loader 
(
http://bellard.org/tcc/tccboot.html
). It takes less than 15 seconds on 
a 2.4 GHz Pentium 4 to compile and boot Linux :-)
TCCBOOT contains the latest release of the TinyCC C compiler, assembler 
and linker, which is able to compile most of the Linux kernel with only 
tiny patches. Of course there are still a few bugs in the generated 
kernel, and the code quality is far from the one of GCC, but it shows 
what it is possible to do with a 110 KB C compiler !
Fabrice.
