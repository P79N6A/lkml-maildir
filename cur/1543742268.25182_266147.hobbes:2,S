  For example in a computer lab at the university the admin don't want
to allow users to Umount/Kill (mainly to make it harder for users to
screw up the computer) but wants to allow SAK/Unraw.
  Another (actually not so legitimate ;) example is that in e.g. SUSE
kernels sysrq is turned off by default (some people are afraid that it
could be a security issue) so most users have it turned off and hence
when the computer deadlocks, there's no debugging output. When you could
allow only debugging outputs then the fear about security would be much
smaller.
  So in general it's mainly to make life a bit easier to
admins/developpers...

  OK, I'll rediff it againts latest -mm if we agree that inclusion
would be useful.
