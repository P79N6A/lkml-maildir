I think I disagree with the bug spotting.
At least in net we the sysfs_rename_mutex which keeps parent
directories from disappearing.  Further we have a reference
to the leaf sysfs_dirent and are actively manipulating it, so
the sysfs_dirent should not disappear on us.

Right.  __sysfs_get_dentry is an optimization that has makes
the best case for sysfs_get_dentry O(1) instead of O(depth).
However this doesn't matter because sysfs_get_dentry is not
on any fast path and the maximum depth of sysfs directories
is fairly shallow and programmer controlled.
The only user other user of __sysfs_get_dentry is in the tagged
directory support, and even that user doesn't strictly need it.
Although it is a bit silly to populate the dcache just so you
can invalidate it a moment later...
Just doing the dget(sysfs_sb->s_root) is a bit clearer in
sysfs_get_dentry then knowing implicitly that is what
__sysfs_get_dentry does in the worst cased.
