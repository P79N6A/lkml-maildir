Hm. Hell - that h must have been a k - it must mean something like
the secret or hidden place, as in Latin celare or Greek kaluptein
and in cellar and conceal and occult.
Much more can be said. Some other time.
Hmm. God. Less easy. Will think about that one.
You use it as if it were a proper name, but that must be a mistake.
Gothic has "guth", a neuter consonant stem. And it is the same in
Old Nordic. Maybe the word is Germanic only? Or connection with Sanskrit hu-?
Bible. Greek: biblion. Booklet.
But concerning mount [French monter, Latin montare etc]:
(i) Your version is ancient, but it might be good enough.
(ii) Labels as used in "mount -L label" are ext2 labels only
(well, xfs also works if I recall correctly)
(iii) I forgot to implement a crystal ball, so mount is not
very good in divining [yes, that is related to the old
indoeuropean words for god] where the devices are with a
given label. However, it will try everything mentioned in /proc/partitions.
In your case that is a very short list.
