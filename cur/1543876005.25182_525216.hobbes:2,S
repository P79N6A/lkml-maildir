Hi,
	It is not that simple,
	Only in legacy replacement mode HPET can be put on IRQ0 (and sadly  IRQ8)
	At least this is true on some systems, on mine for example
	On my system first 2 hpet timers can only be assigned to IRQ21-23
	and third to ether IRQ11, IRQ21-IRQ23
	Or in legacy replacement mode first is assigned IRQ0 and second IRQ8
	this will make it difficult to use it as a clockevents source
	Not to mention the fact that current code assumes that BIOS assigned IRQs to all timers which is not true on my system.
	I have brand new intel DG965 motherboard.
	What is wrong with relying on HPET to provide RTC IRQ ?
	Best regards,
