It is for the users that matter, and the hooks are there if someone finds 
it to be a performance problem.

For the vast majority of these sorts of statistics counters, we don't 
need 100% accurate counts.  And I think it should be possible to choose 
between a lightweight implementation and the expensive implementation.  
On a chip like the Core Duo the cost of bouncing between the two cores 
is minimal, so all the extra code and data is a waste.

Yes.  What happens on the P4 is that it forces outstanding memory 
transactions in the reorder buffer to be flushed so that the memory barrier 
semantics of the lock prefix are observed.  This can take a long time as
there can be over a hundred instructions in flight.
