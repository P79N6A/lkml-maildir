one more warning wrt. PREEMPT_REALTIME: if this option is enabled then
it is not safe to make interrupts non-threaded via
/proc/irq/*/*/threaded. If you need to turn an interrupt into a
high-prio event then its irq thread should be set to RT priority via
'chrt'. (-T7 will turn off /proc/irq/*/*/threaded altogether, to make
sure it's not set accidentally.)
