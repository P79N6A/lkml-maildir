Hi, Valdis.  No, I actually used 2 different kernels for this:  one
for system kernel and the other for captured/crash kernel.
System kernel .config file with these options
CONFIG_KEXEC=y
CONFIG_CRASH_DUMP=y
CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START=0x1000000
CONFIG_SYSFS=y
CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO=y
make; make modules_install; make install
System kernel Grub entry
title CentOS (2.6.18)
      root (hd0,0)
      kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.18 ro root=/dev/sda3 crashkernel=128M@16M rhgb quiet
      initrd /initrd-2.6.18.img
Crash/captured kernel .config file with these options
CONFIG_LOCALVERSION="-kdump"
# CONFIG_SMP is not set
CONFIG_KEXEC=y    <-------------------------------------------------------------
CONFIG_CRASH_DUMP=y
CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START=0x1000000
CONFIG_PROC_VMCORE=y
the /boot/vmlinux is found in the linux-2.6.18kdump directory after I
make and make install_modules for the crash kernel.
Am I missing something? Or did I do something wrong?  Is my vmlinux ok
or how I go about to obtain an uncompressed ELF image of the crash
kernel?
Thank you for all the helps.
Steven.
