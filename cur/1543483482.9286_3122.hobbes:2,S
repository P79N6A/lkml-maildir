No, the thought of server-side compiles never crossed my mind :)). The CVS is
ok for the first download, but every next download would be done as a
diff-only retrieval process. Given the list of the user files, the server
could generate a customized patch for that particular user. The diff
generation stresses the server a bit, but way less that gcc does, so I guess
it would work...
