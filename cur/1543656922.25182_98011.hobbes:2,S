Hi LKML,
I'm glad to see this patch available, as Greg was.
Now I have some questions about it.
a.  Is it only for drivers?  If so, why?
    Filesystems and other subsystems that are not drivers could use
    something like this also.
b.  Is it only for drivers that have a device?
    What does a driver use for dev_printk() if it doesn't have a <dev>?
    However, these do cover the large majority of cases, so that's good.
c.  Maybe I'm too cautious (I don't like panics or oopsen :), but I would
    have checked <dev> for NULL in those macros.
d.  and I know that <sev> is severity, but spelling it as severity
    or level would have been better.  :)
IOW, this is a good start, no doubt.  However, it appears to be limited
in scope to drivers.  That's still a good start, but there's more to do.

PS:  Yes, I know Greg's 2 favorite words:  Patches accepted.
Maybe early next year.  ;)
