Hmm, I have a similar problem with my Xircom 10/100 adapter (xirc2ps_cs).
On resume it never works, so I eject/insert it each resume (via cardctl).
My 3cce589et (10Mbps) card does not have this problem.
In dmesg xirc2ps_cs reports:
eth0: media 10Base2, silicon revision 4
On a normal insertion it reports:
eth0: MII link partner: 0081
eth0: MII selected
eth0: media 100BaseT, silicon revision 5
I'm not sure if that is the real problem or just a symptom.  I'll have to
look if it supports the enable_wol parameter...  Nope.  Any ideas?  2.4.17
Cheers, Andreas
