Apathy?
No-one has complained loudly enough or long enough or sent me a patch,
and it simply isn't a priority for me.
(a patch would have to provide clear warning to the user of the change
in defaults, such as is currently done for sync/async (and it's
probably time to remove that warning).
Note: this is purely a userspace issue.  nfs-utils sets the default,
not the kernel.
