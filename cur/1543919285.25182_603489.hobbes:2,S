Mel:  I applied this patch [to your v8 series--the most recent, I
think?] and it does fix the problem.  However, now I'm tripping over
this warning in __alloc_pages_nodemask:
	/* Specifying both __GFP_THISNODE and nodemask is stupid. Warn user */
	WARN_ON(gfp_mask & __GFP_THISNODE);
for each huge page allocated.  Rather slow as my console is a virtual
serial line and the warning includes the stack traceback.
I think we want to just drop this warning, but maybe you have a tighter
condition that you want to warn about?
