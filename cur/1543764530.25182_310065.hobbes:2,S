If Debian was at least consistent.
Why has Debian a much more liberal interpretation of MP3 patent issues 
than RedHat?

Will the replacement documentation for all affected software be 
available before the GFDL documentation gets removed?
At least theoretically, the users are a priority for Debian equally to 
free software.

How do you install Debian on a harddisk behind a SCSI controller who's 
driver was removed from the Debian kernels due to it's firmware?

Documentation is "software"?
Non-free documentation is better than no documentation.
Non-free software has several problems, but some of them like the right 
to do modifications are less important for documentation, since e.g. 
fixes for security bugs are not an issue.
Removing the available documentation without an equal replacement is a 
real disserve for your users.
