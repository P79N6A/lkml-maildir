So essentially you want per-flow multipathing.  Except that you're implementation
is over-optimizing it to the point where it's only per-flow for your specific
case where the connections are short lived and high rate.
This hurts long lasting connections.
So I'm pretty much against this change.  Do it right by making it occur
per-connection attempt, it's not my problem to figure out how to do that
efficiently, it's your's :-)
