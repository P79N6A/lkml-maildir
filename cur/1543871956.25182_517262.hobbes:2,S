Sure, my aproach allows containers hierarchically as children of other
containers too.

But "namespace" has well-established historical semantics too - a way
of changing the mappings of local names to global objects. This
doesn't describe things liek resource controllers, cpusets, resource
monitoring, etc.
Trying to extend the well-known term namespace to refer to things that
aren't namespaces isn't a useful approach, IMO.
