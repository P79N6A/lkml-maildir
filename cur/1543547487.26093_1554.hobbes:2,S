Ok, I need to go look at your code. Sounds like you started doing a
lot of the stuff we discussed during OLS.

At CERN we had a bunch of applications where this would be a win, data
aquisition servers taking data in from on some custom hardware and
sending out data over the wire on another card. You never really want
to touch data in memory with the CPU but because of the lack of
write() zero copy you end up having to do so.
