Wrong.
I spent months developing a Kernel Bug Database, specifically for
Linux kernel development.

My Kernel Bug Database implemented things like searching for bugs
based on comparing entries in uploaded .config files, separation of
bug reports and confirmed bugs, archiving of old bug reports, and
categorisation of bug reports based on the MAINTAINERS file.
I'm sure there was desired functionality missing from it, but I never
got much response from my requests for a 'wish-list' of features.

I don't honestly think we need a bug database.  The mailing list works
well enough.
I'm not actively working on my kernel bug database anymore.
