Okay I installed Debian Sarge today and found a bug in the drm version
ioctls alright with the older interface that XFree86 4.3 uses...
Anyone want to test this patch (Andrew I'll put it my -mm tree ASAP)...
I'm still at a loss to reproduce the brige problems ppl are seeing..
time to switch to i865 chipset ...
Dave.
