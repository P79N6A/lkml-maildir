G400 (not G450, TVout on G450 is not supported and maybe never will).
But 
you should preffer XF3.3.x over XF4 (and if you are going to use XF4,
you
must use HAL from Matrox).

G400 hardware can do that, but nobody bothered with implementation.

G400. If you do not need opensource, then Matrox HAL driver can
initialize
secondary heads from scratch too.

G400.

Sorry. Something else than Matrox ;-)
