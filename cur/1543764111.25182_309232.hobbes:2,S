Sorry, was offline for a week last week; I'll try to look at this more
closely tomorrow.  Checking the buffer_uptodate() without either a
refcount or a lock certainly looks unsafe at first glance.
There are lots of ways to pin the bh in that particular bit of the
code.  The important thing will be to do so without causing leaks if
we're truly finished with the buffer after this flush.

Certainly it's normal for a short read/write to imply either error or
EOF, without the error necessarily needing to be returned explicitly. 
I'm not convinced that the Singleunix language actually requires that,
but it seems the most obvious and consistent behaviour.
