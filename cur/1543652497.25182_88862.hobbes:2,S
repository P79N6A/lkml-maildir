I had to not apply the include/linux/module.h changes as Rusty is in the
middle of hacking that code into a billion tiny pieces.  As it was only
a comment change, I don't think it was a big deal right now :)
And he is currently changing the MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE() logic to not
expose kernel structures to userspace, so you might want to watch that
to see if it will work for your type of devices too.
thanks,
