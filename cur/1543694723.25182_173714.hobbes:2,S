Thanks for the report, Peter.
The request is a special request, so either blk_attempt_remerge should
never be called on it, or blk_attempt_remerge (or as_latter_request) should
check for this. Its up to Jens.
I would say to stick something like
if (!rq_mergeable(rq))
    return;
into blk_attempt_remerge.
I'd say we shouldn't expect drivers to try to get this right.
