   Linux 2.2.5 (and I think later versions as well - I can't find a
   fix in the patch sets for 2.2 or 2.3) does not ACK a FIN received
   when in TIME-WAIT. This leads to connections on the remote host
   taking longer to die than they should, and connections on the Linux
   host remaining in TIME-WAIT longer than they should.
We know about this fallacy and are working on fixes to go into 2.2.11
Later,
