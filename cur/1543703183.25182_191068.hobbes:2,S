Dave did not mean that the other power management schemes cannot do the
automatic reduction on loss of AC, just that there is no SMM/BIOS hacks
to do it automatically.
Your APM scripts are probably adjusting your CPU speed when you go on
AC.  Fedora does this, for example.
That is cool - the OS (user-space, even) controls the policy.
What we don't like is how SpeedStep can be controlled from SMM.
