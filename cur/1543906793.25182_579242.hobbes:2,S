Well it's not a problem with journalling per-se.  Other journalling designs
may well not have this problem.
It's an unfortunate coupling:
- the ext3 journal contains metadata from all altered files
- ordered-mode needs to write back data for a file before committing its
  metdata to the journal.
- fsync of one file requires a commit for its metadata, which will commit
  metadata for all files
- hence we need to write back all data for all files which have metadata
  in the journal.
It's pretty much unfixable given the ext3 journalling design, and the
guarantees which data-ordered provides.
The easy preventive is to mount with data=writeback.  Maybe that should
have been the default.
