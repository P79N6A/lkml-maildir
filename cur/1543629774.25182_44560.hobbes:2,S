You converted the outb_p's to plain outb's. I'm not sure of the reasoning
behind why they were there, but I wasn't brave enough to remove that ;-)
See the patch I mailed out earlier, basically the same idea, but I created
outb_local_p and friends.
Actually, I screwed it up slightly, and put outb_p_local in one, and outb_local_p
in the other. oops.
