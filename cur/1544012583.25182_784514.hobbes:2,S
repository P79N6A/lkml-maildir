If you really want reliable operation without killing performance on the server 
you could use aio and just wait until the data is written to the device. Lots of 
discussion of this in various places, "on the device" may not mean on the 
platter, then you talk disabling write cache, barriers, etc. At least aio should 
(a) be more reliable than just issuing the i/o and (b) not impact the 
performance of the server as fsync would.
Comments welcome, pointers to a benchmark even more so, now I'm curious.
