This touches on a question I have, off-topic to the discussion of
the patch proposed by Hannes.
Doesn't doing a direct-exec have one powerful advantage over sending
some message or kevent to userspace by socket/pipe/d-bus, in that
sending the message requires that there is some userspace code already
running that is competent to receive the message?
Doing the usermodehelper direct-exec _both_ provides the thread context
in which to execute, _and_ the code to be executed.  The alternative
seems to require long running threads, primed and ready to accept
particular events, cluttering up the system.
I will readily grant that this usermodehelper direct kernel exec thing
seems weird as all heck to me.  But I predict that in a couple of weeks
lkml will be seeing a patch from me (the next version of the 'cpuset'
patch I'm working with Simon and Sylvain of Bull) using it -- because
the alternative of a long running, rarely used, user thread just for one
obscure particular event that required user code sucked worse.
Am I missing something?  Are there _always_ better solutions than
usermodehelper's kernel direct-exec?
Or perhaps am I confusing what Andrew was referring to and the various
mechanisms available here in unfortunate ways?
