Ben, one of the reasons of the /dev/epoll speed is how it returns events
and how it collapses them. A memory mapped array is divided by two and
while the user consumes events in one set, the kernel fill the other one.
The next wait() will switch the pointers. There is no copy from kernel to
user space. Doing :
int sys_epoll_wait(int epd, struct pollfd **pevts, int timeout);
the only data the kernel has to copy to userspace is the 4(8) bytes for
the "pevts" pointer.
