run RTC is localtime; date -s; reboot; wrong time if time corrected more than a few minutes.
I think it's an issue. (Imagine power failure instead of ordinary 
reboot)

Wouldn't be much surprised, but can't comment.

Already implemented. (See earlier message)

That's a big matter of taste IMHO.

Why do you think I fixed it? Maybe just for you ;-)
