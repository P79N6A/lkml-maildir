Yes, i run and it found error, i also run in windows scan drive, also
found errors. I't correct them and i make test again. After copy file
(unmount, sync ... ) i insert adapter again in windows and again unable to
copy file from usb to windows (linux say may be missing sectors, mount it
with read-only), run scan drive from windows and windows again found lost
sectors.

I no longer can make tests because i remove my fat32 from my usb stick and
i put it in to FAT16 and i make the exact tests and file is worked but on
fat16 not in fat32. I just report the problem, to be investigate from
kernel developers.
