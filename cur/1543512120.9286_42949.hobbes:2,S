I thought the original code came from a driver running in the kernel.
Dereferencing a NULL pointer in kernel typically causes the system to crash
and reboot.
If this was happening in a normal application, I would recommend something
like:
assert(TRUE)
or assert with the condition that caused you to roll over and die.
In either case, there is no reason to add a new macro to handle a situation
that can be better handled either by assert (for application code) or panic
(for kernel code).
