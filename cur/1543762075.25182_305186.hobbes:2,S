Subject: unused 'size' assignment in filemap_nopage

filemap_nopage has the following code:
retry_all:
	size = (i_size_read(inode) + PAGE_CACHE_SIZE - 1) >> PAGE_CACHE_SHIFT;
	if (pgoff >= size)
		goto outside_data_content;
	/* If we don't want any read-ahead, don't bother */
	if (VM_RandomReadHint(area))
		goto no_cached_page;
	/*
	 * The "size" of the file, as far as mmap is concerned, isn't bigger
	 * than the mapping
	 */
	if (size > endoff)
		size = endoff;
After this, size is not referenced.  So, either this potential reassignment
of size is superfluous, or we are missing some other code later on in the
function.  If it is the former, I've attached a patch which will remove the
code.
Thanks,
Jeff
