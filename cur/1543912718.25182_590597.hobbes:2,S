Ah, right.

In the context of kernel features, "experimental" doesn't mean that
developers are conducting experiments, but rather that users may use it
for experimental purposes.  Kernel packagers/ distributors/ admins/
users are advised that this feature is not for use in production (for
whatever reasons, e.g. proof-testing not completed, known instability,
lack of compatibility, missing features).
I have no advise into which attribute to put this and which alternative
values that attribute could assume.
But I can state requirements for the 'experimental' marker, from the POV
of a volunteer driver support guy:
  - Show it in big letters in the Kconfig prompt of an experimental
    feature.
  - Explain at appropriate place(s) what the particular caveats of the
    feature are.
That's it.  I am not aware of a need to evaluate this marker in routines
which calculate the .config, unlike the 'broken' marker.
BTW, the requirements of communication in feature removal processes are
similar to a degree.  But feature removal involves more active two-way
communication and is tied to a schedule.
