For my_school_project_fs perhaps 200 lines is sufficient.
Paul Menage's patch which Chandra was referring to:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/9/28/104
is 1700 insertions. RCFS was around 1500 lines -- similar to Paul's
patch -- before we moved to configfs and reduced that to about 300-400
lines. This suggests we'd need around 1500 lines of filesystem code --
7.5 times your estimate.

	I don't agree. I think it's insane not to use configfs just because we
need a list of pids for each group of tasks.

	There are lots of reasons not to create your own filesystem. When
you're not already a kernel maintainer it's no small task to create and
get a non-trivial filesystem accepted into the kernel. Getting people to
review whole new filesystems has its own problems:
