Hello Kernel list
Would someone please tell me where I can find docs/info on using
the kernel PCI functions under linux 2.2 and 2.4 (2.2 is my immediate
concern). I found Alan Cox article in Linux Magazine and the pci.txt
file in my /usr/src/linux/Documentation directory. Is there more?
Who has been writing the direct PCI functions (not BIOS PCI) and
do they/you have a web page with docs?
Thank you very much,
Daniel Sheltraw
