That's wierd... Where could that be coming from? The client is *never*
supposed to generate that on its own. If an ESTALE turns up, it should
always be generated from the server.
Does that same ESTALE show up on a tcpdump/ethereal dump? If so, could
you please check that the filehandle that is contained from the reply to
LOOKUP(".outbox.index") is the same as that which is sent on the
offending GETATTR call?
Cheers,
