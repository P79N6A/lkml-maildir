I just sent in a patch for SYSRQ which allows it to be used, even
on broken keyboards.  My patch updates the sysrq.txt file
documentation to indicate exactly what you just stated above
also.
My patch is attached, please try it out and let me know if you
have any trouble.
echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq 
	- gives you normal operation 
echo 2 > /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq 
        - allows broken keyboards to work that send make and
break simultaneously when the SYSRQ key is pressed down, and then
nothing when it is released.

 You need to say "yes" to 'Magic SysRq key (CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ)' when
 configuring the kernel. This option is only available in 2.1.x or later
-kernels.
+kernels.  Also, you can enable/disable SysRq at runtime by echoing one of
+the following values into /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq:
+
+0 - disable SysRq
+1 - enable SysRq
+2 - enable SysRq for broken keyboards like the Mtek K208 that send both
