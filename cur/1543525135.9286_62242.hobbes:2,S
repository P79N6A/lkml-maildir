I installed 2.2.14, enabled support for the card, however it still does
not work.  When I issue a play command from the commandline, I get an
error that the /dev/dsp device is not present.  /dev/dsp is there, and has
the correct attributes (comparing with a system that has a working SB
AWE32 card).
