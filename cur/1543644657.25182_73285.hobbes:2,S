I agree with you that there needs to be a strategy for what is logged by a 
driver and how it is logged. We believe log analysis is an essential part of 
diagnosing errors. Log messages, when generated consistently, could indicate 
what drivers were loaded, when they were loaded, what their current version 
is, and what errors they have encountered. How the messages are formatted, 
whether they follow certain rules, can greatly aid User Space diagnostic 
applications. 
We propose standardizing what should be logged and how those log messages 
should look.
What:
- Drivers should log initialization and uninitialization information for both 
drivers and devices. Knowning when a driver is loaded or unloaded is useful 
information. 
- Initialization information should include name of the device, name of the 
driver, and the current version or release levels. Any errors encountered 
during initialization - e.g.  from running self tests - should be properly 
logged. 
- Errors during operation should be logged. 
How:
- Messages should be human readable.
- Messages should  be succinct.
- Messages should uniquely identify the driver and the device, such as many 
drivers already do by prefixing messages with the driver name.
- Beware of log pollution - log only relevant information. Avoid frequently 
recurring messages. 
- Use defined severity levels. 
- Make sure that consitent logging and terminology is used throughout the 
driver. 
Most of what I just outlined is common sense, but it's worth stating. 
Any comments?
