I haven't actually checked, but is it possible that the Windows HT support
suffers from the same scaling issues as the rest of the Windows innards?  To
tie  this in with what Mike Dell said - perhaps the reason he's selling mostly
1/2/4 CPU boxes is because the dominant operating system blows chunks with
more, and in the common desktop scenario enabling HT was actually slower than
leaving it off?
