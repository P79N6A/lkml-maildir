XFS has some nice features such as journalling, dynamically managed inodes,
B-tree directories, and real-time features for multimedia streams (looks like
this last one will not be in the open-sourced code).
But how about performance ?  Does anybody have comparisons of various
filesystems in terms of performance ?
