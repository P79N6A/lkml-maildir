Hi Folks!
is it intentional that the file attributes
(those accessible with chattr -*) are modifyable
even if a file has the 'i' immutable flag set,
and the user is lacking CAP_IMMUTABLE (or all
CAPs if you prefer that ;)
# touch /tmp/x
# chattr +iaA /tmp/x
# lcap -z
# chattr -i /tmp/x 
chattr: Operation not permitted while setting flags on /tmp/x
# chattr -A /tmp/x 
# lsattr /tmp/x
----ia------- /tmp/x
I'd consider this a bug, but it might be some
strange posix/linux conformance issue too ...
let me know if this _is_ a bug, if so, I'm 
willing to provide patches to fix it ...
TIA,
Herbert
