Anything that's single user and non-networked isn't beyond the realms
of feasability - it would be useful for a games console, or high
performance graphics work.
It would be an interesting project, but what concerns me is how well
implemented these non-standard modes actually are.  It's possible that
there are processors out there that don't work reliably with them, or
don't implement them at all.
John.
