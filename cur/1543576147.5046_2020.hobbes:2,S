I was wondering if anyone had any new info/suggestions for the Signal 11
problem.
I think I last reported that I had tried 2.4.0test12 w AGPGart and DRM
turned off. This seemed a bit more stable but I did have X crash with
Signall 11 after about 1.5 days.
I'd really appreciate any advice on how to diagnose this.
Thanks,
