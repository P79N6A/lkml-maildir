But don't confuse the portion of address space used with the number of
page tables in use!  Even if you use a teeny tiny portion of a 64-bit
address space, you can still have hundreds and thousands of page table
pages.
Also, we should not ignore the advantages of the current scheme:
 o It's so straight-forward, it's virtually impossible to screw it up
   (with the hashed scheme, forgetting to set a bit just once could
   lead to very difficult-to-track-down bugs; been there, done that,
   in a slightly different context, and it was ugly...).
 o Performance is very predicable (basically linear in virtual address
   space in use).  There is a danger that a hashed scheme would be
   optimized for today's workloads.  As the working sets increase over
   the years, the hashed scheme could eventually break down and the
   worst part would be that it would be very hard to notice (only
   effect is bad performance for very large tasks; few benchmarks
   would probably catch such worse-than-optimal performance).

Yes.  Hopefully, someone with some spare time at hand can play with
this.
