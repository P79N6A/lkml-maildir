The solution looks more simple: just removing and reloading the
original snd-emu10k1 module reorders the devices so that the default
device gives sound on the digital output. The driver is blacklisted in
udev and loaded at boot time in /etc/modules, so the module-init-tools
initscript will load them. However, I have no idea why it behaves
different if loaded at boot time than when reloaded later.
