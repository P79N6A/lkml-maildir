If we can reduce that barrier, then I think we should. People can't be
expected to keep everything fresh in memory all the time. And we won't
have a team dedicated to hacking this all the time.

In some sense, but there are also several identical FBR chunks on the
card. So by most definitions of a base address, the start of each chunk
would be it.

It's subjective. But the longer version is more understandable for
someone who doesn't have the details of the SDIO protocol fresh in his
mind.
