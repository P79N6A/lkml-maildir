The mere existence of the value means it can be used correctly
in application code for sanity checking.
eg:
   assert(list_length(group_list) < ngroups_max());
   list_append(&group_list, group);
An application might also use it to automatically
size data structure details, such as the parameters of
a hash function.
  h = hash_create(ngroups_max());
Returning INT_MAX for NGROUPS_MAX isn't wrong, but you
then can't blame user space for making inefficient choices
if the kernel limit is actually smaller.
Cheers,
Glen
