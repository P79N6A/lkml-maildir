Hi, 
I've got a machine here that is locking hard under
2.4.23.  Normally would suspect it's a hardware problem
but it runs fine on 2.4.22 and also 2.2 series kernels.  
In a bit of a quandry here since that box has shell
users... 
I'm getting no oopses on the monitor nor in the logs -
this is a hard, instantaneous crash.  No kbd, no nothing,
good night. 
I've got a kernel compiling right now with hacking
support, but none of the additional hacking  options
are enabled. 
Wondering if anyone else has seen this?  lspci output is
below, will wait until requested before dumping a bunch
of crap about my hardware onto the list. 
Anything I can do from userland, let me know.
