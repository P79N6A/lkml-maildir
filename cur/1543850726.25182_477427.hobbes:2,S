Separating the objects into different file descriptors sounds like a
good idea, but reusing an open dentry/inode with a new file and different
file operations is a rather unusual way to do it. Your concept of allocating
a new context on each open is already weird, but there have been other
examples of that before.
I'd suggest going to a syscall-based model with your own file system right
away, even if you don't use the spufs approach but something in the middle:
* You do a trivial nonmountable new file system with anonymous objects,
  similar to eventpollfs, and hand out file descriptors to inodes in it,
  for both the kvm and the vcpu objects.
* You replace the syscall you'd normally use to hand out a new kvm instance
  with an ioctl on /dev/kvm, and don't allow any other operations on that
  device.
This would be a much more consistant object model, compared with other
generic kernel functionality that is not bound to an actual device.
You still have all the flexibility of a loadable module without core
kernel changes for the development phase, and can easily switch to real
syscalls when merging it into mainline.
I really think that a small number of syscalls is where you should be
heading, whether you use a file system or not, but I understand that
ioctls are convenient for development.
