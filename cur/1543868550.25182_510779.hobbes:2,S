BTW: 2.6.18-1.2798.fc6 (Fedora kernel) gave me in dmesg:
Linux video capture interface: v2.00
saa7146: register extension 'budget_av'.
saa7146: found saa7146 @ mem f896a000 (revision 1, irq 145) (0x153b,0x1157).
saa7146 (0): dma buffer size 192512
DVB: registering new adapter (Terratec Cinergy 1200 DVB-T).
adapter failed MAC signature check
encoded MAC from EEPROM was

(irq 145 and 153!?)
I think I can do some testing this afternoon.
Kind regards,
