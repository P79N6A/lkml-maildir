I hope this message has attracted the attention of the Tulip driver
maintainers.
Netgear makes a card that is sorta like a Tulip.... the older model of the
card worked just fine with the existing Tulip driver.  The newer model
needs several patches/hacks, and Netgear provides a new tulip.c file on
their drivers disk.
I remember a while back that someone was looking at working on the Tulip
driver, possibly incorporating some of these types of changes.  I was
wondering if the code to support the new Netgear cards has made it into
the 2.3.5x kernels.
Upon request, I can send the modified tulip.c file.
