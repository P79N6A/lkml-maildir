Well it is certainly one way of doing it. 
Another I considered was to append ':ASH' to the file name and set the
case of the ASH bit appropriately.[1]
The choice of colon as a separator was made as has little special
meaning in unix and is a banned character in FAT filenames.
I even did the lookup part of the patch (including a mount option) for
2.0.35, but ran out of time before I could do the create/rename fixes.

The big problem with this is that it makes assumptions about the name
shortening algorithm used, AFAIK from my descriptions of VFAT the actual
method is not mandated (and certainly not enforced by the data
structures). So I would prefer a method which exposed a
vfat_set_short_name() [2] to userspace, but this is easier said then
done and has come up before.
Again a mount option to form filenames in a "SHRTNAME.EXT:TheLongName"
format might be one simple way round this problem, at least the idea of
both names being set together I _think_ alleviates some of the
complaints/problem with the vfat_set_short_name() method.
Additionally this mount option could be specified together with the
above mount option for the rest of FAT attributes.
TTFN
[1]     Use Permission bit for Read_only, so this then exposes all FAT  
        attributes.
[2]     ISTR, we already have a ioctl for vfat_get_short_name().
