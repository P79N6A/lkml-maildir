Hi Andrew & Paul,
Here are the updates for hotplug memory remove. Most changes are
PPC specific, but I would like these to be included in next -mm 
for easy testing and review, before including in Paul's tree.
eHEA driver folks are verifying if the exported interface
walk_memory_resource() is good enough for their needs. And also,
we are verifying the code on x86_64. Once that is done, we may
be able to cleanup some of the code (make remove_memory() arch
generic).
We still have an issue with not being able to free up the allocations
that came from bootmem. Yasunori Goto wants to clean up that code.
[PATCH 1/5] generic __remove_pages() support
[PATCH 2/5] [PPC] htab_remove_mapping() error handling
[PATCH 3/5] [PPC] hotplug memory notifications for ppc
[PATCH 4/5] [PPC] update lmb for hotplug memory add/remove
[PATCH 5/5] [PPC] provide walk_memory_resource() for ppc
Testing: All the patches are tested on p-series LPAR configuration,
writing to /sysfs & /proc, through DLPAR tools and through HMC. 
Testing on x86_64 needs more work.
Thanks,
Badari
