Sure, that's what we did... provided you have a physical access to
the machine to install such a cable and a second machine... 
But as my only real access is thru an Ethernet cable, I was trying to
identify a software solution.
However, it looks like we're gonna have to go to yours, and try to 
find a way to access the machine physically... 
Thx,
Paul
