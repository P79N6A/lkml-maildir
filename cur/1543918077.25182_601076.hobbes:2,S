Thanks a lot for your suggestions.
Actually we did just as you wrote, but somehow 0-3 parts are missing.
Unfortunately, the parent message [00/15] is in the three.
If the [00/15] will be delivered, everything goes just fine.
We are going to wait some more time and decide to repost them again.
Thanks again.
