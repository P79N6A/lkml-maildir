This isn't actually a spelling mistake.  The chips I have are quite
clearly marked "Integraphics" not "Intergraphics".

This seems wrong.  We're setting up the DAC palette to map pixel color
component 'regno' to 'read', 'green' and 'blue' respectively.
This means that the pseudopalette should be a 1:1 mapping of desired
colour value (ie, the 16 VGA colors) to the DAC palette entries -
the pseudopalette contains the pixel values to insert into the frame
buffer for each of the 16 VGA colors.
