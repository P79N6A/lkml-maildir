Interesting... We experience no such errors what-so-ever with our
AIX-machines (we have installed virtually every existing recommended
patch, though.)

The only problems we ever experience is with AIX nfsd <-> Linux nfs v2.
Before, we also experienced the same problem with SunOS (Solaris) nfsd <->
Linux nfs v2, but after a patch from Sun, this problem disappeared.
Exactly the same pattern of error, though.
