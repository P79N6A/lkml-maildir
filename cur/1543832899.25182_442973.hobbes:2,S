Peeking at CONFIG_FB_MODULE like this is considered sinful.
<tries to remember why>
Because someone might build a CONFIG_FB=n, CONFIG_FB_MODULE=n kernel, then
later build the fbdev module for that kernel only to find that the
backlight driver doesn't know that the fbdev module is available.
Or something like that.  It's pretty contrived, and I really doubt that
anyone's going to try to cobble together a kernel like that.
Or maybe there's a better reason...
