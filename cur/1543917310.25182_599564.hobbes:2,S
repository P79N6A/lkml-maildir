I confirm that 2.6.23-rc8-git2 does not solve my problem with Geode GX1
boot messages shows the same BIOS-E820 maps
after few second or sometime one minute from boot it hangs the system
Again disabling specific performance tricks for GX1/GXm (geode_configure in
cyrix.c) fix my problem.
Please note that I'm using a very minimal embedded PC with minimal (no swap,
no modules, etc..) kernel configuration, no other sw is running other than
statically linked bash.
Thanks
