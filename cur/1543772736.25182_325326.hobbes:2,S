Not sure if my previous posting has been filtered out so here's a
second attempt.
While booting 2.6.12-rc6 the indicated SCSI driver seems
to hang for about 30 seconds. A /var/log/messages excerpt:

I saw some patches for investigating post-rc2 breakage but they don't
apply on plain 2.6.12-rc6. And it may be a different problem.
