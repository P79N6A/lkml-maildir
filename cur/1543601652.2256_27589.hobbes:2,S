I've noticed that on my Athalon 1.4GHz system (Asus A7V133), I get results 
quite a bit higher than reported here when running the athalon.c program.  
For example everyone posting seemed to get 4000-5000 cycles per page for the 
clear_page fuctions "faster_clear_page" and "even_faster_clear" while mine is 
in the 6300-6700 range.  Does this indicate I'm missing some BIOS 
optimizations?  Slow memory?  Something else?
