Dave, we talked about this ages ago as a possible alternative to skb
recycling and persistent IOMMU mappings for those skbs.
Unfortunately you need a hash to map from all of memory to a pci bus
address for each host bridge (well IOMMU), and so far I cant think of
anything that wouldnt chew gobs of RAM.
