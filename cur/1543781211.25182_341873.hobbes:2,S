The oprofile data does not give an evidence that we pay BIG elsewhere.
For examples, the original 2.6.12.4 Top 5 cache misses are the following,
37017 63.4603  vmlinux    __copy_from_user_ll
1049   1.7984  vmlinux    _spin_lock_irqsave
940    1.6115  vmlinux    blk_rq_map_sg
896    1.5361  vmlinux    generic_file_buffered_write
885    1.5172  vmlinux    _spin_lock
pattern9-0-cpu4-0-08141702
cache aware version Top 5 cache misses are
899 5.7305  vmlinux    blk_rq_map_sg
569 3.6270  vmlinux    journal_commit_transaction
531 3.3848  vmlinux    radix_tree_delete
514 3.2764  vmlinux    journal_add_journal_head
505 3.2190  vmlinux    release_pages
...
89 0.5673 vmlinux _mmx_memcpy_nt
pattern9-0-cpu4-0-08141625
What do you think?
