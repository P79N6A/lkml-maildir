Subject: 2.4.18 crashdump - P4/3ware/NFS

I recently built a new home file server based around a P4 1.8Ghz CPU and a
3ware 6410 RAID controller along with a 2-port Intel 10/100 NIC.  The 6410
has 4x120GB IDE drives on it for a 360GB RAID5 drive.  I have been
exporting a a large partition (ext3) via NFS to a couple of other machines
to move some things around (I have another 3ware-based system with dual
P2-400s and 4x80GB in raid5, which in this case was where things were
being moved to).
Several times now the p4 system has either frozen (usually with a
crashdump), or just mysteriously rebooted while moving large quantities of
data over the NFS link.
I'm at a loss to explain this unless it starts to point to hardware
problems (bad CPU? Memory? motherboard?).  I thought for a bit it was due
to setiathome running in the background (one screendump mentioned seti) so
I disabled it and had it work fine when I copied 45GB across, but then
freeze and croak when I started another copy session when the first
completed.
Note, I also export a lot of this system over Samba and haven't had any
problems there, but I'm not pushing the samba links very hard (face it,
MP3s being streamed to winamp ain't hard work...)
I don't have a text log of the dump, but I did take a digital picture of
it at

If anyone has ANY thoughts here, they would be appreciated.  I hate to
start randomly replacing parts without an idea where to look.
Thanks all.
Robert
