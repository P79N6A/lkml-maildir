Very simple. You can't link GPL and proprietary code together. You may be
able to make your code a non free module distributed by yourselves if you
can satisfy your lawyers that it is a seperate work. Take that one up with
your lawyers. Also remember that the kernel code is GPL, so if you based
your driver on existing GPL code (eg by copying an existing scsi drivers
code as a basis) you will also have to sort that issue out too.

Thats becase Linux is free software. We don't merge binary only drivers, and
only maintain source level compatibility between different compiles of the
kernel.
The whole Linux concept is geared around free software, that means source
code, source level compatibility, the ability for people to recompile and
for sane debugging because we have all the sources.
