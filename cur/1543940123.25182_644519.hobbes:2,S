Hi Peter,

I was not sure who though :)
Do we have a mailing list for scheduler development btw ?
Or it's just folks that you included in CC ?
Some of the latest scheduler patches brake things that I'm doing and I'd like to make
them configurable (RT watchdog, etc).

It's not really new. CPU isolation bits just has not been exported before that's all.
Also "CPU sets" seem to mostly deal with the scheduler domains. I'll reply to Paul's 
proposal to use that instead.

Just this patches. RT patches cannot achieve what I needed. Even RTAI/Xenomai can't do that.
For example I have separate tasks with hard deadlines that must be enforced in 50usec kind 
of range and basically no idle time whatsoever. Just to give more background it's a wireless
basestation with SW MAC/Scheduler. Another requirement is for the SW to know precise timing
because SW. For example there is no way we can do predictable 1-2 usec sleeps. 
So I wrote a user-space engine that does all this, it requires full control of the CPU ie minimal
overhead from the kernel, just IPIs for memory management and that's basically it. When my legal 
department lets me I'll do a presentation on this stuff at Linux RT conference or something.
