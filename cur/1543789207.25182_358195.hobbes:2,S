Hi,
I've applied and tested all of these along with what is
currently in -mm (only -mm hpet + timer patches).
By "tested" I mean that I booted the kernel.  :)
What kind of testing have you done?
Do you have any timer test tools that you use to verify that
timers are actually working as expected?
Or maybe I could/should ask one or all of:
- John Stultz
- Thomas Gleixner
- George Anzinger (HRT project does have some tests)
Thanks,
