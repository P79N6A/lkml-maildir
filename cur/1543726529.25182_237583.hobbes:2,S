Nudge accepted :)  I've been more busy than usual.
I am worried because this specific area of code has been "fixed" at 
least twice in recent memory, making Roger's changes the third attempt 
to address this sort of problem.
I would really like to see verification of patches on the hardware 
affected (big endian), as well as tests on little endian to ensure 
nothing breaks, before applying them.
