On Monday, Feb 18, I posted a message that 2.4.18-pre9-ac4
fails to boot on my machine with
FAT: bogus logical sector size 0
FAT: bogus logical sector size 0
Kernel panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on 03:00
messages.  2.4.18-rc1, and many different kernels, do not have
troubles of that sort.  Tonight I found to my dismay that the
same trouble afflicted 2.4.18-rc4.  No, I do not know why this
happens; at least at this moment.
