Ouch.  So lemme think...is it possible for some code macro to detect
it's being compiled pic on the x86 and use alternate macros that
save the appropriate registers?  
The reason I ask is that other wise we are likely going to have to
come up with custom syscall macros for each platform -- now those
macros may be exactly the same as the original on other platforms (they
may not have this problem), but it's alot of icky wasted code space.
In this case, we *are* the library, so my fear is writing pic code
that works on x86 but doesn't on another.  It'd be nice not to
come up with a different mechanism if this isn't broken in the same
way on the other platforms, but to instead fix the x86 platform.
In this situation, we are the library writer, so what we want to stay
away from is having to write platform specific code in the library.
