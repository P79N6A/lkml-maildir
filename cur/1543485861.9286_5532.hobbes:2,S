Yes, that was included in modules-2.0.0 (and can partly still be seen
in the remaining kerneld), but that required changes to all modules that
wanted to use that feature.
It seems not to many people liked the idea... Or perhaps it's because I
left for China for two years... who knows.
I have some long-range hope of trying to coordinate such work with
the PnP-efforts that some people are doing, since that would logically
be part of the same problem (taken a bit loosely).

This would be nice to have, hopefully without having to build additional
features into kmod (or at least as little extra as humanly possible).
