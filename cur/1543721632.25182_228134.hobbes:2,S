Personally I'd make sure the drivers worked with the stock kernel and if
they don't work with a distro's release then the bug is theirs. File it
with them, include detail and see what happens. If they choose to deviate
from the default by such a large degree that what is correctly written
and works with the default no longer works with them, the ball is in their
court.
If need be, tell them you'll accept patches. :)
Just my 2c.
