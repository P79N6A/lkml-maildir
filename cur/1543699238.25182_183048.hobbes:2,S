Within pdt x05 dvd/ cd, as contrasted with pdt x00 hdd/ flash, since
1999 we have an ansi t10 paper standard for a device to report bytes per
write block inequal to bytes per read block i.e. the 1999 mmc x0020
RandomWritable "feature" that describes a disc in a drive.
I haven't yet seen an fs run in Linux that bothers to fetch this plug 'n
play data, hence my op x46 GPCMD_GET_CONFIGURATION patches of
linux-scsi.

Google tells me cd-rw and dvd+rw likewise do not support random writing
without load balancing e.g.
http://fy.chalmers.se/~appro/linux/DVD
+RW/
http://fy.chalmers.se/~appro/linux/DVD
+RW/#udf
"... As you might know DVD+RW media can sustain only around 1000
overwrites. The thing about fully fledged file systems is that every
read [or tight bunch of 'em] is accompanied by corresponding i-node
update or in other words a write! ..."

Ick.
Naive read-modify-write to raise bytes-per-write-block passed-thru drops
thruput like 7X in the benchmarks I've seen.
