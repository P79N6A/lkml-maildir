..and points to commit 1a38416cea8ac801ae8f261074721f35317613dc which in 
turn talks about 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5651
 
Howerver, it seems that bugzilla entry may just be bogus. It talks about 
"it appears that some firmware in the future may depend on that sequence 
for correction operation"
Len, Shaohua, what are the real issues here? 
It would indeed be nice if we could just take CPU's down early (while 
everything is working), and run the whole suspend code with just one CPU, 
rather than having to worry about the ordering between CPU and device 
takedown.
That said, at least with STR, the situation is:
 1) suspend_console
 2)   device_suspend(PMSG_SUSPEND)	  (==   ->suspend)
 3)     disable_nonboot_cpus()
 4)       device_power_down(PMSG_SUSPEND) (==   ->suspend_late)
 5)         pm_ops->enter()
 6)       device_power_up()		  (==   ->resume_early)
 7)     enable_nonboot_cpus()
 8)     pm_finish()
 9)   device_resume()		          (==   ->resume
10) resume_console
So if we agree that things like timers etc should *never* be suspended by 
the early suspend, and *always* use "suspend_late/resume_early", then at 
least STR should be ok.
And I think that's a damn reasonable thing to agree on: timers (and 
anything else that CPU shutdown/bringup could *possibly* care about) 
should be considered core enough that they had better be on the 
suspend_late/resume_early list.
Thomas, Rafael, can you verify that at least STR is ok in this respect?
