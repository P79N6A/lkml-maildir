but with the AA design of default deny this isn't a big problem unless you 
specificly allow some network daemon to access /etc/.vi-shadow-1234
in this context passwd and vi are considered trusted processes, they are 
used _after_ you authenticate onto the box.
no, this won't help you much against local users, but there are a _lot_ of 
boxes out there with few, if any, local users who don't also have the root 
password. AA helps the admin be safer when configuring netwrok daemons.
