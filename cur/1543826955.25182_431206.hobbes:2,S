Looking through my rc.sysinit (pre-fc6), udev gets started after root is
mounted (I haven't looked at the initrd).
More than likely, something isn't compiled into the kernel (either left
as a module or left out entirely) that is required to access the root
volume.  Without the initrd, no modules can be loaded nor lvm started to
find the root volume.
Where is your root volume and which filesystem are you using.
