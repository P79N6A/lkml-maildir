I find the above bit somewhat misleading as it implies that the
!wbc->for_reclaim case can be removed after ecryptfs has similar fix
as unionfs. Can we just say that while BDI_CAP_NO_WRITEBACK does
prevent some callers from entering ->writepage(), it's just an
optimization and ->writepage() must deal with !wbc->for_reclaim case
properly?
