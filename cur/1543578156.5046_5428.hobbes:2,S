3) ask kernel developers to get rid of this "brk hits the fixed start
address of mmapped areas" or the other way around complaints "mmapped
area should start at lower address" limitation. E.g. Solaris does
growing up heap, growing down mmap and fixed size stack at the top.
Wayne, the patch below should fix your barrier problem [1 GB physical
memory configuration], I used only with 2.2 kernels. Your app should
complain about out of memory around 2.7 GB (0xb0000000-0x08??????),
but note that only 256 MB (0xc0000000-0xb0000000) left for shared
libraries, mmapped areas.
Good luck,
	Szaka
