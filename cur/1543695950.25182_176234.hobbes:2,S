There's a simple reason for what you see : this message was introduced in
2.4.21 to detect buggy hardware. Before 2.4.21, you only had the luck to
see time go backwards without any apparent reason. There was a very long
thread about gettimeofday() jumping backwards a few months ago in which
you may find detailed informations about this problem.
