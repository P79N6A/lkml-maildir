The only reason why the sysfs creation would fail is a kernel bug,
so the consequence of your proposal is in fact unfixed kernel bugs.
Plus, of course, a driver which doesn't offer the interfaces which
it is supposed to offer.
Now, we can talk about making those sysfs core functions generate warnings
themselves, and we can talk about generating new wrappers around them which
generate warnings and which return void, then migrating code over to use
those.
And we can also talk about blithely ignoring these errors and not telling
anyone about our bugs, but nobody should listen to such scandalous ideas.
