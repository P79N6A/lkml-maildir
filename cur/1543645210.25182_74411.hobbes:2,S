You got that wrong. It's not meant to be a torture on the user, but it's 
rather that NVdriver only works on kernels it was explicitly written for. 
Otherwise most things just won't match. That's where NVdriver uses to hit.
Please check again without ever loading the NVdriver. (i.e. from a clean 
reboot.)
