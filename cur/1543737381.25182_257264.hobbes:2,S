i didnt mean to imply anything negative about Slackware - it's a
borderline date of release when it could have been 2.6-ready (although
2.6 was not relased yet at that date ;) but not have new gcc yet. It is
a full and primary requirement of the kernel to run !pt_gnu_stack
binaries too - it just wasnt that well tested for a complete distro, for
the reasons i mentioned.
