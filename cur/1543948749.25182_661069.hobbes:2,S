Agreed.  In the early days of cpusets, (1) the less I put in the kernel,
the easier it was to get those first patches accepted, and (2) the more
there was that remained for me to code in user space, where my employer
could provide better, leading edge, products for a profit.
Overtime, these user space features that prove their worth, but that
were difficult to code in the most usable and robust manner in user
space, such as boot cpusets here, and, on another thread, cpuset
relative NUMA mempolicies, naturally migrate to the kernel, for wider
availability.
