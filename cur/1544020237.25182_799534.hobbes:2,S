I should have said "in this particular case", because it actually makes a
difference for devices using interrupt pins.  Namely, pcibios_enable_device()
additionally enables PCI resources (that may make a difference, but everything
should have been restored already) and sets up an interrupt link for the
device.  If the link has been set up already, which often is the case, it
increases a reference count and exits.
Now, this reference count is not used for anything, but it was supposed to be
used for disabling the interrupt links that are no longer needed.  This
mechanism is currently disabled, but if we enable it at one point (which may
be necessary to fix suspend-resume on some boxes), it won't work if
the "enable" calls are not balanced with "disable" ones.  IOW, for every
pcibios_enable_device() call there should be a complementary
pcibios_disable_device() call.  That's why I decided to put the
disable/enable things into the PCI core's suspend/resume code paths (also,
because pci_reenable_device() has been already there for driverless devices).
This might not be the right choice, but I don't really think it does break
things.
Anyway, from what I can tell reading your messages in this thread so far,
you seem to want the PCI core to:
(1) save the state of devices during suspend (avoid doing that if the driver has
    already saved the state),
(2) put devices into D0 during resume (early),
(3) restore the state of devices during resume (early).
Still, you don't want the core to disable devices during suspend and to enable
(or reenable) them during resume.
What about putting devices into low power states?  [Note that ACPI may be
necessary for this purpose.]
What about devices with no drivers and/or without suspend/resume support?
Do you want them to be disabled during suspend and enabled during resume by
the core?  [I guess you do, they have no interrupt handlers that may break
after all.]
Thanks,
