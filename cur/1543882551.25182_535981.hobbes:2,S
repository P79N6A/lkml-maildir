Subject: [patch 00/10]  mount ownership and unprivileged mount syscall (v5)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/27/180

v4 -> v5:
 - fold back Andrew's changes
 - fold back my update patch:
    o use fsuid instead of ruid
    o allow forced unpriv. unmounts for "safe" filesystems
    o allow mounting over special files, but not over symlinks
    o set nosuid and nodev based on lack of specific capability
 - patch header updates
 - new patch: on propagation inherit owner from parent
 - new patch: add "no submounts" mount flag
The last two patches are up for discussion.
The rest I think is in pretty good shape for merging.  If somebody
feels otherwise, please complain now.
