hello,
	I spent most of last night looking through the source
code of an embedded OS called eCos which has been released
under an open-source licence (similar to netscape's) by Cygnus.
(the people who do gcc-win32).  Anyway the code was written in
C++ which disappointed me, but I have to admit it looked like a
very clean interface.  If you think C++ is good for writing an OS
then you should consider porting this to whatever hardware you
have available (palmpilot maybe, or a PC).  Check it out at
www.cygnus.com.
As for C, it was written as a small portable language with a
close association to assembly, specifically for creating UNIX.
This 'change linux to C++' thread is a bit odd really. :)
cheers
Greg Smart
