No, we have a pretty good idea of ntfs now. But it is a complicated fs and 
when writing you need to take care of a lot of things simultaneously or you 
corrupt the volume. ntfs is organized as a transactional, relational 
database , hence there is a lot of book keeping involved in modifyin any 
structure. Even without supporting the journal (we will not support it at 
least initially...) almost all data is duplicated in various places and if 
you forget to update something somewhere when updating it elsewhere you 
basically make salad of the metadata and the probability is quite high that 
you end up killing the data on the volume either in part or completely...
Finally I am busy with my PhD and I have two part time jobs as well so I 
don't have much time to develop ntfs... As always with free software 
development, it goes slowly...
