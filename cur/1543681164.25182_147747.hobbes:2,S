Swapping these conditions improved the situation quite a lot.
Subjectively, I would say it's 90% better. By extending the read-ahead
cache to 32M, I can play the DVD almost perfectly with those conditions
(ABRT_ERR and MEDIUM_ERROR) swapped.  
Also, for the first time, I get messages of this sort in syslog:
Jul 13 22:22:47 joehill kernel: end_request: I/O error, dev hdc, sector 7865320
Jul 13 22:22:47 joehill kernel: Buffer I/O error on device hdc, logical block 983165
Before, the only sorts of errors I ever got were:
Jul 13 00:14:35 joehill kernel: hdc: cdrom_decode_status: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
Jul 13 00:14:35 joehill kernel: hdc: cdrom_decode_status: error=0x30LastFailedSense 0x03 
Jul 13 00:14:35 joehill kernel: hdc: ide_intr: huh? expected NULL handler on exit
Is there a reason these conditions should *not* be swapped? Is there
something I can test? Otherwise, my problem is basically fixed by this
change.
