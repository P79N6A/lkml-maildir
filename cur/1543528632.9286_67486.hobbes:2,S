Subject: IRQ/IO-APIC problem in pre-patch-2.3.50-1 ?

I've had this problem since pre-patch-2.3.49-2, and it's still there in
pre-patch-2.3.50-1. The kernel wont boot on my 486 UP system (SiS 85C496
chipset). It prints the message "Uncompressing Linux... Ok, booting the
kernel." and reboot.
The reason I think it's a IRQ/IO-APIC problem is, that if CONFIG_SMP=n and
CONFIG_X86_UP_IOAPIC=n the problem occur, but if CONFIG_SMP=y or
CONFIG_X86_UP_IOAPIC=y the kernel boots and works OK.
