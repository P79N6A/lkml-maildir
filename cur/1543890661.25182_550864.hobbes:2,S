Hi,
I have a "LSI Logic MegaRAID SCSI 320-4x" adapter with an external raid5
array of 5 Seagate ST336754LW and XFS as fs on it. The device in
question is /dev/sdb and the box is a dual Opteron 252.
I've recently started to see this in the log almost whenever I touch the
filesystem:

One of the drives in the array has been put offline after having seen
media errors. I'm waiting for a replacement but the recurring errors
worry me...
Any help/advises would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks a lot in advance,

PS: I'm running a distribution kernel, but having seen zero responses on
the gentoo list I dared to write here. The kernel is gentoo-sources
2.6.20-r8.
