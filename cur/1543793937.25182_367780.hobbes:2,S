yes, i tried to "modprobe" the compiled cls_u32 module. but the "make 
modules" errors are there anyway. i tried to compile a fresh 2.6.15-rc1 
on a different machine (where i can't do "modprobe") and the errors were 
there too:

despite of the errors on "make modules" i'll reboot with the "new" 
kernel asap.
