I really think it's best to leave it in.  It's harmless at the moment,
and readding it later will just create a massive amount of duplicate
work.    Sooner or later, I'm have little doubt that AMD can make this
feature work.

OK, if you'll take the patch, I'd be happy to do this :).  I'm
assuming that you mean I should force K8_NB = "yes" if MCE_AMD = "yes"
in .config.  Is that what you're asking for?
