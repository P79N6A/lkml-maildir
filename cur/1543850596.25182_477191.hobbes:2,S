one quick addition to this.  in arch/i386/kernel/traps.c, we have the
code snippet:
        if (eip < PAGE_OFFSET)
                return;
        if (probe_kernel_address((unsigned short __user *)eip, ud2))
                return;
        if (ud2 != 0x0b0f)
                return;
        printk(KERN_EMERG "------------[ cut here ]------------\n");
#ifdef CONFIG_DEBUG_BUGVERBOSE
        do {
                unsigned short line;
                char *file;
                char c;
                if (probe_kernel_address((unsigned short __user *)(eip + 2),
                                        line))
... etc etc ...
  if those pointers qualified by "__user" *aren't* actually addresses
into user space, that would seem to violate what i read in the book
"linux device drivers (3rd ed)", p. 50:
"This [__user] annotation is a form of documentation, noting that a
pointer is a user-space address that cannot be directly dereferenced.
For normal compilation, __user has no effect, but it can be used by
external checking software to find misuse of user-space addresses."
  under the circumstances, wouldn't this show up as one of those
misuses?
