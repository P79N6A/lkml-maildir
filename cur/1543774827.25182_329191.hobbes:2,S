Something I didn't make clear - the driver that I am adding is a pci
card based on the IOC3 serial part - it is a single function card - 2
serial ports. This is supported on Altix.
The driver that is in drivers/net is to support a (full) IOC3 card -
ethernet and serial ports. This is not supported on Altix. Only the
newer IOC4 is supported (it also has serial ports among other things).
They are two different pieces of hardware.
