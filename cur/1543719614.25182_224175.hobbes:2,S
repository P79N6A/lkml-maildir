I wasn't aware of the convention but it absolutely makes sense. If I find
the time, I'll go through the existing compat_sys_* handlers to see if they
all do sign-extension correctly. Note that on s390, we also need 31-bit
zero-extension for pointers, which is done in architecture-specific code.
Otherwise every compat_* syscall would need to use compat_uptr_t arguments
which appears unnecessarily ugly to me.
Also, what should be the conversion for positive signed arguments like the
futex 'op' value? Sign-extension would be the formally correct solution,
but simply using the zero-extended value (like we do in most places) works
just as well.
