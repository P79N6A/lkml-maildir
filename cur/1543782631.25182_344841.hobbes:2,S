Subject: [patch 16/18] remap_file_pages protection support: avoid truncating COW PTEs
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch may or may not be wanted. I took this from the original Ingo's
patch and improved it, but probably we want to keep this bug. However, I'm not
sure of what Ingo wanted to do.
If on a private writable mapping we call remap_file_pages() without
altering the file offset or the protections, after writing on the page to
create a COW mapping, with this patch we refuse reinstalling the old page, as
we should.
However, I'm not sure there's a point for an app to do this.
It is possible that we return an error even if the present page is already the
same one; however, that shouldn't be a big problem. In fact, the main purpose
of supporting private VMAs in remap_file_pages is allowing mmap(MAP_PRIVATE |
MAP_POPULATE) to work, and for that case existing mappings have already been
cleared and this patch is unneeded.
Note that this patch *needs* testing on each existing arch - I already got
subtle failures on i386 and not on UML on this patch (I had forgot to test
pte_present(), and pte_file() returned true, because _PAGE_DIRTY and
_PAGE_FILE share the same slot).
Setting CONFIG_DEBUG_PRIVATE in the test-program provides a mean to test this.
