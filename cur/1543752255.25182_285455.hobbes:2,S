Chris, I did comment on it, see
1105222442.24592.126.camel@krustophenia.net from around 5:15 on
Saturday.
from the above message:
Eh, PAM is a perfectly fine solution.  Documentation is lacking, but
it's easy to find examples.  On my system /etc/security/limits.conf has
this sample config, commented out:
#<domain>      <type>  <item>         <value>
#
#*               soft    core            0
#*               hard    rss             10000
#@student        hard    nproc           20
#@faculty        soft    nproc           20
#@faculty        hard    nproc           50
#ftp             hard    nproc           0
So add your audio users (or cdrecord users, or whoever) to group
realtime and add:
realtime        hard    memlock 100000
realtime        soft    prio    100
Problem solved.
Lee
