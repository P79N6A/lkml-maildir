One difference between the above and the 2.6 one you sent before is that
you don't seem to have rtc employed on 2.6:
           CPU0
  0:     626375    IO-APIC-edge  timer
  1:       1599    IO-APIC-edge  i8042
  2:          0          XT-PIC  cascade
  4:       1708    IO-APIC-edge  serial
  7:          2    IO-APIC-edge  parport0
 14:      19858    IO-APIC-edge  ide2
 15:       5220    IO-APIC-edge  ide3
 16:      30711   IO-APIC-level  nvidia
 18:       1799   IO-APIC-level  eth0, eth1
 19:     103365   IO-APIC-level  ide0, ide1, ehci_hcd:usb4, aic7xxx
 21:      47273   IO-APIC-level  uhci_hcd:usb1, uhci_hcd:usb2,
uhci_hcd:usb3
 22:       2782   IO-APIC-level  VIA8233
I don't expect this to be of any significance, but as Alan said you
never know... Another thing is that you are getting large number of
interrupts on the VIA device, whereas there is no any on 2.4. Does the
chipset get enabled differently? I wish I new VIA chipset, or had it,
will probably have to finally get some documentation on it.

Here I see that no fixups were applied to the chipset, and it seemed to
work just fine without them. I would experiment and turn fixups off, but
since this is a production system... Hmmm. 
Your previous trace for 2.6 with fixups:

Seeing actual IO-APIC setup in both cases would help, the ones you get
with apic=verbose, and you might have to provide full traces (as
attachment for example). It is somewhat comforting for me to know that
my patch is not affecting the outcome. But it is important to crack this
case of course. I think we need higher authority here, such as Bjorn, or
Alan...
