It was mistake.

I apologize 8) This piece was copied-n-pasted from tcp_v4_send_reset
and I was confused by their similarity.
Yes, certainly, it was broken. Andi fixes or already fixed it.

Acking data is main, but not the only function of ACKs.
One example is keepalive function as recommended by RFC1122,
keepalive ping is ACK out of window by 1. Though it warns
in the same place, that some broken stacks do not ACK bare ACKs 8)8)8)
                "Unfortunately, some misbehaved TCP implementations fail
                 to respond to a segment with SEG.SEQ = SND.NXT-1 unless
                 the segment contains data."
We do not want to be misbehaved. 8)8)8)
