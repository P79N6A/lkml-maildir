Subject: kiobuf functions and export problems for modules

Are the map_user_kiobuf and unmap_kiobuf functions intentionally not
exported, or should I submit a patch? I have a driver application that
it would best to implement with a module, rather than a special kernel
binary. I want to do scatter gather DMA out of userspace.
Thanks,
