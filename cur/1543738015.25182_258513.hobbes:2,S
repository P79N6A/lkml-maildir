Anil Kumar :
after booting system, I am loading my network device
driver module in linux kernel .
I wanna to know how much time is taking by functions
of my module at any time (i.e just after loading
module or just after sending or receiving data etc).
So I  can improve performance of my module by
improving those function which taking maximum time or 
cpu utilization.
