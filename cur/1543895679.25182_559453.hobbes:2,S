Because the user (under whose control the computer is, be it person or

What makes them lawful, given the "no further restrictions"?

As long as you didn't hand me the hardware along with the software,
for me to become a user of the software on that hardware, I agree.

Ok, I stand corrected.  They have that right.
However, since they distribute GPLed software along with the hardware,
such that I'd be a user of the software on that hardware, they should
not impose further restrictions on my freedoms that the GPL stands to
defend WRT the GPLed software.  So, they must not use their
authorization right to deny me, the user of the software, in the
hardware that they meant me to use the software, the freedom to adapt
the software for my own needs, and run it for any purpose.

No, because the user is not becoming a user of the software on their
own computers.  Only in the computer that was shipped along with the
software.

Yes, it would be, if it were so.

That's correct, as long as they didn't give me that hardware with
GPLed software in it.  The moment they do, I become recipient and user
of GPLed software in that computer, and they should relinquish their
power to impose restrictions on my exercise of the freedoms WRT that
software.  And there's no reason whatsoever to exclude restrictions
such as those implemented by means of authorization.

I see.  Good point.  Agreed.  That hardware is indeed special.  Per
the GPL, it's the only one in which the distributor must NOT exercise
any restraints whatsoever on my exercise of the freedoms.
Which in turns makes it non-special, in that, from the point of both
the distributor and the user, it becomes just like any other random
piece of hardware: the distributor doesn't limit the freedoms the user
had, and the user isn't limited in enjoying the freedoms she had.

It took me several attempts to understand what you meant.  Yes.  It's
special in that it can't be made special.  Poof, there goes the
universe ;-)

I'm talking about the implicit patent licenses that arise from
distributing software under GPLv2.

Yup.  And I get that right (because the distributor must not stop me)
when I receive software under the GPL along with the computer in which
I'm expected to use it.
