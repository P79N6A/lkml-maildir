Hi,
Here the current patches that rework load_balance_monitor.
The main reason for doing this is to eliminate the wakeups the thing generates,
esp. on an idle system. The bonus is that it removes a kernel thread.
Paul, Gregory - the thing that bothers me most atm is the lack of
rd->load_balance. Should I introduce that (-rt ought to make use of that as
well) by way of copying from the top sched_domain when it gets created?
