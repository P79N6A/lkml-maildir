No because patch(1) does that for you, it's one of the key features -
you can just save the message with a (non-mangled!) patch anywhere in
the text and the patch utility will do the right thing.  This is why
EOF, a .sig or whatever, before or after the patch is OK, *as long as
the mailer did not alter the patch itself*.
