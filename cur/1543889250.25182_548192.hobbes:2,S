I'll look but there didn't seem to be an obvious pattern when I last looked.

This board doesn't have any onboard video so that helps. I am running
with 2GB of memory.
I can put a card with similar chip in an X1 slot, and there are no
problems.  Same driver, but different bridges, and slightly different
Marvell chip.
