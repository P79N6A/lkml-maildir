Thats a hard problem. Since your scan is non atomic and because you have
directory notifications a running processes can have the setuid apps can
move the setuid bits around the file system to hide from you.

Being able to give process trees a file system view which has certain 
capability raising properties removed is basically the existing
capability mechanism but with a cleaner interface and more powerful
semantics.
Doing that with just mount properties and using them to revoke rights
works for me. There is a vfs corner case (clearly the setuid bit of a
file that isnt setuid from this namespace point of view) which is very
very important but not hard to get right.
