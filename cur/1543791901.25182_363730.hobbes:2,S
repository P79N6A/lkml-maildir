Hi James, Michael, all,

I understand the idea, but I don't like the implementation. Why did you
add the initialization code to ds1337_set_datetime, rather than to
ds1337_init_client where is seems to belong?
Also, the initialization loop is way less efficient than it could be,
given the fact that the DS1337 autoincrements its address register on
write. You could at least use i2c_smbus_write_byte (instead of
i2c_smbus_write_byte_data), but even more efficient would be a block
transfer, like the ds1337_set_datetime function use.
Care to respin a patch?
Thanks,
