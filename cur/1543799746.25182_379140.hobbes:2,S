I was missing the following part. Sorry.

Ah, I see. However, it is intended to use as ->release() handler.
So, I updated the patch as following.
+int fs_flush_sync_fdata(struct inode *inode, struct file *filp)
+{
+	int err = 0;
+
+	if (IS_FLUSH(inode) && filp->f_mode & FMODE_WRITE) {
+		current->flags |= PF_SYNCWRITE;
+		err = filemap_write_and_wait(filp->f_mapping);
+		current->flags &= ~PF_SYNCWRITE;
+	}
+	return err;
+}
