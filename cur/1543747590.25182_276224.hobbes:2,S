We have similar "broken due to historical reasons" in other places. 
There's no good way to fix them up, and it doesn't really matter _what_ 
fake type you use, as long as it happens to be the same size as the 
original broken type on all architectures where it matters.
We've done different things in the past depending on exactly what the
numbers have been. Sometimes "size_t" (to keep pointers happy on both
32-bit and 64-bit architectures), sometimes "int" or "u32" (when somebody
had used an array _member_ instead of the array, or just had the size
explicitly haldcoded as an integer number, and then "size_t" just made it
"sizeof(int)" etc).
Sounds like it doesn't much matter in this case, any of the above would 
work.
