Thanks for the tip. For the major part (don't speaking about /kbin or
something like that), I think the change would be more a way to see the
stuff than a lot of coding changes. In this case, having always and a
sole kernel root, will allow to mount all sort of fs (virtual or not),
and to allow kernel threads to refere to this unchanged root.
Cheers,
