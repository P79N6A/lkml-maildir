The only stuff that reaches the MMC drivers is the scatter list. So
anything that operates on the request queue or any other block layer
specifics is probably out of the question since it breaks the abstraction.
Doesn't seem like a generic solution is easily implemented. I'll start
hacking together some way of specifying that highmem isn't supported so
that mmc_block can indicate this to the block layer.
