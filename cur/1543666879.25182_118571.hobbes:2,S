My problem is with the fix for 2.4.x; last I checked, XFree86 et al 
should not be surrounded by square brackets, such as is the case now:
brad      1625  0.0  0.5  3080 1448 ?        S    17:16   0:01 [fam]
root      1942  2.2 16.7 308692 42896 ?      S    17:16   1:21 [X]
brad      1968  0.0  0.6  3644 1720 ?        S    17:17   0:00

etc.
