Yes, this is true.  Red Hat installer guys grumbled at me when I wrote 
the 'sx8' block driver:  since it wasn't hda/sda, they had to write 
special code for it, as they apparently must do for any new block driver 
"class".  SuSE and other distros are probably similar, since each block 
driver provides its own special behaviors and feature exports.
I should have spoken up a long time ago about this, but anyway:
An IBM hypervisor on ppc64 communicates uses SCSI RPC messages.  I think 
this would be quite nice for Xen, because SCSI (a) is a message-based 
model, and (b) implementing block using SCSI has a very high Just 
Works(tm) value which cannot be ignored.  And perhaps (c) SCSI target 
code already exists, so implementing the server side doesn't require 
starting from scratch, but rather simply connecting the Legos.
