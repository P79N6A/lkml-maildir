That only changed the local variable, and not the pagetable entry.

Please, do some good runtime testing.  Write a script to monitor the
overall working set, run it for some sample workloads (your X server or
mozilla would be good choices).  Share the results with us so we can marvel
at the efficiency of modern applications.  Include these examples in the
changelog.
Also, we will need to do tlb writeback and invalidation prior to this
operation.  Documentation/cachetlb.txt has details.
