HT is not the same thing as SMP; while the chip may appear to be two
processors, it is actually equivalent 1.1 to 1.3 processors, depending on
the application.
Multicore processors and true SMP systems are unlikely to become mainstream
consumer items, given the premium price charged for such systems.
That given, I see some value in a stripped-down, low-overhead,
consumer-focused Linux that targets uniprocessor and HT systems, to be used
in the typical business or gaming PC. I'm not sure such is achievable with
the current config options; perhaps I should try to see how small a kernel I
can build for a simple ia32 system...
