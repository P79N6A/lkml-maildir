Don't read that as "existing capabilities don't work," but as 
"capabilities don't exist for all the things people claim they need 
setuid root to do." The whole concept of capabilities was going to 
reduce the need and demand for setuid, and hopefully allow setuid to 
vanish in secure systems.
Either through lack of all the necessary bits, or lack of expertise 
using them the goal of reduction in demand and use for setuid seems not 
to have been met. I would argue that lack of need has been met, but 
careful thought seems needed to do some things without setuid.
