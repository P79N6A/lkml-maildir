Hi...
I don't know if this is the right list to talk about this
but Im haveing some problems with pthread's.
Im trying some things out and if I run a large amount of
threads that are read/writeing to a shared data area with
mutex locks och mutex cond's it hangs at some placeses.
I have traced it to the function pthread_cond_broadcast so
I changed that to pthread_cond_signal at it worked better but
not 100%...
It seams to hang when its going to signal som other thread and
take 100% cpu and just sits there.
I was just wondering if someone else has come across this "problem"
and/or if there is some problem with pthread in general.
Im useing:
	Debian 2.0
	egcs g++
	glibc
	2.0.36
	pII 333
