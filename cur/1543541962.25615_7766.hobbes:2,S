We ran AIM benchmarks on an 32 processor Origin 2000.  The results as
expected differ wildly between compute bound benchmarks which as expected
for a ccNUMA machine scale perfectly and OS intensive workloads such as
the AIM SHM benchmark.  So in other words without knowing your particular
load pattern an anwer can't be given.
