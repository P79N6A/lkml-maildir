Thanks for the feedback Christoph,
Here a couple of short replies:

OK, this is the second time the issues comes up, so I'll add the
following just above the #if:
/* Don't set this to "1" unless you really know what you're doing */
#define LTT_UNPACKED_STRUCTS 0

OK.

This macro is only there so that someone could insert a trace point like
this in his code:
 TRACE_EVENT(MY_ID, MY_DATA)
If trace_event() is used as-is in the code then the kernel fails to build
if tracing is disabled. If the macro is used, instead, then the kernel
builds fine and no code is added because the TRACE_EVENT() macro is:
#define TRACE_EVENT(ID, DATA)
when tracing is disabled.
Note that this macro is actually never used in the current patches. It's
only there for completeness. The actual macros being used are much more
specific (TRACE_FILE_SYSTEM(), TRACE_SCHECHANGE(), etc.)

Sure.

Yes. Actually we already do have asm/trace.h. We'll push those #if's in
there instead of having them in linux/trace.h.
Thanks again, the next update will include these changes.
