The alternative is to just add a simple list into the task_struct and the
head of it into mm_struct. Then, at fork, you just finish the fork() with
	list_add(p->mm_list, p->mm->thread_list);
and do the proper list_del() in exit_mm() or wherever.
You'll still loop in /proc, but you'll do the minimal loop necessary.
