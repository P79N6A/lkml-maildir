PTRACE_SYSEMU and PTRACE_SYSEMU_SINGLESTEP are implemented in a different
way (see kernel/ptrace.c), which does not require that assembly code.  
(It also works for free on other arch's if you want to #define the
constants there.)
Do you have a test case for PTRACE_SYSEMU that does not work right?
Thanks,
Roland
