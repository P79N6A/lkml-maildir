Why? If you do an embedded system you go for minimal memory.
You'd probably compile a kernel without module support. You know
which hardware is to be supported, so you gain nothing at all
by using modules.
Frankly, even for a normal system, why compile an initrd for drivers
you need during everyday operation? If you compile yourself at all, why
pay the price in memory and TLB misses?
