And they give you the same right that they had, which is obtain free software 
that you can modify and redistribute. There's nothing in there that says they 
should give you the tools they used after they received the software, which 
is what you seem to be looking for.

It does, can't you modify their kernel source? Where does it say you should be 
able to run you modifications on the same hardware?

The only fear that I have with the whole Tivo saga, is that companies like 
Dell can use the same thing to say: "Our hardware will only run Company's X 
distribution of Linux". 
Do we just hope users won't buy those Dell machines, or do you modify your 
software license to force Dell to allow custom distributions to run on their 
machines? Then where do we draw the line of "Software Licenses".
