Oh, I know SMART is implemented, although I haven't actually seen/used a
tool which takes advantage of it (do you have such a thing?).  It would
be nice if there were messages appearing in my syslog (just like the
AIX days) which said "there were 10 temporary read errors at block M on
drive X yesterday" and "1 permanent write error at block M, block remapped
on drive X yesterday", so I would know _before_ my drive craps out
after all of the remapping table is full, or the temporary read errors
become permanent.  (I have a special interest in that because my laptop
hard drive sounds like a jet engine at times... ;-).
What I was originally suggesting is that it have a field which can report
to the user that "there were 800 sync/reset operations because of power
drops that were later found not to be power failures".  That is what
I was suggesting SMART report in this case (actual power failures are
not interesting).  Note also, that this is purely hypothetical, based
on only a vague understanding on what actually happens when the drive
thinks it is losing power, and only ever having seen the hex output
of /proc/ide/hda/smart_{values,thresholds}.
Being able to get a number back from the hard drive that it is performing
poorly (i.e. synchronous I/O + lots of resets) because of a bad power supply
is exactly what SMART was designed to do - predictive failure analysis.
Cheers, Andreas
