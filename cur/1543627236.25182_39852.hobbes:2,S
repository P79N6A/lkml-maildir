A little plea for mercy for this tiny bit :)
Could we keep PG_slab around unless its really causing trouble ? It
makes life easier for some things we do ... Also its rather nice that
today as a result of a wide usage of
slab infrastructure in the kernel, one can easily/directly interpret the
contents of 
almost any arbitrary memory location in the kernel, if its a slab page,
as one knows what type of data it contains.
