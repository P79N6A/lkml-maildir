the mtest01 -p may comparing apples to oranges. Please make sure to apply
the -p fix I posted in the last days before using the -p option,
otherwise the amount of memory swapped out will be random. In this case
the -aa run was a little penalized for example (not much but since the
difference is of the order of seconds ...).
thanks!
