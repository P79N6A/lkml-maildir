It depends on what you're talking about... if it's just the do_mount.c 
and mount-root-filesystem code, that code gets unlinked and removed from 
RAM completely after the kernel booting completes.
If it's other filesystem data you want hanging around after boot 
completes, check out my reply to Miles... it's doable.
