Hi Alan,
I've compiled a plain 2.2.18 kernel for the HP NetServer this afternoon,
and guess what ? (ok, I know that you guessed) : the netraid card now works
correctly.
BTW, I noticed that the firmware and bios versions are improperly displayed
(only garbage). According to the code, that's because the identification
method differs between HP and others, so the HP method is disabled for now.
but this one will be wrong too because the major number is taken from
productInfo->FwVer[1]>>8 (which is an u8), instead of >>4.
I hope that tomorrow I will have a bit of time to try to clarify this and make
it display the right version, and properly identify an HP (fwver[0] seems not
to be used on them).
Cheers,
Willy
