Hello,
I've released a new snapshot of the uClinux/ColdFire toolchain
based on GCC 3.3.2 and GCC 3.4-prerelease:
  
http://www.uclinux.org/pub/uClinux/uclinux-elf-tools/gcc-3/
This release incorporares quite a lot of updates and fixes
since the last official announcement.
Changes in release 20031102:
    * Update GCC to 3.3.2 and 3.4-20031029;
    * Update binutils to version 2.14.90.0.7;
    * Finished integrating uClinux and ColdFire support in
      official GCC and binutils. The 3.4 toolchain now builds
      with no patches except for some pending GCC 3.4 bugfixes;
    * Use self-extracting archives for all binary packages;
    * Fix GCC 3.4 packaging problem (thanks to Frank Baumgart).
Changes in release 20031006:
    * Most ColdFire and uClinux patches are now incorporated
      in the official GCC 3.4 snapshots.
    * Update GDB to 6.0, with new BDM patches.
    * Update uClibc to 0.9.21.
    * Enable pthreads support in uClibc (lightly tested).
    * Split binary distribution in three packages (base, C++ and GDB).
    * Several bugfixes all over the build script and patches.
Changes in release 20030811:
    * Upgraded GCC 3.3.1 to the official release;
    * Update links for GCC 3.4 to really point at the 20030806
      snapshot.
Changes in release 20030808:
    * uClibc multilibs for -msep-data were being built as
      shared libraries (reported by Chen Qi).
    * Update elf2flt from uClinux CVS and drop all patches.
    * Update GCC 3.4 snapshot to 20030806. Fixes problems with -MD,
      builds kernel, breaks libstdc++ multilibs (still investigating).
    * Apply small fixes to GCC 3.4 patchset.
    * Integrate GDB 5.3 with BDM support
    * Restore building GCC 3.3.1 (got broken in previous release)
    * Test with GCC 2.95.3: surprisingly, it still builds fine...
