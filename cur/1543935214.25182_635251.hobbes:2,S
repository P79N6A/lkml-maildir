  Actually there are two problems. The first one is calls from userspace
beyond s_maxbytes. Those can be (and are) easily handled. But then there
are places inside VFS which compute things like maximal page index in the
file (and they compute it regardless the actual place where we access the
file). These computations can overflow even if the access is perfectly
within s_maxbytes and cause nasty things. That's why I've introduced that
i_size_read_trunc() function and we really need to fix them somehow for
OCFS2 or we have to make sure that these functions are never called on
files larger than s_maxbytes. I'll try to come up with more obvious
alternative to i_size_read_trunc() and if I fail I'll investigate how hard
it would be to handle the problems inside OCFS2.
