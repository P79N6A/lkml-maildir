Hey all.
Recently I've been PXE booting a lot of Linux boxen from a remote
location, and accessing them through a Perle CS9000 console server.
Under 2.2.19 I've had absolutely no probs, but I upgraded the image to
2.4.8 last night. It all appeared to work, except that nothing I TYPE
appears to hit the machine.
I suspect it's because the CS9000 is operating with no flow control.
But I've got no idea what's changed between 2.2.19 and 2.4.8 that could
affect it :)
Anyone have any ideas?
