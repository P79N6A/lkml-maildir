Yes, it should not be, but MAY be.
The lp.h contains the incorrect line yet:
#define LP_PINTEN       0x10  /* high to read data in or-ed with data out */
                                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^???
(At least in 2.2.7)
And IMHO if there is one duplicated symbol there may be two also.

Ooops! I've just understood, that this comment is totally bad even for
the 0x20 bit. If bit 0x20 is 0 the input and output will be AND-ed.
Otherwise the output drives does high-impedance state and does not
interfere with the input.
