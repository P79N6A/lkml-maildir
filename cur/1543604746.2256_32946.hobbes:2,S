Certainly :-)
http://www.codemonkey.org.uk/cruft/ewbe.c
 is a quick and dirty hack.
You'll need the msr driver loaded, and the /dev node there.
I've not tested this code as my K6-2 box is currently in bits, but
it should be ok. Bits 2 & 3 in 0xc0000080 do the magic, so theres not
much that could be wrong.. If all else fails, double check the spec.
Let me know if this does anything for you at all
(regarding both temperature, and performance)
Oh, and for everyone else, as the comment in the source says,
don't run this on anything that isn't a K6-2 / K6-3.
I was too lazy to add cpuid checking to this. Maybe I'll do that
later..
regards,
Dave.
