Exactly. You are ONLY blocking "duff instructions" to workaround bug in
hardware. You are not trying to standardtize life.
Why not add filters in fs/exec.c so only "good commands" can be executed ?
And when new program is developed you "only" need to get approval in
"linux-programs committee": kernel only need to know that it's now safe
to execute gcj - it's safe "GNU Java Compiler", not some malicious code.
What's the difference ? There are exist "standard" commands (see POSIX)
and there are conutless "vendor-specific extensions". Why not limit itself
to standard commands and to not change standard when new program is wanted ?
You can destroy not only HDD but a lot more with malicious or buggy setuid
program in typical system.
