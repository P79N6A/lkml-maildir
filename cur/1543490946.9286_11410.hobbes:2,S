XF68_FBDev should work just fine, but it is non-accelerated.  Running
another (accelerated) X-Server like XF86_SVGA might or might not work.
It depends on X-Server and graphics board.
The X-Server must restore the video mode correctly, else you end up
with a broken console (and vesafb cannot do anything about this).
the above is from Documentation/fb/vesafb.txt
