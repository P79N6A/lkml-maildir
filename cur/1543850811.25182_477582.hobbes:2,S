Well ... if you used configfs as an interface to resource
controllers, as you said was easily done, then they would
have something to do with each other, right ;)?
Choose the right data structure for the job, and then reuse

Neither avoid nor encouraging code reuse is the key question.
What's the best fit, long term, for the style of kernel-user
API, for this use?  That's the key question.
