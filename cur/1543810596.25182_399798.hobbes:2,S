'Scuse my noobness, but when I supply the following parameter to the arguments 
  of my kernel through GRUB, I get an 'undefined mode' error:
vga=0164
But then, when the prompt comes up asking me which mode I want I type in:
0164
and I get the required mode!
What's happening?  On 2.4 kernel, I used to boot with vga=0x0a (which is the 
same mode as 0164) and it would boot fine.  Not anymore...
Help?
