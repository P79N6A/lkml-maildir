That's a very poor performance.  The first thing to do is check the
specs on the drive.  What's the spindle speed and what's the average
number of sectors per track.  From this you can make a guess about the
likely throughput.  It is possible that 4.5MB/s is the limit on that
piece of hardware.  If you find that the limit should be more like
10MB/s, check the configuration of the SCSI controller in the bios.
Also, look at the /proc/scsi data.  I think I have a motherboard with
similar specs and I get 10MB/s from Quantum VikingII drives, 35MB/s in
a 4 drive RAID configuration.
