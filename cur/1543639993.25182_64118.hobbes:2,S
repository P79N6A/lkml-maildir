I've been thinking about doing away with balance_irq on P4 boxes by using the 
TPR.  It might even help P3 and other i386 CPUs by routing interrupts 
preferentially to idle CPUs.  And, it would do it in real time, not as a 
snapshot of the past stored in the I/O APIC's dest masks.
What do you think about this?  (Crudely ripped out of my 2.5 summit patch; may 
not apply correctly.)
The code in do_IRQ could be "if (clustered_apic_mode) apic_adj_tpr(TPR_IRQ)" 
or some such, if that kind of APIC foolery is not considered necessary for 
the non-P4 crowd.  (The automatic priority boost for serial APICs with 
unEOIed interrupts should do the job for us.)
