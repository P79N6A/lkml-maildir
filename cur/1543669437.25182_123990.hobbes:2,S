the cpu starvation issues seem to have cleared a little, but i'm still
seeing issues.
everytime a larger process wakes up, like java gc (jboss) or xfree86
server (especially while switching desktops), mpg123 and/or esd's
audio output gets interrupted and pops.  vmstat shows no swapping,
just spikes in user cpu.  while rapidly switching desktops, audio can
be delayed for seconds at a time, interrupt count drops slightly (i
guess since no audio), and context switches can double.
are there proc knobs to adjust to alleviate this?
