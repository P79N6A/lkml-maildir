Ok.. update:
I've testet some more kernels. I started with 2.4.0 which did boot, so did 
2.4.2 and 2.4.3.
With 2.4.4 it won't boot. The last message is 
Ok, now booting the kernel.
Which of the changes from 2.4.4 could cause this ?
Every other kernel higher then 2.4.4 that i tried (2.4.5, 2.4.10, 2.4.19, 
2.5.31) are having the same problem.
I am completly stuck. the ram is ok, the onboard graphic adapter seems ok too 
(trying to boot with another agp card doesnt help)
