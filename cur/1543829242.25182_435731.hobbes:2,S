The filtering on privilege level is too coarse. For example want to 
start event counting on entry into a kernel function and stop when 
exiting the function. The itanium hw is not ideal for this application. 
The children functions may not be contiguous with the starting function. 
  Other kinds of predication based on state information, e.g. particular 
process or thread could be very useful.

One probably could configure the performance monitoring hardware from 
userspace. However, for micro-measurement in the kernel it seems like 
the pmu reads in kernel space would still be required.
