So which is correct?

But your post contradicts itself.  It can't be correct.

I think those "part 2" messages aren't caused by the kernel at all, but
instead by some program running on your computer.  You could try
booting into single-user mode and see if the behavior changes.
Also there's no question -- the device does behave strangely.  It
shouldn't change the write-protect setting all by itself.
