No, I couldn't seem to get that to show up in a yumex display, and I'm 
partial to smart anyway.

You didn't tell me this.
That said, I am booted to the patch you sent me now, and this also is a 
very obvious improvement, one I could easily live with on a long term 
basis.  I haven't tried a kernel build in the background yet, but I have 
sat here and played patience for about an hour, looking for the little 
stutters, but never saw them.  So I could just as easily recommend this 
one for desktop use, it seems to be working.  tvtime hasn't had any audio 
or video glitches that I've noted when I was on that screen to check on 
an interesting story, like the 102 year old lady who finally got her hole 
in one, on a very short hole, but after 90 years of golfing, she was 
beginning to wonder if she would ever get one.  Not sure who bought at 
the 19th hole, HNN didn't cover that traditional part.
So this patch also works.  And if it gets into mainline, at least Con's 
efforts at proding the fixes needed will not have been in vain.
My question then, is why did it take a very public cat-fight to get this 
looked at and the code adjusted?  Its been what, nearly 2 years since 
Linus himself made a comment that this thing needed fixed.  The fixes 
then done were of very little actual effectiveness and the situation then 
has gradually deteriorated since.
Its on the desktop that linux will win or lose the public's market share.  
After all, there are only so many 'servers' on the planet, a market that 
linux has pretty well demo'ed its superiority, if not in terms of speed, 
at least in security.
To qualify that, I currently have 2 of yahoo's machines in 
my .procmailrc's /dev/null list as they are a source of a large number of 
little 1 to 3 line spams.  I assume they are IIS machines, but the emails 
headers aren't that explicit to my relatively untrained eyeballs.
And I'd like to see korea put on a permanent rbl black hole.  I'm less 
than amused at watching the log coming out of my router as first one 
shithead and then the next makes a 100,000 word dictionary attack against 
it.  One has even found a way too cause a tcp reset about every 10 words 
tried.  But nobody has gotten any farther than that.  That knocking 
sound?  Guess.
