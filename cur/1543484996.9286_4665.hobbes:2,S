Realistically, all you need to do to _not_ screw up binary module
compatibility to do this 'move' is:
	1) make a vfs_generic_rename() function which is exported
by the kernel (for use in FS modules)
	2) DO NOT change the inode_operations structure at all
	3) Change the vfs rename() system call to check if the
inode_operations rename() function is NULL, and if so have it call
the vfs_generic_rename()
	4) Remove the FS-specific rename functions from the filesystems
which can use the generic method.
The result of this is that the kernel interfaces do not change (adding
a new interface does not consitute a change in the interface), but you
get the added benefit that the filesystem itself can decide whether it
wants to use the generic code or implement rename itself.
I don't see this as being a major problem, assuming it is done
"right."  I can only assume that you do not plan to remove the
rename() inode_operation.
If you do plan to actually _change_ the inode_operation, please wait
until 2.3.
