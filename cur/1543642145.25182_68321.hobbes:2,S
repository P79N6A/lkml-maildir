Define "work".  hdparm -d1 doesn't just work, it requires making sure that 
the drive and interface are properly programmed to the correct transfer rates 
first (read as: hdparm -d1 can be Bad).  Using the kernel defaults is much 
better as the probe code will make sure that everything is setup correctly.  
Andre can provide more details and help fix things if it doesn't actually 
work for your drive.

You might need to upgrade from the -3 kernel (several errata have 
been released) as there were a few known problems with some network 
drivers, as well as NFS and ext3.  Different drives also have varing 
amounts of cache, and it might be this that you're noticing.

Again, try a newer kernel.  I'm using a C-Media at home and it works 
pretty well for ogg/DVD playback.
