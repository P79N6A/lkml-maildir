IA64 Linux had non-executable stack/data before PT_GNU_STACK was invented.
It's keyed off a ELF header flags bit:
/* Least-significant four bits of ELF header's e_flags are
   OS-specific.  The bits are interpreted as follows by Linux: */
#define EF_IA_64_LINUX_EXECUTABLE_STACK 0x1
I guess I never quiet understood why an entire program header is
needed for this, but that's just me.
