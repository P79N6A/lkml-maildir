I'm sorry not to agree with you, but with the high number of messages, not
everyone has the time to catch them all. It has happened that I missed a
thread for several days, and noticed it while being quite advanced in the
discussion (OK, I'm not a kernel tree maintainer, but I'm interested in
what's being done). And I didn't notice this XFree patch either, and I
read nearly all messages. You're lucky if you have all this time to spare
here, really.
