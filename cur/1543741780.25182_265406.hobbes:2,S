Open Source projects produce excellent tools too. But I'll take your
word for it that there was no other way. The thing is, and I'm afraid
that many among your criticasters do not get this -- even with Linus
saying it over and over again: trying to refrain people from using the
software they want to use has nothing to do with freedom.
BK's license, the language used to write it, Larry's face, or all of
the above, are absolutely *no* justification for the way some of you
come down on Larry.  If you think the BK license interferes in a bad
way with Linux development and you can back it up with solid reasoning
or facts, you might have a point and you should speak up (or start
coding)-- probably using another soapbox, by the way. And drop the
attitude.
Otherwise, what tools other people use is no business of yours. If
that thought bothers you, rethink whether you are really part of a
community that cares deeply about freedom.
Larry, thanks for what's obviously a great piece of software.
Cheers,
Buddy
