AIUI the task_cache is meant to prevent certain task_t (dear gawd I
can't stand those _struct suffixes) refcounting pathologies because
the task_t has its final put done by the task itself or something
on that order, so it may be better for ia64 to adapt the task_cache to
their purposes instead of wiping it entirely. Also, making the
task_cache treatment uniform apart from its declaration would allow the
#ifdef to be shoved in a header.
Alternatively, one could alter the timing of the final put on a task_t
so as to handle it similarly to the final mmput() (though here, too it
might be more sightly to #ifdef the necessary bits in headers).
I think there are already outstanding task_t refcounting bugs, so I'm
not entirely sure where we stand wrt. changing final put mechanics.
