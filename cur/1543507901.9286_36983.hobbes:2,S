Another victim of the knfsd morass..  For reliable operation, you really
should:
- Download, build and install HJ Lu's latest utilities package:
ftp://ftp.varesearch.com/pub/support/hjl/knfsd/knfsd-1.4.7.tar.gz
- Apply the following patches included with that package to the kernel:
linux-2.2.7-sunrpc.patch
nfsd-2.2.7-3.patch
nfsd-2.2.7-nfsfh.patch
nfsd-2.2.7-2.lockd.patch
Life should then improve considerably.  I've given up trying to understand
why these are not in the base kernel, so don't ask...
