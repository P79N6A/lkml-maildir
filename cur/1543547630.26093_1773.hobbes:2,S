OK, I decided to do it, since it gave me a chance to tweak two people
in the nose, one who really earned it and one who probably should know
better. It is up on my web page and may be used and copied freely by
anyone whose email service does not have Earthlink.net black holed.
(Somebody who himself has an email service which black holes messages
foamed at the mouth at another, a major figure in the community, whose
email service blocked the first somebody's email. I thumb my metaphorical
nose at both of them. {^_-} I figure it is really a meaningless gentle jibe but
who am I to waste an opportunity?)

Um, no links, yet, from or to the main page. It is mostly straight text
suitable for cutandpaste.
Enjoy - I hope.
