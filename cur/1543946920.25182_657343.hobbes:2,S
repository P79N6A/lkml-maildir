I'll put in my long list of TODOs. I started looking at it yesterday again and
here are my early thoughts
1. We could create something similar to mem_map, we would need to handle 4
different ways of creating mem_map.
2. On x86 with 64 GB ram, if we decided to use vmalloc space, we would need 64
MB of vmalloc'ed memory
I have not explored your latest suggestion of pfn <-> memory controller mapping
yet. I'll explore it and see how that goes.
