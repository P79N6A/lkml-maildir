I believe Intel's icc builds the kernel, and tinycc previously built a subset 
of the kernel.  The pcc and llvm/clang projects are getting close to being 
able to build the kernel.  Ever since c99 came out, lots of gcc-isms with c99 
equivalents have been swapped over, most of the rest is testing.

Please show me A) the standard perl implements, B) the second implementation 
of that standard ala IETF guidelines.

I'm glad you think my Firmware Linux project is a work of art, but if you'd 
like to hear directly from my users I can ask them to complain at you in 
person, if you like.  I'm not sure what that would prove, though.
When cross compiling, it's good to have as constrained an environment as 
possible, because otherwise bits of the host system leak into the target 
system.  If you don't tightly control your cross compiling environment, it 
won't work.  That's just about an axiom in embedded development.
I know every single dependency my system has.  I can list them, explicitly.  I 
did this because it's very _USEFUL_ in this context.
Add perl scripts that call cpan, and this is no longer true.
