I think this is a different (albeit apparently valid) problem.  In my case
MS_ACTIVE (in iput() below) will be set since I am not unmounting a volume
and so I believe iput() will return immediately after adding the inode to
the unused list.
That said, I have added your patch to my test setup in case it helps.
Thanks,
Chris
