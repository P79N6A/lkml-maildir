I'm not really sure, what you're asking for. Select() is interruptible.
But: if you have multiple threads, the signal may be delivered to any
thread. So, what you may see, is, that the signal is delivered to a
thread, but the signaled thread is not the thread waiting in the
select() call.
Therefore it _seems_, as if select() is not interruptible, but it
surely is.
Regards, Olaf.
