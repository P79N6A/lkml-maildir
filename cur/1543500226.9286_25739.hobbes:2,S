As to the Alpha, I look in /usr/src/linux/MAINTAINERS and I see no one
listed for Alpha.  Meaning, there is no one point person to feed changes
to Linus.  This is not true for a lot of other archs (I checked Sparc and
Mips and m68k).  Now, this doesn't mean that these archs are necessarily
synced.  Linus runs an x86.  Therefore, this is what he tests on.  He
takes arch specific changes and if they are trivial enough, he will port
them to the other architectures.  But, to be honest, most of the time
these changes require a better knowledge of what goes on with that
platform.  One person can't know everything (even if they are Linus who is
getting close to that God status :)

2.2.8 was a bad release.  Granted.  But, with these compile errors, how
can they be fixed unless they are given on linux-kernel.  I don't think
that people can read your mind.

I'm not going to go into this one.  Check the recent (and reasonably long)
thread on the subject.  But with the wait_queue changes, they weren't just
a problem for pcmcia, a TON of drivers had a problem.  That's why it was
done in 2.3.x.  The minor version is odd, meaning it is developmental.
Let me quote from /usr/src/linux/README
	Linux version 2.3 is a DEVELOPMENT kernel, and not intended for
	general public use.  Different releases may have various and
	sometimes severe bugs.
So, you have been warned.

The plan is for ALSA to become the sound system over the course of 2.3.x.
According to the alsa mailing list, Jaraslov is starting to work on that
now for the merge with Alan who will then upstream it to Linus.

Would you rather the syntax error be fixed and then have fat cause
filesystem corruption?  The page cache code changed majorly in 2.3.7 (and
with warning from Linus in the announcement and after 10 pre-patches).
Even in 2.3.8, I am still getting some file corruption when messing with
large files.  Once this gets worked out, the other file systems will be
fixed.  Read my quote above from /usr/src/linux/README

No, Linus does not.  The main testing is done by the people who run it.
Which is why pre-patches exist (see the thread Linux versioning scheme).
I understand that this may be iffy running on a production system, so have
a devel machine that closely mirrors a production system.  Come up with a
way to test against it which simulates the actual load experienced by your
servers to see if you have any problems.

Then don't change .config.  Linus tests the compile with his .config and
then is nice enough to even include it for you :)  Seriously though, 2.2.X
is pretty stable on x86 (I didn't experience any of this weird stuff that
some people have and which is not being easily reproducible in 2.2.9/10).
But, this is what open development is all about.  Linux developers don't
have huge test labs of machines that they test everything on before a
release (like some os developers) and it runs on a HUGE range of hardware,
not a small set like some other operating systems.

Why does it freeze?  Do you have an oops?  Have you reported this to l-k.
A bug fix is not a reason to use 2.3.x; it should be backported (and
figured out what actually fixed it if this is not known).  The function
renaming in some cases is a "good thing" because it prevents greater
breakage by something compiling and therefore being in the "should work
fine" category.

This has some merit, but it also leads to possibility of breakage for the
exact same reasons stated above.

Okay, I'll agree that some sort of ChangeLog like that wouldn't be a
horrible thing to have.  But, the question gets into what changes need to
be documented there?  And that's a whole other barrel of questions.
