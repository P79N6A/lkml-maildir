Folks,
There is something weird going on near VGER, which appears
to cause _inbound_ SMTP protocol sessions to hang every now
and then.  (Rather often in fact..)
So far network dump investigations are telling, that something
is corrupting outbound data frames somewhere in the network.
A router next to VGER is suspected.
Also it does look like Linuxes (2.4/2.6 at least) are mostly
immune to the problem, so are also Solaris 2.8 systems, while
Solaris 2.6/2.7 hang.
Hardware vendors have been contacted, and high priority trouble-
tickets have been opened...
