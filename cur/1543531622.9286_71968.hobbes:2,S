And there are also data pages. From 1.0, fs/exec.c:
error = do_mmap(file, N_TXTADDR(ex) + ex.a_text, ex.a_data,
                PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE | PROT_EXEC,
                MAP_FIXED | MAP_PRIVATE, N_TXTOFF(ex) +
                ex.a_text);
do_mmap is also called for text, read-only.
The comments say:
 * Demand-loading implemented 01.12.91 - no need to read anything but
 * the header into memory. The inode of the executable is put into
 * "current->executable", and page faults do the actual loading. Clean.
and later
 * Demand loading changed July 1993 by Eric Youngdale.   Use mmap instead,
 * current->executable is only used by the procfs.
Looks to me like data was demand loaded in early kernels... and we're
completely ignoring stack growth, of course.
