Thanks, I am assuming the ac4 patch for 2.2.7 is what I want.  Do I need
to cat anything into /proc or are the file descriptor limits just set by
ulimit?  I guess what I am trying to get at, is once I patch with ac4, is
their anything I have to do to set the high watermark for file
descriptors.
Thanks for the help,
Brian
