I've noticed that /proc/net/route entries get padded with binary zeros
instead of spaces, which may be why newer versions of gated dump core.
Please someone fix it for 2.2.0 - i know exactly where (in pre8
sources):
net/ipv4/fib_semantics.c - function fib_node_get_info()
change: memset(buffer+len,0,127-len);
to: memset(buffer+len,32,127-len);
It works. Please hurry - 2.2.0 goes out on Monday. Thanks.
