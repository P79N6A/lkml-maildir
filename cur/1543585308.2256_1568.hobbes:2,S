Are you using the right version of the driver disk and
firmware? It should be 4.50.
You best download the latest ServeRAID Support CD image:
ftp://ftp.pc.ibm.com/pub/pccbbs/pc_servers/25p2529.iso
You can upgrade your ServeRAID firmware & BIOS by booting
from this CD, and it contains a driver disk floppy image
that supports installing RedHat 7.0. It worked for me.
Supposedly there's a version 4.70 coming soon that will
suppport kernel 2.4. The current 4.50 driver is unstable
on kernel 2.4.
