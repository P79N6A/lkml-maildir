To add to the complexity of the idea; the kernel could even keep a count
for which handler was getting how many interrupts, and keep the list
sorted, so that the most likely handlers get called first. If there was a
serial board and a video board and a data acquisition board, then
you'd have a list like:
handler count
serial  3000
data    250
video   22
So the next interrupt would go to the serial board first, cause it's
most likely to handle it.
I haven't check the source, but since /proc/interrupts keeps a count
for each interrupt, I assume the counting is already being done. It
just needs to be split among the handlers.
Of course, this now raises the question of should /proc/interrupts be
changed to reflect the breakdown among handlers?
