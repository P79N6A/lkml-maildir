 Hi,
  I'd prefer if you change the name in rtc-m41t80 and add
 the names of the supported chips in the Kconfig entry.

 would be easier to understand if you have some #defines 
 with the sizes you require for the various buffers.

 the proc interface will go away sooner or later, would be better to expose
 the battery status with a sysfs attribute.

 Unless this include is required by other files, please place
 it in drivers/rtc calling it rtc-drivername.h
 Other than the comments above, the driver
 seems fine to me.
