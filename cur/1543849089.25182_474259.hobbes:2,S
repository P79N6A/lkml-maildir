OK, so it isn't due to passing in a short / zero length to commit_write.
It is more likely to be a subtle bug when retrying the write after having
faulted on the first page. Hmm, you wouldn't be deadlocking on i_mutex,
due to faulting in fault_in_pages_readable (that is against the documented
lock ordering, but thank god it looks like the documentation is incorrect
as msync doesn't hold mmap_sem over do_fsync).
I can't see anything yet, but I'll keep looking (and try to reproduce
if I can get TLP working).
