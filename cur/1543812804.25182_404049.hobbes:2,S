No, it hasn't since we got the motherboard. Yes, it is 1.20 instead 
of 1.50. The MSI web is such a crap I couldn't first of all get the 
file at all and once found on a local reseller's page the zip file 
contains no Changelog, so I have no clue what happened between 1.20 
and 1.50 BIOS revision.

It is really something else, 16GB can be seen under 2.6.15, 
2.6.15-rc1 (if I remember right my previous kernel version).
I can reproduce just by booting with "wrong" kernel version.
Any other recommendation? Except flashing and praying?
I haven't touched the BIOS setting either, I worked completely remotely.
