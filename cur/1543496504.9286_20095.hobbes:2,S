I don't know about what M-Systems and IGEL do in general, but after
emailing them about Linux support for their DiskOnChip 2000 they
emailed me an .o file that I linked into my kernel, so I could boot
from the flash disk.
Is it ok to provide an object file and then let the user himself link
this with some GPL system ?  Or is it the same as providing the
statically linked binary ?
