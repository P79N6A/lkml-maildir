Indeed. Quad tulip cards usually have irq pin A of each chip routed
to pins A-D on the connector, so they cannot have the same irq unless
all four irq pins are shared in the parent slot, which is unlikely in
this case.

Here's [completely untested] patch that attempts to validate BIOS irq
assignments. This may break "good" irqs for other devices, but it's
interesting to see if it changes something.

We certainly shouldn't wrt PCI IO and MMIO allocations, but irq routing
appears to be so horribly overcomplexed on x86 that dependence on
BIOS seems almost unavoidable here...
Other architectures don't have such kind of problems, BTW.
