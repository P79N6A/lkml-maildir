Thought about it, but they were so simple, I believed they would better

Not really. Many seem to like a single return and since this made it one 
va_end() to every va_start(), I thought it would be appropriate. But if 
not, then I will only filter this hit out from the 
va_start()->va_end()-testing and get going.
