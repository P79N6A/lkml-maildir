I do agree that order-9 allocations simply is unlikely to work without 
some pre-allocation notion or some serious work at active de-fragmentation 
(and the page cache is likely to be the _least_ of the problems people 
will hit - slab and other kernel allocations are likely to be much much 
harder to handle, since you can't free them in quite as directed a 
manner).
But for smallish-order (eg perhaps 3-4 possibly even more if you are 
careful in other places), the page cache limiter may well be a "good 
enough" solution in practice, especially if other allocations can be 
controlled by strict usage patterns (which is not realistic in a general- 
purpose kind of situation, but might be realistic in embedded).
