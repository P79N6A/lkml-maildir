Rik is right, just because you are seeing long waits on wait_on_page
doesn't make it a vm problem. When a I/O on a page completes, the
page will be unlocked and wait_on_page can grab it -- so I/O stalls
would results in this behaviour.
Could you try this patch:
*.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/axboe/patches/2.4.0-test10-pre6/blk-7.bz2
and see if it makes a difference?
