Probably an impossible task...

No.
  fd = open("/", O_RDONLY);
  chroot("/tmp");
  fchdir(fd);
and you're out of the chroot.

Probably not. Make that: change the directory to chroot'd directory if
the current working directory is outside the chroot. That is, leave
the cwd alone if it is already inside the chroot.
