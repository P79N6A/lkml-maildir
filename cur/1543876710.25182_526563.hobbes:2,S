Hello,
I'm not sure whether a fix is necessary for the following scenario.
The kernel configure target "make menuconfig" requires ncurses.   FWIW, it
could probably be better if the error message would indicate that that
ncurses is necessary for "make menuconfig" to run and that the user could
be prompted to install the package.
Thank you very much.
Best Regards,
Carlo
