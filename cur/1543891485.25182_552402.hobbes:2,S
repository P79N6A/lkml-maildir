All appears to work fine, until I try to boot a kernel with a Reiser4 /
partition.  Then I get endless errors of the sort:
[  206.349450] sd 1:0:0:0: [sdc] Result: hostbyte=DID_BAD_TARGET
driverbyte=DRIVER_OK,SUGGEST_OK
(See attached dmesg for more, I only sent the first 1,000 lines, it goes
on until a hard reboot.)
The same partition and the same kernel work great as long as that
partition isn't the current system root.  The same kernel and the same
hard drive works fine as long as the partition is formatted ReiserFS.
