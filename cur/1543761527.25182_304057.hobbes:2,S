It's a rather unorthodox fix, but not illogical.  I guess it depends upon
how much sysctl infrastructure it adds.  Probably quite a lot.
Another approach would be to just say the ratio now has a range 0 .. 
999,999 and then, if it happens to be less than 100, treat that as a
percentage for back-compatibility reasons.  Although that's a bit kludgy
and perhaps a completely new /proc entry would be better.
