Simple: we MUST NOT muck around with the page counts of random pages.
And if the pages aren't marked Reserved, the page counts _would_ get
corrupted by the VM page handling.
Ergo: you can only mmap Reserved pages (or you have to create a nice
mapping and allocate the pages properly, which in the case of /dev/mem is
obviously not a possibility)
