It occurs to me that we actually do have the "extended symlink" concept in
UNIX already: the existing "#!" escape for executables is really exactly
that. It's just a structured symlink, except the extension is not a
capability, but rather it's the script to be fed to the executable.
With a simple extended binfmt_misc.c or binfmt_script.c, we could do a
capability escape (that only removes capabilities, but allows for suid
shells) fairly easily if people really want it. And it would work on any
almost-UNIXy filesystem, including NFS etc.
But I like Al's idea of mount binds even more, although it requires maybe
a bit more administration.
