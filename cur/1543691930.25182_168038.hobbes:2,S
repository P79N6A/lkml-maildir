Sorry John about the mis-information. Of course case is not significant,
otherwise we would simply not receive these mails. I should have said
"common usage" and not "protocols", since I really thought the former
eventhough I wrote the later.

I don't know. It's only an empirical choice based on observations. Many of us
are more concerned by hundreds of mails a day than risking to get a rare
false-positive. But I agree, I should have been clearer.
I have nearly the same .procmailrc as the one Joern Engel proposed :
  :0 D
  * ^FORM:
  spam/swen
And I too agree that I have 0% false positive so far. But just like any filter,
use at your own risk...
