Hi,
sometimes one of my servers doesn't boot correctly. Lilo reads the
kernel-image, but doesn't decompress it. So the system won't
continue booting.
Looks like:
Loading linux...................
(at this point the machine freezes)
To be clear, most times it boots perfectly, but in 2 of 10 times it
hangs.
I tried different versions of Lilo (21.4.4-13 and 21.7-5) without success.
The system is running Redhat 7.1 with the SGI XFS patches applied and
the kernel is compressed with bzip.
[root@webtrends /root]# uname -a
Linux webtrends 2.4.2-SGI_XFS_1.0 #8 SMP Die Mai 22 10:27:24
CEST 2001 i686 unknown
The Hardware is: Tyan Thunder LE 2510UANG, 2*PIII-933, 1GB of Ram,
Mylex AccelRAID 352 configured for RAID 5
Someone can give me a hint?
Regards,
Patric
