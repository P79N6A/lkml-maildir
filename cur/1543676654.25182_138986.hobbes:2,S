	For the last time, there is no socket queue. You wouldn't want there to be
one.
	Consider a UDP application that is sending packets to two destinations, one
over a 56Kbps serial link running PPP and one over gigabit Ethernet. If
there were a socket send queue, the packets going over the 56Kbps serial
link would block the packets going over the gigabit Ethernet.

	No, it is legal, you are just misusing it. If you don't want your socket
operations to ever block, use non-blocking socket operations. If you use
UDP, or another connectionless protocol, you should understand that *you*
are responsible for transmit pacing.

	I guess I'm not getting through. The fact is, you don't have the guarantee
that you think you have. I'm giving you examples to show you why you don't
have that guarantee. You argue that the examples don't apply to your
specific case. I'm not saying they do. I'm saying that because there are
unavoidable cases where what you're trying to do won't work, then what
you're trying to do is not guaranteed to work in all cases and you shouldn't
try to do it.
	The kernel does not remember that you got a write hit on 'select' and use
it to somehow ensure that your next 'write' doesn't block. A 'write' hit
from 'select' is just a hint and not an absolute guarantee that whatever
'write' operation you happen to choose to do won't block.
