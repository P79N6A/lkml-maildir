It crashes because the stack is misaligned.  x86-64 requires that the
stack is always aligned to a 16-byte boundary, but your stack pointer
isn't.
The RAID-6 code for x86-64 specifically assumes proper stack
alignment, so a misaligned stack is fatal.
I don't know what would cause the stack to be misaligned, however.
