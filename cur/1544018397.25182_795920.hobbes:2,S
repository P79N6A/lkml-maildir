First goal would be to get people interested.  Why would Joe
Kernelhacker care about this, what problem would it solve for him?  Next
goal is to prove to akpm that the solved problems are worth the
maintenance burden this code brings.
It would be nice to have diffstat added to each patch to give people
a quick overview.  More importantly, the number of #ifdef's in the
patches may raise a red flag.  You should try to remove them from common
code and have a single one in the headers:
#ifdef CONFIG_NEW_FEATURE
void handle_this(int foo, long bar);
#else
static inline void handle_this(int foo, long bar)
{
}
#endif
Not sure what else to say.  I'm still wondering whether it will solve a
problem for me.
