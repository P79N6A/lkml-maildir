I thinking these comments are awfully confusing (bitcount_1 == 0
?!?!?) and maybe redundant.
It would be much more useful to explain the logic behind why
(bitcount_1 == 0) and remove the /* Bit Count = X */ comments

Wouldn't only (0x1) be better?

!?!??!?!
All in all, except for what Andrew has pointed out, it looks good,
maybe a little bit overengineered...
