Subject: PATCH: fix disassociate_ctty vs. fork race
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

hi,
Race is as follows. Process A forks process B, both being part of the same 
session. Then, A calls disassociate_ctty while B forks C:
A				B
----				----
				fork()
				  copy_signal()
dissasociate_ctty()		....
				  attach_pid(p, PIDTYPE_SID, p->signal->session);
Now, C can have current->signal->tty pointing to a freed tty structure, as 
it hasn't yet been added to the session group (to have its controlling tty 
cleared on the diassociate_ctty() call). 
 
This has shown up as an oops but could be even more serious. I haven't 
tried to create a test case, but a customer has verified that the patch 
below resolves the issue, which was occuring quite frequently. I'll try 
and post the test case if i can.
The patch simply checks for a NULL tty *after* it has been attached to the 
proper session group and clears it as necessary. Alternatively, we could 
simply do the tty assignment after the the process is added to the proper 
session group.
thanks,
-Jason
