I am Mr. George Philips, the Director of Operations Asset forfeiture unit. I request your co-operation in this confidential transaction of cash money amounting to the sum of Thirty-two Million Dollars. $32,000.000.00.
I and my colleague secured this fund during the course of our duty in the case of Six Hundred-Million Dollars Diamond DiepSloot Mining Rackets. Our duty covers many financial activities. Due to our sensitive position and civil code of conduct, which does not allow us to own or operate foreign bank accounts and many other things, we seek your cooperation in this deal to externalize this fund.
We will provide you with the necessary logistics for this project if you are interested in this deal, please reply to my personal mailbox: inf0gep@hotmail.com, I will give you all the documentations including details for a hitch free transaction. I want to assure/guarantee you that this deal has been structured for a hitch free and successful transaction without any risk. The fund is untraceable by any persons or Government. This 
transaction will be structured with legal documentation to cover the fund; met with all international regulations regarding fund transfer.
Finally, I will give you a quarter of the total sum as your commission for your corporation. While I waits for your reply along with your telephone 
number.
Yours sincerely.
George Philips
