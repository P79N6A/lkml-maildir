OK, again, slowly this time:
You allocate 8Mb for stack for each process on your system (here, a very
underworked workstation, 88 processes right now). That means some 800Mb of
space that is reserved. Add the potential size of the processes data areas
themselves, say some other 800Mb, and this machine can't handle the load: I
has 128Mb RAM + 128Mb swap. With your scheme it won't even be able to
finish booting before going OOM. Forget about minor jobs such as compiling
a kernel or (horror of horrors) egcs + running its testsuite. Which I do
regularly.
Sure, no process can go OOM. The system goes down in flames way before.
