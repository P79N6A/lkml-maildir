Probably an mmap-ed sound problem or some ioctl is not implemented.
Q3A is on my YMF list, behind power management. Please feel free
to investigate it yourself and send any patches.
Another thing that you can do is to try to use ALSA. I think
that ALSA driver is superior for most cases because
my ymfpci code is based on Jaroslav's ALSA code and
will be replaced by ALSA eventually.
