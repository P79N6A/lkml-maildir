Hi all,
Quilt 0.44 has been released today. It fixes a serious bug in the push
command which could lead to data loss. Thanks to Peter Williams for
reporting. This bug was introduced in release 0.43, so I invite all
users of that release to upgrade to 0.44 quickly.
Quilt 0.44 can be downloaded from here:

Thanks,
