The only problem I can see with this is that on x86_64 and other
platforms that reimplement the routine as an inline function, I think
we'll be left with a small hunk of dead code in the form of the
out-of-line version in lib/ that never gets referenced.
Is this something people care about?  If so, I could turn the config
setting in my last patch on its head, and use it to indicate that the
routine should *not* be built for a particular arch.  This would make
lib/Makefile slightly uglier, but would avoid cluttering every other
arch's lib/Makefile and Kconfig file.
