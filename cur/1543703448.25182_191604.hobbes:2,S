My smartctl wants "-s off" rather than "-d", but other than that,
you're correct, that sequence of commands does ause the same error to
appear in the logs.  But why/how would SMART be disabled on the drive?
I've been running smartd on the drive for weeks with no errors of this
sort, and I fail to see how SMART would suddenly be disabled on the
drive with no action on my part, so it seems more likely that some
other condition caused the error.
Thanks,
