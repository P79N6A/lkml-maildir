If this is merged, suse is stuck with technically inferior solution
forever. This may please parts of suse, but not our users.
If this is not merged, suse will [have to] work with selinux people to
come up with friendlier userland tools/selinux improvements. (We
already had discussions with vojtech about a way to add path-based
aspects to selinux, and selinux people already offered to add 'new
file label is function of directory label and new name' support, which
addresses lots of reasons for AA).
Actually, there's a middle way. Merging only 'pass vfsmounts down'
parts will make AA self contained enough that suse will not go crazy
while trying to maintain it, but will have good enough incentive to
work with selinux people on something better.
