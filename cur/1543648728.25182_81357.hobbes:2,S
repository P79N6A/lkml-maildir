sounds not good to me, you would miss a wakeup and you would delay the
schedule of 1/HZ in the worst (close to the common) case.
My idea of encoding the cpuid in the top 8bit of each 64bit word that
can be read atomically (of course this trivially applies in the now
per-cpu two sequence numbers that defines the critical section for each
cpu) sounds a way superior solution to me to read coherent per-cpu data
enterely locklessy and without preemption locks.
