I think the exponential increase isn't the problem. The old code did 
approximate something like this rather crudely with the result that there 
was a big gap between level 0 and -1.
Something like this:
echo 'for (i=-20;i<=20;i++) print i, " : ", 1024*e(l(2)*(-i/20*3)), "\n";' | bc -l
would produce a range similiar to the old code. Replacing the factor 3 
with 4 would be IMO a more reasonable increase and had the advantage for 
the user that it's easier to understand that every 5 levels the time a 
process gets is doubled.
bye, Roman
