I didn't actually try them; I jumped right from 12 to 18, and when that
and 19 died, I went back to 12. 
But a quick look suggests that the entire patch I'd applied to 12 and got
a hang with was in 13, including the pm.c change.
I also haven't tried anything after 24; is it likely to have been fixed?
