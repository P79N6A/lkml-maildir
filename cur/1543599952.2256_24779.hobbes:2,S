Just out of curiosity, can you drop that to 100Mhz FSB and a multiplier 
of 8? I don't know about the manual clocking support on EpoX boards, but 
if you can, it might be good to give it a shot. Most likely it has 
nothing to do with clock speed whatsoever, but I'm really beginning to 
wonder. I don't think I've seen a single reported case under 900-1000Mhz, 
and thunderbirds were made below 900Mhz.
(reason I chose 800MHz is my non-tbird Athlon is 800 and is rock solid)
