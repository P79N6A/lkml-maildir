I think the idea is flawed.
You're building a filesystem in a filesystem to overcome your
"non-optimal" original file system.  Either replace your original fs
or create your tar file.
Stacker (& later a MS deviate) under that other OS did something like
that and compressed the volume as well.  I think the product was
pretty successful (MS stole the code) but I don't know how good the
"technology" is (you still need information to locate your "file",
access it and decompress it - what happens when you extend a "file"
etc).
As a side note (aprox current US prices):
	9.1 GB UW-SCSI, 7200 rpm harddrive: ~$290
	18 GB UW-SCSI, 7200 rpm harddrive: ~$600
I paid ~$600 for a 9.1 GB about a year ago (and I still have 2 GB
free).  E.g. the pace of technology is probably against your idea.
