Alan,
I'll give the CMOS a check to see if it's configured wrong.  What's puzzling
here is that Netware seems to view it one way and Linux another.  The
missing 70 cylinders don't bother me as much as cross-platform compatibility
issues with different OS's seeing drives differently.  Just for fun, I
changed the code to ignore the bogus geometry and the netware volumes that
were in the partition that spanned past 780 (to 850) mounted fine, with
Linux able to address sectors beyond cylinder 780.  However, what gets
reported to the utility (fdisk, nwdisk) is smaller than the actual drive
(780) which means folks will be forced to allocate netware partitions that
are smaller than the device allows.  I will study this problem in more
depth, and let you know what I find.  I'll also let dwquest know what I see
also.
Your friend,
Jeff
P.S.  Totally Kick-Ass IPO -- RedHat is **SMOKING** on Wall Street right
now..
