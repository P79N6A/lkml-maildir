take this with a grain of salt, I'm not saying the particular versions I'm 
listing would require this
if your new guest kernel wants to use some new feature (SKAS3, time 
virtualization, etc) but the older host kernel didn't support some system call 
nessasary to implement it, you may need to upgrade the host kernel to one that 
provides the new features.
