I can't agree.  If you deconfigure sysfs, it still works.
Since it's independent like that, there's no way it's "tied".

Go look again.  "may" implies (i) can , and (ii) should.  So if there's a
hardware quirk registered, (i) always fails.  And in the not-uncommon case
where the device misbehavior isn't known to the kernel, userspace has the
option of making (ii) kick in (the workaround mentioned above).  This is a
generic approach, it works on all wakeup-capable devices.
So "may" is correct, and "can" is insufficient.

See above, and the definition of may_wakeup().

See above.  Quirks directly recognized by the kernel clear can_wakeup.
Ones that are reported via userspace clear should_wakeup.  Either suffices
to ensure that the may_wakeup() predicate fails.
