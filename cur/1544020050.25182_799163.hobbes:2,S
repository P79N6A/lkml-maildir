I misunderstood preemptible RCU. I assumed it was a new API but its not. So
I don't think preemptible RCU is an option since it would force a dependency
on CONFIG_PREEMPT_RCU.
I'm going to break up this patch in two. One patch for converting to rcu.
A second patch which will support checking all tasks. To support checking
all tasks I reverted back to a design similar to Frédéric original proposal.
I'll send the patches out right after this email.
[PATCH 1/2] softlockup: convert read_lock in hung_task to rcu_read_lock
[PATCH 2/2] softlockup: check all tasks in hung_task

Mandeep
