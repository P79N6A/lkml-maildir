Does your screen only have 63 columns?

Try submitting a bug report that reads "there's this and this problem
in 2.4.22."  One of the first questions you are bound to be asked is
"could you clarify the version you're seeing the problem with?"
> I hope you just use release kernels, -pres are only for Mandrake people ;)
Does Mandrake also ship "stable" distributions w/ kernels compiled using
gcc 3.3-whatever or is that idiocy suse-specific?

So far I said nothing about the problem itself; all the time I'm merely
trying to point out that it's dreadfully unreasonable to pretend that
there's a gcc 3.3.1.

Right.
