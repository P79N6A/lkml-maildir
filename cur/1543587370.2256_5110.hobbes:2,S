i have two network connections.
one is to my company with the lan useing the 192.168.0.0 subnet,
and the other is to a client using the same subnet.
i wanted to know if it was possible to setup some kind of nating on my laptop 
in such a way, that will translate the client's entire 192.168.0.0 subnet 
into a 10.168.0.0 subnet on by laptop.
i printed the man pages for ipchains, but i'm not sure how and where
to start.
if anyone can help, that would be appreciated.
i'm runing SuSE 7.1 2.4.0-4GB kernel on my ibm 600E latop.
