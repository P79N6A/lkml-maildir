If you look at the figures from the various benchmarking sites that doesnt
sound unexpected. If you can recode your applications (eg if its a complex
analysis problem) to use SSE2 and the like you may well get big speed ups

The impact of that depends entirely on your application

Do the boot messages ay anothing about this ?
