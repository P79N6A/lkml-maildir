It means that you are saying that kernel should be bigger and bigger.
Please, see the graphics APIs. Why we have X servers in user space (and
only some supporting code is in the kernel) then? It's because if we 
would move everything into kernel it will be even more bloated. The kernel 
should do really the basic things like direct hardware access, DMA 
transfer etc.

The grounds of ALSA APIs are not complicated. The complicated are the 
extra features (like stream linking) which can be included conditionaly. 
Note that during API development, mostly users requesting extra features 
were speak loudly, others were only watching.
We know that the reduction requests have points for embedded systems etc.
And we will definitely try to sort "real-core" and "extra" things.
Also, note that if OSS used a library to access to sound devices, we won't 
ever have such problems with the OSS API redirection to another API.
I already created a prototype of OSS API redirector (part of alsa-oss 
package), see:
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/alsa/alsa-oss/oss-redir/README?rev=1.1&view=markup
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/alsa/alsa-oss/oss-redir/oss-redir.h?rev=1.6&view=markup
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/alsa/alsa-oss/oss-redir/oss-redir.c?rev=1.9&view=markup
But it's a question, if OSS application developers take this proposal.
