Indeed, that's the right one for functions like semop that are specified in
1003.1-2001 explicitly to wake up when a signal was caught.  I read the
SA_RESTART wording as not intending to apply to functions that say that
explicitly.
> There are lots of system calls that simply are not restartable. 
POSIX permits partial results for cases like read and write.  Those aside,
and leaving aside calls in uninterruptible sleeps (in which stops take
place only after the sleep wakes), POSIX would seem to require that they be
restarted when there is a job control stop and continue.

ERESTARTSYS and ERESTARTNOHAND only differ when a handler is run,
which is not the case I am talking about.

POSIX clearly specifies that stopping and continuing "shall not affect the
behavior of any function" (when SIGCONT is SIG_DFL or SIG_IGN, or is blocked).
