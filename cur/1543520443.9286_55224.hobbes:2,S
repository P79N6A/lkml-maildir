No, I am using the very latest that Frank posted and to which Linus said
it is fine. Ok, I admit my tests were very agressive and not systematic -
I will now try to reproduce it more systematically (and with various
blocksizes) and let you know the results. Fortunately thekernel is still
on 2.3.35-pre3 so I might be able to make the testcase ready before
Linus makes the next version (assuming he is asleep now).
Regards,
Tigran.
