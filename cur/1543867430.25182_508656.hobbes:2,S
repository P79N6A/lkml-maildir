If X is getting confused fix X. Those BARs are *undefined* in legacy
mode. The value in them is undefined, the results that end up there if
you do write to them are undefined too. If X believes those BAR values
blindly it'll do the wrong thing in some freaky cases.
Which specific versions of X are problematic ?
As to the implementation:
	start and end as passed are the real I/O values so you don't need
to mask them that I can see.
I've no fundamental problem with writing the BAR values back to avoid
confusing some apparently broken X, but I'd like to know what X, what
circumstances and that X is also getting fixed.
