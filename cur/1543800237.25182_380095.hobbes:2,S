	Using choice with two tristate config options seems to provide the
better look and feel, while keeping the desired effect. The only
drawback is that Kconfig doesn't accept default values for the "config"
inside a choice. It would be nice if both choice and the ALSA/OSS
options be marked as "m" by default.
	Anyway, IMHO, this is better and clearer than the previous patches.
Cheers, 
Mauro.
V4L/DVB: change alsa/oss option to choice
Using tristate choice Kconfig option seems to produce a better result.
