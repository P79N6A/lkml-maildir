i'd not call this 'barely' or 'noise'! Look:

the main metric we are interested in is the overhead for people who just 
want to run the non-patched native kernel that has CONFIG_PARAVIRT 
enabled (99%+ of the users at the moment), so the delta is:
 null:              +12.0%
 null IO:            +7.5%
 stat:        within noise
 open/close:  within noise
 TCP:                ~5.0%
 signal install:      2.0%
 signal handle:       4.7%
 fork:                2.7%
 exec:                3.6%
 shell:               3.6%
this is not 'barely measurable' but 'BLOODY LARGE' overhead. Really. I 
mean for something as complex as exec we still are 'a couple of percent' 
slower? Linux has literally _dozens_ of important but inactive features 
in every critical fastpath and in every critical system call, and if 
each took 'just a few percent', we'd be a few _times_ slower as an end 
result, for features that are not even used! The answer to any such 
overhead is: "get your act together and stop burdening those who dont 
want to use that feature" ... This is a basic engineering requirement.

i guess this pretty much makes the case for patching ...
