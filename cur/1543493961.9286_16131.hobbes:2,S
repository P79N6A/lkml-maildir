I have setup a DNS server in Hong Kong running Linux Kernel 2.2.6 with
ipchains firewall support enabled.  The DNS has been running for quite a
while and it's working fine until I decided to setup a firewall using
ipchains.  I have setup the firewall for DNS as follows.
#!/bin/sh
PORTS="1024:65535"
LOCALIP="xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx"
LOCALNET="xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/xx"
ANYNET="0.0.0.0/0"
LOOP="127.0.0.1"
EXEC="/sbin/ipchains"
#Flush all rules (allow all)
$EXEC -F
# Allow DNS connection from anywhere
$EXEC -A input -p TCP -s $ANYNET 53             -d $LOCALIP 53
-j ACCEPT
$EXEC -A input -p UDP -s $ANYNET 53             -d $LOCALIP 53
-j ACCEPT
$EXEC -A input -p TCP -s $ANYNET 53             -d $LOCALIP $PORTS
-j ACCEPT
$EXEC -A input -p UDP -s $ANYNET 53             -d $LOCALIP $PORTS
-j ACCEPT
As far as I know there's nothing wroug with these settings.   When I up
the firewall up everything seems to working fine locally and other
networks in Hong Kong but when I use a machine in the US, I can't query
the server in Hong Kong using nslookup while the firewall is up.   When
I disable the firewall then everything works fine.
What could be causing this problem?  Any ideas or solusions?
Your help is highly appreciated.  Many thanks.
Kent.
