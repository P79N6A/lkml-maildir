userspace governors need to know the available frequencies to scale to, 
which they obtain from sysfs. In addition, we maintain an index as to
which of those is currently chosen.  However, programs should not rely
on this to be a "how fast is my CPU" status, as it's totally meaningless.
It's there purely for humans to see "Yes, X < Y, so I'm going at the
lower of the frequencies my CPU can do", not for programs to calculate
delays loops and such.
