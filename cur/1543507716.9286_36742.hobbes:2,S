Hey guys!
You just made my day...! :) It darn whell works!@ :))
(stuff is on high speed right now...with compression and all...(kernel
2.2.12 at the moment) (btw kernel patch 2.2.10 is buggy :) (heh i mean,
there is an error in the patch file somewhere...didnt write it
down...leeched the 2.2.12 completely).
Just in time also...was just going to setup a standalone linux gw here
having my 3rd new PC coming in and all....
Thanks David!
Greets,
Bas Oude Nijeweme
