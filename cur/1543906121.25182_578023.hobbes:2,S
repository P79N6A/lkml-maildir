It looks to me like you were saying you would remove this extension to the
OProfile file system (/dev/oprofile/implementation).
However, it looks like it has made it into the mainline kernel code.  As David
pointed out, the value isn't initialized for architectures other than i386.  As
a result you get a kernel crash (at least on PPC) with the following commands.
opcontrol --init
cat /dev/oprofile/implementation
Kevin Corry is working on a patch but until that makes it out people may want
to be a little careful with this...
