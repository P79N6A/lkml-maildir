Various people have reported this. Its indicating a deadlock occured somewhere
in the mm/fs layers. Its not good news
Apply the patch Stephen Tweedie posted for the wchan channel then you can
see where they all hang. Also if Linus doesnt reply to this one I'll forward
you his request to another person with the same type of report that explains
what to do to find where each process is jammed. That assumes you can
reproduce it easily. If you can let me know.
