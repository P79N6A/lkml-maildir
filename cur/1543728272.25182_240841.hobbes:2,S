Note that this is something else going on. The "obvious one-liner" can be 
an issue only with certain special XFS stuff or knfsd, neither of which 
you have.

As Andrew already requested, the only way for us to figure out what is 
wrong is to get output from you on where the memory has gone. Notably, the 
output of "/proc/meminfo" and "/proc/slabinfo". "ps axm" helps too.
If it is slow, the above will still work. Just save them away and reboot.
