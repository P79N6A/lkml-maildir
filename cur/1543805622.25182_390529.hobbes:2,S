This is essentially the same as arm_ffs():
grundler_ffs:
        mov     r3, r0, asl #16
        mov     r3, r3, lsr #16
        cmp     r3, #0
        moveq   r0, r0, lsr #16
        mov     r3, #31
        movne   r3, #15
        tst     r0, #255
        moveq   r0, r0, lsr #8
        subne   r3, r3, #8
        tst     r0, #15
        moveq   r0, r0, lsr #4
        subne   r3, r3, #4
        tst     r0, #3
        moveq   r0, r0, lsr #2
        subne   r3, r3, #2
        tst     r0, #1
        subne   r3, r3, #1
        mov     r0, r3
        mov     pc, lr
only that the shifts, immediate values and the sense of some of the
conditional instructions have changed.  Therefore, the parisc rough
equivalent looks like it would be suitable for ARM as well.

Me too - already solved this problem once.  However, I'd rather not
needlessly take a step backwards in the name of generic bitops.
