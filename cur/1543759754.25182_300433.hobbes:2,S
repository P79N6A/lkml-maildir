> I used msleep(10) here under the presumption that the 
> schedule_timeout(1) was written assuming that HZ=100 (as it 
> used to be), which is equivalent to 10 milliseconds. If the 
> desire is actually for 1 ms or the minimal sleep interval, 
> then the patch can be changed appropriately. A similar 
> assumption as to the constant delay value was made in the 
> other replacement, which can also be appropriately adjusted.
> 
> Change the delay logic in pollcomplete() to use msleep() and 
> time_before(). Instead of assuming schedule_timeout() will 
> sleep exactly as requested, use msleep(10) to guarantee 
> minimally 10 millisecond increments and
> time_before() to guarantee stopping the loop as close to 20 
> seconds as possible.
> Also changes another occurrence of schedule_timeout() to msleep().
> TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE is used in this case, but signals are not handled.
