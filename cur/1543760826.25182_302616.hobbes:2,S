Subject: [TTY] overrun notify issue during 5 minutes after booting

I noticed that TTY is not able to notify overrun issue
in "n_tty_receive_overrun". Actually it's because of
"time_before" macro which tests "tty->overrun_time" 
(equals to 0) against "jiffies - HZ" (something very
big
after booting).
I guess a simple way to solve it, is to initialize
"tty->overrun_time" to "jiffies". But it won't work if
an overrun appear after a very long while....
Thanks
