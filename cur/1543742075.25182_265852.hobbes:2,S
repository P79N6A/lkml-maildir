 I think when udev creates the ptys nodes dynamically it corrupts the
Legacy ones already create. With CONFIG_LEGACY_PTYS turned off there
never created and udev is free to do what it wants. It could be the
complete reverse though.
By the way th settings in permissions.d are 660 for most things
including ptys. I'm running slackware.
