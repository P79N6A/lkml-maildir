The bug is probably latent there, but I don't think it can affect anything
in the kernel because nothing in the kernel should change NX status
as far as I know.
Where did you see it? 
Anyways I would prefer to only clear the PMD NX when NX status actually 
changes on the PTE.Can you do that change? 
Anyways; it's really not very important.
