Welcome to NFS. You basically need file locking (lockf/posix - flock is
not portably applicable to NFS) and you may need to turn off attribute
caching to make O_APPEND work portably.
Its a pain, but NFS has no other way to infer your transaction
constraints. You need to lock for read and for write on all clients, a
client reading without locking may get stale data.
Personally I use my own little daemons to manage transactional data,
ones that understand my transaction rules
