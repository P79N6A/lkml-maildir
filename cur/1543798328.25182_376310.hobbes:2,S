Ah, drat. 
I'm just going to dump the c3tsc clocksource for now. If C3 mode is
available, the ACPI PM timer is available (since it is used for C3
timing), so we'll just fall back to ACPI PM if we see the cpu entering
C3 mode.
I'm working to respin a new release tonight, hopefully that will make it
upstream to -rt soon and that should take care of it. Later I can look
at reworking the c3tsc clocksource, but for now things need to just
work.
Thanks again for the testing and feedback, I really appreciate your
help!
