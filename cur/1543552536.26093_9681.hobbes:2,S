Also try increasing the device queue length
by "ifconfig eth0 txqueuelen 1024". In
doing some testing, we found that if you
are really bursty in sending data, the
device queue will silently drop packets
(free them) and I didnt find any stats
which show the dropped packets.
Increasing the queue length to 1024 got
rid of the problem for us.
