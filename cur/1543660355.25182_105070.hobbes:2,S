Subject: [PATCH]  Include <asm/page.h> in fs/seq_file.c, as it uses PAGE_SIZE
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Otherwise it won't compile.  I guesss this used to work because
<asm/page.h> was included somewhere to get the BUG macros, but now with
the advent of <asm/bug.h> that's changed.
