Allocation faliures with highmem seems cured (at least under heavy
emulation, didn't tested real hardware yet).  Robert, could you give it
a spin and see if you can still reproduce the faliures now?

	Dropped, it generated a false positive on s390 that implements
	slightly different semantics for pte_dirty (using per-page

	Allocation faliures with highmem should be cured. Swap seems
	smooth and Andrew's workload also seems ok. Still untested
	on real highmem at the moment and I'd love feedback on it.
	I will be able to test very soon on real highmem too thanks
	to osdlab.org resources.
