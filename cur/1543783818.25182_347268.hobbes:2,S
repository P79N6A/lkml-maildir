This discussion comes up every time ;) HZ/4 rounds incorrectly
(depends on your perspective, I guess) with HZ=250.

I agree, generally it's ok, as timeouts aren't meant to be precise. I,
personally, am converting code over to msecs_to_jiffies() as I come to
it, just so that the conversions are consistent (a number in the tree
were not, not that yours are) and basically self-commented. And, like
I mentioned, they are automatically rounded correctly with "strange"
values of HZ.
The changes I mentioned in your patchset are generally not critical,
but just comments and my own preferences.
Thanks,
Nish
