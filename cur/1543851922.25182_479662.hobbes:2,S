This has all the symptoms to an open EACCES NFSv4 bug in 2.6.18/19.
This is fixed in:
http://www.citi.umich.edu/projects/nfsv4/linux/kernel-patches/2.6.19-rc3-2/linux-2.6.19-rc3-CITI_NFS4_ALL-2.diff
(see 
http://www.citi.umich.edu/projects/nfsv4/linux/
).
With this patch, I can run just great with NFSv4 home dir (etc)
mounts; without, I get the symptom of many 0-byte temporary/lock files
being created and often the inability to create files (!). Be sure to
allow callback delegation connections in through your firewall for the
extra performance ;-) .
Maybe it's too late for these fixes 2.6.19, but they should certainly
make 2.6.19.1 IMHO.
