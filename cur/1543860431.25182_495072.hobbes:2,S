Btw, since this doesn't actually change any code for anybody but ARM, just 
adds a parameter that is obviously unused by everybody else, and if it 
actually fixes a real bug for ARM, I'll obviously happily take it even 
before 2.6.20. So go ahead put it in your ARM tree, and we'll get some 
testing through that. And just ask me to pull at some point.
I wonder why nobody else seems to have a "flush_anon_page()"? This would 
seem to be a potential issue for architectures like sparc too.. Although 
maybe sparc can do a flush by physical index with "flush_dcache_page()".
