True - at this time. But what if this extension mechanism turns out to
be useful and we end up with more optional structures? I was hoping that
this might be the case and thus tried to make it easy to add more
structures.

Unfortunately recursion in macros is not possible. One needs duplicated
macro definitions, one for each additional structure. But perhaps my
preprocessor code fu is lacking today and there is a simpler
solution :-/
Anyway, below is example code with three structures which initializes a
size array indexed by a bit mask. I find it truly ugly and hard to
understand - and I wrote it. gcc -S shows that the size arrays contain
the expected values.
Please let me know what approach is preferred and I'll revise the patch
accordingly:
     1. array with four hard-coded values
     2. init code (where?)
     3. macro initialization of array
     4. simpler initialization solution
