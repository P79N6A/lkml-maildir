It's actually pretty trivial to do if it's a toy filesystem and all the
relevant inodes are in-memory already.  The hard-to-solve part is getting
around the (apparent) need to walk across essentially the entire tree
structure making sure that you aren't creating a loop.  This can get
rather performance piggy - even /home on my laptop has some 400K
inodes on it, and a 'find /home -type d' takes 28 seconds.  That's a *long*
time to lock and freeze a filesystem.
Where it gets *really* messy is that it isn't just mkdir that's the problem -
once you let there be more than one path from the fs root to a given directory,
it gets *really* hard to make sure that any given 'mv' command isn't going to
to screw things up (is 'mv a/b/c/d ../../w/z/b' safe? How do you know, without
examining a *lot* of stuff under a/ and ../../w/?
