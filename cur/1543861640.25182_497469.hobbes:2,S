It shouldn't have mattered in your case, but base_address is limited
to 32bits.  There is a 32 bits reserved zone after it so hope is not
to be lost, but in any case the current code can't handle over-4G base
addresses at that point.
Does the bios or your '965 give a correct acpi mmconfig entry?
  OG.
