Need some helping writing a 2.6 ISA PnP kernel module. Can't find any
docs. I'm writing a probe function, but cannot understand how to get
vendor/function IDs off my card, and specify them in the correct format
in my code. Been using 3c509 driver as reference. A blank PnP module
template with lots of comments would be a blessing :-)
I'm not subscribed to the list, so please CC: my mail address. 
Thanks,
