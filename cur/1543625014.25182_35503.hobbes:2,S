	O_DIRECT isn't the right thing for large streaming.  You want
readahead and dropbehind.  O_DIRECT takes substantial penalties for its
lack of copy/cacheing.  This works fine in certain circumstances
(applications that keep their own caching), but for something like a
video or mp3, you'll win with working dropbehind easily.
