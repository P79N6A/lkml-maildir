Hi,
I have a quick question about kernel threads.
Assume that you have a kernel thread A that spawns another kernel
thread B through the kernel_thread interface.  Kernel thread A then
goes to sleep and thread B is mostly running.  If the kernel thread
B performs a system call that makes it block, ie due to a file read
the forces the system to retrieve it from disk or makes the system
page fault, is it possible to have thread A waken up and be informed
of this.  How could this be done, if at all possible.
Thanks
Dima
