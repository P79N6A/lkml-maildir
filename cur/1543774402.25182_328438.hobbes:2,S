No... the task of the Linux community is to make a better kernel.
You will have to do the work to convince it that the changes give a better
kernel if included. That means the work to find out what they object to,
solve the problem (if it can be solved), and try again.

Good for you. Nobody else has shown any interest in that.

Right. And what is said here is to /use/ said layer (VFS) or see how it can
be changed to cater for your needs.

Gnome and KDE are userspace utilities, designed to run on several operating
systems that do not have such filesystem plugins at all, plus for the
foreseable future the mayority of Linux (file)systems won't have them
either; so they probably won't ever use it for portability's sake. CIFS is
a second class citizen AFAIU, as it exists for compatibility with legacy
systems only. So none of the above is in any way compelling.
