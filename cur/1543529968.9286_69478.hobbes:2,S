Hi,
while inserting a comment about MSP 3400 support, I found that
        make xconfig does not support "comment" unless it's used
        together with mainmenu_option or menu_option.
You can see this at some networking options' places.
make menuconfig is fine. 
This applies to 2.2.15pre14, did not check any other version.
