Actually, is the problem perhaps this:
Let's assume we have columns numbered from 0 to 79 i.e.
00000000001111111111222222222233333333334444444444555555555566666666667777777777

Perhaps your display is like this:
00000000001111111111000000000011111111110000000000111111111100000000001111111111

Around the areas marked with ** there can be a lot of noise.
??
If this is the case I know the cause.
