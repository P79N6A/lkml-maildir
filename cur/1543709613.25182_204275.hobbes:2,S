Hi !
We have a bcm 4400 based NIC which has transmit timeouts with the b44 module. It 
works fine with broadcom's bcm4400 module and a 2.4.x module.
These bug entries,
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=664
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=257
seem to say that they are no problems left, but this card is still not working 
with my 2.6 kernel.
So is someone still working on the bugs ?
Why not integrating the bcm4400 module (GPLed) and droping this buggy b44 module ?
Regards,
