Last time we dicsussed this you pointed out that reserving more lowmem from
highmem-capable allocations may actually *help* things.  (Tries to remember
why) By reducing inode/dentry eviction rates?  I asked Martin Bligh if he
could test that on a big NUMA box but iirc the results were inconclusive.
Maybe it just won't make much difference.  Hard to say.

That reminds me.  Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt ;)
I'll cook something up for that.
