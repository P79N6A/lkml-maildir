My "visions" go elsewhere:
The users who still need partition tables shall get theirs in a sane way 
-- maybe as David Miller proposed, or just simple Sun-styled partition 
tables (even though I don't think they're _much_ saner than PC partition 
tables).
And the second thing is about your point one. We have two big raid arrays 
divided into three racks. Here we have one logical disk divided into many 
physical disks. If you want to know the constraints, call the controller 
and ask for it. The rest is bogus -- why should I have a partition table? 
Maybe divide the raid into smaller disks?!
That's it.
