It's pretty hard to move those bugfixes to the head of the queue.
Attached is an mbox of my unification work.  Maybe you could get your
two bugfixes applied to mainline kprobes_32/64.c, then my series
could go in as a merge later on.  Most of my stuff is in kprobes.c
post-unify so the merge would be trivial later.
Ingo, what do you think?  This rollup replaces all of my kprobes
patches to date.  So you could apply patched 1,2/6 from Masami
into 2.6.24 and let mine come in during 2.6.25 as a merge, which
would avoid the conflicts in kprobes_32|64.c?
