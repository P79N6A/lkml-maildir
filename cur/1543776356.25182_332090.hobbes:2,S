I've not been able to get dual channel I/O speed faster than single 
interface speed, either as 'md' RAID0 or simultaneous reading or 
writing done the other day:
Time to write or read 500MB file:

MB/s		2.4.31-hf1	2.6.12.2
		w	r	w	r
single		15	25	19	23
dual		17.5	27	19	26
These timings show very little happening in parallel, is that normal?
Thanks,
