If you interest in some real _music_ & sound-card, I
recomend Yamaha WF192XG (
http://www.waveforce.com/
).
Brief info:
PCI, HW 64 notes polyphony & other things like any other XG
music instrument (3 effect processors, 676  music instrument
voices, 21 drum kits, ...) - its better, than MU-50.
Driver: see

Sorry for off-topic.
Regs,
