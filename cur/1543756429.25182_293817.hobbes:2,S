The patch is supposed to speed the kernel up with at least some workloads. 
We 100% need to see testing results with some such workloads to verify that
the patch is desirable.
We also need to try to identify workloads whcih might experience a
regression and test them too.  It isn't very hard.

We now have a standard API for starting, binding and stopping kernel
threads.  It's best to use it.
