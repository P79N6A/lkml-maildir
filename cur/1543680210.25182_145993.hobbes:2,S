 That should be appropriately marked in the MP-table -- is it?  I think
clear_IO_APIC() should use the MP-table to select pins marked as mp_INT
(and possibly mp_ExtINT) only.  This way all special inputs are preserved.
 Your solution looks like a good hack for working around a broken
MP-table, but then a big fat warning should be printed about a BIOS bug.
