I also put the discovered status of each cpu other than the current one here. 
The structure is explained in the documentation part of the -mm patch.  Another 
thing I put here and have found to be very useful is the address that the stub 
was called from.  Often it is not clear just why we are in the stub, given that 
we trap such things as kernel page faults, NMI watchdog, BUG macros and such.  I 
have found, on occasion, that knowing this info has been key to understanding 
what was wrong.
