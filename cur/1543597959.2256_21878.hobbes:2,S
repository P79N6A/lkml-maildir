Most of the time that cast isn't needed and rather an indicator that
something else is wrong, right now we don't even have a chance to detect
such a situation.
Second, what's wrong with letting the compiler choose the appropriate
type? The compiler will still do it, if you change one of the types, but
the hardcoded type in min is too easy miss.
