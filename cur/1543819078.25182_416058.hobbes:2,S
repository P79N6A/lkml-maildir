If you choose the (experimental) CONFIG_EDD option in your kernel then, 
with cooperation of your BIOS, you'll have a /sys/firmware/edd with at 
least some info about the BIOS boot device. For me:
/sys/firmware/edd/
`-- int13_dev80
     |-- extensions
     |-- info_flags
     |-- legacy_max_cylinder
     |-- legacy_max_head
     |-- legacy_sectors_per_track
     |-- mbr_signature
     |-- raw_data
     |-- sectors
     `-- version
I do not appear to have enough information there to be able to translate 
back to the linux device but drivers/firmware/edd.c seems to imply there 
might be for others. As far as I'm aware, it's the best that's available 
at least.
Rene.
