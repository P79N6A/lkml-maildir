I've been completely unable to get cdrtools to compile... The version in
debian is 2.0a19, which works with IDE-SCSI, and doesn't work without
it. The RPM from the oss-dvd extension site doesn't work either without
IDE-SCSI. Nor does dvd+rwtools. Anyone attempting to write DVDs will
have real problems if IDE-SCSI is removed, judging by this experience.
