I stand corrected then. I didn't actually try anything with linphone, the
ALSA API just makes it look like the device nodes don't matter.

Well it looks like the ALSA library already abstracts the device node
enough that the app itself doesn't know what file is being used because it
just calls snd_card_get_name, snd_open_pcm, etc with the ALSA index. So
wouldn't it be feasible to make ALSA a little bit smarter so that it could
track/find the device nodes no matter what name they have? I'm not
advocating for or against it, but from my cursory look at the API it looks
possible to do without breaking any ALSA apps.
Jim.
