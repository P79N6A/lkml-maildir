I meant wrt what is had been working on in the filesystem. You'll need to do a
full fsck locally if it isn't journaled. Oh well.
Maybe it would help if you outlined your architecture as you see it right now.

Oh, so the discussion is a purely academic mind experiment; it would have been
helpful if you told us in the beginning.

So, your extensions are going to be "more" mainstream than OpenGFS / OCFS etc?
What the hell have you been smoking?
It has become apparent in the discussion that you are optimizing for a very
rare special case. OpenGFS, Lustre etc at least try to remain useable for
generic filesystem operation.
That it won't be mainstream is wrong about _your_ approach, not about those
"off the shelves" solutions.
And your special "optimisations" (like, no caching, no journaling...) are
supposed to be 10% _faster_ overall than these which are - to a certain extent
- from the ground up optimised for this case?
One of us isn't listening while clue is knocking. 
Now it might be me, but then I apologize for having wasted your time and will
stand corrected as soon as you have produced working code.
Until then, have fun. I feel like I am wasting both your and my time, and this
isn't strictly necessary.
Sincerely,
    Lars Marowsky-Brée <lmb@suse.de>
