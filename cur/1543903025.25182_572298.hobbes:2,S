Latter. IOW, that does mean, that mdio bus registered by this driver, now uses
same naming conventioun that other PHYLIB things use. Hereby it will make it able to be used in 
NIC drivers other than fs_enet (and gianfar and ucc_geth are now points of interest).

Hmm -so what are my options - change the description and resubmit?

I thought about it but this thing is more like the one that will never tend/required to change while\
configured.. Will add if you see it appropriate though.
