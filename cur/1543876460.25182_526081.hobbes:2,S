True, maybe the intersection is me + hw like that + radeon :-)

This is the thing it doesn't need to be linear, I have a GART onboard
the radeon that I can fill in, I just need internally in the kernel to
access it linearly and in userspace to map it linearly, but it doesn't
need to be physcially linear, vmalloc_32 + map_single should in theory
be possible if.. see below...

On a 64-bit machine GFP_KERNEL can give me any memory... it all works
fine on 32-bit highmem kernel as I don't get highmem... I really need
__GFP_DMA32 memory but we don't have a generic allocator that gives
this out that I can see..

Well I feed the bus address for each page into a GART table in the GPU
and it does the linear stuff internally in the GPU memory
controller...
I suppose I want __GFP_I_D_RATHER_DIE_THAN_BOUNCE.
