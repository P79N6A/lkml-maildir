I applied your bart+morton+hack rollup earlier today and it seems to be doing the right thing by me. The only problem I was having, was the suspend on restart and bios initialization delay (~ 15 seconds) because of it. That niggle was bugging me a bit and I'm glad to have it corrected.
So thanks Rene, Andrew and Bartlomiej :-)
