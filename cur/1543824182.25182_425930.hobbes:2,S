55 seconds to start an application... That´s not acceptable. Why do you
think it´s a Firefox problem? Did you try this with a Java application? 
I don´t wanna blame X in general, just saying it is useless if you´re
sitting in Hungary or Poland and want to work remotely - in comparision to
M$´s  RDP. 
The question for me is not "X or not X" - but how to enable people to start
e. g. "sam" on an HP-UX box without needing to wait minutes before the
application starts. It works - for sure, but the speed is for our needs not
acceptable. Additionally ~ 60 ssh sessions on a single box will but a lot of
CPU load on the system beside the fact, that you need a BIG BIG pipe.
