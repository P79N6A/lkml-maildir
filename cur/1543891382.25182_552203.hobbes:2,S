Right.  I did a lot of tricksy work for rc3-mm1 to merge git-ocfs2 on top
of Nick's stuff.  Then I repulled your tree and lost it all.  This is
because I was dumb and I fixed rc3-mm1's git-ocfs.patch rather than doing a
separate fix-rejects-in-git-ocfs2.patch.
This is all unique-to-akpm stuff which you don't need to worry about ;)

Is OK - I'll move Nick's patches back to behind the git trees and it'll all come
good.
