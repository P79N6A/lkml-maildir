Hi,
I used to be able to compile linux without CONFIG_NET, but in 2.5.41,
doing so makes compilation fail.  The reason is that net/socket.c
references `dev_ioctl', which is only defined when CONFIG_NET is
enabled.
I can avoid the problem like this:
--- ../orig/linux-2.5.41/net/socket.c	2002-10-10 11:40:28.000000000 +0900
+++ net/socket.c	2002-10-11 13:06:39.000000000 +0900

 	sock = SOCKET_I(inode);
+#ifdef CONFIG_NET
 	if (cmd >= SIOCDEVPRIVATE && cmd <= (SIOCDEVPRIVATE + 15)) {
 		err = dev_ioctl(cmd, (void *)arg);
 	} else
+#endif /* CONFIG_NET */
 #ifdef WIRELESS_EXT
 	if (cmd >= SIOCIWFIRST && cmd <= SIOCIWLAST) {
 		err = dev_ioctl(cmd, (void *)arg);
It seems to work fine, but I have no idea if this is really the correct
solution or not.
I'd appreciate it if someone could look at this and install a fix.
Thanks,
