OK. But I'm still worry. Please consider the following code
       for (...; ...; ...) {
                [...]
                if (pfn_valid(i))
                       num_physpages++;
                [...]
        }
In that case num_physpages won't store an accurate value. Still it will be
used by the kernel to make some statistic assumptions on other kernel
data structure sizes.
