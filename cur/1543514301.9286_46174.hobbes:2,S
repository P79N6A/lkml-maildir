    Sorry for the inconvenience. I=B4m using 2.2.10.
Good. (And also Quoted Unreadable, I see. Not so good.)

    Nope. I jumpered it to 1.., just like the documentation proposes.

    ide1: BM-DMA at 0xf008-0xf00f, BIOS settings: hdc:pio, hdd:pio
    hdc: FUJITSU MPB3032ATU, ATA DISK drive
    hdc: FUJITSU MPB3032ATU, 2014MB w/0kB Cache, CHS=3D4092/16/63, (U)DMA
    hdc: hdc1

    michael:/home/michael # hdparm -i /dev/hdc
    /dev/hdc:
     Model=3DFUJITSU MPB3032ATU, FwRev=3D2009, SerialNo=3D01138683
     RawCHS=3D4092/16/63, TrkSize=3D0, SectSize=3D0, ECCbytes=3D4
     CurCHS=3D4092/16/63, CurSects=3D4124736, LBA=3Dyes, LBAsects=3D4124736
    Ok, now have a look at this. I don=B4t know why the "-I" =
    parameter screws things up like this:
    michael:/home/michael # hdparm -I /dev/hdc
    /dev/hdc:
     Model=3DUFIJST UPM3B30A2UT                      , FwRev=3D0290    ,
     RawCHS=3D4092/16/63, TrkSize=3D0, SectSize=3D0, ECCbytes=3D4
     CurCHS=3D4364/15/63, CurSects=3D4123980, LBA=3Dyes, LBAsects=3D4124736
The same in both cases, except that the model is given in BigEndian order
and -i corrects for that but -I doesnt.
And by now it is completely clear what happens on the Linux side.
The drive reports LBAsects=4124736, so it says that its total capacity
is 2.11 GB, a standard clipped capacity. Most disks only clip the CHS info
and let the operating system know the truth via LBAcapacity, but this disk
cheats on all fronts so that Linux has no way of knowing total capacity.
So, you'll have to boot with boot parameter hdc=6704,15,63.
Now this is precisely the behaviour one would expect with jumpers
set to `clip'. I am surprised that this disk still does this with
jumpers in default position.
So, I understand the Linux side but not the disk side of things.
