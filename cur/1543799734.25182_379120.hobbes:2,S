Since you do not explain how you performed the test, it is hard to
comment, but I don't see this behaviour you describe:
trondmy@lade test$ ls -al
total 12
drwxrwxrwx   2 root root 4096 2005-12-25 10:42 .
drwxrwxrwt  10 root root 4096 2005-12-25 10:41 ..
-rw-r--r--   1 root root    5 2005-12-25 10:42 test
trondmy@lade test$ cat >test
bash: test: Permission denied
If I use 'vi' to edit the file, then it can be modified, but the way vi
does that is to delete the old file, and create a new one with the same
name (and it will only do this if you use 'w!'). That should ordinarily
work on Solaris too.
Cheers,
