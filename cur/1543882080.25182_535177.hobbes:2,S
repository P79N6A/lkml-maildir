Those are different issues - hardware hot/cold plugging for the first.
Changing the kernel through a cycle - that's not a design fault. The
problem there is that the kernel and it's associated data structures are
part of the state. Changing the kernel and keeping the image would
require exactly correspondence in data structures, memory map and so on.
That's why the same kernel is required.

That's what Rafael and I working on.
