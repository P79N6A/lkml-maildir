Hi,
some thoughts on shared futexes;
Could we get rid of the mmap_sem on the shared futexes in the following
manner:
 - do a page table walk to find the pte;
 - get a page using pfn_to_page (skipping VM_PFNMAP)
 - get the futex key from page->mapping->host and page->index
   and offset from addr % PAGE_SIZE.
or given a key:
 - lookup the page from key.shared.inode->i_mapping by key.shared.pgoff
   possibly loading the page using mapping->a_ops->readpage().
then:
 - perform the futex operation on a kmap of the page
This should all work except for VM_PFNMAP.
Since the address is passed from userspace we cannot trust it to not
point into a VM_PFNMAP area.
However, with the RCU VMA lookup patches I'm working on we could do that
check without holding locks and without exclusive cachelines; the
question is, is that good enough?
Or is there an alternative way of determining a pfnmap given a
pfn/struct page?
