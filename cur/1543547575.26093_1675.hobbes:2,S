	Hello,
	Looking in inet_select_addr() it seems that ifa->ifa_local
is selected according to the target. So, may be the problem is not
that the announced address in the ARP request is the primary address.
Someone already selected the primary address before arp_solicit.
Because arp_solicit uses the saddr if it is local and calls
inet_select_addr() if it is not local. Let's try it with non-local
address:
	just try "traceroute -s 111.111.111.111 d.e.f.2"
	What shows this simple test?
arp who-has d.e.f.2 tell a.b.c.1
or
arp who-has d.e.f.2 tell d.e.f.1
If the announced address is d.e.f.1 then there is no problem in
inet_select_addr() but your application is already bound to the
primary address.
