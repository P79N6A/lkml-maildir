Subject: [patch 00/28] cmpxchg_local standardization across architectures

Hi,
Here is the patchset that performs cmpxchg_local and cmpxchg64_local
standardization across architectures. It uses interrupt save/restore to emulate
the atomic operation on architectures lacking such atomic op.
We have seen interesing performance gain in slub on architectures where the
local cmpxchg is faster than interrupt disable, namely x86 and amd64. It becomes
less interesting on architectures lacking atomic ops and where the only cmpxchg
primitive available is almost as fast as irq disable/enable (ia64); a small
performance hit can be expected, mostly due to the additionnal memory barriers
it adds to the code (and the fact that it is faster to disable interrupts once
for a longer time rather than multiple times).
It applies in this order on 2.6.23-mm1 :
