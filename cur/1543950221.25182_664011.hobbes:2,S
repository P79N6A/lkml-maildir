out of curiosity: yesterday I've seen a box[0] with ~4 TB Committed_AS:
CommitLimit:   3085152 kB
Committed_AS: 4281048084 kB
VmallocTotal:   118776 kB
VmallocUsed:     13772 kB
VmallocChunk:   103880 kB
Since it's a rather old kernel (2.6.19.2), I just want to know: could this 
be related to what you've seen or this completely different (and 
Committed_AS is just this high because some st00pid app has allocated this 
much memory but not freed again)?
Thanks,
Christian.
