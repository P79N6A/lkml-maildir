  It seems to handle quotas fine - the block allocation itself does not
differ from the usual case, just the extents in the tree are marked as
uninitialized...
  The only question is whether DQUOT_PREALLOC_BLOCK() shouldn't be
called instead of DQUOT_ALLOC_BLOCK(). Then fallocate() won't be able to
allocate anything after the softlimit has been reached which makes some
sence but probably current behavior is kind-of less surprising.
