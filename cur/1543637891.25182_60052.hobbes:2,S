Sizing the mempool to max_cpus * max tree depth provides a guarantee,
provided you take care of context switches, which is pretty easy.

Not sure.  If each ratnode has a 64-bit bitmap which represents
dirty pages if it's a leaf node, or nodes which have dirty pages
if it's a higher node then the "find the next 16 dirty pages above index
N" is a pretty efficient thing.
Tricky to code though.
