Octal values start with '0' when they're numerical values.  When they're 
in strings as escape characters, the C syntax is "\nnn".  Every 
reference I find says that.  Some script languages, however require that 
octal values start with '0' in strings, so csh would expect to see "\0nnn".
Additionally, when I compile in the dictionary into the program that
does the string replacement, I get no complaints, although every
character in there is "\nnn".
