Build a 386 kernel no problem.
Build a 486 kernel small random, minor.
Build a 586 kernel noticable problems, and permission fail.
Build a 686 kerenl and the disk data will fry.
It took me 5 weeks to reduce the variables and derive this answer.
There is a timing issue that is drive dependent on the PIIX3/4.
It is an echo bounce in the trigger levels of the signal gating.
This is line chatter on the bus that I have only observed with a WDC and
Maxtor pair on the same channel.

WDC drives blow off the CRC check of UDMA.........This is BAD and STUPID.
Several of the OEM chipset makers have allowed this crap to exist.
ATA-2 (style) can not handle ATA-3/4 transfer rates without the CRC
checks, you end up continuing the DMA writing regardless if you lost data
that would have been saved if the UDMA CRC was intact.
This is a pure hardware issue........I do not know yet if there is a way
to check/recover with out death to DMAing for all WDC products.
The best case at the moment is to consider blocking all WDC products from
using the ATA-3 and newere standard.
