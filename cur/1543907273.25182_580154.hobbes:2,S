Not that I want to be in this thread, particularly since it is already 
two weeks stale, but your take on the EVMS story is incorrect.  The 
EVMS developers (that is, Kevin) sent out a nice, conciliatory email, 
the project sputtered on for a while, then basically died.

Bill is right.  People who know people are right.  A lot of good talent 
has been lost to Linux over the years because of various, perhaps good 
intentioned, gaffs.  The thing is, if you contribute to a project like 
Linux for fun, when it stops being fun you walk.

Daniel
