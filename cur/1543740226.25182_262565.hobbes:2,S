That sounds like a bit of overdesign, really.  Take it one step at a time.
Sure, if you're really prepared to do a large-scale overhaul then the first
step is to create a new top-level directory, say
"./non-crappy-Documentation" and then move files over into there as they
are fixed up.  That way we have a good handle on what is done and what
remains.  You can then make decisions about the directory structure
on an incremental basis as you become more familiar with the problem.

Maintainers studiously ignore the Documentation directory.  If someone
really wishes to get in there and fix it all up, that person gets to decide
what goes where and that person gets to harrass various other maintainers
when assistance is needed.
