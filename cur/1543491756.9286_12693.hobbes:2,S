Why? I've got my parport on 0x378.
From linux/Documentation/devices.txt :
6 char  Parallel printer device
                  0 = /dev/lp0          First parallel printer (0x3bc)
                  1 = /dev/lp1          Second parallel printer (0x378)
                  2 = /dev/lp2          Third parallel printer (0x278)
                Not all computers have the 0x3bc parallel port; hence
                the "first" printer may be either /dev/lp0 or
                /dev/lp1
At the end I could get it run and I still got my priter on lp1
