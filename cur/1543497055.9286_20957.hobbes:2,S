NT 3.1 through 3.51 were basically microkernel.  Get a copy of _Operating
System Concepts_, by Abraham Silberschatz and Peter Baer Galvin, which as
well as being a great introduction to operating system design, has three
chapters devoted to Classic Unix, NT, and Linux respectively.
The big screwup was putting the graphics code back in the kernel with 4.0.
Anyway, this isn't about Linux :)
