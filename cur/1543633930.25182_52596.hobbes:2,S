Why is this 'one random item' ??
For usb-storage devices the GUID is built using Vendor ID & Device ID and 
the device's Serial Nr.
For identification purposes, the serial number is useless without Vendor ID 
& Device ID.
Ofcourse we'll never have a change of creating stable name for devices that 
don't have a serialnr.

Sure. But
a) not easily readable
b) totall different for FireWire devices
c) race-conditions (reading multiple files).

Exactly, but finding this out at the moment involves reading: 
/proc/scsi/scsi, scanning /proc/scsi/usb-storage-*, scanning 
/proc/scsi/usb-storage-X/*, reading /proc/scsi/usb-storage-X/Y.

Well that's just SCM, huh ? The newer SCM-Orca chipset has a S/N.

But the LUN-map for such a device will never change ?
Incase a device has 4 LUN's, well have 4 /proc/scsi/map entries with the 
same GUID.
The hotplug agent will indeed be watching GUID+Lun.
