Some more information:
This is not purely theoretical. Rupesh is actually
working a problem where he has seen the N_TTY buffer overflow
and the canonical state variables get out of sync with read_cnt, etc.
This patch seems obviously correct, if N_TTY drops a
char due to a full buffer the rest of the character
processing should not take place. Particularly in this
case where the extra processing leaves the tty structure
in an inconsistent state.
