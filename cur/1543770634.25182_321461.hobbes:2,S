 In blk_do_barrier() above patch implements, when a barrier request is
terminated w/ -EOPNOTSUPP, the request is not dequeued.  The following
patch fixes this.  The fixed path is a very rare error path, so, for
reviewing, this patch doesn't make much difference.  I'll use properly
regenerated patch on the next posting of this patchset.
