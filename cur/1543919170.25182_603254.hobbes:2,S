The more I try understand the IPI handling the more confused I get. :(
At fist I was concerned about an IPI happening in the middle of the
__schedule routine.  But, then it occurred to me that interrupts are
disabled when in this routine (when holding the runqueue lock).  So, IPIs
are not delivered during __schedule processing.  Right?
But, if this is case then I don't understand the following code in
schedule():
        local_irq_disable();
        do {
                __schedule();
        } while (unlikely(test_thread_flag(TIF_NEED_RESCHED) ||
                          test_thread_flag(TIF_NEED_RESCHED_DELAYED)));
        local_irq_enable();
How can the reschedule flags possibly be set AFTER running __schedule.
Especially when the call is explicitly surrounded by local_irq_disable/
local_irq_enable.
Can someone help me?
