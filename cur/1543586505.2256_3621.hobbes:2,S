Hmmm... most of our embedded systems are based on a PC somehow either via a processor card or  
an actual PC system that we design so perhaps I have't stressed the limits yet.
We do actually use SST (Silcon Storage Technolog) CF's as well and they seem to function just 
identical to the SanDisk but not quite as robust... I have had several of the SST's develope 
a problem in the partition table and as thus the just error when you try to mount them.
Several people on the liunx-embedded list also have similar experiences.
That seems to follow your observations...
Will it be worth while for you if I break out the scope and examine how our CF's handle the 
PDIAG signal or can we just go on faith that they do indeed work as expected?
