Sorry, have been out sick, and someone removed me from the cc list,
which didn't help. In response to various bits:
Firstly a general comment - we're about to upgrade versions, which
will ease a few of these issues. I should really finish the creation
of virtual category owners for *all* categories. Will see if we can
batch that, as it's a total pain to do.

The category owners should be able to do that, and help spread the
load. The virtual category owner stuff enables many people to "watch"
new bugs for that category and help out.

Fairly easy to do, just a permissions issue. Either I can add a bunch
of "known" people, or let everyone do it and then slap people if
they're silly about it.

I can make that clearer in the form if it helps.

I *think* that's in the new version. Will check.

Yes, though we could do with some improved email hooks still, I guess.
I much prefer having people watch categories than spamming lists, but
if people want lists spammed, we can have that.
