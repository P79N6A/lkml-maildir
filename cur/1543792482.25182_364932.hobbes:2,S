Sucky implementation isn't a reason for removal.  It's a reason to fix
sucky implementation.

It allows users to write an image to a NAND device that has bad blocks
and not totally screw it up.  This is possible because of those ioctls.
The mtdblock stuff knows nothing of this.
I do agree that the read-only devices don't make sense.  The code itself
probably needs work too.  But until someone takes the time to make the
mtdblock devices have equivalent functionality, mtdchar needs to stay.
(And mtdblock has it's own set of issues as well.  I'd be happy to
discuss them, but I think it would be offtopic for this thread.)
