I'm surprised to see this merged, even as a place holder.  Primarily
because the same approach was soundly rejected for LSM and sys_security.
  For 2.6 I'd like to do things right.  At the moment the vserver patch
  has sys_new_s_context and sys_set_ipv4root calls, but since we'll
  probably end up getting an ipv6 call too and people are planning future
  functionality, I guess it would be more appropriate to multiplex these
  through one sys_vserver patch, in the same way sys_ipc works.
Multiplexing, future functionality, etc...this reasoning was shot down
before.   The preferred method was to have well-typed interfaces that 
are simple and not overloaded.  Any chance some of these needs could be
met with existing infrastructure in 2.6?  For example, similar to the
sys_new_s_context issue was resolved for LSM with the /proc/pid/attr/
interface, could this be reused?
I'm not trying to instigate a flame, just understand where this is
going.  Sorry if I missed the discussion already.
thanks,
