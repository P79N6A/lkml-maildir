Subject: [PATCH 5/5] UML - reconst a parameter
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The previous const-ing patch consted a string which shouldn't have
been, and I didn't notice the gcc warning.
ubd_setup can't take a const char * because its address is assigned to
something which expects a char *arg.  Many setups modify the string
they are given, they can't be const.
