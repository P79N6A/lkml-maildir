True.

Almost.  TASK_INTERACTIVE(p) doesn't mean the task is an interactive
task, only that it sleeps enough that it may be.  Interactive tasks can
generally be categorized as doing quite a bit of sleeping, but so do
other things.  HTTP/FTP daemons etc etc.
In the presence of a mixed load with several "interactive" components,
timeslice scaling can only do harm to throughput by further fragmenting
the already shattered time a task spends on cpu.  You don't want to
increase the context switch rate if you want throughput.

Time spent in the expired array limits the !TASK_INTERACTIVE(p).  In a
mixed load, the sleeping task component is the one which needs
controlling, because it will always preempt and get it's share of cpu.
In a pure hog load, the scheduler is pure round-robin, so no scaling is
needed.  It's the sleep deprived who need protection from the swarms of
preempt enabled.
