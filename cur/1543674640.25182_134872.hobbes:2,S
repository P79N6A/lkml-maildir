This function is small and very useful, I think it should be included unconditional
and the prototype maybe moved to kernel.h.

The name is a bit mislead.  maybe ioctl_usercopy?  ioctl_uaccess?
Also file/inode should go away from the prototype (and the callback).
Only file is needed because inode == file->f_dentry->d_inode, and even
that one should be just some void *data instead.

That's crap.  Please move this workaround to v4l not into generic code.

I wonder whether you should just kmalloc always.

I don't think this is the right place for this substitution - leave it to
the drivers.
