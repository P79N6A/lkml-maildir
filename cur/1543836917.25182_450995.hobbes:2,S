That which talks about character devices, in particular ttys.
NetBSD revoke(2):

Irix revoke(2) even mentions:

It seems, revoke was intended to disable access to tty devices
from old processes in a controlled way.  Sounds sane.
Your implementation is much cruder - it simply takes the fd
away from the app; any future use gives EBADF.  As a bonus,
it works for regular files and even goes as far as destroying
all mappings of the file from all processes (even root processes).
IMVHO this is a disaster from a security and reliability point
of view.
So, the behaviour regarding ttys is completely different to
other implementations and for other types of fds the Linux
semantic seems unique (the man-pages of the other systems
are pretty silent about that).
A serious question: What do you need this feature of revoking
regular files (or block devices) for?  Maybe my imagination
is lacking, but I can't find a use where fuser(1) (or similar
tools) wouldn't be as good or even better than revoke(2).
Ciao, ET.
