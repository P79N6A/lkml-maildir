Actually, the HE driver is a more recent addition. But I have to
admit that my own drivers have more #ifdefs than really necessary,
too. Also, I saw my role more as that of an integrator than a
reviewer, so I let people do whatever they liked in their drivers.
Ah, the good old times, when everything was better ;-)
