It may be obvious for "people in the know" but just for the record.
2.2.2pre5, and now also 2.2.1-ac7 which synchronised with it, does
not compile on Alpha and most likely also on any other architecture
but Intel.  The reason for that is __down_trylock and related stuff
which, at least at this moment, is Intel specific.  I am afraid that
I do not know how to fix that (without backing out these changes,
of course).
Also 2.2.1-ac7 still informs in a "help" message after "make config",
or "make oldconfig", or similar that: "... you may run 'make zImage',
'make zdisk', or 'make zlilo'".  This is not going to fly anywhere
but on Intel.  Why not to replace 'make zImage' with 'make boot'?
This happens to be equivalent on Intel and it also works elsewhere.
A discussions about merits of 'make bzImage' vs. 'make zImage' is
another topic altogether.
