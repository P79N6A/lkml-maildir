Settle down Christoph, the compat_ioctl method is less than 3 months
old, has only been in one official 2.6.x release, and isn't documented
at all in the Documentation directory AFAICS.  Don't be so impatient.
Anyway, I did the 32-bit ioctl conversion stuff for the DRM.  I'll
look at changing it to use compat_ioctl.  The big question of course
is whether the DRM code will work correctly without the BKL held.
Paul.
