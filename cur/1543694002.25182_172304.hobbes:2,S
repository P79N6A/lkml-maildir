Frank,
     man 2 stat
  i_blocks a.k.a. stat->st_blocks is _defined_ to be in 512byte
units. It bears no relation to the st_blksize. If you don't like that,
spec then by all means appeal to the POSIX committee that wrote
it. (You probably wouldn't be the first to do so)
  Pending the outcome of such an appeal, though, the patch must be
rejected...
Cheers,
  Trond
