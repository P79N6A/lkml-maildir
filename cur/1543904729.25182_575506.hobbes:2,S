It is *not* KDB specific problem. Please grep in mainline kernel. You can find
some function using panic_notifier_list. (IPMI, softdog, heartbeat, etc...)
My patch gives a chance to use kdump for panic_notifier user. It is good for
kdump too, because kdump user goes to increase. :-)
Bernhard's idea (kdump uses panic_notifier) is very good for me. But it isn't
good for kdump user, because they want to take a dump ASAP when panicked.
Vivek, please think about this problem again.
If there is a developer who has the opinion on this problem, please give us your
opinion.
Thanks.
