I got this too, and started wondering where they got my name from. It
seems as if someone went though a decent amount of effort to select a set
of names. I was quite impressed that a company was actually showing
interest in *hiring* and *paying* people who have demonstrated at least
some amount of involemnt in the Linux community.
Have you noticed that a good percentage of the best Linux work (kernel and
userland) comes from people employed by linux-friendly companies? (Linus
Torvolds and Alan Cox have kernel hacking as at least a small part of
their job description, even though it might be an unofficial
understanding)
Please don't bite the hand that may end up feeding the future development
of Linux!
That being said, I would have appreciated a explaination of how/why my
name was selected.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You have 'Computer Consultant' in your signature. If you don't want people
trying hire you to do things, don't call yourself a consultant. ;)
