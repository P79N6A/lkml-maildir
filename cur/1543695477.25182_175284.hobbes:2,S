Irrelevant!
I am assuming that these numbers are applicable (one is
unknown):
	logical sector size == 512B
	physical sector size == ???B
	page size/filesystem block size == 4KB
Whether the write of a 4KB block is a single 4KB write or 8
512B writes i expect the drive will gather it so that 4KB is
being written.  If that 4KB (or whatever size write) is less
than the size of a physical sector a read-modify-write cycle
must occur inside the drive.  If the read portion of the
read-modify-write fails the requested write(s) must either fail
or data in the logical sectors adjacent to the write will
become corrupted.  This is whether or not the physical
sector is relocated.
Judging by logic and earlier discussions on the matter of
write errors if that write fails because of a read error in
the read-modify-write to the application it would appear to
have succeeded unless it were synchronous all the way to the
media.
This sounds very much like the described behaviour of the
Toshiba drive that started this whole thread.
To the best of my knowledge we have no way to know what the
physical sector size of a disk is.  For that matter it might
not even be a constant.  Perhaps the someone could inform us
what the drive will actually do if the read portion of a
read-modify-write fails.
