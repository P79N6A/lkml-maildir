Not if what I suggested is happening is really what's happening.
(Quoted next.)
It's got to be just a *simple* hardware race, and the msleep would
reliably prevent it since the switch takes a finite amount of time
to do its job.  I've had to struggle with real heisenbugs, and this
doesn't have enough conflicting behaviors inside the silicon (or
poor enough design) to qualify.

So, you're unwilling to explore whether that suggestion addresses
this problem.

As Alan noted: no can do, in general.  That's why I've not griped
harder at the distro vendors who are ignoring the fairly simple
recommendation that's been around for six years now:  load EHCI
before other USB controller drivers.  
Admittedly, until you turned up this glitch there was no downside
known beyond the boot slowdown.

It's in a different mailbox, sorry.

It will exit by the inner loop (with diagnostic) before it exits
from the outer one.  Then the hub logic and other code will give
even more messages.

The version I sent should just merge.
