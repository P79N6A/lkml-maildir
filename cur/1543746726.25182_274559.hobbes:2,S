Doesn't most of the kernel have debugging code in it? Maybe not as much,
but most of the kernel isn't doing the same thing. Remember we have the
option of compiling it out. If it lives as a separate patch, we're just
making more work for me (I have to maintain the debug version and then
make some transformation on it to get the mainline version).
By the way, I'm really appreciating your interaction over all these
points. I was getting worried that I wasn't getting enough. I should say
now, too, that I'm away all weekend, so you won't get replies tomorrow
and the day after.
Thanks and regards,
Nigel
