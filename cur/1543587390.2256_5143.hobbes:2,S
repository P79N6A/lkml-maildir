Actually, this is the case if we call shrink_dcache_memory() with priority
zero.  It calls prune_dcache(count = 0), which gets into the situation you
describe (i.e. negative count).  I first thought this was a bug, but then
realized for priority 0 (i.e. highest priority) we want to check the whole
dentry_unused list for unreferenced dentries.
Cheers, Andreas
