The PNP0C01 ports are not used by the kernel !
No modifications necessary.
Of course you can teach each driver about their PNP devices, e.g.
my patch for parport_pc.c makes perfect io/irq/dma detection and
saves users from the error-prone procedure to supply module parameters.
Even serial now autodetects IRQ 10 when I give this in my BIOS setup !

So we have another way besides several INTs to detect the avail mem :-)

Gerd's patch rules out your objections and should be included
unconditionally with pnpbios.o.
Probably PNP0C02 wants to be reserved, too.
