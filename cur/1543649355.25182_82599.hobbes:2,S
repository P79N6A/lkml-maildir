Historically, this causes an ints-off lockup, but I think we've
fixed all them now ;)

More by good luck than by good judgement, if there are zero inactive
pages in a zone we come out of shrink_caches with max_scan equal
to SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX*2.  So if all of a zone's pages are out in
pagetables/skbuffs/whatever we'll put a lot of pressure on slab.
Which is good.  But it'll do that even if the offending zone cannot
contain any slab, which is not so good, but not very serious in
practice.  Search for "FIXME"...
