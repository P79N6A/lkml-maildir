Subject: Kernel 2.3.49 crashes with ISDN callback

When using ISDN with callback enabled kernels 2.3.4[89] crash.  It happens
shortly after the callback arrives.  First there is a warning about
kfree_skb and then an oops due to a NULL pointer dereference and finally
a kernel panic: `trying to kill the idle task'.
ISDN without callback does work.
I have a Teles 16.3c ISA/PnP card and am using the HFC-S driver.  I am using
syncppp encapsulation.
I can also provide the details of the oops if wanted.
