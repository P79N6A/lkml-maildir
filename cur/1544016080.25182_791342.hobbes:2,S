Hi,
i´ve got the same problem with 2.6.29-rc1 and a thinkpad T61p. But there is something very strange with 2.6.29-rc1-git3 it works perfectly.

I tested rc1+ these two reverts yesterday on my T61p. Doesnt work. There must 
be at least one more patch that broke S2R on my thinkpad. In fact, it is cpu 
hotplug that is broken (unplug works).
I will try to bisect that as well, but currently I am busy trying to find a 
virtio regression....
