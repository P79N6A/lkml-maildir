Well it depends how generic the mbcache code is supposed to be.
The kernel has just gained supoprt for 64-bit sectors on ia32
and PPC32 but the new mbcache code will not support that.
I guess if there are no current 64-bit users of mbcache then
it can be deferred until there is a need.

Might do.  There's hash_long() in <linux/hash.h>
