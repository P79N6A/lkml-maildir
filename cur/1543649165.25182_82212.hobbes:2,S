Actually, I sent a patch to Linus for this driver that I think made it 
into 2.5.44.  Andy, could you let me know if 2.5.44 works?  If not, then 
I'll see what I can find.  Side note: Mike's right about the error 
handling being horked, but that shouldn't really make any difference in 
bootup since it shouldn't be needing error recovery.
