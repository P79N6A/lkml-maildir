Yes, indeed.

Methinks there are at least two possibilities that could do everything we
might need here without unnecessary complications.
One is just mount a ramdisk and extract a tarball into its root. Yes, this has
some problems -- how do you load tar when you haven't set up your root? -- but
I suspect they can be solved. At worst, this would involve some strictly limited
kluge to do that.
A better approach might be to find or invent a generic compressed file system.
Given that, you just build a compressed root, copy an image of it into ramdisk
and let the compressed FS driver handle it from there. I suspect such a driver
might be useful elsewhere as well. Does one exist?
