agreed... after the problematic inclusion of 0.9 into the kernel i
asked on sistina LVM list whether they could try to be a bit more
proactive about feeding patches on to linus, to make life easier for
LVM users - they had fixes for the problems of 0.9 but never, and
still to this day have not, fed the code on.
Still to this day, nothing from them but announcements on l-k of
various betas. AFAIK all the patches for LVM submitted to linus since
0.8 went in have been from core linux developers (Andrea, Jens,
etc.), not sistina.
shame... their LVM is really nice to use. Just frustrating that they
do want to feed the code on... more frustrating still when you
consider the lobbying that went on to try persuade l-k that LVM
should go in.
