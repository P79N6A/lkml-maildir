Subject: [stable][patch] x86_64: fix number of ia32 syscalls
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Recent discussions about whether to print a message about unimplemented
ia32 syscalls on x86_64 have missed the real bug: the number of ia32
syscalls is wrong in 2.6.16.  Fixing that kills the message.
