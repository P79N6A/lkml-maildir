Yup, if SD_NODES_PER_DOMAIN is set to 4, our 32-way TX-7 have 
two disjoint domains ;(
(though the current default is 6 for ia64...)
I think the default configuration of the scheduler domains should be
as identical to its real hardware topology as possible, and should
modify the default only when necessary (e.g. for Altix).
Right now with the sched domain scheduler, we have to setup the 
domain hierarcy only at boot time statically, which makes it harder to
find the optimal domain topology/parameter.  The dynamic patch
makes it easier to modify the default configuration.
If the scheduler gains more dynamic configurability like what Jesse
said, it adds more flexibility for runtime optimization and seems
a way to go.  I'm not sure runtime configurability of domain topology
is necessary for all users, but it's extremely useful for developers.
I'll look into the Matt's patch further.
