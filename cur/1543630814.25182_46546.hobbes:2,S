   My main want is cosmetic -- call a spade a spade, so to speak. 
    s/sysdata/pci_domain/  But doing so opens the door to increased 
   flexibility.  Later steps can add common members needed by pci-to-pci 
   IOMMU tricks which are common to most platforms.
Since the name really doesn't matter let's call it struct pci_controller
since that is what Alpha and Sparc use already :-)
