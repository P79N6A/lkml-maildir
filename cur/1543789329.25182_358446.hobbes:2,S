Did I say these patches were bad in general? All I'm asking for is an 
explanation for a few design decisions to understand the patch and its 
behaviour better and evaluate alternative solutions.
Neither of you have shown any real interest in this so far.

This "shut up and show code" attitude is sometimes quite funny, but it's 
no real threat to me. I hoped to avoid this and solve this more civilized. 
Of course I'll understand the issues better afterwards, but you could as 
easily just tell me. It will waste my time, I could spend on other 
projects and it will put Andrew in the unfortunate position to decide, 
which patch to accept.
Is this really what you want?
bye, Roman
