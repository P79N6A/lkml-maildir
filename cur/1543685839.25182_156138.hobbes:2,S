Subject: [PATCH] IDE (& PowerMac): Let an hwif have a real parent
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Hi Linus & Bart !
This patch allows an IDE hwif to be set a "parent" field so it
can really descend from any struct device, typically the macio_device
I use on pmac, and not only a PCI device or the legacy stuff.
This should work fine as long as hwif->gendev.parent doesn't
contain junk, but so far, it seems it really only contains
NULL unless specifically set by the host driver.
Without that, the pmac driver will not appear in it's proper
location in the device tree, which is a real problem for power
management as it won't be ordered properly with it's hosting
asic (and mediabay if any), thus breaking suspend/resume.
Please apply,
Ben.
