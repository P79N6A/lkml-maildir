Also because you can't do a proper job from user-mode.  The only tool available
is readlink, but readlink and followlink are different operations in the VFS
interface.  In other words, its possible for a filesystem to put one thing in a
symlink as far as readlink goes, and do another when you try to follow it. 
/proc has many examples of this, and it is not unique.
You may be able to do it if you add an appropriate syscall.
