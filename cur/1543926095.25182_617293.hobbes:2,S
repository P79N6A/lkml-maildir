It's extreme but not *quite* as extreme as you imply. The whole free-lists are
not searched, just one set at a specific order so it's "search a portion of
the free-lists". It happens for non-movable allocations (usually the minority)
and only then in fallback (in itself quite rare in almost all cases I've seen).
The problem was not detected before by me because it wasn't just a case of
creating a large number of pinned allocations but also depended on the type
of workload preceding it. If mke2fs was long-lived, it might not even have
been noticed. When run more than once, the fallbacks have all been dealt
with and it goes back to normal times.
The patch is now reverted and I don't expect to try bringing it back.
There are ways to bias the placement the pages as the patch intended without
doing an expensive search.
