Which usb to serial converter?  Not all of them work with Linux.  Does
this device work with Linux _not_ as a serial console device?

Which "serial console" are you trying to get working?  The kernel log
console, or a login console?

What web page says you can build this modular?  You have to build it
into the kernel.

Can you show us the relevant part of the kernel logs?

You are headed for frustration.  USB serial console was a neat hack, but
pretty pointless.  It has the following problems:
	- can't see oopses before USB starts up, and USB starts up
	  almost last in the system boot process.
	- really can not capture oopses very well as USB is interrupt
	  driven
	- most usb-serial converters have a very small buffer, so you
	  constantly get over-runs in printing out console messages
	  (meaning that only a few of the devices will even work
	  properly, you usually have to buy one of the expensive ones to
	  see all messages.)

Buy a machine with a serial port.  That's my recommendation :)
Good luck,
