a) /dev/zero: character device, no buffers used at all. /tmp/moo: regular
file, data goes into pagecache, so all buffers you will get out of it
will be for indirect blocks. Assuming 4Kb filesystem that would be about
13Kb worth. Userland buffer is in pagecache too, indeed.
b) invalidate on last close.
