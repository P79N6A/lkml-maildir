Hi,
I would like to report that the problems noted  by 
myself are solved by the installation of
the latest 2.2.11 kernel.
(A couple of similar, but not exact problems
had been reported earlier.)
It seems that the fixes 2.2.11 of the fs/ext2 code for tigher checking
of bogus inode values, and other corrections in various
parts of the kernel solved the problem of
handling of faulty hard disk (MEDIUM ERROR, etc.)
in SCSI higher level code.
Obviously the change of timeout from 15sec to 30sec (which
is in the kernel change for 2.2.11) was the major stabilization factor.
Thank you for the kernel hackers for these corrections.
(I don't know if the SCSI tape errors are handled
well or not by the latest kernel. Those who have experienced the
tape medium errors or rather the problems of recovering
from such errors with SCSI tape drives might want to check
the latest kernel and report their experience.)
TIA.
Happy Hacking
