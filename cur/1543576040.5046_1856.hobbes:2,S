Hi.
In the link phase of a kernel 240t13p2 build I get the following:
drivers/char/char.o: In function `tty_init':
drivers/char/char.o(.text.init+0x259): undefined reference to `riscom8_init'
I guess this is bacause riscom8_init is now a static function and thus
tty_init cannot see it. If this is intentional or nat I cannot judge
but I guess the fix is either to remove the static or the initcall from
tty_init. The decision I leave with those who know what to do.
