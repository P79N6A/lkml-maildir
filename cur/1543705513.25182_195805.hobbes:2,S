Jens said there was no specific command to do this in another post,
although I would have thought that a generic device reset command
should clear the cache, but be sub-optimal for devices which clear the
cache themselves on an erase.
Regardless of specs, I don't know what the majority of devices in the
real world actually do.  Maybe Jens and Alan, (cc'ed), can help.
John.
