Subject: [PATCH 1/4] i386: Restore CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START option
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/12/27/28

o Relocatable bzImage support had got rid of CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START option
  thinking that now this option is not required as people can build a
  second kernel as relocatable and load it anywhere. So need of compiling
  the kernel for a custom address was gone. But Magnus uses vmlinux images
  for second kernel in Xen environment and he wants to continue to use
  it.
o Restoring the CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START option for the time being. I think
  down the line we can get rid of it.

+	  This gives the physical address where the kernel is loaded.
+
+	  If kernel is a not relocatable (CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=n) then
+	  bzImage will decompress itself to above physical address and
+	  run from there. Otherwise, bzImage will run from the address where
+	  it has been loaded by the boot loader and will ignore above physical
+	  address.
+
+	  In normal kdump cases one does not have to set/change this option
+	  as now bzImage can be compiled as a completely relocatable image
+	  (CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=y) and be used to load and run from a different
+	  address. This option is mainly useful for the folks who don't want
+	  to use a bzImage for capturing the crash dump and want to use a
+	  vmlinux instead. vmlinux is not relocatable hence a kernel needs
+	  to be specifically compiled to run from a specific memory area
+	  (normally a reserved region) and this option comes handy.
+
+	  So if you are using bzImage for capturing the crash dump, leave
+	  the value here unchanged to 0x100000 and set CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=y.
+	  Otherwise if you plan to use vmlinux for capturing the crash dump
+	  change this value to start of the reserved region (Typically 16MB
+	  0x1000000). In other words, it can be set based on the "X" value as
+	  specified in the "crashkernel=YM@XM" command line boot parameter
+	  passed to the panic-ed kernel. Typically this parameter is set as
+	  crashkernel=64M@16M. Please take a look at
+	  Documentation/kdump/kdump.txt for more details about crash dumps.
+
+	  Usage of bzImage for capturing the crash dump is recommended as
+	  one does not have to build two kernels. Same kernel can be used
+	  as production kernel and capture kernel. Above option should have
+	  gone away after relocatable bzImage support is introduced. But it
+	  is present because there are users out there who continue to use
+	  vmlinux for dump capture. This option should go away down the
+	  line.
+
+	  Don't change this unless you know what you are doing.
