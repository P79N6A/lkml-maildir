Hi,
There has been a while since the former NTFS-TNG backport for 2.4.x
kernels was released. But is has not been dropped. Here's the next version
available. NTFS-TNG 2.0.12a is the resync with the 2.0.12 release. Yes, I
know that already NTFS 2.0.14 is available, but merging with 2.0.13 seems
painful and will take some time (Anton already explains me, how to do it;
thanks Anton :-))
The patches are available from the SourceForge project's pages:
http://linux-ntfs.sf.net/downloads.html
and
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=13956&release_id=98363
regards,
pkot
