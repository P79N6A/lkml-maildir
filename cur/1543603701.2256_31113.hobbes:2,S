A technique I used in a similar situation once went something like:
tv.tv_sec=bignum;
tv.tv_usec = 0;
enable_signals();
select(nfds, &readfds,&writefds,0,&tv);
and have the signal handlers set tv.tv_sec to 0. (tv is a global
variable).
Then if the signal comes before the select, the select exits
immediately.
