Hi Alexander.

That was my first thought and the reason why it stayed in my inbox
for so long.
But I could not find a better way to do it. We could do it in
different ways but not better.

From the commit where the seperate section were introduced:
    Introducing separate sections for __dev* (HOTPLUG),
    __cpu* (HOTPLUG_CPU) and __mem* (MEMORY_HOTPLUG)
    allows us to do a much more reliable Section mismatch
    check in modpost. We are no longer dependent on the actual
    configuration of for example HOTPLUG.
I think that explains it.
