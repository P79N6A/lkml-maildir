Well first off, i dont believe anyone has ever prooved that an fuse
filesystem on linux is inheritly much slower than the slowest filesystem
on linux, in fact i believe this to be very far from the truth, and even
if you are not able to squeeze the last bits of efficiency out, i doubt
that its gonna be the cpu overhead that will kill your IO performance.
ZFS-on-FUSE may not have all the features now, it may not ever get them,
but its far from pointless, but whats even more pointless and silly, is
you blindly acknowledging that you are uninformed and seeking
information (which is okay enough), but at the same time calls stuff
silly and unreal.
