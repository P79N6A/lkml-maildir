    Just describe it the way it works.
Yes, I did that further down the same page, describing the BSD vfork
and the reasons for it. But the POSIX description is what programmers
that wish to produce portable programs have to use. In a portable
program vfork only has disadvantages - strictly speaking it cannot be
used at all. Maybe I should add a separate LINUX DESCRIPTION.

    Andries, 
    I sent revisions to the vfork() and fork() man pages to you months ago.
Hmm, let me see.. Yes, indeed, there it is, sitting in manpages.incoming.
Must be time again to make man-pages-1.27 - the previous release was last
August. Maybe tonight. Sorry for my bad memory.
    This controversial syscall was publically and vigorously debated on
    the linux-kernel list in January of this year, prior to its inclusion
    in the 2.2 kernels.  See the archives.
I know all about it.
    The decision to implement was made with the blessing (and assistance) of 
    the keeper of the kernel himself.
You forgot the capitals.
    Considerations included performance, 
    conformance to published standards, existing implementations in Solaris, 
    HP-UX, Open/Free/NetBSD, etc, and porting of existing application code.
    IMHO, creating manual pages which argue that a syscall is evil, broken
    as designed, etc, is NOT appopriate.  We have better forums for such
    discussions.
You misread my intentions. I argue that Joe Programmer had better
avoid vfork if he hopes to write portably.
But I do not exclude the possibility that some web server becomes
0.1% faster because of it.
[Do you have numbers? People tell me that the rumour goes that
compiling BSD libc using vfork is just measurably faster.
I have not heard of any Linux results.]
    If the vfork() syscall is evil then lets reopen the public discussion and
    reach a decision to either accept it or pull it from the kernel entirely.
    Otherwise, let the man pages document its semantics/behavior, along 
    with a warning that the porting issue cuts both ways.  
Hmm. Its cuts only one way: avoid vfork in a program that should be portable.
I will replace the word `broken' in the header.
(And maybe replace the entire page - will have to see what you wrote.)
But otherwise - are not all statements below factually correct?
