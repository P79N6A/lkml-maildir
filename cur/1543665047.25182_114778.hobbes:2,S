You want the change, not me ;)
I did benchmark it some time ago (cannot share numbers sorry) and it 
didn't look like a good idea.

It should already work on the current kernel, modulo clone.
(but arch_prctl, set_thread_area in 2.5, ldt in 2.4 etc.)

It's needed for 32bit emulation at least. The code is 100% shared
between the emulation and the native 64bit model.
In theory it could be removed from the system call table for 64bit
but there didn't seem a good reason to do so - after all 64bit programs
can put their thread local data into the first 4GB and 
fast context switches.

The problem is that the 64bit base has different semantics. 
When you use a segment register you have to do:
	call kernel to set gdt/ldt
	movl index,%%fs
But when the kernel did set the 64bit base in the kernel call the
following movl to the selector would destroy it again
Loading the index inside the system call would also be problematic:
First it would be different from what i386 does, causing porting headaches.
Also you could not easily do it from a different thread unlike the 
LDT load.

That should already work and it is in fact how I imagined this to be: 
do MAP_32BIT - if yes use set_thread_area or an LDT entry;
if not use arch_prctl
The NPTL signal race problem for the clones in case you have a 64bit
base is a bit ugly though I agree.
I don't like your patch currently because it'll guarantee slow 
context switch times for 64bit.
Automatic switching based on the set bits in the base may be possible 
(in fact I had something like this in set_thread_area for some time, but 
removed it because of the ugly semantics because set_thread_area doesn't
already load the selector). If the selector load is forced
in clone however it would not be as weird, just only somewhat
ugly. You'll have to guarantee in user space then that you don't
reload it.
Real solution would be Windowish - Create clone7() with both
selectors and bases 
[I suspect 2.8 and 3.0 will get that anyways as experience
on other operating systems who started on the same path 
shows. e.g. AmigaOS grew more CreateTask
variants with more arguments with each release until they eventually
settled on passing tag lists.]
