How quickly do you see this message? Does it happen right at boot time,
or during load?

You seem to be losing lots of timer ticks. If this happens enough, the
system will fall back to the PIT thinking that your cpu frequency must
have changed w/o notification. 
You might want to try the attached patch to see if we're overreacting
when we fall back to the PIT or if your system really is having trouble.
Basically I'm just disabling the lost tick compensation code, which
means if your system is really having issues, you'll still lose time.

Also, do you see the problem when preempt is disabled (without using the
attached patch?)
thanks
