Im posting to ask the Great Penquins for some insight on a problem.
As of test 7 sb.o does not work (Mandrake system with all related
updates) if i insmod sb.o
it gives init module no such device.
The really goofy thing is with a 2.2 kernel (thank you whomever for that
multiple kernel idea) sound works
perfectly!
Cooker list has a few related problems with Creative Labs cards (mine is
a sound blaster 16 isapnp)
Robert L Martin (not on list please cc to robertlmarti@earthlink.net)
