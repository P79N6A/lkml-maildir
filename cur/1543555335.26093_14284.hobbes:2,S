Yes, current limit is 1000000 and if I/O can manage 200req/s, then it
will expire 5000 sec after. So, I said "infinite (more than 1hour)".
Why do you add extreme priotity to lower sector accesses, which breaks
elevator scheduling idea?

No, the performance down caused from this point.  Server benchmark has
a standard configuration workload which consists from several kind of
task, such as, CPU interntional, disk seq-read, seq-write, random-read,
random-write.
The benchmark invokes lots of processes, each corresponds to a client,
and each accesses different portion of few large files.  We have
enough memory to hold all dirty data at onece (1GB without himem), so
if no I/O blocking occur, all process can be run simultaneously with
limited amount of dirty flush I/O stream.
If some processes eagerly access relatively lower blocks, and other
process unfortunately requests higher block read, then the process is
blocked. Eventually this happens to large portion of processes, the
performance goes extremely down.
 During the measurement of test10 or test11, the performance is very
fluctuated and lots of idle time observed by vmstat. Such instability
is not observed on test1 or test2.
