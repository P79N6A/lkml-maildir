Agreed, I've implemented this and ripped the stats out of kstat. Patch
coming soon :-)
We do then loose the ability to tell when we've started a new request,
now we just account all buffers as a new request. Not a big deal, IMHO.
But do you just want per-queue stats, and not care about minors at all?

No big deal, for now I just have the proc code doing blk_get_queue for
every major. That code is hardly performance critical ;-)

Rigth, for IDE we'd get a per hwgroup stat. Sane for SCSI, too.
