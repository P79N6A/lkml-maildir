Hm.. ide.2.2.21.05042001-Ole.patch is just Hedrick's ide.2.2.19.05042001.patch
modified to apply cleanly to 2.2.21pre2+new via driver. Did you have this
problem before (2.2.19/2.2.20)?

Hm.. That is strange. You should ask Alan Cox. He is the maintainer of
2.2.x kernels.

Is this FUJITSU (hdi) connected to HPT? If so, the problem may be in hpt
driver. You may check some more recent version of IDE backport from
2.4.x: 
http://www.ans.pl/ide/testing
 - the latest is ide.2.2.21.01282002-Ole,
but the new version of hpt driver has not been yet backported. I'm going
to do it tomorrow.
