If anybody's interested, I can provide source-code, dated in the first
part of this decade (1991), that uses the obvious "windowing" mechanism
to set the century byte of the CMOS chip. This is used in the Analogic
2030 arbitrary function generator. I wrote the BIOS. This source-code
is proprietary, however, to support a petition against MD, it could
certainly be referenced and possibly forced into evidence if a complaint
ever went that far.
Just because a patent was issued, it does not mean it's valid. If the
patent holder is informed that your use predates his, and it becomes
obvious that there was prior art not cited in the application, the
patent holder will usually issue an "unrestricted license" so that
nobody has to show patent validity or otherwise.
Cheers,
