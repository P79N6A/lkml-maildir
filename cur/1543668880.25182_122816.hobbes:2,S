I do have Special FastTrak feature turned on as well.
I have also compiled support for IDE Raid + Promise RAID.
dmesg shows the drives at hde and hdg detected as UDMA(100).
ataraid/d0: ataraid/d0p1
Drive 0 is 43979 Mb (33 / 0)
Drive 1 is 43979 Mb (34 / 0)
Still I simply treat it as a Ultra-card and use /dev/hde and /dev/hdg in
a RAID1 config with 2 IBM 45Gb drives.
(though /dev/ataraid/d0p1 exists, something I wasn't aware I had choosen
to compile into the kernel )
"cat /proc/ide/pdc202xx"  says both masters are running UDMA4 and that
the card is an Ultra100.
hdparm -tT /dev/md5 gives;
 Timing buffer-cache reads:	128 Mb in  0.29 seconds =441.38 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:	64 Mb in  1.77 seconds = 36.16 MB/sec
Good luck!
