If you could make one more test, do the compile with -pipe set in the 
top level Makefile. I don't have play access to a HT uni, the only 
machines available to me at the moment are SMP and production at that.
I did try it just for grins on a non-HT uni and saw this:
opt		real	user	sys	idle
-j1		406.2	308.1	19.0	79.1
-j1 -pipe	398.6	308.2	19.0	71.4
-j3		391.6	308.3	19.0	64.3
-j3 -pipe	388.7	308.4	19.0	61.3
P4-2.4MHz, 256MB, compiling 2.5.47-ac6 with just "make." Using -pipe 
*may* allow both siblings to cooperate better.
I assume that CPU affinity should apply to all siblings in a package?
