Hello,
Everything was running OK with my 2.2.1-ac3 (+ Trond's patches) for
few days.
And, suddenly, I have not been able to open a new shell (executing
my .profile) without receiving a lot of following messages :
> nfs: RPC call returned error 111
> nfs_revalidate_inode: /// getattr failed, ino=151400449, error=-111
Once logged, it seems OK, but every time I have to access a file,
I get these messages. At the time of writing, the load is getting
high, and (as others already have) I can find :
> Feb 12 14:06:23 dgps6 kernel: nfs: task 13833 can't get a request slot
in the /var/log/messages file.
The NFS serveur is a Solaris 2.5.1 machine, but I do not think that
it matters.
A+
