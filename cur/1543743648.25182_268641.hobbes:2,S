And do I see any bug reports from you in GCC bugzilla?  I do not (not
under the name `Clayton Weaver', anyway).
Further, the code you provide works in all the GCC-3.x versions I've got
here.
If you don't even *report* the bug, how can you expect it to get fixed?

The preprocessor was totally rewritten between GCC-2.95.x and GCC-3.x: a
number of things that were valid in 2.95.x but invalid under ISO C were
made to not work in 3.x (for example, the compiler warns about attempts
to concatenate two things with ## that aren't preprocessing tokens, and
eventually this was made a hard error, IIRC).
This is, of course, not a bug.
I can find no mention of string concatenation bugs against the new
preprocessor relating to anything other than token pasting (and all of
those bugs are people trying to token-paste things that aren't tokens,
generally strings).

What? You found a compiler bug, so you reported it as a bug against
glibc?

... especially if the people who see the problems don't report them and
don't provide reproducible testcases.

It would be good if people would report bugs in the new compilers. :)

It is quite a bit slower :(
