hey all,
i have a problem when booting the 2.6.18.1 kernel.
namely: 
http://www.kuleuven.be/harry/kern.log
on 
http://www.kuleuven.be/harry/index.html
 you find all the info i think 
might be useful for further analysing the problem. i checked on 
#kernelnewbies , and they pointed me here...
can you please answer to my address too, since i'm not subscribed to 
lkml. (i don't know if i really need pci hotplug, but if it's a bug (and 
i think it is), it needs to be fixed, right? ;)
thanks!
