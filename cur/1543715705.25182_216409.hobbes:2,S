Particularly in network environtments the lack of locking facilities
is more than just discomfort even if root has the option of (limitted)
user level access control. But even if just local users were allowed
to use usbfs, double access could easily happen by accident, i.e., I
didn't expect
scanimage -h
to list the availlable scanners which caused the failure of usbfs in
my case. In conclusion I dare say that any effort on the development
of locking facilities for usbfs will be most likely appreciated very much.
