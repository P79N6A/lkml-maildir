I can, but that is not necessarily an "apples to apples" comparison.
When I compare with 2.4 preempt + low latency kernels, the X stress
test had > 99% of the samples within 100 usec of the nominal value.
Don't forget - on a 2.4 kernel, the IRQ's are all unthreaded. On
the 2.4 kernel, heavy disk I/O is where I get the worst behavior
and even then, I get > 90% of samples within 100 usec.
I still maintain that a 2.6 RT kernel has to do as well or better
than a 2.4 RT kernel (or else, why would I step up??).
