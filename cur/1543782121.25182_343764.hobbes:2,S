[PATCH] driver core: fix bus_rescan_devices() race.
bus_rescan_devices_helper() does not hold the dev->sem when it checks for
!dev->driver. device_attach() holds the sem, but calls again device_bind_driver()
even when dev->driver is set (which means device is already bound to a driver).
what happens is that a first device_attach() call (module insertion time) is on
the way binding the device to a driver. another thread calls bus_rescan_devices().
now when bus_rescan_devices_helper() checks for dev->driver it is still NULL 'cos
the the prior device_attach() is not yet finished. but as soon as the first one
releases the dev->sem the second device_attach() tries to rebind the already
bound device again. device_bind_driver() does this blindly which leads to a
corrupt driver->klist_devices list (the device links itself, the head points
to the device). later a call to device_release_driver() sets dev->driver to NULL
and breaks the link it has to itself on knode_driver. rmmoding the driver
later calls driver_detach() which leads to an endless loop 'cos the list head
in klist_devices still points to the device. and since dev->driver is NULL
it's stuck with the same device forever. boom. and rmmod hangs.
very easy to reproduce with new-style pcmcia and a 16bit card. just loop
modprobe <pcmcia-modules> ;cardctl eject; rmmod <card driver, pcmcia modules>.
fix is not to call device_bind_driver() in device_attach() if dev->driver is
non-NULL. this is wrong anyway since if dev->driver is set the device is bound.
also remove the dev->drv check in bus_rescan_devices_helper().
and while at it replace spin_(un|)lock_irq in driver_detach with the non-irq
variants. just doesn't make sense to me. the whole klist locking never uses the
irq variants.
