I've been thinking about this a chunk more. The embedded folks have been
having a related argument about SA_EDGE and SA_LEVEL or similar. On some
embedded platforms the driver really has to pass this information
according to the board configuration.
Trying to guess the current IRQ level v edge on a PC is very hard.
Trying to set it correctly from the driver is rather easier.
