You'd obviously want to make the PF_MEMALLOC task as tight as possible,
and running mlocked: I don't particularly see why such a task would be
any safer in-kernel.
PF_MEMALLOC tasks won't enter page reclaim at all. The only way they
will reach the writeout path is if you are write(2)ing stuff (you may
hit synch writeout).
