It will be weird to see drivers/video/ in a dmaengine pull request, but:
1/ as you point out it appears to be a free-for-all in that directory,
so Sascha's ack seems to be all that is needed here.
2/ merging the driver without any in-tree users does not make much sense
3/ these are new drivers so the risk of causing a regression should be
close to zero especially since none of the existing dmaengine users
will pick up these private channels
Can you send me the series, off-list, in a .tar.gz with Sascha's ack
to make sure I am applying the latest.  I can not seem to find [PATCH
2/4 v8] in my inbox...
Thanks,
Dan
