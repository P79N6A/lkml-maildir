I'm one of the first persons who posted to this thread, and I'm starting to 
regret that I did.
I believe Marc did the GPL\0 trick just to avoid the warnings. It was wrong to 
do it and he already apologised.
IMHO writing a more descriptive message and not issuing the tainting warning 
more than once *at all*, seems pretty harmless and would solve problems for 
everyone and we could just move on with our lifes (this thread has almost 150 
posts now!)
The only problem with reporting only once would be to have remove one module at 
a time and rebooting until untainting. In my opinion, if your system is so out 
of control that you don't know what modules are tainting it, you deserve to have 
make 3 reboots to remove 3 modules :)
Some people feel that Linuxant isn't helping the comunnity because hardware 
manufacturers won't feel obligated to release open source drivers if thay have a 
closed source alternative.
IMHO what makes manufacturers care about Linux is market share. Until we have a 
fair market share, manufacturers won't bother developing for Linux, because 
their return on this effort will be minimal.
Linuxant is in fact helping Linux geting a bigger market share.
Anyway, as everyone on this list I strongly prefer open-source drivers. Users 
prefer open-source drivers, specially if they already come with their 
distribution and just work out-of-the-box.
So if the hardware manufacturers start caring about linux (because of the 
increased market share), they will release open source drivers. Just look at the 
manufacturers that produce hardware for high-end servers (where the Linux market 
share is already very high). Network cards, RAID controllers, etc., already have 
open source drivers, because of this.
Linux is taking over, it is just a matter of time now :)
