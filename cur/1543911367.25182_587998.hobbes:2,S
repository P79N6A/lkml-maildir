FastMail (
http://fastmail.fm/
) have a tickbox in the web interface
so you can turn off line-wrapping if you need to.
Otherwise, as other people have said, use direct SMTP (we don't allow
it for non-paying accounts, but do for all levels of paying user)
and use a sane local client (in my case mutt+offlineimap)
