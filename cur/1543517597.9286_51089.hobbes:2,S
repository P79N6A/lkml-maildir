I'd swear my Toshiba Portege 7020 does this on unshifted keys too, but
of course I can't get it to happen when I want it to...

I was pretty suprised that there wasn't any debounce code already in
the keyboard driver. I would have thought that other keyboard controllers
would exhibit this once very common problem. There is some debounce handling
in drivers/char/pc110pad.c though.
