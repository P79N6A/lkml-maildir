Now that part is interesting from the how to sell it to non-Linux users
POV, but not for the linux kernel.

Here comes the problem.  All the access checking/race avoidance/loop
creation avoiced, in short the posix+extension semantics are implemented
in the Linux VFS layer.  If you want to allow a second access method
(e.g. Hans' pet syscall) you'd have to duplicate all VFS functioanlity
inside reiser4.  But this is absolutely not what we want, because we
moved to this common as all previous version in the different
filesystems were buggy, and in fact there are problems that are simply
not solveable at the level at all (rename on directories comes to mind).
So if you want to provide an additional API you'll have to go through
the VFS to get it right - ergo a plugin architecture for upper plugins
is worthless.
Plugins for the disk-format level are an interesting and workable idea
on the other hand.
