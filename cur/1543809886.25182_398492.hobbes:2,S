Fair enough.
What do you think of these changes?
From: Andrew Morton <akpm@osdl.org>
- Nuke the blank line between "}" and EXPORT_SYMBOL().  That's never seemed
  pointful to me.
- Make the get_max_files export use _GPL - only unix.ko uses it.
- Use `-1' in the arg to percpu_counter_mod() rather than `-1L'.  The
  compiler will dtrt and we shouldn't be peering inside percpu_counter
  internals here anyway.
- Scrub that - use percpu_counter_dec() and percpu_counter_inc().
- percpu_counters can be inaccurate on big SMP.  Before we actually fail a
  get_empty_filp() attempt, use the (new in -mm) expensive
  percpu_counter_sum() to check whether we're really over the limit.
- Make get_nr_files() static.  Which is just as well - any callers might
  want the percpu_counter_sum() treatment.  In which case we'd be better off
  exporting some
	bool are_files_over_limit(how_many_i_want);
  API.
