Then, this is currently broken in all cases
and needs to be fixed since the CPM/CPM2
could have up to six UART ports.

I don't think that would be a problem, and I'd like the
CPM/QE to share devices because it makes the
software distributions common to all Freescale
embedded processors.

That would be bad.  It has nothing to do with the
kernel, but we have finally survived the distribution
updates to ttyCPM, and I don't want to go through
that again just because of QE.
Thanks.
