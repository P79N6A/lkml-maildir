If I'm reading it right, yes.
If for vservers the fundamental unit of res mgmt is a vserver, that can
surely be done at a higher level than in the kernel.
Actually, these could be tied just by doing
	mount -t container -o ns,cpuset /containers
So now any task in /containers/vserver1 or any subdirectory thereof
would have the same cpuset constraints as /containers.  OTOH, you could
mount them separately
	mount -t container -o ns /nsproxy
	mount -t container -o cpuset /cpuset
and now you have the freedom to split tasks in the same vserver
(under /nsproxy/vserver1) into different cpusets.
