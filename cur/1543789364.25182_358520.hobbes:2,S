This is 64bit ... only low memory.

The pages are all low, just at the wrong end of the memory.

First this problem is definitely not critical. AFAIK it only happens on 
scalex's unreleased machines. Intel NUMA x86 machines are really rare
and on AMD it doesn't happen because the swiotlb is not used there.
So just ignoring it is a quite reasonable option.
Both NODE(0) and node_online_map are risky. NODE(0) may break IA64
(they share this code) and node_online_map may break one of the weirder
ARM platforms again (for which the original revert was done)
For 2.6.14 I think it's best to ignore it and use node_online_map for 2.6.15.
