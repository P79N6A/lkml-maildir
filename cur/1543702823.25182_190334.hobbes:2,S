	just because it passes tests of entropy and probability doesn't make it 
random. it just gets really really close. [hence pseudo-random]
Everybody knows that /dev/random isn't truly random (it's still a state 
machine, dependent on a hash algorithm [chosen b/c they can take a 
non-random source and make it 'LOOK' random], and you feed it with data 
that is not totally predictable. BUT, there are still enough ways to 
exploit it if you can control/influence the input). it just can pass 
enough tests so that it can be used.
	and that still doesn't answer the question of how one would use [such a 
device] to 'generate a one time pad'. a one time pad must be possessed by 
both parties that are communicating. and if you have a secure channel to 
transmit an OTP, then you have one that can carry a message as well (most 
commonly, an OTP is used with a time delay. there is a single time when a 
secure channel is available. one [or both] of the parties brings it with 
him/her when he/she travels.
	so i'd believe that mebbe this Securikey could hold one... but, any USB 
key-fob type device can.
	I'm sure that someone else can be more knowledgeable on this than I, but 
the general theory holds fast.

optimist, n.:
	A proponent of the belief that black is white.
	A pessimist asked God for relief.
	"Ah, you wish me to restore your hope and cheerfulness," said God.
	"No," replied the petitioner, "I wish you to create something that
would justify them."
	"The world is all created," said God, "but you have overlooked
something -- the mortality of the optimist."
