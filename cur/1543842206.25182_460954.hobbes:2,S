That's fine. I agree with the idea - *but* it strikes me that we don't
really have a co-ordinated database of what module "patterns" map to
what on-disk firmware, aside from hotplug/udev scripts. We need to
co-ordinate this stuff a lot more. Or am I missing something? I'm happy
to setup a database on the kerneltools.org wiki if that's useful...

the Fedora space - and some of you won't like me for it :P Basically I
want to put a GUI in front of DKMS/kmods/other module packaging/firmware
update utilities and automatically locate/build/install third-party GPL
(but not yet upstream) drivers on non-moving target distros. Evil stuff
like that also would find knowing about external firmware useful. ]

The reasoning behind MODULE_FIRMWARE is because firmware names can be
dynamically generated in the module so we can't know what it's going to
need ahead of time. I'd like to hook this up with the PCI ID/etc. of the
hardware that needs that firmware - so we really only package the
mimimum, but I think that's overkill.

I'm trying to avoid the need to have lots of different places in
userland needing to track firmware versioning. But on some level, I just
need to know that a given driver is going to ask for 1 firmware with the
ID of "foo" - and a way to extrapolate where it is on disk to package.
