That must be it then. I know that one of our stacks was taken from BSD,
(and I know it made it into the main line for at least a little while),
but as I said in my original email (which portion you deleted), I'm
unsure which of our IP stacks was taken from them.

The national budget must be balanced. The public debt must be reduced; the
arrogance of the authorities must be moderated and controlled. Payments to
foreign governments must be reduced, if the nation doesn't want to go
bankrupt. People must again learn to work, instead of living on public
assistance.                                    Marcus Tullius Cicero, 55 BC
