"file" can go away if you do not call "get_file()" before releasing the
locking.

You are right, this can lock-up. Swapper is only protected from
reentrancy on it's own stack, not from reentrancy from another thread.

The result is not a rare lock-up, but it will lock-up nearly
immediately. Even Joe would notice that.

Or: use a multiple reader - single writer semaphore with "starve writer"
policy.
IMO that's cleaner than a semaphore with an attached waitqueue for
do_munmap().

Ok.
