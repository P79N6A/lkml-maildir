Lets say you have two locks X and Y.  Y nests inside of X. To do block1
you need to have lock Y and to do block2 you need to have both locks X
and Y, and block 1 must be done first without holding lock X.
func()
{
again:
	mutex_lock(Y);
	block1();
	if (!mutex_try_lock(X)) {
		mutex_unlock(Y);
		mutex_lock(X);
		mutex_lock(Y);
		if (block1_has_changed()) {
			mutex_unlock(Y);
			mutex_unlock(X);
			goto again;
		}
	}
	block2();
	mutex_unlock(X);
	mutex_unlock(Y);
}
Stuff like the above actually is done (it's done in the kernel). So you
can see here that Y can be released and reacquired right away.  If
another task was waiting on Y (of lower priority) we don't want to give
up the lock, since we would then block and the chances of
block1_has_changed goes up even more.

I'm not sure what Nick means here, but I'm sure he didn't mean it to
come out that way ;)

But you can't know if a higher or lower priority process is waiting.
Sure it works like what you say when a higher priority process is
waiting, but it doesn't when it's a lower priority process waiting.
