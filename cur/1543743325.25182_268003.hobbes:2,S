Also a kernel newbie here, so apply appropriate amount of salt to
response. :)
One common scenario for why a program is blocked within a syscall is
that it is waiting for data to arrive. Consider, for example, a read()
on a file -- simplifying a lot, the data has to be fetched from disk,
which is slow. So, while the disk is doing it's thing, the program is
blocked within the system call. Then, when an interrupt arrives
signalling that the data is ready, it is placed into the user-space
buffer, and the program is kicked out of the syscall so that it can
continue executing.
Consider what happens if the program suddenly dies within the read()
syscall above: when the data from disk comes back, the kernel needs to
figure out where to put it. This would make for a very confused kernel,
since the original requester "vanished" without a trace. Even worse,
another program might have taken the original program's place in the
meantime! Very bad things happen.
This is certainly not an _impossible_ problem to solve (as far as I
know), but solving it in the general case would involve a lot of
expensive and complex book-keeping code, so it's simply not done.
Am I right? Wrong? Please enlighten me as well. :)
