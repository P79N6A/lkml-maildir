do you prefer separate mails with patch and with reference to original

ok, here goes some more descriptions:
1.
proc_readdir is a sleeping ops:
sys_getdents
`- vfs_readdir
      `- proc_readdir
           `- filldir
                `- put_user/copy_to_user
that's why we must use semaphore. of course spinlock can be used too,
but this will case another problem: it must be dropped to call filldir, but
beofre it will be retaken the dentry being filldir-ed may be removed and
we won't see it's siblings in output.
2.
lock_kernel() is needed to handle at least simultaneous sys_read vs
create_proc_entry with sequental de->proc_fops = XXX. this can be
handled by passing fops directly to create_proc_entry.
i.e. there is a 3rd problem I pointed to you before:
create_proc_entry() and setting of de->owner/de->proc_fops is inatomic.
lock_kernel() is not a best way to protect against this, sure...
I would prefer to fix it with a separate patch somehow...
3.
refcounting:
each proc_dir_entry's refcounter is the reference from inode plus
references from children. once this count reaches zero - dentry is freed.
so on each proc_register() parent is get-ed, on each remove_proc_entry
parent is put-ed.
