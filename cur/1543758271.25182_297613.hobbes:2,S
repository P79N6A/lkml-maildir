I don't mind.

The default fdisk will assign type 83 to a newly created partition.
One has to change it by hand to 0. So, I do not think testing against 0
is so bad. A heuristic, You give another heuristic. Probably there will
be a point in time where we need both.
(About type 0: DOS has used type 0 as definition of unused. It is not
bad if Linux uses DOS-conventions for a DOS-type partition table.)
