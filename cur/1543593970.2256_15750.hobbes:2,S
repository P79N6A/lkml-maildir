Fix in quirks.c (quirk_vialatency() function) didn't work on my ABIT KT7A 
motherboard (with 686b southbridge) with BIOS version WV.  
(see 
http://www.abit.com.tw/english/download/bios
%20update/bios-kt7a.htm)
In that case fix should be commented off. 
After upgrade to the latest (ZT) version of BIOS, fix in quirks.c works. Well,
works, it makes no problem to the soundcard, I'm not sure whether is needed
as options can be set up in BIOS directly.

I was not able to find your address on 
http://lists.kernelnotes.de/linux-kernel
and home@cpbotha.net was one of two addresses I have found on your webpage.
