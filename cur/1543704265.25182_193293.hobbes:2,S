Hi!
You wanted to test me that swsusp still works in Linux
2.6.2-rc1-mm1. It does. (There are some console warnings, but their
absence in 2.6.2-rc1 is only bcause it does not warn about such stuff,
AFAIC). Please push swsusp changes into 2.6.2. 
							Pavel
PS: In both 2.6.2-rc1 and  2.6.2-rc1-mm1, machine does not power down
after finishing save-to-disk. I'll take a look what is going on.
