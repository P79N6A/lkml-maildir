The 1st patch re-writes direct-io to handle non-512 aligned
addresses.  Without the 2nd patch, it will never see non-512
aligned user address and should work the same as before only
with slightly smaller code :).  The drivers will get the
same 512-byte aligned addresses.  Am I missing something?

The code still does zero out the 1st portion.  dio_zero_block()
is being called twice still.  Sure looks like it is working to
me:
Test program d.c:
------------------------
#define _GNU_SOURCE     1
                                                                                
                                                                                
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <string.h>
main()
{
	int fd;
	char *buf;
	int io_size = 512;
	off_t skip = 512;
	int i;
	if (posix_memalign((void *)&buf, getpagesize(), io_size) != 0) {
		perror("cannot alloc mem");
		exit(1);
	}
	memset(buf, 'a', io_size);
	
	fd = open("direct_test_file", O_RDWR|O_DIRECT|O_TRUNC|O_CREAT, 0666);
	lseek(fd, skip, SEEK_SET);
	if ((i = write(fd, buf, io_size)) != io_size) {
		perror("bad write");
		exit(2);
	}
	
	printf("write to direct_test_file %d bytes of 'a' at %d\n", i, skip);
	memset(buf, 'b', io_size);
	lseek(fd, getpagesize(), SEEK_SET);
	if ((i = write(fd, buf, io_size)) != io_size) {
		perror("bad write");
		exit(2);
	}
	printf("write to direct_test_file %d bytes of 'b' at %d\n", i, getpagesize());
}
--------------------------
$ ./d
write to direct_test_file 512 bytes of 'a' at 512
write to direct_test_file 512 bytes of 'b' at 4096
$ hexdump direct_test_file
0000000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
*
0000200 6161 6161 6161 6161 6161 6161 6161 6161

The 1st 512 bytes are zeroed as well as the bytes between
1k and 4k.
Thanks,
Daniel
