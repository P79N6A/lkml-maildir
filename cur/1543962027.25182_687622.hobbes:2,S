Why is Dmitry responsible for a bug introduced by a commit *you* 
Signed-off in a subsystem that lists *you* as the maintainer?
The bug is in arch/x86/Kconfig .
Caused by commit 4cf31841762954ad2868156ccba94d798a16630f
(x86: mach-rdc321x Kconfig fix).
That Dmitrys code broke was just a side effect of your bug.
Roman's patch to remove the need to select NEW_LEDS that just appeared 
in another thread will actually also fix your bug (and makes my idea 
to add a "select NEW_LEDS" to X86_RDC321X obsolete).
