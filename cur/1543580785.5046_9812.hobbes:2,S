Agreed. Point was when I discovered the broken BAR location the BIOS had
set, it was at late 2.4.0-test12. So I prefered a simple fix in the yenta
driver without touching other stuff like PCI, just in case Linus would
have liked it for 2.4.

Sorry, wasn't clear enough. I've meant, the kernel (PCI stuff) changing
the BAR bus address in the config space when enabling the device (i.e.
the bus address value which is used for later mapping). Doing so would
make the pci_resource_start() value bogus (when obtained before enabling
the device) - even without accessing/ioremap() it.
My guess is this might happen, but I'm not sure when. Probably if our PCI
stuff assigned another BAR without inital bus address to overlap with
what the BIOS suggested for some initially disabled BAR. Or for real PCI
hotplugging in general.
Just to understand it's more than a cosmetical bug if a driver saves this
before the device is up...
