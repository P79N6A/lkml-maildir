You have a few options.  Considering your program can't run as root,
that means directly using setrlimit (or smth like ulimit in bash) is
probably not right for you.  Take a look at the pam docs for
/etc/security/limits.conf, specifically for memlock.

I have no idea what your kernel module is, nor what your exact
requirements are.  However, you shouldn't be changing rlimits in a
kernel module, there's plenty of userspace support for that.
