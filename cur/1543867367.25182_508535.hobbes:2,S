Learning from the past, I think a good comparison would be the support
for several block IO schedulers (e.g. deadline, cfq, anticipatory, etc).
The added flexibility of a pluggable architecture allowed for a lot of
innovation and experimentation that might not have happened otherwise.
There even is a "noop" scheduler that makes sense for some hardware
devices but not others.  In short, Linux processor idle power management
support needs some growing room to find its "ondemand" equivalent.
In my opinion, the best sort of a tunable would be a variable that
indicates userspace's intentions to the cpuidle governor.  Maybe
something to the effect of the following...
- Maximum Performance
- Balanced (attempt to do well in both)
- Maximum Battery-life
Of course governors can have their own specific tunables, but it would
probably be best to not touch them in the typical use-case.
Thanks,
Adam
