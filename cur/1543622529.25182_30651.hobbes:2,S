Subject: New version (2.4.18.1) of AMD Elan patch
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

A new version of the AMD Elan patch is available on
  
http://www.pengutronix.de/software/elan_en.html
This is a maintainance version only, no new functionality has been added.
The patch against 2.4.18.1 deals with the following stuff:
- serial driver bugfix (was sent to Theodore Ts'o and rmk)
- correct ioport resource reservation for /proc/ioport
If you have an AMD Elan processor (SC400, SC410, SC520) please test this
fix extensively and send me bug reports. You might also want to test it if
you don't have this special hardware, as the patch now does also affect
the normal serial driver.
Robert
