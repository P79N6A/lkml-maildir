Yes, by plugging the sk_wake_async() that is called from std ->data_ready
and ->write_space of generic socket support, all sockets types are
supported. Well, I should say "should" instead of "are" because I never
tested it with sockets different from TCP/IP :)

This can be certainly implemented if many of you feel that it could be
usefull. The clean way to understand if a file* is of a given type would
be to make the "struct file_operations" of the compatible files ( sockets
and pipes ) to be non-static and to use something like :
if (f->f_op == ...)
to test the target file type. I'm already doing this to verify the epoll
file descriptor coherence.

IMHO sys_epoll is going to be a replacement for rt-signals, because it
scales better, it collapses events and does not have the overflowing queue
problem.

The sys_epoll interface was coded to use the existing infrastructure w/out
adding any legacy code added to suite the implementation. Basically,
besides the few lines added to fs/pipe.c to support pipes ( rt-signal did
not support them ), the hook lays inside sk_wake_async().
