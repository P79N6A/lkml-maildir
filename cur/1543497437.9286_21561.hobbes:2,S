I agree that XFS would most likely be compiled in rather than as a module (much
more convenient for an xfs root fs), but there is still the case of a dual boot
machine where you might prefer to only mount the local Irix partition via the
automounter to avoid having xfs.o loaded when you don't use it.
Although you'd argue that as opposed to WinXX, it is very likely that you'd
want to share the /home area between Irix and Linux so that the XFS volume
would always be mounted anyway.

My understanding from the announcement is that the main/only missing piece will
be the real-time features (Guaranteed-Rate I/O) which IIRC don't come with the
standard Irix license anyway.
