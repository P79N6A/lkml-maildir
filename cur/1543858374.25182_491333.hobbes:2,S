I suspect it's a false optimisation.
int kref_put(struct kref *kref, void (*release)(struct kref *kref))
{
	WARN_ON(release == NULL);
	WARN_ON(release == (void (*)(struct kref *))kfree);
	/*
	 * if current count is one, we are the last user and can release object
	 * right now, avoiding an atomic operation on 'refcount'
	 */
 	if ((atomic_read(&kref->refcount) == 1) ||
	    (atomic_dec_and_test(&kref->refcount))) {
		release(kref);
		return 1;
	}
	return 0;
}
The only time we avoid the atomic_dec_and_test() is when the object is
about to be freed.  ie: once in its entire lifetime.  And freeing the
object is part of an expensive (and rare) operation anyway.
otoh, we've gone and added a test-n-branch to the common case: those cases
where the object will not be freed.
