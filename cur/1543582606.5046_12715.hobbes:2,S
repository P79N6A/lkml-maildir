Hi,
Is there a bug in multicast IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP that
when you try to join a multicast group on a certain
interface(the wildcard or unspecified interface), it
will return with "no such device"? 
I am using redhat 6.1. 
If there is a bug, is it fixed? what is the patch
number i should apply?
Thanks
Yingxian
