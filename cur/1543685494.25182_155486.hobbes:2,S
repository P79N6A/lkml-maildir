Subject: no exec after kernel bootup on Elan

I have kernel 2.4.21 on a Soekris net4521 (Elan SC520), and after the kernel
finishes booting up, (when it's supposed to exec init or whatever program I
specify), nothing happens, I get no output past the line "Freeing unused
kernel memory: 120k free".
I get the same results with any program I specify, whether static and
dynamically compiled.
