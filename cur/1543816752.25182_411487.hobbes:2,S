Saying that the problem is between 2.6.15.6 and 2.6.16 is rather
meaningless because you're effectively omitting _all_ the development
work between 2.6.15 to 2.6.16, and that's likely where the problem
lies.  Hence, you're omitting all the 2.6.16-rc kernels from your
testing.

I have no ideas at the moment.
