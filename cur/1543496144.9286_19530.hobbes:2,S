Hello-
    I am currently trying to implement a program which requires LLC-layer communications
with an external device.  Specifically, I need to be able to communicate using SAP 4 protocol
over a token ring network.  The program is written in C on a Redhat 5.2 machine running
kernel 2.0.36.
What I need to know is if there is a way to do LLC-layer, SAP4 level communications under
linux?  If so, is this acheivable via tcp/ip sockets, or is there another C api/library functions
that can be utilized?  If any of you know, or can point me to resources that will allow me to
find out, I would greatly appreciate it.
Thanks.
