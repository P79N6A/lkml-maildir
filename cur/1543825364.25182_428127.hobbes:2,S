I feel like I must say this: there are some file systems that live
outside the kernel (at least for now) that do _NOT_ use the default
sync_page. All the stackable file systems that are based on FiST [1],
such as Unionfs [2] and eCryptfs (currently in -mm) [3] (respective
authors CC'd). As an example, Unionfs must decide which lower file
system page to sync (since it may have several to chose from).
