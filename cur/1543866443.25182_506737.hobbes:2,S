I just want to avoid that s390 has different semantics for
smp_call_functiom*() than any other architecture. But then again it
will probably not hurt since we allow more.
Another thing that comes into my mind is smp_call_function together
with cpu hotplug. Who is responsible that preemption and with that
cpu hotplug is disabled?
Is it the caller or smp_call_function itself?
If it's smp_call_function then s390 would be broken, since
then we would have
int cpus = num_online_cpus()-1;
in preemptible context... I agree: what a mess :)
