Nope.  We're guaranteed that the pages which pagevec_lookup() returned are
a) at or beyond `start' and
b) in ascending pgoff_t order, although not necessarily contiguous. 
   There will be gaps for not-present pages.  It's just an in-order gather.
So we need the `page->index > end' test to cope with the situation where a
request for three pages returned the three pages at indices 10, 11 and
3,000,000.

Yes, good point.  That page should go away once we drop our ref, and
it's not in the radix tree any more.

Good point.  Let's make it explicit?

heh, OK.
