Sigh. The generic dma_* stuff wasn't a well thought-out idea,
and it's too late to change it in 2.6. :-(
Right now calling dma_* functions for non-busmaster devices
just *doesn't work*.

That test is not a test at all - it's precise equivalent
of "if (1)" on i386. On other platforms it's just a BUG().
I'd suggest following (untested) patch.
Ivan.
