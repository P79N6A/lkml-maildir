Yes, it would be nice if we had some better guesses on whether to think
the 80-wire cable is present. It would also be nice if the ide0=ata66
implied ignoring the byte93 data as well as the controller data, instead
of having two options for that.
Btw, reading the ATA/ATAPI-6 specs I think UDMA66 should work on a
setup where would be just one drive and a really short, 40-wire cable
without problems as well. I've even seen systems shipped like that.
