Hi,
sorry, if this has been asked before, but I could not find any in the
archives.
I have a Gigabyte GA7DXR with a onboard Promise PDC20265 IDE-Controller.
Attached to this Controller are 4 Maxtor 120 GB Disks.
Booting with 2.4.18 works fine. The partitons of the disk are detecded,
and I can access them.
Booting with 2.4.19-rc1 hangs on bootup.
The Promise is detected correctly.
But when it comes to the partition-check the systems hangs:
looks like this:

And here it hangs
Because the patch between 2.4.18 and 2.4.19-rc1 is very big, there seem
to be a lot of changes.
Thanks in andvance for any help.....
