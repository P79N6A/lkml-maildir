After about 9 days of uptime, our Alpha (164sx) had a very odd memory
problem.  
The entire machine went to a hault, and before it "locked" it spit out some
ugly
messages:
xcalloc: allocation error, size = 392
xrealloc: realloc(1280) failedCannot allocate memory
machine:#> free
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
This was on 2.2.5+ac5 + a TCP patch to fix a socket leak.  Was there a bug
in this older kernel that could cause something like this?  If so I would
like to know what it was so I can put it in the machine's notes, if not has
anyone seen any problem like this?
