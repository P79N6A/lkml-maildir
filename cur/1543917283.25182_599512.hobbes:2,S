This a series of 2 patches that should be applied on top of the other ipc
patches, in 2.6.23-rc6-mm1.
The first one is an answer to the following issue pointed out by Jarek:

The second one is a trivial patch that removes an unneeded parameter for
2 routines.
They should be applied to 2.6.23-rc6-mm1, in the following order:
[PATCH 1/2]: ipc_fix_idr_find_locking.patch
[PATCH 2/2]: ipc_remove_unneeded_params.patch

Nadia
