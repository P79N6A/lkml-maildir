Patch below clarifies comments in Documentation/pci.txt.
Greg, can you apply?
(feel free to edit it a bit more)

+Generic flavors of pci_request_region() are request_mem_region()
+(for MMIO ranges) and request_region() (for IO Port ranges).

    All interrupt handlers should be registered with SA_SHIRQ and use the devid
 to map IRQs to devices (remember that all PCI interrupts are shared).
