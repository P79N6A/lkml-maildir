OK, I've implemented adding the write_lock, but I still have a nasty
race condition, and I finally figured out why!
The damn BKL!  Here's the situation I'm having.
Process A grabs BKL then tries to grab another semaphore (say sem X)
But process B has sem X so process A sleeps.
Since semaphores don't have the restriction of saving the BKL, the BKL
   gets released from process A.
Process C comes along and grabs the BKL.
Finally B releases sem X and process A becomes the new "pending owner" 
  and wakes up.
When A schedules in it tries to grab the BKL but blocks. Now it is at
  the point where A doesn't actually own either the BKL or sem X. 
When C releases the BKL and gives it to A, A is now the pending owner
  of both the BKL and sem X.
When this occurs, all hell breaks loose. 
I believe I can solve this by making the BKL a special case and not
implement the pending owner at all for it.

Heck, I'll make it bloat city till I get it working, and then tone it
down a little :-)  And maybe later we can have a better solution for the
BKL.
