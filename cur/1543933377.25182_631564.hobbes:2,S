Allright, I d/l the spec and you are right... 
Yet another massive Intel f*ckup in the definition of PCI... Argh.
So that means you can't automatically detect that there's potentially
stuff in the extended caps. You still can do the initial probe solely
with type1, that would work around the problem with MMCONFIG overlapping
sized BARs (ah, BAR sizing, yet another case where somebody at Intel
should rather have broken an arm that day).
I still don't believe much in the idea of drivers enabling MMCONFIG
though.
