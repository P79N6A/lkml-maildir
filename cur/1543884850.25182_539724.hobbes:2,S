Adding Christoph Lameter <clameter@sgi.com> to the cc list, as he knows
more about hugetlb pages than I do.
This patch strikes me as a bit odd.
Granted, it's solving what could be a touchy problem with a fairly
simple solution, which is usually a Good Thing(tm).
However, the idea that different tasks would see different values for
the following fields in /proc/meminfo:
	HugePages_Total:     0
	HugePages_Free:      0
strikes me as odd, and risky.  I would have thought that usually, all
tasks in the system should see the same values in the files in /proc
(as opposed to the files in particular task subdirectories /proc/<pid>.)
This patch strikes me as a bit of a hack, good for compatibility, but
hiding a booby trap that will bite some user code in the long run.
But I'm not enough of an expert to know what the right tradeoffs are
in this matter.
