   this would be pretty easy if one simply decided on a maximum number
   of atm devices to have in a system.  scanning the list of adapters
   would just involve atm_dev_lookup(itf num).
I don't understand why a fixed number of ATM devs is
required in order to keep all of the device list and locking
stuff in one place.
