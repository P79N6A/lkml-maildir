I can't immediately think of any way of doing that.
One could perhaps hide it with
#ifdef CONFIG_ZEN
#define __free_pages_ok xen_free_page
#else
#define __free_pages_ok everybody_else_free_page
#endif
and rename __free_pages_ok() to everybody_else_free_page().
But heck - why bother?  The current patch adds just one line of code in one
place, and the compiler will toss it away anyway for all but xen and um.
I think we can live with that.
