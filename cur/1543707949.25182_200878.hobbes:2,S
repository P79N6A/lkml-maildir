This probably occurs because starting X caused AGP to be initialised,
which caused an interrupt on IRQ11.  Since the cardbus bridge is also
using IRQ11 to report status changes, we notice the status change.
So, the reason this went wrong _appears_ to be because we never received
the interrupt from the cardbus bridge, although the cardbus status
correctly indicated there was work to be done.
Also, you seem to have some proprietary modules loaded - have you tried
running without these modules loaded?  (See below.)

This seems to be a closed source modem driver, which seems to be using
IRQ11.  This is definitely one thing to try removing and seeing if the
problem goes away.  (By "removing" here I mean _never_ having been
loaded since boot - any other type of "removing" will not give the
desired test conditions required to correctly isolate the problem.)
