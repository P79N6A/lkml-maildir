Well, that sounds like a distro problem then, not a kernel or udev one :)

True, so sit and spin and sleep until you see the device node.  That's
how a number of distros have fixed the fsck startup issue.

Well, it needs to go that way, as the kernel moves toward not providing
the device node right when modprobe returns with the advent of
multi-threading device discovery and such.  That's why the /etc/dev.d
heirachy was created, it's not dependant on udev to provide such a
solution.  I suggest that distros that do not use udev (of which Debian
is slowly becoming a miniority) create a tool that causes /etc/dev.d
events for a static /dev tree.
