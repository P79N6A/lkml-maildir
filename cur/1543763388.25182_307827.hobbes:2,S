Hi Andrew,
As the discussion in this thread of the past few days showed, this
patch intends to take care of process grouping, but not the
accounting data collection. Besides my concern of possibility of
data loss, this patch also provides CSA information to handle process
grouping as it intends to do. I plan to run some testing to see percentage
of data loss when system is under stress test, but improvement at
CBUS as Evgeniy indicated should help!
Please be advised that i still need an do_exit handling to save accounting
data. But, it is a separate issue.
Thanks,
 - jay
