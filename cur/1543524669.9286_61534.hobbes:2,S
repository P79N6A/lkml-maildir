On Sun's with hme I use ethtool:
/usr/sbin/ethtool -s eth0 autoneg off
/usr/sbin/ethtool -s eth0 speed 100 duplex full
I've had plenty of cases where hme's to switching hubs exhibit the same
behavior you descibe, both Solaris and Linux. The hub and the hme must
both me locked down at specific duplex/speed.
