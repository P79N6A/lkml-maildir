We sell a make of flashdisk (what we call your 'usb bar') that use
sector 0 with its encryption scheme.  Basically as soon as you
'encrypt' or 'password protect' or whatever the device, you cannot
get a valid partition table, and sector 0 is not writable, so
repartitioning fails.  I have not tried to just put a fs on the
whole disk, but I assume it will fail as well, as it should start
at sector 0.
Anyhow, the only way to fix this if you lost the password, is to
format the device with the software that comes with the device
(windows based only for ours) - might be the same thing your side,
you just got the device into  'lock down mode' via some fluke.
Hope this might be of some help, else take it back.  Our side
at least if not burned or damaged, we would replace it.
