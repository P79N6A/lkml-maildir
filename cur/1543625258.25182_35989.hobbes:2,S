The data sent/received on the network is precious. You will not have
any 'extra' data on its end except for possibly a single byte if the
data didn't have an even length. Note that these things are checksummed
and also CRCed in the hardware.
If you got part of somebody's email, I think you should look at
the `tcpdump` source. It may be the culprit...
