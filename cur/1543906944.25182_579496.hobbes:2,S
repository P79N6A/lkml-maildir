Subject: Possible bug in realtek 8169 ethernet driver
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Hello,
On my system running linux kernel 2.6.21.5, I can't get my ethernet card
to work. When loading the r8169 module, it will claim to be detected as
eth0, but it will show up as eth2 in ifconfig. There are no eth0 or eth1
devices though. It doesn't work as eth2 either. 
The router attached to it indicates a 100mbit link. But that's about it.
I cannot get any data over it. I can manually configure it to have an IP
address and netmask, but it won't see anything on the local net. DHCP
doesn't work either. Nothing out of the ordinary is logged in dmesg or
anywhere else. An usb ethernet dongle on the system works just fine,
ruling out (absent anyway) firewall or similar trouble.  The device works
well in windows XP.
Relevant system specs:
-Gigabyte GA-G33m-DS2R motherboard, with the integrated realtec nic
-intel c2d CPU
I've included output of several programs below, hope this helps.
Please CC: to my email address, as I have not subscribed myself to the kernel list.
