I.e. do you want that generic event handling mechanism would not work on
x86_64? I doubt you do.

kqueue just can not be used as is in Linux (_maybe_ *bsd has different
types, not those which I found in /usr/include in my FC5 and Debian
distro). It will not work on x86_64 for example. Some kind of a pointer
or unsigned long in structures which are transferred between kernelspace
and userspace is so much questionable, than it is much better even do
not see there... (if I would not have so political correctness, I would
describe it in a much different words actually).
So, kqueue API and structures can not be usd in Linux.
