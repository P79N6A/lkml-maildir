I believe you need to change in your grub.conf file the root=/dev/hda3 
to a root=### ie root=0307
The number is composed of 3 pieces
(a) major device number ie. 3 above (leading zero is ignored)
(b) minor device number ie. 0 above
(c) partition on device ie. 7 above
I use hdb. hda and hdb are both major device number 3
hda is minor device number 0
hdb is minor device number 64
BUT minor device number is in base 16
so in base 16, hda is 0 (0x16=0) and hdb is 4 (4x16=64)
THUS
my root=/dev/hdb4 becomes root=344 (ie. maj device 3, minor device 64 
(4x16) and partition #4.
Examples:
hda1 = 301
hda3 = 303
hdb1 = 341
hdb4 = 344 etc.
Pardon if this is obvious. To determine linux device numbers, google. 
there's a list out there. I found a list below:
