NAK.
Zero means "no interrupt" in the Linux space. If you have a physical IRQ
0 remap it to a convenient number (eg map IRQ's + 1, or stick it on the
end). The logical and physical IRQ numbering in Linux don't have to match
up - and given some platforms have IRQ numbering per bus and the like
clearly doesn't in many cases.
