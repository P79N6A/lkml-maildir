It can't be. The only CPU(s) that would know anything about it and
thus be able to use that RAM are running the operating system.
It is quite obviously a BAD BIOS that doesn't follow the rules about
reporting RAM so some is wasted --- or you have 4GB on the main-board
so some gets wasted to make room for the address-space necessary for
your PCI and AGP cards.
