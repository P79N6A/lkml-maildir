It breaks Path MTU Discovery. If you have a link somewhere in your
network (not at an endpoint, or TCP MSS will take care of it) that
has an MTU < 1500, you cannot reach hotmail and a lot of other sites
either currently. It _does_ break essential things. Daily. I would
get a lot of joy from flogging all firewall admins who block all ICMP.
