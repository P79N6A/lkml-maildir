I have two issues with CIPSO and Smack:
1-
Using default configuration (system startup script + smacfs fstab line), system
can't access any service outside the Lan. "ICMP parameter problem message" always
appear from the first Wan router (traceroute + tcpdump at [1]).
Services inside the LAN can be accessed normally. System can connect to a Lan
Windows share. It also connects to the gateway HTTP server easily.
After some tweaking, I discovered that using CIPSOv6 solves all above problems:
$ echo -n "NLBL_CIPSOv6" > /smack/nltype
Is this a normal behaviour ?

Default conf let the ambient attribute = _ which works fine. Setting ambient = *
stops all external (non lo) network traffic. Did I miss another use of "ambient"
or this is a normal behaviour ?.

Although using smackfsdef=* as a mount option, all my system files have the floor
attribute. Most of the /dev files have the * attribute though.
