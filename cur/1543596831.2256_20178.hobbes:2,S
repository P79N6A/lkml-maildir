Urk!  Yeah, removing the only thing in the world keeping ramfs/tmpfs
page pegged was kinda.. dumb.  I'd ask for a browm paper baggie, but
my pointy head might damage it ;-)

_Anyway_, tmpfs is growing and growing from stdout.  If I send
output to /dev/null, no growth.  Nothing in tmpfs is growing, so I
presume the memory is disappearing down one of X or KDE's sockets.
No such leakage without tmpfs, and I can do all kinds of normal
file type use of tmpfs with no leakage.
