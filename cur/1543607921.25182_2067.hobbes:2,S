Actually, they swung the pendelum the other way for the 64-bit chips.  The
VSID's (MM contexts) are indirectly accessed via a hash-table (with an on
chip TLB-style cache called a SLB).
The speedup from using the software table-walk actually came from emulating
x86 instead of using the native hash tables.  Pretty slick that emulating a
30-year old MMU and improves performance on the PowerPC, eh?
There was an April Fools Microprocessor reports describing a processor that
had gone 64-bit and had a "twisted gothic nightmare of twisted logic" based
MMU that involved XOR-ing addresses with random numbers.  They were
unwittingly predicting the future of the PPC MMU.
The nightmares and shakes have never ended for me, either.  Sorry about
that, man.
} Gods, I hope they have reconsidered that in their 64-bit chips. The 32-bit
} hash chains may be ugly, but the architected 32/64-bit MMU stuff is just
} so incredibly baroque that it makes any other MMU look positively
} beautiful ("Segments? Segments shmegments. Big deal").
} 
} I still have the occasional nightmares about the IBM block diagrams
} "explaining" the PowerPC MMU in their technical documentation.

} There's probably a perfectly valid explanation for them, though (*).
