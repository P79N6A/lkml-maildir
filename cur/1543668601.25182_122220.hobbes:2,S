Yes. That'd solve that issue. You'd have it resize itself to your fixed
% of the new totals.

If you want to take swap into account you still can't but then this
patch changes nothing for you in either case. You'd still specify 400MB
or (now) 156%.

It can be, depending on what you do with it, obviously. That's not an
argument against this and I'm not actually against it myself. I just
want the current patch in cos at least it's a step in the right
direction, it's simple and it ups the usability of tmpfs (and it stops
me from having to patch my kernel each and every time ;).
Personally I'd like a flag to set wether or not to take it into account
because it introduces a 2nd potential variable number into the equation
and I don't want my setting depending on swap suddenly dropping off Gods
green, somewhat polluted and messy, earth. I'd be in the same boat I was
in before the patch.
