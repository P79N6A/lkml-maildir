Please describe precisely -how- it fails.
pci_enable_msi() does not fail properly on systems that do not support 
MSI.  This is a major unresolved problem that is preventing MSI 
deployment, and causing every driver writer to include a does-MSI-work 
test in their driver.
We need to find a good generic test, or if that fails, adopt an 
ACPI-like rule:  whitelist systems with working MSI before $X date, and 
blacklist systems with broken MSI after $X date.
