Greetings,
in sysfs, /sys/bus/*/drivers lists the driver names, with their exported 
.name (eg. '.name = "EMU10K1_Audigy"' in the module code, from now on 
'driver name'). In /sys/modules, the kernel modules are listed with 
their module name, eg. snd_emu10k1. However, it seems to me that in 
sysfs, there is no way in particular to tell, which module has which 
.name. That is, that snd_emu10k1 is EMU10K1_Audigy and vice versa.
I wonder whether it wouldn't be possible to add a symlink to the 
particular module from the driver, and/or from the module to the driver, 
so the list of devices handled by the module and the module name would 
be accessible. This way, I would know which driver name corresponds to 
which module name and vice versa.
Or am I just boldly missing something, and there is a way how to do this 
from userspace, preferably without reading /proc/kcore?
Thanks in advance for reply.
