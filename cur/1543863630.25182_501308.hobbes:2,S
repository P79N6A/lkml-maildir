If you don't know what changed you can try different options until the
filemap.s
is the same.  You should see
        movl   156(%ebp),%eax
        testb   16, 48(%eax)
in generic_file_buffered_write.  And you need to regenerate filemap.s
manually
each time.
(Did you test the kernel that you posted these pieces from? If you can
get it to oops
the same way, just post that instead.)
