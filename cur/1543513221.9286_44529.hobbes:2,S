I don't know about anyone else, but I agree with this. I'm looking for
an official word though.
I'd make ifconfig a facny script that turns your ifconfig command into
ip commands so that we could reduce the kernel interfaces at some point,
I'd also have it warn that ifconfig is old, use ip. Or something along
those lines...
