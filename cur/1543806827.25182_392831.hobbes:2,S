Yes, it is mostly clear, and indeed GPL3 seems a little bit over
engineered, but that doesn't mean that GPL2 could not have any
loopholes:
1. Release a kernel with builtin DRM for video. (For example HDCP [1])
   Such DRM implementation is released under the GPL2 by copyright
   holder A.
2. Distribute a modified kernel without DRM. Copyright holder A gave
   you permission to do so, by the GPL2, everything is OK.
3. People can backup videos from copyright holder B using the modified
   kernel.
4. Copyright holder B can sue you under the DMCA, for circumventing an
   effective technological measure. It doesn't matter whatever license 
   copyright holder A gave you.

Emilio
