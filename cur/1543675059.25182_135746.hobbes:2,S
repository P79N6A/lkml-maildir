not again ;)
I've tried almost all known kernel tree's around, every kernel has the same 
effect. I even tried SuSE and Redhat Kernels.
I've 'wasted' tons of time just find a solution for it.
Andrea introduced, to address _exact_ this problem (pauses, stops, mouse is 
dead etc.), his lowlatency elevator. Side effect: decreases i/o throughput, 
and the "pauses/stops" are still there. Much less but not gone.
The _only_ workaround yet (known to the public) is to change nr_requests in 
drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c from 128 to 4 which gives a performance hit of 
about 40% (not acceptable in any way).
.oO( I am quite sure I've mailed you all this stuff privately in response to 
      your private mail to me ;) )Oo.
ciao, Marc
