*Ugh*.  Not on ->open(), please...  _If_ you really want that sort of
on-demand allocation - make it happen via blk_register_region() and
allocate both gendisk and queue at once.
However, I would suggest to make that a separate patch and for now allocate
queues at the same place where you allocate gendisks, without any on-demand
stuff.
