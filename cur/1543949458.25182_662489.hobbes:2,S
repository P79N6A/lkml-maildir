Thanks. Have you tried turning lockdep off, if that still triggers?
Aparently the first BUG leaves the spin lock locked, and all subsequent 
accessess to it lock the machine hard. We'll need to see what goes wrong 
inside lockdep.
Could you please run
	addr2line -e vmlinux c0133034
(passing the path to the vmlinux binary of the crashing kernel to the -e 
parameter).
