It's not for Aunt Tillie.
It's for an average system administrator who compiles his own kernel.
CONFIG_BLOCK=n will only be for the "the kernel must become as fast as 
possible, and I really know what I'm doing" people.
There's no reason for getting linux-kernel swamped with
"my kernel doesn't boot" messages by people who accidentally disabled 
this option.
