follow_link on these guys does _not_ traverse parent directories.  So chdir()
checks are more relaxed that way.  Even if we made checks on readlink work
differently, we would still get an information leak - e.g. if task had
created a directory with pathname derived from sensitive data and did chdir
there.  Being able to kill a task != being able to see pieces of its state...
