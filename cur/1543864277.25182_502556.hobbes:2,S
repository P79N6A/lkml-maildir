I'm not sure I undersdand the point of your rant here. The hypervisor
case hooks at alloc/free and does everything from there. It doens't use
an enable or a diable hook.
The enable/disable ops are optional for that reason. When not present,
it's assumed that alloc/free do it all.
When using a "direct" approach (what we call "raw"), we expect backends
to just plug the provided helper functions in enable/disable. It's still
a hook so that one can do additional platform specific bits if
necessary, but in that specific case, I do agree we could just remove it
and move the "raw" code back into the toplevel functions, with a way
(via a special return code from alloc maybe ?) for the HV case to tell
us not to go through there. That was one of our initial approaches when
working with Michael on the design.
However, that sort of hurts my sense of aestetics :-) I quite like the
toplevel to be just a toplevel, and clearly separate the raw "helpers"
and the backend. Provides more flexibility to handle all possible crazy
cases in the future.
You seem to absolutely want to get the HV case to go throuh the same
code path as the "raw" case, and that will not happen.

This is indeed a lower level hook to be used by "raw" enable/disable. An
other approach would be to remove it, have each backend have it's own
enable/disable that obtains the address/data and calls into a helper to
program them. This would indeed be a little bit nicer in a layering
perspective. But it adds a bit more code to each backend, so we kept
things closer to the way they used to be. I don't have a firm reason not
to change it however, I need talk to Michael in case he has more good
reasons to keep it that way around.

And it it's not, we don't support them ? Ugh ? Well, it happens to be
fairly easy but still, I don't understand your approach there.

It doesn't work yet for you which is why it's not -replacing- your
current code. Again, this was intended as arch code in the first place,
until other archs and maintainers voiced their opinion that we should
move that to generic code. It may not be perfect, we may still want to
change things, maybe make some things closer to the direction you are
taking for the x86 code, but I don't understand the root of such a
strong opposition except mayeb that you've spent time trying to fix the
x86 junk and now are annoyed to see some of that work possibly
replaced ?
I agree with the problem if small changes & bisecting in the general
case. In fact, it would be nice if we could use your fixed code with
little change to "plug" it in as the x86 backend in many ways. Michael's
work isn't a re-implementation of everything, it's a re-structuring,
lots of bits of code that are missing can possibly be lifted from the
existing working implementation.
If we followed that "only do incrementental changes" rule all the time,
imagine in what state would be our USB stack today since we couldn't
have dropped in Linus replacement one ...
