Yes, but those defaults were chosen by a person who understood the
kernel part's use of the buffer space, right? Presumably if you
are writing your own relayfs client you know what type of
throughput to expect and what size you'd like your buffers to
be (bufsize and nbufs), so you need to be able to set this somehow
and it only seems right that this be done upon instantiation.

I don't see how. Do you have actual examples?
As for the other fields, please see my response to Roman.
