Again that is almost a generic answer, the *vast* majority of
mutex-semaphores is used in such a way that the down() and up() are
always in the same function, eg the pattern is 
down(semaphore);
do_stuff();
up(semaphore);
all the time. That's then a mutex... and the most basic use pattern.
Sure this isn't always the case but it's very common.
(there have been 2 cases that accidentally did
up(semaphore);
do_stuff();
down(semaphore);
.. which is legal with semaphores but not what was intended ;)
