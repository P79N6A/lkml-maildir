hello world,
i've invested a couple of hours to find a correct description of the
linux kernel achritecture. most books or litretures (in general) are
talking about a monoholitic kernel (incl. linux kernel development -
robert love and understanding the linux kernel - oreilly). i also asked
google an read the kernel.org faq.
the kernel were mostly descripted as monoholitic. but some sources means
that the linux kernel is not really monoholitic because of the feature
of loading kernel modules. some pages are talking about a "hybrid
kernel" which means that the kernel is a glue one, a little bit of
monoholitic and a little bit not.
so i would like to receive detailed information where i can read a
correct description of course you can also post your comments here (if
allowed). by the way, yes i've read the "tanenbaum" reffering monoholitc.
thanks a lot in advanced,
patrick
