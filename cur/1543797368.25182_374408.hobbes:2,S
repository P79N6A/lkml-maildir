No.  If platform_device_add() fails then you platform_device_put()
it with no other action.  If it's been added, with the current
available interfaces, your only option is to
platform_device_unregister() it.
So:
- error during platform_device_alloc, no additional action necessary
- error returned by platform_device_add, you have a structure allocated
  and initialised, you platform_device_put it.
- subsequently you want to get rid of it, platform_device_unregister it,
  or alternatively platform_device_del + platform_device_put it (where
  provided.)
This is actually a generic driver model rule which can be applied to
all driver model interfaces which have the alloc/init, add, del, put,
register, unregister methods.
