I haven't been following the initramfs stuff, but now I have a question. 
Currently we're using initrd to store a kernel and compressed ramdisk bundled
together as an ~7MB single file that gets netbooted by firmware in a card.  Will
it be possible to bundle initramfs together with the kernel into a single file
in this same manner?
Thanks,
Chris
