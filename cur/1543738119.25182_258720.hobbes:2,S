There is a presumption there that higher APIC revisions will be
backward-compatible and will have comparable version numbers, yes.

Which probably either predated or coincided with my earliest use of
computers.

Only documentation; this is probably as good as it gets, so I'm happy
with this level of explanation, for instance, saying what the revision
numbers are.

Since it's not available online this will have to do. I seem to have
turned up some vague evidence they were made into PDF's ca. 1993, but
don't really expect that to mean anything.
