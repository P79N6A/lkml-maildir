I think its pretty much x86 only that has the define problem. For 2.2 its 
stuck and one or two folks depend on it. For 2.4 I cannot see why we don't 
change the inline function to be current() not get_current() thereby cleaning
up the struct problem you see.
On the other platforms current is general a gcc register global and so wont
interfere with struct namespace
