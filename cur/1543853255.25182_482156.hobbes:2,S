You now have a disk which may be in use (and a block device) for which
there is no queue.  I couldn't see any locking what so ever in del_gendisk
so it's quite possible that the queue could still be referenced while
the disk is still open.
I also don't think del_gendisk() is sufficient to ensure that no new
requests appear in the queue, which is why I'm setting md->disk->queue
to NULL there.
But shug, I don't know the block layer.  Jens is your best bet.
