I used to have one.  I might even still have the source somewhere, but I can't
find it quickly.
Its fairly easy - init_module registers a file in /proc.  Reading that
file deferences a null pointer.
So you have (from memory, completely untested):
#include <linux/proc_fs.h>
int oops(/* can't remember the args*/) {
	/* Force an oops */
	foo = *(int *)0;
}
struct proc_dir_entry oopser={
   0,4,"Oops",00200,1,0,0,0,NULL,oops,
};
int init_module(void) {
	proc_register_dynamic(&proc_sys,&oopser);
}
void cleanup_module(void) {
	proc_unregister(&proc_sys,oopser.inode);
}
