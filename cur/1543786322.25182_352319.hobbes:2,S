Why do you think it cannot be a cache warming effect?

Because with this one the first case was the faster one, that would need 
cache cooling :)
But besides that, as far as I remember the actual loop is about 3 
instructions long and will be cache hot in a time that you'd never notice 
in the end result.
Sorry about the formatting, but it's lotus notes :/
