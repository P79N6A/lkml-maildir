Linus, even with source (Arla) the module breakage issue is a major problem.
CMU needs AFS on supported campus machines, not just dorm machines --- and
the use of 2.1.x / 2.2.x kernels in CMU LCS has been demonstrating on almost
a daily basis that binary module incompatibility is a serious problem.  (Some
of these machines *cannot* rebuild modules unless AFS is running or a large
amount of stuff is copied to the local drive.  If one of them is the first
to run a new kernel release, getting Arla running is a major project.)
And Arla, while it's coming along nicely, still has problems.  There's a
current thread about problems with Arla on 2.2.1, and I'm hearing the same
problems from CMU SCS.
("Drop AFS"?  *Here*?  You will be laughed at, and Linux will be dropped.
Study where AFS came from, and why.  Arla's not there yet, neither is Coda,
and retrofitting either onto all the machines here would be a nearly
impossible task in any case.  Not to mention migrating servers, in the case
of Coda.)

What has AFS done for us lately, though?  It glues the entire CMU computing
environment together.
I REPEAT:  AFS IS NON-NEGOTIABLE HERE.
We're not all that happy about the situation either, but we aren't in a
position to do anything about it and won't be for some time.  (Why do you
think Coda exists?  But Coda's not yet ready to take over for AFS.)  If in
the meantime Linux continues to be a problem, then it is Linux that will
have to be dropped.

     We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
