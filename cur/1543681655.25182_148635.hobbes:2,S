I have a strange problem that I cannot seem to
find the answer to. 2.4.x works great on my
T23, but I have still not been able to boot
2.5.x properly. I just tried 2.5.75 and the 2.6.0-test.
Not even with a "make allnoconfig", and then
adding just the bare minimum, like IDE support.
I have a good experience from configuring 2.4.x
for T23, so I believe I know what needs to be
included for it to work.
After selecting the kernel in the grub menu,
it only gets as far as to writing "Decompressing kernel...
Booting kernel.". Then there is no more text
output. The harddisk led indicates it continues
with something though, but it does not respond
to keyboard input (so I have to swith the computer
off).
Sorry to bother you with this, but perhaps it turns
out to be important for finding some bug. Please
CC me with any replies to this. Rgds /Per
