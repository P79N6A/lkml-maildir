For me it's worse than G2 but still good.
With vanila kernel patched with your patch (G7) on top of 2.6.0-test2
I can watch a movie while doing make -j 5 bzImage in the background
With Con Kolivas O10 (on top on 2.6.0-test2-mm1) I can't watch a
movie while doing make bzImage
Setup is the same: minimal window manager (fvwm),
a couple of processes sleeping and only make and mplayer running
