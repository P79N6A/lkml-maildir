It is not a real rwlock.  It acts like a rwlock but allows you to sleep
while reading (not while writing).

The special locking takes care of that on SMP systems.  The problem
is on UP where there is no locking at all!

Again - it is not a real rwlock, it is a strange home grown creature...

In fact the odd locking is trying to be a rw_semaphore: a semaphore
with any number of readers, but at most one writer, and no writers
while there are readers.  I am a bit surprised that such a semaphore
does not exist in the kernel...

Neither am I!
Thanks, Duncan.
