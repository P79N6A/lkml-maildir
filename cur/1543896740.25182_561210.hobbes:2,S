Hello,
I am writing a USB driver for some custom hardware, and I need to
synchronize between the user-space and the USB subsystem.  Can I
create a semaphore and "down" it in the reader then "up" it in the
completion handler?
I know the completion handler runs in interrupt context so you are not
allowed to acquire any semaphores: but can you release them?  Will the
waiting tasks wake up after the handler and its caller returned - IOW
will the waking up task run in interrupt context as well?
This is with Linux 2.4 (if it makes a difference).
Thanks,
florin
