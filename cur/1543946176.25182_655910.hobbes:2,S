Hi there, 
I would like flash my D-link DVG-G1402S with linux ADM5120 port. It should be 
possible, but I would like still use it as a SIP gateway. There is Infineon 
PEB 3332 EL responsible for that job, so my question is if it is supported.
BTW this router's internals photos are there:

Thanks a lot for reply
