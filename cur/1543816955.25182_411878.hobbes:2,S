The point is: It does not matter that is another chain!
It will _not_ boost any task which doesn't need boosting, because it is
not boosting according to current->prio but always task->pi_waiters. So
all it does is to fix the priorities on some tasks. There is
absolutely nothing wrong with that. But these task will already have the
right priorities, because the new outermost locker (T1') will have
traversed the list and done the boosting. So current will stop boosting
and break out of the loop (unless it is doing deadlock detection).
But what about the original chain? Well, as the tasks aren't blocked
anymore, they doesn't need boosting anymore, so no boosting missed either.
Or if they are blocked on something else, the those locking operations
have or will take care of it.
