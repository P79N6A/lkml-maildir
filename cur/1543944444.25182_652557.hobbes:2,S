Hi,
I'm reworking the pci device list logic (we currently keep all PCI
devices in 2 lists, which isn't the nicest, we should be able to get
away with only 1 list.)
The only bother I've found so far is the pci_get_device_reverse()
function, it's used in 2 places, IDE and the calgary driver.
I'm curious if we really still support the ide=reverse option?  It's a
config option that I don't think the distros still enable (SuSE does
not).  Is this still needed these days?
In digging, we changed this option in 2.2.x from being called
"pci=reverse" and no one else seems to miss it.
Any thoughts?
thanks,
greg k-h
