I think, if you are going to reserve a system-call for "security",
all you need is one. And, I think you need to reserve one.
By default, it calls a dummy procedure that just returns "okay".
The security folks can write a module that interfaces with this
one security-hook. You only need one such hook because a system
call can get a pointer to some structure that tells it what to
do. You don't need "N" system calls, only one.
Such a simple hook is quite likely the way-to-go. No cruft in
the kernel, and upon some reported error, the development people
can say; "Unload the security module and see if you still have
the error..."
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
