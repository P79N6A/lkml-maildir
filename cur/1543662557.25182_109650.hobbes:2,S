           Summary: Error when compiling SCSI drivers (Adaptec, Seagate
                    etc.)
    Kernel Version: 2.5.60 (- bk4)
            Status: NEW
          Severity: normal
             Owner: andmike@us.ibm.com
         Submitter: martinsteeg@t-online.de
Software Environment: linnx Kernel 2.5.60 ( and snapshots -bk1 ... -bk4)  
Problem Description:   
  In the change of linux-2.5.59 to linux-2.5.60, the struct scsi_cmnd   
  was changed in that the fields host, target, lun, channel are replaced   
  by fields of the device field (struct scsi_device*): host, id, lun,
channel       
  This is not reflected in several SCSI drivers, e.g. the change is not  
  considered for Adaptec and Seagate SCSI controllers.  
Proposal to fix the Problem:  
1. some new defines for drivers/scsi/scsi.h  
+#define SCSICMND_HOST     device->host  
+#define SCSICMND_TARGET   device->id  
+#define SCSICMND_LUN      device->lun  
+#define SCSICMND_CHANNEL  device->channel  
2. replacing the lines of drivers/scsi/*.c containing the following code  
-(ptr)->host  
+)ptr)->SCSICMND_HOST  
-(ptr)->target  
+)ptr)->SCSICMND_TARGET  
-(ptr)->lun  
+)ptr)->SCSICMND_LUN  
-(ptr)->channel  
+)ptr)->SCSICMND_CHANNEL
