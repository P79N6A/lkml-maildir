Hello all
I just upgraded the kernel on our server to 2.4.9 last friday.  We made some
changes to some script files that night, and discovered that the changes
were gone this morning.  A check of the backup tape that ran friday night
verifies that the changes were made, and a poll around the office yields
that noone changed them....
I had a dig through the kernel log and turned up the following message:
Aug 26 03:02:37 chaos kernel: (scsi0:A:0:0): Locking max tag count at 64
Does this have anything to do with it?  It seemed wierd to me - I had never
seen it before.  If anyone can enlighten me as
to what it means I'd really appreciate it.
Thanks
Mark
