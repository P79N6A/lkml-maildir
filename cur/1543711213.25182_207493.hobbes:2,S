As you've already noticed below, it's completely up to the driver -- and 
I don't trust i2c drivers I haven't written... ;-)

In theory this should be sufficient, but doesn't help if you have some 
"I don't care which bus this is and I'll probe it anyway" device.
Just think of all the i2c client drivers that are not part of the 
official kernel. I don't want to fix all these, just keep them away from 
"my" i2c busses...

Ok, thanks. I'm heading for the small solution that doesn't break any 
existing "functionality" (if it's desired or not) and that doesn't 
require to touch every i2c driver in the kernel.
Here is the agenda:
- add a "class" field to the i2c client driver struct (ie. let the 
driver specify "I'm a DVB device" for example)
- add a flag to the adapter struct telling the i2c core "I only want 
drivers with a matching class to probe on this bus"
- make the i2c core actually check if an adapter has set the flag 
mentioned above and only let any i2c clientprobe on the bus if it has 
the matching class field
This won't break existing functionality (because all "old" i2c client 
drivers don't have the "class" field set and all "old" i2c adapters 
don't have the new flag specified) and will keep all i2c client drivers 
away from my DVB i2c busses.
The DVB i2c drivers, however, will be able to probe on the DVB i2c bus.
