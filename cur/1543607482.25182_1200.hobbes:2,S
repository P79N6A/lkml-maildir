Hi,
2.4.13 and .13-pre6 hang when I try to write to the tape drive.
2.4.10 is fine.  ("Hung" == machine does not respond to ping.)
Dual PIII, eepro100, Adaptec 2930CU onboard SCSI.  Ecrix tape drive is
on 1st channel, hard disk (reiserfs) is on the other channel.
No messages saved in log; I didn't have time to hook up a screen, as
the machine is very heavily used.  If desired, I can warn our folks,
come in at night and repeat it to see what shows up on the console.
Thanks,
--Pete
