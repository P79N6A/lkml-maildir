I like the idea, but I'm a little worried that it actually introduces
more problems than it solves. See the mail from yesterday for instance,
perfectly fine code but 'as' poisoning triggered.
And the merging bits already look really ugly :/
So I guess my question is, did this code ever find any driver problems?
