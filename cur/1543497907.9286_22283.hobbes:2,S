	No, when such has appeared ?  ... A week ago ?
	Now that I have browsed a bit of that document which you
	referred here, I still don't think it supplies anything
	special.  In fact I think it is in amazingly lots of ways
	like SPARCs are.
	128 integer registers, 128 FP registers, and lots of
	other user-level registers, many of which need saving
	in context switches ...  Looks like intel has joined
	SPARC family in register window technology (there was
	a note about register windowing exploitable at function
	calls), and various pains which relate to massive amounts
	of registers to be saved/loaded during a context switch.
	Where ia-32 is register-poor, at least its context switches
	are fairly fast...
	The instruction format expects 3+1 longwords (32-bits each)
	worth of instruction stream data, and although its ways
	to explicitely combine integer and float instructions are
	more versatile (=complicated) than what DEC 21264 Alpha
	can do, it can barely match said Alpha processor in speed
	of instructions per clock cycle.  (That alpha can do up
	to 2i+2fp instructions per clock.)
	Sure it can do wonders for a speed-daemon usages, like me
	using pico to edit email, but a 386 can do that too...
	Getting the best out of that instruction format in applications
	does require lots of smarts in the compiler, and (I hazard a
	guess) application which does lots of things without frequent
	function calls, or system calls.
	There definitely is no amazing magic bullet to speed things
	up tremendously.   It might be a decent tool for heavy computing
	environments, but it is not alone at it.
