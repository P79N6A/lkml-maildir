If you mean stack-based register file, then that's *not* desirable; 
Linux depends on gcc which prefers a flat register file.  16 registers 
minimum.

Don't necessarily have to be hardware registers, although it speed 
things up.  Interrupt stacks are good.

Not in Linux.

No, it would just be in a different place.  Linux will *NOT* accommodate 
this model.

No, the x86 is lacking quite a few key features.
Linux would prefer to have address space numbers, instructions for 
user-space memory access in kernel mode, and a larger page size (4K is 
really too small for modern multi-gigabyte machines.)
The design of the I/O infrastructure is another matter, too.
