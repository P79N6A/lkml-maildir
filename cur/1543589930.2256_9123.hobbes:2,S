Errrmmm... _That_ is not too horrible - e.g. SCSI definitely belongs
to core. Individual drivers, OTOH, do not and there's a lot of them.
I'm not talking about connectedness of the thing. However, I suspect that
graph has a small subset such that removing it makes it fall apart.
IOW, you have a small well-connected backbone and a lot of small groups
around it, such that each path from one group to another hits the
backbone. ACK? Picture you've described doesn't contradict that - there's
a relatively small number of symbols that correspond to subsystems and
tons of stuff hanging from that subset.
Look at it as a network. How many sites do you need to nuke to break it
into tiny bits?
