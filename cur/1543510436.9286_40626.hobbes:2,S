1.1.3 actually. The primary reason for this is that we didn't have enough
time to fix up every package. The new development version (Cooker,
http://www.linux-mandrake.com/cooker/
) is using gcc 2.95.1 for now. [We
consider pgcc 2.95.1 to be too buggy for use as a default compiler right
now - try its "-mmx" option and you see one of the reasons].
