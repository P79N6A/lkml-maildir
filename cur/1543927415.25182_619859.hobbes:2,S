The code was
	/* it *should* be: chip->release != NULL */
	if (chip->release)
and the I took the comment to mean that it should be
	if (chip->release != NULL)
I was just pointing out that the test-pointer-as-truth-value trick is
smiled upon in kernel coding.

From the above it appears that the code comment misled me.
