Even from an "abstract" point of view the unification between char and
block
devices in the classic UNIX paradigm doesn't fit for the "plurality" of
attachable
physical devices we alredy currently have at the market.
At the old days there where basically just: mass storage -- block
devices
and terminals -- character devices.
But currently we have: still mass storage, where block devices are still
a perfect fit 
and the whole zoo of all the other gadgets like video camers, mices,
palm pilots and so on,
where the unification (in classic unix) is just comming in between. The
first sight
that this fundamental design (to have either block based access or just
serial access)
wasn't sufficient was the introduction of a first new separate calss of
devices:
namely networking stuff. Therefore it will for the future make perfect
sense as
Linus is proposing it to make the split between classical char devices
and block devices
(read: mass storage) even more explicit in the design of the kernel.
This will surely
pay for itself as time will pass by and the designers came up with even
more
interresting stuff that one will be able to use in conjuonction with a
central
processing unit ;-). 
However I still thing that STRING identifyers inside a kernel
are a bad idea and therefore for example the devfs isn't the proper
soultion, it's
just another symptom (read: ad hock solution of no generic value)
of the basic paradigm problems just described in the sentence
above...

It was exactly the primary intention of my "naive attempt at the kdev_t"
patch to 
acutlly show it the *hard way* how deeply missused this thing get's.
Otherwise I would have changed it to a pointer to some kind of struct of
course...
And sometimes there is even the need for somebody who just doesn't tell:
"All things are wonderfull, keep them until the earth stops rotating as
they are".
However in this particular case I will maybe seriously try to provide
some
of the needed solutions as actual code (If time just permitts.)
