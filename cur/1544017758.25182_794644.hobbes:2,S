Not clear what that comment means ... dev_vdbg() is the same as
dev_dbg() *IF* the VERBOSE option is set, and is otherwise a NOP.
That is:  two levels of debug messaging, for use as needed.
As a rule, some Kconfig option will
  ccflags-$(CONFIG_DEBUG_whatever)    += -DDEBUG
to enable DEBUG for that subsystem, and the VERBOSE option
(see <linux/device.h>) is set selectively by hand.
