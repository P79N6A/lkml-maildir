Q writes ("connection in time_wait owned by root"):

The information about who did own the socket has been lost so it can't
print the correct uid. Having said that, printing -1 for 'no uid' in
/proc/net/tcp would be more helpful than 0.

No, it shouldn't; it should return NO_USER if the connection is not
established. Here's a patch for identd.
