Not much of an interface. Note that pnp_clean_resource_table is an internal 
helper function in drivers/pnp/manager.c, unexported and with a mere three 
call sites that each call it as pnp_clean_resource_table(&dev->res). A small 
internal helper like this need really not be an argument.

I suppose you mean put the count inside the resource _table_ structure? It 
is a count of resource structures after all. Inside the table is where he 
did in fact propose it would go (dev->res.allocated_ports) but logically a 
pnp_dev and its pnp_resource_table are one and the same; "res" is embedded 
in the pnp_dev. That is, the resources are tied to the device, with struct 
pnp_resource_table being no more than a handy container to group them under 
a single name.
Only the pnp_resource_change export (that is, the pnp_init_resource_table 
and pnp_manual_config_dev exports) give a pnp_resource_table struct slightly 
more of a life of its own but those are only used by the ALSA ISAPnP drivers 
in what I as stated before personally consider a bad layering violation and 
would be more than happy to fix after which they can just go -- they have no 
possible uses _other_ than layering violations.
See the existing pnp design as well; all the resource stuff does the same 
thing in taking a pnp_dev and then returning from dev->res:
#define pnp_port_start(dev,bar)   ((dev)->res.port_resource[(bar)].start)
#define pnp_port_end(dev,bar)     ((dev)->res.port_resource[(bar)].end)
and so on. From a consistency standpoint making his new setup use this same 
paradigm makes sense to me therefore.

Yes, I dont know how he intends to deal with this (nor, in fact, just how 
dynamic things are supposed to end up to begin with) so over to Thomas.

Really. Only pnp_irq -> pnp_irq_start (or _no if really need be) and same 
for dma. Not exactly a high-invasiveness thing.

Yes, not hugely fond of the lvalue thing either. Andrew commented that he 
found if to be okay-ish from a consistency standpoint. <shrug>
Quite frankly, I've had enough email to PnP maintainer(s) disappear into 
blackholes now that I'm happy already to see some action. If I'm right that 
I should consider Bjorn Helgaas the PnP maintainer now, I'd vote he gets a 
say here. Without the magic assignments I guess you'd need helper functions 
for them.

As to the latter bit, I'm not sure there's any point in the "without the 
device structure" bit. As argued above, the resources are fully tied to the 
device.
As to the locking, I suppose we could use a more fully complete patchset to 
judge whether or not these preparations are good but it _looks_ like Thomas 
is trying for a fairly minimally invasive route here which in itself seems 
to coincide with your wishes.
