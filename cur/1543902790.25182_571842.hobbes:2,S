Not wanting to get into any flamewars here about selinux, but just FYI:
security_sb_post_mountroot is obsolete and can be removed without harm
to selinux; it is a leftover of selinux before we moved the initial
policy load to userspace.  These days, initial policy load is done
by /sbin/init in most distros that support selinux, although I'd prefer
to do it earlier from the initramfs (the Fedora folks didn't like that
idea though at the time, so /sbin/init got patched instead - but that
was back in 2003, so maybe things have changed).
