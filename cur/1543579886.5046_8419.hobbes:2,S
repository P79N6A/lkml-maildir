The interesting bit is the "Cisco does not have a stable OS..." part.
I've been told repeatedly by the Cisco folks that a stable supported
patch is available from them for their firewall products which were
rejecting ECN packets.
I'd really like Cisco to reaffirm this and furthermore, and
furthermore get in contact with and correct the hotmail folks
if necessary.
I have in fact noticed that some sites that did have the problem have
installed the fix and are now accessible with ECN enabled.
