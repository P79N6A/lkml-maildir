You misunderstood me. For 2.4.X it is:
Real PS/2 mouse -> /dev/psaux -> PS/2 protocol -> X server
All mice using /dev/input/mice -> PS/2 protocol -> X server
Yes mice. I have had 5 mice attached and going to the X server. It was no
problem. Multiple keyboards, well that is another story :-( It doesn't
matter to the X server if two different devices are sending the same
protocol. Since the protocol is coming in from two different devices theri
is no conflict. I believe we was having problems with another type of
mouse.

I see Vojtech has answered this already.
MS: (n) 1. A debilitating and surprisingly widespread affliction that
renders the sufferer barely able to perform the simplest task. 2. A disease.
