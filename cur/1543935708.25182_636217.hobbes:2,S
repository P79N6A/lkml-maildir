i agree. There a few practical complication on x86: the do_page_fault() 
function is currently excluded from kprobe probing, for recursion 
reasons. handle_mm_fault() can be probed OTOH - but that does not catch 
vmalloc()-ed faults. The middle of do_page_fault() [line 348] should 
work better [the point after notify_page_fault()] - but it's usually 
more fragile to insert probes to such middle-of-the-function places.
So probing pagefaults is not as easy as it should/could be. We should 
put a practical NOP marker to around line 348, to make it easier (and 
faster) for systemtap to probe there.
(__kprobes is a highly confusing newspeak name btw - it should be 
__noprobe instead.)
