I noticed the smell of danger in the naming of "Security Model".

Updated above two items. Thank you. :)
I'm not an optimist to believe we can reach the perfect
comparison. The purpose is to feed information, not to judge.
This might sound ironically, but I don't really think
we can *compare* them because they have different
theories/purposes/backgrounds. Some kind of forgiveness and
fuzziness are required.
As I don't want to steal everybody's bandwidth,
simple updates will be done silently. Your suggestions and
information will be greatly appreciated despite of
visible evidence.
Thank you.
