1) Is it true that one cannot change the default ramdisk size
without changing the source code if ramdisk was compiled as
module? (The ramdisk_size boot parameter does not seem to work
in this case).
2) How do I free the ramdisk? Does kernel do it automatically?
If so, what are the conditions for this? And what would be the
consequences in the case of a large RAM disks (~100 MB)?
There is in example of an old freeramdisk program which does smth
like
f=open(ram_device,O_RDWR);
ioctl(f,BLKFLSBUF);
close(f);
Will it do the job? Will it work on arbitrary ramdisk size?
Please CC me if you reply to the list.
Thanks.
