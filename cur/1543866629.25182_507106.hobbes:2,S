I think that would be tempting people to abuse it, for example by defining or
undefining things just to quieten the warning.
In my opinion the only way to make the warning go away should be to define
a non-NULL .suspend (.resume) routine and that's why I don't think the warning
should be mandatory.

I think the distro people can patch their kernels to fit their needs.

Well, IMO, if someone doesn't know how to compile and install the kernel,
he'll be using a distro kernel anyway and then see above.  Otherwise we can
safely ask him to turn on whatever debugging options we need.
