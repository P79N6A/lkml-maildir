   Since I don't have a requirement for the trap handler, I have it
   disabled, especially as outgoing IP packets over ethernet
   definitely should always be aligned.
I would suggest enabling it so that you can support IPX and other
various protocols.
Disabling it in development kernels to find incidents like this
is fine though, and was a large benefit in this case.
