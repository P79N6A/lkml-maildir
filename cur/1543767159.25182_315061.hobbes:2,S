  However, you have a potential problem with registered buffers that
do not begin or end on a page boundary, which is common with malloc.
If the buffer resides on a portion of a page, and you mark the vm
which contains that entire page VM_DONTCOPY, to ensure that the parent
has access to the exact physical page after the fork, the child will
not be able to access anything on that entire page. So if the child
expects to access data on the same page that happens to contain the
registered buffer it will get a segment violation.
The four situations we've discussed are:
  1) Physical page does not get used for anything else.
  2) Processes virtual to physical mapping remains fixed.
  3) Same virtual to physical mapping after forking a child.
  4) Forked child has access to all non-registered memory of
     the parent.
The first two are now taken care of with get_user_pages, (we use to
use VM_LOCKED for the second case) third case is handled by setting
the vm to VM_DONTCOPY, and on the fourth case we've always punted,
but the real answer is to break partial pages into seperate vms and
mark them ALWAYS_COPY.
