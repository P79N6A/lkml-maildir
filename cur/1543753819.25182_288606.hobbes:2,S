It would be nice to know which one really is :) Here are what I have here:

My eyes can't find anything related, but you know how intuitive these
things are ;)

Yes, but that is with (old) jack_test3 where clients were stand-alone,
without being connected to anyother. With (new) jack_test4, each client
gets all its inputs connected to all the output ports of the preceding
one. In my experience, with this (new) setup you achieve a much greater
workload with a lesser number of running clients.
If seems funny, but highly suspicious, that in both of my machines, a
P4@2.5Ghz/UP laptop and a P4@3.3Ghz/SMP desktop, the limit is somewhat the
same: jackd stops responding as soon the 15th client enters the chain.
Currently on jackd 0.99.47 (cvs), but I'm quite sure that was occurring
before.

Probably. That was what I thought and then worked around by increasing the
maximum number of ports jackd preallocates (-p/--port-max option), but I
guess it is not enough. It was on jack_test3, but it isn't for jack_test4.
Go figure ;)
Bye now.
