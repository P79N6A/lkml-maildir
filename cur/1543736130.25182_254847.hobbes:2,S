I would not normally quote an an entire message, but it contains data relevant to this problem.
The hang below occurs even outside of GDB, and also occurs after upgrading the kernel:
Linux bbox.memeplex.com 2.6.8-1.521 #1 Mon Aug 16 09:01:18 EDT 2004 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux
Can anyone please give me a clue/pointer to tools/techniques that might help identify where in the kernel the hang occurs?  The
system is so completely unresponsive when this occurs that I cannot provide any forensic data.
Does anyone's experience show that these types of hangs might occur purely as the result of use (or mis-use) of the pthreads
library?  I'm looking for hints about what parts of my code to review.
There could easily be erroneous calls to pthread_detach(), pthread_join(), close(), and other system calls involved.
Thanks,
Andrew Athan

Subject: Consisten kernel hang during heavy TCP connection handling load
I have written a pair of applications the server side of which consistently causes my Linux Fedora Core 2 system to become
completely unresponsive; all consoles hang, and it no longer services network connections.
The applications engage in the rapid opening and closing of TCP connections.  The server side is multithreaded (# threads approx 5).
It services the connections by dumping data into them from a file.  The client side reads no data.  The server then receives EAGAIN
from send(...,MSG_NOWAIT) calls, and issues 5ms sleep before resending on any particular TCP connection.  It loops up to 20 times
waiting for the the connection to become unblocked.  The applications are running within GDB, and threads *are* created/destroyed
during the process.
I will change the application to use select() rather than sleeping on a blocked pipe.  However, I don't think it's a "good thing"
that the machine hangs so completely.
I looked for tools to help catch the kernel before it goes la-la (assuming it's the kernel going la-la), but got
frustrated/ran-out-of-time.  E.g., lkcd seems defunct.
If pointed in the right direction, I would be happy to perform further forensics after re-creating the hang.  I am also in the
process of upgrading the kernel to see if that resolves the problem.
