I can't get my mind around that vision (and I've tried).  I am simply
too familiar with the "one make per directory" world.
Also I think that particular project is too big and I'd rather work on
incremental improvements, such as moving ramdisk and video configuration
out of the Makefiles and into CONFIG_* variables where they belong.
