Right, the description fits. OTOH I recall the criticism had a fair
amount of merit. That's how the things work here. Been there many
times BTW.

Nope, the fix which didn't change Kconfig and just assumed HDLC=m and
SYNCLINK*=y => HDLC is not available. I.e., the one with
#if defined(CONFIG_HDLC_MODULE) &&/|| defined(CONFIG_SYNCLINK*something)
#define CONFIG_HDLC something
changed into
#if defined(CONFIG_HDLC_MODULE) &&/|| defined(CONFIG_SYNCLINK*something)
#define USE_HDLC something
        ^^^^^^^^

It may look like that sometimes but it's not real. Anyway I think
everyone would benefit from the correct fix and the issue wouldn't
come again. Having looked at it I'd fix it myself but I'm pretty
sure you still have the old patch (which changes CONFIG_ macros
outside Kconfig, I mean in .c files) and it could be trivially
modified then applied (and perhaps tested with real hardware if
needed).
