Uhm... none of that "expensive optimization" will help you here,
because you need *architectural storage*.  Archtectural storage is
always a fundamentally limited resource, regardless of how many shadow
registers you add.
However, an x86 has a whole additional register file which is rarely
used these days -- the segment register file.  The segment register
file is mainly useful when the main usage is address offsetting, since
it provides an extra input into the address adder.  For this
particular purpose, using it is very much the sane thing to do.
As far as %gs switching is concerned, using %gs doesn't automatically
mean using the LDT.  There are two ways you can avoid setting up LDTs
in single-threaded apps, and still allow an ABI compatible with the
threaded apps:
a) For single-threaded apps, define %gs == %ds.  Less than ideal for
   several reasons, but no kernel mods needed.
b) Have the kernel provide another GDT value which can be used by the
   single-threaded apps.
