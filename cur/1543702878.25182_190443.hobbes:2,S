Both SuSE and Red Hat submit bugfixes they put in the respective trees to
marcelo already. There will not be many "pure bugfixes" that you can find in
vendor trees but not in marcelo's tree.

None of the vendors in question is still doing development based on 2.4 (in
fact I suspect no linux vendor/distro still is) so if you want vendors to go
to a joint patch for such a specific enhancement, which WILL include
development, I really don't see the point. Neither SuSE nor Red Hat will be
jumping from joy to do a lot of work to replace a patch that works in their
respective existing products with something else with no clear gain at all,
while requiring significant work and stability risks.
