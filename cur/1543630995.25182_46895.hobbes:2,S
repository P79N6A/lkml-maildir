It looks like you didn't install the kernel update. Below is a piece of 
my RH 7.3 article:
Kernel panic on SMP systems with ext3 file systems is now fixed. 
A few bugs, including one in ext3 that could cause a kernel panic
on SMP systems, are fixed in a kernel errata.
If you experienced the filesystem panic, you are recommended to
check filesystem consistency.  This bug will show up as one of
"kernel BUG at journal.c:406" or "kernel BUG at commit.c:535"
(The check is done in two places in the source code, and either
of them might show up.)
To force the filesystem check, log in as root, run
touch /forcefsck
and then reboot the system.  It will check all the filesystems
after rebooting.  This needs to be done only once after you
experience the panic.  
The whole article can be found at:

The update should solve your problem.
