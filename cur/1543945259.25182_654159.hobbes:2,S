Very nice! If it's that simple then the kgdb integration is really
clean.

Some comments on the specific patch:

I would rather export some generic wrapper for that than the full genapic
structure.

Hmm, might be a bit dangerous to call this directly -- there are various
quirks with e.g. not rebooting on CPU #0 and not resetting APIC 
state. But ok [this is not directly related to the fact that it's
exported now, just mentioning this in general]
