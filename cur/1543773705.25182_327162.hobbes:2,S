 How is the range defined -- is there a way for us to find it?  I'd assume 
in the absence of a PCI-ISA or PCI-EISA bridge all I/O port addresses 
belong to PCI.  Otherwise the usual rule of "(addr & 0x300) == 0" applies.  
Perhaps with the addition of "(addr & ~0xff) != 0" for safety as junk I/O 
is often not recorded properly in BARs, sigh...

 Certainly, but as long as they are seen as IDE devices on PCI, our driver 
can discover them and use without the need of probing through 
ide_default_io_base().

 Sure.

 The code is OK with me, but I've been wondering whether a more general 
approach would be possible.  And poking blindly at any of these ports, 
including the "traditional" primary and secondary IDE interfaces, is 
unsafe if there is no legacy bridge in the system, because you either hit 
an innocent arbitrary device that happens to have a BAR configured for 
that range or get a master abort (I'm not sure what it results in for the 
i386 -- an NMI?) if nobody listens.
 Actually there should have always been a set of BARs for the (E)ISA in 
legacy bridges, which would have made the whole mess be avoided, sigh...
