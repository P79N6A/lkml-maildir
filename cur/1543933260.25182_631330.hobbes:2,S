I know when I'm looking for memory leaks, I've asked customers to give
snapshots of slabinfo at periodic times (once a day even, matters how bad
the leak is). This has been helpful in seeing if something did indeed
leak.
If you have a slab cache that constantly grows, and never shrinks, that's
a good indication that something might be leaking. Not always, since there
can be legitimate reasons for that, but sometimes it helps.
But I still scratch my head when ever I need to touch sysfs.
