OK, I stand corrected, you found -one- basis for my paranoia.  There might
indeed be others.  However, only -one- counter-example is required to
invalidate a proposed algorithm.  ;-)

I am concerned about this as well, and am beginning to suspect that I
need to make a special-purpose primitive specifically for Jens that he
can include with his code.
That said, some potential advantages of per-CPU elements that might see
cache thrashing are:
1.	the cross-CPU references might be rare.
2.	memory contention is reduced compared to a single variable that
	all CPUs are modifying.
Unfortunately, #1 seems unlikely in Jens's case -- why would the completion
be so lucky as to show up on the same CPU as did the request most of the
time?  #2 could be important in I/O heavy workloads with fast devices.

NMIs?  ECC errors?  Cache misses?  And, as you say, virtualized
environments.
