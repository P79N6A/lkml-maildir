What you see here is the internal representation of the select expression. To 
make it more easily readable, you could just cut off everything between && 
and || (it's the dependency of the symbol which does the select, the one 
before &&).
The readable expression could be generated when needed, but it might be easier 
to just generate at the same time as the full expression (in menu_finalize).

I don't quite understand. The dependency for option itself is above the 
location tree and the for dependencies of the dependencies you have to look 
at their individual info.

Only if you enable the missing dependency. This is insofar a little easier as 
they are linked if you enable the deubg info, so the prompt may be a little 
easier to find.
