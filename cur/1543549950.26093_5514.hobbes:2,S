Subject: 2.2.18pre10: A few warnings less...
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

A few extra notes:
- Several places use long (or unsigned long) formats for the result of
  ntohl(), this is a 32-bit quantity. Makes no difference on ia32, but could
  bite on Alpha (an int is 32, a long is 64 there)
- There are several headers for NFS:
    include/linux/nfs.h
    include/linux/nfs2.h
    include/linux/nfs3.h
    include/linux/nfsd/const.h
  Several constants defined in nfs?.h are repeated in nfsd/const.h, which
  on the whole seems to be more complete than the others. Should this stuff
  be moved into nfs?.d, and nfsd/const.h deleted? What about nfs.h, which
  duplicates other stuff?
- The whole nls stuff is a bunch of tables plus a few functions and
  structures  that look like boilerplate code to my (untrained) eye. I'd
  rewrite the whole lot as the tables plus an #included file that gives the
  rest, to reduce the possibility of code skew. They all seem to have a
  (minor) bug in that their users (e.g, fs/vfat/namei.c:679)pass a const char
  pointer to ->char2uni() (one of the functions replicated in each nls
  module) which is declared to take a plain char pointer. This function
  doesn't modify anything, so const char pointer is really right. But to
  change them all is a mess... I'd prefer to do it as explained earlier.
