PATCH: Fix scrollback with logo issue immediately after boot.
From: David Hollister <david.hollister@amd.com>
After the system boots with the logo, if the first action is a
scrollback, the screen may become garbled.  This patch ensures
that the softback_curr value is updated along with softback_in
following the scrollback.
