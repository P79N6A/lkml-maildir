Hm, doesn't this mean that you can't read hde+hdg faster than hdc gives
parity data? That'd mean hde+hdg are not maxing out HPT and PCI channel...
You could perhaps run 2 separate wrchk's on hde and hdg (and one on hdc if
you please) - you can use it on file as well as on device.

I have usually used ~64MB blocks¹, but I don't it matters.
¹) For those too lazy to read the source, wrchk args are [1] device 
   or file [2] test file size [3] read/write block size [4] num of
   iterations (0 for infinite test) ;).

Is this RTL or 905B? We had better success with RTL8139 (but corruption
happened still), whereas with 3c905b would trigger corruption almost
instantly if it was attached to PCI slot 4. In slot 3, it behaved a lot
better, but the corruption eventually happened.

Hmm, we never ran X at all.

Yep, I think the udma mode makes difference. Though we did try UDMA33, but
it didn't solve the problem for us.

Better verify that with hdparm -tT...

Neither did we. We usually lanched the kernel from boot floppy and had the
rootfs on cd. This way it wasn't possble to destruct anything while
testing...

We tried 2.2.20+ide, 2.2.21pre2+ide, 2.4.15, 2.4.18pre-something+ide etc. It
didn't make difference.
