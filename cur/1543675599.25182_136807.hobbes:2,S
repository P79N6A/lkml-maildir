The only way I could think of was perhaps using a load on another disk 
(io_other which is in contest) that is using jffs2 when the contest baseline 
is running on a normal filesystem - this has shown very little differences 
between filesystems normally. Otherwise if everything in contest is run on 
jffs2 it would affect every layer and hard to be sure you had a control to 
compare with.
