This is misleading--Clearcase stores versions on top a normal
filesystem (like most other RCS's), and all manipulation is entirely
in user-space (over the network to server processes).  There only
filesystem magic is that there are directories you cannot list (plus
permission semantics are a little funny).
Seems very different from what you're proposing, IIUC.
