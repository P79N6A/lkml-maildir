_Not_ at all ! You misunderstood my answer it seems, as what I
wanted to say so far was the need to build a new full ACL
file system (ext-2 derivative is an option).As a fact,
that concept shipped under VMS fitted perfectly that OS 
because other resources worked the same way...Do you have
any project to change IPC's UGO approach ?
The support of ACLs under one isolated file system means several
things for me : you can turn the stuff the way you want to fit
ACL concept and you won't break ext-2 usual stable partitions.
IMHO you can bring up new _features_ in Linux kernel
(fortunately) even if it's not kernel cohesive but it must 
come in one separated conceptual block (take a look at my
VMS'IPC prepatch to see what I mean).

Of course.
