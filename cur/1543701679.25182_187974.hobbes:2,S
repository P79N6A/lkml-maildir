Hi.  I've seen this too.  It happens when I run ls -al or ls -alR on an
uncached directory (usually after boot).  If the directory is big, I
wait 3-4 seconds for a listing.  I've updated bash with yum (currently
I'm using bash 2.05b on Fedora with 2.6.1-pre1).  It probably doesn't
help that my drives are slow (5400 rpm).  Doing regression performance
testing on the drives using hdparm helps, but the problem still exists.
