But it *did* work. Userspace could ask the device to suspend, and (in 
general) that would result in the device going into a lower power state. 
You've broken that without providing an alternative.

We seem to be arguing at cross purposes here. I've absolutely no 
objection to this approach in the long run, just as I've got no 
objection to flying cars or food pills or moon pods. When these things 
exist, the world will indeed be a glorious place. But that doesn't 
justify me slashing your tyres, poisoning your crops or setting fire to 
whatever the real-world analogue of a moon pod is. I had something that 
worked. Now I don't, but instead have the promise that at some point 
I'll have something better. Understand why I'm a touch irritated?

Well, except I'm now burning an extra couple of watts of power. I 
consider that pretty broken.

I'm sorry, which bit of "Don't break userspace API without adequate 
prior warning and with a workable replacement" is difficult to 
understand?
