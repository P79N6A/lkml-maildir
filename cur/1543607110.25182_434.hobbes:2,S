I forgot to mention to disable interrupts after the SUSPEND_NOTIFY call.
The idea is to allocate all memory in the first pass, disable interrupts,
then save state. Would that work? Or, should some of the state saving take
place with interrupts enabled?

Yes, the resume sequence is broken into two stages:
	device_resume(RESUME_POWER_ON);
	/* enable interrupts */
	device_resume(RESUME_RESTORE_STATE);
Do you see a need to break it up further?
