Hello once again!
Here is a little bit more information on my issue with slowlaris and
knfs 2.6.21-rc4/5 (actually appears in 2.4.20.x).  Running this from
the client (x.org source code):
> ls -l xc/lib/Xmu/Xct.h
-rw-rw-r-- 1 phy bdf 0 2006-01-09 06:59 xc/lib/Xmu/Xct.h
> file xc/lib/Xmu/Xct.h
xc/lib/Xmu/Xct.h:       cannot read: Is a directory
> rm -rf xc/lib/Xmu/Xct.h
rm: cannot remove `xc/lib/Xmu/Xct.h': Not owner
> uname -a
SunOS mm3 5.10 Generic_118855-14 i86pc i386 i86pc Solaris
>chmod 777 xc/lib/Xmu/Xct.h
> rm -rf xc/lib/Xmu/Xct.h
rm: cannot remove `xc/lib/Xmu/Xct.h': Not owner
>
I would think the file would not be directory and if I tried to remove
it, I should be able as owner and permissions are correct.  This is on
a solaris 10 on intel, but I also see this problem on solaris 8, 9 and
10 on sparc.  Again, AIX5303 and 04 and all linux clients (2.4.x,
2.6.x) seem to be fine.
The file server is a dual dual core Opteron running 2.6.21-rc4+5 (but
also see this problem with 2.6.20.x), knfsd, XFS file system on LVM2
partition, on a 3Ware 9650 14 disk RAID 10.  Using nfs-1.0.12 and
LVM2.0.22 (?).
Also posting to LKML.
Any help is greatly appreciated.
TIA,
Phy

Subject: Issues with 2.6.21-rc4/5 and slowlaris 8
Hello,
I am having some issues with slowlaris 8 sparc and linux 2.6.21-rc4/5
(actually, 2.6.20.x as well) with directory permissions.  The client
is the slowlaris box mounting a file system (XFS, LVM, DM, 3Ware 9650)
from the linux box.  I extract some files from a tar ball and then try
to delete them, I get permission denied, however, the files are owned
by my uid and the file permissions are 775.  Any help figuring this
out would be most welcome.  I can provide plenty of debugging if
needed.
TIA!
Phy
