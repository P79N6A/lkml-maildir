After reviewing the arp.c file, I made a couple of changes.  I fixed the
ip.ip.ip.ip0xNN breakage and also changed the printing routine.  Since
the ARP mask is not implemented in the /proc file, I changed the length
formatting of it and the following dev->name entry.
e.g.:
-            "     %-17s %s\n",
+            "     %s %-16s\n",
devname is 16 bytes long, 17 isn't necessary as there is already a
space.  That is the last item.  The first is always "*" in /proc/net/arp
and doesn't need formatting.  The mask entry is currently "*" and this
format string will need changing once the u32 mask value is implemented.
On a side note, does it/will it be implemented in the future?
