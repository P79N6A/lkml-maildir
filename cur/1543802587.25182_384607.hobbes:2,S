Linus does a totally different thing from me.
He reverts about one patch a month.  I drop tens a day.
He never _alters_ patches.  2.6.15-mm1 had about 200 patches which modify
earlier patches and which get rolled up into the patch-which-they-modify
before going upstream.
He never alters the order of patches.

Ah.  If you're suggesting that the -mm git tree have _patches_ under git,
and the way of grabbing the -mm tree is to pull everything and to then
apply all the patches under the patches/ directory then yeah, that would
work.
But my tree at any random point in time is a random piece of
doesn't-even-compile-let-alone-run crap, believe me.  Often not all the
patches even apply.  I don't think there's much point in exposing people to
something like that.
