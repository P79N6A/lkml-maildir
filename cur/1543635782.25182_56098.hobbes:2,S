Indeed, this is used for a variety of reasons:
1) Systems with both on-motherboard and add-in disk controllers which share
a driver, where you really need the on-motherboard controller to appear
first before any add-in cards.  aacraid driver in 2.4.x does this today.
2) Systems with both an older and newer add-in card which share a driver,
where the older (original) card has your boot disks, and any newer card
would get added for adding more storage later.  megaraid driver in
2.4.x/2.5.x does this today.
In both these cases, the pci_find_device() functions use an explict ordering
to make it far more likely we can still boot the system after adding new
hardware.  Unless/until there's a method for telling the kernel/modules that
a particular device is the boot device (ala BIOS EDD 3.0 if vendors were to
get around to implementing such) explict ordering in the drivers is the only
way we can build complex storage solutions and boot reliably.
Thanks,
Matt
