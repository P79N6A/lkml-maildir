Works fine here. Better than mainline. I can listen music from a video dvd 
while browsing with opera and amule running. In mainline (CFQ scheduler) i 
cannot do this because the sound skips badly. With RSDL there are very few 
skips, they are shorter and related on a particular event - in this case 
clicking a link in Opera browser.
Now system info:
CPU:  AMD Duron 700 MHz, MB chipset VIAKT133 (UDMA 66), memory 384172 kB 
(reported by /proc/meminfo).
Kernel is 2.6.21-rc3 #3 PREEMPT with RSDL 0.30 patches.
Thanks
Bye

P.S. As a side note: in mainline the cpu was distributed almost equally 
between different tasks which favoured the big cpu hogs (amule and opera). 
Now, in RSDL the mplayer gets a bigger stake
