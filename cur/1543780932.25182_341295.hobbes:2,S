I hate to say this, but you are right.  Can you suggest a way around this 
problem?  Perhaps arranging things so that the devlist_mutex is held only 
during the actual __device_bind_driver call and not during probe...  But 
there are so many tricky interactions and possible races that this 
requires a lot of thought.  I'll get back to you.
