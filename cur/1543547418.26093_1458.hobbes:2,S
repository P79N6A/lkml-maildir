I missed the beginning of this thread, but I can guess what's going on
here...
According to the ORBS database, rr.com specifically requested all automated
testing for open mail relays to stop.  As such, ORBS lists all IPs in the
rr.com domain as 127.0.0.4, which is their code for "manually entered".
Unfortunately, nobody seems to check these codes -- they only check for
their presence in the database.
If you would like rr.com to change their policy, the listed contact is
mherrick@va.rr.com.  Note that RoadRunner appears to admit that they have
open relays, but 'demanded' [word used by ORBS, not me] that all ORBS
testing (which would provide for more selective blocking only of the actual
bad machines) be stopped.
