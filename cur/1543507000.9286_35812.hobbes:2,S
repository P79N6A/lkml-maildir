> What does the "bottom half" mean in linux?
It's the part right below the "top half".  :-)  j/k
It's the part of an interrupt handler that runs with interrupts enabled.
The "top half" runs first with interrupts disabled (not something you want
to do for long) and tries to just what is immediately necessary/expedient,
then schedules the rest of the work for the "bottom half" to do later.
Look here for more explanation:
