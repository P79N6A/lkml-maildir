Agreed.

This is a PCI fixup, the driver shouldn't have to worry about this..

huh?  The two steps do not occur simultaneously.  The enabling should
occur first, at which point the BARs should be useable.  The remapping
occurs after that.  If the BARs are not usable after remapping, that is
a PCI quirk that needs to be added to the list [probably].
