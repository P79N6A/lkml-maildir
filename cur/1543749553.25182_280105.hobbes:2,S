Subject: RFC: [2.6 patch] let BLK_DEV_UB depend on EMBEDDED

I've already seen people crippling their usb-storage driver with 
enabling BLK_DEV_UB - and I doubt the warning in the help text added 
after 2.6.9 will fix all such problems.
Is there except for kernel size any good reason for using BLK_DEV_UB 
instead of USB_STORAGE?
If not, I'd suggest the patch below to let BLK_DEV_UB depend
on EMBEDDED.
