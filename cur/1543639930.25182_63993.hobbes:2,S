Subject: [2.4.20-pre2] CPiA kernel panic
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I just built the new 2.4.20-pre2. 
Under Multimedia devices / Video for Linux I included:
        * CPiA Video for Linux 
        * CPiA USB lowlevel support
When booting, I got this:
V4L-Driver for Vision CPiA based cameras v0.7.4
usb.c: registered new driver cpia
Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address
00000000 printing eip:
c0119e3c
* pde=00000000
Oops: 0002
EIP: 0010: [<c0119e3c>] Not tainted
EFLAGS 00010002
After this there was additional failure information (eax, ebx, ecx, edx,
esi, edi, ebp, esp), ds: 0018 es: 0018 ss: 0018, Process swapper (pid: 1,
stackpage=C12d7000), Stack, Call trace, Code, and finally,
<o> Kernel panic: Attempted to kill init!
No error log appears to have been written; I copied this down.
I then rebuilt the kernel without the CPiA driver and the USB low-level support and the system works fine.
I had the same experience in the fall, building with 2.4.16 for an i586.
I tried to get something useful from Oops but failed.
Cheers,
Peter
