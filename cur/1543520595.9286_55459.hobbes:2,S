Subject: [OT] There is indeed a lurker here harvesting addresses and spamming instantly [the bait was taken]
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

One or more of the following endpoints are likely subscribed to
linux-kernel, and generating Auto-response mails within 24 hours to posters
(first time it occurred within a few minutes, second time it occurred a few
hours later).  He might only spam addresses he hasn't seen before - but
still, it's rude and obnoxious all the same.
<marketingtools.net> (spam advertised address is:
infotips@marketingtools.net)
mext.clubinter.net (probably just the MTA relay victim, but who knows if
it's a spamhaus)
uninet.net.mx (only dynip# listed in headers)
getresponse.com (spam-advertised address is: eb-amm1001@getresponse.com)
On a closer inspection of the headers of the spam, his lame software even
admits to auto-responding to my posting:
X-Mailer: Calypso Version 3.00.03.02 (2)
X-Auto-Response-To: <000701bf50e7$90408c40$8aa625cb@durian.paypc.com>
Amazing.
