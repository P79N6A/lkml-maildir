I have an 8-way SMP system which doesn't compile the 2.5.x kernel.
If I turn off CONFIG_SCSI_IPS it compiles fine. It also worked
fine with 2.4.x. 
Here is the error:
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/home/hlinder/src/linux-2.5.5/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -Wno-trigraphs -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -fno-strict-aliasing -fno-common -pipe -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 -march=i686   -DKBUILD_BASENAME=ips  -c -o ips.o
