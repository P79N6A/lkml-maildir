I explained this.  The fileid and the generation count along
with the file system id will uniquely identify the file.

Nice try.  Wrong.  Try a different rationalization.

This isn't a new idea and has been implemented on a variety of
different systems.

I didn't think that we were talking about old servers and other
OS's.  My concern at the moment is Linux and the changes being
made to it.

And the solution is limiting.  It is not scalable nor particularly
interesting to anyone interested in security.  Unless there is a
way of limiting access to a particular set of files, then it is
not generally useful outside of hackers or perhaps small groups
of users not concerned about too many aspects of security.
I am not interested in an extended discussion of this topic.
    Thanx...
