Subject: make bzlilo seems to ignore non-standard kernel path in lilo.conf (/boot)

Hello,
when I tried to get rid of the problem I wrote about two days ago in 
this list I compiled the kernel several times but unfortunately it was
not installed correctly by the make target bzlilo.
Is it possible to add a parse of /etc/lilo.conf to this target to look
for the path the compiled kernels are located (in my case it was
/boot but make bzlilo put the new kernel in / so it was not installed
by running lilo afterwards)?
This happened to the last 2.2.x kernels I did not try the 2.4.x
series yet.
Greetings,
Olaf
