Hello All,
	I am going rounds with a sub-contractor of ours about what options
should and should not be compiled into the kernel in order for
Hyperthreading to work.  Can anyone make any suggestions and comments to the
options (below)  that I am planning on enforcing:
	MSR
	MTRR
	CPUID
	Lilo.conf : acpismp=force?? 
	Are the following worth any thing of value to Hyperthreading:
	Microcode
	ACPI
TIA
