When you removed the kernel rpms, it removes the symlinks in /usr/include,
try this:
ln -s  /usr/src/linux/include/linux /usr/include/linux
ln -s /usr/src/linux/include/asm-i386 /usr/include/asm
ln -s /usr/src/linux/include/scsi /usr/include/scsi
That should fix you up. There used to be a note about this in the README,
but I don't see it anymore.
