No, the on-disk format in ext3 does not change, with the exception of
the addition of the journal inode.  You can migrate between ext2 and
ext3 without a reformat.  We'd lose all of that unless we could find
spare space (hah!) in the ext2 inode in which to store the high bits
of the link count in a compatible manner.
