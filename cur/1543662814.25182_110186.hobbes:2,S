When I tried to "make bzImage" the 2.5.53 it gave me the following error
In file included from include/linux/spinlock.h:13,
                 from include/linux/mmzone.h:8,
                 from include/linux/gfp.h:4,
                 from include/linux/slab.h:14,
                 from include/linux/proc_fs.h:5,
                 from init/main.c:15:
include/linux/kernel.h:10:20: stdarg.h: No such file or directory
I am using gcc-3.2. And I did make menuconfig with default settings.
