Poll in 2.6.0; when a driver routine calls poll_wait()
it returns <<immediately>> to somewhere in the
kernel, then waits for my wake_up_interuptible(), before
returning control to a user sleeping in poll(). This means
that the user gets the wrong poll return value! It
doesn't get the value it was given as a result of the
interrupt, but the value that existed (0) before the
interrupt occurred.
Poll should not return from poll_wait() until it gets
a wake_up_interruptible() call. The wait variable,
info->pwait, below, has been initialized by executing
init_waitqueue_head(&info->pwait) in the initialization
code. This code works in 2.4.24.
What do I do to make it work in 2.6.0 and beyond? There
are no hints in the 2.6 drivers as they all seem to be
written like this and they presumably work.

{
    spin_lock(&info->lock);
    DEB(printk(KERN_INFO"%s : Interrupt!\n", devname));
    info->poll_flag |= POLLIN|DEF_POLL;
    wake_up_interruptible(&info->pwait);
    spin_unlock(&info->lock);
}
/*-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=*/
/*

static size_t poll(struct file *fp, struct poll_table_struct *wait)
{
    size_t poll_flag;
    size_t flags;
    DEB(printk(KERN_INFO"%s : poll called\n", devname));
    poll_wait(fp, &info->pwait, wait);
    lockit(TRUE, &flags);
    poll_flag = info->poll_flag;
    info->poll_flag = 0;
    lockit(FALSE, &flags);
    DEB(printk(KERN_INFO"%s : poll returns\n", devname));
    return poll_flag;
}
