When attempting to boot 2.2.10-ac10 on an AMD K6/233 w/FIC PA-2007
motherboard and a generic NCR810 based card, I get the following messages
during boot:
sym53c810a-0: script cmd = f31c004
regdump: da 10 80 03 47 00 00 1f 71 0e 00 aa 80 00 0a 00
sym53c810a-0:00: ERROR (c0:0) (e-aa-0) (013) @ (script 68:1e000000)
sym53c810a-0: restart (scsi reset)
(Anything that doesn't make sense there can be attributed to a typo
and/or mistake transcribing from the screen :-)
This same machine works perfectly with 2.0.37 (and all previous 2.0.x
kernels for that matter).  Here are the compile options:
CONFIG_SCSI_NCR53C7xx=m
# CONFIG_SCSI_NCR53C7xx_sync is not set
CONFIG_SCSI_NCR53C7xx_FAST=y
CONFIG_SCSI_NCR53C7xx_DISCONNECT=y
CONFIG_SCSI_NCR53C8XX=m
CONFIG_SCSI_NCR53C8XX_DEFAULT_TAGS=8
CONFIG_SCSI_NCR53C8XX_MAX_TAGS=4
CONFIG_SCSI_NCR53C8XX_SYNC=10
# CONFIG_SCSI_NCR53C8XX_PROFILE is not set
# CONFIG_SCSI_NCR53C8XX_IOMAPPED is not set
# CONFIG_SCSI_NCR53C8XX_SYMBIOS_COMPAT is not set
I tried both drivers (BTW, why are there two?) with the same effect.  The
SCSI devices are:
Attached devices: 
Host: scsi0 Channel: 00 Id: 00 Lun: 00
  Vendor: SEAGATE  Model: ST32430N         Rev: 0510
  Type:   Direct-Access                    ANSI SCSI revision: 02
Host: scsi0 Channel: 00 Id: 02 Lun: 00
  Vendor: SEAGATE  Model: ST1480   SUN0424 Rev: 7516
  Type:   Direct-Access                    ANSI SCSI revision: 02
Any ideas?  I briefly looked through the source code for both drivers but
couldn't find anything that would possibly explain this problem.
Thanks in advance,
Mike.
