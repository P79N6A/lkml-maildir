_INTERNAL is basically the same thing in effect anyway. It clearly states
the symbol is an internal part of a GPL product so it would be very hard
for someone to argue their work was not derivative if they used one

BTW thinking about compatibility. There is no reason the view insmod sees
can't remain the same. EXPORT_SYMBOL_INTERNAL can just do the same symbol
magic as before.
It also helps me with the kernel-doc stuff if EXPORT_SYMBOL_INTERNAL is
used and in 2.5 we go mark most of the random internal kernel symbols with it
because we can begin to generate complete docs of public export interfaces
and their functionality
