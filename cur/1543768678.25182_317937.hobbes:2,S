Ok, I'll bite.  Hopefully I'm not the only one tripping on shoe laces...
Here is what I did -- what am I doing wrong?
Following is using cogito 0.10:
REPO=rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pubs/scm/linux/kernel/git/jgarzik/netdev-2.6.git
cg-clone ${REPO}
.... get coffee, etc. ... come back and I have a netdev-2.6 tree ...
cg-branch-add wifi ${REPO}#wifi
cg-update wifi
.... connects and attempts to download but fails out with:
----------------
receiving file list ... done
client: nothing to do: perhaps you need to specify some filenames or the
--recursive option?
rsync: link_stat
"/scm/linux/kernel/git/jgarzik/netdev-2.6.git/heads/wifi" (in pub)
failed: No such file or directory (2)
rsync error: some files could not be transferred (code 23) at main.c(653)
receiving file list ... done
client: nothing to do: perhaps you need to specify some filenames or the
--recursive option?
cg-pull: unable to get the head pointer of branch wifi
----------------
Should it be trying to get 'wifi' from ...netdev-2.6.git/branches (vs.
heads)? 
Tool problem, user problem, complete lack of knowledge re: git and
cogito, or a combination of the above?
Thanks,
James
