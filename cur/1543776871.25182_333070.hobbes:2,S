Mostly my argument is that all technical arguments aside, it's crazy to
change this in the middle of a stable kernel series.
My other objection is that 90% of the arguments for HZ=250 are based on
battery life.  But most Linux systems still don't run on batteries, so I
object to having to take a performance hit (a latency hit, which is the
same as performance for multimedia apps) for their sake.
Tickless + sub HZ timers is a win for everyone, the multimedia people
get better latency, and the laptop people get to run longer.
I guess CONFIG_HZ makes sense if the tickless solutions are not going to
be ready anytime soon.  But I don't see the problem with leaving the
default at 1000HZ and letting the laptop users lower it.
