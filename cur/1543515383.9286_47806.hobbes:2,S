Kernel crash collecting and analysis tools, developed by Mission Critical Linux,
are being made available under the GPL.  These tools are still under development, but we are
making them available now to get feedback.  They may be found at the web site,
www.missioncriticallinux.com under the Developer's Forum -> Downloads section.
The crash analysis tool may be used on a live system or a core file created by the collection
facility.  The analysis tool, which works for kernel versions 2.2.x and 2.3.x, features nice
structure prints, stack traces, task listing, and context setting.  Soon to come will be
real parameter values for the stack traces.  See the readme in the tar file for details.
The core collection facility produces a basic compressed core file.  It is basic
in the sense that only a non-exception, non-interrupt level panic results in a saved core.
The next version of the core collection facility will resolve these problems.
The download available today is for kernel version 2.2.5.  We will be updating the site
with downloads for later kernel versions shortly.
