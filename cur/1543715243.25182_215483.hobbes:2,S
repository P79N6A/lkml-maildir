Yes it doesn't modulate indefinitely, it means that your cooling is
inadequate.

If i recall correctly it's hardware set, i'm not sure if BIOSes can modify
that these days. One thing you may want to note is that in the modulated
state the processor doesn't process interrupts and runs at a 50% clock
duty cycle. So there is a large performance loss when its running in this
mode. You really should consider looking into your cooling...
