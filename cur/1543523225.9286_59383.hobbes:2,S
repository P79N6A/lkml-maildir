Hi,
Here are some numbers.  My (java) application is moving lots of data thru
a pipeline, where each stage of the pipeline is a thread.  The code for each
stage is small (1-20K) and the support class are about 20K each (plus netrexx 
and java).  This implies that most of code should be cachable.  Another point,
all the locks are encapsulated in the support class(s).  When using my stuff
you do not normally have to worry about locking. 
In the example run below I am looking to see just how fast data is moved in the 
pipeline.  Normally there will only be one thread that is runnable.  Suspect that
the goodness check in wakeup is helping me.  In any case I see slightly better
performance with Davide's patch applied.
The stats include the run of my test pipeline.  The numbers in it are in ms.  
I have also included vmstat output, in the vmstat you can see fewer runnable
processes and more context switches with the patch applied.
I would be very interested to see a SAP benchmark run with and without this
patch.
