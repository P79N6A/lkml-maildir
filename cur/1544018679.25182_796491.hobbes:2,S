Nvidia Tesla C1060 has no output, so I was using intel motherboard
garphics, when I disable intel motherboard graphics adapter
installation processes able to find nvidia graphics adapter and build
the nvidia module.
But now I got another problem I use various git kernels trees, so I
need to build these modules for each kernel tree. And seems nvidia is
not disclosing the source code for Nvidia Telsa Series module :-(
