Oh yea, the vDSO stuff slipped in after I last tested the ppc64 bits, so
I wouldn't be surprised if that's broken. For now I'm just disabling the
vsyscall/fsyscall/vDSO bits on the arches that support it until I get a
generic interface setup that would allow it to be consistent with the
new time infrastructure. Hopefully I'll have that done (I'm targeting
x86-64 atleast) by the next release. 
thanks
