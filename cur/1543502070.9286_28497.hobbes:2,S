Well what kinda hosts do You have behind your gateway? I've a DNS, which does 53:UDP -> 53:UDP, which DID NOT work at all after the first disconnect of my ISDN card. I had to put a second 
cache only DNs on my gateway to work around that...
And just to head off comments on me using a SuSE modified kernel which came with my 6.1, I tried every kernel from 2.2.5 to 2.2.10-ac2...
