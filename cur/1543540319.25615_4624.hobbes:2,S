I'll do it, indeed. Moreover, since we don't copy ->s_flags to ->i_flags
anymore (since 2.1.late) _and_ the only bits shared with ->s_flags and
set in ->i_flags are MS_SYNCHRONOUS and MS_NOATIME I think that the right thing
is
	a) remove check in ->i_flags from IS_FOO for values of FOO other than
SYNC and NOATIME - it always gives false, anyway.
	b) Define S_SYNC and S_NOATIME and let ext2 set them (in ->i_flags,
that is) in places where it currently sets MS_SYNCHRONOUS and MS_NOATIME.
	c) let IS_SYNC and IS_NOATIME check for MS_FOO in ->s_flags and S_FOO
in ->i_flags.
	d) forget about the magical dependencies between ->s_flags and ->i_flags
layouts.
