I was afraid it was when I first saw it but I couldn't reproduce (and
still can't).

For some reason your compilers inline heavier than mine do, which makes
this:
kmem_cache_alloc
sys_epoll_create	(__builtin_return_address(0))
system_call		(__builtin_return_address(1))
			(__builtin_return_address(2))
and off the stack we go...
I guess it was naive to even try to use this for more than the first
caller, sorry. Please throw that thing away and I'll do some backtracing
similar to CONFIG_PAGE_OWNER
