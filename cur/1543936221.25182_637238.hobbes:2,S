I'm just taking a closer look at things now that I've recovered from
spending a day in a nice, loud server room and things are popping up
that make me wonder if 2.6.22.15 is just too old for this motherboard.

As it should be. Dual core.

have one core up.

Eek! This doesn't look so good.
So I now have a nice, brand new, spiffy motherboard and a dual core
cpu... with one core not in use, a weird panic relating to CPUs and
kernel processes hung in D state. Whee! :)
