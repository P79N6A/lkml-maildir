The only reason I wrote some messages to this theme is that on
my point of view the using of tags like "v2.6.21-git16" would be
convenient. But that should be Linus' decision (thanks to David
for proposed solution). Anyway if Linus doesn't want to keep
a such tags in hisown tree I prefer to do the same ;)
