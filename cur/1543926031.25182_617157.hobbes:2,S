Hm, I've attached the two patches that I have right now in the -stable
tree so far (still have over 100 patches to go, so I might not have
gotten to them yet if you have sent them).  These were sent to me by
Andrew on their way to Linus.  if I should drop either one, or add
another one, please let me know.
thanks,

patch 85bfb4da8cad483a4e550ec89060d05a4daf895b in mainline.
As page->index is unsigned, this all becomes an unsigned comparison, which
 almost always returns an error.

patch 4ae3f847e49e3787eca91bced31f8fd328d50496 in mainline.
ops_complete_biofill() runs outside of spin_lock(&sh->lock) and clears the
'pending' and 'ack' bits.  Since the test_and_ack_op() macro only checks
against 'complete' it can get an inconsistent snapshot of pending work.
Move the clearing of these bits to handle_stripe5(), under the lock.
