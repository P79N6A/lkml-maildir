Subject: Bug report: 2.2.11 Makefile
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I don't know if anyone's noticed this Makefile
bug/feature or not.
I downloaded 2.2.11 & ran:
make xconfig 
  - enabled "set version information on all symbols
    and modules" option. didn't change anything else
make dep
make clean
make bzImage
built fine.
ran:
make xconfig
  - disabled smp support option. didn't change
    anything else
make dep
make clean
make bzImage
build failed.
It appears that the include/linux/modules
directory is not being cleaned at all so
mangled versions of smp & up kernel symbols
are clashing. ( same problem exists in 2.2.5
as well ).
cheers
