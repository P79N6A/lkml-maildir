Greetings;
I bought, 3 or so years back, a 1394 controller, thinking
that maybe it had a chance to become a standard, like USB
is now.
lspci -vv reports this:
00:0b.0 FireWire (IEEE 1394): Texas Instruments FireWire Controller (rev 01) (prog-if 10 [OHCI])
        Subsystem: Texas Instruments: Unknown device 8010
        Control: I/O- Mem+ BusMaster+ SpecCycle- MemWINV- VGASnoop- ParErr- Stepping- SERR- FastB2B-
        Status: Cap+ 66Mhz- UDF- FastB2B- ParErr- DEVSEL=medium >TAbort- <TAbort- <MAbort- >SERR- <PERR-
        Latency: 32 (750ns min, 1000ns max), cache line size 08
        Interrupt: pin A routed to IRQ 11
        Region 0: Memory at e3007000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=2K]
        Region 1: Memory at e3000000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=16K]
        Capabilities: [44] Power Management version 1
                Flags: PMEClk- DSI- D1- D2- AuxCurrent=0mA PME(D0-,D1-,D2-,D3hot+,D3cold-)
                Status: D0 PME-Enable- DSel=0 DScale=0 PME-
Is there any chance that this card can actually be used with modern devices?
Or should I bin it and save the couple of watts its burning?

Cheers, Gene
