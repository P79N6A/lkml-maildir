I guess I don't have a problem with that as long as I don't have to
chase the bugs.  
If I do have to chase the bugs I would rather call the shutdown methods
and just say things don't _yet_ work in cases where it is not safe
to call them.
I guess I just like to be easily to explain what does not work _yet_.
With running at the same addresses we also have a rogue cpu problem as
well.  If we don't kill the cpu before the new kernel starts what happens
if it starts executing some random bit of the new code...
