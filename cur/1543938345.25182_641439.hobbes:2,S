I added some code to e1000_clean_rx_irq() to track rx_fifo drops, total 
packets received, and an accurate timestamp.
If rx_fifo errors changed, it would dump the information.

I added some instrumentation to take timestamps in __do_softirq() as 
well.  Based on these timestamps, I can see the following code sequence:
2374604616 usec, start processing softirqs in __do_softirq()
2374610337 usec, log values in e1000_clean_rx_irq()
2374611411 usec, log values in e1000_clean_rx_irq()
In between the successive calls to e1000_clean_rx_irq() the rx_fifo 
counts went up.
Does anyone have any patchsets to track down what softirqs are taking a 
long time, and/or who's disabling softirqs?
