Hi Jesse/Grant,
May be my response to Grant got lost .. anyway, here it is again.

The original mod, we took out the static from pci_root_ops() so that we can use
it in io_init.c.  We thought that would be the cleanest.
We do not want to change pci_raw_ops().  It is doing exactly what we need, now
that sn platform has the support for SAL pci reads and writes support.

Probably not clear to all:
+/*
+ * sn_pci_fixup_bus() - This routine sets up a bus's resources
+ * consistent with the Linux PCI abstraction layer.
+ */
+static void sn_pci_fixup_bus(int segment, int busnum)
+{
+       int status = 0;
+       int nasid, cnode;
+       struct pci_bus *bus;
+       struct pci_controller *controller;
+       struct pcibus_bussoft *prom_bussoft_ptr;
+       struct hubdev_info *hubdev_info;
+       void *provider_soft;
+
+       status =
+           sal_get_pcibus_info((u64) segment, (u64) busnum,
+                               (u64) ia64_tpa(&prom_bussoft_ptr));
+       if (status > 0) {
+               return;         /* bus # does not exist */
+       }
+
+       prom_bussoft_ptr = __va(prom_bussoft_ptr);
+       controller = sn_alloc_pci_sysdata();
+       if (!controller) {
+               BUG();
+       }
+
+       bus = pci_scan_bus(busnum, &sn_pci_root_ops, controller);
+       if (bus == NULL) {
+               return;         /* error, or bus already scanned */
+       }
The sal_get_pcibus_info() will fail if we do not find that bus number.  If it
fails, we do not call pci_scan_bus()
