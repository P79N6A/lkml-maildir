:-)
I'd really like eye-candy code to be gone. Its long, and its not worth
the trouble.

No, this was actually with unmodified swsusp2. [I'm not sure if
highmem was enabled at that point. I do not think it was.]

I agree that NOFREEZE is better name. Try submitting separate patch to
rename it; if it gets rejected, modify swsusp2 to use IOTHREAD name...

Not enough comments, then :-). [I wish I had followed swsusp2
development more closely, but I guess its too late for that by now.]

I'm looking forward to better swsusp2.
