Yes, exactly. Think about email servers with lots of dirty files.

list_heads are OK if we use them for one and only function. We have
been trying to jam too much into s_dirty in the past.  Grabbing a
refcount could be better than locking - anyway if we split the
functions today, it would be easy to replace the list_heads one by
one in the future.
