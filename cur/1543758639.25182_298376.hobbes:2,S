Damn
Having to configure the interfaces using bonding was not really the answer I 
was expecting.
I did not think linux would be that rigid.  I figured if poodoze is able to do 
it (seamlessly mind you), surely linux (with some tinkering) would be able to 
do it also.
The goal was to have the networking on the laptop work as perfectly as 
crapdoze does.  
Perhaps I should and this topic to my list of software issues that no-one else 
cares about. "man that list is getting big".  maybe one day I'll develop the 
balls to get deep into the code.
