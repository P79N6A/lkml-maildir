	Why don't you just recompile the Wireless Tools (iwconfig and
friends) for 64 bits ?
	The source of Wireless Tools should be 64 bit clean (was
working on Alpha), and I don't think it's worth adding a whole pile of
cruft in the kernel when it's used by a few system utilities that you
can simply recompile. Personally, I expect every distribution to ship
the base system compiled natively.
	With regards to this specific problem, just return an
error. The Wireless Tools should gracefully handle it and report to
the user. I would appreciate if you would use a "distinctive" error
message, such as ENOEXEC, so that I can point users in the correct
direction.
	Just food for thought... I you think the wireless ioctls are
bad, there is worse. The linux-wlan-ng driver defines it's own driver
specific ioctls, and it has 3 times the number of ioctls. Just for one
driver. And the ioctl format sometimes changes with revision.
	So, clearly you can't expect to deal with every ioctl under
the sun, that's just not practical.
	Have fun...
	Jean
