If we spinlock (and don't trylock as you're proposing) we'd have to do a 
double rq lock for each sibling. I guess half the time double_rq_lock will 
only be locking one runqueue... with 32 runqueues we either try to lock all 
32 or lock 1.5 runqueues 32 times... ugh both are ugly.

I'm still not sure that only doing trylock is adequate, and 
wake_sleeping_dependent is only called when a runqueue falls idle in 
schedule, not when it's busy so its cost (in my mind) is far less than 
dependent_sleeper.
