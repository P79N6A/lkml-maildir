You can "get" something without agreeing with it.

Not only are you offensive, but you're wrong.
In practise the difference to the user between systems with streamed files
and one like UNIX without streamed files is zero. The unstreamed system is
simply required to use a filename per fork, and operations that modify any
file must modify all forks appropriately.
This is harder if you're trying to preserve backwards compatiblity with an
army of programs which don't understand forks, but is trivial for a system
being designed from the "groundup" to be only accessed through a graphical
file manager. All GUI applications just need take care.
It doesn't even make the job any harder for the programmer. They just need
to use forked variants of common filesystem operations ie. frkopen().
Now you can argue that forked filesystems have other benefits (speed, code
size, simplicity) but the fundamental benefit is achievable on filesystems
without streamed files. Even things like locking and atomic operations are
not a hinderance with "faked" streamed files.

It's not a hack. It's just putting the code in userspace, not the kernel.

Is this really necessary?
