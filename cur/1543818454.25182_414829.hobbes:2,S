Swap file.

Ext3.
The kernel is 2.6.16-rc3-git2-ck1. There is -ck patch in it but I strongly 
hope that swap prefetch is not *that* buggy to cause such things... I am 
considering testing vanilla. Con CC'd.
The system is Athlon XP 2000MHz with 1GB of RAM and Samsung 80GB IDE hard 
drive.
The second run of swapon is very fast (like 2 seconds). So it looks like 
it has cached something in RAM?...
Thanks,
