No, it's not normal. It is long-standing bug - I think from 2.2 kernels. 
You know that without swap and with certain memory allocation strategy
(when process in a loop allocates one anonymous page, one file cache page
and again...) this bug can be triggered even when there is half memory
free.
Buddy allocator is broken - kill it. Or at least do not misuse it for
anything except kernel or driver initialization.
