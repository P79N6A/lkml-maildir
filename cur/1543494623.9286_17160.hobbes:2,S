;-/ I'm afraid that the whole scheme with calling iget() here is broken by
design. You can get out with this kludge in case of ext2, but for
NFS/NCPFS/SMBFS/CODA reexports, for anything FAT-derived, for ISOFS... Not
going to work. And even in case of ext2/ufs/sysvfs/minix it's a kludge.
I've played with that place of knfsd last two weeks and I have to agree
with Linus - iget() should be used only inside of UNIX-like filesystems
and only for regular lookups. Maybe we should give up on using inumber
here (we are using pair of inumbers anyway) and leave the decision re what
is proper fhandle to filesystem drivers. That would mean adding
dentry_to_fh and fh_to_dentry methods and dropping the corresponding code
from knfsd. If filesystem doesn't implement them - though luck, stale
dentry => stale fhandle. We can't do any better for ISOFS and friends
anyway.
