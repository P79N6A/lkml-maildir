I think the disabling of i8042 support might help.

That's what happens here, I think.

Yes.

Well, my theory is the following:
Without the patch, platform_finish() runs before the i8042's .resume() which is
done as though a real keyboard were present, but the ACPI magic is not done
and this confuses the heck out of the controller.  Still, it doesn't go mad at
this point just yet (it probably isn't fully functional either, although we
don't see that, because it's not really used), but next, during the subsequent
suspend, it gets poked while device_power_up() is running and goes belly
up.

I think the patch helps, because it makes the ACPI magic be done while the
i8042's .resume() is being executed.
Which makes me think the following patch might help:
