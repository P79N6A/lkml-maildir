I think Alan wanted the patch simply because he wants us to never be able
to generate a bogus config - so that you at config time _know_ that the
compile is going to finish. 
I agree with you that just silently defaulting to the PCI BIOS may not be
the right approach either. The "right" approach is probably to allow some
kind of "multi-radio-button" (or whatever they are called by GUI-geeks) 
config entry that forces one or more choices on you so that it's basically
impossible to have a PCI config that has no PCI method associated with it.
