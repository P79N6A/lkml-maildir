What is the parent PID for the defunct tasks?  zero?
<slaps head> swapper doesn't know how to reap children, and
AFAIK there's no way for a kernel thread to fully clean itself
up.  This is always done by the parent.
ho-hum.  Jeff, I think the best fix here is to bite the
bullet and write kernel_daemon(), which will delegate
thread creation to keventd, which is the only thing
we have which reaps zombies.  Any better ideas?
