I sent a patch a while ago that gets rid of the whole namespace walking
by making acpi_memoryhotplug an acpi device and making use of the .add
callback function and the acpi_bus_register_driver call.
I am not sure whether this is possible if you have multiple memory
devices, though (if not maybe it should be made possible?)...
Yasunori even tested the patch and sent an Ok:

If this is acceptable I can rebase the patch on a current kernel.
