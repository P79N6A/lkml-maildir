I read that line and enabling the compilation of the intelfb on x86_64
was only a simple try to see if it compiles. It doesn't and basically I
have no idea how to fix it.
The 915G (8086:2582) is supported by the driver in the latest vanilla
kernel. Look at intelfb.h file and then you will see that the comment
line in Kconfig is outdated. I also found a patch to support the 915GM
(8086:2592) and maybe a similar patch will make the 945 work with the
intelfb driver.

Marcel
