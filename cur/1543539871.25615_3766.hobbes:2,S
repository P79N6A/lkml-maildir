Petr,
Would you like some help with this?  I think I know what's happening,
but a bigger problem may be just what clients other than Linux are
sharing this box.  Both LONG and NFS namespaces should be returning the
right info from the server, but there are some **F_CKED** issues with
Novell's code page and Unicode support.  
Email me and I'll attempt to help.
:-)
Your friend,
Jeff
P.S.  The way I finally got around the POSIX problem you were helping me
with was to order the directory numbers from the master directory file
within each subdirectoy directory, then return the actual dir numbers as
f_pos (but they have to be ascending, so I order them in the dir hash). 
Works!
