Hi,
in patch-2.4.20 'static void amd_adv_spec_cache_disable(void)' was removed 
from arch/i386/kernel/setup.c.
I haven't found any patch on lkml posted that did this and it wasn't mentioned 
in 2.4.20's changelog.
Can someone point to a why this was removed, maybe a different fix since the 
one mentioned says "Short-term fix" or is it not needed anymore for some 
reason?
Bye,
Oliver
