Hi, David,
One little thing I noticed:
> + * @cred_kernel_act_as:
> + *	Set the credentials for a kernel service to act as (subjective context).
> + *	@cred points to the credentials structure to be filled in.
> + *	@service names the service making the request.
> + *	@daemon: A userspace daemon to be used as a base for the context.
> + *	@dentry: A file or dir to be used as a base for the file creation
> + *	  context.
> + *	Return 0 if successful.
The comment describes a "dentry" argument, but the actual function does
not have that argument.
