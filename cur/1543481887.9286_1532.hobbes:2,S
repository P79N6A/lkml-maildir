I take it that WinModems simply won't work under Linux? Is there any way
around this?
I recently sold a nice P2/300 to someone with a lucent 56k D/F/V pci
modem in it... which under windows loads as an lt winmodem...  I need to
get this guy up& running, and I wasn't aware of a winmodem compatability
issue.. Don't wanna have him return it cause of a silly modem ;)
Any Thoughts?
Thanks ;)
