Because the on-disc value is 16 bits, I suppose.
Actually, if you are looking at the one in journal.c, that probably doesn't
need the xchg() at all. There's a write-locked rwsem covering the region.

In many of the cases, there're spinlocks or semaphores covering the xchg(), so
those don't really need to be xchg calls, I suppose.

There is serialisation in the form of spinlocks and semaphores covering many
of the exchanges, but not all. I'm not entirely sure where I need memory
barriers - i386 doesn't really have them.
