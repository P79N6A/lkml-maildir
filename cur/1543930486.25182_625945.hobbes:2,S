Newly broken ones will be regressions.  How many do we fix by the
change?  On SATA, setting the correct transfer chunk size doesn't seem
to fix many.

We'll need to blacklist setting transfer chunk size, eek, and let's
leave that as the last resort and hope that we find the solution soon.
Blacklist takes time to develop and temporary blacklist for just one
release doesn't sound like a good idea.
