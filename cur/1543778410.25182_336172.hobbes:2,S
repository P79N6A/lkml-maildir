Hi,
The following two patches are necessary to prevent my box (Asus L5D) from
hanging solid during resume from disk.
The problem is that, apparently, some out-of-order interrupts may be
generated during resume and if some drivers do not call free_irq() on
suspend, these interrupts are mishandled.  For reference please see
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4416
and
http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=12448907
The first patch adds free_irq() and request_irq() to the suspend and resume
routines, respectively, in the snd_intel8x0 driver.
The second one adds basic suspend/resume support to the sk98lin driver.
Please consider for applying,
Rafael
