I'm currently working on a new pci bridge class framework for 2.6.  The most
significant change is that you will be able to bind to the bridge using a
"struct pci_driver".

At a glance it looks like it's because the array starts at 0.

I'm currently redesigning this to use a resource array in "struct device".

There are 4 on cardbus bridges.  In my implementation, they will probably not
be very order dependent.

Could you provide any additional details about this bridge?
Thanks,
