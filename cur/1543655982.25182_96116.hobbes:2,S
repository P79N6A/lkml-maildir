A co-worker of me once developed some patch to handle some weired
Point of Sale keyboards (with magnetic stripe reader and some lock and
so on). He did it by allowing additional modules to parse everything
what is coming from keyboard controller (through additionally hooked
modules) before sending "normal" keycaps events to userspace. An
application willing to get the extra data could fetch that from some
/dev/ice node. This could be generalized to send input API events. I'll
CC him to allow him to speak up.
