Hi all
i have a embedded monta vista linux running.
i have developed a ethernet driver.
Its working Ok,
But i am facing some problem with the throughput.
After a lot of observation ,
i observed that i am getting un-aligned addresses of the data payload
from the TCP/IP stack.because of this problem i always have to do
memcpy to a word aligned buffer,because of which throughput is reduced
significantly.
Does anybody has some solution for this.
Regards
conio
