All right, I'm not sure if I'm adding anything to the discussion or
not. I'm actually a bit more interested in how to debug this problem.
Hardware/Software:
Cyrix 6x86 166 MHz
2 3Com 509 card (pnp not turned on).
Eth0 -> cable modem
Eth1 -> Internal LAN hub
IDE, SCSI, 2 serial, 1 parallel port
1 pnp sound board.
Problem:
ftp slows to a halt most times. When ftp is halted all Inet traffic
grinds to a halt, no http response, no email (pop3), no news. If you
turn down Eth0 wait to a count of 10 turn up Eth0 you can then use
http, email and news. Try to restart ftp and you kill everything again.
I've also experienced memory failures (festival won't run) until I
kill X. I don't know if the 2 are related.
Notes:
We have been having problems with the local cable network with outages
and slow downs. It wasn't until I saw this thread that I did any further
investigation. It's beginning to happen all the time and think that it's
related to something that the local problems trigger.
BTW, mail is direct to the mail server, http generally is proxied (I
turn it off from time to time or use lynx). I can send files and receive
files with Netscape (http or ftp?) generally OK.
Any pointers would be nice.
