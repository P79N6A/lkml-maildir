Well, hell.  If the "/proc is a blight on the face of the planet" ranting that
I've been hearing is just about the *name* /proc, then let's separate the
name issue from the content issue.
The kind of non-per-process information that is now in /proc needs to still
be there for many purposes; autoconfiguration is the one that is bugging 
me right now, but cluster management is just as important.
If moving /proc/cpuinfo to /sys/cpuinfo means people will stop trying to make
the cpuinfo information go away, then By all means let's move it.
I want /sys/dmi, too.
I'm willing to write up a proposal for /sys that would migrate the `unclean'
/proc stuff over to ./sys, and I'm willing to write the kernel patches to
implement the renaming.
I'm motivated to attack this right now because it touches the work I'm
doing on kernel autoconfiguration.
