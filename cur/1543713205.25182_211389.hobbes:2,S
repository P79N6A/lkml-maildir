Agreed.

If you choose CONFIG_DEBUG_HIGHMEM, kmap_atomic does check that
kunmap_atomic was done last time, no need for additional counter.
Sorry, I've not made it clear.
kmap_atomic_to_page does not map anything, and doesn't need a
corresponding unmap operation.  It expects that you already did
a kmap_atomic (and that you will later do a kunmap_atomic), and
translates from the address returned by kmap_atomic to the address
of the relevant struct page.  You can certainly argue that it's
misleadingly named, but no better name springs to my mind.
