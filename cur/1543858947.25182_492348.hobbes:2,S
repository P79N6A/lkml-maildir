AFAIK, its kino is 0.9.3.  Ok, while kino is running I did a modprobe -rv 
dc1394 and it removed dv1394.ko and ohci1394.ko
Now when going to the capture screen is says the device /dev/raw1394 is 
gone or the kernel module isn't loaded.  raw1394 is still resident 
according to an lsmod, so I'm puzzled as to why the device was removed 
when the module is still present.  So I modprobe -rv raw1394 and it took 
out raw1394 and ieee1394, then reloaded raw1394 which loaded ieee1394.  
And kino is still without controls but does not now report the error at 
the bottom of its screen.  Quitting it and restarting it restores the 
error.  Then loading dv1394 also brings in ohci1394, and a recycle out and 
back to the capture window restored the controls.
So I removed dv1394, and reloaded only ohci1384, but an attempt to change 
screens in kino locked the box up tight, not even the x-clock in the 
right corner was running and I had to hard reset it.
With 4 modules to play with and 4!=15, its the lack of the dv1394 module 
that isn't exactly friendly, the other combo's just kill the controls.
AIUI, it *should* be ohci1394 handling the controls stuff, so this 
represents a bit of a puzzle.  Or the AIUI is wrong :)

Me too, but the whole combination does work.  Remove only dv1394=locked up 
machine & hardware reset.
I hope this is helpfull to the next step in your quest to get rid of 
dv1394.
