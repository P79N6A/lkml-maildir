The aoetools project at 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/aoetools/
includes the package vblade:
"This is a beta release of vblade, the virtual EtherDrive (R) blade.
The vblade is a program that makes a seekable file available over an
ethernet local area network (LAN) via the ATA over Ethernet (AoE)
protocol."
PS. This month's Linux Journal has an article about AoE.
