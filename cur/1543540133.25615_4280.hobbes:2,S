FHS also says that a distro should ship with nothing in the /usr/local
tree.
But the FHS also says you can't have things like /usr/apache.  But I find
that most useful, as deleting one directory removes all traces of the
program.  Large packages that would normally end up all over the place can
be contained (like X, which FHS does allow to have its own place under
/usr).

/lib/modules seems good enough.  But as somone else said, it might make
more sence to be /lib/kernel.  The one problem I see with this, is I
usually have a small(ish) root partition.  On any installation I've done
/lib has never had its own partition.  And on most, the root partition
hasn't been big enough to hold an unpacked kernel tree.
