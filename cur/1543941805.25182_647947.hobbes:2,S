That's pretty funny, I did pretty much the exact same thing last week!
The primary difference between yours and mine is that I used a more
private interface to signal a softirq raise on another CPU, instead of
allocating call data and exposing a generic interface. That put the
locking in blk-core instead, turning blk_cpu_done into a structure with
a lock and list_head instead of just being a list head, and intercepted
at blk_complete_request() time instead of waiting for an already raised
softirq on that CPU.
Didn't get around to any performance testing yet, though. Will try and
clean it up a bit and do that.
