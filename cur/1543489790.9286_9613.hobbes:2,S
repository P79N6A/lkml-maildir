Just patched the kernel to 2.2.3 and grabbed the uide patch. Preumably I
got the right one :) (uide 6.19 - no flash stuff)
Ran hdparm before connecting so as to get a nice, quiet system:
1001.root@kinder:/root>> hdparm -tT /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  1.26 seconds =101.59 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in 408.99 seconds = 0.16 MB/sec

Don't have this either but will get it ASAP and compile and run it.
If you know exactly wher eI can find the source, that would be helpful.
My primary concern atm tho is wehter or not I got the right patch
and if I set things up right. I have no file in /proc/ide that gives
the type of info you showed. Help?
