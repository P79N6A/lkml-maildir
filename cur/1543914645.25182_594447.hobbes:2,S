Subject: [PATCH] SCSI: trailing whitespace in Kconfig
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Applies after patch "SCSI: split Kconfig menu into two".
I didn't want to change whitespace in the portions that this patch
moved from drivers/scsi/Kconfig to drivers/scsi/Kconfig.lowlevel,
hence produced this follow-up.
