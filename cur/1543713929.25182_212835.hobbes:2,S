Good challenge.  I thought they were all over, but closer inspection
shows almost all seem safe.  I can't quite bring myself to say
"all are safe".  Most of them (e.g. in arch's flush_dcache_page)
look like they're called when we know there's a real file mapping
(might be truncated beneath us, but won't turn anon), and we could
BUG_ON(PageAnon(page)) - but I don't feel quite sure enough to do
that (nor to use straight page->mapping instead).

I'd expected set_page_dirty to be a problem (it often has been),
but failed to find a problematic instance: there's a nice habit
of doing the set_page_dirty before lowering mapcount.
The one instance I am still a little worried about is sync_page:
I didn't follow your argument above.  But I think I'm remembering
a time long past when there was code which did lock_page on a page
without holding a reference to that page (in which case it could
turn into something else by the time lock acquired); but we don't
do that now - find_lock_page is good, and you've put a good
BUG_ON(PageAnon(page)) into it.

As you say, it wouldn't be a problem anyway; but that one is perfectly
okay because it's before the page_remove_rmap, so it's either stably
PageAnon there, or stably !PageAnon.
There's an (I think) unstable one in refill_inactive_zone, below
the ancient FIXME, but again that's entirely safe because we don't
dereference mapping, and it doesn't matter if we sometimes make a
wrong decision.
I think, ignore my PageAnon barrier concern; but allow me
to say "I told you so" if we ever do find such a race.
