On a HP Proliant DL385 with Smart6i Controller 2.6.14-rc1-mm1 was unable 
to mount root although the device file existed and had the correct 
major/minor numbers. 2.6.13-vanilla was able to find and mount the very 
same root-device using the same config.
Root-device was the first partition the first SCSI disk exported as JBOD 
which in smart-controller terms means it is a raid0. /dev/cciss/c0d0p1
I was able to see the devices flying by during the booting of 
2.6.14-rc1-mm1 so the controller, its disks and partitions were 
recognized correctly, it was just unable to map the major/minor number 
to a device or partition.
best regards,
