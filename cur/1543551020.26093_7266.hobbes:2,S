the address for bug fixes for the net-tools is net-tools@lina.inka.de. Your
patch does not address the net-tool, therefore i cannot apply it. We will
see who feels responsible for adding it to the kernel source. Alexey? Andi?
Davem? Alan?
I dont think there is a workaround in the net tools possible,m since the
SIOCSIFDSTADDR which is dispateched to addrconf_set_dstaddr will use
__dev_get_by_name to find the device (i dont know what for) and that will
fail without your patch.
Do u think a workaround in the net-tools is possible? I'm a little bit
confused where exactly the call fails. Since creating a sit device and then
assigning a tunnel address does not work, eighter.
