Patience, please. We like to have some QA coverage on a changes that
affect the writeback path in such a subtle manner before saying it
is good to go. Just releasing the fix into the main tree would be
irresponsible as there is the real possibility of the fix causing
other subtle corruption problems.
The fact the fix Works For You doesn't mean it works for everyone so
we need to take the time to make sure the fix is correct rather than
doing a half-arsed job of it and potentially leaving a landmine that
explodes on the wider community after release.
That being said, the fix doesn't appear to have any landmines in
it so we'll be pushing it to Linus RSN...
Cheers,
Dave.
