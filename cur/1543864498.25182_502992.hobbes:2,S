Hi Martin,
I finally re-ran memtest86 on the machine since it began to have too
many different kind of errors (GPF, invalid instruction...). It turned
out that one of the memory modules was bad. I guess my brand new 
list_debug race condition debugger will be useful in the future, but not
now. :)
I'll remember to let memtest86 run a few hours more on my new machines
next time.
Mathieu
