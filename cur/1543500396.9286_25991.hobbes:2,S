Subject: [RFC] struct file handlinhg in ->poll()

	Linus, just a quick question: what is guaranteed about ->poll()
behaviour? Specifically, can it block before calling poll_wait()? Can it
block other than in poll_wait()?
	fcheck() usage in do_select() worries me - if ->poll() may block
before incrementing f_count we have a race on hands right now. Even if it
doesn't block we have an unpleasant problems on SMP. That is, we must
stop sys_close() from removing the file from ->files->fd[] at least for
the period between fcheck() and poll_wait() (or return from ->poll() if it
never calls poll_wait()). Right now it's done with the big lock. Not nice.
Doing that with spinlock (rwlock, actually) might be better, but
__pollwait() may block, AFAICS.
	What do you think about replacing fcheck() with fget(); ->poll();
fput();? Are there any reasons not to do it? That would be the simplest
way, IMHO.
