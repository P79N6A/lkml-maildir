Most appreciated. I will apply, I've been slow fixing shawn4 because I'm
in the process of merging some of my trees into a more clean structure. 
I can't use bk because it won't let me merge 2.4.17 vanilla, and SGI's
CVS tree into one with tag/branches. CVS does (sort of) so I have to
keep CVS.
For my custom branch, I have bk setup, I can just import the changes
from XFS tree as a GNU diff and merge it in.
As for rmap, I'll just keep getting the diffs from his website, since I
don't want another kernel tree to deal with :-)
