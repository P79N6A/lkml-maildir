Could be a long standing problem with some powerpc platform drivers not
properly updated to Russel King changes from last year (still using
struct device_driver instead of struct platform_driver). A patch will be
sent to Linus shortly by Paulus which makes it work for us. More field
testing will be needed.
Ben.
