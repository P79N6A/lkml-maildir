hi,
  i am working on the project similar to Epckpt but with a concept of 
loadable module. here i have a problem in handling the page requests.
when i checkpoint a process in which malloc is used i found that if i 
malloc 1mb and make sure that all pages are used ( are present in
memory by making use of some loop in user program, i have written small
code is down ) before i checkpointed then there is no problem ,otherwise
its pmd_none is > 0 that's there is no valid pmd for it. i think i cannot
call handle_mm_fault ( or some thing like make_pages_present of mm.h,memory.c)
to bring the brk segment pages into memory because of invalid page tables!
In Epckpt he was in kernel and found it to be ok! but as i am working
as char driver i didn't get the same.
For this reason i am unable to get through it, can any one help me out.
please CC your message because i am not the list!
 
thanks for replying.

int main()
{
  int *p,i;
  p=(int *)malloc(SIZE*sizeof(int));
#if USE
 for(i=0 ; i< SIZE; i++)
   p[i]=i;
#endif
  :

  now checkpoint here
   fails if USE is not >= 1
