I recently swapped keyboards on the fly when my machine was "live". I
didn't want to reboot it for that uptime.  However, the keyboard didn't
reset itself to the required keyrate so I ended up having to bash the keys
for the required number of characters rather than just hold it down and
get auto-repeat. Is there an utility that tweaks the keyobard's attributes
for you? (I did reboot in the end - for 2.2.3 =)
Cheers,
Alex
