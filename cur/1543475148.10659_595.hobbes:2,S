    From my experience, I'd say yes;  I've a largish (26gb) NFS file
    server that's being run at a company I sysadmin at, and it has the
    annoying problem of generating hashes that are almost but not quite
    unique -- a (mv;mkdir;mv;ls) sequence will pretty regularly (once
    every two-three days, if the bug reports are to be believed) lead
    to either the moved file or created directory being invisible until
    the nfsd cache drains.
