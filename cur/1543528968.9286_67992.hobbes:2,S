Agreed...
While we are talking about 2.5, it would be nice if it was possible for
people to add drivers to the build without patching a single file.  This
would be very useful for people who distribute extra drivers with their
kernels, and want an easy way to drop them into the kernel build.
It is much easier for a vendor to do
	cp newdriver.{c,mk,config} linux/3rdparty
and have magic occur than it is to constantly maintain a patch which
does nothing but add make and config.in rules which pull the driver into
the vendor build.
