init_dev() is only called from tty_open() which is called under the BKL.

Ok, there should be some kind of lock of the tty_drivers list, I agree.
But that doesn't pertain to this module reference counting patch, right?

Woah!  Hm, this is going to cause lots of problems in drivers that have
been assuming that the BKL is grabbed during module unload, and during
open().  Hm, time to just fallback on the argument, "module unloading is
unsafe" :(

Yeah, you're right.  But this isn't the only subsystem that now has this
race :(
I still think the original patch will help, and it will remove all of
the MOD_INC usages in tty drivers, which is a step in the right
direction.
So I'll send this to Linus, and we'll move on to the next locking mess
in here...
thanks,
