(go back after reading previous discussion)
For that you need ioremap() to handle BATs and CAMs right?
What would be the difficulties with doing that?
For 8xx (which lacks BAT's and CAM's) we could try immediately I suppose.
Seems to be BenH's plan, along with making the virtual addresses
dynamic and not static. 
While at it, what are the possibilities of making BAT's and/or CAM's
available to userspace through hugetlbfs or some other mechanism?
