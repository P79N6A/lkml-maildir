I'm no expert on 'lxr', but as far as I can see version 0.3 is quite
old - according to 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/lxr
 - the latest
version is 0.9.4 - try upgrading to the latest version.

I think you'll have better luck with your query if you ask on one of
the lxr mailing lists, see 
http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=27350
for details. The linux-kernel mailing list is for discussing technical
details of the Linux kernel itself, not for asking questions about
various other tools.
