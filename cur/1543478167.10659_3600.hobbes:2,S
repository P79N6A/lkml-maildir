No. The kernel implements a 1GB/3GB phys.mem./virt.mem. split. Max. phys.
mem. supported is 960MB, this way.

No. But you can read linux/include/asm-i386/page.h from a 2.1/2.2 kernel and
do the changes to this file and linux/arch/i386/vmlinux.lds and recompile
your kernel to support more phys. mem. However, the virtual mem, a process
can use, will shrink. My kernel runs happily with 0x70000000 ...
