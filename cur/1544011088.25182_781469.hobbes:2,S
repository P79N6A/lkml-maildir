That's not to say it is a bad benchmark :) If it shows up a difference
and is a useful workload like kbuild, then it is a good benchmark.
Allocator changes tend to show up more when there is a lot of network
or disk IO happening. But it is good to see other tets too, so any
numbers you get are welcome.

For example, different allocation schemes will alter the chances of
getting different ways (colours), or false sharing. SLUB and SLQB
for example allow as fine as 8 byte allocation granularity wheras
SLAB goes down to 32 bytes, so small objects *could* be more prone
to false sharing. I don't know for sure at this stage, just guessing ;)
The difference doesn't show up significantly on my system, so profiling
doesn't reveal anything (I guess even on your system it would be
difficult to profile because it is not a huge difference).

Thanks! Code style and comments should be improved quite a bit now.
