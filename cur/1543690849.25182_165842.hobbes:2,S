Well, with at least Con Kolivas' patch set, turning swap
off seems to FREEZE (not panic) the kernel, hard.  This
is noticable on `shutdown -r now` in Gentoo, when the blinking
square that is my cursor suddenly turns solid white underneath
the line:
Deactivating swap partitions:          
I think something's broke, may be in CK's patch set (ck1 and 2
are affected) but I've not tested on the vanilla source. Test
both guys.
