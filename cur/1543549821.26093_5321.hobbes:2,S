you are right, i agree that synchronous OOM for higher-order allocations
must be preserved (just like ATOMIC allocations). But the overwhelming
majority of allocations is done at page granularity.
with multi-page allocations and the need for physically contiguous
buffers, the problem cannot be solved.
