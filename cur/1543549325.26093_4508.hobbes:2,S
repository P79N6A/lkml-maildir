Interesting idea... Have a Linux-style registry hive file mounted as a
reiserfs filesystem.
However, I'd prefer to be able to use Windows-style registry hive files if
possible.

I presume you mean SGI added it to IRIX? As for generally useful... possibly.
The sys_open() and sys_unlink() functions could be modified to make use of it
if it was stored on the inode. You could then use sys_CreateFileA() to
actually use it fully.
However, it won't work over NFS...
