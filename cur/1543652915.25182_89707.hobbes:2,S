Yes, this is great!  We can create a separate field in the bug reports to
contain this unique names, so we can reference the cset directly from
the bug reports.  This allows us to link bug reports to csets -- great!
What format will these unique names be in?  If we put them in the bug
reports,
can we click on them (as URLs) and get to the csets directly?
Thanks.
