This is a no-win strawman. Basically he says that he doesn't like Unix
or Unix-type operating systems, and that a version of Windows NT that does
not yet exist is the only thing that will work with an undefined thing he
calls "enterprise computing".
Note that the so-called Doctor is probably just a pen-name he uses in
the NT rag. He is a salesman for NT and most everybody knows NT needs
salesmen. It doesn't run on its own merits.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
