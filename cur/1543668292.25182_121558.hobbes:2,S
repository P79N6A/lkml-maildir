Helge Hafting already pointed out that writing out the data earlier isn't
desirable. The problem isn't in the waiting: the problem is in the writing.
I think the current kernel tries to write too much data too fast when
there's absolutely no reason to do so. It should probably gently write out
small amounts of data until there is a more pressing need for memory.
