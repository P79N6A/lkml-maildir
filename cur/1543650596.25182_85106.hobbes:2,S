The state of I/O can change only in two way. From I/O space available ( 1 )
to I/O space empty ( 0 ) and reverse. You generate 1->0 transactions and I
guess that ones are not very interesting. You're very much interested in
0->1 transaction indeed, that the kernel generates.

It has always been up for what it may concern. It's a T1 but during these
days it had quite a few hits because of epoll.
