Well, I've got the following:
486, SX-25 laptop, with 8 MB Ram, no swap, running 2.5.40 and also 2.4.19.
486, SX-20 laptop, with 4 MB Ram, 20 MB swap, running 2.2.21, and 2.2.13.
Both are capable of running the lastest Apache, with PHP support, and Lynx at a usable speed, (I use the 8 MB Ram machine for debugging small bits of PHP while I'm on the tube going up to London :-) ).
I know "feels springier" isn't very helpful, but what benchmarks do you expect me to run on machines with 120 Meg HDs?  :-)  Suggest something, and I'll give it a go.  It's not really faster, just more responsive, (E.G. doing a updatedb, and using jed at the same time is better in 2.5.x).
By the way, I've got X11 running on the 4 meg one, and it's quite usable.  I have even demoed a graphical browser accessing the local Apache, serving PHP content.
If anybody doesn't believe me, come along to Linux Expo UK next week, and see for yourselves :-).
John.
