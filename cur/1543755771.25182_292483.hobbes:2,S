can't work. pthread interprocess spinlocks are hopelessly non-RT safe
in 2.4/linuxthreads. or they were the last time i looked - they rely
on sending signals and passing through the whole pthread layer.
this is why we use FIFO's right now: fast, portable (though not to OSX
<grin> - we have to use Mach ports to get enough speed there), and a
PITA :)

i mentioned earlier today in a message to bill huey that JACK is
really a user-space cooperative scheduler. JACK's "scheduler" knows
who is doing what and when, and if it doesn't then it can't work at
all. so the scenario you describe is impossible and/or broken.
please keep in mind this description of JACK. there is no doubt some
remnant of the work i did on scheduler activations in the mid-90's
left floating around in my head and shaping JACK in mysterious ways :)
