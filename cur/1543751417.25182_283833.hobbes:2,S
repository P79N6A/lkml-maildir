The set of people who have contributed hugetlb patches, plus akpm.

Not all points apply to all patches, of course. I've seen the
separation of functions problems more in Christoph's patches than
portability issues, not to say they are nonexistant. The most prominent
case of a portability issue was in Kenneth Chen's patches.

That bit was largely directed at akpm, regarding an off-list discussion.

The backward compatibility concerns apply to a past patch, the
expand-on-mmap() code, and the COW patches. Zero-fill-on-demand patches
haven't posed particular problems there.

My hurt feelings about my own code won't have an impact on this.
What has been holding up the show has been a serious bug there has not
been a resolution on yet. I'm probably going to give up on that bug
being fixed before other things are done and just do the heavy review
and testing, particularly as I'm in a unique position to have access to
all of the arches supporting hugetlb.
