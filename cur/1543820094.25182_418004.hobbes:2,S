Turned out this was exactly what the problem was. Wine attempts to match 
Windows as far as read/write/execute mappings go, and war3.exe tried to 
execute memory in a section with "MEM_EXECUTE" not set.
I'm surprised the program works on Windows with DEP/NX enabled, but apparently 
it does. There's a patch floating around on the Wine mailing list which adds 
a workaround for this problem:

Many thanks to Marcus Meissner for debugging it.
