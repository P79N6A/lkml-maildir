You don't need to - just post "2.5.x ide is working, and not dangerous to your data", and loads of people will start using it.  That way, we get it tested a decent amount.
Of course when somebody's root fs get fsck'ed, (pun intended), the list is bound to get a flamewar^Whelpfully worded bug report.
The false rumors that IDE was fubar for a long time in 2.5.x, coupled with the fact that a lot of recent 2.5.x kernels don't compile, seem to have scared off people which is rediculous.
