Yes, but notice that:
a) 4K blocksize is maximum you can get on i386
b) 4K blocksize means wasted space when you have small files
c) my patch makes sense even _with_ 4k blocksize
...so you actually want 4K blocksize PLUS my patch.

PS: Yes, my testing is done on 3G filesystem with 1K blocksize because
that's all what I've available. But some person already tried it with
4K blocksize and yes it made difference.
