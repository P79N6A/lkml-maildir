    The attached patch is needed to make tdfxfb compile after
applying this patch and also in test8-mm1 (so presumably in your older
patch as well) (tdfxfb_imageblt calls cfb_imageblt).
    tdfx is still badly broken in -mm1 both before and after replacing
the older fbdev patch in -mm1 with your new one.  The behavior is much
the same as reported with other drivers -- out of range frequencies
and the same backtraces.  With fbset working I can set a new
resolution which gets me a barely usable console -- lots of
artifacts.
    I don't have time to test against vanilla -test8; maybe later.
Thanks!
