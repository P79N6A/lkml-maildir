That naming convention (e.g. l-lan@3000000c) is what is defined in the 
IEEE Standard for Boot (Initialization Configuration) Firmware spec, and 
what gets presented by Open Firmware.  It is what has been used in things 
like /proc/device-tree on the Power platforms forever, and thus was 
carried over into the sysfs definitions.
It is also true that it is unlike the representation of most other things 
in sysfs, so perhaps this is the time to change before it gets too baked 
into things.
