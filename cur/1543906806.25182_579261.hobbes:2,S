I agree, we really should do something about atime.
But the fsync thing is a real issue. It literally makes ext3 almost 
unusable from a latency standpoint on many loads. I have a fast disk, and 
don't actually tend to have all that much going on normally, and it still 
hurts occasionally. 
One of the most common (and *best*) reasons for using fsync is for the 
mail spool. So anybody that uses local email will actually be doing a lot 
of fsync, and while you could try to thread the interfaces, I don't think 
a lot of mailers do.
So fsync ends up being a latency issue for something that a lot of people 
actually see, and something that you actually end up working with and you 
notice the latencies very clearly. Your editor auto-save feature is 
another good example of that exact same thing: the fsync actually is there 
for a very good reason, even if you apparently decided that you'd rather 
disable it.
But yeah, "noatime,data=writeback" will quite likely be *quite* noticeable 
(with different effects for different loads), but almost nobody actually 
runs that way.
I ended up using O_NOATIME for the individual object "open()" calls inside 
git, and it was an absolutely huge time-saver for the case of not having 
"noatime" in the mount options. Certainly more than your estimated 10% 
under some loads.
The "relatime" thing that David mentioned might well be very useful, but 
it's probably even less used than "noatime" is. And sadly, I don't really 
see that changing (unless we were to actually change the defaults inside 
the kernel).
