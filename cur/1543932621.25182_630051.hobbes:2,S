Why define these if they are only used in one place?
Also, as you use dev_info(), I think you are duplicating some of the
information in the resulting printk(), right?

Post a report where?  Who is going to handle these reports?
The last time someone put a line like this in the kernel, I got a ton of
email and didn't know what to do with it.  If you really are trusting of
this patch, please put your email address in this printk(), so that you
can properly handle the resulting reports.  I sure don't want to :)

What's with the extra () around the function?

Spelling check for your comments :)
