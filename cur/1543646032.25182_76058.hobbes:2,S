The sequence-number of an IP Packet, whether or not it's fragmented,
has nothing to do with any order of reception. The "2nd" part of
a fragmented packet may be received at any time, in fact multiple
times. Any so-called Network appliance that assumes that there is
any specific order of packets being received is fundamentally
broken.
Well designed network software can sometimes optimize its buffer
handling if it "knows" that the last packet of a fragment has
been received, but it can't count on any specific order because
there isn't any. Even if you put all your "ducks in a row" on
the wire, once the least-cost route becomes different for different
packets, all bets are off. You might get one packet with satellite-
link latency (seconds) and another with terrestrial latency
(miliseconds).
