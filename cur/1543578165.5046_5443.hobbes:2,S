Absolutely. This is why I have no conceptual problems with the networking
layer changes, and why I am in violent disagreement with people who think
the networking layer should have used the (much inferior, in my opinion)
kiobuf/kiovec approach.
For people who worry about code re-use and argue for kiobuf/kiovec on
those grounds, I can only say that the code re-use should go the other
way. It should be "the bad code should re-use code from the good code". It
should NOT be "the new code should re-use code from the old code".
