Steve,
 no question that those are seriour users that give you serious
feedback. And if you call that
exposure, I am not going to argue. It is your project, it is your
marketing. (And *I* am not going to argue about SGI marketing :-(
 From a mainline point of view XFS on Linux will only be successfull if
it is "in the kernel". Fully maintained and "Linus approved". I am not
sure when SGI started the port (could even go back to the time when I
worked for them, late 1997). Definitely quite some time. By now it
should be in the kernel. Maybe marked "experimental". As I see it now
EXT3, ReiserFS and maybe JFS are just eating the XFS lunch away.
 In any case, the Vanderbilt comment is right on.
Martin
