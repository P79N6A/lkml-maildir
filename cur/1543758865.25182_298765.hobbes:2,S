Hi.
My first response is: this is a recipe for great confusion among users.
I'd far rather see things only make it into your tree when they've been
thoroughly tested (in -mm and prior to that). Following that strategy,
your tree could always be relied upon to be stable and -rcs would only
needed for dealing with the unforeseen interactions between otherwise
mature patches.
Regards,
Nigel
