You're right, it's not necessary.
It just reports as 'Unknown' but works same as with the patch.
After some more testing, it plays fine, mixer works mostly, minus the
issue with recording.  Attempting to record seems to inject 60 cycle hum
into the system and recorded output either bombs out or is just the hum -
no line-in signal is recorded.  Looks like the realtek alc101 has some
quirks...
