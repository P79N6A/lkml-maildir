To an extent yes. But from my experience with application developing I
also know of bugs I would have never discovered because I wouldn't
have *dreamed* of ever using the software *that* way. Yes, the
designer most probably knows where problems are likely. But few
designers also take into account misuse (or rather unexpected use) of
facilities.
And it's *here* where independent testers could mean a plus.
Hmm, this reminds of a magazine article quite some time ago on quality
assurance, where somebody reported that they got quite a drop in
errors found in qa after 'accidently' putting a test machine where
their programmers could use it unnoticed ;-)
