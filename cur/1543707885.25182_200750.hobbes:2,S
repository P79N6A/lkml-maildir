Subject: Client looses NFS handle (kernel 2.6.3)

The client looses the handle to a statically mounted NFS file system. A 
user sees
a stale handle in "df" and can't access files and directories.
When root issues a "df" or accesses a file or directory on the NFS file 
system,
it gets a correct result.
Thereafter a normal user also can access files and directories on the 
NFS file system.
After a short time the NFS handle becomes stale again.
/var/log/messages contains the lines:
Feb 21 23:33:50 gsr108 kernel: RPC: Can't bind to reserved port (13).
Feb 21 23:33:50 gsr108 kernel: RPC: can't bind to reserved port.
after a user tries to access a file on the NFS file system.
The NFS server runs kernel version 2.4.23 SMP. Client NFS 2.4.23 works.
The filesystem is mounted with the following options in /etc/fstab:
rw,bg,hard,intr,rsize=8192,wsize=8192
We are stuck and can't upgrade to 2.6.x with this bug.
