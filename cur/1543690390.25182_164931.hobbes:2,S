If current trends continue, a L2 cache miss will be
taking 5000 cycles in 15 to 20 years.

While I have seen some evidence of computer scientists
going home and ignoring the problems presented to them
by current hardware constraints, I'd really prefer it
if they took up the challenge and did the research on
how we should deal with hardware in the future.
In fact, I've made up a little (incomplete) list of
things that I suspect are in need of serious CS research,
because otherwise both OS theory and practice will be
unable to deal with the hardware of the next decade.
