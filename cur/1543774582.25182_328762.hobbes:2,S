Just out of curiosity, could you please specify few exact examples with 
specific file/function names which duplicate the existing 
infrastructure. What do they duplicate and why? How should these 
functions be implemented on VFS? Ho should the the other FSes 
implement/ignore them? Why are you shure they will fit VFS well? etc.
Thanks.
