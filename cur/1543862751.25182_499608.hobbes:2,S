Nope.  You've completely omitted the little fact that we'll do writeback in
the offending zone off the LRU.  Slower, maybe.  But it should work and the
system should recover.  If it's not doing that (it isn't) then we should
fix it rather than avoiding it (by punting writeback over to pdflush).
Once that's fixed, if we determine that there are remaining and significant
performance issues then we can take a look at that.

Yes it does.  It asks pdflush to perform writeback of the offending zone(s)
rather than (or as well as) doing it directly.  The only reason pdflush can
sucessfuly do that is because pdflush can allocate its requests from other
zones.

That shouldn't be possible, in theory.  Block IO is supposed to succeed if
*all memory in the machine is dirty*: the old
dirty-everything-with-MAP_SHARED-then-exit problem.  Lots of testing went
into that and it works.  It also failed on NFS although I thought that got
"fixed" a year or so ago.  Apparently not.

Well one example would be a GFP_KERNEL allocation on a highmem machine in
whcih all of ZONE_NORMAL is dirty.

Not if all the eligible zones are all-dirty.

The need for that has yet to be demonstrated.  There _might_ be a problem,
but we need test cases and analyses to demonstrate that need.
Right now, what we have is an NFS bug.  How about we fix it, then
reevaluate the situation?
A good starting point would be to show us one of these oom-killer traces.

That was what I was referring to.
