It's kind of hard to run anything over SSH if it has to be run before 
userspace is up.  But the kernel can collect results from a modified 
memtest, after it chains back.

What are you saying?  Linux is going to fix faulty RAM?  The point with 
testing RAM is you *want* to see it fail; you don't want Linux to fix it.

These are not RAM faults.  The very last thing you want is evidence that 
you've got a faulty piece of RAM when the fault is actually a hard disk 
glitch!
