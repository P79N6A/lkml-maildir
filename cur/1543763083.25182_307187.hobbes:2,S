The new assembler won't accept
	movl %gs,128(%rsp)
It makes it harder to generate binary code user doesn't tend. FWIW,
what I suggested are in
http://sourceware.org/ml/binutils/2005-03/msg00873.html
Thera are things like
-		asm volatile("movl %%fs,%0" : "=g" (fsindex)); 
+		asm volatile("movl %%fs,%0" : "=r" (fsindex));

There is no such an instruction of "movl %ds,(%eax)". The old assembler
accepts it and turns it into "movw %ds,(%eax)". It won't catch problems
like
	unsigned fsindex;
	asm volatile("movl %%fs,%0" : "=m" (fsindex)); 
The "movw %ds,(%eax)" bug was fixed in binutils 2.15.94.0.1. Gas no
longer generates 0x66 for it. If you find gas preventing you from doing
what the hardware supports, I will be happy to fix it.
