There are two points regarding this:
(i) You need to track heads of remote branches anyway.
(ii) I want an easy way for user to refer to head of another working
tree on the same repository (so that you can do just git merge testing).
This is why the multiple heads are there, and it's actually everything
they _do_. There's nothing more behind it.
