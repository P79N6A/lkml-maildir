A filesystem could get there, but I doubt it'd want to be releasing
buffers.  But now I see truncation's invalidate_complete_page,
that looks quite capable of racing with the kswapd instance.
Anyway, I don't disagree with your patch, and happy to see it now
in Linus' tree: was just wanting to make clear that I hadn't actually
seen the race in question, and didn't know if you were fixing a
potentiality or something actually seen.
