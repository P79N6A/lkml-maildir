Try disabling PAE mode -- it only slows down your 1GB system anyway and
who knows -- maybe that is what broke.

re: acpi=force
ACPI and MPS both recognize your 2nd processor as LAPIC ID 1, and the
smpboot code that tries to start it up and fails is common to both modes
-- so I don't see an MPS or ACPI-specific issue here.

I don't see these options having any effect on the root problem, which
is that the kernel faults when starting the 2nd processor.  Note that
"noapic" technically isn't supported on an MPS compliant SMP system.
