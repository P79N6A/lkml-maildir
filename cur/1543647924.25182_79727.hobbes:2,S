Hello, 
This is a failure to connect! The socket is therefore not ready for
writing  or reading -ever. This behavior may not be correct, not
because of a failure to set the POLLOUT bit, but because the POLLIN
bit is set. Check if this is really true. I can't duplicate this
on 2.4.18 here because it's hard to get a deferred connect with my
setup.
It's really true:..
Here is some strace output:
Case where connect() succeeds:
connect(3, {sin_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(111), 
sin_addr=inet_addr("127.0.0.1")}}, 16) = -1 EINPROGRESS (Operation now in 
progress)
poll([{fd=3, events=POLLIN|POLLOUT, revents=POLLOUT}], 1, -1) = 1
getsockopt(3, SOL_SOCKET, SO_ERROR, [0], [4]) = 0
As you can see SO_ERROR returns '0', connection succeeded.
Case where connect() fails:
connect(3, {sin_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(110), 
sin_addr=inet_addr("127.0.0.1")}}, 16) = -1 EINPROGRESS (Operation now in 
progress)
poll([{fd=3, events=POLLIN|POLLOUT, revents=POLLIN|POLLERR|POLLHUP}], 1, -1) 
= 1
getsockopt(3, SOL_SOCKET, SO_ERROR, [111], [4]) = 0
As you can see SO_ERROR returns '111', connection failed.
