Thank you very much.
My patch is the first step.
 I think there are these TODOs around IPv6 IPsec as far as I remember.
- Extension Header Processing on inbound:
  As a result of IPv6 IPsec support, Extension Header processing is devided
  into ipv6_parse_exthdrs and ipproto->handler. I think it is better to merge
  other Extension Header handling into ipproto->handler.
- Fragmentation support on outbound:
  We should change ipv6_build_xmit like ip_append_data style to support
  fragmentation with IPsec.
- Removing duplicate codes, clean up and improveing performance.
- Considering relation of IPv6 IPsec and Mobile IPv6. This is future stuff.
