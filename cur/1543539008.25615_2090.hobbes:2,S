James Simmons, iirc.  It does however look correct.  Maybe the problem
is lower down in the card-specific drivers rather than here?  Before
backing out the change, I think we need more investigation of the cause
of the problem.
(I think this may be a case where the change fixes some problems on some
drivers, but seems to break others).
