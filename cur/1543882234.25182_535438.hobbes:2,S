From: Jens Axboe <jens.axboe@oracle.com>
There's a really rare and obscure bug in CFQ, that causes a crash in
cfq_dispatch_insert() due to rq == NULL. One example of that is seen
here:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/15/41
Neil correctly diagnosed the situation for how this can happen, read
that analysis here:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/25/57
This looks like it requires md to trigger, even though it should
potentially be possible to due with O_DIRECT (at least if you edit the
kernel and doctor some of the unplug calls).
The fix is to move the ->next_rq update to when we add a request to the
rbtree. Then we remove the possibility for a request to exist in the
rbtree code, but not have ->next_rq correctly updated.
