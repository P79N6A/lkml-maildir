This would have to be in addition to the existing cpuset_sem wont it ??
Not sure if we need to add any more complexity unless the scaling problem
is really huge.
However if we do end up making any changes then IMO locking can be made 
more granular, instead of one sem for cpus, memory and all operations 
on cpusets
