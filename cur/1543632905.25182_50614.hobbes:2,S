I'm not too sure this level of abstraction is needed by userspace.
It would be enough if the appropriate things were all controlable
in /proc/sys/ etc. and then you just have:
/etc/sysctl.{laptop,server,desktop}.conf
It would be better to have it explicit in userspace as you're
always going to need to tweak things IMHO.
