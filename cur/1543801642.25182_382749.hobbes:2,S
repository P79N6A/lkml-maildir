I suppose that depends on your expectations from defconfig.  In my
mind its the one that builds into a kernel that will boot and run
on just about any box.  People who want to get a bit of extra performance
will do the re-compilation to strip out the bits that they don't want
and tune down limits that are set higher than they need.  I only
ever boot a defconfig kernel to check that it still works, my systems
all run tiger_defconfig/zx1_defconfig based most of the time.  But
perhaps I'm the weird one?
There are quite a few >16 socket boxes out there, which will give

system is going to remain in the noise for long.
