A favor that I'd ask of the Linux kernel gurus is:
As 2.6 starts stabilizing, PLEASE try to synch up major components of
2.6 and 2.4 so that the same user space can be used for either version.
It's fine with modutils and stuff, but when it comes to LVM, these 2.4
and 2.6 versions are a problem. 2.4 doesn't have Device Mapper in
baseline, and getting DM and XFS in is sorta hard. (ACPI seems to be in
better shape now.)
To enlarge the testing base, it would be good if people could just drop
a 2.6 kernel, some user-space updates and then dual-boot 2.4 and 2.6
hassle free at will without worrying about a dozen 2.4 kernel patches to
make it compatible with the new user space.
(I may have missed a 2.4 spinoff that does just that, merge DM and XFS
and ACPI and other updates so it can coexist with a 2.6-user space.)
