I've changed my mind since. There isn't anything critical here and
pushing random patches to Linus right before he releases 2.6.11 wouldn't
have been particularly subtle. So I instead sent a patch to Greg, as can
be seen here:
http://archives.andrew.net.au/lm-sensors/msg29405.html
So Mark, providing Greg accepts this patch, you can assume that
I2C_ALGO_MV64XXX is already properly defined in Greg's tree (where your
own patch will end up) so you don't need to add it yourself. You will
still have to define I2C_HW_MV64XXX though.
Thanks,
