I've captured more data in the instrumentation and found
the rpc_task's timer is being requeued by an application
task which is preempting ksoftirqd when it wakes up in
xprt_transmit().  This is what I had originally suspected
but likely didn't communicate it effectively.
The scenario unfolds as:
                                          [high priority app task]
                                              :
                                          call_transmit()
                                             xprt_transmit()
                                             /* blocks in xprt_transmit() */
ksoftirqd()
     __run_timers()
         list_del("rpc_task_X.timer") /* logically off cascade */
         rpc_run_timer(data)
             task->tk_timeout_fn(task)
             /* ksoftirqd preempted */
                                              :
                                              ---------------------------------------------------------
                                              /* Don't race with disconnect */
                                              if (!xprt_connected(xprt))
                                                  task->tk_status = -ENOTCONN;
                                              else if (!req->rq_received)
                                                  rpc_sleep_on(&xprt->pending, task, NULL, xprt_timer);
                                              ---------------------------------------------------------
                                                      __rpc_sleep_on()
                                                          __mod_timer("rpc_task_X.timer")  /* requeued in cascade */
                                              /* blocks */
         /* rpc_run_timer resumes from preempt */
         clear_bit(RPC_TASK_HAS_TIMER, "rpc_task_X.tk_runstate");
         /* rpc_task_X.timer is now enqueued in cascade without
            RPC_TASK_HAS_TIMER set and will not be dequeued
            in rpc_release_task()/rpc_delete_timer() */
The usage of "rpc_task_X.timer" indicates the same KVA
observed for the timer struct at the associated points
in the instrumented code.
The above was gathered by logging usage of the
kernel/timer.c primitives.  Thus I don't have more
detailed state of the rpc_task in RPC context.
However I did verify which of the three calls to
rpc_sleep_on() in xprt_transmit() was being invoked
(as above).
So the root cause appears to be the rpc_task's timer
being requeued in xprt_transmit() when rpc_run_timer
is preempted.  From looking at the code I'm unsure
if modifying xprt_transmit()/out_receive is appropriate
to synchronize with rpc_release_task().  It seems
allowing rpc_sleep_on() to occur is more natural and
for rpc_release_task() to detect the pending timer and
remove it before proceeding.  I'm still in the process
of trying to digest the logic here but I thought there
was enough information here to be of use.  Suggestions,
warnings welcome.
