Need to test it a bit first (i.e. at least compile it)...

Actually, there are 2 ways to go about this: LILO could do the UUID/LABEL
resolution at the time lilo is run (to store root dev into kernel), and
_also_ append "root=LABEL=X" to kernel options, so that if the kernel
can't resolve the UUID/LABEL (i.e. no support for this option) we can fall
back to the root dev from when LILO was run.

LVM now has UUID-like identifiers for all "partitions" (Logical Volumes),
although they are not really accessible by any tools right now. The "LABEL"
is actually the LV name, so it is used directly all the time:
/dev/vgroot/lvroot	/	ext3	defaults	1	1
/dev/vgroot/lvswap	none	swap	sw,pri=100	0	0
This obviates most of the reason for the UUID/LABEL support, but not
everyone runs LVM (yet ;-) and ext2 UUID/LABELs are still useful.
Cheers, Andreas
