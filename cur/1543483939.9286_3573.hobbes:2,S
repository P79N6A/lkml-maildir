Fast VM I would say. You tend to load a simulation and churn over it.
Now, I have missed the first few items in the thread - I read it to say
you can't get more than 2G of VM at present. If we're talking about

ObProductionLine: A Web document I found said that up to 1995 (i.e
seventeen years into his term of office) John-Paul II had created 274
saints, which is to say about sixteen a year, or one every twenty-two
days. Does the man never rest?
