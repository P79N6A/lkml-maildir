vanilla kernels = 2.6.0-test11 through 2.6.3-rc2 and no patches.  APIC is on.
12-5-2003 BIOS:

not lock up:
I could reproduce the lockup consistantly.  With the 12-5-2003 bios, I cannot.  Two months have passed since the original report.

The different nforce boards react differently because of different hardware an

I don't know how to identify a fix from my bioses.  If someone has any clue, I
