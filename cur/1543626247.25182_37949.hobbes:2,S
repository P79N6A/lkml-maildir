Ok, after a few hours of a very pleasant resyncing work and re-testing
(it was great to see lots of good stuff integrated from Marcelo) it's
out right now.  If you could retest the NUMA-Q support on top of
2.4.19pre5aa1 that would be helpful to know if the presistent kmap is a
problem in mremap (the place where it's currently buggy in 2.5). Thanks!
Andrea
