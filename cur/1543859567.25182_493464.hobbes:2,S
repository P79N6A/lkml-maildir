Make that "strongly suspecting" given what Greg said ... he normally
gets the final say over drivers/core/* things, and you seem alone in
wanting to help those sysfs files extend their withered existence.

It does say that indents must use only tabs, which that clearly doesn't.
I think you'll find that
	if (some_very_long_condition
			&& probably_not_quite_as_long
			&& or_too_long_for_one_line) {
		do_this;
		and_this;
	}
is widely accepted.  (The conditions get an extra indent so they don't
look like they're part of the block executing if the test is true.)

Tough noogies, as they say.  In a tradeoff between correctness and your
personal taste (or even mine, sigh!), the normal tradeoff is in favor
of correctness.

But you _didn't_ do anything to "make it necessary".  Which means that
your patch *WILL* cause bugs whenever a driver uses those calls, and
courtesy of your patch userspace tries to suspend that device ...

Userland can stop using this **TODAY** and just "ifdown", so that
argument seems weak.  For all your examples, the userland interface
is already available.
