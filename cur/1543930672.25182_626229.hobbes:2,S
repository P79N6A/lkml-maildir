The same mail that contained this part, copied verbatim:
"Let me close with perhaps the most relevant remarks: the attached code
 has been in heavy testing and in production for months now.  Thus there
 is nothing theoretical when I say it works, and the patch speaks for
 itself in terms of obvious correctness."
We must have differing opinions on what obvious correctness is.
Future replies to /dev/null, please.
