Before going to hard to maintain DMI black lists we should first check 
if it's a more general problem and can't it be solved better? Most likely
that system isn't the one with this issue and I don't want to apply
DMI patches forever.
In particular: what lspci chipset does it have?  If it's Intel it might be
worth checking the datasheet if there is some "HPET stop" bit -- perhaps it 
could be fixed up.
We seem to have a couple of Intel systems recently with HPET trouble.
