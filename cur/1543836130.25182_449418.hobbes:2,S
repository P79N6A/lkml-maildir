thanks for the explanation. But still something I'm missing, how can a
MAX_ORDER block be allocated in a memory whose size is only 128Ko ?
Can't it be detected by the buddy allocatorvery early without doing any 
relative arithmetic on a page* ?

ah ok but that means that pfn_valid() will still returns ok for invalid page which
are in a invalid memory marked as reserved. Is it not risky ?

sorry but I don't understand. I would say that sparsemem section size should
be chosen to make mem_map[] and mem_section[] sizes as small as possible.

well there're big holes in address space.
