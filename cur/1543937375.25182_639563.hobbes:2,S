I'm worried to some extent about how ungeneric this is. A thermal zone 
may cover any devices, not just processor and video ones. Perhaps this 
should be added to the acpi_device struct instead, and then let 
individual drivers implement whatever callbacks are appropriate?

This all seems like duplication of the backlight interface?
(Speaking of which - Len, what's happening with my patches to the video 
driver? Some feedback would be nice)
