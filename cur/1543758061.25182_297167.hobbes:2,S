The current scheduler has a 1-100 priority range for soft realtime 
tasks.  To insert a task into a realtime class, you need to have root 
privileges.
As long as you make sure that kernel threads get set to higher 
priorities than your user threads, then you get the above behaviour. 
Ultimately, however, the administrator is responsable for ensuring that 
everything is running with sane priority levels.
