It avoids useless warnings. If you have a pointer and want to store if
it is NULL/non-NULL in an integer variables, you have to use !x or !!x.
Just using x will result in a warning that you convert a pointer to an
integer without a cast.
Given this example:
int main()
{
	int ret;
	void *foo;
	ret = foo;
	ret = !!foo;
	return 0;
}
gcc will emit this warning:
ttt.c:6: warning: assignment makes integer from pointer without a cast
