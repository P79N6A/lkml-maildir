OK, let's look at the logic here:
1) In order for this tool to work, it must parse the kernel config files,
and come up with a data structure that relates "options" to the physical
files on the filesystem.
2) This is a similar (if not identical) process that "make fooconfig" must
do in order to build the kernel in the first place
3) The current config system is concidered "brittle and buggy"
4) The work involved with writing a general purpose kernel config parser
(which may enable more than just this particular tool) is considered
excessive.
Well, all this suggests to me that the real problem lurking at the root of
this discussion is the current config system. Fix it, and the problem goes
away.
Where is it documented? Who designed it? Is an overhaul planned?
