May I ask you to elaborate on this? Less per MHz doesn't matter much
if the frequency is much higher, or it does? I mean, if you put, say,
a 133 MHz pentium and a 1 GB pentium to do the same thing with the
same SW (mail server, for example), the 1GB system may use less per
MHz (newer silicon, lower voltage, etc...) and its flip-flops toggle
for a smaller percentage of time, but its electricity bill will still
be the higher one, or not?
In general: has anybody ever done *this* kind of benchmarks? Comparing
electricity consumption among different systems doing just the same
task?
