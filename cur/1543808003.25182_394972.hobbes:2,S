Well, that's probably because I always do my best to be nice and follow the
rules that Pavel sets.  I post patches to modify the existing code and not to
replace it top-down.  I keep them as compact as reasonably possible
and focus on one thing at a time.  I remove the parts that Pavel and other
people don't like or I try to modify these parts to be more acceptable.
Etc.  This is not _that_ difficult.

Well, this is your opinion.
In my opinion a maintainer need not be a developer.  The dictionary definition
of "to maintain" is "to keep a road, machine, building, etc. in good condition"
(

)
which need not impy any development.

Rafael
