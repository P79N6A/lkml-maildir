Hrm... I'm still not sure how I'm supposed to implement those
for non-consistent PPCs (embedded). We don't carry state information
around, so I suppose I'll have to rely on the direction beeing the
same for the whole duration of the operation... In which case, it's
just a matter of having for_cpu nop'ing when direction is TO_DEVICE
and for_device nop'ing when direction is FROM_DEVICE ? Not clear
imho...
Ben.
