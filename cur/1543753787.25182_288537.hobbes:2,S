This is correct, guaranteeing more memory to be freeable in lowmem (ptes
aren't freeable without a sigkill for example) the icache/dcache will at
least have a margin where it can grow indipendently from highmem
allocations.

I don't know myself if it makes a performance difference, all old
benchmarks have been run with this applied. This was applied for
correcntess (i.e.  to avoid sigkills or lockups), it wasn't applied for
performance. But I don't see how it could hurt performance (especially
given current code already does the check at runtime, which is
pratically the only fast-path cost ;).

Woops, forgotten about it ;)

Thanks. If you prefer I can write it too to relieve you from this load,
it's up to you. If you want to fix it yourself go ahead of course ;)
