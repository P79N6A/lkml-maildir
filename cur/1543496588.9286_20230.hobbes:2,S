Alex,
   It was very bad.  *laugh*  I saw it, it was... disgusting.  They
apparently were allowing anyone to post anything, and it was a bunch of
like, 13 year old pucks who wanted to say 'pussy', and 'fuck' because
thier parents said it was bad.  
  The page did say that it would be updated, and well... it is =).
js  [btw: I have nothing to do with linuxhq.org, I just saw someone post
to the list, and thought that I woul check it out.]
