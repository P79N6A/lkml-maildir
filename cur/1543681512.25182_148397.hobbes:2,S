| Hello,
| 
|      I have noticed a problem when compiling kernel modules outside of the
| kernel tree for 2.5(.75).  I am compiling a 3rd party network module for
| 2.5 and it needs to include "linux/netdevice.h" .  This file includes a
| bunch of other kernel headers which in turn include more kernel headers.
| This eventually gets to "asm/irq.h" and on my architechture (i386) this
| file has the line
| 
|    #include "irq_vectors.h"
| 
|      The problem is that this "irq_vectors.h" file is not found in the same
| directory as "irq.h" but in a different directory that is explicitly added
| to the include path for the kernel in "arch/i386/Makefile" .   This is just
| fine for kernel compiles using the kernel makefiles, but for stuff outside
| of the tree it means that "irq_vectors.h" won't be found.  A solution would
| be to to duplicate the relevant sections of the kernel's architecture
| specific makefile stuff to calculate and add the include path myself, but
| this seems unclean and would require me to add more architecture specific
| voodoo for each architecture to be supported.
| 
|      I believe the proper solution would be for the kernel build system to
| create a symbolic link to "irq_vectors.h" in "asm-i386/" just as "asm/"
| itself is a symbolic link to "asm-i386/" instead of adding an include path
| in the architecture specific makefile that breaks out-of-tree compiles.
Are you using the expected style of Makefile?
See linux/Documentation/modules.txt and
linux/Documentation/kbuild/makefiles.txt .
For a outside-the-kernel-tree module that I just built, I don't
have this problem.  I modified this external module to printk()
the value of NR_IRQS (from irq_vectors.h) with no problems.
Here is my Makefile:
# makefile for oops_test/dump*.c
# Randy Dunlap, 2003-03-12
# usage:
# cd /path/to/kernel/source && make SUBDIRS=/path/to/source/oops_test/ modules
CONFIG_OOPS_TEST=m
obj-m := dump_test.o
# dump_test-objs := dump_test.o
clean-files := *.o
# fini;
