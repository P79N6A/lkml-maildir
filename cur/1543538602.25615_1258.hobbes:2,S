Yes, the reverse translation is the obvious thing to think about,
but the way I describe has no performance problems.
A quite common setup is to have a partitioned disk, with all filesystem
accesses going to a partition, so that it doesnt matter if whole-disk
access is slightly more expensive: only lilo, fdisk and the like access
the whole disk. Perhaps dd, or some backup program.
So: no cost to the common case.
A much rarer setup, also used, is to have a big database on an
unpartitioned disk. Now all accesses are to the whole disk, but the list
of partitions is empty, so walking it does not take very long.

You mean: which is not part of the current kernel.
No, I only submit code that is actually used somewhere.
I have more stuff that seems obviously necessary, but as
long as nobody uses it there is no need to put it into the kernel.

It serves to give a list of partition names.
If you mount something by label or uuid, then the mount program
has to access a number of devices, examine the label there, and
when the label is found mount the device.
So, /proc/partitions provides this list of devices.
[That was the original motivation. In the meantime, there are many
uses. E.g., I often see distribution installation programs use it.]
If a program needs the partition starting point, it can use the
HDIO_GETGEO ioctl which returns a
   struct hd_geometry {
      unsigned char heads;
      unsigned char sectors;
      unsigned short cylinders;
      unsigned long start;
   };
If one needs the partition starting point from the command line,
there are various utilities (e.g., hdparm -g) that will print it.

No. And that is an operation very often used, mostly inside
the kernel, and also the kernel has no mechanism.
One sees MKDEV(MAJOR(dev), MINOR(dev)&mask) or similar stuff
everywhere. In my big "large device number" rewrite, the minorstruct
of a subdevice has a pointer to the minorstruct of the whole device.
(Basically because MKDEV() becomes an expensive operation involving
a search and possibly a memory allocation.)
