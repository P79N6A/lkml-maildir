I know that. But vread() is also suitable for /proc/kcore so I was
considering to use it there in the future (but that is not time-critical
either). Also, while we are at it, we need vwrite() because at the moment
write_kmem() just returns 0 if pos>=high_memory.

The user address passed to vread() belongs to process' address space.
What is the worst thing that can happen to it - another thread sharing
the same address space can cause it to be unmapped.  Is there no way to
prevent it from happening? Why can't I say something like
kmap_user_range(uaddr, len) (which would EFAULT if this combination is
invalid)? file_read_actor() can kmap() a page so there should be a way to
kmap() more than 1 page?

Tigran.
