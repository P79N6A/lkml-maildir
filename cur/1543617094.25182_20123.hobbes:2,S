Two technical obstacles:
	a) on some architecures modular code is slower (IIRC, the problem is
with medium-range calls being faster than far ones and usable only in the
kernel proper).  We probaly want to leave a gap after the .text and remap
.text of module in there - if I understand the problem that should be
enough, but that's really a question to folks dealing with these ports (PPC64
and Itanic?)
	b) current differences between options parsing in case of built-in
and modular drivers.
The rest is trivial and should be done in 2.5.4-pre* or so.
But it still leaves you with tristate - instead of yes/module/no it's
yes/yes, but don't put it on initramfs/no.  However, dependencies become
simpler - all you need is "I want this, that and that on initramfs" and
the rest can be found by depmod (i.e. configurator doesn't have to deal
with "FOO goes on initramfs (== old Y), so BAR and BAZ must go there
(== can't be M)").
