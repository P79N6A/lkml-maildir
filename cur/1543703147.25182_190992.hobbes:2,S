Andrew,
Could you please queue this one for your next -mm - first attempt was too
eager at complaining - it's ok to have timeout while we probing ports, etc.
so warnings should only be produced if mouse is in active state.
The patch depends on the one you have.
Dmitry

  Input: Change the way timeouts/parity errors are handled:
         - Only complain about errors from keyboard controller if mouse
           is activated
         - Reset packet count to 0 as the next received byte will most
           likely be the first byte of a new packet
         - If expecting an ACK from the mouse set NACK condition
