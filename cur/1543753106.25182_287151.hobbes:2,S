I think the create timestamp can't hurt things and might be useful in some
cases (e.g. CIFS could use this for exporting, and Lustre will also).  It
would also be useful for some disk "forensics" (term used loosely) unlike
the ctime.  I haven't ever been very keen on nsecond atimes, but it can't
kill us (atime is already flushed at most 1/sec I think).

My thought has always been to use, say, 24 bits for "nseconds>>6" and 8 bits
for "seconds<<32" or something close to this (a few bits either way) to give
us more range on the high end.  In the past we talked of usecond timestamps
(which would have only been 20 bits, leaving 12 bits for seconds msb),
but the kernel ended up using nseconds for the internal timestamps.

You may as well put a macro here to convert from the raw timestamp
(probably shouldn't just be called "nsec" if we are also encoding more
info there, maybe msb_and_ns?) so we can mask (and shift) as necessary.

I don't think this is right.  This means we would only ever store nsec
timestamps if there was already other data in the large inode.  Since
writing that part of the inode is free (we will be writing a full sector
anyways), no reason not to save it.

Macro here also to convert from nsec to the ext3-internal "msb_and_ns" format.

If "s_time_gran" (I haven't seen this before but it doesn't appear to
be a part of your patch) had some useful meaning we could use it to e.g.
shift the nsec part of the timestamps as Andy requested so as not to make
the timestamps change too often.
