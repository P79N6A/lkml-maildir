Nor do I
In that case, the development cycle of the kernel should be a _lot_
shorter. At the rate new "stable" kernels come out we would be waiting
months, if not years for new features to be added. I don't much fancy
having to wait a year for my brand new piece of hardware to be
supported and neither will others so you'll probably just see more
driver development splintering away from the main kernel tree and
being distributed as patches. Not an ideal solution imho.
