Testing, yes. Succeeding, no. It's utterly hosed on SH in its present
condition at least. Presumably it's been tested on at least one platform
with some measure of success, but it's certainly not mine ;-)
I'll get you some patches that fix it up the rest of the way for SH
platforms in the next couple days. There's nothing too rough, though,
mostly serial driver fallout and changes in the current stub that aren't
reflected in the 'new' one.
