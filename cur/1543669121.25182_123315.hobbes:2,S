It does work fine.  I for instance have gcc binary in
/usr/i686-pc-linux-gnu/gcc-bin/3.2 and the libraries
in /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i686-pc-linux-gnu/3.2.2, which works
fine.
You might just have to give --bindir, etc to the exact locations.
Also, make sure you do not have symlinks, etc in /usr/bin, as they
sometimes 'confuses' gcc ...
