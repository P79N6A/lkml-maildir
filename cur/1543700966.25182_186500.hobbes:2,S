Part of this is unrealistic; paging I/O being congested must be due to
paging itself causing seeks without additional I/O load. Reading a
single page once and then faulting that one page back into numerous
process address spaces is only one I/O request, and so cannot seek in
and of itself. So in this scenario, a convoy of processes on a single
page is plausible; aggravated paging I/O seekiness is not. Did you have
in mind some additional I/O load? Or do affected processes actually all
fault before the one I/O completes, and so all block temporarily?

Can you capture sysrq t while a situation like this is in progress?
