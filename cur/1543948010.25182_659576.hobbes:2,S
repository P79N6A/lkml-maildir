Oh, come on! It's userspace, i have scripts managing existence/compression
on per-file basis on my comp. If most distros just drop thousands of useless
(sometimes compressed) stuff to your harddisk, it's not kernel's or
modules-init-tools'
problem.
Also having compressed over compressed stuff, like on initramfs booting image
with such modules (if by defaults) may cause bigger file, more CPU overhead.
It is userspace and all that policy stuff, etc., etc.
Want to make a minidistro on lkml? Well, i see klibc working fine already.
