Subject: IrDA locking fixes for 2.5.X on the way...

	Hi Linus,
	The next few e-mails will contain the "trivial" patches
necessary to get rid of "save_flags(flags);cli();" in the IrDA
stack. I guess you were right, I only needed to add a few spinlocks
left and right.
	I would like those patches to go quickly in 2.5.X, because
they cover lot's of code, so any other changes to the IrDA stack is
likely to make those patches not apply. That's also the reason why I
separated the ALI fixes, as some wanabe IrDA hackers are playing with
it (and creating compile errors).
	The patches go in TWO phases. The first 3 patches are
independant and fixes things needed by the locking fixes. The
remaining 4 patches are also independant but depend on the 3 previous
patches. Patches done and tested on 2.5.32.
	I've got still other patches in my patch queue, and I'll send
that to Jeff in a few weeks.
	Regards,
	Jean
