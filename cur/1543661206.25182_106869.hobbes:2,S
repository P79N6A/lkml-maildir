Choosing the right tool for the right job is an argument that matters
in this context.
Two major type of arguments pop's up when selecting diverse tools:
1) "the right tool for the right job"
2) "the most preferred tool"
My main objective is that argument 2) should _not_ be the rationale
behind adding a new tool to the mandatory tool chain.

The perl scripts used in klibc looks straightforward, expect one that uses
some md5 CPAN module.
Like with C you can in perl pull in a lot of uncommon stuff.
My main objective is to avoid a lot of noise due to one added tool
that may not be required.
Part of the noise will be because people do not understand the
syntax.

One example could be fixdep:
fixdep could have been done in perl as well. Implementing that one
in c does not count as an "perl-to-C" translation.
To repeat my point.
There is only one good reason to add additional tools to the mandatory
set in the tool-chain. At that reason is that the tool is the right
choice, and not just someones favourite.
If that imply a small C utility then fine.

Thanks self. I just want to make sure the technically right choice is taken.
