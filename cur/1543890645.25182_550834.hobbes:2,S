IMO, well-placed #ifdefs are preferrable to dragging non-working code
around. Like:
- put the DMA path in a file only build for MY_STUFF_USE_DMA
- let MY_STUFF select MY_STUFF_USE_DMA if HAS_DMA
- have a header file that points to the implementation for
  MY_STUFF_USE_DMA and uses well defined stubs for !MY_STUFF_USE_DMA,
  like returning ICannotDoThat for check_if_can_do() (kind of like what
  include/linux/sysfs.h does, for example)
This contains the #ifdefs in a header, doesn't compile stuff that won't
work anyway on !HAS_DMA, and adds the ability to disable
MY_STUFF_USE_DMA even if HAS_DMA at a later time if someone wants it.

If it calls broken code, it may not be so "clever" after all :)
What I don't like about this is
- compiles stuff that is not needed on !HAS_DMA
- worse, compiles stuff that will not work on !HAS_DMA
- does not encourage to split code properly into a DMA and a non-DMA
  part
