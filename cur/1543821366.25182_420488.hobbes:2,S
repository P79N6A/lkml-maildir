Sorry , but all the examples that have been given in C++ are clearly
unreadable and impossible to understand. I'd also like to note that
people were arguing about what the code was really doing, this means
that this language is absolutely not suited to such usages where you
want to know the exact behaviour. At least in C, this sort of thing
has never happened. People argue about what must be locked and important
things like this you'd never want the compiler to decide for you.

To be secure, you first have to understand what the code precisely does,
not what it should do depending on how the compiler might optimise it.

I'm still thinking that people who have problems understanding what the
code does want a level of abstraction between them and the CPU so that
the compiler thinks for them. I still don't see the *current* problem
you are trying to fix. Linux is written in C, as many other kernels and
it works. Nobody knows what it would become if rewritten in C++. Maybe
it will be better, maybe it would not run anymore on embedded systems,
maybe it would become fully buggy because nobody except a little bunch
of C++ coders would understand it... At least, I'm sure it will not be
the smart people who currently work on it.
Best of all, I'm even sure that people who are trying to push C++ in
the kernel would never ever write a line of code once it would be
accepted, because they don't seem to know what they're talking about
when it applies to kernel code.
