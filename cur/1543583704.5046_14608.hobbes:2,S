No, you've got it backwards.  The "9 10" result is the *wrong* result.
IEEE 64-bit arithmetic should give the result "10 10".  Also, I can't
duplicate your outcome.  I see no difference linking with "-lieee"
versus linking without it, at least under glibc-2.1.3:
$ gcc -v
Reading specs from /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-linux/2.95.2/specs
gcc version 2.95.2 20000220 (Debian GNU/Linux)
$ cat modified.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <fpu_control.h>
int main()
{
        int a = 10;
        fpu_control_t foo;
        _FPU_GETCW(foo);
        printf("%04x %d %d\n",
                foo,
                (int)( a*.3 +  a*.7),   /* first expression */
                (int)(10*.3 + 10*.7));  /* second expression */
        return 0;
}
$ gcc modified.c && ./a.out
037f 9 10
$ gcc -O2 modified.c && ./a.out
037f 10 10
$ gcc modified.c -lieee && ./a.out
037f 9 10
$ gcc -O2 modified.c -lieee && ./a.out
037f 10 10
$
As you can see, linking with "ieee" has no effect on the control word
setting or the results.  Perhaps this has changed post-glibc 2.1.3?
Looking at the 2.1.3 code, it appears that all "ieee" does is set a
variable that's referenced in the math library innards.  It has no
effect on startup code right now.

Yes.  I know.  In fact, the "fninit" instruction is executed in the
kernel's "init_fpu()" when the first FPU instruction is executed by
the program.  I just think the hardware default happens to be a bad
default on a system where most floating-point software is GCC-compiled
with GCC's 64-bit doubles (and its 64-bit clean but 80-bit dirty
floating point optimizations), so I'm proposing adding an instruction
to "init_fpu()" to change the default hardware control word.

However, this doesn't seem to work.  Nor does "-ffloat-store".
