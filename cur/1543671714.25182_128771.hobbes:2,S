Classic mistake. Lookup tables are only faster in benchmarks, they are
almost always slower in real life. You only need to miss in the cache
_once_ on the lookup to lose all the time you won on the previous one
hundred calls.
"Small and simple" is almost always better than the alternatives. I 
suspect that's one reason why older versions of gcc often generate code 
that actually runs faster than newer versions: the newer versions _look_ 
like they do a better job, but..
