Subject: Why is CONFIG_SCSI_QLA2X_X always enabled?

This has been bugging me for a while.. on pretty much all 2.6 kernel 
configs I've done, the .config has had CONFIG_SCSI_QLA2XXX=y in it, 
regardless of whether or not I have any other SCSI stuff compiled in. Is 
there a reason for this, or is it a bug?
(apologies for the _ in the subject, the lkml server doesn't like XXX in 
the subject..)
