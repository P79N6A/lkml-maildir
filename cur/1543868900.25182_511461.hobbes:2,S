Right now we don't have much that we could do in cpu_relax() on MIPS.
The average CPU core makes extensive use of clock gating to the point
where there are few powersaving knobs left in the core.  Of course I'm
also ignoring things outside the CPU core and clockscaling for which
cpu_relax() would simply be the wrong place.
Of course this driver in rare instances might run on an x86 CPU ...
