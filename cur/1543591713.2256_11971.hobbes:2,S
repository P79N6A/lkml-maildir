this is exactly why I'm saying pci_map_single currently is ugly in
declaring a retval of 0 as an error, because as you also explicitly said
above bus address 0 is perfectly valid bus adress, so my whole point is
that I'd prefer to change the API of pci_map_single to notify of faliure
not returning 0 like it does right now in 2.4.5pre3 and all previous 2.4
kernels but via a parameter, so bus address zero returns a valid bus
address as it should be just now (but it isn't right now).

if a driver is catching the faluire of pci_map_single by checking if the
bus address returned is zero such driver is one of the few (or the only
one) correct driver out there.
As it stands right now a bus address of 0 means pci_map_single failed.
For pci_map_sg if it returns zero it means it failed too.
