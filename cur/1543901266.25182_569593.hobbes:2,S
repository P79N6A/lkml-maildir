so if there are two states for hardware
1. able to be detected and initialized with the standard boot routines
2. ACPI suspend mode, requireing ACPI specifics to wake up
is it possible to detect which is needed? cna you try the ACPI wakeup and 
if it doesn't work go to the standard boot routine (or vice-versa)?

some drivers will have delays on some machines (especially when you 
consider hardware bugs that have to be worked around), but at the moment 
nothing is remotely close to the 'limit' of 60 seconds being talked about 
here.
although with some machines the mear trasnfer times for the data could 
cause noticable delays (if you have a server with 128G of ram it may take 
a while to get it to a drive)
