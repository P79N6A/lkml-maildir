OK, Linus said if I use swap it should be at least twice as much as RAM.
there will be much more discussion about it, for me this contraint is a very
very bad idea.
Have you ever thought about diskless workstations? Swapping over a network
sounds ugly.
Nevertheless, my question is:
what happens if I plan to use no swap. I  have enough memory installed for
my purposes and every swapping operation can do only one thing: slowing down
the system.
Is there a different behaviour if I completely disable swap?
