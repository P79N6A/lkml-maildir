ACPI currently works fine in terms of IRQ routing, sensing when the lid closes 
and the power button gets pressed, telling me how much battery power is left 
and when I disconnect the AC adapter from the wall...
I was hoping software suspend would avoid having to have IBM firmware involved 
in the suspend process at all (it can boot, it can shut down, I just want it 
to snapshot process state so it comes up with the same things up on the 
desktop as last time).
And then if I just get alsa configured I'll have every single thing on my new 
laptop working under 2.6.  (Well, okay, then I'll need to tackle USB.  But 
every single thing I've tried to use so far, anyway. :)
P.S.  I reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeally hate it the way the keys on the keyboard 
sometimes have an up event delayed (or miss it entirely) and decide to 
auto-repeat insanely fast.  It happens about twice an hour.  I've seen mouse 
clicks do it as well.  Not a show-stopper, just annoying.
Okay, once it did it during boot, and the beast was unusable.  X recovers when 
you hit the next key, the console apparently does not.
