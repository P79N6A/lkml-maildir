All of the congestion variables are maintained in terms of packets.
The function you quote, tcp_cong_avoid(), determines if we increase
the congestion window exponentially (when snd_cwnd is less than or
equal to snd_ssthresh) or linearlly (when snd_cwnd is more than
snd_ssthresh).
This is bog-standard Van Jacobson congestion avoidance, nothing fancy.
