UPDATE:
Out of curiosity and because it seemed to be the interrupt handling
that was problematic, I disabled "Local APIC support on uniprocessors."
That convinced the machine to boot with ACPI.
Here is an excerpt from dmesg regarding ACPI only:
[...]

This looks pretty good, I think. Already checked some
funcionality. Suspend to RAM seems to work, although the display
remains dark on restart (but normal shutdown works, so the machine is
definitely back up).
So the problem we've been seeing seems to be related to the
interaction between local APIC support and ACPI.
I hope this helps tracking it down...
Regards,
Georg
P.S. Martin? Can you reproduce this?
