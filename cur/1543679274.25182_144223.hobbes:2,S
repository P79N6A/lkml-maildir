   Hardly difficult. I found what appears to be a pretty complete
35-page document on the structure of the FAT filesystem in about 10
seconds with Google. ext2 was a little tricker to find, but eventually
I got to the sourceforge project for e2fsprogs.

   And quite rightly. Take small steps, moving towards your ultimate
goal. Don't try to get a perfect system working immediately -- you
_will_ fail (unless you're some previously unsung übercoder, in which
case you'll merely find it insanely difficult :) ).
