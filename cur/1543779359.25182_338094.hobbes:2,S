And there are older machines that won't boot with it enabled. The machine
I'm typing this on has a really shitty ACPI implementation, I don't remember
the details because it's been so long but I know that I have to disable ACPI 
for it to work right.
I'm not saying defconfig should never be changed, but changing what can and
will cause noticeable breakage should be avoided if possible. And in this
case it doesn't seem to me that the benefits of changing HZ in the middle
of a "stable" series outweigh the added latency.
