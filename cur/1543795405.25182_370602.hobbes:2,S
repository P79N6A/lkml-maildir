Nope.
Getting a per board chip select to DIMM mapping is fairly easy, you
just need a lookup table of:
(memory_controller, chip_select, channel, dimm_label)
Which if the motherboard vendor does not give it to you is pretty
straight forward to discover just by plugging a minimal memory configuration
into various slots.  We can already query in software what the
motherboard is so keeping a table like this in user space is
not a problem.

The problem is not detection but compensating for how it changes
the address.
I do agree that it would be nice if there was a standard for
BIOS's reporting this information.  In LinuxBIOS it is one of
those TODO list items we never quite get to.  But so far a user
space table has proved quite useful in practice.
