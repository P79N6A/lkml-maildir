Do you have documentation which verifies that A20 is enabled by the time 
the IN instruction returns?  If not, you probably don't want to jump to 
a20_done, but rather fall into a loop like the following:
#if defined(CONFIG_MELAN)
	inb $0xee, %al
a20_elan_wait:
	call a20_test
	jz a20_elan_wait
	jmp a20_done
#endif
Furthermore, I would still like to argue that this does not belong into 
"processor type and features", because all of these are *chipset* 
issues; in fact, in this particular case you're more than anything 
working around a BIOS bug (not having INT 15h AX=2401h do the right thing).
I'm also very uncomfortable with putting this where you do; I think it 
should be put before a20_kbc instead.  If the BIOS is implemented 
correctly, it should be used.
