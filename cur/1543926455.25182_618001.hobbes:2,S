(added Ingo to CC: list:  maybe this is some weird interaction with CFS
and jiffies being reset to 0 on resume ??)
I can try it, but it won't help debug the problem much.
Remember, this happens very inconsistently, maybe 3-4 times a day,
or not at all for 3-4 days.
But if somebody has a specific bug-fix patch that could explain this,
then I'll happily apply it here.
Cheers
