Jeff,
I'm submitting a patch series for inclusion in 2.6.24 for the cxgb driver.
The patches are built against Linus'git tree.
Here is a brief description:
- Ensure that GSO skbs have enough headroom before encapsulating them,
- Fix a crash in NAPI mode,
- Fix statistics accounting and report.
Cheers,
Divy
