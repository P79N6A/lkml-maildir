That's a really bad assumption.  There WILL eventually be a time when
this is no longer true, so something should be done now to head this
off.  Adding a GFP_DMAPCI or whatever, even if it only currently maps to
another value, will make life a whole lot easier when we start seeing
systems with >4G memory with 32-bit PCI cards.  And what about other
arches besides Intel?
