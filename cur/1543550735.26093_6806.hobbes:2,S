According to the documentation I have,
	6 	 PAE
	14 	 Machine Check Architecture
	17 	 PSE-36 (Page Size Extensions)
I don't know if we also potentially detect
	9 	 APIC
since I don't have a source tree handy.
The Duron should return 0x0183f9ff (or possibly 0x0183fbff if the BIOS
enables the APIC) in EDX from CPUID with EAX==1, so bits 6, 14 and 17
should be reported as set.
I don't know what PSE-36 is, but it appears on all Athlons but Model 1.
It is apparently different from bit 3, "Page Size Extensions (4-Mbyte pages).
