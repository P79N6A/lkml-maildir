A) udev changing its interface every three months isn't the kernel's fault, 
it's udev's.  Heck,  udev doesn't even accept a dependency on an external 
libsys but instead bundles its own copy in there because obviously the proper 
way to use a shared library is to block copy it into the source tree of every 
potential user.  Its config file format keeps changing.  What commands you 
run to invoke it keeps changing.  What does that have to do with the kernel?
Attached is a shell script that does the basics of what udev does.  (No, it 
doesn't handle permissions or persistent naming.  But it also doesn't show a 
lot of version dependencies, does it?)
B) When I install new packages I have to update dependencies like SDL or zlib 
all the time, yet you believe the kernel isn't allowed to have dependencies?  
Not even on things like modprobe or glibc that interface to the kernel not 
just graphically but "with tongue", as it were?  (Despite that, they're 
pretty darn good at staying compatible anyway.)

Oh don't start throwing around "must" and "officially announced" as if those 
terms actually mean something.
If you can come up with a compelling proposal and implement it and attract 
followers, fine.  You don't need to grab a flag and get blessed by somebody 
else to do anything.  (Whose flag and blessing did Linus get way back when?  
And where the heck did Ubuntu or Gentoo come from?)
The _right_ way to do this would have been to announce that you are 
maintaining a new tree, a -stable fork of whatever release, and give a URL to 
where it can be downloaded.  Announce code, not intentions.  (Announcing 
intentions never works.  Code attracts code and talk attracts talk.)  And that 
way the difficulty and sustainability of your task becomes self-apparent.
By the way, I'll guarantee you I can configure a 2.6.15 kernel that your 
userspace won't work with, with no code changes.  (To start with, I'd yank 
elf and force you to use a.out executable format...)
