This is getting comical.
According to my records, the patch
voyager-fix-build-broken-by-shift-to-smp_ops.patch _is_ Jeremy's patch. 
James forwarded it.
I take it from your statement that we should merge some Jeremy-patch other
than this Jeremy-patch?
If "yes", than could Jeremy please resend the other patch(es) (I believe there
are multiple patches involved) and then can James please test them?
If "no" then I think I'll just go shopping.
