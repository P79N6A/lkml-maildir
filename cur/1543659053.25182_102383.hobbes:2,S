I can explain what happened with Unisys GPL: Unisys intended to give the
souce out under GPL, but we didn't know exactly how to do this. So, we just
copied the clauses from some other source (I believe it was some IBM
authored file) and used it. Even though it looked like a good way to go,
SuSE asked us to fix some wording so it serve better to expression of GPL. I
realize that when it come to companies not individuals giving out their code
under GPL, all sorts of problems can come up and everyone is understandably
careful... 
Well, maybe, someone needs to establish an unquestionable wording so
everyone can use it. We would be happy to change our license any time to
make it compliant.

It compiles parts of openssl which explicitly have a license that conflicts
with the GPL when CONFIG_PPP=y.  The bsd_comp stuff was only compilable as
module.

I don't think this clause is GPL-compliant.  But I'm not a lawyer, so..
