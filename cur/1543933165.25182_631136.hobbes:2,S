yep, and i ran a quick comparison test on a 2-core box with 3 kernels:
  [ best of 5 runs in a row which had a relative jitter of less than 10% ]
     MIN      v2.6.24.slab     v2.6.24.slub v2.6.24.slub.fix
  ----------------------------------------------------------
           mmap:    429.00    402.00 ( -6%)    385.00 (-10%)
         select:     11.38     10.46 ( -8%)     11.41 (  0%)
      proc-exec:    121.52    116.77 ( -3%)    120.77 (  0%)
      proc-fork:    106.84    106.19 (  0%)    107.92 (  1%)
   syscall-open:      3.09      3.13 (  1%)      3.25 (  4%)
   hackbench-50:      2.85      3.47 ( 21%)      2.88 (  1%)
and the regression seems to be largely fixed! Not only is the hackbench 
one fixed, but mmap shows an above-noise improvement as well.
