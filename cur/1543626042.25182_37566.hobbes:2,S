  I just did a "man 3 pthreads" and that capability is listed as
available... If you can boil it down to a small test program as I did,
I'll run it on Linux and Solaris and see what I see.
  Of course Linux doesn't implement anything here, you choose the
implementation by pthreads lib and includes, the old MIT user-level one,
the so-called "Linux threads" model, or the current NGPT model in current
kernels and the library from IBM.
  The latter work, at least for some definitions of "work," but I know
there are some differences.
  I don't see why starting two threads at different priorities when the
program does init is enough overhead to notice, but I don't have your
program so you may need something inobvious.
