Alan added comment to my posting that my problems are caused by
messed up IRQ routing on that box I tried.  Indeed, I can boot
kernel 2.6.20-1.2962.fc7, which really is 2.6.21-rc2, provided
I will use 'acpi=off irqpoll'.  Anything else and a boot silently
dies if 'acpi=off' is skipped or is not finding disk if 'irqpoll'
is missing.
Somehow 2.6.19 is booting on the same hardware without "valliant
efforts"; OTOH 'ahci' driver was not used there.
