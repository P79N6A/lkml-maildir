As I wrote last week dma_wait_for_completion won't hack G2 DMA:
147 void dma_wait_for_completion(unsigned int chan)
148 {
149         struct dma_info *info = get_dma_info(chan);
150         struct dma_channel *channel = &info->channels[chan];
151 
152         if (channel->flags & DMA_TEI_CAPABLE) {
153                 wait_event(channel->wait_queue,
154                            (info->ops->get_residue(channel) == 0));
155                 return;
156         }
157 
158         while (info->ops->get_residue(channel))
159                 cpu_relax();
160 }
get_residue never returns 0 for G2 DMA. When the dma is complete get_residue returns the size of the total transfer. Therefore I've no choice but to write my own handler (spinlocks question aside).
