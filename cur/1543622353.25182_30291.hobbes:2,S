would you use Java as your means of illustrating particular concepts?
The reason I ask is that I find fault with the course I'm currently
taking because the text that our curriculum is based on does just this. 
Now, granted, we have written some C code during labs, but that doesn't
cut it for me.
I realize I'm no Linus or Alan (yet ;-), but I think you can understand
where I'm coming from on this particular issue.
Sorry if this message is a bit off-topic, but I figured the folks on
this list would be able to generate some insightful comments.
