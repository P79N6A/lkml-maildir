i've seen this before, it's still unsolved. This trace shows it nicely:

this is either a false positive, or we missed a preemption. To see which
one, could you apply the attached patch and try to reproduce this long
trace? The new trace will tell us whether need_resched is set during
that ~1 msec window.
