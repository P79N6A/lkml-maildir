This is called a launcher or wrapper. Your process just has to fork/exec
the process to monitor, and it receives a sigchild when that one dies.
One well-known process does that all the time, it's called init :-)
But this does not save you from checking that your processes are properly
working. A process which just dies is the trivial case. Most unhandled
errors are from stuck processes, which need to be killed and respawned.
So if you have to check that a process is working correctly and you can
kill it, it's often easy to restart it, and you don't need your wrapper.
You're back to the script you found inefficient ;-)
