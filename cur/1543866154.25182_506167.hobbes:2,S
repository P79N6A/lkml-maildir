Some uli controllers have simplex bit stuck high indicating that they
can't perform DMA transfers simultaneously on both channels.  In this
case, libata configures the second channel as PIO only.  This has been
worked around by the following commit.

    libata: implement ATA_FLAG_IGN_SIMPLEX and use it in sata_uli
    Some uli controllers have stuck SIMPLEX bit which can't be cleared
    with ata_pci_clear_simplex(), but the controller is capable of doing
    DMAs on both channels simultaneously.  Implement ATA_FLAG_IGN_SIMPLEX
    which makes libata ignore the simplex bit and use it in sata_uli.

For quick fix, just comment out lines which set ATA_HOST_SIMPLEX in
drivers/scsi/libata-bmdma.c.  e.g.
	/*if (inb(bmdma + 2) & 0x80)
		probe_ent->host_set_flags |= ATA_HOST_SIMPLEX;*/
