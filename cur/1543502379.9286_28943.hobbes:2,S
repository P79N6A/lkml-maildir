Crap, I keep blowing it with the the linux-kernel address.

Yeah, I wasn't sure what the specifics are with this, which is why I was
trying to read the source to Enlightenment to see how the window manager is
dealing with window exposure, dirty rectangles (for Mac folks), etc...

Yeah, I suspect so, but I believe that if the X draw queue would remove all
redraw events until a time period N, or until a mouse up that would allow
for less blocking going with X during moves and resizing. Most of the event
blocking that bothers me comes from big operations like foreground/background
window movement/resizing that perform some kind of time sucking window
updating.
I don't know the specifics of this and you seem to know more about the
internals of this kind of stuff.
Give me a couple of weeks. ;-)

Yeah, I think you'd see a significant increase in smoothness and responsiveness
if the frequency of redraw events was reduced for this particular operation.
It's a cheap hack that might improve certain things dramatically.
Who knows.

Yeah, me too on both of the above points.
