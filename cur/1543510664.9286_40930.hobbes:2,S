Hi,
This afternoon I upgraded my slackware 3.6 system to kernel
2.2.12 (updated all packages as listed in Documentation/Changes
(only if they were older then the minimum version mentioned in
that text-file)).
Since then, every time I rebooted the system, I got massive file-
system errors.
fsck gives errors like:
Sep 26 17:44:12 keetweej kernel: EXT2-fs error (device ide0(3,65)):
ext2_check_blocks_bitmap: Block #252 of the inode table in group 0 is
marked free 
After that, I installed an older version 2.2.7 which I already
had on an other system and didn't give any problems. That didn't
solve the problem. Switching back then to 2.0.38 also didn't solve
the problem. Only after I booted up with 2.0.38, explicitly unmounted
everything except /, and did an explicit fsck on those unmounted file-
systems (giving lots of other problems :-/), things seems to be working
fine again. I rebooted a few more times (with a forced fsck everytime)
and did some massive disk-access (expire of news-server).
The system:
p90 with 32MB ram, 2 x 1GB HD, plato mobo, rz1000 bug on mobo (yes, I
did
switch on that thing in make xconfig).
Furthermore:
/lib/libc-2.0.7.so*       /lib/libc.so.5.4.46*      /lib/libcurses.so.0@
/lib/libc.so.4@           /lib/libc.so.6@          
/lib/libcurses.so.0.1.2*
/lib/libc.so.4.7.6*       /lib/libcom_err.so.2@     /lib/libcurses.so.1@
/lib/libc.so.5@           /lib/libcom_err.so.2.0*  
/lib/libcurses.so.1.0.0*
/lib/libc.so.5.4.44*      /lib/libcurses.so@
Anyone any suggestions?
