It's rather simple:
- "timer API" vs "timeout API": I got absolutely no acknowlegement that 
this might be a little confusing and in consequence "process timer" may be 
a better name.
- I pointed out various (IMO) unnecessary complexities, which were rather 
quickly brushed off e.g. with a need for further (not closer specified) 
cleanups.
- resolution handling: at what resolution should/does the kernel work and 
what do we report to user space. The spec allows multiple interpretations 
and I have a hard time to get at least one coherent interpretation out of 
Thomas.
Maybe I'm the only one who found Thomas answers a little superficial, but 
as this is a central kernel subsystem I think it deserves a closer look 
and everytime I tried to poke a little deeper I got nothing.
bye, Roman
