You're a funny guy. While I don't care what happens to this patch 
because I took it from Andrea Arcangeli (IIRC), I am not so sure what 
exactly you mean by "I place my contributions to this patch under the 
GPL". But I don't care either. I only hope people are not bugging you 
for any breakage. ;)
I think NVIDIA would have the right to take portions of this patch 
wheter you like it or not. I don't think they want to, however.

It doesn't really matter, it's for 2.5.x anyway. Besides that it should 
actually be called rage ;).
Best regards,
Roberto Nibali, ratz
