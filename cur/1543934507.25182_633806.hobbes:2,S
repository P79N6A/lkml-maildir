hm. This passes in 4 arguments to do_warn_on().
i think we could get away with no arguments (!), by using section 
tricks. Firstly, we can get rid of __FUNCTION__ and replace it with a 
ksyms lookup - that is fine enough. Secondly, we could put __FILE__ and 
__LINE__ into a text section and key it up to the return address from 
do_warn_on().
the condition code should not be passed in at all i think - it creates 
extra function calls to do_warn_on() all the time.
