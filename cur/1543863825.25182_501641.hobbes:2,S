Good point! Of late I've been working on single-user systems, so it
was not at the front of my brain, despite years of building and using
multi-user systems.
It's a point that multi-user systems have struggled with forever (when
somebody inserts a CR in the drive mounted in the system box, which
user do you pop up a media player for?).
I tend to think it's not a kernel-vs-user-space issue, though. To
solve it you need, somewhere, a notion of a "user session" and you
need some way to separate system-level issues (like low-battery) from
user-level issues (like activiating user X's screensaver).
