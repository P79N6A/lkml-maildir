I think there's some vague ambition in there to support non-identical CPUs.
In which case reading from the local CPU would make more sense.  (waves
frantically at cpufreq developers).
otoh, it'll take some work I suspect.  It'll need to sort out the overall
scope of "local cpu".  At what point and for how long should this code pin
itself on a cpu?
