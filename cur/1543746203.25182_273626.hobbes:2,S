Subject: [PATCH 2.6.10-rc2 0/4] module sysfs: module sysfs related clean ups
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

 Hello,
 These are four patches to simplify/clean up implementation of module
sysfs stuff.
01_mkobj_inline.patch
	Make module.mkobj inline.  As this is simpler and what's
	usually done with kobjs when it's representing an entity.
02_module_attribute_extension.patch
	Modify module_attribute show/store methods to accept self
	argument to enable further extensions.
03_module_sections_attr_grp.patch
	Reimplement section attributes using attribute group.  This
	makes more sense, for, while they reside in a separate
	subdirectory, they belong to the ownig module and their
	lifetime exactly equals the lifetime of the owning module,
	and it's simpler.
04_module_paramters_attr_grp.patch 
	Reimplement parameter attributes using attribute group.
	Ditto.
 Thanks.
