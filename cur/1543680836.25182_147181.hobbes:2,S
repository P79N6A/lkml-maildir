My personal paranoia when reading code goes the other way: How can I be
sure it wonŽt ever be NULL?  Maybe it can't be now (and to find that out an
hour grepping around goes by), but the very next patch introduces the
possibility.  Better have the function do an extra check, or make sure
somehow the assumption won't _ever_ be violated. But that is a large (huge,
even) cost, so...
