Same question as before: Can baud really become zero at this point ? Also
for that matter what guarantees that t1 cannot become zero in this
computation ?

The check for B0 (hangup) was done earlier (see set_termios). So if you
can end up with a requested baud rate being turned into 0 you need to
bump it up to 1. If not you don't need the test.
