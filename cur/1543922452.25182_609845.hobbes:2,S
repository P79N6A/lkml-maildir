this isn't a valid case afaics; even on "traditional x86" (before we
changed the address space layout, or even today if you have an
unlimited stack rlimit) this isn't going to work. applications really
shouldn't use (s)brk() but malloc(); you have to be able to fall back
to mmap regardless of what you do.
