It should call zap_page_range not zeromap_page_range.
zap_page_range removes mappings; zeromap_page_range creates COW zero
maps (cf. MAP_ANONYMOUS, /dev/zero).
However, this is handled for you in munmap().  As long as you have any
mapping of the device, there will be a reference to its inode.  The
final call to the inode's release() will happen after the last reference
is removed, at which point all the mappings have been removed anyway.
