And FWIW, not everyone has your scripts or the time to use them. The
init_self(x) thinging (and yes I hate that name) can be made to be a
compile time option.  So for those that are writing code, and only want to
look at the warnings that effect them, they have an option to turn off the
warnings of others (marked as false positives only). Heck, make the false
positives on as the default, and let others turn it off when developing.
I am one that spent several hours debugging my code, looking for a bug
that was caused by an "uninitialized variable".  The problem was, that I
became so damn use to ignoring those warnings, that I ignored them in my
own code.  I'm now a little more careful, but it still takes more time to
notice if those warnings are in code that I changed, or not.

And IMO it solves it for you.  Not for everyone else.  Really, the only
argument that I see you have is the ugliness of the macro.  Since it can
be made configureable whether or not it disables those warnings, it
shouldn't affect you in any other way.  But it will really help those that
want to skip those warnings while looking at the compile output of their
code while they are developing it.
