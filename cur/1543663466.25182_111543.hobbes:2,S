Yes. via-kt400.c was unnecessary (well, it was useful as a standalone
whilst I was developing it) , which was why it was later merged into
via-agp.c in 2.5.60. There were also a bunch of other fixes merged
there, so if you based your backport on an earlier version, I suggest
you grab those changes.
