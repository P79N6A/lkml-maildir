I much prefer how Nick has it, with vma passed separately as a regular
argument.  details is for packaging up some details only required in
unlikely circumstances, normally it's NULL and not filled in at all.
You can argue that (vma->vm_flags & VM_RESERVED) is precisely that
kind of detail.  But personally I find it rather odd that vma isn't
an explicit argument to zap_pte_range already - I find it very useful
when trying to shed light on the rmap.c:BUG, for example.
There might be a case for packaging repeated arguments into structures
(though several of these levels are inlined anyway), but that's some
other exercise entirely, shouldn't get in the way of removing Reserved.
