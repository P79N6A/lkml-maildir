I wouldn't say I moved RAM and it just started crashing - I also did an
upgrade from RedHat 6.2 w/ 2.4.17 kernel to a stock (and patched) RedHat
7.3 setup. I was suspecting maybe the kernel fix didn't work or
something - but it does register as 2.4.18-5.... I suppose that is just
wishful thinking so we don't have to swap out the machine.
At this point it seems clear I need to swap out the hardware, if not for
any other reason because it is a production machine so I can't run
memtest 86 just yet. 
On the new machine I suppose I will run the stock RedHat kernel. If the
replacement crashes, perhaps I will switch kernels and see if it
persists.
Thanks for your reply-
