since i was the one who submitted the original patch to remove that
stuff, let me make an observation.
when i submitted a patch to remove, for instance, the traffic shaper
since it's clearly obsolete, i was told -- in no uncertain terms --
that that couldn't be done since there had been no warning about its
impending removal.
fair enough, i can accept that.
on the other hand, the features removal file contains the following:
...
What:   PCMCIA control ioctl (needed for pcmcia-cs [cardmgr, cardctl])
When:   November 2005
...
in other words, the PCMCIA ioctl feature *has* been listed as obsolete
for quite some time, and is already a *year and a half* overdue for
removal.
in short, it's annoying to take the position that stuff can't be
deleted without warning, then turn around and be reluctant to remove
stuff for which *more than ample warning* has already been given.
doing that just makes a joke of the features removal file, and makes
you wonder what its purpose is in the first place.
a little consistency would be nice here, don't you think?
