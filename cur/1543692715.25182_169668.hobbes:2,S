I've had the keyboard for around a year, and I've been mostly using 
gentoo-sources kernels from Gentoo, which are certainly not vanilla kernels. 
Perhaps they had some patch applied. Though, I think I used 2.4.21 vanilla 
previous to development kernels.

I only saw the message from earlier in the day about multimedia keyboards 
after I posted, so sorry for the repetition. I think I need to do some 
reading on keycodes and scancodes. Thanks very much for your help.
