Subject: [PATCH-2.4] Disable APIC on reboot.

Marcelo,
This patch allows my VAIO to reboot with LOCAL_APIC enabled. I too have a
broken BIOS which cannot put hardware into a sane state at boot, and it hangs
on IDE detection if the kernel left LOCAL_APIC enabled. Now with this patch
upon 2.4.22-rc2, it's OK, so I can enable LOCAL_APIC again. Do you find it too
late for 2.4.22 ? Depending on how we see it, it may be considered as a
workaround for broken BIOSes, or as a bugfix for a kernel which didn't restore
hardware into its original state. Or at least, please accept it for 2.4.23-pre1.
I rediffed it against 2.4.22-rc2, and attached the patch at the end of this
mail.
Cheers,
Willy
