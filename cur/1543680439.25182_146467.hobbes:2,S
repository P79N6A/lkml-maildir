direct_IO() was precisely such a conditional hook definition. It
appeared in 2.4.15, and anybody who does not check for
KERNEL_HAS_O_DIRECT is not backward compatible.
To comment further: There is at least one example I can think of which
was exactly equivalent to the proposed change, namely the redefinition
of the filldir_t type in 2.4.9. It was admittedly not documented using
a define...
Note: We could at the same time replace the name direct_IO() with
direct_IO2() (that has several precedents).  There are currently only
a small number of filesystems that provide O_DIRECT, and converting
them all is (as has been pointed out before) trivial...
The problem with read_inode2() was rather that it overloaded the the
existing iget4() interface...
Cheers,
  Trond
