What is the best way to create a kernel semaphore that will time out after
so many clock ticks?
The normal kernel semaphore code doesn't provide a timeout value, if you
wait it is assumed to be OK to wait forever.
One of the things I would like to do with such a semaphore is to implement a
timeout on DMA transfers, such that if the transfer doesn't complete in so
much time it will give up. I would also like to implement some simple device
locking using it.
