Hum. I remember suggesting the fix when this came few weeks back,
somehow the older version seems to have made it into Linus' tree.

Replacing mutex_lock_interruptible() with a mutex_lock() could be a
change in behaviour visible to userspace. Best to continue to use
_interruptible. Returning EINTR would be safe choice because if
Simon's right that this isn't retried, we could end up breaking
userspace that isn't quite ready to see ERESTARTSYS coming out of
a write(2), but ...

Right, several others in drivers/char/ do return ERESTARTSYS. Hope
somebody picks this up -- no email listed in MAINTAINERS for this.

Check the return of mutex_lock_interruptible() in drivers/char/rocket.c
and return ERESTARTSYS if we were interrupted.
