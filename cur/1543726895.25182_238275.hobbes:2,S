I strongly agree. Also, access to VGA memory (in case that is necessary)
should be provided via MMAP on this driver too.
There are other reasons than master aborts to go that way, like platforms
that have multiple PCI domains with separate IO spaces that can accomodate
VGA cards in several of them.
