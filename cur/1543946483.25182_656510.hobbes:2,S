Can you confirm whether you're getting TCP checksum errors on the other
side that is receiving packets from the 5701?  You can just check
statistics using netstat -s.  I suspect that after we turn off SG,
checksum is no longer offloaded and we are getting lots of TCP checksum
errors instead that are slowing the performance.
