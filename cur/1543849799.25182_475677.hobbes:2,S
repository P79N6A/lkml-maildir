Subject: [PATCH] Quieten Freezer if !CONFIG_PM_DEBUG
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The freezer currently prints an '=' for every process that is frozen.
This is pretty pointless, as the equals sign says nothing about which
process is frozen, and makes logs look messier (especially if there were
a large number of processes running). All we really need to know is that
we started trying to freeze processes and what processes (if any) failed
to freeze, or that we succeeded.
