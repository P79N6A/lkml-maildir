I can also confirm this link error.  The problem occurs when compiling
either 2.6.28.1 or 2.6.27.12; I didn't try anything earlier.  The patch
suggested at this beginning of this thread did solve the link problem
and the resulting kernel ran for several hours.  However, I think the
patch is still probably incorrect.
I'm going to repost what I said in another message I sent today, this
time with a wider audience:
The problem is that the name "sigprocmask" is getting renamed to
"kernel_sigprocmask" by a compiler directive in arch/um/Makefile, then
that name gets mangled into "sys_kernel_sigprocmask" by the
SYSCALL_DEFINE3(sigprocmask, ...) macro in kernel/signal.c.
So, instead of the patch suggested earlier, I added the following line
to arch/um/sys-i386/sys_call_table.S:
#define sys_sigprocmask sys_kernel_sigprocmask
This made it compile and link correctly.  Look at the symbols generated
by the compile of signal.c to see what I mean:
# nm kernel/signal.o | grep sigprocmask
0000008f r __kstrtab_kernel_sigprocmask
00000040 r __ksymtab_kernel_sigprocmask
00001ea6 T kernel_sigprocmask
00002d67 T sys_kernel_sigprocmask
00001faf T sys_rt_sigprocmask
Unfortunately, it's a mystery to me that others haven't run into this
before.  My host environment is RHEL 4 inside some kind of chroot.
