I think it is in Debian (unstable at least).
More important to me is getting it into Red Hat and SuSE. I have heard
encouring words from Matt Wilson at Red Hat about schedutils possibly
going into Rawhide soon. It would not hurt to let Red Hat/SuSE/whoever
know that schedutils is something their customers want.
Both Red Hat and SuSE's kernels have the CPU affinity system calls
merged, so you do not need to wait until 2.6 is out to use them.
