I have a feeling that we will have a lot of network related fixes post
2.4.32 (IPVS, IPv6, mcast...). Marcelo, perhaps it would be a good idea
to merge them in early 2.4.33-pre1 so that competent users have enough
time to test them ? As Roberto explained it, some of the fixes need
hours or days of testing, and some of them are used by only a bunch of
people around the world.

OK, I will put my nose there.

Working half of my time in the same area, I've been starting to consider
since 2.4.31 that 2.4 is becoming very stable and ready for production use
in those sensible environments. Having small kernels updates which don't
break PaX compatibility every two weeks is also a very good thing when
seeking for enhanced security on servers ;-)

Willy
