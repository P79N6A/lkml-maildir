No, it doesn't.  You can monitor the latency using realfeel or realfeel2
from 
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/amlat.tar.gz
But that won't tell you _why_ large latencies are occurring.   For that,
you'll need to apply
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/2.5/2.5.54/2.5.54-mm3/experimental/rtc-debug.patch
and run `amlat'.  This combination will spit out stack backtraces whenever
there is a 2 millisecond scheduling overrun.

That's not suitable for this work.  intlat is OK for locating and
measuring interrupts-off code paths.   But it's a bit hard to drive.
