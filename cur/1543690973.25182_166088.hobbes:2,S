This is what I hate about EMail.  You had two choices here: either I
don't understand you, or you don't understand me.  You chose wrong,
and wasted a lot of time on an (excellent, BTW) explanation.
I wasn't clear: __set_task_state() and __set_current_state() should
not exist, they are assignments.  set_task_state() should not exist,
since it's only used for current anyway.  set_current_state should be
split into set_current_interruptible() and
set_current_uninterruptible(), except...

have excellent wait_event, wait_event_interruptible and
wait_event_interruptible_timeout macros in wait.h which these drivers
should be using, which would make them simpler, less buggy and
smaller.
Hope that clarifies?
Rusty.
