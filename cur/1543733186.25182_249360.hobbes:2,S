yes it absolutely is quite a heavy hammer. 
However right now the alternative (free a LOT of memory and hope it
collapses into higher order ones) is even heavier, freeing the wrong 8 pages
is less of a disturbance than freeing 8000 of the mostly wrong pages ;) 
I absolutely agree this heavy hammer only should trigger if there is a
request for a higher order page that isn't there. Doing it from a special
thread does make sense, makes it relatively easy to keep track of such
wakeups and more importantly rate limit them etc.
