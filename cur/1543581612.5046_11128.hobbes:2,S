Thanks Alan - spot on. I ran this and there's been a permissions change to
/bin/login a couple of days ago. I smell a hacker... ?
Firstly - GRRRRRRRRRRRR.
Secondly, to get the thing running I'm assuming I can copy a working login
binary from an identical server, so I can get in & change the passwords and
sort the security out?
I'm thinking it's not a coincidence that my system logs disappeared either..
:(
