Yes this (MAC address) is the only general way of doing it.
For ethernet cards (or anything else) on the PCI bus you can use
the following to specify an order:
ftp://platan.vc.cvut.cz/pub/linux/pciorder.patch-2.4.12-ac1.gz
This allows you to pass the following parameter to the kernel:
pciorder=Bus:Node.Fn,Bus:Node.Fn,... e.g.
pciorder=0:0d.0,0:0b.0,0:0a.0
