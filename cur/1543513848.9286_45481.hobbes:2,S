DAD is _very_ important. I tried to explain earlier hat proposed
patch does not make DAD. It makes some optional network monitoring task.

Wow! Please, make "du -s /usr/src/linux". Or even look at size of binary
kernel image. And imagine, you need access to network to install it.
There is no difference between kernel and user level "applications"
except for one: you must be really careful when programming inside kernel
and have no rights to make mistakes. That's all. And not to make
mistakes you have to keep desk clean.
