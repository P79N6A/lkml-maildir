Couldn't it just do:
sigset_t new;
sigset_t savemask;
sigfillset (&new);
sigprocmask (SIG_BLOCK, &new, &savemask);
kill(-1, STOP);
for(each proc with p.sid!=my_sid) kill(proc, sig);
kill(-1, CONT);
sigprocmask (SIG_SETMASK, &savemask, (sigset_t *) 0);
... in other words, block signals, do the killing, then unblock?
