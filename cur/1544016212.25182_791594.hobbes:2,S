Yes, I saw that in archive, but did not receive myself, so did not
answer. This works in the above simple case, but if we dig a little bit
into the case when there are children, parent has to live and not all
children should be considered equal by the oom-killer, things change
dramatially. And we can not change the sources. Well, in particaular my
case we can, but it is not about the single system :)

Yup, this whole thread shows this resistance quite good :)

I tried, and although I do agree on the fact that it can be used to turn
oom-killer on or off, but not for the tuning. But even this does not
really work in the case showed, when we can not change the application,
and having a main goal to save the parent and kill only some subset of
the short-living children. So we can not really adjust parent oom-score
and get the same in the children, since this will put parent and
important children at risk.

Let's put containers out of the picture. While it may or may not work,
they are definitely not an issue in the given systems. Having simpler
tunables would be great, but we can not change them, since it is
already existing abi, documentation could be extended though, I can
cook up a patch tomorrow if no one else will do this.
