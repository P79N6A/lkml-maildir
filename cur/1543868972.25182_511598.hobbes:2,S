Hi,
And now, for something completely different, no libata ;-)
I was wondering if any of you ever got the sky2 driver working
(gigabit network card found in most Siemens E laptops).
Which kernel I am trying, 2.6.17-gentoo (the kernel on the install
CD), 2.6.20, the latest gits, nothing works. It either tells me "Link
not ready" when bringing the interface up or it just gives massive
time outs.
Then, after literaly 6 reboots, it might get a DHCPACK, work, till the
next reboot, then same story all over again.
Any clue towards module settings or patches are welcome,
At the moment I am compiling Jeff's netdev upstream-linus.
Patrick
