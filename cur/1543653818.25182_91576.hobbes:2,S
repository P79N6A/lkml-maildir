MD doesn't, raidreconf does but not online.

Yes, it would.  It's not impossible, just difficult.

Well, merging the two would actually be rather a simple task I think since 
you would still keep each md mode a separate module, the only difference 
might be some inter-communication call backs between LVM and MD, but even 
those aren't necessarily required.  The prime benefit I would see from 
making the two into one is being able to integrate all the disparate 
superblocks into a single superblock format that helps to avoid any 
possible startup errors between the different logical mapping levels.
