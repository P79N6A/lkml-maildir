Actually it is ACPI PCI-IRQ routing which has been broken since 2.5.8-pre3; 
the next acpi-release ( 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/acpi/
 ) will include 
updates for that feature. For the time being, you might try one of my 
patches:
x v.9 or v.12 [for acpi-20020404(*)] of my ACPI-PIC-pci-irq 
rewrite, which is available at
http://www.brodo.de/english/pub/acpi/pci_irq/
or
x "Do not use IRQ 1" at 
http://www.brodo.de/english/pub/acpi/20020404/bugfixes.html

(*) acpi-20020404 got merged into 2.5.8-pre3
