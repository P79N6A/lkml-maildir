(I haven't tested anything but...) why should this fix it?  Ulrich's
problem happens when the .o file is flushed from the cache, and then
stat'd; it now appears to be older than the .c file.  With a change to
round up instead, if the .c file is flushed from the cache before the
.o, the .c will still suddenly appear to be newer than the .o.
