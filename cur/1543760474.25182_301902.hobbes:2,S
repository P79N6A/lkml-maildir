I disagree.  If there's a simple, obvious, small fix that passes all the 
other criteria, it should go into -stable ASAP after passing review. 
Then the -stable maintainers will push the fix to Andrew/Linux, and it 
will go into the next 2.6.x.
Let's keep -stable as good as possible, while still abiding by all the 
other rules.
