That's true, but James Bottomley noticed, that time_init() is called before 
we've done system inventory (which detects if we have a SMP box with multiple CPUs),
so num_online_cpus() would always be one. The update_callback function enables
us to switch back to jiffies if we actually run on a SMP box.
That said, it would be nice to keep the update_callback() functionality or provide another
nice solution around that problem...
