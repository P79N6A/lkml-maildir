I tried that just today. Continued to work despite kupdated hung
in "D" state. After a long while box box froze. SysRq-B worked though.
In my first report to lkml I told that live disconnect of hdc
cured "D" state processes (yes I know I risk burning my southbridge...).
Do you want me to mail it again (there is ksymoopsed SysRq-T)?

Will try this, but I don't specifically seek to eliminate freezes,
I want to help debug new IDE code so that it will be no worse
than 2.4 in this failure mode. I don't want to eliminate DMA failures,
I _want to have them_ to see what IDE code will do.
