The issue is that the IDE driver is taking too long to process a given
request and so the serial driver misses an interrupt and some (serial)  
data is lost.  Other contributing factors are the multiblock fetch count
(if set to high there is more data to transfer per interrupt I think) and
MOST IMPORTANTLY (for me and others) unmasking other interrupts while
procossing a request. All of these are settable using hdparm.
