No, see my earlier reply. "volatile" really *is* an incredible piece of 
crap.
Just try it yourself:
	volatile int i;
	int j;
	int testme(void)
	{
	        return i <= 1;
	}
	int testme2(void)
	{
	        return j <= 1;
	}
and compile with all the optimizations you can.
I get:
	testme:
	        movl    i(%rip), %eax
	        subl    $1, %eax
	        setle   %al
	        movzbl  %al, %eax
	        ret
vs
	testme2:
	        xorl    %eax, %eax
	        cmpl    $1, j(%rip)
	        setle   %al
	        ret
(now, whether that "xorl + setle" is better than "setle + movzbl", I don't 
really know - maybe it is. But that's not thepoint. The point is the 
difference between
                movl    i(%rip), %eax
                subl    $1, %eax
and
                cmpl    $1, j(%rip)
and imagine this being done for *every* single volatile access.
Just do a 
	git grep atomic_read
to see how atomics are actually used. A lot of them are exactly the above 
kind of "compare against a value".
