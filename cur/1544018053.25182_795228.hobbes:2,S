Basic Hints:
1) post lspci -v output to verify device (and bridges) is programmed correctly.
2) look for chipset quirks that disable global msi
3) Make sure MMIO ranges for 0xfee00000 are routed to local APIC
   ie each bridge needs to route that address somehow (negative decode
is common for upstream).
4) manually trigger the MSI by doing a MMIO write to the correct
0xfee00000 address with the assigned vector in order to see if your
interrupt handler gets called.
After that, it's about collecting PCI-X or PCIe traces to verify the
device is generating the transactions correctly and the bridges are
forwarding them.
