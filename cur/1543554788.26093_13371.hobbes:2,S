Let me step aside a second and explain where I'm coming from.  As a spin
off of the work of the linuxBIOS project I have implemented a system
call that implements exec functionality at the kernel level.  Essentially
allowing you to warm boot linux from linux.  To get this to work no
bios calls are involved, so I'm not using setup.S.  This also has the 
interesting side effect of allowing a boot loader to be written that
will work on all linux platforms.  (I have currently just begun my
port to alpha).
In the process of the above I have learned quite a bit about how
the current boot loader works.  And want eventually to convert linux
to not need wrapper code to use my bootloader.
Booting vmlinux is fun :)

After reading through the long mode specs I now agree.  If you could
be in long mode with the mmu disabled that would be a different story
but you can't and it isn't. 
I was thinking of symmetry with the x86 and how much easier everything
is if you only use one processor mode for the initial boot strap.  No
need for super assemblers etc. Oh well.
On x86 there are some real advantages to moving the segment loads into
setup.S from the various head.S's and they still apply (although to a
lesser extent) to x86-64. This causes less code confusion.
For my kexec stuff I now need to think really hard how I want
to handle x86-64.  What I was thinking would work well in general
is to start the processor it's native/optimal mode with the mmu
disabled.  With x86-64 I can't do this unfortunately :(
