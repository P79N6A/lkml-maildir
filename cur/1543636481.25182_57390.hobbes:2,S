Has anyone managed to back-port this patch to 2.4.18 or 2.4.19?
I've run into an inconsistency that I can't figure out.  The variable
"vfsmnt" turns up undefined.  Normally I'd think that would be due to
it being added in the new base code.  But in this case the patch is
deleting it.  OK, so that could be because the older code has another
reference to it that the newer code doesn't have, so the patch didn't
account for that.  But in this case, there's more to it than that.
In this part of the patch:

| +	struct dentry *root;
| +	struct vfsmount *mnt;
The above deletes the definition of "vfsmnt".  Then 3 lines down from
here, there is code used for context which has "vfsmnt" in used.  So
if this patch applies, it would be causing "vfsmnt" to be undefined
and also expecting it to be used.  If all uses of "vfsmnt" are moved
to another file, I would think the line below, which references the
address of it in the call to proc_root_link() would also be moved.
Anyone know what's going on with this?
