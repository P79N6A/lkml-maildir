Subject: [CFT] inflate.c rework arch testing needed

I've reworked the mess that is lib/inflate.c, including:
- proper formatting
- killing a ton of legacy code
- cleaning up IO and CRC handling
- eliminating all the global variables
- using __init for the core kernel
- proper linking rather than the #include "../lib/inflate.c" hack
- lots of minor cleanups along the way
This drops a ton of support code from all the users of this code as
well:

I've converted only some of the users, and currently only tested x86.
Additional x86 testing as well as testing my current ARM and x86_64
support and doing the fixups for the other arches would be
appreciated.
Current patch rollup against 2.6.5-rc1 is at:
