Although I kind of like this "feature," if your OS is wigging out, there
are no guarantees that you're actually writing data to the swap partition.
Especially if it's a driver problem, you might end up writing junk to
your root partition, blowing away your parition table, or worse.
I do think something like this would be nice to have as an _option_ for
the adventurous.  I certainly find it useful from time to time on my
NetBSD boxes.
