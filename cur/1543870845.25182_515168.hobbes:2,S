Is the updatedb problem really due to pagecache?

ray@phoenix:~/work/home/pagecache-management$ grep ext3_i
/proc/slabinfo; ./pagecache-management.sh sudo updatedb; grep ext3_i
/proc/slabinfo
ext3_inode_cache   21024  23722   1584    2    1 : tunables   24   12
  0 : slabdata  11861  11861      0

ray@phoenix:~/work/home/pagecache-management$ echo $(( 1584 * (41332-21024) ))

Or is there a /proc/sys/vm/* knob that can be tweaked for this
before/after the updatedb?
But yeah, I for one would happily submit patches to upstream authors
to address this there. There's no reason code should be making the
kernel guess its intention on these things.
