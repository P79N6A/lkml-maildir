If CSA can use an ELSA module, then we must modify the kernel-tree
for ELSA's fork-connecter. This means it's hard to implement the fork/exec/exit
event notification to userspace (,or any kernel module) without kernel-support.
How CSA shoule be implemented is interesting and important, but should it be
main subject in this discussion that such a kinds of kernel hook is necessary
to implement process-accounting per process-aggregation reasonable ?
In my understanding, what Andrew Morton said is "If target functionality can
implement in user space only, then we should not modify the kernel-tree".
But, any kind of kernel support was required to handle process lifecycle events
for the accounting per process-aggregation and so on, from our discussion.
I'm also opposed to an adhoc approach, like CSA depending on ELSA.
We should walk hight road.
