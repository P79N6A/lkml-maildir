*pong*
I think it is ok to put it into the merge window.

True. I remove this chunk off the patch.

Well, It is related to capacities of newer IPs that allow readproof and 
writeproof features that I enable here :
+	if (cpu_is_at91sam9260() || cpu_is_at91sam9263())
+		mr |= AT91_MCI_RDPROOF | AT91_MCI_WRPROOF;
This allows to have a smooth data transmission internally (prevent 
underruns) and so have full 4 wires capacity. So I think this is good 
for having a full featured driver on all chips.
I resend a corrected patch now.
