Hi!
> Could you tell us how big the FIFO buffers on the modem are? 
Unknown. I think something like 0x400 of buffers is out there.
> What poll frequency do you need and how much time you can miss?
It is modem, so you get about 16KB of data per second. Polling should
probably done so that data are read in 0x100 byte chunks.
How much time can I miss? I don't know. That depends on what v34 can
handle.

PS: Going rtlinux is not acceptable. We want modems to work for normal
users.
