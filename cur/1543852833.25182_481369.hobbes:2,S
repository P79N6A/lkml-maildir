I've been thinking about this too for a while now. There is something
like half of the email volume which are (semi-)automated emails
containing patches moving from a GIT tree to another. I think that
moving this to some linux-dev or something like this would :
  1) reduce the noise on LKML so that problem reports are better caught
  2) reduce the global email volume because instead of sending all these
     emails to 10-20000 persons(?), only maybe a thousand will be subscribed.
  3) reduce even more the latency between post and publication due to 2.
I don't know if others would be interested, in which case it would be wise
to poll on the subject and include Matti and Davem to the discussion.
Regards,
Willy
