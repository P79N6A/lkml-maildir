Well, looking at the patch you see fragments like
-               if (c >= 'A' && c <= 'Z') c += 32;
+               if (small_letter) c = tolower(c);
and
+       opts->small_letter = 0;
and
+               else if (!strcmp(this_char,"small"))
+                       opts->small_letter = 1;
so I suppose that if you try the "small" mount option
you should get the old behaviour back.
[Clearly not a bug, although I don't know whether it is
a good idea to change the case of filenames halfway a
sequence of stable kernels.]
