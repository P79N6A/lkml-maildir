Well, you substituted the module pointer for an atomic counter.  Bit
of a wash, really.

Except that rmmod fails rather frequently on busy modules.  Which
might be ok.

No, if you drop them newer binutils notices the link problem, hence
the __devexit_p(x) macro.

I need that too: the mythical "KBUILD_MODNAME".  Both Keith and Kai
promised it to me...
