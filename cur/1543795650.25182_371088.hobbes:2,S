I forgot to mention that I tried that too.  But thank you for sending
this, because, just to make sure, I tried it again, and now it booted.
I think I might have had a typo when adding idle=poll the first time.  I
think of this as a temporary solution, and I won't be adding that to
grub anytime soon.  Manually typing it in at boot time will keep me
remembering that it is there.  As long as I make sure that I type it
right ;-)
OK, this means that I don't want to stay in the -RT kernel too long
(electric prices are up you know).
