the async threads are as if the user created user-space threads - and 
it's accounted (and scheduled) accordingly.

basically arbitrary notification interfaces are supported. For example 
if you add a sys_kill() call as the last syslet atom then this will 
notify any waiter in sigwait().
or if you want to select(), just do it in the fds that you are 
interested in, and the write that the syslet does triggers select() 
completion.
but the fastest one will be by using syslets: to just check the 
notification ring pointer in user-space, and then call into 
sys_async_wait() if the ring is empty.
I just noticed a small bug here: sys_async_wait() should also take the 
ring index userspace checked as a second parameter, and fix up the 
number of events it waits for with the delta between the ring index the 
kernel maintains and the ring index user-space has. The patch below 
fixes this bug.

these should probably be taken out of the 'async syscall table', along 
with fork and the async syscalls themselves.

i've tested sys_exec() and it seems to work, but i might have missed 
some corner-cases. (And what you raise is not academic, it might even 
make sense to do it, in the vfork() way.)

yeah. Also, create_module() perhaps. I'm starting to lean towards an 
async_syscall_table[]. At which point we could reduce the max syslet 
parameter count to 4, and do those few 5 and 6 parameter syscalls (of 
which only splice() and futex() truly matter i suspect) via wrappers. 
This would fit a syslet atom into 32 bytes on x86. Hm?

agreed, that should be forbidden too.
