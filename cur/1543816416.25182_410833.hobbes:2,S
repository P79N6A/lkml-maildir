In 2.4 I solved this problem at some point by just returning
the excess pages to the buddy allocator. There was even
a nice function to do this (alloc_exact)
That won't work for slab, but does for __get_free_pages() which
is better for large allocations anyways. slab imho doesn't make
sense for allocation anywhere bigger PAGE_SIZE/2. At some
point in 2.6 there was trouble with "compound pages" but I think
that has been resolved. 
Just implementing alloc_exact again would be the simplest solution
for your problem.
