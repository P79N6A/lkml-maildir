As Alexey pointed out to me I have a bug in my tcp_get_info deadlock fix.
I think this incremental patch will cure such problem that I missed. This
because by running synq_init after reading the top of the queue we are
making the whole list local to us and then we can do everything we want
with it without risk to race with tcp_get_info.
