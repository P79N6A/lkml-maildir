I really liked the proposal that Matthew Wilcox came up with:
Todays hirachi:
include/linux		=>	Kernel wide internal
include/sub-system	=>	sub-system internal
include/asm-$(ARCH)	=>	arch specific
include/asm		=>	symlink to include/asm-$(ARCH)
include/asm-generic	=>	default arch implementations
Additional hirachy:
usr/include/linux-abi	=>	kernel wide ABI
usr/include/abi-$(ARCH)	=>	arch specifics ABI
usr/include/arch-abi	=>	symlink to above
I've lost the original email, so the names differ, but the
principle is the same.
Then we could slowly migrate the user level stuff to usr/include.
Do you see this as a sensible solution also for ipv6?
