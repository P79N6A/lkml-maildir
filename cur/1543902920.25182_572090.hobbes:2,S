s390 has per-process accounting that is aware of virtual cpu time, implemented in
arch/s390/kernel/time.c: account_ticks() and arch/s390/kernel/vtime.c:
account_*_vtime(). Timestamps are taken in entry.S for system calls, interrupts
and other system entries and are accounted later, we don't call update_process_times().
