given that the ALSA drivers are not going to be removed, isn't it bloat to 
have two drivers for the same card?
yes, an individual compiled kernel may be slightly smaller by continueing 
to support the OSS driver, but the source (and the maintinance) are 
significantly worse by haveing two drivers instead of just one.
