arm allmodconfig:
fs/ext4/mballoc.c: In function `ext4_mb_generate_buddy':
fs/ext4/mballoc.c:836: error: implicit declaration of function `ext2_find_next_bit'
This patch makes my head spin.
Why did we declare generic_find_next_le_bit() in
include/asm-powerpc/bitops.h (wrong) as well as in
include/asm-generic/bitops/le.h (presumably correct)?
Why is it touching a powerpc file and no any other architectures? 
Something screwed up in powerpc land?
And why did arm break?
Shudder.  Anyway, please fix, and if that fix requires that various
braindamaged be repaired, please repair the braindamage rather than going
along with it.
Thanks.
