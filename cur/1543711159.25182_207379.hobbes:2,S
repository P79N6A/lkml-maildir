This means copying quite some memory.
On the bright side, this would allow to have a well-defined error case
which guarantees the affinity mask is not changed if it cannot be done
completely.  Still, it might mean for some systems (and the number is
going to grow in future) to spend a lot of effort on the error case
which never really is hit.  And the affinity calls have to take a lock,
serializing code possibly quite a bit.
