Hi all,
The CELF Embedded Linux Conference is less than a month away!
The conference is coming up on April 17, 18, and 19 in San Jose, California.
If you haven't already done so, PLEASE visit the conference website -
http://www.celinux.org/elc2007/
 - to check out the session list and
register for this very special event.
There will be lots of great presentations and fascinating demos,
casual Birds-of-a-Feather sessions, and lots of opportunity to
talk to each other.
You'll see talks by prominent figures like Thomas Gleixner,
and Jonathan Corbet will be there to give both a keynote
and a technical session. The complete list of sessions is at
http://www.celinux.org/elc2007/sessions.html
 .
You'll be able to talk directly to many of the primary maintainers
of important kernel features and add-on systems such as uClinux,
power management, etc.
And most importantly, you'll be able to learn and share your
experiences with a lot of real-world industry developers.
If you're planning on coming, now is the time to make the
arrangements. Please register soon so we have an accurate
count of attendees!
We look forward to seeing you there!
/Shawn Kwon, marketing group co-chair of CE Linux Forum
