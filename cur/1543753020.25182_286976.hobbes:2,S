Right. Though I think the "will be back soon" and "is invisible" are
pretty much the same thing. That is, in both our cases (BIST and pmac
PM), we want the device to still be visible to userland, as it actually
exist, should be properly detected by userland config tools etc..., but
may only be actually enabled when the interface is opened/used for PM
reasons.
