Maybe my problem is unrelated to this, but when I try to mount an ext2
image (from an ext3 filesystem, if that counts), loop0 starts to eat
CPU, and brings up the load to around 2.90. After a short time (about
a minute after mounting the image), everything that tries to access
the mounted area hangs. I can't umount it, and can't kill the
processes which are trying to access it.
I have this problem since 2.4.16, 2.4.14 (with ext3 0.9.15) works
fine.
