Now I have to ask - do we discuss udev-0.2 (what I currently have) or 
udev-as-it-can-be-in-fututure?
In udev-0.2 I cannot do it. I can say I want
TOPOLOGY, BUS="scsi", place="0.0.0.0", NAME="jaz"
but the next time I plug in SCSI card the host number changes. Even after I 
unplug USB stick and plug it again it gets new host number.
And the same applies to USB, PCI and whatever. Sysfs exports entity numbers as 
kernel enumerates them; while Solaris exports persistent device tree leaving 
enumeration to user-level tools. Which means that if hardware changes for 
whatever reason enumeration changes as well and your config becomes invalid.

Well, we did not move a tiny bit since the beginning of this thread :) You 
still did not show me namedev configuration that implements persistent name 
for a device based on its physical location :)))
