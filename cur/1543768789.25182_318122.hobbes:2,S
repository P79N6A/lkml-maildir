Probably something like that.. Windows does default to disabling write 
caching on removable drives, to prevent data loss if a device is removed 
without being stopped first, but I think it's quite a bit less 
aggressive about updating the FAT than the original poster's description 
suggests Linux is doing with the sync option (i.e. only updating after 
each user-level write call or something).
