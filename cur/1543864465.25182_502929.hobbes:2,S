No, not at all.  Your situation is you object to the current way the USB
subsystem binds devices to drivers (well, interfaces), and wish to rip
the firmware out of a usb-serial driver that is working just fine right
now.
I still don't understand why you wish to take the firmware out and move
it to userspace, why do you want to do this?
Rainer's problem is a real bug in the USB driver code, which we need to
work on getting fixed, vastly different from your objections.
thanks,
