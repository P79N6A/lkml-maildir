PII 400 + Mainboard Asus P2B BX Chipset, with a IBM Deskstar 16GB UDMA as
/dev/hdc
tu tune the disk I enabled all useful features:
multicount , DMA , unmask IRQs , enable 32 bit support
 /sbin/hdparm -m 8 -d 1 -u 1 -c /dev/hdc
note that windoze is able to get the 20ms latency with my machine , using a
software synthesizer, and copying a file in the background, 
Maybe they use some hacks like IRQ programming, but I think with clever
scheduling , you can reach similar results using RT processes.
try my benchmark yourself:
http://www.gardena.net/benno/linux/latencytest0.3.tgz
to note that heavy access to the /proc filesystem (using top -d 0.01 ) causes
audio drop outs too, not so long as disk access, in the range of 15ms , but that
seems a bit high for me.
we really need an *UGLY* (but useful) hack which allows the write() to
soundcards, to skip some locks of the I/O layer, since audio writes are
completely unrelated to disk I/O , but I have no idea how hard it would be to
implement such a mechanism.
let me know if there are new advances in this area !

Benno.
