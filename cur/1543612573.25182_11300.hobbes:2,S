I met case when dmabuf->count==0 when __start_dac() is called. As result
I still got system freezing even if PCM_ENABLE_INPUT or 
PCM_ENABLE_OUTPUT were set accordingly (I used different patch, see 
another patch I sent today).
My latest revision of patch "survives" without problems already some 
hours (normally I'm not listening radio through internet all time, but 
this time I do ...)
