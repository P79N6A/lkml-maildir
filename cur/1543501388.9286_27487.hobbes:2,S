	Why? user-immutable can be removed by user and by root. If the
system-immutable is set the user-immutable simply doesn't affect anything
(except that if you will remove system-immutable user-immutable will be
still there; you can remove it as you can remove sticky, group-writable,
whatever). What is dangerous with that?
