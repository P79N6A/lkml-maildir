Well, a small iritation is that it adds work for the read and 
write byte function, as a function call adds instructions to
the path. Also, do you want to check that it dosen't break
any existing drivers?
Secondly, you'll probably have a better piece of code for the
E3 driver if you did the block calls with only one setup for
the r/w enable lines per block, instead of checking them for
every byte done. You may even want to use readsb/writesb or
DMA to accelerate the operation.
