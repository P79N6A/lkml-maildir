   The most reliable thing we can do with the current PCI code is to enable
both BIOS and direct access -- if the BIOS at least correctly reports basic
setup information, we use it just for detecting which hardware access
method should we use, avoiding misdetection of that method. This is what
we have by default in recent 2.1 kernels.
				Have a nice fortnight
