the thing is this: The goal of kerneloops.org is to allow developers to focus their effort on the real
important cases. Part of that is knowing which cases to dismiss/not spend time on because of their
relation with one or more binary drivers.... so imo keeping track of this and showing the "don't bother"
flag with it is very much worthwhile; it allows us developers to know what to ignore.
