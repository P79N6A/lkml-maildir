Sorry dude, but there's just no way that any automated process can catch
these.
You will have to provide a detailed bug report (with numbers) like
everyone else so we can fix it.  "Waiting for it to fix itself" is the
WORST thing you can do.
If you find a regression vs. an earlier kernel, please assume that
you're the ONLY one to notice it and respond accordingly.
