Hello list,
    I'm experiencing this problem, using a QuickCam Zoom from you know 
who ... with the pwc driver :
    May 11 21:28:22 kisskool pwc Frame buffer underflow (4 bytes); 
discarded.
    May 11 21:28:22 kisskool pwc Closing video device: 75 frames 
received, dumped 0 frames, 71 frames with errors.
    Now, after contacting NemoSoft about this issue, it seems the 
problem might have to do with the OHCI driver.
   
    Here is my setup :
    Kernel 2.6.6 (but I also had this problem running kernels 2.6.4 & 
2.6.5, never tried with any other, also to mention that it is patched 
for use with a bootsplash).
    USB controller : Nforce2
    Mobo : A7N8X with AMD3200+
Thank you in advance for any help you might give me.
Julien
