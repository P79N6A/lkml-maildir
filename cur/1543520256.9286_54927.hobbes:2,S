This is my first kernel module project, developed on 2.2.5.  I'm keen to
get feedback from folks who have more experience with device drivers and
such.  Please let me know if I've made any horrible design mistakes.  It's
been fun learning about race conditions; the TODO lists the only one I
know about, along with my intended fix.  I'm subscribed to linux-fbdev,
but not to linux-kernel.  Cheers,
- Ben.

description:
DinX is an experimental windowing system that performs clipping and
drawing inside Linux kernel modules.  This eliminates much context
switching between clients and the server, and makes the code small, simple
and fast.  It is aimed at small systems like Linux handhelds.
The first public release includes draggable windows and a simple image
viewer.  All clipping and drawing operations are working properly.  The
window server program is under development, to provide a more complete set
of events.
