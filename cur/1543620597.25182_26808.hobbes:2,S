From what you have written, I can draw the assumption that you think
forwarded packets go through INPUT or OUTPUT?  Then you're thinking in
2.2.x ipchains terms.
In 2.4.x (== iptables) firewalling, forwarded packets go only through 
output.

Maybe something else in your setup was different?  There is no difference
between the filter table in 2.4.13 and 2.4.17.
