I can't speak for the exact const-ification that Jeff did in this
particular patch, but if you intended your comment up there to be a
blanket statement, then you're totally and horribly wrong. There's a
whole plethora of optimizations that gcc does when dealing with const-
marked data. If you've seen / experienced otherwise, please post some
testcases.
