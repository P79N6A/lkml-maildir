Hi,
I am using the eepro100 drivers for my network-card
and it makes my ethernet connection halting when I am
downloading big file, > ~1.5.
When the connection is halted I'll get this message
every second untill it works again:
eepro100: wait_for_cmd_done timeout!
I have noticed that I only have this problem when my X is
running. When my X is shutdown I dont have any problems.
I downloaded and tested the latest stable kernel 2.4.10, but
it still dont work.
I havn't found any solution for this problem, does anyone
known what the problem is ?
