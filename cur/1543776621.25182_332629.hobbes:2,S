[dtor@core ~]$ ls -1d /sys/class/ieee1394*
/sys/class/ieee1394
/sys/class/ieee1394_host
/sys/class/ieee1394_node
/sys/class/ieee1394_protocol
This one is worst. But USB, SCSI, I2C all could use subclasses too.

As far as input subsystem goes we do need nested classes if we were to
keep compatibility with hotplug/udev installations. Please take a look
at the patch below. It complements my version of nested classes patch
(I am attaching it too since I think Matt's version is too complex).
Basically top class will define subsystem while nested classes will
define individual components of subsystem. This will allow keeping old
input hotplug handlers for both input devices and interface devices.
I want the tree look somethng like this:
/sys/class/input/input_dev/input_dev0
                |          input_dev1
                |          input_dev2
		|
                /input_intf/mouse0
                            mice
                            js1
                            js2 
Or we can go even deeper makeing input_intf a subtree with a subclass
for every interface type (evdev, mousedev, etc). But I think that would
be overkill.

We need both I think.

Driver core: make parent class define subsystem for its children
When there is a hierarchy of classes make parent class define
subsystem as reported in hotplug notifications. The full class
path is reported in a new CLASS environment variable.
