I just did some measurements of how often (under real life scenarios like
downloading big files, websurfing, chat and ssh sessions) those pathes are
used.
While in the read_mem32 the unlikekly really seems to be of no use at all (the
switch-case ahead seems to be hit nearly always), the unlikely in the 
write_mem32 seems to be fine.
I compared after each 30 seconds and got median ratio of 1381:1 (for the
likely path) after about 20 minutes, i see a range between 1046:1 and
3511:1. So i wouldn't call it a bad guess from my beginners point of view.
Thanks,
Frank
