Consider egg yolk and egg shells.
I produce egg yolk.  I give it to you under terms that say "if you
pass this on, you must do so in such a way that doesn't stop anyone
from eating it"
You produce egg shells.  You carefully construct your shell around the
egg yolk and some white you got from a liberal third party.
Then you sell the egg shells, with white and yolk inside, under
contracts that specify "the shell must be kept intact, it can't be
broken or otherwise perforated".
Are you or are you not disrespecting the terms that apply to the yolk?

Yes.  This means the hardware distributor who put the software in
there must not place roadblocks that impede the user to get where she
wants with the software, not that the vendor must offer the user a
sport car to take her there.
The goal is not to burden the vendor.  The goal is to stop the vendor
from artificially burdening the user.
