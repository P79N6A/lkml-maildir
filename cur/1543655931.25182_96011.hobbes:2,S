I agree.  It doesn't feel right.  I mean, doing a mkdir(1) to create a
device, which causes files to be created automagically in that
directory?  Something needs to change here, and I proposed a single file
to write to that creates the device, but was shot down by the author.
Anyone else have any ideas?

Heh, yeah, welcome to parsers in the kernel :)
But the dm code today does much the same thing with ioctls, passing a
string down to the loaded modules below it.  So there is a bit of
president.  Even if it is ugly :)

Nice catch.  I'm not sure that the find_page(), __io() and friends
functions are really needed at all.
Thanks for looking at this.  I hope the dm authors can help explain
more.
