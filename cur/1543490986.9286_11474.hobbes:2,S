What DMA problem is this? The only DMA problem im aware if is "trickle DMA
on PCI sound cards and PCI video cards hogging the bus" problem. Eg the
old Matrox PCI video killing sound bug.
FWIW I havent had any problems with CS4237B DMA driven ISA sound cards on
VP3 chipsets, while driving UDMA drives full throttle.
I do have one problem (hard lockup) with driving UDMA full throttle while
banging on a 40x IDE cdrom but at this point its unclear whether its the
drive at fault or the VP3 chipset. Andre has promised to look into it
further.
