It seems to already do that for me.
What I do have, is some bizzaaro hardware that gives some weird escape
keycode for alt-sysreq, so alt-sysreq s,u,b doesn't work. Could be the
fact that it is a PS2 keyboard plugged into an old AT style connector,
or something else, but I don't know where to start looking to fix
it. It's a relatively recent and relatively clean debian install, and
I don't know what I did wrong - I noticed this behaviour pretty much
from the start.
Maybe I'm asking for not just alt to be the prefix, maybe give the
choice of ctrl, etc. But I have a feeling ctrl is kinda funky on the
console of this machine as well.
