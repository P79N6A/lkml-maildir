The big IDE update is going into 2.4.19pre. Thats going to overlap with this
patch I suspect. You might want to cross check with 2.4.19pre3 when it
appears and see how much you can remove.

This define is already in pci_ids.h so shouldnt be needed here. Check the
file includes <linux/pci_ids.h>

We use Mb for a reason (old disks look odd) - maybe using Gb once its >=
2Gb would work to make it look neater ?

elsewhere you switched to PCI_VENDOR_ID_PROMISE ? - trivial question

You've removed the raid ones. The driver has to find those so that
the ataraid driver can then sit on top of them. 
Other than that it looks pretty sound. Your mailer seems to have messed
the tabs up so once 19pre3 appears and you've had a look at it can you
send me a copy as an attachment ?
Thanks
Alan
