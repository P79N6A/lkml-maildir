I've got multiple boxes across the hall that have 50T of disk on them, in one
case as one large filesystem, and the users want *more* *bigger* still (damned
researchers - you put a 15 teraflop supercomputer in the room, and then they
want someplace to *put* all the numbers that come spewing out of there.. ;)
There comes a point where that downtime gets too long to be politically
expedient.  6->2 may not be a biggie, because you can likely get a 6 hour
window.  24->8 suddenly looks a lot different.
(Having said that, I'll admit the one 52T filesystem is an SGI Itanium box
running Suse and using XFS rather than ext3).
Has anybody done a back-of-envelope of what this would do for fsck times for
a "max realistically achievable ext3 filesystem" (i.e. 100T-200T or ext3
design limit, whichever is smaller)?
(And one of the research crew had a not-totally-on-crack proposal to get a
petabyte of spinning oxide.  Figuring out how to back that up would probably
have landed firmly in my lap.  Ouch. ;)
