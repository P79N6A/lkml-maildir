I'd much rather _not_ do it like that.
Remembe: do one thing, and do it well. Mixing up seveal conceptually
unrelated things just ends up a maintenance nightmare, and implies tying
the two together more than necessary.
What if somebody wants shared memory but not UNIX domain sockets? Or
vice versa? Issues like that add extra and unnecessary complexity if you
want to tie the functionality together.
