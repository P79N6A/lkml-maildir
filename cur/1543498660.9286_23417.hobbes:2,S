Common misconception: identifying the root FS isn't the boot loader's
business (1). Passing new, unknown parameters doesn't require changes
in the boot loader.
(1) Possible exception: those boot loaders which actually try to
    understand the file system structure. Fortunately (2), LILO isn't
    one of them.
(2) New functionality like LVM and new file systems will make it a
    rather interesting exercise to keep them up to date ;-)
