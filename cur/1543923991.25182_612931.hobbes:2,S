Really? No, we still do that magic COW thing which creates anonymous
pages in MAP_SHARED vmas, don't we?
But I think that is pretty arbitrary as well. What the "force" argument to
get_user_pages on a MAP_SHARED vma effectively does is punt the permission
check from the vma permissions to the file permissions. If you've opened the
file WR but mmap()ed PROT_READ, it goes ahead and COWs, wheras if you've
opened the file RDONLY it -EFAULTs.
This seems strange wrong, because the act of COWing seems to be exactly
done in order to *absolve* us of file permissions (if we're COWing, why
should it matter if the file happened to be readonly or not).
Could we just try disallow COW for MAP_SHARED mappings?
Seeing as we're doing the break-ptrace thing this release already ;)
All the stuff I know of that requires forced COW (ie. gdb for breakpoints),
does so on MAP_PRIVATE mappings.
I know this is one of Hugh's bugbears. I don't know whether he's thought
out how to remove it, but I wonder if the appended patch is roughly in
the right direction?

We do for MAP_SHARED|MAP_ANONYMOUS, by the looks.
