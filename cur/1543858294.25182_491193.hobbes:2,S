well, there are interrupts that must be tied to a single CPU and must 
never be moved away. For example per-CPU clock-events-source interrupts 
are such. So allowed_affinity very much exists.
also there might be hardware that can only route a given IRQ to a subset 
of CPUs. While setting set_affinity allows the irqbalance-daemon to 
'probe' this mask, it's a far from optimal API.
