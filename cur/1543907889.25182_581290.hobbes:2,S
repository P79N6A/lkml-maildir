Hi all,
I'm trying to track down whats causing the problems with a Silicon Image
3124 PCI/PCI-X sata card and running it under linux.
A quick rundown on the hardware that is in use.
Athlon X2 4200+
Asus A8S-X Mobo
Silicon Image 3124 4port SATA RAID card (using a PCI slot)
5x500gb WDJB 500gb SATA/SATA2
1x200gb WDJB 200gb IDE
Running pure 64bit ubunutu and tested with both a hand compiled kernel
as well as the ones that were supplied (2.6.20, 2.6.22)
The drives themselves are in a 5disk software raid5 array. Now initially
I didnt have any problems but after a bit of use I get errors like
below. It seems to only be when the drives are put under high load and
ive not been able to pinpoint the problem. I've swapped drives around as
well as run complete bad block scans over the drives (as at times it
reports that there are medium errors) to which there are none. I've
updated the firmware/bios on the sata card and the motherboard and also
replaced a number of cables in the system.
The errors I get are like these.

Eventually of course it gives up and kicks the drive out of the array.
This problem has been ongoing. I'm about to give 2.6.23-mm a go and see
if that helps as there were a few libata fixups but they dont appear to
be related specifically to this card however I'm willing to test it out.
Another example of the errors I have been seeing are these.

As you can see it does try and attempt to recover but then just fails
out. I've also tried locking the SATA link to SATA1/SATA150 using
jumpers on the actual hdd's themselves.
I'm at a total loss as to what is causing the problem as the drives do
seem to work ok on their own and the smartctl doesnt seem to return
anything meaningful.
Anyone able to figure out whats happening?
