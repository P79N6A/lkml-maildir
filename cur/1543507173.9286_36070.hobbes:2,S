Hi,
  I've been having similar messages appear with my drive too,
 my dmesg output looks similar.
  I've also been having mysterious crash's which I've assumed
 were due to the SCSI emulation on my CD writer, sometimes I get
 messages about scsi being reset, then shortly afterwards a
 complete lockup.  (I could provide more details next week if
 anybody has any ideas about this..)
  Unfortunately I've just had complete crashes, no OOPS, no
 meaning full errrors ..  The only thing I've had is a 
 few lines of this kind of thing:
... : status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
... : error=0x04 { DriveStatusError }
  I'm using kernel 2.2.11.

   I also get this message, don't know what it means..
