Basically yes. Some of the architecture properties leak into the main tree
but we try and avoid that except when the alternative is really ugly.
The include/asm-* and arch/* code is a mix of things like bootstrap code
and also architecture dependant code 
	arch/*/kernel contains the kernel layer functions that are specific
	- things like ptrace, signal delivery and syscalls as well as
	interrupts and traps.
	arch/*/mm handles architecture specific memory management, most of
	the mm is defined by the includes that describe the page tables

There are books on the subject, no good online documentation.
