The 2.6.17+ development model is different from a traditional 2.7 
development model in the sense that 2.6.17+ contains regular relatively 
stable releases.
But yes, what I suggest is partially a step back in a way that it 
doesn't conflict with the current 2.6.17+ development model.
Well, if taking the best from the old style development is improving 
things that isn't something bad.
