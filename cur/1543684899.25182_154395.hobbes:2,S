We can do this.  We're tracking Linus's tree anyway for the work we're
doing.  
  We'd probably do daily automated builds to check that the kernel
still compiles cleanly for HPSIM, DIG, and ZX1, but test only weekly.
If you have anyu specific configuration options you think should be
included, let us know.

You are lost in a maze of BitKeeper repositories,   all slightly different.
