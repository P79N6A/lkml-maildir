Nothing but SPI (parallel scsi) has a target id.  Everything that broadly
falls under SAM has luns.  Because SPI is dying transport the scsi
midlayer will get rid of having a mandatory target id mid-term.  Relying
on the target id to have any useful meaning is dangerous, it doesn't
have a really useful meaning on anything but SPI.
