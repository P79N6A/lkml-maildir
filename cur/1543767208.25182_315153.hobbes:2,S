*Sigh*
Done from a test machine I have over here on a two node cluster. 
I rebooted and re-formatted between tests.
* Without LKM_LOCAL:
[root@ca-test7 ocfs2]# time tar -zxf /tmp/linux-2.6.11.7.tar.gz 
real    0m39.699s
user    0m3.644s
sys     0m8.076s
* With LKM_LOCAL
[root@ca-test7 ocfs2]# time tar -zxf /tmp/linux-2.6.11.7.tar.gz 
real    0m22.076s
user    0m3.869s
sys     0m7.234s
So yes, I'd say it's worth a significant amount of performance to us :)
