No. Though I'd advise everyone to stick with 33MHz PCI when they can
because it is safe. But even the VIA specs mention 25, 37.5 and 41.5 PCI
speeds.

If you set a MVP3 or MVP4 chipset to 83 MHz FSB, you'll get 41.5 MHz
or 27.6 MHz PCI. And there are chips speced for 75 and 83 MHz FSB's -
Cyrix 6x86MX etc.
No way to get 33 here, if you *don't* want to over/under-clock the CPU.
