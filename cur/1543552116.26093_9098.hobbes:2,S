Note that there _are_ cases where 0-byte reads and writes have specific
meaning, notably there are some networking things where a 0-byte sendto()
does something special if I remember correctly. And I seem to remember
that this also _did_ translate into write().
I remember that Linux used to do exactly this, and we had to pass the
0-byte writes into the low-level cases exactly because some low-level
cases do care. I suspect SUS only talks about regular files.
