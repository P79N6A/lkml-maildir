C99 initializes (.foo) are supported at least down to gcc 2.7

e.g. you have
#if LINUX_VERSION_CODE >= KERNEL_VERSION(2,4,11)
MODULE_LICENSE("GPL");
#endif
much better would be to put a 
#ifndef MODULE_LICENSE
#define MODULE_LICENSE(name)
#endif
into some header and use it unconditionally later on.
or you have
#if LINUX_VERSION_CODE >= KERNEL_VERSION(2,6,0)
    b = virt_ctr ? NUMDATA(scp->device->host)->busnum : scp->device->channel;
    t = scp->device->id;
#else
    b = virt_ctr ? NUMDATA(scp->host)->busnum : scp->channel;
    t = scp->target;
#endif
where the 2.6 branch just works for 2.4 and 2.2 kernels aswell, so you
could get rid of the old branch completely.
In genereal always try to write to the current API and emulate it on
older releases.
