Subject: [PATCH RT] Don't allow non-threaded softirqs and threaded hardirqs

Ingo,
I think this was sent before, and it did cause problems before. Would
there be *any* reason to have non-threaded softirqs but threaded hardirqs.
I can see lots of issues with that.
This patch has selecting hardirqs also select softirqs as threads.
