Looks as expected, nothing too excessive showing up. About 30-40% sys
time, but it should not bog the machine down that much.

I did, thanks :)

Nothing sticks out here either. There's plenty of idle time. It smells
like a driver issue. Can you try the same dd test, but read from the
drives instead? Use a bigger blocksize here, 128 or 256k.
You might want to try the same with direct io, just to eliminate the
costly user copy. I don't expect it to make much of a difference though,
feels like the problem is elsewhere (driver, most likely).
If we still can't get closer to this, it would be interesting to try my
block tracing stuff so we can see what is going on at the queue level.
But lets gather some more info first, since it requires testing -mm.
