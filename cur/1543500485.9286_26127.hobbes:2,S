Hello,
it seems that knfsd does not exports more than one filesystem: If I want
to export / and /usr (two different partitions) to a client, with knfsd,
the client will have to perform two different mount operations.
This might be a bit tedious when nfs-exporting the contents of a big
ftp server, spread over many partitions/disks. Would it be difficult to
patch the kernel so that submounts are transparently exported as well ?
I think this issue was already discussed but I cannot find it. By the
way, is there somewhere a complete archive of the list ? Something
like a big tar file so I could use my favorite search engine: grep.
