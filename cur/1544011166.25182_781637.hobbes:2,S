Ok that makes sense.

It doesn't really obscure it (although there are some doubts it can
express many of the more powerful/complicated features of modern PMUs),
but provides a set of generalized standard events in addition, plus
a "raw mode". The current list of events as of v4 is:
+       PERF_COUNT_CYCLES               =  0,
+       PERF_COUNT_INSTRUCTIONS         =  1,
+       PERF_COUNT_CACHE_REFERENCES     =  2,
+       PERF_COUNT_CACHE_MISSES         =  3,
+       PERF_COUNT_BRANCH_INSTRUCTIONS  =  4,
+       PERF_COUNT_BRANCH_MISSES        =  5,
I think cache_references/misses is not well defined enough to be useful.
The Intel architectural perfmon (which is a standard set of event
supported over a range of Intel x86 micro architectures) has similar
events defined as hitting the LLC (last level cache). With that
it makes some sense.
