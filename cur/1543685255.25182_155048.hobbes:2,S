I sould add some things:
I'm using ReiserFS.
I've made a test-run without X in the console now.
I started this program on tty0, to see if there are big skips or
something like that:
int main()
{
	while (1) {
		printf("jkhdsjklhfkjfhsdjkhjbghghjghjjh");
		printf("jsdlökflsm,dfowekcldfqw");
		printf("JKjhdsjkfhsnsdjkhJhjkhjkbmnxbuihjknlk");
		printf("kcjkld");
	}
	return 0;
}
When the machine isn't doing any disk-access, the "garbage-printing"
to the console, produced by the program above is very smooth.
But when I start dd on another tty, massive skips and breaks occur
to the output of the nice program above.
These are not small skips and breaks.
The system is quite unusable during running dd, because it doesn't
respond as it should.
I just tried to run the test-scenario on my other Linux-installation
on this machine with kernel 2.4.10 and there the output of the program
was quite smooth, even it dd was running und the system was still usable.
