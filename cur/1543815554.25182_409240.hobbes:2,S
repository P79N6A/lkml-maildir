The patch description includes:
5. Make it possible to configure NUMA systems without page migration
   and non-NUMA systems with page migration.
I don't see the point in making this option visible for the majority of 
users on non-NUMA systems who will never need it.
When is it required on non-NUMA systems?
Memory hotplug?
Can we express this explicitely?
