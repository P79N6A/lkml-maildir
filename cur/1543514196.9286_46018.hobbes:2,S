You _can_ do it, but it's generally frowned upon.  There are two other
approaches you can take:
1) devfs - Richard Gooch posts notifications about updates to the list all
the time, check an archive for the URL...
2) create the nodes in a /proc directory, and pre-populate /dev with
symlinks to wherever the nodes will go.  I.e., your driver creates:
	/proc/magicdriver/pipe1 (char device X,Y)
and you, prior to ever installing or loading your module, have already
created:
	/dev/magicpipe1 (symlink) -> /proc/magicdriver/pipe1
That's how I've done it in the past.  It's pretty easy, requires a
dirt-simple setup script to be run one time (instead of after every
install of the module, which I gather is what you want to avoid), and the
code is dirt simple:  (snipped from something I was working back in late
2.1 days)
	struct proc_dir_entry *node = malloc(sizeof(struct proc_dir_entry)); 
	*node = (struct proc_dir_entry) {
		0, strlen("device"), "device", 
		S_IFBLK | S_IWUSR | S_IRUGO |
		  MKDEV(device_major, device_minor),
                1, 0, 0, 0,
                &blkdev_inode_operations,
                NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL,
                NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, 0 };
	proc_register(parent_proc_directory, node);
Good luck,
Adam
