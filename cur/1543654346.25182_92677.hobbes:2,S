You have it back to front.  The real problem is open code that calls
functions in sections that have been discarded, that code is an oops
just waiting to happen.  When binutils was changed to detect such
dangling references, it found a lot of bad code on rarely tested error
paths.  Your method would stop binutils finding the dangling references
and open the kernel up to bad code again.
__devexit_p tells the build "these functions are known to be omitted at
link time, do not reference them at build time".  IOW, we tell the
kernel that these references are safe, allowing binutils to find all
the other references to discarded code - the bad ones.
Removing the check from binutils is not an option.  The problem was
originally detected on ia64 and mips which use program counter relative
calls with a small number of bits for the offset from current PC.  The
dangling references to functions in discarded sections resulted in
calls to address 0 or to small addresses (actually the offset of the
target function from the start of the discarded section).  Trying to
convert that into PC relative format resulted in an offset which would
not fit in the number of available bits and the linker/insmod flagged a
relocation error.
Bottom line - unsafe references to discarded sections must be detected
by ld/insmod.  Kernel developers have to flag safe references to
discarded sections via __devexit_p().
