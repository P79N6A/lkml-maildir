Can you see any correlation between being on AC or on battery and this 
bug occuring? Sometimes the BIOS might even do C states depending on 
whether the box was booted up on AC or on battery. (and sometimes the 
kernel calibrates things differently when booting up on battery [lower 
speed] - so this can have an effect too.)
