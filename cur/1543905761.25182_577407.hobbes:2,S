Sorry, of course I ran that through mcelog, but inadvertently attached 
the original version.
I've tried the machines with two types of power sources (different 
UPSes, line filtering, etc,
and the chassis have redundant PSes), monitoring the temperatures (seems 
to be OK,
the CPUs don't go over 30 °C even under load). I have the latest BIOS 
for the
motherboard.
But I will recheck everything.
BTW, here's the output from mcelog, I see this occasionally on all four 
machines:
HARDWARE ERROR
