I wonder where this convention of using lower numbers to indicate higher 
priorities comes from...  It seems to be quite prevalent even though it's 
obviously backwards.

Okay; I'm not fixated on any particular size.

All right.  However this means thread_struct will have to grow in order to
hold each task's debug-register allocations and priorities.  Would that be
acceptable?  (This might be a good reason to keep the number of bits
down.)
Another question: How can a program using the ptrace API ever give up a
debug-register allocation?  Disabling the register isn't sufficient; a
user program should be able to store a watchpoint address in dr1, enable
it in dr7, disable it in dr7, and then re-enable it in the expectation
that the address stored in dr1 hasn't been overwritten.  As far as I can
see, ptrace-type allocations have to be permanent (until the task exits or
execs, or uses some other to-be-determined API to do the de-allocation.)
