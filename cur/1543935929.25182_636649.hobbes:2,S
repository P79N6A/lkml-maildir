Ok, if I apply both of the patches, I get better results for SLOB:
[ the minimum, maximum, and average are captured from 10 individual runs ]

I'll double check the results for SLUB next but it seems obvious that your 
patches are a net gain for SLOB and should be applied. One problem though 
with SLOB seems to be that its memory efficiency is not so stable. Any 
ideas why that is?
