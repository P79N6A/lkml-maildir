Trent,
The symbol_put is correct in this case.  This macro above is called 
"tuner_symbol_probe" , used only within tuner-core.c
This macro is used to call the probe function of a tuner sub-module 
(tea5761, tea5767, tda8290).  Regardless of whether the probe succeeds 
or fails, we do the symbol_put.  If the probe succeeds, tuner-core will 
proceed to dvb_attach(that_tuner_attach, params), which does the actual 
module use count increase.
