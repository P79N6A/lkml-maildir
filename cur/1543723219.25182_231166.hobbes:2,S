I think your mailer whitespace-munged the patch.  
Also, why do you need this information:
+       seq_printf(m, "partition_active_processors=%d\n",
+                       (int) lparcfg_count_active_processors());
Doesn't that duplicate information already exported in /proc/cpuinfo and
/sys/devices/system/cpu?
