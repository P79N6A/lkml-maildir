Ok, but...  why not?
Have you ever tried, at 4pm some afternoon, sitting in a room with some
paper and implementing the AA user interface on top of selinux?
An initial selinux policy can basically be:
print "type base_t;"
for c in object_class:
	"allow base_t base_t:c *;"
Then, if the AA user has a profile
	/bin/login {
		/etc/shadow r
	}
it creates domain login_t, entry type login_et assigned to /bin/login,
and shadow_t as a type which login_t can only read, but non-restricted
domains (i.e. base_t) can read and write.  It also makes read and write
macros for a bunch of selinux perms (i.e. ioctl, etc), the way the
Tresys CDE tool does.
I do want LSM to survive, and am reserving my judgement of AA until
I see the code, but if it really is just about ease of use, then
perhaps it should be a pure userspace thing?
OTOH perhaps there are reasons why you can't do this, and you can
explain why the above won't work.
