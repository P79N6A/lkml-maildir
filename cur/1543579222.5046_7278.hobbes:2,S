Then you are back to the arguement about should the naming be based on the
function of the device (scsi0,1,2 / eth0,1,2) or based on the hardware
(aic7xxx0,1,2 advansys0,1,2 / tulip0,1,2 eepro0,1,2). *BSD uses this
naming scheme for its ethernet interfaces, not sure about its scsi thou.
I prefer the functional naming scheme (scsi0 / eth0) as I can change the
hardware in a machine and not change anything in the init scripts,
assuming the driver is in kernel or if not I only need to change the line
/etc/modules.conf.
