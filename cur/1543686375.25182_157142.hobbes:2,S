movntq for a memcpy? That ise a very bad idea. It wins in micro benchmarks,
but the destination is pushed out of cache and the next code accessing
the destination will suffer badly from the cache misses. All the NT
stuff is basically useless in the kernel because it only helps with data
sets significantly bigger than your cache, and we usually only deal
with 4K chunks of everything.
[I did the same mistake early on Opteron/x86-64 for copy_page, but later 
fixed it]

The x86-64 manuals lists it as part of the 3dnow feature set.
The K6 has it, right?
Is there a "more original" 3dnow that what has been in the K6?

It doesn't work like the AMD instruction reference manual describes it.

Being a bit touchy from the heat today ? @)
Of course it should be fixed, but the fix as it is a bug workaround
doesn't have to be very fast. So it would be ok to just clear the 3dnow bit.
But then to handle the K6 case (which is interesting, I didn't know) too it
would be probably better to define a separate bit.

Ok. I will do that when I'm back next week unless someone beats me

Hmm ok. So it probably needs an alternative3().
It's not hard to do, just a bit ugly because the macro will have a lot of
arguments.

I didn't know about the misalignment bit. Interesting. Misalignment to
what boundary?
But is it slower than an aligned execution? If yes I would prefer my 
solution because it keeps the fast path as fast as possible.
