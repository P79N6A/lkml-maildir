As mentioned earlier on this list, we saw similar corruption,
detectable by the fact that if you do a ls -R on the file system
there will be input/output errors due to inodes that are no longer
there, eventually.
We began with a system with a Seagate system drive (master, ide0), same
model as in Marvin's post..   IDE cd rom
as slave on the ide0 bus, and two IBM data drives on the ide1 bus.
The vendor eventually swapped out all the Seagate drives for
Western Digital ones, which does not make the problem go away,
but makes it much less frequent and harder to reproduce, but
at least there is something in /var/log/messages to show for it
whenever it does happen.  It is wrong to think this problem happens
only with Seagate drives.
