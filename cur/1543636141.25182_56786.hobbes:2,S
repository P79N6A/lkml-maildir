Just a hint: the block layer is for caching blocks from disk type deveices.
-	Block device access is always going directly into the block cache.
	So the I/O is always kernel I/O. In addition, it is async I/O - the 
	block layer fires it up and may wait for it later after sending out other
	requests.
-	Character device access is synchronous access and may be either kernel
	or user space DMA access. In most cases, it is user space DMA access.
How try to ask your question again...

How is it implemented?
