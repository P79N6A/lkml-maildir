That's interesting. Are you running a fairly recent pthread lib?

Did you run that with SCHED_FIFO or SCHED_OTHER? If it was with
SCHED_FIFO, it was a pretty good result. But maybe your machine is
just very fast. What CPU is that? DId you use 2.6.14-rt2 or some other
version?

Yes, they are supposed to act differently. In particular, my
understanding of realtime scheduling suggests SCHED_FIFO is supposed
to provide better (meaning lower) wakeup latency.
Thanks for tryting this out. Although I'm still puzzled at the low
number of threads you were able to create.
