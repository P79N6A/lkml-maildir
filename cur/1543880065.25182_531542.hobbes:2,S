yeah, the primary intent was debug. Nick, am i confused to conclude that 
mainline in fact runs the _parent_ first, despite all the elaborate 
runqueue juggling we do there? This piece of code in wake_up_new_task() 
caught my eyes:
                                p->prio = current->prio;
                                p->normal_prio = current->normal_prio;
                                list_add_tail(&p->run_list, &current->run_list);
                                p->array = current->array;
                                p->array->nr_active++;
                                inc_nr_running(p, rq);
shouldnt the list_add_tail() be list_add(), so that task pickup sees the 
child first? Maybe we still do child-runs-first in practice, due to the 
timeslice and sleep average fixups that happen if the parent preempts, 
but the above piece of code seems a quite elaborate way of doing 
activate_task(). To have the child _before_ the parent we'd need the 
add-on patch below. But ... i could be wrong, this is just a quick 
thought.
