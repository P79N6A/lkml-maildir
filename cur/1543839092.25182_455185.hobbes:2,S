defines make some sense for userspace-visible ABIs because then people
can test for features with ifdef.  It doesn't make any sense for constants
that are used purely in-kernel.  For those enums make more sense because
you can for example looks at the symbolic names with a debugger.

I noticed that you do it, but it's not exactly considered a nice design.

Yes, it requires a separate syscall.

Do you have a reference to it?  In this case a char devices makes a lot of
sense because you get a filedescriptor and have operations only defined on
it.  In fact given that you have a multiplexer anyway there's really no
point in adding a syscall for that aswell, you could rather use the existing
and debugged ioctl() multiplexer.  Sure, it's still not what we consider
nice, but better than adding even more odd multiplexer syscalls.
