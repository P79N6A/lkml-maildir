I am currently using kernel 2.4.21-rc1.
Problem I am having is that my swap is used only after all of my 
physical ram is used. My system then starts to run a lot slower. 
Especially processes that allocate lots of memory. If the kernel knows 
that memory is inactive, why doesn't it swap it to disk so that memory 
doesn't have to be shuffled around when a new process needs memory? It 
would also make me happy to be able to swap dirty memory to disk.
Thanks,
David
