I've pretty much not had any job context and/or time to move this into
2.6. It seems that Andrew's work is getting lots of good review and
is improving and has the full support of the h/w vendor.
I'm actively maintaining this driver, but the context is more in
relation to target mode support for Quantum these days, which is lucky
if it's newer than a 2.4.20 kernel (and 2.2.6 or some darned thing for
PowerPC).
Unless there's a great demand for it, it's not clear whether this
driver will make it into 2.6. I'd really have to get a job context and a
refresh of some of the newer h/w to be able to do this.
But thanks for noting it- it's been a fun project over the years.
