ACPI design seems to have aditional benefit: if your fan fails, you
can still operate machine safely. You just have to be clever with
throttling etc :-). [Assuming vendor did set shutdown threshold
right. HP Omnibook XE3 will kill power at 83C. If you leave it running
at ~82C for ten hours, you'll fry the disk. Oops.]
Funniest machine in this regard was 300MHz P2 toshiba. On extreme
overheat (95C), it went to 40MHz no matter what os did. At that point
it was able to cool itself even without fan. [But I was pretty puzzled
when I saw that behaviour].

Well, its enough to end the test when CPU starts doing errors. Usually
CPU stops working at some temperature, and is only physically damaged
after that. Or you can get datasheets from CPU manufacturer, and call
the machine's design broken when it exceeds CPU design limits by
5C... This should be testable without letting magic smoke out.
