Please don't do this to me.
 - give a valid URL! 
   You could have either added a "ssh://" to before that string, or used a 
   colon between the hostname and the path, but the URL you quoted is 
   broken.
 - put the branch-name after the URL on the same line, so that I can 
   cut-and-paste them together rather than separately (and so that I don't 
   miss the fact that it wasn't the default branch)
IOW, it should have said
  Please pull from the 'for_linus' branch at
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/galak/powerpc.git for_linus
or something similar.
Thanks from your anal and grumpy kernel maintainer,
		Linus
