Pet peeve?  There are about five "reliable UDPs" floating
around.  Take a look at
	
http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2960.html
SCTP is mainly designed as a way of transporting telephony signalling
information across IP.  But it is now a quite general purpose protocol.
Culturally, this is "Telephony industry comes to IP.  Telephony
industry is appalled.  IP industry gets a clue".
SCTP provides the reliable delivery of messages to which you refer.
It's slightly more efficient than TCP for a given set of network
characteristics - there's no statement about implementation
efficiency here. No head-of-line blocking issues.
One very interesting part of SCTP is that transport endpoints are
explicitly set up between *hosts*, not between IP addresses.  The
protocol is designed around multihomed hosts.
I don't know if anyone has looked into mapping SCTP capabilities onto
the BSD socket API.  It may be hard.
The reference implementation is for userland Linux.  It's at
ftp://standards.nortelnetworks.com/sigtran/
A good kernel-mode implementation of SCTP for Linux would be
a very big project.  But also a very big contribution.
