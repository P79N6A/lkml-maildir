I guess that one of the tradeoffs to be considered for having a fixed
boottime.  If after boot time NTP corrects the system time, then the
boot time would not change in accordance with NTP's correction.

When you mention that quirk above, wouldn't that mean then that the
boottime would be off by the amount of time the system is suspended?
If uptime or jiffies is not updated but 'now' (the system time) is,
then btime would be pushed forward...

Yes, that would be interesting to know.
Personally, I have been using it to determine when processes started.
Starttime, and some other process data that is recorded and presented
in /proc in jiffies.  So to determine when a process started I took
that value, converted to seconds, and added it to btime.  I was a bit
surpised to find that btime changed, however.  And the way it is now
it'll still change whenever the system time is changed.  However, at
least with the fix from 2.5.70, it doesn't wobble anymore due to loss
of precision.
