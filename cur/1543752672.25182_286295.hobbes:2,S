For the N'th time, it gives vendors a chance to have packages
ready at the time of disclosure.

Not having to panic and rush out releases on day of disclosure.
Not having users vulnerable whilst packages build/get QA/get pushed to mirrors.
Users of kernel.org kernels get to build and boot in under an hour.
Vendor kernels take a lot longer to build.
1- More architectures.
   (And trust me, there's nothing I'd like more than to be able
	to increase the speed of kernel builds on some of the architectures
	we support).
2- More generic, ie more modules to build.
In the case of public disclosure of issues that we weren't aware of,
it's a miracle that we get update kernels out on day of disclosure
in some cases. (In others, we don't, and the same applies to other vendors too)
