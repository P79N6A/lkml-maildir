Hi Andrea,
Do you have plans to generalize seccomp into somelike like a "syscall
firewall"? This _would_ be useful to many apps, and provide good security
benefits - for example, vsftpd does not need most of the previously-buggy
syscalls such as sysctl(), mremap() and execve(). But it does need more
than just read(), write() and exit()!
Cheers
Chris
