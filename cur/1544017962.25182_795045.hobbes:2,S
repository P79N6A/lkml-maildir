Currently when modversions is enabled the kernel will not load any
modules that depend on exported symbols with names longer than
64 - sizeof(unsigned long) characters.
This is because the struct modversion_info has the name member set to a
size of MODULE_NAME_LEN.  This is not the module name this is the symbol
name so I'm guessing this is a mistake or at least a misused constant.
Is it possible to increase this size to something more reasonable like
512 characters?
