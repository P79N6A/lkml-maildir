Hi Wolfgang (and all),
Thanks for the input.  However, I am not understanding
exactly why kernel mode is treated any differently than
user mode for this sort of thing.  I am looking at the code
in ehci-q.c and ehci-hcd.c.
It seems like the unlinking of completed URBs
happens asynchronously on a timer.  This is a
surprise to me since I thought this was happening
on an IRQ from the host controller.  But if what I'm
surmising is correct it would explain everything
I am seeing.  I'm not able to ascertain how
user mode drivers are treated differently than
kernel mode drivers in this regard.  From what I
can tell, all drivers would be broken equally!
Can anyone who has more experience
with this code confirm this for me?
Besides, we count on sub-10 ms response times all the
time in user mode.  Take for example, the access of a file.
If opening a file had a fixed latency of 4 ms, people
would be up in arms.  So that's not entirely a valid excuse.
A USB operation that used to take 1 ms now takes 4 ms.
That's a pretty big change.
The ability to write user-mode drivers for USB devices
is very powerful for deployment.  If one writes a kernel
driver, there are severe deployment hassles.  As such,
my company has chosen to write user-mode drivers
on both Windows to avoid driver deployment nightmares.
This has been extremely successful so far..  Ironically,
Windows (using libusb-win32) has had no such performance
glitches. As a matter of principle, Linux should at least be
as good as Windows, right?
Hopefully we can get this sorted out.
Cheers.

Relying on sub-10ms response times in userspace is broken by design.
I have written a driver with similar timing requirements, and I have 
done it in the kernel. This is the right way to go. Nothing else.
