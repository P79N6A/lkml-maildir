Who's time would be well spent?
Not mine because I don't want a stable API. Not mine because I
don't use binary drivers and I don't care to encourage them.
[that is, unless you manage to convince me below ;)]
Anyone else is free to fork the kernel and develop their own
stable API for it. I don't think I would go so far as to call
that time well spent, however.

How? I'm quite willing to listen, but throwing around words like 'guided
development' and 'scalability' doesn't do anything. How does the lack of a
stable API inhibit my kernel development work, exactly?

I've got a fairly good idea of what work I'm doing, and what I'm planning
to do, long term goals, projects, etc. What would be the key differences
with "non-GNU/OpenSource" development that would make you say they are not
unguided by nature?

Let's not bother with bad analogies and stick to facts. Do you know how
many people work on the Linux kernel? And how rapidly the source tree
changes? Estimates of how many bugs we have? Comparitive numbers from
projects with stable APIs? That would be very interesting.
Thanks,
