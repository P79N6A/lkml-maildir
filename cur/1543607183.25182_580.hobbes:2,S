No one doubts XFS is stable.  It is a great fs.  But XFS includes some
modifications to block layer and such that people aren't ready to merge
yet -- XFS touches a lot of stuff.  During 2.5, the better bits of the
modifications will be used and then XFS can be merged properly.  Perhaps
once this proves stable a backport to 2.4 can be done.
