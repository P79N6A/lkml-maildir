that was my conclusion as well!

I'll be happy to test patches that come up. I'm currently running 
2.6.13-rc6-mm1, because it also has the sis190 ethernet driver in it, 
which actually does work :-)
Unfortunately I'm not able to check the logic of the driver, because 
although I can read C, I'm totally unfamiliar with the disk controler 
logic in the kernel...
Cheers
