Managed to boot all versions (though some ext3 journal replay
  showed up even after clean shutdowns), seems to be okay and
  mashed my disk with installing of Portal today - no issue,
  only a positive note for the 2.5.13 VM which allowed me to
  finish in 48' what 2.4.19-pre7 couldn't finish in over 2h.
Dell laptop with a PIIX4 chipset, btw.
