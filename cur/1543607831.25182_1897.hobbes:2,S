"easily triggerable"?
I doubt you'll find _any_ system where you can trigger it. Think about it:
in order to get the kind of VM pressure that causes page-outs, your TLB
pressure will be a lot higher than _any_ CPU I have ever heard about.
256 TLB entries is considered "a lot". Tagged or not, if the VM pressure
is so big that we need to swap, those 256 entries are a grain of sand in
sahara.
