I duped the bug to 2544. I've got the BIOS folks looking at this issue
on the x305 for the proper fix. 
Looking closer at the proposed workaround by Maciej posted here:
http://linux.derkeiler.com/Mailing-Lists/Kernel/2004-04/3174.html
Why exactly are we using cpu_has_tsc to switch this? I'm not sure I'm
following how this is TSC dependent. Additionally the comment change
looks to be from the 2.4 era. 
Maciej, could you further explain? 
thanks
