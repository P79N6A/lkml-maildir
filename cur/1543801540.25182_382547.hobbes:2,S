Subject: [PATCH] i386 io_apic: Use correct index variable when computing the apic that is in ExtInt mode.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Somehow in all of the chaos this one line bug fix got merged with
the another patch and was then discarded when issues were found
with that other patch.
 From: Vivek Goyal <vgoyal@in.ibm.com>
  A minor fix to the patch which remembers the location of where i8259 is
  connected.  Now counter i has been replaced by apic.  counter i is having
  some junk value which was leading to non-detection of i8259 connected to
  IOAPIC.
