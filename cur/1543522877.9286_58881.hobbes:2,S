It was my understanding that PCI allowed interrupts to be shared between
devices.  Certainly Windows seems to have no trouble running all of the
same devices on the same IRQ, as you can see from my original post.
My BIOS (Phoenix NoteBios) unfortunately does not allow for interrupts
to be assigned or reserved.
Thanks for your input,
