Shared libraries in the kernel are pointless.
A shared library is a common library that can be shared between different
address spaces. That is not needed, because the kernel has only one 
(kernel) address space.
When kernel modules are loaded they can export symbols, and other kernel
modules can use it. When the kernel wants to use functions in external
modules it can use kmod/kerneld (with a bit of bootstrapping, the external
module has to put the needed address into some hook which the kernel
will call then, this is usually done with some shared structure like
a device).
So all things you would want from shared libraries are already there.

This is only a short term stopgap solution. For example extensions to the
Linux source architecture (the ALSA project) will probably not well handled
by OSS.

This would only work out if the library (lib*.a not .LIB btw@) is very thin.
Things like disabling interrupts or translating kernel addresses to bus
addresses are all done with inline functions or macros in Linux, and the
interface is only defined for source code portability. There is just no
stable ABI for kernel modules.   
Also it does not address the issue of porting the drivers to other 
architectures like Sparc,Alpha,Merced,ARM.
