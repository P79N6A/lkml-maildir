You misunderstand me.  Consider the difference between:
	strcpy(d, s)
	strlcpy(d, s, sizeof(d));
	strncpy(d, s, sizeof(d));
strncpy zeros the remainder of d if strlen(s) < sizeof(d), but does not
zero terminate the buffer if strlen(s) == sizeof(d).  (Note: this is
how strncpy under the Linux kernel is supposed to work, and yes, the
generic strncpy version in lib/string.c is still buggy.)
strlcpy copies up to the smaller of strlen(s)-1 and sizeof(d)-1, and
ensures that the string is null terminated.  If strlen(s) < sizeof(d)-1,
bytes in d will not be written.
Note my final sentence there.  Consider the following:
	char foo[256];
	strlcpy(foo, "hello", sizeof(foo);
	copy_to_user(uptr, foo, sizeof(foo));
That ends up writing uninitialised kernel data to (unprivileged) user
space.  So would strcpy() used in that situation.
strncpy() on the other hand, will zero the rest of the buffer (on x86
at least) but you'll have to manually ensure that there is a terminator
on the end.  Or, you use strlcpy but memset the entire space you're
copying the string into beforehand, which could be wasteful.
Note: we should really fix the generic strncpy() - there are places in
the kernel source which rely on the x86 strncpy() behaviour today (eg,
binfmt_*.c core file generation.)
