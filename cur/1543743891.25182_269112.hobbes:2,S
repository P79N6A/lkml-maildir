i did so from a current tree (bk pull, undo, -r get) and it's working
fine (url wraps):
http://www.nerdbynature.de/bits/prinz/2.6.10-rc1/dmesg-no-oops-2.6.9_a1.2000.7.2.txt
so i can see with "bk changes" that the ChangeSet is still there. this is
what i expected, because -a says:
- -a<rev>   Remove all changesets which occurred after <rev>.
what i did not expect is that this ChangeSet is now *not* the culprit,
because there is no oops. am i right? [1]

i've build from linux-2.6.10-rc1.tar.bz2 with patch-2.6.10-rc1-bk17.bz2
from kernel.org with the same .config and "modprobe snd-ens1371" oopses as
expected :(

yes, i wanted to undo the alsa changes because i suspected the alsa
framework (sorry guys) and wanted to see if it still oopses when the
latest alsa patch was not appied.
i did another thing: i enabled the (deprecated) OSS driver (es1371.ko)
tried to load this thing:
http://www.nerdbynature.de/bits/prinz/2.6.10-rc1/dmesg-debug_oops-OSS.txt
it oopses.
- - you said it's not a b0rken pci thingy
- - i have to assume now that it's not an ALSA issue (since oss oopses too)
- - it is OSS? the driver? i've CC'ed linux-sound...

yes, like Documentation/BUG-HUNTING says. but i seem to have difficulties
in using my tools (bk). sorry for that.

yes, i really hope that it's not just a user error (on my side). building
kernels since 2.0...but you never know...
thanks again for help,
Christian
(whose only wish these days is to get over this strange thing and not
wasting peoples precious time with a "sound driver". hey, at least  the
box is booting...)
