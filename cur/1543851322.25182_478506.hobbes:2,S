That's right.

Yes, I do.  But I've just tried booting with "noapic" and with "nolapic"
and with "noapic nolapic", but none of those make any difference.
(That is, they make no difference to the FnF4-ineffective-after-resume
behaviour that I'm finding fairly easy to reproduce at will today on
2.6.19-rc4; whereas yesterday it was seeming to me that -rc4 was much
better than -rc3 in this regard.  Something I have learnt today is that
the key is ineffective "for a while", but may become effective later.
It's conceivable that the behaviour I'm reproducing today is not quite
the same as what I was experiencing earlier with real-life suspends.)
More to the point, with great hope in my heart, I've tried backing
out Andi's git-cf4c6a2f27f5db810b69dcb1da7f194489e8ff88.patch
to arch/i386/kernel/io_apic.c, the one which Michael and Linus have
homed in on.  But sadly that makes no difference for me: I'd better
get down to my own bisection.
