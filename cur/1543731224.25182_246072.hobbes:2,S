NAT is limited to count(official addresses)*65535 connections anyway.
One of the most important features of IPv6 is to reconcile today's
interNAT to a homogenous internet as it was before and intended to be.
If someone wants then to put 32k hosts behind a single linux router he
would better provide the necessary hardware for it.
