SUPPORT_VLB_SYNC is now unconditionally hardcoded to 1 in
drivers/ide/ide-taskfile.c.
While most architectures disable it, which no longer works:
| tux$ find include -type f | xargs grep SUPPORT_VLB_SYNC
| include/asm-cris/ide.h:#undef SUPPORT_VLB_SYNC
| include/asm-cris/ide.h:#define SUPPORT_VLB_SYNC 0
| include/asm-m68k/ide.h:#undef SUPPORT_VLB_SYNC
| include/asm-m68k/ide.h:#define SUPPORT_VLB_SYNC 0
| include/asm-mips/ide.h:#undef  SUPPORT_VLB_SYNC
| include/asm-mips/ide.h:#define SUPPORT_VLB_SYNC 0
| include/asm-ppc/ide.h:#undef	SUPPORT_VLB_SYNC
| include/asm-ppc/ide.h:#define SUPPORT_VLB_SYNC	0
| include/asm-sparc/ide.h:#undef  SUPPORT_VLB_SYNC
| include/asm-sparc/ide.h:#define SUPPORT_VLB_SYNC 0
| include/asm-sparc64/ide.h:#undef  SUPPORT_VLB_SYNC
| include/asm-sparc64/ide.h:#define SUPPORT_VLB_SYNC 0
| include/linux/ide.h:#ifndef SUPPORT_VLB_SYNC		/* 1 to support weird 32-bit chips */
| include/linux/ide.h:#define SUPPORT_VLB_SYNC	1	/* 0 to reduce kernel size */
Wouldn't it be better to enable it on architectures which can have a VESA local
bus (ia32 only?) only?

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
