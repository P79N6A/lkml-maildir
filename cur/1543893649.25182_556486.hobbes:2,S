For bay devices, we can use ACPI just like we do now.  For non-bay devices,
we can implement hotplug via polling when ALPM is enabled.  In my experience
most laptop vendors implement extra drive as either PATA in a dock station, 
USB in a dock station, or a bay device either on the dock station, or 
on the laptop itself.
