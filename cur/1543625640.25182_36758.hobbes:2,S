Well, please work off current 2.4.18/2.4.19-pre kernels.
Apply 
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/3c59x.patch
 so that
we're in sync.
Have a BIOS fiddle - disable any power management options,
disable APM/ACPI in kernel config, etc.
Then please go through the steps in the final section of
vortex.txt and send me all the output.
The 556 and 556B documentation has never been sighted,
but it's probably something silly.    Also please send
me the `lspci -vvvxxx' output when the card is fully
initialised, so I can compare it with my 556b.
Thanks.
