Not quite correct as far as I understand it. mmiowb() is supposed to
guarantee that writes to MMIO space have completed before continuing.
That of course covers the multi-CPU case, but it should also cover the
write-combining case.

I wary of adding yet another variation unless there is a clear
distinction between them that is easy to understandn for driver authors.
