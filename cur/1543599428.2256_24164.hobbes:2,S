Let's assume it does. Joe Hacker uses the new min macro and uses int
because this_residual is an int. Later he realizes that this_residual
must be an unsigned int. Will he now also automatically change the type
in the min macro?

How does the new macro help here? A negative value is invalid and so
should be tested _explicitly_.
What about code like this:
	if (len > BUFFER_SIZE)
		return -EINVAL;
This is not automagically fixed by this macro. So your new macro fixes a
few problems and hides other problems. I can't call this a solution.

I'm not arguing against a single (and correct) definition of min/max.
This had to be fixed of course.

But this assumption is only encoded once. Are you going to change the
min interface every second release, just to keep people thinking about
the types they're using? Breaking interfaces is fine, but it only works
_once_ and is simply forgotten afterwards. To quote my other argument,
that is still unanswered:
You maybe fixed a few bugs, but this new macro will only cause new
problems in the future. If we change only a single type, you have to
scan all min/max users if they possibly need to be changed too. Thanks
to the cast, the compiler won't even remotely help you finding them.
bye, Roman
