I think that's trying to kill a fly with a cannon.  Especially since 
afterwards the process in UML would still need to be somehow protected 
from calling UML syscalls - I'm not quite sure how UML works (never really 
used it), but I'm assuming it will still allow getuid/gettimeofday etc 
syscalls.  Correct me if I'm wrong _or_ if i'm misinterpreting your idea.
Besides sometimes these processes are spawned in the dozens (sometimes 
they spawn massively with very little CPU intensity, other times very 
rarely but with massive CPU use) - would I then need a seperate UML kernel 
per spawn? and if not then how would this help?
Thx,
MaZe.
