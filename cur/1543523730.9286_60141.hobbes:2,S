Ok, it looks like the disc is open. The problem with open discs and the
cdrom driver is it reads the TOC to determine the last block on the CD, but
open CD's have no TOC. So, the cdrom driver thinks the disc is empty and
prevents reads on any blocks on the disc.
It is possible to manually adjust blk_size for the device and get things
working but it is definitely not the best solution.
