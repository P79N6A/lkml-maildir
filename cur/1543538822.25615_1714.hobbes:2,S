We've been doing some testing with multiple mount points for our web 
server using the 2.4.0-test kernels.
It appears that we can first mount a filesystem read-write and then mount the
same file system read-only on a different mount point.  The problem is that
the read-only mount isn't. We can touch files and write to the file system.
So the question is....  Is this the intended behavior?  I've looked all over 
and can't find any docs on how multiple mounts are supposed to work.  I can 
see where it might be difficult to implement differing policies on different 
mount points so it's understandable, but it definitely needs to be documented 
somewhere.
Thanks,
Tom
