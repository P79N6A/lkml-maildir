Cool, could you send me the qlogic diff? It's the one-liner can_dma32
chance I'm interested in, I'm just not sure what driver you used :-)
I'll add that to the patch then. Basically all the PCI cards should
work, I'm just being cautious and only enabling highmem I/O to the ones
that have been tested.

You are right, this is definitely something that needs checking. I
really want this to work though. Rik, Andrea? Will the balancing handle
the extra zone?
