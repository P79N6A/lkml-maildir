The problem is that if you do this, it is easy for the swapper to
generate huge amounts of async IO without actually freeing any real
memory: there's a question of balancing the amount of free memory we
have available right now with the amount which we are in the process of
freeing.  Setting the nr_async_pages bound to 256 just makes the swapper
keen to send a whole 1MB of memory out to disk at a time, which is a bit
steep on an 8MB box.
