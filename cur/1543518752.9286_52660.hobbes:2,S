This is planned, but as you say:

Yep.  The journal format already has support for shared journals in
principle, but doing the right thing when some of your filesystems may
be missing is nasty.

That's already how it works.  ext2 and ext3 are different codebases in
the kernel, but apart from the existance of a journal file, a
cleanly-unmounted ext3 filesystem can be mounted as ext2 quite happily.

Yes.
