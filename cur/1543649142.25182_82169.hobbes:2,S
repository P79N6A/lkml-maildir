One thing that at least has to make it in for generic cd recording to be
useful, is my sgio patches. Latest dump of just that is here:
*.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/axboe/patches/v2.5/2.5.44/
Same ones as posted under the 'zero copy dma cd writing and ripping' the
other day, however patch also fixes several races and just plain sloppy
code (sorry Linus). So that's pretty much a given.
Some of the items on this list seems to be more driven by naive
corporate hope rather than reality...

Hans thinks there's a chance in hell that anyone would want to merge
code that's never actually been posted anywhere yet (do correct me if
I'm wrong, but not even Hans gave me a straight answer on that one) is
beyond me.
