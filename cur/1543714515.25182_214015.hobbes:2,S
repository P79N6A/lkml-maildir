we'd need to break the loop after need_resched returns 1 (and then the
second time we'd just screw the latency and go ahead).  I also wanted to
make it a spinlock again like in 2.4, the semaphore probably generates
overscheduling. OTOH the spinlock saved some cpu in slightly different
workloads with big truncates (plus it made the cond_resched trivial w/o
requiring loop break) and I agree with Andrew about that, Martin isn't
benchmarking the other side, the one that made Andrew to change it to a
semaphore.
