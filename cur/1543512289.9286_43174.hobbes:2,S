	I will do these. From the information I've seen, the best thing is probably
	to use a struct with two 32 bit values in it. Is there agreement in this area?
	If so, I'll start working this weekend.
See my post earlier this week (by Andries Brouwer).
You will end up with (at least) two structs - a majorstruct with
per-major stuff, and a minorstruct to which a kdev_t is a pointer.
