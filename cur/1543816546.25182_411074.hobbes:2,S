Although it is quite irrelevant to LKML (you may want to visit 
www.vmware.com/community/index.jspa and ask there...), you can connect guest's 
serial port also to Unix socket - and in such situation you need virtual serial 
port driver only if 'host - application' does not know how to use /dev/tty* (for 
unix socket <-> /dev/ptyp* app look at 
http://platan.vc.cvut.cz/ftp/pub/vmware/serpipe.tar.gz
).
