No, I'm suggesting that the machine will hang forever sometimes and no
amount of patching up netpoll or JBD, etc. will fix that. A hardware
watchdog is a requirement for robust failover anyway and if you think
otherwise, you're dreaming.
And for reference, both are examples of theoretical
should-never-happen memory allocation failures.

What's clear is that you didn't like my position from my very first
post in this thread and immediately went for the nuclear option
without even trying to discuss it.
Are you even aware that the patch we're discussing here is for a problem
that has yet to be observed and that Steven's initial analysis had
missed a couple things?
