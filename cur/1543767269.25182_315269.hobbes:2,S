None of this helps in the situation Miklos is considering, where the
attacker is a user on the client doing the mount.  So presumably the
user gets to choose a server under his/her control, and all the
authentication does is prove to the user that s/he got the right server,
which doesn't protect the kernel at all.
The only defense is auditing the client code's handling of data it
receives from the server.
