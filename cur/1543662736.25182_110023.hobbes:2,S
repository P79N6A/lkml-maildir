Thx. Patch to bump the version number up attached.

Yes. I'm trying to keep the drivers in both trees in sync.

Look at the rest of the driver and you will find the reset voodoo magic is
a perfect fit. We'd be waving dead chickens if only tar could handle them.
Actually, the reset logic is slightly better because for every line I have
some reasoning and actual tests conducted. The underlying problem is that
the Rhine is only loosely documented and various revisions differ in
amazing ways from each other and from the documentation that supposedly
describes them.
I've named the magic register in the patch below, does that ease your
voodoo pain?
I've been considering for a while to document the driver somewhat better.
Are documentation patches welcome, or do you just want to have official
word from VIA that they agree with the reset code? And if I need a few
lines to explain some voodoo magic, is the prefered way to put it into the
source or would a freshly created Documentation/network/via-rhine.txt be
(my first choice but the directory typically contains user rather than
developer documentation) the better place?

Heh. If I had a contact at VIA I'd have many and more important questions
than the reset sequence that actually works now, unlike lots of other
stuff. Yes, reliable information from within VIA -- official or not --
would be a big help.
