remember, the policies define a white-list
so if a hacker wants to have mozilla access the mail files he needs to get 
some other process on the sysstem to create a link or move a file to a 
path that mozilla does have access to. until that is done there is no way 
for mozilla to access the mail through the filesystem.
other programs could be run that would give mozilla access to the mail 
contents, but it would be through some other path that the policy 
permitted mozilla accessing in the first place.
