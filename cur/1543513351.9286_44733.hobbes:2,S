That's indeed the way to go except that I wouldn't trust PGP's authors
to get their software right.  Given how PGP-2.6 handled "filter mode"
(aka `cat >/tmp/<tmpfile>; pgp /tmp/<tmpfile>; cat /tmp/<tmpfile>',
no need to tell you how great it works for backing up 2GB with a 100MB /tmp
partition, and this is ignoring the efficiency issue), I'd rather go for
GPG or somesuch tool written by people who have at the very least a
foggy idea of what "unix tool" means.
