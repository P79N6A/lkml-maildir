Hi Andrew,
this patch is a bug fix that should be included in 2.6.14.
The klist bus_find_device/driver_find_device rework has introduced
the bug. The machine will oops if an online ccw device that has
been detached gets reconnected.
blue skies,

[patch] s390: ccw device reconnect oops.
From: Cornelia Huck <cohuck@de.ibm.com>
Search for a disconnect ccw_device on the ccw bus rather than on the css bus
(was a typo in patch I did for the klist conversion). A cast to an embedding
ccw_device from an embedded device in a struct subchannel will lead us to
oopses.
