Strange. It did hang badly for me - sometimes - _only_ when I tried to use
interrupts (that do not occur).
In polling mode it did not oops at all! - while I installed Debian
base system from CD or ran multiple throughput tests - all over dtc3181e
(no other scsi controllers or ide disks present).
It may depend on scanners behaviour :(
Another note about dtc3181e card - throughput with "native" Win NT drivers
was even worse than I achieved under Linux.
That means, give up all hopes to use it for something besides scanner :-/
or as "_very_ poor man"'s scsi controller.
