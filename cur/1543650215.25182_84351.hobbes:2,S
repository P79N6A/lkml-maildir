that's unrelated to the vm code though (in terms of per-zone lru
mentioned by Andrew for 2.5 that in turns breaks all the aging
information compared to 2.4), that is meant to definitely fix another
highmem unbalance bug where all the lowmem could be pinned and made
unfreeable by lowmem users despite plenty of highmem is still available.
That's the fix to the google mlock deadlock, mainline has a weak attempt
to fix it in another manner, but I backed it out since it's too weak to
be effective in the real workloads (it didn't fix the problem in real
life) and I instead kept my first approch that is THE definitive fix.
btw, 2.5 has still the weak approch, so it's still subject to the google
bug, I will fix it in my tree while moving to 2.5.

Right.

(PS about your previous comment on the swap needed: kernels <= 2.4.9
 (9 != 19) also have the problem that vm+swap isn't all the vm that vmware
 can use, for them you need the double of swap)
