Just speaking generally, rather than about this particualr patch...
Gabor did quite an amount of valuable work here: tested a 2.6.20.x kernel,
developed a test case for reproducing the bug, reported it all quite
exhaustively, tested the resulting patch.
The least we can do in return is to put a big fat "thanks" in the changelog
when the fix gets merged.
