Eric,
Please check the version I modified for LinuxBIOS from your
usbdebug_direct.
Put the related info in
struct ehci_debug_info {
        void *ehci_base;
        void *ehci_op_base;
        void *ehci_debug_base;
        unsigned devnum;
        unsigned endpoint_out;
        unsigned endpoint_in;
	int inited;
};
So for CAR stage code, I could put it the range after stack and easy to
retrieve.
