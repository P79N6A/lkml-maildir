You combat an imaginary problem. What overuse?
-                       read_ahead[MAJOR(dev)] = arg;
+                       blk_dev[MAJOR(dev)].read_ahead = arg;
You make ugly code even uglier. In my source that line reads
			dev->majordev->read_ahead = arg;
You still do not want to view a kdev_t as a pointer
to a struct with information?
