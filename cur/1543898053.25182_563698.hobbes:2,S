I think the main option: acpi=on is usually needed.
If you, guys, are not exhausted yet, I think you could try to
turn off (or change for somethig else) most of the options from
"Processors type and features", and maybe something below PCI
support. But there are many new options which couldn't be turned
off so easy, so there is no much hope...

I wonder if you tried to change the place - I've read this
advice many times. And maybe it would be better to try with
one card at first?
It seems there are some patches with dev->tx_timeout but it
looks like fixing results only. Let's wait...
