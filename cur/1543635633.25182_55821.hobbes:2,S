Yes.  Of course, drivers tend to be more lax about registering things
*then* setting up the internal stage than filesystems, so they have a
race even without failure (this is, of course, entirely soluble one
driver at a time).

try_inc_mod_count() is a hack.  I'm not allergic to hacks: from a
purist POV, any module solution short of "anything can be a module" is
a hack, but you should realize its weaknesses.
As implemented, it results in spurious failure.  Failing to do
something because the module was being removed at the time, and
falling back to module load fails because the old module hasn't
released some resource yet.

Sure, but you must define what interfaces modules are allowed to use,
Al.  And any module using an interface not on those lists can't be
unloaded.
