What could be done is leave the stack where it is, but have
malloc() space and mmap() space grow towards each other:
0                                            3G
| |prog | malloc -->         <-- mmap | stack |
The stack will get the stack size ulimit size and the space
between where malloc and mmap start should be about 2.7 GB.
That 2.7 GB will of course by divided between malloc and mmap,
but the division will be done dynamically based on whoever
needs the space.  Much better than the current static 1:1.7
division...
