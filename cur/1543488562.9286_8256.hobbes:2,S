    Unless you want to do it the right way.
    Userspace bolt-ons are spiffy iff you stick within the environment
    the designer the bolt-on set up for you.  If you walk outside that
    environment, all of a sudden things don't work anymore, so (for
    instance) a LD_PRELOAD will mysteriously fail when you run a
    statically linked rm command, or a hacked ELF library will fail
    when you have the temerity to run an a.out executable.
