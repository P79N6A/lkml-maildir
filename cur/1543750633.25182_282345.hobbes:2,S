Actually in 2.4.x and 2.6.x (except 2.6.9-ac and 2.6.10-ac) its
essentially unusable and full of races and should always be avoided.

In 2.6.9-ac and 2.6.10-ac the ide_unregister_hwif calls return an error
if the drive is in use. At this point the ide-cs code still throws it
away. The -ac code IDE also adds "removed_hwif_iops" so the bits are
there for the correct result which is something like
	if(ide_unregister_hwif(hwif) < 0 {
		printk("Whine whine...");
		removed_hwif_ops(hwif);
		while(ide_unregister_hwif(hwif) < 0)
			msleep(1000);
	}
I've just not had time yet to propogate this into the drivers and into
the new PCI helper for hotplugging IDE controllers.
