Please, don't do that, export another function that does exactly that.
sys_munmap is declared as asmlinkage, and some architectures (at
least ppc used to have) need especial code to be able to call
asmlinkage functions from inside the kernel.
Declaring a __sys_munmap() that does the work and is exported and then
sys_munmap to be only the syscall entry is better.
asmlinkage long sys_munmap(unsigned long addr, size_t len)
Later, Juan.
