As an optimization  I can't think of a reason.
It is kind of interesting to report that information by cpu.
in /proc/interrupts  (see show_interrupts).
But except for understanding system behavior I can't think of a reason
for reporting that information.
It was useful information to have when debugging the irq migration code.
