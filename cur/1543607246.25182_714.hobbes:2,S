For the vendors I think that is a reasonable expectation. Right now I know
of no vendor who supports a binary only driver at all. Its only feasible to
do that with partnership agreements, complex piles of SLA's that of course
all turn out useless when the binary vendor goes bankrupt (which happens
ask any Aureal user)
