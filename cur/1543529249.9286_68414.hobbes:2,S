'somebody' chose the correct way years ago when the symbol export
mechanism was changed from X() to EXPORT_SYMTAB().  All modules that
export symbols must be defined in LX_OBJS, OX_OBJS, MX_OBJS or
MIX_OBJS.  If, and only if, a module is defined in *X_OBJS, the
makefile rules in Rules.make will include -DEXPORT_SYMTAB in the gcc
command.  Create a bad Makefile and you get a bad compile - GIGO.
