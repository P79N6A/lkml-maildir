For those besides me who were wondering where this is documented, 
find . ! -type d ! -type l -exec grep "reboot=" {} \; -print
of /usr/src/linux revealed that it is only documented in
./Documentation/Changes
Here is the pertinant paragraph:
General Information
===================
   <CTRL><ALT><DEL> now performs a cold reboot instead of a warm reboot
for increased hardware compatibility.  If you want a warm reboot and
know it works on your hardware, add a "reboot=warm" command line option
in LILO.  A small number of machines need "reboot=bios" to reboot via
the BIOS.
Note that ./Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt only contains:
    reboot=             [BUGS=ix86]
