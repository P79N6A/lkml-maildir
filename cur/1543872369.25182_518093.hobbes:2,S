Personally, I think this is really really needed. I'm surprised that you already 
didn't push this considering Andrew pulled this into -mm immediately.
We've also been crunching this patch in our labs for a whole week now doing all 
sorts of load/unload up/down torture and it's a real improvement. Especially 
ESB2 systems were hit with this bug irregardless of the DEBUG_SHIRQ code active 
or not, so it's a real bug with real fix.
but hey, it doesn't fix a new problem :)
