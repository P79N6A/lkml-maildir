Yeah, I thought about that a lot, but I couldn't come up with a
constructive suggestion.  The best I could come up with to have kbuild
generate a shell script helper or use a shell script helper to
actually build each .o file.  However, the speed hit probably makes
that unacceptable, although it would make it easier, I suspect, to use
that abstractionas part of making something which ccache or distcc
could use to cache (or distribute to a cluster) all of the steps
needed to build each object file.  Maybe a helper C program instead?
