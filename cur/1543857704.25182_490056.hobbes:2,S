Probably the former, probably the latter.
There may be situations in which we want do to "create this sysfs file if
it doesn't already exist", but I'm not aware of any such.
Generally speaking, if sysfs file creation went wrong, it's due to a bug. 
The result is that the driver isn't working as intended: tunables or
instrumentation which it is designed to make available are not present.  We
want to know about that bug asap so we can get it fixed.
