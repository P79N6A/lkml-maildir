I have compiled my kernel with my /dev/changer patch
it compiles without problems but.... when I try to insmod the driver....
it does the following:
[3] root@heaven:/vol1/home/jeroen# insmod changer
Using /lib/modules/2.2.14-changer/block/changer.o
/lib/modules/2.2.14-changer/block/changer.o: unresolved symbol memset
What went wrong ????
