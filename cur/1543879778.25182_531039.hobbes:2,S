See patches in following messages ... a preliminary "gpio_chip" core
for such a framework, plus example support for one SOC family's GPIOs,
and then updating one board's handling of GPIOs, including over I2C.

Actually, no ... there was a pressing need to adopt some simple basic
interfaces, but no such need for implementation infrastructure to
support fancier features (until the basic interface was in use).
Plus, that code was barely proof-of-concept.
The fact that there are now three simple generic drivers (i2c-gpio,
leds-gpio, gpio_keys) and various additional drivers using those same
interfaces -- working already on multiple platforms! -- illustrates
that anything more than a programming interface, with support on a
handful of "seed" platforms, wasn't required initially.

I said "implementation choice" not "extensible interface"; those
are two very different approaches.
You keep bringing C++ into this.  You may not know that doesn't
win points in Linux.  If the point is solid, it doesn't need to
rely on parallels to languages that won't be used in the kernel.
(Plus, why would you imply C++ class libraries don't need to
have implementations?)

Not what I said.  You said "will", I said "can"; there's a big
difference.  Consider that for example the OMAP infrastructure
for GPIOs already has a fair amount of indirection, while most
other platforms started more simply ... some of them only
included inlines, others just had simple accessor functions.
My "can" allows all those; your "will" disallows most of them.
And none of them unified that model with non-SOC GPIOs.

Again, not what I said.  The implementations there today just
wrap pre-existing GPIO code which mostly addressed SOC support
since that's the first thing that's needed.  But extensibility
has always been on the agenda.  It's just *details* of how to
extend that have been deferred ... not just by this iteration
of the interface, but by all the preceding platform-specific
ones too.

Again, not what I said ... I've discouraged changing/extending the
programming interface.  But I've certainly pointed out ways that
existing performance expectations can be preserved without changing
that programming interface.

Many folk working with embedded hardware will be more than willing
to do exactly that, should performance be a factor.  Especially if the
platform code is written so it's straightforward ...

By "bureaucracy" I presume you mean the existence of opaque cookies?
Or do you mean the implied resource tracking?  (Remember that one of
the most basic tasks of an operating system is resource management...)

So you're agreeing that, at a technical level, what I described
could be augmented by a "caching" facility ... giving a programming
interface with all the characteristics of your "GPIODEV" thingie.
All you're really disagreeing with is bootstrapping issues; and
whether there is in fact a need for such a layer.  The only argument
I could possibly buy is that it avoids the lookup of (b) ... but
that doesn't seem to matter in most cases I've looked at.
Consider the following /sys/kernel/debug/gpio dump, associated
with one system running the patches I'm posting in other followup
messages:
Controller: MPUIO, 192..207, irqs
  GPIO 193 ( 1): in  hi (  tps65010), IRQ 353/falling
  GPIO 194 ( 2): in  lo (    wakeup), IRQ 354/rising wakeup
  GPIO 196 ( 4): out hi (  idle_led)
Controller: GPIO, 0..15, irqs
  GPIO   0 ( 0): in  lo (   smc_irq), IRQ 160/rising
  GPIO   2 ( 2): out hi (  lcd_pwdn)
  GPIO   3 ( 3): out lo ( timer_led)
  GPIO   4 ( 4): in  hi (         ?), IRQ 164/falling
  GPIO   6 ( 6): in  lo (         ?)
  GPIO  11 (11): out lo (  cam_pwdn)
Controller: GPIO, 32..47, irqs
  GPIO  37 ( 5): in  lo (         ?), IRQ 197/rising wakeup
Controller: GPIO, 48..63, irqs
  GPIO  62 (14): in  hi (    cf_irq), IRQ 222/falling
Controller: tps65010, 208..213, can sleep
  GPIO 208 ( 0): out lo (  vbus_dis)
  GPIO 209 ( 1): out lo (  d3:green)
  GPIO 210 ( 2): out lo ( lan_reset)
  GPIO 211 ( 3): out lo (dsp_pwr_en)
  GPIO 212 ( 4): out lo (  d9:green)
  GPIO 213 ( 5): out lo (  d2:green)
Most of those don't get looked up in GPIO tables even once
a week after the system boots ... the exceptions being the
various LEDs, which obviously aren't performance-critical.
IRQs go another path, and the various power controls don't
change often after boot either.
FWIW, GPIO 37 is ttyS0.RXD used to wake up from sleep,
IRQ-164 is the touchscreen IRQ, and GPIO-6 is a busy signal
from the touchscreen that's not actually used.  They don't
yet use gpio_request(), which is why they're not labeled.

The issue I was referring to was abuse of "void *" pointers when
you should have been using typesafe ones.  And the association
with devices was wierd too.
