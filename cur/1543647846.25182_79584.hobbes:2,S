Subject: [PATCH] Add support for Pentax Still Camera to linux kernel.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/10/14/24

This is a very low risk patch.
Attached patch to "/usr/src/linux/drivers/usb/storage/unusual_devs.h" to 
enable the "PENTAX OPTIO 430" USB Still Camera to appear as a SCSI 
/dev/sd* storage device.
This patch works for my kernel version 2.4.18, but should work just as 
well unchanged for 2.4.19.
Patching to 2.5.x has not been tested.
Please include this patch with all future kernels.
Cheers
James Courtier-Dutton
