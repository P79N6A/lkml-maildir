   Sometimes it is needed to let one PCI device do DMA to another part
   of itself or another PCI device.  For this, you need the bus
   addresses of the PCI memory resources.  If
   pci_resource_start(dev,x) doesn't give you that, where else could
   it be found?  By doing configure space reads I guess, but is that
   really necessary?
Actually, there specifically are hacks to go about doing this in
the ncr53c8xx/sym53c8xx drivers.  Search for the pcivtobus() defines
in drivers/scsi/sym53c8xx_comm.h in the current 2.4.x tree.
It certainly deserves to be moved into a common place, perhaps
asm/pci.h is the most appropriate.
