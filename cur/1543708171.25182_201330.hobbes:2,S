You are correct it's the PCI driver list, I misspoke in my original
mail. 
The AIC drivers are currently coded to unload (by returning -ENODEV from
the init function) if no devices are found, so the exit function never
gets called, leaving the stale entries.
There's a 2nd patch in the above thread that changes those modules to
stay loaded even if no devices are found, which Arjan V pointed out was
the preferred way for drivers to work.
