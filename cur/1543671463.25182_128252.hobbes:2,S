Actually, my original proposal will work for popen and all sorts of piping
because of the file descriptor map. For example:
   int   in[2], out[2];
   char *null_argv[] = { NULL };
   int   fmap[4];
   pid_t p;
   pipe(in);
   pipe(out);
   fmap[0] = in[0];                     /* STDIN  */
   fmap[1] = out[1];                    /* STDOUT */
   fmap[2] = open("/dev/null", O_RDWR); /* STDERR */
   fmap[3] = -1;                        /* end    */
   p = nexec("/bin/cat",
             null_argv,
             NULL,
             filmap);
In this case you save the extra closes the child would have to do and you
save the dup's.

Ahem, I happen to know Unix very well, thank you very much. Please read my
proposed API before flaming it out and assuming I know nothing of UNIX,
kernel development, or operating systems in general!
Do you honestly think that just because I picked a name spawn() that
happens to be in VMS (and MS-DOS C compilers) that I am inexperienced to
Unix. Nope. I just happen to be a BSD user in general and don't frequent
LKML.... and now I remember WHY!
And there _ARE_ issues this does solve as were already pointed out because
of the linear scan that must be made on the file descriptor array for the
close-on-exec flag (which this API could happily say it ignores since it
builds a _WHOLE_NEW file descriptor array).
L8r,
Mark G.
