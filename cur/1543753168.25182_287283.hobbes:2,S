I hadn't realised that delay had been added. It wasn't present in the older 
code I was working against and when I upgraded, I've failed to notice it had 
been added. Adding that will solve all the problems I was seeing.

I think the way forward is for someone to propose a patch. Your code sounds 
the most advanced but Ian or myself may be prepared to propose something if 
you don't want to. A decision can then be made about whether it can be 
accepted. There have been no objections raised so far - just words of 
caution.
