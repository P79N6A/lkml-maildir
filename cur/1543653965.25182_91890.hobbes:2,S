Hello Petr,
Nice work.
Can you add/change the comments for the mem and mem=exactmap parameters.
The mem parameter doesn't behave in the same manner as it did before 
2.4.19/20, I think it changed somewhere in the 2.4.19-pre series.
On an old Compaq 2500 with 320Mb memory the following line used to work :
	append="mem=320M"
now I have to use:
	append="mem=exactmap mem=640K@0 mem=319M@1M"
to get the kernel to see all the memory.
On later kernels if I use mem=320M it only sees 16Mb, this is also true for 
2.5.44 (probably true for all the 2.5.x kernels) which I tried on that box.
I don't know if it's only something specific for that box and maybe not 
necessarily true for other systems which have to use the mem parameter.
To me it looks like the mem parameter can now only be used to specify less 
memory then the kernel actually recognizes.
Also can you add how to use the mem=exactmap parameter, it says now that such 
lines can be constructed based on BIOS output or other requirements, that 
doesn't tell me how such a line should look like, I only found out how to use 
it by searching through posts on lkml, maybe you can add the above append 
lines as an example.
Regards,
	GertJan
