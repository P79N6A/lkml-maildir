Heh.  It's pretty crude but I've found it useful even as crude as it is.  I have been 
doing library work instead of kernel work for a little more than a year so I haven't been 
improving it.  That said, I'd be happy to see patches as I expect I'll do kernel work 
again in the future.  I had made a project page for it here: 
http://code.google.com/p/patchstylecheck/
I'll maintain it if people want to send me patches.  I also added Andy to the svn 
commiters list awhile back, so you could bug him as well.

Whitespace damage is the predominant one I've seen as well.  When I was developing it I 
fed it a number of lkml patches at random and fixed all the false positives I encountered.
