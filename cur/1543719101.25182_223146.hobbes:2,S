Would the following variant seem clearer:
	if (!!unknown_nmi_panic == !!old_state)
		return 0;
Odd, I know.  For those of us familiar with the '!!' idiom, which
converts any value to its binary logical equivalent 0 (if zero) or
1 (otherwise), this reads as:
	if (the logical value of unknown_nmi_panic is unchanged)
		return 0;
However, I could easily imagine others finding this variant even
more bizarre.
