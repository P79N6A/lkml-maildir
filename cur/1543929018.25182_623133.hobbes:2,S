Subject: [patch 2.6.24-rc3] rtc-cmos alarm acts as oneshot
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/30/273

Start making the rtc-cmos alarm act more like a oneshot alarm by disabling
that alarm after its IRQ fires.  (ACPI hooks are also needed.)
The Linux RTC framework has previously been a bit vague in this area,
but any other behavior is problematic and not very portable.  RTCs with
full YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM[:SS] alarms won't have a problem here.  Only ones
with partial match criteria, with the most visible example being the PC
RTC, get confused.  (Because the criteria will match repeatedly.)
Update comments relating to that oneshot behavior and timezone handling.
(Timezones are another issue that's mostly visible with rtc-cmos.  That's
because PCs often dual-boot MS-Windows, which likes its RTC to match local
wall-clock time instead of UTC.)
