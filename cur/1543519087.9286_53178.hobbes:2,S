If there are optimized system call paths for other archs that we might
want to make use of.  This came out of the discussion of how to make
use of SYSENTER, after all.

I was thinking that building the jump table on sparc{,64} would be
complex because of their sparse syscall numbers.  On second thought
this wouldn't necessarily be the case.
But that brings up an interesting side issue: are we considering
multiple PER_* or just PER_LINUX?
