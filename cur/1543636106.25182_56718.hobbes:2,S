I included a backtrace in my original post showing that the allocation
failure did indeed occur beneath shrink_cache().
From watching /proc/meminfo it was clear that there were only 1MB or
2MB under writeback, but it also showed that the dirty memory thresholds
were being exceeded. The debugging information obtained was unclear.
The counters reported in /proc/meminfo appear to be accurate.
Cheers,
Bill
