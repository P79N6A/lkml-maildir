kmap_pte and kmap_prot are needed for all drivers that call
kmap_atomic() with HIGHMEM enabled. This is (indirectly) used also in
skbuff, but not sure whether the export is required there. And this is
also used in some peding patches AFAIK.
(local_)flush_tlb_page is already exported with the other archs, but not
ppc. As there's:
#define flush_tlb_page local_flush_page
maybe exporting just flush_tlb_page is enough. I can't remember if I
actually tried it, and have no PPC machine at the moment to do the test. I
don't think it is related to NTFS backport at all. I just met the problem
when trying to compile the kernel with NTFS backport on PPC.
set_buffer_async_io is not used at the moment by NTFS backport but IS used
by reiserfs.
