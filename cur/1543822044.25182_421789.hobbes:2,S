Yeah I agree with Andi that this accounting stuff is probably done
for some POSIX conformance that doesn't matter. Actually it is worse
than that because if anyone _really_ did need it, then they'll get a
horrible surprise when their system mysteriously fails in production.
It should either get ripped out, or perhaps converted to use jiffies
until a sane high resolution, low overhead scheme is developed (if
ever). And that would exclude something that does this accounting in
fastpaths for the 99.99% of processes that never use it.
