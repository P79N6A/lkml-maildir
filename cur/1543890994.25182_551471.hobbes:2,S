Yep, and that would be much easier too.
I am curious though as this seems to be somewhat common a problem, could 
we make the kernel analyze which memory is not cacheable (it already 
knows this via MTRR) and not use that portion for anything? Plus may be 
warn the user to contact their BIOS vendor to correct the problem?
I think that would be possible - even if the kernel knows late that the 
memory was uncached we could migrate those pages in that region to 
someplace else?
