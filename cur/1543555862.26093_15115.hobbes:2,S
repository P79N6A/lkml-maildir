Already long ago open(1) was renamed to openvt(1), so it may be that
have a very old version. See a recent kbd or console-tools.

You misunderstand the function of access(). The standard says
[EROFS] write access shall fail if write access is requested
        for a file on a read-only file system
It does not look at whether you ask write access to a directory
or a special device file (and whether the filesystem was mounted nodev or not).
So, probably you found a flaw in openvt: the use of access is almost always
a bug - it doesnt tell you what you want to know. You may send me a patch
if you want to.
On the other hand, on recent kernels access() doesnt fail in this situation.
That is a kernel bug, I suppose. Will investigate later.
