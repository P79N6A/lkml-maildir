The point is that these hierarchies are all in your mind, and that what is
in your mind and what is in my mind may not be the same.  Give the
programmer the tools to impose the hierarchy he needs at runtime, instead
of picking one at design time.

The enumerator can be as smart as you care to make it.  Just remember that
a decision that I may think of as smart, may seem really stupid to you.
Why not find a way to put off the decision until we know which way it
should go?
