I'm doing that just now.
The code is privileged (currently setuid-root), so it takes a long time
to write. Sometimes it looks like I have more error checking code than
productive code.
Policy is determined by a config file. Liberal admins can let users
make setuid-root executables. :-)
Files become setuid-root. The executable header gets mangled, unless the
executable is already setuid-root.
Currently, you would use a specification file like this:
^^TypeA^^
fP CAP_SYS_RESOURCE CAP_SYS_RAWIO   / Room for 128 bits, but only
fE                                  / 64 can be used with existing code.
fI CAP_NET_BROADCAST
RUID RUID
EUID RUID
SUID RUID
FUID RUID
RGID RGID
EGID games
SGID uucp
FGID RGID
groups games uucp mail
I could add some sort of extended access control to that. I could add
a minimum capability requirement, so that execution fails if the
post-exec capabilities are not enough to complete execution.
There is also a shortcut method that lets you specify capabilities on the
command line. (all 3 fields get the same content -- reasonable?)
I've saved ELF hacking for last. Hopefully I won't need to write my own
ELF support code. (Help!) I don't trust libraries too much, since I don't
want to see my code posted to Bugtraq.
As usual, all code is under the LGPL.
