Of course that would be good, too.
But I think, that we sometimes have the dilemma, that we want to keep
the printks short, but also want to provide as much information as
possible.
If the information is to big for the printk itself, because you would
need 10 lines to explain what happened, wouldn't it be good to have a
place where to put that information?

For each kernel component, like a device driver, we could have one
KMSG_COMPONENT (e.g. "acpi", "pci", etc). Within that component the
message ids have to be unique. A tool could check, if messages are
unique within the kernel sources.
We could use something like a Documentation/kmsg-components file with a
list of all component names using KMSG printks.

I agree with you, that most of the kernel messages do not need further
documentation. But I am convinced, that there are plenty of printks,
where additional documentation would be helpful.

I can understand your frustration here. But that's a general problem
with documentation. You never can foresee everything.
But should this mean, that we shouldn't document anything?
