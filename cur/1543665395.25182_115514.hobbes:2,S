booting my -ac kernel with noapic gets the USB working (hooray and thanks).
I am just recompiling my gentoo-sources kernel to see if I can make that
work (it certainly doesn't without ACPI enabled).
I will play with config files and kernel sources and see if I can determine
whether anything *other* than the -ac branch will work correctly.  Is there
any way that I can usefully help feed that info back to the developers?  Are
there any tests that I can try?
Thanks for your help all
