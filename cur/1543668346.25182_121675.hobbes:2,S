Nooooooooo!
Arrgh !
darn
no wonder my setup is broken after that H/W upgrade
2.2.20 actually works with my PCI NIC (no support for my paradise ATA)
2.4.x does not work with nic or (00:0b.0 Unknown mass storage controller:
                                 Promise Technology, Inc.: Unknown device
                                 4d68 (rev 01) )
2.4.20 slackware 9.0 bare.i works with the PCI NIC and PCI ATA card (no
acpi in this kernel)
is ACPI the problem with this chipset ?
I'd like to get this board working is there any information I can provide that would give
you another data point ....
Just tell me which kernel/patch and what info you need..
