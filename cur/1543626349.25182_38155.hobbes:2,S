Hi all.
I only want to note that there is really a problem with
autonegotiation with the sis900.c driver. We have a sis630 based
Laptop and SiS730 based Workstation using the integrated NIC. They
only autonegotiate once after power-on. When the cable is unplugged
and replugged into a hup/switch/whatever the driver doesn't work
anymore and generates this:
NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth0: transmit timed out
eth0: Transmit timeout, status 00000004 00000000
eth0: Media Link On 100mbps full-duplex
eth0: Media Link Off
error messages. Although I do not know if the posted patch is the
right fix.
