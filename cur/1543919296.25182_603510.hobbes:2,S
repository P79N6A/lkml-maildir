I'm glad you find the kernel so perfect that your best use of time is
to tweak the code added in a non-critical path (performance-wise) with
a new way of checking for hardware features (no other code in the kernel
checks ppc_md function pointers for that purpose).
Pseries can only have mpic or xics, so it's not like it matters if we
check for mpic or !xics, either.
But hey, any color bike shed will do, and I don't care which one Paul
chooses to merge. I will not waste more time debating this simple patch
though. :)
