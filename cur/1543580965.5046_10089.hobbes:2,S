I'm not using any framebuffer on my machine (I have an ATI 3D Rage 128
Pro, myself).  I use the standard 80x50 console, and X when I need
it.  I'm about to put Debian on the system and see how that works and if I
like it, I just got the .ISO of disc 1 downloaded (after about a week) and
now it's burning.  (I hate having a 33.6 connection!)
However the clock drift didn't happen as much, if at all, with 2.2.xx
kernels.  It's kept itself pretty well sane.  But now I'm losing something
on the order of a half hour a week - that didn't happen before.
