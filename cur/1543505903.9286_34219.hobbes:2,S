Yep, I was mostly thinking about several PCI busses (common case on
PowerMacs) and ISA-on-PCI stuffs. I beleive there is no way to be pretty
_and_ efficient when really working with several completely different
busses. Actually, even PCI may be different from one machine to the
other. (Some ARM platforms are not cache coherent for DMA from the PCI,
and I may have to break the coherency assumption in some cases on the
PowerMacs too due to power saving requirements).
