Dear all,
I have few updates in this issue.
I have attached the Images as well as the mount-log to this mail.
Please see the comments inline.

I think, fdisk it trying to portray that n/o cylinders 448. So, it also
takes care of displaying the relevant n/o sector & NO more or NO less.

I have implemented the partition support in the driver but some HOW I am
NOT able to get the driver working with all the sockets. It is just
working with the socket 0 and NO other socket. 
I mean I am able to mount windows & linux formatted SD card with new
driver present from socket 0.

I have an update on this.
I found some common things between the windows formatted SD & Linux
formatted SD.
I found that both of then do NOT have the partition table.
I found that both of them have FAT12 FS in the sector 0 starting at
offset 0.
Why? I am NOT able to guess.
For Windows formatted SD there is NO partition table at all.
I went on more R&D and tried to get to format the USB-Thumb drive.
Even that did NOT have a partition table. 
It looks like windows treats all removable media device as devices with
NO partitions.
Even on Linux formatted SD there is NO partition table present.
Please have a look at the images I am attaching to this mail.
I have attached CAM-MS, WIN-Ms & Linux-MS first 512 byte length Images.
These are the Images of first 512 bytes of sector 0.
You can find the FS there on Lin & Win Images.
I have verified this by keeping some DEBUG messages in the FAT layer &
seeing what data is being passed to this fat_boot_sector structure when
mount call is issued.
I am also attaching those LOG messages. please Have a LOOK at them too &
you will have a fair understanding.
>That one looks more like random numbers.  Maybe the partition entry
that

I have verified it with fdisk -l -u /dev/tfa0 
It has shown that it is the partition 0 & nothing else.
>Could you do dd if=/dev/sda bs=512 count=1 | xxd
Please see the Images-All-MS-512.tar.gz.
