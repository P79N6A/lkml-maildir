One possible problem here is that setting up that timer can be 
considerably more expensive, for a relative timer you have to read the 
current time, which can be quite expensive (e.g. your machine now uses the 
PIT timer, because TSC was deemed unstable).
One question here would be, is it really a problem to sleep a little more?
Another possibility would be to add another sleep function, which uses 
hrtimer and could also take ktime argument.
