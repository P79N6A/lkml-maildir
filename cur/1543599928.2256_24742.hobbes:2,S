It depends on the actual application

IRQ latency isnt the issue. Older x86 processors have dreadful locking 
performance. On an Athlon or later pIII there seems to be very little
difference, but other stuff you can measure it.
Locks cost. On older CPU's atomic operations go back to main memory and on
newer processors they still cause pipeline stalls. Calling back to non
inlined locks has a small hit too.

I doubt they were idiots. I suspect they had different engineering
constraints like "base system must fit on one floppy disk".
