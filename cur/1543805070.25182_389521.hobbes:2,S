And actually, my use of the task->pid member was correct.  The "pid  
virtualization" patches are virtualizing not only the process IDs,  
but the thread IDs as well (the whole point is to provide completely  
unique PID/TID spaces, so everything needs to be virtualized).  In  
any case, it was just a poorly chosen example (because that  
particular virtualization bit was not necessary).  I agree with you  
that the kernel's behavior is weird, but it has its reasons and a lot  
of history.  If you think it's that important, a cleanup patch  
(assuming it's not too intrusive) would probably be welcomed.
Cheers,
