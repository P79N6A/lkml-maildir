Mach wasn't written by GNU, it's a BSD based kernel pried apart into chunks
by people at CMU.

Drivers and networking account for about 50% of the total lines of code.
The bulk of the work in any operating system is typically drivers.  The
generic part of Linux (non-driver, non-file system) is tiny compared to 
the rest.
If the Hurd gets its drivers from Linux then it should rightfully be called
Linux/HURD (or Linux/HURD/GNU).
