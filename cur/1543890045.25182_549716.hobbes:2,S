Subject: [PATCH] mtd/ubi: silence gcc warning

Silence the gcc warning
drivers/mtd/ubi/eba.c: In function ‘ubi_eba_read_leb’:
drivers/mtd/ubi/eba.c:371: warning: ‘crc’ may be used uninitialized in this function
This is an example of the uninit'd-var warnings emitted by gcc that
can be proven to be bogus.
Normally I would commit this to my git repository containing
such verified cases, but with all the goto-driven control flow in
ubi_eba_read_leb(), I feel that initializing the 'crc' variable is
an easy way to both shut up gcc, and also make the code less fragile
for the long term.
