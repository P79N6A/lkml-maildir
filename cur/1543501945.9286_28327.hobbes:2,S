They should not. Even if  "define_bool foo y"  repeats a few times it
does not hurt (unlike other config functions which break menuconfig/xconfig
when repeated).
If you want to avoid it, you can use a hack like:
: if [ "$foo" != "y" ]; then
:   define_bool foo y
Initial  "define_bool foo n"  should be, IMO, replaced by "undef foo",
however, *after* menuconfig/xconfig are fixed to handle "undef" command
properly (I've sent a patch fixing it to Michael <mec@shout.net> a month 
or two ago) ...
Please take these comments into account when creating the final version of
IDE configuration.
