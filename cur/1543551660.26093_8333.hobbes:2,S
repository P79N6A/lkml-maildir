<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Hello,</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>The company I work for has developed a new piece of 
hardware, and we are eager to have the drivers for this hardware included as 
part of the Linux kernel.&nbsp; Currently, we have customers who have been using 
our product for a couple of months, and so far we have had no problems.&nbsp; 
All of the code is open except for an image file that is loaded onto the card 
when the driver is installed that handles it's logic.&nbsp;&nbsp;From here, how 
do we begin the process of getting our drivers included into the 
kernel?</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Regards,</FONT></DIV>
