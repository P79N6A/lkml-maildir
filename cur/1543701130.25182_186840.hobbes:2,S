Yeah, I know. It's one of the downsides of having anal revision control, 
and BK is more anal than most.
I do end up taking patches that have this syndrome if it looks like the 
pain of not taking the messy revision history is larger than the pain of 
just fixing it. Sometimes it's hard to avoid.
But most of the time the proper thing to do is to just not merge
unnecessarily - if something is pending for a while, Bk does the merge
correctly anyway, so you can just leave it pending and have me pull from
an old tree (after you have verified in your own tree that the pull will 
succeed and do the right thing).
That way it ends up being trivial to see where/when the changes happened.
