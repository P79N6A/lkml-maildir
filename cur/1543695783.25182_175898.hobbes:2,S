Okay, I'll keep working at it.  Unfortunately my main test system has
since had a major hardware failure and I haven't gotten a replacement
set up yet.
In the meantime, from a quick look at the kernel code I see this:
  - invocations of /sbin/hotplug normally go through call_usermodehelper.
  - kernel/kmod.c: call_usermodehelper does this prior to scheduling
    any work:
        if (!system_running)
                return -EBUSY;
  - init/main.c: system_running is not set non-zero until just
    prior to starting init. 
So it looks like calls to hotplug are dropped while compiled-in
drivers are initializing.  Or am I missing something obvious?  I
needed a one-line patch to be able to boot into initramfs; do I need
another to enable call_usermodehelper earlier?
