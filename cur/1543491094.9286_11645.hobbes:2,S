Yes, that's how I understood the original text too.
What I don't understand is the example after "new features like ". This
example talks about powering off the computer at halt. This example has
nothing to do with sysklogd AFAIK. And that's what I'm trying to say.
Maybe there should be a different section about init/initscripts that
make poweroff on halt work again with 2.2 kernels. I didn't find the info
about the poweroff in the current Canges file.
