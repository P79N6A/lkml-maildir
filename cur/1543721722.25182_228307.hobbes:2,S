Unfortunately, you're *very* right on this. Eg. read the linux-mips list
(at linux-mips.org). You'll see that this list is often hit by people
having problems. Normally, they hack on kernels like 2.4.16 or the like.
These are totally unrelated projects, people and companies. I can't find
words for that. They're missing a year of development and even feel sane
with it. That's what vendors gave them...
There's a lot of Linux beyond LKML, with a common problem: outdated
source trees, with a shitload of patches. Linus could need another
hacker or two working full-time on reviewing / importing those patches!
For what I guess, those should better be native Indian speakers...
