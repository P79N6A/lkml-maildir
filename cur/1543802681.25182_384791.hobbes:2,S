It's the zone that page belongs to (you won't, I think, get involved
in nodes and sections): see helpful comment on "page->flags layout"
in include/linux/mm.h, and definitions in include/linux/mmzone.h.
I'd have to make a fool of myself by doing arithmetic in public,
probably getting it wrong, to tell you precisely which zone the
8 meant in 2.6.15 in your config; but it's not interesting anyway.
