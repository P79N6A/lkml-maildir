Yes, and the long list of open source licenses listed on the FSF website
as incompatible with the GPL.

In fact most core kernel facilities (spin lock, memory caches, character and
block device interface, even core file system) have had a very stable API
(way back to early 2.4 kernels).  An in fact most of them are derived from
some variant or precursor to UNIX.  For example, memory caches are a Sun
Solaris concept.
It is the lack of an ABI that is most frustrating to these users.

"old-tech"?  No, these are high-tech drivers supported by commercial RTOS,
from which Linux stands to benefit.  And, by not allowing these organizations
to take the first step (generate a workable Linux driver) such a policy
provides them little incentive to ever move the driver to Linux, and cuts
them off from opening it.
I don't think that it is fair to say that an unstable API/ABI, in of itself,
provides an incentive to open an existing proprietary driver.

Well, the lack of a stable ABI is well known.  The API is largely stable (but
not sacrosanctly so) for the major reason that changing it within a large
code base is difficult and error prone at best.
