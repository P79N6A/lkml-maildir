Actually, I think that select/poll is exactly the kind of thing that would 
_not_ improve noticeably, since usually it's only one (out of possibly 
hundreds) or wait-queues that gets woken up. 
So even if that one were to be made faster, the _real_ cost when it comes
to the wait-queues will be all the other 99 waitqueues that select/poll
has to remove itself from the old way anyway.
