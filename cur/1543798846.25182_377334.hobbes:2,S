4kB stacks are already an option for some time. There were some problems 
in the beginning, but as far as we know we have have fixed all of them.
There are so many possible bugs people writing kernel code could 
introduce bugs that cause crashes. The solution is not to add 
workarounds for programming bugs at every possible place, but as the
code review and "make checkstack" before accepting code.
As a data point, my count of bug reports for problems with in-kernel 
code with 4k stacks after Neil's patch went into -mm is still at 0.

There is no workload where 8kB suits better.
