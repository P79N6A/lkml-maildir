That's just a general suggestion with regard to kernel testing.
Recent 2.5.x hasn't had a problem completing LTP runalltests.sh.  
I've used LTP to narrow down a couple early 2.4.x reiserfs bugs to
a specific test case.  LTP has occasionally triggered oops and
livelocks too.  It's a useful regression test.

Yes.

Interesting.  I've seen read-latency2 drop dbench throughput in -aa
kernels (but I use it anyway).  I'd like to capture the request
queue size.  Is there a command or file in /proc that displays 
it, or should I just grep drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c?

I will try that next.
