Yes.
From a baby ptrace demo:
#define SIGSYSTRAP      (SIGTRAP | sysgood_bit)
int sysgood_bit = 0;
void set_sysgood(pid_t p) {
#ifdef PTRACE_O_TRACESYSGOOD
        int i = ptrace(PTRACE_SETOPTIONS, p, 0, (void*) PTRACE_O_TRACESYSGOOD);
        if (i == 0)
                sysgood_bit = 0x80;
        else
                perror("PTRACE_O_TRACESYSGOOD");
#endif
}
and now the signal SIGSYSTRAP signifies a system call when the sysgood bit
was implemented, anything different from SIGSYSTRAP is guaranteed to be a signal.
