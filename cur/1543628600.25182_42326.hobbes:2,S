Linux Version 2.4.18 fails to open the same device-majors as
previous versions when attempting to open /dev/ttyS0, and
/dev/ttyS1.
Apparently something is done out-of-order. It's in an  embedded
system so I can't attempt to open other device-majors in an attempt
to find where they put the first serial port.
Does anybody have a fix?
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
