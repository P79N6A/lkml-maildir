i dont understand what you mean. Any 'use only idle IO capacity' 
mechanism should immediately cease to be active the moment any other app 
tries to do IO - whether the IO subsystem is saturated or not.

well, it's a plain old bug (a not too serious one) in my book, i'm 
surprised that we are now at mail #7 about it :-) I reported it, and i 
guess Con will fix it eventually. There's really no need to deny that it 
exists or to try to talk it out of existence. Sheesh! :-)
