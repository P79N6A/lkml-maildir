OK, I know I'm dumber and dumber everyday, but it seems in a hurry I
got it wrong again or miss something (as usual): these all flushes are
rtnl lockup vulnerable wrt. other work functions, but cancel_work_sync
looks perfectly fine... (Or am I wrong because: ...?)
Then, if by any chance I'm right, something like flush_work_sync
(or changed flush_scheduled_work, if there is no problem with such
a change of implementation) could be safely (if it's called without
locks used by flushed work only) done cancel_work_sync() way, by
running a work function after try_to_grab_pending() returns 1 (after
list_del_init - of course without respecting a queue order).
