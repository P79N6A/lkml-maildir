Hi Hans,
REISER4_FS is the only option with a dependency on !4KSTACKS which is 
bad since 8 kB stacks on i386 won't stay forever.
Could fix the problems with 4 kB stacks?
Running
  make checkstacks | grep reiser4
inside te kernel sources after compiling gives you hints where problems 
might come from.
TIA
Adrian
