I don't know.  I asked the dietLibc people if they would be willing to
create a stripped down version of it and help port it to the remaining
archs that Linux supports, but dietLibc doesn't, and didn't hear
anything back.
It doesn't look like much work to do the stripping (I did a bunch of it
for the latest version of dietHotplug) but the porting, I have no idea
of what is needed there.
Anyone want to start up a klibc project? :)
