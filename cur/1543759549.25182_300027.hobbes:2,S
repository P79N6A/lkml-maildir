On my system, that ends up printing out 4 or 5 lines of output per node,
but it's quite invaluable if you're debugging early memory setup issues.
It is KERN_DEBUG after all.  What does it do on your system?
I'm not horribly opposed to removing some of this output, let's just
make sure...

It's really only used for the i386 NUMA architectures, but it is
necessary.  We'll be overriding that discontigmem version for sparsemem,
which I'll be submitting soon:
