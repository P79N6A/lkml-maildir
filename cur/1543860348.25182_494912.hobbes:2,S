I don't think there is a generic way that works.
(rationale: the bios really has to support VT, for example it has to
load the right microcode into the cpu etc)
Not ruling out that specific machines may be able to force it, but
that's more luck than a general solution if that's the case.
(fwiw the linux-ready firmware developer kit now has a test for
vt-enabling so with some luck more bioses will have this right in the
future)
