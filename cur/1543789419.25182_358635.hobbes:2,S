   Yes, the memory-only node is just another node.  Iterating over all
nodes sounds a little brute force, but I guess it should work.  FWIW,
here's the results of the previous one-liner on an HP Superdome (booting
w/ machvec=dig to use the swiotlb instead of hardware iotlb):
2.6.14-rc4-mm1, before patch:
Placing software IO TLB between 0x4cdc000 - 0x8cdc000
after patch:
Placing software IO TLB between 0x74104e6b200 - 0x74108e6b200
Thanks,
