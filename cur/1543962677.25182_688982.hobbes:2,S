In the case of the problem here it would have turned one problem into 
another, and Roman's patch is the correct solution no matter whether 
you change the semantics of select or not.

It might held up your randconfig compiles.
Actual kernel development isn't much affected.
Before you started your randconfig builds and sending (often buggy) 
kconfig patches like crazy there wasn't a problem (and Toralf's 
randconfig builds already catched these problems in the past).

That's nonsense.
Describe the semantics you want for "bool selects tristate", and no 
matter which you choose I'll tell you a case where it breaks.
You've shown with another of your recent kconfig patches that you don't 
even understand how "depends on" works, and you are _very_ far from 
making claims like the one you just made.
Please accept the fact that while I'm (at least at the moment) not 
qualified to make any deeply technical remarks on e.g. the CPU scheduler 
or x86 details, you are (at least at the moment) not qualified to make 
any deeply technical remarks on kconfig.
