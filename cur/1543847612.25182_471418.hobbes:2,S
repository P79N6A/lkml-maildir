Joerg, when you make resubmissions, please always restate the full
changelog and all signed-off-by lines.
If you want to say "Changed since last version" do that seperately
at the top of the email, right before the main changelog entry and
the patch itself.
I wanted to apply this latest version of these two patches, but I
cannot because the full changelog isn't here.  Please get this
into a mergable form for me.
Thanks a lot.
