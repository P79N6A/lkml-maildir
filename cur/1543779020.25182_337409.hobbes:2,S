Subject: [patch 24/29] USB: Patch for KYOCERA AH-K3001V support
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/7/29/230

From: Masahito Omote <omote@utyuuzin.net>
This patch enables a support of KYOCERA AH-K3001V, one of the most
popular cell phone in Japan. This device has vendor specific ID but works
with acm driver by adding USB ID. This device already works on
FreeBSD and OS X by native USB ACM driver with USB ID added.
This device is probed as NO_UNION_NORMAL not to hang up when probing.
