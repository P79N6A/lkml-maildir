Hi all...
This is  set of small patches that allow a finer tuning of i386 arch, and fix a
small bug:
- 20-x86-p4-prefetch: enables prefetch also for p4. This is a pending bug, IMHO.
- 21-x86-pII: splits Pentium-II as a separate config option; yes some of us
  still have oldies and would like a slightly better optimized kernel
- 22-x86-check_gcc: use check_gcc also for Intel CPUs (like others already do)
  to get better gcc flags.
- 23-x86-mb: implement memory barriers with specific instructions in p3 and p4
  (credits go to Zwane Mwaikambo <zwane@linux.realnet.co.sz>)
Could this ever get into mainline ? Perhaps the only questionable piece is
the mb changes. How about next -pre ?
TIA
