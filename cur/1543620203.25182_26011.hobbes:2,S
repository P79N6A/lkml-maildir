About this particular change-set? Nothing. In fact, most of it is
generated from a shell script before it goes into the BK archive.
The advantage is mainly that (a) you can generate this changeset listing
yourself, and not limit it to the stuff I merged and (b) when the
developers I work with start sending me their bitkeeper merges _as_
bitkeeper merges and we start having the advantage of various tools to
help resolve conflicts.
