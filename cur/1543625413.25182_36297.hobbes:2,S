In my case the problem is indeed fairly general, so I can't seem to count on a
generic parameter. Most callbacks do have them, but not all of them.
Anyway, since you agree the general case requires self modifying code I'll do it
that way. Now I just need to know how to make a page executable in a portable
way (get_free_page on i386 already returns executable pages...)
If anyone's interested in the background of this:
I'm writing a kernel module containing an interpreter for the Python language,
which in turn accesses the kernel functions through a wrapper layer. This
makes writing kernel modules in pure Python possible. I know this is rather sick :)
cheers
Matthias
