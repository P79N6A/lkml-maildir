To wrap up this thread, I heard from someone at Lineo who clarified this is
what they are doing (they didn't mention BSD packages, but I'd guess you are
right about this).  There is nothing all that unusual about this.  Others have
done the same thing.
My concern was based on the ambigious (and arguably deceptive) "not for
resale" wording of their press release, which could be interpreted as claiming
that the entire contents of the Embedix CD was "not for resale," not just the
non-GPL componenets.  Especially because I suspect that the kernel itself is
the bulk of what (if not the only component) one would really want to resell
in an embedded context.
