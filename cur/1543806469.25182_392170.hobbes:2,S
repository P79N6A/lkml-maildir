Hi,
1.) no need to post the same message twice. This is a mailing list so it
may take some time until a response is written.
2.) This is the absolute wrongest list you could find for your question.
This mailing list is for linux kernel development. Here we discuss bugs
and pachtes for the linux kernel. We DO NOT answer "I fubared my
computer, plz help"-type of questions.
There are enough linux communities who can help you with your problem
(e.g. linuxquestions.org) please refer to them.
cu
Andre
