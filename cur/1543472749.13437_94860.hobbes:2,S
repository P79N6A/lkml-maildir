Are there advantages in having something like /dev/repeat?
echo -n "echo this" > /dev/repeat
cat /dev/repeat
echo thisecho thisecho thisecho this
echo "echo this now" > /dev/repeat
cat /dev/repeat
echo this now
echo this now
echo this now
echo this now
etc.
Then everyone that needed some repeating pattern could just get that pattern. 
Would this be workable, or are there problems in multi-user setups?
Ah well, I'm not a kernel-hacker, but I just think this is the logical conclusion here.....
