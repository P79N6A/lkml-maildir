The /proc/cmdline part is easy.
Someone deleted the copy from saved_command_line to command_line.
Since kernel/params.c:parse_args called in init/main.c is destructive
if we don't do this we will never see a reasonable command line in /proc,
and /init implementations that parse /proc/command_line will choke horribly.
