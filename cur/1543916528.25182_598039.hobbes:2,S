I think I looked at that, and it wasn't as easy as it looked, because there
were ugly corner cases for what __builtin_return_address() returned depending
on exactly what did or didn't get inlined. Basically, it's ugly stuff - if you
try to use __builtin_retur_address inside kcalloc to pass to __kmalloc, and
then kcalloc gets inlined, you end up passing not the routine you wanted (the
caller of kcalloc), but the *parent* of that...
