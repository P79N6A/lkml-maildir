Please try.

That's no use to someone who is trying to understand this patch.

A revert patch's changelog should explain why the code is being reverted. 
ie: what was wrong with it.
A bugfix patch's changelog should explain the problem which is being
solved, and how it solves it.
Look at it from the point of view of someone who isn't intimately involved
in that subsystem and who isn't following every email on whatever mailing
list.  Your changelog des not provide sufficient detail for such a person
to understand your patch.
