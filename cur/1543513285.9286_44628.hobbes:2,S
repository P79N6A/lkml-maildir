I can't imagine why. That's like deciding to rewrite the kernel so it
doesn't require GCC to build. AS86 was just a TOOL! We try to use the
appropriate tool for various purposes when the need arises. The
appropriate tool to assemble Intel mnemonics is one that understands
Intel. GAS does not. GAS doesn't even know the way Intel assembly
should be written, i.e., destination operand first.
