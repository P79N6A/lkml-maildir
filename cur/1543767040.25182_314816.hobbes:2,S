Agreed.

Ok, fair enough -- as long as there's a way to immediately grant NL
requests, I'm happy :)

Yes, I believe LOCAL would always have to at least add a directory entry.
For the OCFS2 dlm which does not use a resource directory, the entry would
just exist on the creating node and other nodes would discover it later via
query.

I assume then that you can do that without racing the node who sent the
LOCAL request and another node who comes in (just afterwards) for a master
lookup? I bet the answer to that question would come to me if I read more of
the code :)
