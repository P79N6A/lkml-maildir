You can't - you need to make sure either the cards are different and check
the SCSI host probe order, or the detection order in the PCI bus.  You
should only need to do this once, and simply use the order you get.

If you are using ext2 filesystems, you don't care which is which, because
you can mount by filesystem UUID or LABEL, so just ignore the device names.
The same is true with LVM.
