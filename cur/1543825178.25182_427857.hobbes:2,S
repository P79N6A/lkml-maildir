Seems easy enough.... doesn't work for me :-(
Further exploration shows that I need font-lock mode enabled for it to
highlight speeling errors for me, and I never could get used to seeing
my C code look like a Disco.
It seems that flyspell-prog-mode absolutely requires font-lock as it
uses the font-lock tags to detect which text to spell check.
So I guess I need to tell font-lock that all the different text types
should be displayed in the same font.
Why is it never easy?
Thanks.
