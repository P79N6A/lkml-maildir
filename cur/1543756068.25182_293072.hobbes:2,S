ACK.  Moreover, dynamic registration of *majors* makes very little sense
these days - about as much as setting lower limit on IP block registration
to /12.
IMO we should put a large part of device number space for dynamic allocations
(current static ones barely scratch the surface - we could easily leave
upper half and nobody'd noticed) and use e.g. buddy allocator within it.
With allocation requests taking size of area as argument (rounded up to
power of 2, which it normally would be anyway).
Any objections to that?  Hell, we can even have register_blkdev() without
a fixed major calling blkdev_allocate(name, 1<<20) and then eliminate the
callers in favour of saner-sized requests.  Then kill register_blkdev()
completely...
