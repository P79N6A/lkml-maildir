This makes sense, I think.

For a system-wide profiler, this needs to be /all/ dentries that get
mapped in with executable permissions, or we lose any mappings of shared
libraries we don't know about etc. Essentially, oprofile wants samples
against any dentry that gets mmap()ed with PROT_EXEC, so this marking
would really need to happen at mmap() time. Missing out on any dentry
profiles amounts to data loss in the system profile and has the
potential to mislead.

oprofile currently receives eip-pid pairs, along with the necessary
syscall tracing info needed to reconstruct file offsets. The above
scheme removes the dependency on the pid, but this also unfortunately
throws away some useful information.
It is often useful to be able to separate out shared-library samples on
a per-process (and/or per-application) basis. Any really useful profile
buffer facility really needs to preserve this info, but just including
the raw pid isn't going to work when user-space can't reconstruct the
"name" of the pid (where "name" would be something "/bin/bash") because
the process exited in the meantime.
The same goes for kernel samples that happen in process context.
So this might work well in tandem with some global process-tree tracing
scheme, but I don't know what form that might take ...
(Then there are kernel modules, but that's probably best served by
patching modutils)
