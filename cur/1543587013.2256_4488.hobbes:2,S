As I already answered on VMware newsgroups:
VMware's 2.0.3 vmmon module uses save_flags() + cli()
in poll() fops, and after this cli() it calls
spin_lock() :-( It is not safest thing to do.
But it should not cause reboot. You should get
/dev/vmmon: 11 wait for global VM lock XX
and now dead machine with disabled interrupts...
As all other callers of HostIF_GlobalVMLock() hold
big kernel lock, easiest thing to do is to add
lock_kernel()/unlock_kernel() around LinuxDriver_Poll()
body.
Removing whole save_flags/cli is for sure much better,
but it is still in my queue (if you are looking into vmmon
driver, then whole poll mess is there to get wakeup on 
next jiffy, and not on next + one...).
