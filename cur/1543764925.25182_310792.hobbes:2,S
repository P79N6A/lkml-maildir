Sure, I suppose you can, but most suspend tools just
echo stuff to /sys (or still /proc/acpi/sleep) which
makes it harder to script it. Besides, when a laptop
goes into suspend to RAM there should be no extra
power   on except a Moon or some other icon.
That said, the ACPI thinkpad extras was designed to do
all of this so why shouldn't the driver do S3 suspend
if it hooks into it already?
