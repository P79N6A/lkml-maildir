No. It's true ONLY if you are using "normal" TCP/IP unterface. If you are
using "raw sockets" you can send ANY packets (even non-IP ones). That's the
point. HDIO_DRIVE_CMD gives you the same "raw I/O" ability. In both cases
you MUST be root to use it. So what's the difference ? Why we are not adding
such sanity checks in network stack ? Since we know that stupid IDE drive
can be hurt by wrong packet and smart network card can not ? Then fix stupid
IDE drive and make it smart as well.
