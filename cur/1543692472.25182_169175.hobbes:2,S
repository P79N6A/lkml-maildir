Yup! I'm running 2.6.0-test6-mm1 with synaptics-reconnect, serio-reconnect
and call_usermodehlper-retval-fix reverted, and no more zombies. It was the
call_usermodehelper reversion that fixed it. I looked at the patch and it
appears to mess with SIGCHLD signal handling and the kernel stack. How would
that mess up hotplug and the events/0 kernel thread?

Yes it does ;-)
On both 2.6.0-test6, 2.6.0-test6-mm1 full and 2.6.0-test6-mm1 minus the three
patches I mentioned above, the touchpad does work (at least it moves the cursor
and clicks).
