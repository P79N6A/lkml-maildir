This looks good.

The fec.c and fec_mii.c drivers used a shift by 4 to chop off the end  
of the ID.  When the PHY Layer switched to using a mask, not all of  
the drivers got properly switched.

The fec-style drivers do this:
         if(phy_info[i]->id == (fep->phy_id >> 4))
Anyway, your patch is correct.
