Also interesting is the following URL (was on /.) about HP's Dynamo:
http://www.arstechnica.com/reviews/1q00/dynamo/dynamo-1.html
In short, the article claims that a virtualized CPU is/can be faster than 
a "normal" CPU. Would be cool: Define a "Linux userspace instruction set"
and let the kernel optimize it to the processor-of-the-day.
