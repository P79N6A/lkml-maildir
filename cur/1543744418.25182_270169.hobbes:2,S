Because my solution works fine with userspace partitioning code (I tested
with partx from util-linux) and has the big advantage that partitions
actually appear at the right place in /sys/block/loopN/loopNpM. Most
other solutions for many partitions per device failed to make the
relationship between parent device and partition visible in sysfs.
I haven't checked yet how EVMS handles this. Could you post
find /sys/block/$SOME_EVMS_DISK/ -type d
for a normal disk which is completely managed by EVMS so I can verify
whether that would be satisfactory. Thanks.
