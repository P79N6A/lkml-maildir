	That thing depends mostly on filesystem internal data layouts.
	EXT2 has 16-bits unsigned at the disk.  So has Solaris UFS..
	Most filesystems seem to have 16 bit count limit, or 8-bit..
	(some signed, others unsigned)  (minix: 8bit).
	Some filesystems don't (at i-nodes) seem to support links at all
	(or there are no i-nodes.)
	In theory nothing prevents you from cooking up your own FS which
	has different on-disk layout (or reuse some unused fields), and
	support that. (Compare how 64-bit filesizes are encoded to EXT2.)
	Call it something else that e.g. EXT2, say: EXT2RC
	Remember to tweak/create FSCK tool for it, too.
	Hmm... Of course a bit troublesome is that 'stat()' structure has
	only 16-bit field for link count...
