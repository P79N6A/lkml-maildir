No, it isn't documented.  It says that the *work* callback may be running, but
does not mention the timer callback.  However, just looking at the
cancellation function source made it clear that this would wait for the timer
handler to return first.
However, is it worth just making cancel_delayed_work() a void function and not
returning anything?  I'm not sure the return value is very useful.
