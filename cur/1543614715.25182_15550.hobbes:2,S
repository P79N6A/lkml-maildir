If your tecra is one with the problem early intel PCI chipsets the
documentation on the workaround is on the intel.com site if you feel
creative 8)
Basically the A20 handling for hardware caches on some of these early chips
was broken. There were real hardware fixes for new boards and a software
workaround for old ones is described in the errata docs for the chip.
