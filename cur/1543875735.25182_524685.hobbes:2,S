But IIRC, that was without my patch? Wouldn't per-subsystem
multithreaded probing just expose bugs that could also be exposed on
SMP systems?

The css/ccw busses may profit from it, since we tend to have thousands
of devices there. OTOH, we've already tried to make probing as
asynchronous as possible, so maybe there isn't that much gain. I'd need
to do some measurements (when I find some time...)
