Hello,
I have a problem with mmaping memory to userspace.
It´s very simple:
addr = __get_free_pages(GFP_KERNEL,0);
int atoll_fops_mmap(struct file *filp, struct vm_area_struct *vma)
{
        vma->vm_flags |= VM_SHM | VM_LOCKED | VM_IO;
	
	if(remap_page_range_A(vma,
		vma->vm_start, addr, 4096,
		vma->vm_page_prot)) {
			printk("remapping send space failed\n");
			return -ENXIO;
	}
        *(unsigned long *)addr = 0x23;
        printk("mmap finished, first bytes: %lx\n",*(unsigned long *)addr);
	return 0;
}
int atoll_fops_release(struct inode *inode,struct file *filp)
{
	printk("release, first bytes: %lx\n",*(unsigned long *)addr);
	return 0;
}
complete code is here:
http://debian.christian-leber.de/mmap_problem/atollinit.txt
or as tar
http://debian.christian-leber.de/mmap_problem.tar.bz2
The stupid little testprogramm:
 ptr=mmap(NULL,4096,PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE,MAP_SHARED,fdopen,0);
 if(ptr==-1) printf("ERROR\n");
 *(ptr) = 0x42;
 printf("%lx\n",*(ptr));
This works as expected with 2.6.3 on IA64
Testprogramm gives out "42"
and in the kernel log:
mmap finished, first bytes: 23
release, first bytes: 42
Now it gets odd:
On a Dual PIII; another one; dual xeon; another one; and a P3 laptop
The testprogramm gives out "ffffffff"
In the kernel log:
mmap finished, first bytes: 23
release, first bytes: 23
So never anything is written to memory.
(it also doesn´t depend on the kernel, i tried several
versions/configurations)
On a Duron (also tried with exact the same kernel from one of the
systems above), the Testprogramm gives correct output, but the kernel
log says:
mmap finished, first bytes: 23
release, first bytes: 23
So also nothing is actually written to the memory.
Is that a bug (can´t imagine) or do I do a really stupid error?
