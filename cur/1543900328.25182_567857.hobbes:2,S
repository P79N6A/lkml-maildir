Indeed, it seems that these files, in the kernel tree I used with the 
2.6.22 patch, where modified in the past (a diff of 
include/linux/dvb/audio.h between my tree and a fresh tree clearly 
showed the problem).
I replaced my tree with a fresh 2.6.22 tree and it now compiles without 
any problems.
