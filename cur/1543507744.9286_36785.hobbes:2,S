Yes, I've not applied that - sorry.

Already done.

The other two conflicts were with Alan's 2.2.13-pre1 patch, now that I
look closer:

Even after fixing these, lockd goes down with an Ooops on the first lock
attempt.  I'll try backing out the standalone lockd patch and see if that
mitigates the problem.  I'm not really set on using this feature, but HJ's
init scripts assume its presence, so it seemed easier to just apply it.
