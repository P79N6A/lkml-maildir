hm, cannot find it - there's been too many other bugs in that timeframe so 
i'd have to try a dozen configs to find out which one it was.
It's not a big problem i think: i'd suggest you fix the problem pinpointed 
by the build error i sent to you - and if anything else happens with newer 
patches i'll send you a full config for those problems. This area is thick 
include file spaghetti that will need a few iterations to sort out.
