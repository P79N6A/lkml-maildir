What do you mean by "blown format" ?
I you eject a floppy during read on amiga , just just get a "Put it back
in !"
message , and when you put in back in , it continues with read and
nothing bad
happens.
For writing it is a little bit worse , becasue amigaOS just overwrites (
AFAIK )
the entire track ,so some older sectors might be lost, but this isn't
the case
on wintel PCs, because they operate sector-wise , so it shouldn't be a
problem.
The kernel just retries the failed sector and everything is OK.
Anyway, if the floppy is ejected when no R/W operation is in progress,
then there
is _absolutely_ no problem. User puts the floppy back on request and the
world is saved !
And dont come with that "Where should be the request displayed" cr*p !
If you have no better idea, display it on the console !
Or just display not message , but start blinking the drive LED and move
the
head like crazy , right after the in-use floppy is removed. That should
get the (l)user's attention :-)
And also remember , that this problem CAN and already HAS BEEN solved. (
but in linux - yet )
It is just a question of writing some code.
