And Plan 9 didn't become "commercially available" until *after* development
was stopped, IIRC.
Moreover, it's still very early in its life cycle compared to Unix.  It's
still at about the same stage as 6th Research Edition Unix was --- so it's a
bit premature to call it a failure.  All it would really take would be for
some analog of UCB-CSRG to pick it up....
