It becomes a hardware issue at higher cpu counts. Commodity hardware is 
not designed to handle these high processor counts thus workarounds like 
listed above become necessary. Our 512 processor systems have been running 
with 1024 HZ for a long time. Plus you really need a good filesystem 
(XFS).
