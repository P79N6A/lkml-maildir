You forgot to mention that some people are not allowed to use bk (without 
paying) and some people also don't like the invasion of privacy (unless 
they pay).

This has never been an issue, the complete version history is only 
available to bk users. This makes it difficult for other SCM developers to 
assist users in easy exchange of information with bk users or converting 
their information from bk into other formats.

a product.
