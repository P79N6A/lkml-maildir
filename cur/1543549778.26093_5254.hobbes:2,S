Which is completely wrong if the program uses _any not completely_
unusual locality of reference.  Think twice about that, it is more
probable that you need more that 300MB of filesystem cache that you
have an aplication that references _randomly_ 1.5GB of data.  You need
to balance that _always_ :((((((
I think that there is no silver bullet here :(
Later, Juan.
