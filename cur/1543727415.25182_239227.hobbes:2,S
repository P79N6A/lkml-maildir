Its mostly been discussed on vendor-sec so far. Paul was gracious enough
to give everyone time to work on the problem. Al Viro did some original
patches, various folks then moved them to 2.6 and fixed other stuff from
further review.
Andrew has 2.6 draft patches, Marcelo actively worked on the 2.4 ones
(and some 2.6 glitches). If you need 2.6 patches "right now" then one
place to grab them is from the current Fedora 2 kernel.
