I already know how to write this.
The problem is not for _me_, it is for all these people that use
init=/bin/sh, and wonder why ^C doesn't work. Finding documentation on
such issue is not easy, so they'll most probably _not_ find out that
they need to use /sbin/sulogin, /bin/login, or even dig the linux-kernel
archives for your program. That's why I'm raising the issue at the
kernel level.
