The i_sem to i_mutex change started in the 2.6.16 series.
Running against 2.6.15 would be interesting. Being able
to repeat every time is a plus. I'm not that familiar
with the sysfs stuff, but the slab poisoning is pretty
damning. The dentry was released and then accessed.
I looked at cdc_acm for disconnect and close and
did not see any problems (such as trying to call
tty_unregister_device twice for a device).
