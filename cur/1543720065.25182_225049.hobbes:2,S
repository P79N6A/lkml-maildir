I think that kernel cannot know that you need some data once or more.
This is fadvise for.
With my wrapper (
http://kernel.umbrella.ro
) for fadvise you can do this:
NOCA_SIZE=128 NOCA_READ=1 NOCA_WRITE=1 NOCA_RA=1 \
 	noca mkisofs -R -o /tmp/1.iso /tmp/data
This means:
NOCA_SIZE: Call fadvise only after 128KiB was read/wrote.
NOCA_RA: call fadvise with POSIX_FADV_SEQUENTIAL
NOCA_READ: use fadvise(POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED) for reads (because you don't 
need anymore the source files)
NOCA_WRITE: use fadvise(POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED) for writes (because it's 
useless to cache the end of the ISO)
Do this program resolve your problem?
