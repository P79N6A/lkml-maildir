It is a bit of a hack, but the theory behind it is fairly simple.  It came
out of my early efforts to sort the list. Martin and I produced a theory
that many vmas have identical start and end addresses due to fork and/or
fixed address mappings.  If this theory is true list-of-lists will create a
much shorter top-level list of unique start-end pairs for searching.  We'd
only need to walk the second level list when we get a match to the search.
It never got any serious exposure or testing.  It came out just as
everyone's attention shifted away from objrmap so no one really looked at
it.
