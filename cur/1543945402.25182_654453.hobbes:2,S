The dmactl read back should be just fine, or any other DMA register (eg
status).

Agreed - we know some controllers crap themselves spectacularly on
anything which causes a SATA data transfer to be needed during a reset so
the status is probably safest. The fact its not fixed is because nobody
has sat down to figure out what is safe.

Easier to add that to the ioxxxx ops I suspect (ioispio/ioismmio say) ?
