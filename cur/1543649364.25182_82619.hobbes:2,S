Those were real world requirements - we got the number 10,000 from our 
product management, which (presumably) spoke with customers.  On the 
hosting systems, it is really possible to have thousands of virtual sites.
Now, I don't much care if you want it to be a linear search, and I'll 
revert it, if needed, but qsort() is already in in XFS specific code, 
and bsearch is small.  It doesn't negatively impact any fast path, and 
provides better behavior for the crazies that really want 10,000 groups.
