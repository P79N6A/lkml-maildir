OK.  I'll have to look at this more closely.  I simply ran across this as a
substantial change between this and earlier kernels and decided to test
against the original file_free()->kmem_cache_free() code to ensure that that
alone was indeed the issue (for the circumstance I'll describe below).

No, but here's the circumstance under which I notice this:
I'm running on a single cpu of an SMP system (4 cpu).  When I hit this I'm in
a situation where I've written some file data, and am now sleeping waiting to
be woken up.  No other threads are running on that cpu other than a few kernel
threads, so all is fairly quiet.
By the simple one line change (file_free() calling kmem_cache_free() again),
I'm always woken up very quickly.   Too bad we cannot revert back that way
with the rcu changes.

I'll look at this as soon as I get a chance.
