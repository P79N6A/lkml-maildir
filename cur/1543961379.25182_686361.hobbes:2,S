OK probably I didn't understand your policy. I ever thought that the host controller should know, when the clock should be off.
The PXA controller is different and it was the simples (but effective) way to solve this difference.
So, I hope it will be usable for people which has problem with "always on" clock, until you solve it in different way (if you going to do this).
Thanks
