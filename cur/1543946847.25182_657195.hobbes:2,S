Exactly.

Yeah, in the hibernate case this is definitely true.

Really, in the simple s3 case we still need early/late stuff?

Well, it seems like we'll have to fix drivers in either case, and isn't a 
kexec approach fundamentally more sound and simple, design-wise?  Rafael 
pointed out some problems with properly setting wakeup states, but I think 
that could be overcome...

Yeah, definitely.  It has to be much more robust and deal with configuration 
changes, etc. (within reason).
