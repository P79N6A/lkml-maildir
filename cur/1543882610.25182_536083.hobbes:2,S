"no regressions" is definitely not feasible.
14 known regressions, some of them not yet debugged at all, are 
different from your "some small regression".
And look e.g. at the many (and non-trivial) changes between -rc7 and 
-final, resulting in more than one report from people who were running 
-rc7 without problems - and 2.6.21 doesn't work for them.
It's not a choice between "regressions don't matter" and "no regressions",
it's about the place in the area between these two extremes. I have my 
opinions on what I want to expect from a stable Linux kernel, and other 
people have different opinins.
