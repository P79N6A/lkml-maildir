On which versions?  There have been a few reports of this starting
between 2.2.13 and 2.2.14: can you check if 2.2.13 is working OK for
you?

That should be safe enough.

The page data should at least be sector-aligned in memory: the whole IO
request layer is simply not tested on any other alignment.  It shouldn't
have to be page-aligned at all.
