Doesn't fix the problem, and here is the debug:
TSC calibrated against pm_timer 8927439 9106459 179020 640810145
tsckhz: 135069550000000000 640810145 210779356
Marking TSC unstable due to TSCs unsynchronized
time.c: Detected 210779.356 MHz processor.
(Perhaps if this debug effort has to continue, we could remove some of these 
gentlemen from CC?)
