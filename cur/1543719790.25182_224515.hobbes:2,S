Okay, i've looked at it, but i don't think i could simply use less 
space, because (if i understand the I2O spec right :-D) the controller 
returns me a address inside this window, where i could write the I2O 
message. So i ask the controller, where do you want my request, then he 
tells me a address...
If i only ioremap 64MB, and the controller tells me write at 80MB, i'm 
in deep trouble :-D

Yep, thanks, but a patch for this is already send :-)
