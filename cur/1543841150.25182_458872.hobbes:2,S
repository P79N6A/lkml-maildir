Hi,
In my driver (Process context), I have written the following code:
--------------------------------------------
spin_lock(lock)
...
//Critical section to manipulate driver data
...
spin_u lock(lock)
---------------------------------------------
I have written similar code in my interrupt handler (Interrupt
context). The driver data is not accessed from anywhere else. Is my
code safe from any potential concurrency issues? Is there a need to
use spin_lock_irqsave()? In both the places?
I intend to run the driver on SMP machine.
Regards,
Rick
