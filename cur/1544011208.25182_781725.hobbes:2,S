Thank you for sending this to me -- this server has not been up for
very long so we are working the kinks out and i am very busy at work
as well -- i am finishing up a script to automate the updating of the
repo so that nothing gets missed -- this should be fully operational
by the weekend i'm hoping
Thanks!
