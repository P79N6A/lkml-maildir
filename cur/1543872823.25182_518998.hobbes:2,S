And I didn't see it for the few hours I was booted to 21-rc3-rsdl-0.29, 
but tar sure went berzackers.
To Con, I knew 2.6.20 worked with your earlier patches, so rather than 
revert all the way, I just rebooted to 2.6.20.2-rdsl-0.30 and I'm going 
to fire off another backup.  I suspect it will work, but will advise the 
next time I wake up.
