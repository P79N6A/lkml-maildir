Canonical example is access(2) followed by open(2), not really relevant
in this case.  However, exec setuid root app...when do you check, and
when to you fill in data to send back to user?  For /proc, this type of
check happens often (see things like may_ptrace_attach and
task_dumpable in fs/proc/base.c).
