Well, by "available" you probably mean "not available", because it doesn't 
actually work.
I get EPERM on pack-e00affefe0f779d0f9b0507aef25a1733f4a9117.idx/pack, 
because they are
	-r-------- 1 junio junio  1120880
	-r-------- 1 junio junio 15709370
respectively.
As a result, nothing really works, ie:
	[torvalds@hera git.git]$ git log
	error: Could not read 42c4b58059fa9af65e90f2c418bb551e30d1d32f
and doing a "git pull" will just result in lots of
	error: refs/heads/maint does not point to a valid object!
	error: refs/heads/next does not point to a valid object!
	error: refs/heads/todo does not point to a valid object!
	...
which is perhaps a bit of a misleading error message (technically true, 
but ..)
Oops.
