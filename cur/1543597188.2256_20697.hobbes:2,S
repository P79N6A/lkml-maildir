2.2 merely ignores APIC errors.  that doesn't mean they don't happen...

naughty, naughty.  
I've never known any dual FSB100-overclocked celeron machine to run stably.
> APIC error on CPU0: 00(08)
read as "apic hardware detected a corrupt inter-processor message
and automatically retried it".  unfortunately, the checksum is weak,
so with even a modest stream of such errors, there will be uncaught ones.
also, this covered in the kernel FAQ.
