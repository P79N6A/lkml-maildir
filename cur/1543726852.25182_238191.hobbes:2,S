I just posted what I hope is a final patch for this one.  We'll see what

It should probably be a real device driver rather than a sysfs pseudofile.  
Not sure if it should be dynamic or not though.  It would be nice if apps 
used the driver to do legacy VGA I/O port accesses as well, since that would 
make things easier on platforms that unconditionally master abort when a PIO 
times out, and would probably make it easier to deal with multiple domains.
