That looks like an excessively complicated workaround. Why not just
$(obj)/sm_tbl_%: $(obj)/gentbl
	$(obj)/gentbl
?
I'm not sure this is really a bug either. It is a Good Thing that make
tries to normalize the names of targets and dependencies internally,
lest the build may be incomplete or redundant if make does not realize
that foo.bar and ./foo.bar is the same file. It is quite reasonable
for $< to unfold to the *canonical* name of the file in question, I
think.
If one absolutely wants the command to use the exact form of the
dependency that's used in the dependency list, it's easy to simply
reproduce that form, replacing the % by $*
