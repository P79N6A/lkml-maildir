I can confirm that it takes ages to complete without the sched_yield. (2.6.11-gentoo). With sched_yield it's very fast.
Funny thing is that strace'ing the running process (without sched_yield) makes it run very fast. 
I tried to oprofile it but no kernel or process stats changed due to the process run. (It might be doing nothing at all..)
