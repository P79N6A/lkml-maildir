Some comments about this :
1) not optimal placement on 64bits arches (it creates one hole before 
i_mmap_writeable)
2) sizeof(struct address_space) is an issue, given it is included in every 
inode, even sockets or pipes.
-> 2.1) Do we really need 32 bits for 'order' and 'shift'
-> 2.2) Do we really need a 64bits offset_mask since it's a trivial arithmetic 
from 'shift' (or 'order') ?
BTW, I presume splice() is not yet supported ? If yes, each pipe could hold 16 
  'big pages' so we probably can hit some DOS condition sooner...
