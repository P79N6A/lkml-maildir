Aehm, Daniel. Just for a hint of what I know about C:
IF age is unsigned long (like declared above) and PAGE_AGE_DECL is a define,
then age-PAGE_AGE_DECL is of type unsigned long, which means it will not go
below 0 but instead be huge positive, so your cast (int) before will not do any
good, and you will not end up with 0 but somewhere above the clouds.
So you just made Linus' max/min/cast point of view _very_ clear, I guess it was
something like "people don't really think about using max/min and related
problems".
;-))
I guess you meant:
page->age = max(((int)age - (int)PAGE_AGE_DECL),0);
Written without actually caring about the real definition of PAGE_AGE_DECL.
Regards,
Stephan
PS: please anyone don't tell me what gnu c actually thinks about this, I don't
care, I read K&R.
And, of course, the whole thing is not worth discussing, it just hit me ...
