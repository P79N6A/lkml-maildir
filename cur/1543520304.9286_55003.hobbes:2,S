This may be tacky... but how about connector corrosion? Since it seems to be
fixed by 1) terminator replacement or 2) replacing cable or 3) controller
replacement. A contact cleaner may help...
I think the buslogic controllers have a better connector and stronger drivers
(more expensive too). The stronger drivers may be able to push through the
corrosion longer before problems occur.
My BT948 controller has only given problems with an external DAT drive which
I fixed by unplugging and replugging. None of the internal disks have ever
given me a problem. (2 on a BT948, one on a BT958)
