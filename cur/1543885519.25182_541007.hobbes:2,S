There are some fields in percpu section which are accessed by other
cpu's but not cache line aligned, e.g. cpu_idle_state, flush_state in
x86-64. We don't want to place those fields into same subsection as
cacheline aligned fields.
So perhaps, I can change the section name
.data.percpu.cacheline_aligned_in_smp to
.data.percpu.shared_cacheline_aligned. And change macro
DEFINE_PER_CPU_CACHELINE_ALIGNED_IN_SMP to
DEFINE_PER_CPU_SHARED_CACHELINE_ALIGNED.
.data.percpu.shared_cacheline_aligned contains only cpu shared percpu
fields which are cacheline aligned. In future (or in a separate patch
series), we can define another percpu section .data.percpu.shared and
its macro DEFINE_PER_CPU_SHARED_CACHELINE_ALIGNED which store all of cpu
shared percpu fields. The new .data.percpu.shared and
DEFINE_PER_CPU_SHARED_CACHELINE_ALIGNED are for better coding and
understanding.
Thanks.
