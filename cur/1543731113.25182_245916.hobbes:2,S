Well, the kernel doesn't have a filesystem that speaks http, scp and
those things. GnomeVFS is URL-based. It has some pseudo-protocols that
extract a pseudo directory-tree for all installed applications + the
changes the used made, created on the fly from a set of XML files that
are read-only and system-wide and the user-overridden changes. I don't
know if all of these things would really make sense inside the kernel.
