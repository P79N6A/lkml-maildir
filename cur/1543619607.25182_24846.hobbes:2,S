I did get tons of warnings when compiling (I would assume everyone else
did).  But I ignored those since it says "this is obsolete"
After booting, I had so many ECC errors (I don't recall if they were
correctable or not) that I had to give up on it.
Unless debian messedup the 3.0.3 compile it didn't work for me.
