Hello,
  I would like to know a command line ftp command
through which i can ftp to my server with
TLS/SSL(explicit)  support. I had tried sftp, it does
not work and people say it has SSL support and not TLS
support. I did try lftp, but could not make it work.
Can some one tell me the exact way to get lftp work or
some other ftp command to work with TLS/SSL (explicit)
.
1)I dont want (SFTP over SSH2), (FTP over TLS/SSL
implicit) 
2)I am able to connect with kftpgrabber. But i would
like to connect through command line.  
Thankyou
Deepan Chakravarthy
