Precisely. I have to maintain separate #ifdefs of code that parses
/proc/cpuinfo for each architecture that Linux runs on. Using sysctl()
would be much more architecture independent thus I can write code once
compile on many.
I've changed my mind and removed Jes Sorenson from my kill-filter, he
might have something interesting to say... 
Cheers,
