if you use my patch "kmsgdump", you'll be able to dump
all your kernel messages present in the syslog buffer
(16kB, reconfigurable up to about 60 kb) onto a
diskette, a printer and/or a scrolling text window
without risking your disks damaged.
you can get it from :

I wonder if it wouldn't be interesting to include it
in ac-patches (Alan's "plus pack"^TM) for 2.2.13.
