Subject: [patch] mpol_free_shared_poliy() is not called for non-inline symlink under tmpfs

Hi,
If the inode is non-inline symbolic link under tmpfs,
shmem_destroy_inode() always skips to call mpol_free_shared_policy().
However the policy field of non-inline symbolic link inode is intact and
I think it is better to be freed by mpol_free_shared_policy().
I'm not sure this actually causes any serious problem, but
the following patch fixes it anyway.
