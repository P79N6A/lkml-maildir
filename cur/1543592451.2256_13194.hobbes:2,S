This cannot possibly fix the problem because this code is
never reached.
What was observed in the backtraces by arjan, ben, marcelo
and people at IBM was:
create_buffers -> get_unused_buffer_head -> __alloc_pages
with the system looping infinitely in __alloc_pages. The
code you are changing above ONLY gets reached in case the
__alloc_pages (and thus, get_unused_buffer_head) returns
failure.
