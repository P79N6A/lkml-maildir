It seems fair. David, what's your opinion ?

It would really depend on the on-disk format. If the partition table really
stores 32 bit ints for sector counts, there's no point switching from ints
to longs. But if it already stores 64 bits, then we're limiting it to 2 TB
with 32 bit ints. I haven't checked the code right now, so I don't know. I
hope Davem will enlighten us on this matter.
