Yes, none of the above appear to be atomic contexts. GFP_KERNEL in
that case would've been a bug. If they were atomic contexts, someone
somewhere would've been seeing a lot of "BUG: sleeping function called
from invalid context" messages and would've probably brought it to
lkml's notice already ;-) So the GFP_ATOMIC seems to be redundant
thing here in both cases.
