I haven't looked at the details so I can't comment much there, though
the hook has the interest of making it possible to have it in a module
that gets separately loaded if necessary, no ? Maybe the driver could
maintain a list of hooks ?

While I understand your feeling, it's a bit annoying in this specific
case because previous models did this in hardware and all mac keymaps
already account for that. Knowing how nasty it has been to get mac
keymaps updated and in a good shape, and to get distros to properly get
them, it makes a lot of sense to have this small hook in the kernel that
makes the USB keyboard behave exactly like the older ADB couterparts.
