ADC probably meant "large page tables" as opposed to "large pages".
Instead of one page table entry per 4K page, Pentium supports PTEs for
contiguous collections of pages, less activity on the page tables
generally results in better performance.

Statistics say that the average loss will be 1/2 page per module.  Some
will waste more, some will waste less, average is 1/2 the unit.
