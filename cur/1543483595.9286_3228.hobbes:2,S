There was a fix to the CDROM driver in 2.0.36 that probably didn't make it
into 2.2.1 or doesn't work quite right.
In your 2.0.36 trace, the messages 
Mar  9 16:42:52 tantalus kernel: hdc: no response (status = 0xd0),
resetting drive
Mar  9 16:42:52 tantalus kernel: hdc: ACER CD-787E/JAS, ATAPI CDROM
drive
indicate that after the first probe failed, an ATAPI reset was issued on the
IDE channel, and then the drive could be found.
The latest IDE/CDROM driver must have omitted this fix.
