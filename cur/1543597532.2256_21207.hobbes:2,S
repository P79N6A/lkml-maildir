Running the XFree86 config program from XFree86-xf86cfg-4.0.3-5.i386.rpm
(RedHat 7.1) _causes_ the massive clock skew on my Tyan Tomcat IV (i430HX)
Pentium 233/MMX motherboard w/ S3 Virge.  My 2.2.19 kernel prints the
"clock skew detected -- probably a VIA 686a" message and resets the clock.
The NTP daemon afterward can't correct the clock fast enough if the kernel
doesn't fix it.  I can tell when it happens because the GPM mouse cursor
moves very jerky. If I don't run that program, no clock skew ever.
XFree86 4.0 is fine otherwise but since I can't screenshot with my BTTV
card, I run 3.3.6.
So maybe not always hardware, sometimes just suid apps stomping on what
they shouldn't.
