I applied the patches provided by Jens Axboe to resolve disk hang
after S3 resume.
Now I have a strange S3 resume (2.6.11.11 kernel) problem with sata
device on my thinkpad.  If i resume within 1 minute after I suspend
everything works fine. But, if I resume after a couple of minutes, I
get the following error
ATA: abnormal status 0x80 on port 0x1F7
ATA: abnormal status 0x80 on port 0x1F7
ATA: abnormal status 0x80 on port 0x1F7
Nothing works after this..I have to manually powercycle the laptop.
Thx
