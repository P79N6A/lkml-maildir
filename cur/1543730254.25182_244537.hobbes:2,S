Strangely, it doesn't seem to affect his credibility at all. Yours, OTOH...

Current Sun Enterprise. Typically several CPUs, several GiB RAM, connected
via fiber to TiB storage array.

The one for the above machines. Duh...

Millions of machines vs a few tens of thousands?

Palm Pilot V or thereabouts.

Add that, and a lot of other similarly small random junk, and we are soon
talking serious MiBs... Larry McVoy has made it very clear here that
Slowlaris got that bloated way one tiny, unnoticeable, not too relevant
feature at a time.
