Hi,
I am just wondering how to enable write back caching with libata.
dmesg gives me
SCSI device sda: drive cache: write through
I would like to use the drive's wirte caching feature to improve 
performance /I know it is a bit dangerous with a flaky system).
Could anyeone tell me how to do it?
Thanks,
Prakash
