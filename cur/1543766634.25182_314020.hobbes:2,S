Ok, after a bit more thinking, I think I'll go that way for now, please
let me know if you think I'm wrong:
rename "resource" to "resources" and make it contain a start address
that matches the BAR value, that is something that has at least some
sort of meaning in userland and can be passed to pci_mmap_page_range().
To do that "translation", I'll read the BAR value, and use it as start,
then use the resource size & flags.
The name change will also allow userland to "detect" the fixed
implementation.
Ben.
