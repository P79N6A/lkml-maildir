Actually, I specified __get_free_pages(1) 80 times because I don't know if the 
card's SG can actually support 160 separate buffers (I'm certain it can do at 
least 80 though).
I grepped my 2.4 kernel source for 'vmap' and the only results that seemed 
meaningful were vmap_pte_range or vmap_pmd_range in mips/mm/umap.c and 
mips64/mm/umap.c. Is this documented somewhere? I suffer from the 'i'm new at 
this, but this looks possible' syndrome. I don't actually know how anything is 
accomplished.
Btw, am I right about kmalloc(35000) effectively grabbing 64K?
