Actually I think that is a very sensible solution to this problem.
It does double or triple the length of the string passed to lockd
and is an information leak about which kernel addresses you are
running out of which may be undesirable from a security perspective
but I think that will fix the practical problem.
Reference counting in this case is not an issue, as these are
per process locks and should be freed up when everything goes.
I have a weird memory that simply making the string long and using
%p (current) didn't work as well as of %d (current->kpid) but that is something
very hard to test, as usually even with multiple pid spaces you don't
get pid reuse and the errors from NFS are not at all clear that pid
reuse is what is causing problems.  So I don't have good data on
that situation.
