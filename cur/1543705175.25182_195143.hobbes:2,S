Hi.
I rearranged things earlier today. The latest patch versions are now all
under the 'current' sections at the top of
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=25964.
When I use -rev, I mean a revised version, just as you think, so I'd go
for
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/swsusp/software-suspend-linux-2.6.1-rev6-whole.bz2?download
and
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/swsusp/software-suspend-core-2.0-whole.bz2?download
and (as the instructions on 
http://swsusp.sf.net
 say), apply them in
that order.
Regards,
Nigel
