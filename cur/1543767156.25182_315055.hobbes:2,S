I really ended up deciding that we can fix it with a simple one-liner 
instead, which actually simplifies and cleans up the code, instead of 
adding new special cases.
I just committed the appended, which actually removes one line more than 
it adds.

    x86: make traps on 'iret' be debuggable in user space
    This makes a trap on the 'iret' that returns us to user space
    cause a nice clean SIGSEGV, instead of just a hard (and silent)
    exit.
    That way a debugger can actually try to see what happened, and
    we also properly notify everybody who might be interested about
    us being gone.
    This loses the error code, but tells the debugger what happened
    with ILL_BADSTK in the siginfo.
