The suggested patch adds manual padding to the acpi_device_id structure
definition in include/linux/mod_devicetable.h  I didn't take it, and it
appears that nobody else did either.  It is not in Linus' tree (as of 2.6.23-rc2).
I expressed doubts about whether this is the right fix.  The problem
is that when cross-compiling a locally compiled utility makes a size &
alignment check.  This is bogus.  We shouldn't care whether this structure
compiles to the same size/alignment as the kernel that will use on the
target platform.
Is fixing this the right way (make the scripts/mod/file2alias.c understand
target alignment rules in a cross environment) just too hideous to
contemplate ... and we should just sacrifice 7 bytes of padding in
order to keep life simple?
