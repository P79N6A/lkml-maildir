Maybe brute force is the best way to deal with this nasty one ? I'm thinking: 
It must be rather easy to make a tool that takes a .config file and an 
argument "This kernel seems in trouble Yes / No". If an option is enabled, 
and this kernel config crashes, you increase the likelihood of that option 
(i.e. you increment a counter). If an option is enabled, and this kernel 
doesn't crash. you decrement a counter. In the end, you'll end with 
statistics about which kernel option is likely to cause problems.
