I am wondering what we should do with this patch. The RCU stats display
the #s of RCU requests and actual updates on each CPU. On a normal system
they don't mean much to a sysadmin, so I am not sure if it is the right
thing to include this feature. OTOH, it is extremely useful to detect
potential memory leaks happening due to, say a CPU looping in
kernel (and RCU not happening consequently). Will a CONFIG_RCU_DEBUG
make it more palatable for mainline ?
Thanks
