It's been pointed out to me that this Doze-vs-Linux comparison won't help. If 
you're offended by it, please don't be. I've been a supporter and contributer 
to the GNU cause for the last six years and I'm not going to stop. However 
this is the first serious issue that I've come across re: the kernel and 
incompatible hardware and I would like to see it fixed. Like I've said, I 
want to help pinpoint the problem - but no-one's asking.
