Yes, indeed. Given that struct iattr already defines ATTR_FILE and ia_file, I 
didn't see a good reason to invent something new when we can just use the 
existing mechanism.

If that file is still part of the namespace (i.e., not deleted), then access 
to the file descriptor is revalidated against the new profile ("changing hat" 
is switching to a different profile). If the file has already been deleted, 
then access is granted. There isn't that much of a difference between a 
deleted file and say, and anonymous pipe: both can be used by processes to 
communicate, and both will cease their lives once no longer referenced.
Later with IPC mediation, we'll obviously have to control which profiles may 
communicate with which other profiles. One possibility for that would be to 
map profiles and allowed communication channels to labels and access rules.
