That shouldn't happen.

Aha. That's also strange. `ntpd` is able to (and always does AFAIK)
modify the speed of the clock (to keep it synchronized) so that the
error is usually much smaller than 1 second - also if you are behind
high-jitter links and/or an a high stratum.
That leads to the question why the clock starts to run like crazy at
some time so that `ntpd` can't cope with it.
Playing with `ntpd` parameters (e.g. increasing ) doesn't help I assume.
