so BK cannot be used to access the kernel tree in that case, correct? I'm
just wondering where the boundary line is. Eg. if i started working on a

keep stuff like that in mind when using BK.

in no way - but it would be a (small) incentive for them to open-source
their kernel mods. Which would also enable you to use the technology. Ie.  
potentially good for you.
