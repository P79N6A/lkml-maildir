Thanks.
Recent mm's have had some experimental fair request
allocation code in them which should be sorted now
(not yet in a released mm), and should improve
performance of "queue full" loads such as many
writers or readers.
It might not get the throughput of mainline kernels,
but I have seen 5x better max latency in some cases.
It would be interesting to see how it goes on a big
box.
Don't know whats going on with AIM7, but there have
been a few bugs in AS being fixed.
tiobench on SMP results are not very good, lots of
fragmentation, the random IO throughput drops is
probably due to AS strangling TCQ though. You are
using SMP and TCQ, right?
