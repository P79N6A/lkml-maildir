Thanks for pointing out the origin of the only-UID-matters sticky dir
semantics.  I failed to check the BSD 4.4 manuals.  Mea culpa.

o Having the sticky bit on a directory mean *anything* is non-portable.
  This is as good an argument against BSD 4.4 semantics as it is against
  SVr4 semantics.  To my knowledge, the sticky bit on a directory was first
  significant on SunOS 4.1.  Before that, it had no meaning at all.  No
  matter what semantics (including nothing), sticky dirs are not portable.
o It is precisely because of Linux's relative compatibility with POSIX,
  SVr4 and XPG that I use and professionally recommend Linux instead of
  BSD.  POSIX, SVr4 and XPG are the vendor-neutral published standards that
  the current commercial UNIXs try to implement.  This is a big selling
  point for anyone migrating from, or interoperating with, current
  commercial UNIX dialects like Solaris, HPUX, etc.  It is precisely
  because of BSD's relative indifference to SVr4, POSIX and XPG that I have
  never professionally recommended it.  This is also why compatibility with
  BSD, _by itself_, is of little value to me or most of my clients.  This
  is also why you'll see more commercial software ported to Linux than BSD
  even though BSD has been available a lot longer.
o If you compare money spent, numbers of CPUs, number of users, cumulative
  CPU power, etc., I'd bet SVr4 derivatives are a *lot* more common than
  BSD derivatives.  Even OSF ultimately adopted SVr4 "lite" as a base
  system.  If portability is the issue, go with SVr4 (and POSIX and XPG as
  applicable) semantics when BSD is different unless there's a good reason
  not to.
o If Linux were more like BSD, why should I prefer it over BSD?  I've got
  source for BSD and it hasn't changed much over the last ten years (i.e.,
  more stable, easier to learn and stay current).

Huh?  I expect the more common case is that the contents of the file
matter, in which case SVr4 semantics make much more sense.  Being able to
completely replace the content of a file, but not actually delete it, is
just plain silly 99% of the time.  File-based semaphores are the possible
exception.  (Even that is a stretch, IMHO.)  I only acknowledged the
exception.  That's not the same as suggesting the exception is the common
case.

Q: If removing restrictions is intrinsicly bad, then why not drop GIDs and
   world-access altogether?  Just base all access on the UID.  If it's good 
   for /tmp, why not the rest of the file system?
A: Because GIDs and world access allow more *useful* behavior and make
   secure programming more convenient -- while not preventing UID-only
   access if you want or need it.
	Hope this explains,
