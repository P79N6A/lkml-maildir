Sorry, a quick question, as I seem to be blind today...
sd.c helpfully says:
/*
 * requeue_sd_request() is the request handler function for the sd driver.
 * Its function in life is to take block device requests, and translate
 * them to SCSI commands.
 */
This could usefully be deleted, as this function doesnt exist.
However I cannot find the code that actually does this - any pointers?
thanks
Justin
