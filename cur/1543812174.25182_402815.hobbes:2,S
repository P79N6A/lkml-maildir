The 4-character strings in the path names (eg "CPU0") are _arbitrary_.
They come _directly_ from the BIOS source code and depend
on whatever mood the BIOS writer was in that day.
For this reason, users _can't_ count on these strings
and these path-names being consistent across platforms.
Yes, this is a horrible design.
Yes, I want to delete it in favor of sysfs as soon as possible,
Patrick has a big patch set in development to get that ball rolling.
Yes, users kick and scream whenever you change something they can see
and thus it takes a long time.
