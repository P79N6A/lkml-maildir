serial console & netconsole - see Documentation/serial-console.txt and
Documentation/networking/netconsole.txt
And there's also the kernel "console on line printer" option if you
want the messages printed on a printer instead.  You also have the
option of writing the text down by hand with pen & paper (using a fb
console with lots of lines help keep many messages visible for this) -
some people also use a digital camera to take a photo of the screen.
