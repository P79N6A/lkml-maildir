It's not clear precisely who or what would benefit from it; however,
the decreased maximum of 32 swapfiles on i386 is a regression vs.
2.4.x's limit of 64, in whatever sense something no one cares about is
actually a regression (in principle they could have merely not spoken
up about it).
In other words, if someone feels itchy because the number went down
from 2.4.x, here it is. If not, I'm fine with leaving it be.

P.S.
If desired, I can also send in the code to utilize the extra bits on
PAE, or turn things into a config option, or whatever. Joe Blow random
VM hacker at your service etc.
