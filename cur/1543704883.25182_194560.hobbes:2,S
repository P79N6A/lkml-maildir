It would probably a good idea to implement it for i386 on chipsets
that support it reliably and try to educate driver writers to 
enable it when they are testing drivers. This would likely 
improve the quality of linux drivers long term and make your
job as maintainer of an "anal IO error" platform easier.
Just it should not be enabled by default in production kernels.
And finding out where it works reliably will be some work.

There is no reason pci_map_single() has to panic on overflow. On x86-64
it returns an unmapped address that is guaranteed to cause an bus abort
for 128KB. And you have an macro to test for it (pci_dma_error()). 
I believe ppc64 has adopted it too. Of course most drivers don't 
use it yet.
Still panic on overflow is useful for testing and it is kept as an
kernel command line option.
