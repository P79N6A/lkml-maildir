First, before I get to my point, I want to say that I fully understand
your argument, and I also bitch when people patch the files I maintain.
But.
That is courtesy, not a right or need.  The -beauty- of open source is
that anyone can hack on my files, or devfs, and if the patch makes
sense, it will get applied, regardless of whether I am a crotchety old
a-hole or not.  (I am :))
