Hi Linus, all
Just tried your buffer.c patch (to 2.2.0-pre7-ac4), and you asked:
"does that make your performance less jerky?"
Yep, a LOT! :)
- My read-large-mailbox-with-pine-'locking' problem mentioned before seem
  to have gone! 
  At least i wasn't able to reproduce it again, even not after some stress
 testing (scrolling trough same _even larger_ mailbox in pine,
 /sbin/swapout 200  (256MB onboard), kernel compiling, X in 32bpp,
 netscape+java, find /, etc)
- A kernel compile (make dep clean zImage modules modules_install) with
 lots of unneeded modules takes now just 13 minutes instead of normal 14+
 minutes (2'nd compile after stresstest).
Im very positive about that patch, but i've _just_ 1h17 uptime yet, and
i havn't rebooted yet to do a fs-check.
More penguins to follow ? :)

Argh!  All right, so how am I supposed to work with Linux when
everything's already been done?!  Can't these people leave some
broken MSDOS like parts so there's problems left to solve!?....
