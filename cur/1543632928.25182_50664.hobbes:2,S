I don't have the slightest doubt that it is a kernel bug: I observed the
same with the /dev/hdc device (the CDROM). Playing Audio-CD's doesn't work
since 2.5.19. It worked for years now with the same permissions, and giving
more liberal rights doesn't help either. It always returns with EACCES!
  open("/dev/cdrom", O_RDONLY|O_NONBLOCK) = 3
  ioctl(3, CDROMVOLREAD, 0xbffff1f8)      = -1 EACCES (Permission denied)
  ioctl(3, CDROMSUBCHNL, 0xbffff1fc)      = -1 EACCES (Permission denied)
It works, however, for root! Could this be some broken capability
settings?
