At first thought it'll need adding a field to struct usb_serial to save
the driver_info from the ID table in usb_serial_probe. It's something I'd
like to discuss actually. I hate fields which store information this
way: filled in one place, used in another place... From the perspective
of code prettiness I would rather add another method for usb_serial_probe
to call. But I'm not sure really.
