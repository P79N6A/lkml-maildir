Subject: module-init-tools breaks kallsyms

Install of module-init-tools moves the old tools to *.old but it doesn't
address kallsyms.  In the case of kallsyms being a link to insmod, it
breaks.  Since the new insmod is supposed to call insmod.old when
appropriate, I'm not sure why it breaks.  But it doesn't work here.
To successfully compile a kernel < 2.5.47-bk2 after module-init-tools
installation, with kallsyms being a symlink, you need to link it to
insmod.old instead.
