I suppose. I have a feeling there's an underlying issue behind "code 
standards" (and even then, I think that code standards is ultimately an 
excuse for not integrating reiser4 support into the kernel, but that's 
just my opinion). However, is the code really in such a shape that the 
community doesn't want to maintain it? Obviously there's a significant 
number of people interested in reiser4 - if there weren't, questions like 
this wouldn't keep getting asked.
