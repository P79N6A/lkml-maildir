 *curious* - why haven't these mods been merged back yet?

 okay.
 question for you.
 would there be any reason (e.g. performance increase)
 which could justify providing the block device remapping
 facility at the linux device driver level instead of in
 xen's fun-and-games?
 the non-technical (but aesthetic) justification is that
 xen provides the facility to represent block devices
 (major+minor) for use as generic block devices _anyway_ -
 just in a rather roundabout (and exclusionary i.e.
 "unfair!! i wanna play!!") manner.
 l.
 p.s. mark, what the hell are _you_ doing up at 3am??? :)
