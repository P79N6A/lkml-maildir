I am thinking about using ioctls to "reset" a char device but I have been
reading that ioctls are only in linux.  I'd like to make the interface to
my driver as portable as possiable so this seems like a bad idea.  What
other userland interfaces exist.  It seems as though I can read and write
froma  char device and thats about all that is standard.  this would mean
I would have to do some sort of a parse for a special character.  Also,
ioctls seem to have assigned numbers.  If it is a new device type can I
just use my own?
Where is there a good primer on ioctl. Both in its use in programs and in
drivers.
from what I gather when my deivce gets an ioctl call my ioctl function
will be called and i will get an argument that the program in user space
specified.  Is this correct?
