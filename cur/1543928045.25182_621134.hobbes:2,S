Subject: can support for "rpm"-based package building just be dropped?
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

  by that, i mean *requiring* the "rpmbuild" command, and not
accepting "rpm" as a subsititute, as you can read in
scripts/package/Makefile:
# Do we have rpmbuild, otherwise fall back to the older rpm
RPM := $(shell if [ -x "/usr/bin/rpmbuild" ]; then echo rpmbuild; \
                   else echo rpm; fi)
  on current systems, "rpm" no longer has build capability and will
fail thusly:
rpm --target i386 -ta ../kernel-2.6.24rc3g2ffbb837dirty.tar.gz
--target: unknown option
  so it would make more sense to just require "rpmbuild" on the
machine, would it not?
