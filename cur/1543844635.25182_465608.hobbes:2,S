No this is bad design. Each time you want to access those memory map
register you should use read{bwl}/in{bwl} variants.
After all memory mapped register are not so different of mmio on standard
PC.
For example on au1x00 mips platform [1], some helper are defined to access
those memory map registers.
using volatile is awful : instead of a clean API to access those
registers, you often forgot that volatile is need which lead to very hard
to debug bugs (depend of compiler optimization, state of memory, ...).
For example on a embedded platform (ADI fusiv) where volatile are used
everywhere, some developers forgot some, which lead to random lockup on
boot.
