thanks for your quick response ...
yes it's the hole 2.6.18+ series which is provided by RedHat, i'm 
currently compiling a 2.6.25-3 to verify that the problem still persists in
the new versions. I'll try to get it running today an let you know, if 
so i'll forward the code and instructions how to recreate the problem to the
enclosed recipients only ...
kind regards
