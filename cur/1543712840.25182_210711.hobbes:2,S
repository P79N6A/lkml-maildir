I tried 2.6.5-rc3-mm1 with a lilo.conf which had:
           append="earlyprintk=vga acpi=off"
It booted all the way to trying to mount the root filesystem (which is
on /dev/sda1) and complained something about
        801earlyprintk=vga
being a bad device name.  It looks like the ' ' before earlyprintk has
been swallowed.
(lilo would have made a command line of
  auto BOOT_IMAGE=5 ro root=801 earlyprintk=vga acpi=off
)
I tried again with
           append="earlyprintk=vga acpi=off root=08:01"
and it worked fine.
I hunted around and found parse_early_options and commented out
					if (to != *cmdline_p)
						to -= 1;
one the basis that it look suspicious, and as "to" is never (as far as
I can see) going to have the same value as *cmdline_p.
With this change, it boots nicely with the original append= line.
(The broken-out patch has a comment, but no "From:" line so I wasn't
sure who really should be told....)
