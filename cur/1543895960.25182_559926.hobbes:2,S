Absolutely right.  And we'll get to that.  Please just be patient.
In fact, how much the company cares about tivoizing is completely
irrelevant to that point.  I shouldn't even have included it, but I
did because I thought it would be useful as a boundary condition.
So just disregard that.
Is there agreement that, comparing tivoized and non-tivoized hardware,
we get'd more contributions if the hardware is not tivoized, because
users can scratch their own itches, than we would for tivoized
hardware?
