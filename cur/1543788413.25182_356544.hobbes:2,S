Apologies for answering myself...
I found an old conversation that answered this, at least when I'm
logged in as root. Hopefully it will work at boot time also:
chrt -f -p 80  `pidof "IRQ 58"`
I noted that the default chrt command changed the IRQ process from
SCHED_FIFO to SCHED_RR so I assume I really should leave it at
SCHED_FIFO?
Thanks,
Mark
