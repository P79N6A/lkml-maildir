c't, a good german computer mag, has done some test of Dual MoBos a month
ago. (c't, 12/02, p.188). They performed some low-level benchmarks ... on
PCI ... transfer rates on different PCI slots with and without parallel
access to IDE. They used RocketDrive (RD), a solid-state HD, to test.
Funnily, all mainboards had one or another low number in there. For the Tyan
MPX (S2466N-4M), it was writing to RD in 32bit slot with only 29 MB/s
without concurrent IDE access and 24MB/s with concurrent IDE access.
Of course way enough for burning CDs. Two more low numbers: When writing
to RD in 64 bit PCI slot, the IDE only made 19/20 MB/s for read/write.
Those tests were performed under Win AFAICS, so maybe the PCI stuff under
Linux is set up differently ...
These numbers itself are no reason to worry, of course, but they may
indicate that arbitration may not be fair and may leave one device without
data for more than a short moment. Current CD-writers are like 16x with
a 4MB buffer, which means they should not be left w/o data for more than
1.7s and throughput should not go below 2.4 MB/s.
OK, this is really unlikely a PCI implementation would be that unfair with
test engineers noticing. Maybe strange occasional PCI aborts causing a long
recovery ...
Just a strange idea, of course.
