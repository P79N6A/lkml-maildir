Thats over complicating stuff I think.

Which is a real pain. I think its the right 2.5 answer. I'm not happy
about breaking that (even if its only for the m68k userbase in 2.4)
either.
I don't think command parsing is the right place. Turn your IDE layer
"right endian" and most stuff begins to look a lot saner already. 
The "fixing" needs to be happening at the top of the IDE layer not
in the driver itself. For 2.5 that ought to be loopback or similar
for 2.4 it makes sense I think to effectively implement an endian
switcher without loopback for compatibility.
