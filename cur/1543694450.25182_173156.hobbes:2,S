That is because most of the errors (which are few) get lost
in the noise of BSODs or are trivial data errors.  Can you
tell whether your application crashed because it had a bug
or because a bit in memory flipped?  Is tiis a typm or did a
bit or two flip on this email message?  There is a big
difference between single bit errors and having an entire
block of a file be wrong.

There is a big difference between the probability of any
random pair of blocks getting a false positive, much less a
given block with some corruption still hashing the same and
a false positive between one block and any of millions of
others.
It is a bit like the difference in odds between you winning
at this weeks lotto and anyone winning this week.  Are you
willing to bet that nobody wins this weeks lotto?  Would you
stake your life savings on it?
