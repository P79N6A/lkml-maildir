The FPGA requires a physical reset-pin toggle to load new
bits into the gate-array. This could be software-toggled,
but that would require at least one external gate. This
is because the power-reset needs to reset the chip before
its bits are loaded plus some pin, after loading, needs to
be an output to its reset pin also. Therefore, you need
the external gate that is always present.
