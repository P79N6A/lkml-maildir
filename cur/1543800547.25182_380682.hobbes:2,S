Just use `inline'.  With gcc-3 it'll be inlined.
With gcc-4 and Ingo's patch it _might_ be inlined.  And it _might_ be
uninlined by the compiler if someone adds a second callsite later on. 
Maybe.  We just don't know.  That's a problem.  Use of __always_inline will
remove this uncertainty.
So our options appear to be:
a) Go fix up stupid inlinings (again) or
b) Apply Ingo's patch, then go add __always_inline to places which we
   care about.
Either way, we need to go all over the tree.  In practice, we'll only
bother going over the bits which we most care about (core kernel, core
networking, a handful of net and block drivers).  I suspect many of the bad
inlining decisions are in poorly-maintained code - we've been pretty
careful about this for several years.
