I just downloaded glibc 2.3.1 and would say you can subvert a
privileged executable with LD_PRELOAD. There's no mention of
PR_GET_DUMPABLE anywhere and __libc_enable_secure is set according to
some euid/egid tests.
Hopefully, someone more fluent in glibc issues can shed some light?
Is there a way to switch LD_PRELOAD off completely or on a needed
basis?
Regards, Olaf.
