It would be very nice to get Mr. Daplas back.

My opinion (only) is that any subsystem that has lots of doc and/or
kernel parameters should put that info into Documentation/<subdir>/,
so adding to Documentation/fb/ is good.  (sound is another big
candidate for this.  All of those "snd-xyz=" entries in
kernel-parameters.txt don't actually help other than to say that there
are some user-settable parameters that someone has to go search for.)
We should probably also extend this entry in kernel-parameters.txt:
 	video=		[FB] Frame buffer configuration
			See Documentation/fb/modedb.txt.
to point to Documentation/fb/ for all frame buffer docs.
