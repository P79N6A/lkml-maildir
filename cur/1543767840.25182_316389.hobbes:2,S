Or we could teach scripts/mkmakefile to do it for all of us.  I can post
a patch that would call scripts/mkmakefile regardless of whether O= is
used, and scripts/mkmakefile would generate makefile rather than
Makefile.

Good to know.  But my point still stands.
If I have a build tree already compiled for a specific architecture, and
I'm going to compile an external driver against that tree, why do I need
to set ARCH and CROSS_COMPILE to match those used during compilation?
Why cannot the build system do it for me?
Also, if I want to recompile the kernel after changing the source, I
want to run make in the build tree.  That's what the generated Makefile
is for.  But if I overrode ARCH or CROSS_COMPILE, I have to remember to
do it again.  And that's what I want to fix.
I'm sure I can write a very intelligent script tuned for my system that
would do the right thing and that will even set CROSS_COMPILE based on
the architecture from .config file.  But I want to share my code, not to
hoard it.
Maybe I should try to implement saving ARCH and CROSS_COMPILE in .config
file, but it would be more intrusive.
