Greg,
I still have three DVB patches that need to go to 2.6.19.y, the dvbdev patch
being most important.  I sent this dvbdev patch to you during the 2.6.19.5
review period and expected it to surface this time around, but maybe our email
paths have crossed.
Since I am unable to send patches inline from my current location, I've posted
the three pending patches for 2.6.19.y here:
http://linuxtv.org/~mkrufky/stable/2.6.19.y/
Please add these if possible.  Again, the
"dvbdev-fix-illegal-re-usage-of-fileoperations-struct" patch is the most
important one of these.
---
For 2.6.20.y, I have seven patches waiting for the v4l-dvb subsystem trees.  I
have posted these patches here:
http://linuxtv.org/~mkrufky/stable/2.6.20.y/
If you can queue these up for the next 2.6.20.y release, that would be great.
Otherwise, if I don't see them added to the queue, I will send them inline to
you the next time I am at my own machine (a few days from now).
Regards,
Michael Krufky
