Subject: [PATCH] kernel/futex.c: Uneeded memory barrier
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

	Hi Rusty,
	Patch against 2.6-test5.
	Kills an unneeded set_current_state after schedule_timeout, since it 
already guarantees that the task will be TASK_RUNNING.
	Also, when setting the state to TASK_RUNNING, isn't that memory 
barrier unneeded? Patch removes this memory barrier too.
	If it looks good, please consider applying.
	Thanks.
Felipe
