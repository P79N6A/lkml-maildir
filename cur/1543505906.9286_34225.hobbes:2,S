Hello Hackers,
I was trying to find out how the "slab" package should be used with 
my SoundBlaster 32. During that I had two complete kernel lockups 8-((
In X the mouse suddenly stopped moving, and every process was held 
immediately. No console switching possible, no numlock, etc.
After reset and fsck, the syslock had a few "Sound: Recording 
overrun" messages before the thing stopped, but about 30 seconds 
passed until lock up.
I suspect that the error condition is not correctly handled in the 
sound driver. Of course this bug gives a very bad reputation to Linux 
reliability. Maybe try to find a workaround quickly.
Regards,
Ulrich Windl
