I realise all that.  But I'd have thought that the mempool approach is
actually better: use the page allocator and only deplete your reserve pool
when the page allocator fails.
The refill-the-pool-in-the-background feature sounds pretty worthless to
me.  On a uniprocessor machine (for example), the kernel thread may not get
scheduled for tens of milliseconds (easily), which is far, far more than is
needed for that reserve pool to become fully consumed.
