Three reasons that I think of off the top of my head (and there might
well be more reasosn) why this should change:
a) consistency with the other two timer APIs (POSIX timers
(timer_create(), etc.), and setitimer()/getitimer()).
b) Returning the amount of time until the next expiration  is more
useful to userland: I'd say the most common case is for userland to
want to know how long until the next expiration occurs, or to adjust
that time by adding/subtracting some value to the existing setting.
That is difficult to with the current implementation: the userland app
must use timer_gettime(), call clock_gettime(), and calculate the
difference between the two, in order to know how much time remains
until the next timer expiration.
c) Currently, the information returned differs depending on whether
TFD_TIMER_ABSTIME is specified -- this is not the case for the
analogous situation for POSIX timers.  For POSIX timers, the returned
setting is always the amount of time until the timer next expires.
This inconsistency is messy for applications -- the application may
not (be able to) know whether or not the timer it is examining was set
using TFD_TIMER_ABSTIME (the timerfd might have been created by a
library, for example).
Cheers,
Michael
