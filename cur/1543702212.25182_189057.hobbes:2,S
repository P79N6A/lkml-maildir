Hello,
Sorry for cross-posting, but I have a problem that I am not sure whom
to address... Google did not reveal anything helpfull.
I resently moved to kernel 2.6.0 (on Debian Sarge), and while everything
seems to work just fine, to my surprise gdb now fails to debug
executables that are linked against pthread:
GNU gdb 5.3-debian
[snip]
This GDB was configured as "i386-linux"...
(gdb) b main
Breakpoint 1 at 0x80483a4: file foo.c, line 3.
(gdb) r
Starting program: /root/a.out
Error while reading shared library symbols:
Cannot find new threads: capability not available
Cannot find user-level thread for LWP 714: capability not available
With kernel 2.4.22 this problem did not occur. Do you have any idea what
may have caused this problem, and how to solve it? If I can provide you
with any information that could be helpfull, please let me know.
Kind regards,
Maarten
gcc version 3.3.2 (Debian)
GNU gdb 5.3-debian
GNU libc 2.3.2
