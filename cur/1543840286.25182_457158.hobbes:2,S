This can cause a deadlock sometimes, when a thread tries to take the
read_lock() recursively, with a writer having come in between the two
recursive reads:
	Reader1 on CPU0			Writer1 on CPU1
	read_lock() - success
					write_lock() - blocks on Reader1
						  (writer_active = 1)
	read_lock() - blocks on Writer1
The only way to avoid this deadlock is to either keep track of
cpu_hp_lock_count per-task (like the preemption count kept per-task)
or allow read_lock() to succeed if reader_count > 1 (even if
writer_active = 1). The later makes the lock unduely biased towards
readers.
