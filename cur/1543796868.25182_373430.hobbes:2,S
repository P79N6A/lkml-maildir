That suprises me. Heinz does respond to things and actively asks for
help on stuff like dmraid

Please understand Justin Gibbs gave the Linux community emd in about as
productive a way that the US/UK government "gave" Iraq democracy.
Whatever the reasons for that and where the fault lies is another matter
but the result was not productive.
For long term maintenance and sanity reasons Linux is about doing things
in a logical consistent manner. Many people have had to learn to do
things the way Linus wants or the kernel expects, me included. It is
from that sort of process we have the current excellent e100 ethernet
driver still from Intel but not at all the Intel original for example.
We've consistently avoided hiding software raid behind magical
abstractions. There are numerous reasons for this. We want disks to move
between controllers easily for example, which vendors usually want to
make as painful as possible to create lockin.
