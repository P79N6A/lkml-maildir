indeed. I'd exclude the ioctls at this point. But:

i dont yet see how this conclusion follows. Here's the poll() code
(simplified):
                poll_enter = jack_get_microseconds ();
                ret = poll (driver->pfd, nfds, driver->poll_timeout);
		[...]
		if (extra_fd < 0) {
			if (driver->poll_next && poll_ret > driver->poll_next) {
				*delayed_usecs = poll_ret - driver->poll_next;
			} 
			driver->poll_last = poll_ret;
			driver->poll_next = poll_ret + driver->period_usecs;
			driver->engine->transport_cycle_start (driver->engine, 
							       poll_ret);
		}
is there a mechanism that ensures that the next poll() will be called
_before_ ->poll_next? Do you get a real hard ALSA xrun in that case or
something similar?
if it's possible to 'silently' overrun the next due interrupt (somewhat,
but not large enough overrun to cause a hard ALSA xrun) then the
processing delay will i believe be accounted as a 'wakeup delay'. In
that case to make the delayed_usecs value truly accurate, i'd at least
add this:
                poll_enter = jack_get_microseconds ();
		if (poll_enter > driver->poll_next) {
			/*
			 * This processing cycle got delayed over
			 * the next due interrupt! Do not account this
			 * as a wakeup delay:
			 */
			driver->poll_next = 0;
		}
but i'd also suggest to put in a counter into that branch so that this
condition doesnt get lost. In fact the Maximum Process Cycle stat from
Rui:
>>   Maximum Delay . . . . . . . . .    6904       921       721    usecs
>>   Maximum Process Cycle . . . . .    1449      1469      1590    usecs
seems to suggest that there can be significant processing delays? (if
Maximum Process Cycle is indeed the time spent from poll_ret to the next
poll_enter.)
