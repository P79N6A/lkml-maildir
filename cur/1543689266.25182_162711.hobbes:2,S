That's not true. It never has been true in Linux.
Private mappings that haven't been broken by COW (and a read-only mapping
never will be) will see updates as they happen on the file that backs it.
That's the fundamental difference between "mmap(MAP_PRIVATE)" and
"read()".
You may not like it, and others too have not liked it (Hurd and Mach do 
this big dance about MAP_COPY that really creates a static _copy_ of the 
state at the time of the mmap), but it's just a fact.
Repeat after me: private read-only mappings are 100% equivalent to shared
read-only mappings. No ifs, buts, or maybes. This is a FACT. It's a fact 
codified in many years of Linux implementation, but it's a fact outside of 
that too.
(Yeah, yeah, I know some broken old Unixes do not offer mmap consistency
guarantees, and nntpd is unhappy. But Linux isn't broken.)
