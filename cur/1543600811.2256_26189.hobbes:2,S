Yes, JFS as well, but this is somewhat unrelated to using buffers as io
handles.

one mapping for all buffers accessed through getblk, get_hash_table, bread,
and the block device.

It would be through page->buffers.  Of course, this part is entirely
uncoded, but the nice thing about an address space on top of the physical
device is that bh->b_blocknr and bh->b_size directly compute to the offset
in the device.  This means the order of the buffers on page->buffers does
not have to be related to the location of the data they point to.
So, along the lines of what Andrea suggested, buffer heads can be allocated
as needed, regardless of the blocksizes already in use in the page.  The
current blkdev page cache code would need to be updated to use this idea,
but it should work.
