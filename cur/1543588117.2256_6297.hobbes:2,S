In some sense it does - it dies if you've passed it not a power of two ;-)
I don't think that segfault is a good way to report the problem, though...
Problem with mkfs is obvious, but kernel side is also shady - we could
have cleaner code if we assumed that inode size is power of 2. As it
is, we have a code in read_super() that checks for size == 128 _and_
code that was apparently writen in assumption that it can be not a
power of 2. However, if that was the really the goal, we fail - code
in ext2_read_inode() actually would break with such sizes.
In other words, the real question is what the hell are we trying to
do there. If we want code that deals with sizes that are not powers of 2
we need to change ext2_read_inode() and friends. It wouldn't be
hard. OTOH, if we guarantee that inode size will always remain a power of
2 we can simplify the thing. In any case current situation doesn't
make much sense. The only question is direction of fix.
Could those who introduced ->s_inode_size tell what use had been intended?

It's not that simple - if you need 160 bytes per inode rounding it up
to the next power of two will lose a lot. On 4Kb fs it will be
16 inodes per block instead of 25 - 36% loss...
