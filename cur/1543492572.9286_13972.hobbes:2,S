The mount options for /net should be more restrictive, and soft mounts
should never be encouraged:

 showmount -e "$key" | tail +2 | sort | sed -e "s|^\([^ 	]*\).*|$key\1 $opts $key:\1|"
$key could do with a more checking too. You should force $key to be a
hostname (see the DNS RFC for the set of valid characters), and you
should throw away hostnames beginning with "-". This will avoid $key
being passed to showmount as an option or to sed with an extra "|".
Also, you should throw away any entry from showmount that contains the
string "/../" or fails to have a leading '/'.
