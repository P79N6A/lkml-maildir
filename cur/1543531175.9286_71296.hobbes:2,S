Cray YMP-8 - reached 100% several years ago. Replace by C90, C90 replaced
by dual SV1 system. SV1 system at 80%, expanding to 4 nodes.
SGI Power Challenge array - reached 90% usage in 1 year. Replaced by Origin
2000. Origin 2000 (128 node) updated when load reached 80% (with several
OOM crashes due to managements choice to overcommit) Added another 128 nodes,
and a TB of disk (30-40GB used for swap.. still overcommitted, but not as
severly). I have more.

Of course it is. If too many users are on one system trying to do too much
at one time the system fails. Resource quotas force the users to schedule
their work, and to cooperate with the system to accomplish the goals of
business management.

I didn't - legitimate use was guaranteed. Crashing the system wasn't one
of the legitimate uses. Nor was causing the failure of other users processes.

Thats just it - the system was saturated.

If it were idle there would be no OOM error messages :)

not your site - it keeps crashing.
