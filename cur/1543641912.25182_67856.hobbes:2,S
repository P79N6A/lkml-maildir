dep_bool '  New mountalike partitioning code' CONFIG_PARTMOUNTING CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL CONFIG_WHATEVER
Or, since we're talking about the future:
<bool name="PARTMOUNTING">
 <title>
  New mount-alike partitioning code
 </title>
 <dep name="EXPERIMENTAL" sense="include" />
 <dep name="WHATEVER" sense="exclude" />
</bool>
