Version 1.8 of my x86 performance-monitoring counters driver is
now available at 
http://www.csd.uu.se/~mikpe/linux/perfctr/.
Summary:
Version 1.8, 2001-01-23
- Added preliminary interrupt-mode support to virtual perfctrs.
  Currently for P6 only, and the local APIC must have been enabled.
  Tested on 2.4.0-ac10 with CONFIG_X86_UP_APIC=y.
  When an i-mode vperfctr interrupts on overflow, the counters are
  suspended and a user-specified signal is sent to the process. The
  user's signal handler can read the trap pc from the mmap:ed vperfctr,
  and should then issue an IRESUME ioctl to restart the counters.
  The next version will support buffering and automatic restart.
