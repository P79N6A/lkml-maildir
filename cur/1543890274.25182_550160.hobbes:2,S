With likely(), unlikely() and noinline *not* defined as NOP's performance 
drops:
10000 run averages:
'Tiny LZO':
        Combined: 84.9292 usec
        Compression: 42.4646 usec
        Decompression: 42.4646 usec
'miniLZO':
        Combined: 61.3548 usec
        Compression: 43.5648 usec
        Decompression: 17.79 usec
However, I'm worried that my testbed code - likely the Perl script that 
actually loops the test code and collects its output - is somehow faulting, 
as the way that the Compression and Decompression code have the exact same 
value.
I'm going to toss some debugging output in the script and see if I can spot 
the problem.
