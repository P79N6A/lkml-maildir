Sure you can, but the trick is to send one (1) signal to a group of tasks.
Not n times the same signal to n tasks. IMHO, the POSIX semantics of
signal delivery require a shared signal queue and a private queue. The
shared signal queue is used for signals which are sent to the "process" as
a whole (translate to a group of cloned tasks in Linux) and the private
queue is use for signals sent to an individual thread (translate to one
task of a group of cloned tasks in Linux).
I have implemented a shared signal queue implementation which is triggered
by yet another CLONE_* flag. It seems to work, although I would like some
people to have a look at it.
I feel that this behaviour should be optional. It is useful under certain
circumstances, but it may hurt performance in other cases. For instance,
it could be useful in the situation where signals are used to notify a
group of threads of incoming data on a huge number of sockets. This should
fix the problem noted in the past with the bad performance of select/poll
when handling huge amounts of file descriptors.
On the other hand the shared signal queue introduces inter-thread
dependencies which might hurt certain real-time applications. A lock on
the shared signal queue is needed to prevent two threads simultaneously
accessing the signal queue. This might introduce unwanted delays.
