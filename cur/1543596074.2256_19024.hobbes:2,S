I am seeing the same problem.
I had to plug my tulip to 10Mbps HUB yesterday, and it couldn't autosense
(options=0) 10Mbps Halfduplex! It tried to use 100Mbps or something..
Also, If I try to create 100Mbps Fullduplex connection with cross-cable
between two tulip-cards (2.2.19 on the other end, and 2.4.5 on the other
end) it doesn't work either.
