Err...  Because the conditional expression is implicitly compared with
0 [6.8.4.1]/#2.  If 0 is not to be used explicitly in pointer
contexts, why should it be ok to use it implicitly?

[6.5.3.3]/#5 defines the result of the logical negation operator
based on the result of comparing the expression with 0.

I don't see why (!ptr) is any more confusing than (ptr != 0), and why
(ptr != NULL) would be any clearer.  Is `ptr != 0' one of the cases
that are not bad?
