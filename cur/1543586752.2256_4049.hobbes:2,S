Well, the configure help is now "scattered around": The configuration
options are in the "configure.in" files, and hte docs for them are
somewhere else, even if it's in one large file.
I'm not sure if Larry's CML2 has the help for the options near the
options or not, but that's how I'd like it to be if I were designing
the thing from scratch. (a bit like emacs' functions: there too, you
give the help text near the definition of a functions!)
