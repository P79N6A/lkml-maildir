The problem is that two files are getting the same inode number because 
their offsets are the same.
ls -lai:
3412140 -rw-r--r--  1 root root       0 Jan  1  1970 ./etc/mtab
3412140 -rw-r--r--  1 root root    1220 Jan  1  1970 ./etc/nsswitch.conf
So, if /etc/mtab is read first, /etc/nsswitch.conf ends up with size zero, 
because it uses the mtab inode.
Andreas Gruenbacher suggested this change.  Along with your patch, things 
are working here again:
