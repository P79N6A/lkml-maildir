Lacking any other indication MODULE_LICENSE is supposed to mark the license 
that the code is being distributed under. If companies are intentionally 
mis-using this to get around the "internal interfaces" limitations (where 
some interfaces are not available unless the module is GPL'd) and the warning 
message printed in the logs when the module is not GPL'd then they are 
(technically) in violation of the law. (interfaces that are GPL only are 
considered so internal to the kernel that using them makes your code GPL 
because of the inclusion of GPL'd code. And no - I am not going to get into 
that discussion - it's pointless)
In the end, using MODULE_LICENSE for any purpose other than declaring the 
chosen license for the code is deceptive. So it is easily arguable that by 
not including any license with the code other than the MODULE_LICENSE 
statement and then trying to prosecute because MODULE_LICENSE doesn't 
accurately state the license on the code is entrapment and illegal.
