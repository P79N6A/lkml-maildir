Hello,
I installed Linux kernel 2.2.6 (Slackware). The problem that I'm having is
that when I try to reconfigure the kernel and type make zImage in the
/usr/src/linux-2.2.6 directory I get this error right away.
make: *** No rule to make target
`/mirrors/slackware-ftp-current/slakware/k1/lx/usr/src/linux-2.2.6/include/asm/param.h',
needed by
`/mirrors/slackware-ftp-current/slakware/k1/lx/usr/src/linux-2.2.6/include/linux/sched.h'.
Stop.
Do you know how to fix this or if this is a bug?
Brian
