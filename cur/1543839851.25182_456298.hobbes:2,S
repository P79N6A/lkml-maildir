Hello,
kernel 2.6.17 ships with xt_MARK, but iptables 1.3.5 still uses ipt_MARK. 
In essence, I cannot use `iptables -j MARK` giving me 
# iptables -A INPUT -j MARK --set-mark 1
iptables: Unknown error 4294967295
I have seen this before and the problem behind this strange error (-1) is 
that the .targetsize/.matchsize variables in the kernel modules do not 
match their userspace parts.
However, this time it seems to be something different:
# iptables -t mangle -A INPUT -j MARK --set-mark 1
Works without problems. Am I missing something?
How do I get MARK back to work in -t filter -- possibly without hacking in 
xt_MARK.c?
