I think it has to do with the EDID code. The code works but for the intel 
platform I'm grabbing data form the BIOS. I have seen 3 responses. The 
first is the EDID header is corrupt. This is what happens to me. The 
second is it gives wrong data. The screen that the EDID reports is 
different from the one we request via the VESA mode setting BIOS call.
THe final is it actually works. The way to fix this is to remove the EDID
code in vesafb.c. I will push a patch for that soon.
