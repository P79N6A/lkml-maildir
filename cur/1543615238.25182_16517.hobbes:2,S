This has been suggested too.  And if someone implemements this in the
2.5.x timeframe it might even go in (as long as it works w/ gcc-2.95.x,
which really should be doable).

This is what Franz Sirl suggested awhile back, which should work, but
doesn't look too nice.  If gcc-3.0.x is going to be expected to produce a
working kernel on all arches, I suppose this is the best fix for now.
