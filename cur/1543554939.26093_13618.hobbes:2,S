	Can I have a hot plug PCI bridge card that connects to
a regular PCI backplane (perhaps as some kind of CardBus docking
station card)?  If so, all PCI drivers should use __dev{init,exit}{,data}.
	The other excellent points that you raise apply equally to
the driver before and after my patch (although my patch made it
more clear that the struct netdevice parameters previously being
passed around were always null).  It is important to realize this
becase, as of yesterday, Dave had said that he was not going to
apply the new style PCI changes at this point, but had integrated
the MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE changes.  So, Dave: you should look at
the points that Jeff raised, even if you are not integrating
the rest of my new style PCI patch.
