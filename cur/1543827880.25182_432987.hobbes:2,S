If you don't remount with "-o extents" all it (currently) means is that
new files will not be created with extents.  Existing extent-mapped files
will continue to work.  It was done this way so that if some serious
problem was found with extents there was a fallback position to "normal"
block mapped files and the damage would be limited to files created while
mounted with "-o extents".
Cheers, Andreas
