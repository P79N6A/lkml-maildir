Please don't do it this way.  By making the xattr handlers constant for
a superblock's lifetime you can get rid of all the locking, and the arbitrary
limit on the number of xattrs.  Please also move the code to xattr.c where
it belong (long-term I'd like to kill the old inode ops so we can do things
like moving the permission checks for user xattrs into common code where they
belong)
Also s/simple_// for most symbols as this stuff isn't simple, in fact it's
quite complex :)
