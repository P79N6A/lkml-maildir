Subject: [PATCH] [39/40] i386: Export paravirt_ops for non GPL modules too
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/30/123

Otherwise non GPL modules cannot even do basic operations
like disabling interrupts anymore, which would be excessive.
Longer term should split the single structure up into
internal and external symbols and not export the internal
ones at all.
