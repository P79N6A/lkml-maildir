And these companies don't really do much that you can't do yourself. I
had a failing drive some years ago, where some sectors couldn't be
read. So I tried to dd the raw device to a file elsewhere. Of course,
dd will quit when it has an I/O error. So I wrote a recovery utility
that writes a zero sector if reading the input sector gives an I/O
error. Unfortunately, I couldn't mount the file (too much corruption),
but I was able to use debugfs on it. I got the most important data
back.
While I was waiting for 48 hours for the data to be pulled off (each
time a bad sector was encountered, the drive would retry several
times, with lots of clicking and rattling), I contacted one of these
recovery companies. I wanted to know if they could recover the bad
sectors. I was told no. After some probing, it turns out that all they
do is basically what I was doing. They just charge $2000 for it.
No doubt if you took your drive to your local CIA/KGB/MI6 offices,
they could recover some of those bad sectors. But I hear they charge
their customers quite a lot...
