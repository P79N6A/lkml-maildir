Paging works even in real mode, afaik. 386es used to emulate
"expanded" memory (a simple bank-switching thing for 286)
by going into protected mode, change the page tables, then
return to real mode with paging still enabled.
So you can probably use paging in "forreal" mode too. I believe
you only get the page table's memory mapping capabilities
though, I don't think you get protection of "kernel" pages
without protection enabled.  
You could still "hide" kernel memory by giving userspace another
page table, but that means page table switching on each
syscall which kills performance worse than interrupt handling
in protecxted mode.
