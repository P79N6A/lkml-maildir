In some outoftree modules of mine, the Makefile reads like this
MODULES_DIR := /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)
KSRC_DIR    := ${MODULES_DIR}/source
KOBJ_DIR    := ${MODULES_DIR}/build
all: modules
modules:
	make -C "${KOBJ_DIR}" M="$$PWD";
and one can easily override it by calling `make MODULES_DIR=/foo/bar` 
(instead of just `make`).
