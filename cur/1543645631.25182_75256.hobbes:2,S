Hi Dave,
I'm not sure how relevant page table sharing has to the halloween deadline
since it's not a feature per se, just an optimization.   It has more to do
with getting numa ia32 boxes to survive, so it's an ideal out-of-tree patch.
Anyway, I feel your pain - debugging these deep VM hacks can get very weird.
I just got back home, I'll have a read through your latest.
