I wouldn't work on RT if mainline integration wasn't on the agenda.

There is going to be positive , and negative discussion on this. I think
in the end the maintainers (Linus, and Andrew) don't want "people" to
get a patch or modification from the outside. It's best if the community
is not separated .. If you make a clean integration , and people want
what you are doing, there is no reason for it to be rejected.
