Hello.
i just attempted to test .20-rc3-git4 on a box, which has 6 drives in
raid5. it uses raid autodetection, and 2 ide controllers (via and
promise 20269).
there are two problems.
first, and most importantly, it doesent autodetect, i attempted with
both the old ide drivers, and the new pata on libata drivers, the drives
appears to be found, but the raid autoassembling just doesent happen.
this is .17, which works:
http://sh.nu/p/8001
this is .20-rc3-git4 which doesent work, in pata-on-libata mode:
http://sh.nu/p/8000
this is .20-rc3-git4 which doesent work, in old ide mode:
http://sh.nu/p/8002
second bug:
notice on these pastes the lines at bottom, the keyboard stuff, these
are repeated constantly, and caps/scrolllock button on keyboard is
blinking.
mvh.
