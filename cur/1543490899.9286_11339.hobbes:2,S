I didn't know that the tulip.c was 'adjusted' already.  I always just
copy NetGear's tulip.c over the one that comes with the kernel, and
compile away.
Personally, I'm with David.  NetGear can hardly be classified as a
'pseudo tulip abomination'.  NetGear makes some very high-quality
hardware, and I like them.  Just because it doesn't say "DEC" on the
chip doesn't mean it's bad! ;)  Which is kinda why I'd asked about a
separate driver.  Heck, *my* NetGears don't even have any DEC chips on
them!
All in fun,
