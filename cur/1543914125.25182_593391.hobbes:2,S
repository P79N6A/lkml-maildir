If people don't compile-test both now, then why would they compile-test 
things when merged?
So no, that's not the point.
But at least things like "grep" will work sanely, and people will be 
*aware* that "Oh, this touches a file that may be used by the other 
word-size".
Right now, we have people changing "i386-only" files that turn out to be 
used by x86-64 too - through very subtle Makefile things that the person 
who only looks into the i386 Makefile will never even *see*.
THAT is the problem (well, at least part of it).
