Hi,
If I compile the 2.4.0-test8 kernel on uniprocessor intel machine with SMP
support, I get no compilation problems. But when I compile on a 'netfinity'
machine with 3 intel processors with SMP support, the telnet session in
which I do this gets hung during 'make bzImage'. Though the 'bzImage' still
gets created but when I try to boot the netfinity with that image, the
system crashes and I get the following kernel messages:
Calibrating delay loop... 1795 Bogo MIPS
Stack at about c1e1bfbc

(the above line was the last thing written to the screen, it was then froze
at this point for at least 5 min.)
Has anybody faced this problem before? If anybody has booted the 2.4.x with
SMP support on the netfinity multi-processor machienes, kindly tell me the
way.
Regards,
Daljeet Maini
