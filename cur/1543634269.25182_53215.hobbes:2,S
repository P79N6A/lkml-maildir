Roy, all we know is that "nuke-buffers stops your machine from locking up".
But we don't know why your machine locks up in the first place.  This just
isn't sufficient grounds to apply it!  We need to know exactly why your
kernel is failing.  We don't know what the bug is.
You have two gigabytes of RAM, yes?  It's very weird that stripping buffers
prevents a lockup on a machine with such a small highmem/lowmem ratio.
I'll have yet another shot at reproducing it.  So, again, could you please
tell me *exactly*, in great deatail, what I need to do to reproduce this
problem?
- memory size
- number of CPUs
- IO system
- kernel version, any applied patches, compiler version
- exact sequence of commands
- anything else you can think of
Have you been able to reproduce the failure on any other machine?

No, not at all.  All the pagecache is still there - the patch just
throws away the buffer_heads which are attached to those pagecache
pages.
The 2.5 kernel does it tons better.  Have you tried it?
