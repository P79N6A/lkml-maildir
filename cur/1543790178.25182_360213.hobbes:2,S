At the moment its a bit hard to do a non PCI driver because the core
code assumes that there is a device structure (or pci_dev structure) for
everything. Fixing that is a two line change for 2.6 (probably similar
for 2.4) but Jeff Garzik rejected it. A second problem is that it
doesn't return the host_set by default but 2.4 libata doesn't have the
changes for unloading SATA modules so that should be ignorable
With that patched something like this will do the job (you'll probably
be using MMIO while the example is PIO)
static __init int legacy_init_one(unsigned long io, unsigned long ctrl,
int irq)
{
        struct ata_probe_ent ae;
        int ret;
        memset(&ae, 0, sizeof(struct ata_probe_ent));
        ae.dev = NULL;
        ae.port_ops = &legacy_port_ops;
        ae.sht = &legacy_sht;
        ae.n_ports = 2;
        ae.pio_mask = 0x1F;
        ae.irq = irq;
        ae.irq_flags = 0;
        ae.host_flags = ATA_FLAG_SLAVE_POSS;
        ae.port[0].cmd_addr = io;
        ata_std_ports(&ae.port[0]);
        ae.port[0].altstatus_addr = ctrl;
        ae.port[0].ctl_addr =   ctrl;
        ret = ata_device_add(&ae);
        if(ret == 0)
                return -ENODEV;
        legacy_host[nr_legacy_host++] = ae.host_set;
        return 0;
}
