It may work in gcc, but it is invalid according to ISO C99. First
sentence from section 6.8.6.4:
  A return statement with an expression shall not appear in a
  function whose return type is void.
Now, a function call is obviously an expression.

Gcc warns about this with the -pedantic option:
  $ gcc-3.3 -pedantic -c return.c
  return.c: In function `myfunc2':
  return.c:5: warning: `return' with a value, in function returning void
