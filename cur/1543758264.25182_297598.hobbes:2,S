Thanks for your attention.
I think It only matters when there're many scsi controllers but less disks like one disk per controller.
Even in such case
The main user of nr_real does
genhd.c:part_show()
        /* show the full disk and all non-0 size partitions of it */
        for (n = 0; n < (gp->nr_real << gp->minor_shift); n++) {
                if (gp->part[n].nr_sects) {
It's very tight loop when there's no real device.
If "(gp->nr_real << gp->minor_shift)" part is taken out from the loop
it'll be much more efficient.
And much simpler proof of "It's safe" is that
we are already living with monsters.
./drivers/md/md.c:      nr_real: MAX_MD_DEVS,   == 256
./drivers/md/lvm.c:     .nr_real        = MAX_LV,  ==  256
So using md or lvm simply adds overhead of 16 scsi controllers.
So we are safe or we are not safe already.
