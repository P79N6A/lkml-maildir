The inclusion of all the whitespace fixies makes it rather hard to
see what the patch actually does.
I'm not sure that I can be bothered with this, really.  afaict the
checks you're adding are for boot-time allocations which we tend
to assume won't fail, and they're kmalloc(small-amount, GFP_KERNEL)
which is basically infallible, and it only affects, err, alpha.
