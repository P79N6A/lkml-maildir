Why not? As far as I know, POSIX says, when you fork, your child is
not threaded; when you pthread_create, you create something that must be
visible only from within the current process (it _may_ be visible
elsewhere, but does not have to be).  So iit makes sense
for the  original parent to be the only only parent of all threads within
a process.
