NOOOO!
Please don't. 99.99% of all uses don't care one whit, and an interface 
like the above ends up being total cr*p to use.
If you care about machine check errors, use a special interface for that. 
A _really_ special one. Especially as on many systems you'll likely have 
to read status registers etc (and clear them before doing the IO) to see 
the errors.
So that way you can get errors working, AND it won't actually make normal 
code any uglier.
