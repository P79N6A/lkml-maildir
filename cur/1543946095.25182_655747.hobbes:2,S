I can confirm this problem. On my system it is not triggered by logins as my system boots into KDE, 
but as soon as NetworkManager starts and/or makes a connection, the problem is triggered. The 
wireless system is being used. I found the problem by bisection and confirmed that 
v2.6.25-rc2-238-gb45e229 will work OK if that commit is reverted.
