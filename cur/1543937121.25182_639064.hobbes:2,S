It serves essentially the same purpose as the 'async' option in /etc/exports
(i.e. we declare it "done" when the other end of the wire says it's caught
the data, not when it's actually committed), with similar latency wins.  Of
course, it's impedance-matching for bursty traffic - the 2M doesn't do much
at all if you're streaming data to it.  For what it's worth, the 80G Seagate
drive in my laptop claims it has 8M, so it probably does 4 times as much
good as 2M. ;)
