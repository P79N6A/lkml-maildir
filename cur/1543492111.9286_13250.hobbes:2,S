I gather you didn't put me in your killfile, even though you said you
had, so you may wish to note that the sort of vulgarity you used
therein is NEVER warranted...

As per my previous emails, I do NOT believe that ANYTHING should ONLY
be available in .rpm or .deb or ANY other form of packager, nor have I
ever claimed otherwise, so I have no dispute with you over that point.

Also as per my previous posts on the subject, I see NO reason to
package SOURCES in anything other than tarballs. However, as per my
previous posts on the subject, I see NOTHING WRONG in using packaging
systems such as .rpm or .deb for BINARY distribution of software,
PROVIDING it is also available in tarballs.
 > Tarballs (*.tar.gz files)...
I use .tar.bz2 files myself, and some prefer .tar.Z files for various
reasons, so I refuse to believe your claim that only .tar.gz files can
be counted as tarballs...

Of course...

That's the best way.

I'd second you on that.

I have to admit that I hadn't heard of that, but then, I only get
binary RPM's from sites I trust...

I understand your comments above, and as per my previous posts, and my
comments above, I'm in full agreement with most of them...
