Yes, you're right. I'll fix this in store_dev_name() itself, it isn't
right to limit users to only -n option. Thanks for pointing this out.
[ BTW I also noticed a typo in that file just above your extract that
mentions dev_name as a read-only attribute! That also must be fixed ... ]

Ok, thanks a lot. I'll wait for your comments / testing results over the
weekend, before sending out the next iteration.
BTW I did some testing myself, and have found another *embarrassing* bug:
if netconsole is loaded _without_ specifying any "netconsole=" parameter,
module is still kept loaded, but on unloading configfs_unregister_...()
obviously panics! :-) This should've been found by me earlier, just that
I never tested without specifying the parameter to modprobe :-(
Thanks,
Satyam
