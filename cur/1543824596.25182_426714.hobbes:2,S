Yes, that's fine.  Once patches have matured a bit, incremental (and
fine-grained) updates are preferred.  And I'll often turn
wholesale-replacement-attempts into incremental updates, so we can see what
changed.
But at this stage, rip-it-out-and-redo is fine.  Although it does help if
you can tell us which of the review comments were and were not implemented,
so we don't have to re-read the whole thing with the same level of
attention.
