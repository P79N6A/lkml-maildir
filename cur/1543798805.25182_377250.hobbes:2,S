Coincidence - I was about to post the fact that my earlier report
 was due to a pilot error (TM).
I had installed the compat-gcc packages due to legacy software
 which expected /usr/bin/gcc to be the FC2 2.96 GCC, then I
 forgot to point /usr/bin/gcc back to FC4 4.0.2 GCC.
So there is a compiler which bombs, but it's this one:
[asuardi@sandman ~]$ /usr/bin/gcc296 -v
Reading specs from /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-redhat-linux7/2.96/specs
gcc version 2.96 20000731 (Red Hat Linux 7.3 2.96-126)
Sorry for the false alarm about GCC 4.0.2. According to the
 current Documentation/Changes the 2.96 compiler seems to
 be expected to build these kernels, so perhaps there still is
 something to be looked into.
If anyone is interested I can try uninlining hpet_time_div()
 and rebuild with 2.96 then report back.
Thanks,
