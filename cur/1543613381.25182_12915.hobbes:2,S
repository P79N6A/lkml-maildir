Hi,
When booting 2.4.17-rc1, the following text appears:
-------------------------------------------- BEGIN --
Loading 2.4.17-rc1............. 
Uncompressing Linux...
ran out of input data
  -- System halted
--------------------------------------------- END ---
This has never occured to me before. I'm compiling -rc1 now on another box
(with a different gcc - mine is 2.96-85 - yes, RedHat packaged it) to make
sure this isn't due to gcc.

I would rather spend 10 hours reading someone else's source code than
10 minutes listening to Musak waiting for technical support which 
isn't. ~(Wettstein)
