Well, what way 2a supersedes 2? diff-2-2a? That would add a "2-2a" entry to
the patches dir.
But clearly this scheme is not suited for nor aimed at maintaining a tree.
It is more useful when you build a kernel from already existing bits: I
usually take stable tree X, then pre-patch Y, ac- or aa- patch Z and stuff
like newer raid/lvm patch, ide-patch, reiserfs patch, e2compr patch,
lowlatency patch etc. Later I have trouble remembering which patches went in
to that particular kernel (and which versions of those patches.)

Yes, perhaps I should make rpm out of each kernel I build - but then again
that won't help with boot disks nor with non-redhat systems.
