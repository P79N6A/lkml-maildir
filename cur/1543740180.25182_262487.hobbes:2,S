I had no choice about that really with the current locking. It's on the
list to do further work although I'd not realised some odder pppd
configurations relied upon it until the bug report.
Once I've put out -ac1 to fix the other bugs I consider urgent (not tty)
I'll see what I can do. Really it would nice if the ppp maintainer would
look at this and also fix all the horrible things the code does wrongly
if for example the first byte of a received buffer is an error marker -
in general serial error processing is not robust in the ppp code it
appears.
