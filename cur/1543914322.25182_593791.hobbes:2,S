True. That is why we want to limit the number of unmovable allocations and 
that is why ZONE_MOVABLE exists to limit those. However, unmovable 
allocations are already rare today. The overwhelming majority of 
allocations are movable and reclaimable. You can see that f.e. by looking 
at /proc/meminfo and see how high SUnreclaim: is (does not catch 
everything but its a good indicator).

All of these methods also have their own purpose aside from the mobility

Lumpy reclaim improves the situation significantly because the 
overwhelming majority of allocation during the lifetime of a systems are 
movable and thus it is able to opportunistically restore the availability 
of higher order pages by reclaiming neighboring pages.

We have this hard limit using ZONE_MOVABLE in 2.6.23.

64K pages may problematic because it is above the PAGE_ORDER_COSTLY in 
2.6.23. 32K is currently much safer because lumpy reclaim can restore 
these and does so on my systems. I expect the situation for 64K pages to 
improve when more of Mel's patches go in. We have long term experience 
with 32k sized allocation through Andrew's tree.
Reserve pools as handled (by the not yet available) large page pool 
patches (which again has altogether another purpose) are not a limit. The 
reserve pools are used to provide a mininum of higher order pages that is 
not broken down in order to insure that a mininum number of the desired 
order of pages is even available in your worst case scenario. Mainly I 
think that is needed during the period when memory defragmentation is 
still under development.
