Gargh! My system obviously cannot boot without libata. Guess it's
time to go through git log and see how to fix that build breakage
myself ...
Michal, how did you even manage to build / boot this kernel!

But I cracked this one alright. His .config has CONFIG_PROFILE_LIKELY=y
which replaces unlikely() / likely() with do_check_likely() and forces
gcc to clobber %eax with the condition itself, which in our case was
(ret < 0) == TRUE, and thus, the "1" value we saw in %eax in the
register dumps.
We should probably document somewhere that CONFIG_PROFILE_LIKELY
is not good for debugging.
Hmmm ... thinking out aloud here, but probably I don't need to fix that
libata breakage at all. I'll just put the BUG_ON(ret < 0) back in the
code, deselect PROFILE_LIKELY, and this time we _will_ have the
return of kobject_add() in %eax ...
That'll at least clear up the EEXIST vs EINVAL mystery, that'll be a
good data point, yes.
Anyway, I guess I must stop my running commentary -- will only post
after this is cleared up now :-)
