Hello,
I think the drm for my Radeon Mobility M6 might be broken since the
2.6.7 release of the kernel.
I have no problems running X under the 2.6.6 kernel (built from Debian 
sources). However when I start it under a 2.6.7 kernel (built from 
vanilla sources) there is a black screen when X starts and the 
computer is freezed (I am not even able to switch to a console). I
believe that this might be related to the radeon drm:
- when I use the vesa driver or when I disable the hardware acceleration
(NoAccel option), X starts correctly;
- when I enable hardware acceleration but I comment the line which sets 
AGPMode to 4, X runs correctly for about 20 seconds an then freezes (I 
cannot switch to a console and the SysRq are the only things left to
do);
- when hardware acceleration is activated and AGPMode is set to 4 X 
freezes immediately.
Top shows that XFree86 takes more than 95% of the processor.
I have put some files (syslog, XFree86.log, etc) which might be of
interest for you here:

Feel free to tell me if you want me to do some experiments, 
etc.
Thanks,
Samuel.
