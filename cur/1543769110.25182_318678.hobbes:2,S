Sure.  It won't be a "partition" though.

fs-blocksize chunks, yes.  (i.e. 1K or 4K blocks, not the
512 byte disk blocks.)
I don't know if aøll metadata fits iarbitrary number of block-sized chunks, 
but that cannot matter.  Any "extra" block can surely be utilized for
file data.

Managing everything in block-sized chunks is a common design in unix filesystems.
It avoids many problems and allows arbitrary filesystem sizes.
Of course some structures will need quite a few blocks, but the number
of blocks will depend on the size of the filesystem and will therefore
always fit in the available space.  (Well, unless you try creating
something silly like a 1-block fs. :-)
