This is not a bug.  All of the pointers are initialized, and if
kmalloc() fails, then one of them will be set to NULL.  However,
kfree(NULL) is a perfectly fine thing to do (kfree just returns
immediately in this case).
So this is just a way of saving some tests and optimizing for the
common case when all allocations succeed.  In other words, this is
good code -- although the spacing is slightly bogus: it should be
        if (!connector || !audio_info_req || !audio_info) {
and also using __error as a label is slightly silly -- why not just
make it "error"?
