Yes, thank you, that part was obvious already.  The question pertained
to the fact that nobody outside compiler-visible code was being handed
an address for b, and so the compiler could (if it wanted to) prove
under pretty broad assumptions that nobody could *find* b to make the
change in the first place.
Now other people assure me that the Standard explicitly rules this out,
and I'm willing to believe that--although naturally I'd still feel more 
comfortable if I'd actually seen the relevant text.  Just so long as
we're not making another wild-guess stab at solving the problem.
