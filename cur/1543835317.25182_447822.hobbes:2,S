Fix lock inversion aio_kick_handler()
lockdep found a AB BC CA lock inversion in retry-based AIO:
1) The task struct's alloc_lock (A) is acquired in process context with
interrupts enabled.  An interrupt might arrive and call wake_up() which grabs
the wait queue's q->lock (B).
2) When performing retry-based AIO the AIO core registers aio_wake_function()
as the wake funtion for iocb->ki_wait.  It is called with the wait queue's
q->lock (B) held and then tries to add the iocb to the run list after acquiring
the ctx_lock (C).
3) aio_kick_handler() holds the ctx_lock (C) while acquiring the alloc_lock (A)
via lock_task() and unuse_mm().  Lockdep emits a warning saying that we're
trying to connect the irq-safe q->lock to the irq-unsafe alloc_lock via
ctx_lock.
This fixes the inversion by calling unuse_mm() in the AIO kick handing path
after we've released the ctx_lock.

Ben, can you remember why we put unuse_mm() inside the ctx_lock?  Is that
intentional and still needed?
