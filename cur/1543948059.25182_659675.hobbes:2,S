That's right.

Which won't work if device-mapper is underneath.

The dm code is unchanged, but look at the limited endio handling in
ll_rw_blk.c:
static void bio_end_empty_barrier(struct bio *bio, int err)
{
        if (err)
                clear_bit(BIO_UPTODATE, &bio->bi_flags);
        complete(bio->bi_private);
}
int blkdev_issue_flush(struct block_device *bdev, sector_t *error_sector)
{
...
        wait_for_completion(&wait);
        if (error_sector)
                *error_sector = bio->bi_sector;
        ret = 0;
        if (!bio_flagged(bio, BIO_UPTODATE))
                ret = -EIO;
