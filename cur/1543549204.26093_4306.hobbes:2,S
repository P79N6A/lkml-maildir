Check your facts.
g++-current (3.0 to be) has a new early inliner which apparently generates
better code for some stuff (and worse for other). The C frontend so far
still does the inlining too late (in RTL instead of trees) which causes 
all the code generation problems. I don't know if the C frontend will 
gain the new inliner too before 3.0 (there seems to be some work on that), 
but gcc 3 is many months away so Linux kernel cannot count on it.
