Speaking of which, here's something I have wondered: is anyone out there 
trying to prove the correctness of core functions in the kernel? I was 
thinking this would be a fine activity for all those eager college students 
out there, or perhaps a graduate student project, a la the Stanford Checker 
project.
While I can't imagine the main developers doing such a thing, I think it'd be 
useful and might uncover some hard to find bugs.
I'd also suspect that they might be good candidates for proving, as there's 
not so much reason to have side effect riddled code, as one might for GUI 
programs.
