Hi Andrea:
Here you go:
/usr/local/bin/gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/inst-kernels/linux-2.4.5-pre2-aa/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -fno-strict-aliasing -pipe -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 -march=i686    -DEXPORT_SYMTAB -c sys.c
sys.c: In function `sys_gethostname':
/inst-kernels/linux-2.4.5-pre2-aa/include/asm/rwsem_xchgadd.h:51: inconsistent
operand constraints in an `asm'
I've lit fires underneath some of our gcc people, and they say it's definitely
a bug in gcc. They're currently looking at it.
David
