prio_tree with linus-mremap-simplification makes no sense to me. You
cannot avoid checking all the mm with the prio_tree and that is the only
complexity issue introduced by anonmm vs anon_vma.
prio_tree can only sit on top of anon_vma, not on top of
anonmm+linus-unshare-mremap (and yes, I cannot share
vma.shared.prio_tree_node) but pratically it's not needed for the
anon_vmas.
