No. People think you're a troll because all you've done up
till now is shout around some generic handwaving about how
other people should do stuff better.
Now if you showed us some of your work (patches, documentation,
tracing down bugs, etc...) you could convince us you're serious
about helping out improving the kernel.

Rik
