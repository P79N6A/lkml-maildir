ahem.  all new systems are going to have 128 byte NVRAMs anyway, so you
could basically keep a list of systems that have 64 bytes only.  Why
Riley's solution is bad should be pretty obvious.

You want to run this code out of userspace ? Remember the address register
is write-only and there is no way to serialize access to it out of userspace
(cli() will work after iopl(3), but is not what you want on SMP systems).

and you may not set the RTC in between.

ditto.

If you want to go into strange RTC chips, there's lots more for you:

yes.  I'd propose to do the sizing indepent of the kernel too, using either
module or command line parameters.
