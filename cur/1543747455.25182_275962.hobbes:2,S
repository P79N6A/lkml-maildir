i think i found the bug - it's an upstream ACPI bug. Does the patch
below (or the -31-19 kernel, which i've just uploaded) fix the xruns?
the upstream ACPI bug is this: we check need_resched() _before_
disabling preemption. This opens up the following scenario:
 swapper:	!need_resched()
 [IRQ context]
		wakes up a task
		marks idle task as need-resched
 swapper:	acpi_processor_idle(); // sleeps until next irq
instant 1msec latency introduced...
normally default_idle() is safe because it re-checks need_resched with
interrupts disabled before it truly halts the CPU. But
acpi_processor_idle() doesnt seem to be doing this! Your trace clearly
shows a missed preemption due to ACPI. I'm wondering why no-one has
triggered this before, it's a really bad bug that should be fixed in
2.6.10.
