Of course, if the port chosen by the client is not in the range probed by
the attacker, everything's OK. My point is that relying *only* on a port
number is a bit limitative. It is even more when some protocols only bind
to privileged source ports, or always use the same port range at boot (eg:
a router establishing a BGP connection to the ISP's router).
Please note that if I only called it "small DoS", it's clearly because
I don't consider this critical, but I think that most people involved
in security will find that DoSes based on port guessing should be
addressed when possible.
Regards,
Willy
