No, I'm worried about the case when scale is too small.  If the
per-bdi threshold becomes smaller than stat_threshold, then things
won't work, because dirty+writeback will never go below the threshold,
possibly resulting in the deadlock we are trying to avoid.
BTW, the second argument of get_dirty_limits() doesn't seem to get
used by the caller, or does it?

I realized, that it's maybe worth storing last the threshold in the
bdi as well, so that balance_dirty_pages() doesn't get woken up too
many times unnecessarilty.  But I don't know...
