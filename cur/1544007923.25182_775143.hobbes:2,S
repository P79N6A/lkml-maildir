_What_ character device nodes?  The only thing that dev_t value used to
be used for was giving contents for a text file - ..../dev in sysfs directory.  
With introduction of /sys/dev/char the damn thing got confused for
character device number *by* *device_create()*.  That's all.
There are no character device nodes at all.  Driver doesn't claim them.
Not in that call of device_create(), not anywhere else.  sysfs doesn't
create them (or any other device nodes).  If you mknod such thing as
char device and try to open it, the kernel won't go anywhere near this driver,
whether there'd been other drivers or not. 
So what kind of fundamental breakage are you talking about?  All I can see
here is a bogus entry added to bogu^Wmisguided^W /sys/dev/char, which leads
to WARN_ON() in case if somebody had char device with device number numerically
equal to that of our block device and to silent crapping into /sys/dev/char
if no such char device had been there already.
