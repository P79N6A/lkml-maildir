I still haven't found a place to send an NMI on the Geode SC1200.  I
really want one for exactly that reason.  I have been suspecting that it
gets stuck somewhere with interrupts disabled, but I can't make sense of
where that could be.  They mention something about the NMI being
implemented by SMM in their VSA.  I don't like their virtual hardware
part very much.

Hmm, one of those on the PCI bus might work.  Or perhaps the parallel
port will.  Of course if the problem is that somehow the PCI bus is
locked up, then I won't get a message anywhere since all the busses are
connected via PCI it seems.  I don't know if a PCI bus can lock up, but
for now I was assuming anything was possible.

I have asked the system on a board maker if it has jtag anywhere.  Still
waiting on the answer to that.
