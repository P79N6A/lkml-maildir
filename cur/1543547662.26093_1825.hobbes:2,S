I don't really believe that. It is as easy to add a silly NULL pointer
check based on a oops as it is after a debugging session (and it is even
likely you chose the simple fix because it is harder and more work to proceed) 
Usually with the debugger it is at least easier to collect the data needed 
for a real fix. Usually when you fix something based on oops logs you have
to often make a lot of assumptions because some knowledge is simply lost
(like, what data did that structure contain exactly where I only see the
pointer in the register?), and at least for me some of these "working theories"
have turned out wrong sometimes.

What people do is that they start thinking where they can download i386
debugging stubs ;)

That's for sure, although a single step can be sometimes very instructional
too.
