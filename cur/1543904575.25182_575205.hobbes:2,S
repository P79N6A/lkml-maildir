As far as I understand, this board has 4 interrupt lines, and they are 
mapped (by the BIOS? by Linux?) to ISA IRQs 5, 10, 11, and 12.
If I insert another 4-port NIC in the remaining slot, eth7 through eth10 
will spread to these IRQs. Correct?
Suppose 3 NICs share the same interrupt line, and each receives 1500 
packets per second. (I suppose that translates to 1500 interrupt 
requests per second.) Will the system cope with 4500 interrupt requests 
from 3 different devices on the same interrupt line? How different is it 
from 4500 interrupt requests from a single device not sharing the line?
Regards.
