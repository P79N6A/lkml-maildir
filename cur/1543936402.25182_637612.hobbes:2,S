I am not sure if it's the case. I just managed to compile a kernel in
Ubuntu myself, and I used the config file of default Ubuntu kernel, only
with a slight twist:
# CONFIG_USB_SERIAL_PL2303 is not set
Using the new kernel, I got:
[  177.916000] ehci_hcd 0000:16:00.2: irq 20, io mem 0x50002000
[  178.016000] usb 6-1: new full speed USB device using ohci_hcd and address 2

[  180.396000] usb 6-1: GSM modem (1-port) converter now attached to ttyUSB1
Also 'lsmod' told me the module 'pl2303' is not loaded. Do the dialing I
got the same problem:
[snip]
WvDial<*1>: Carrier detected.  Waiting for prompt.
WvDial<Err>: Connected, but carrier signal lost!  Retrying...
Later I will try a Ubuntu 6.04 live CD to see if the same hardware works
for 6.04 myself (previous i only read that it worked for 6.04).
