It isn't merely reducing overhead.  You can, for example,
develop better caching/readahead/swap algorithms and sometimes
get fantastic improvement.

You can break new ground with kernels too - whenever you find
new ways to use the hardware.  Kernels for massively parallel
machines aren't standardized yet, for example.
And that's the way hardware may have to go for further improvement
when it hits the final size limits.
