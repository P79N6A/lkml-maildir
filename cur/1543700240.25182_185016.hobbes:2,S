I don't think that's true. Plus, a file system (even more true in the
case of reiser4) is a huge complex beast. A driver is a lot less
complex.

Well v3 was merged too soon to, but at that time there was a big motive
to do just that - get a journalled fs in the kernel. With v4 that just
isn't the case.
I don't doubt you have great testing scripts, but nothing beats real
life testing.
