Subject: [PATCH 13/14] uml: deprecate CONFIG_MODE_TT
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/10/5/368

From: Paolo 'Blaisorblade' Giarrusso <blaisorblade@yahoo.it>
Deprecate TT mode in Kconfig so that users won't select it, update the MODE_SKAS
description (it was largely obsolete and misleadin) and btw describe advantages
for high memory usage with CONFIG_STATIC_LINK.
