Use a serial console if you want serial output. But you're not off your
rocker :)
Sysrq works fine with X here, but my system's a tad strange. I have a
Matrox Millenium, and I'm using matroxfb as well as Gerd Knorr's patch to
XF86_SVGA to do accelerated Matrox graphics with fbcon. Basically, if the
system locks up in X, I press alt-sysrq-r to change the keyboard
translation from raw mode to something sane, then alt-sysrq-k to kill the
X server, then the console messages (from sysrq, for example) overwrite my
X display. I can look at registers, tasks, memory, etc. before unmounting
and rebooting. Text scrolling is a bit slow in 1024x768 32bpp though.
