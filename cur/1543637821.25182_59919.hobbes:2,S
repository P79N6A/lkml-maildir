It's vital that you mention the kernel version you're using; some of
these problems sound like 2.5.28.

There is no easy solution for this.  Alan said we must not drop support
for serial console initialisation early on in the kernel setup, which
means before the memory subsystems are initialised.

I suspect a 2.5.28 kernel; please confirm and we'll that it from there.

I don't see there being an easy way to kill this off:
1. serial_struct is a userspace API.
2. old_serial_port glues asm/serial.h into 8250.c; asm/serial.h can't be
   changed because (mainly) ppc uses it elsewhere.  Other architectures
   seem to do the same sort of thing.
Unless ppc and others are willing to put up with major breakage when I
change asm/serial.h, I don't see this getting cleaned up.  Comments on
this area welcome.
