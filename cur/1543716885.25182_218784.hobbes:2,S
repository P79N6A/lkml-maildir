That region of memory is actually pretty tightly packed, but I think I have 
managed to solve the problem.
In drivers/pcmcia/yenta.c, it seems that the regions of memory in question 
are also too small in yenta_allocate_res() (BRIDGE_SIZE_MIN) in addition to 
not being properly aligned.  So, I added the following clause to check for 
both cases (since yenta_allocate_res() will find a new block if necessary):
        start = config_readl(socket, offset) & mask;
        end = config_readl(socket, offset+4) | ~mask;
#if 1
        if (!(type & IORESOURCE_IO) && (((end - start) < BRIDGE_SIZE_MIN) ||
            (start & (end - start))))
        {
                printk(KERN_INFO "yenta %s: Preassigned resource start %lx 
end %lx too small or not aligned.\n", socket->dev->slot_name, start, end);
                res->start = res->end = 0;
        }
        else
#endif
        if (start && end > start) {
                res->start = start;
Now everything is working perfectly, at least for me.  I realize that this 
sort of thing might break other stuff, but it seems to me that this sort of 
check is a good idea regardless.
Note that this is my first attempt at a kernel patch, so please let me know 
if this is horribly wrong or otherwise just a bad idea.
Thanks!
Alec
