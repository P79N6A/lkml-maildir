we could do this too. The reason why i picked the current "start at
SCHED_FIFO prio 49 and decrease it by 1 until it reaches 25, then stay
constant" logic is that typically the irqs registered first are 'more
important' - e.g. the timer interrupt.

well, it's called SCHED_*FIFO* for a reason :-) What might make sense is
a SCHED_LIFO policy. But, i'm not so sure it's the right thing to do:
the best work-queueing model is almost always FIFO, as it gives the best
possible fairness between equals.
Fairness also often translates into better performance, because a system
that 'fluctuates' due to LIFO often underperforms a FIFO one because
when it fluctuates towards lower load it under-utilizes the resources,
and when it fluctuates up it overloads.  LIFO makes sense for anonymous
resources like pages/slabs where LIFO allocation leads to better cache
utilization. But i'd say for non-anonymous workloads it's almost always
a loss.
