See other posting.  This is a fundamental design decision, and it's
not changing.  Sorry.

Unless the module does something else afterwards which fails and wants
to fail the init.  You're saying "don't do that", which is not a good
answer 8(
You can implement a "make_module_live()" in module.h if you want
module authors to do two-stage init manually (and trust them to get it
right).  Or you can run a notifier on "enlivening" a module: I'd hoped
to avoid that.
Hope that helps,
Rusty.
