1) working merges
2) atomic checkins of entire patches, fast tags
3) graphical 2-way merging tool like bitkeeper has
   (this might not seem essential to people who have
   never used it, but it has saved me many many hours)
4) distributed repositories
5) ability to exchange changesets by email
regards,
Rik
