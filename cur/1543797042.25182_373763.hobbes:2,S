Hi,
I've been experiencing very VERY slow boots after I've upgraded from kernel 
2.6.10 to 2.6.14.2. The boot process is fast until the start of the init 
script, after this 2.6.14.2 spends 10 seconds or so for each init task.
I was searching for answers to my problem and found this thread 
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0508.3/1741.html
 but I really 
have no clue what they are talking about.
uname -a:
Linux ravel 2.6.10 #13 SMP Thu Jul 14 00:24:03 WEST 2005 i686 Intel(R) 
Pentium(R) 4 CPU 3.40GHz GenuineIntel GNU/Linux
Please excuse if there is a better place to ask this than here. I'm not 
subscribed so please answer me directly.
thanks
Marco
