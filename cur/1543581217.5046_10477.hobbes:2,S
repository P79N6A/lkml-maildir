Following small patch fixes this and workarounds devfs related problem
which appeared in 2.4.0-test12-pre8:
	when I'm logging out, devfsd tries to state /dev/vcc/[1-6] but sometimes
	fails perhaps due to some race in kernel. As result devfsd quits with 
	error message. Retrying to state node suceeds on next attempt.
	I don't know why it happens, but I guess it's related to 
	change in drivers/char/tty_io.c between test12-pre7 and pre8
	(change to use flush_scheduled_tasks())
Hint: it seems to be easier to reproduce on slower machine (it happens seldom 
	on PIII-700, but very often on P200MMX)
