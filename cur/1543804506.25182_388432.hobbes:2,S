I never understood uptime anyway, the boot time, to the second, is 
available in /proc/stat (btime), and it isn't that hard to turn it into 
whatever format you find human readable. I have a perl script which 
presents uptime as fractional days, days, hours, min, sec, and/or boot 
time. Took me about two minutes to write.
