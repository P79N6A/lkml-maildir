Hello All,
It was recently suggested that I replace my Etherexpress adaptor
with a cheap NE2000 driver, in order to fix the problems.
Fair enough, but I still having similar problems with an ISA NE2000
card. Alan Cox once told me that the cheap set was known to be good, and
it must be an interrupt conflict problem. While I disagreed with the
interrupt conflict (nothing else uses IRQ 11), I did change the IRQ from
11 to 15. I thought it fixed the problem, but it still re-occurs.
However, with 2.2.12, I get more error information:

The Ethernet adaptor just died.
Warm rebooting didn't fix my problem. It detected the adaptor
was on IRQ 3, it is actually on IRQ 15. In addition, my PPP connection
failed to start (probably because it needed IRQ 3).
I had to cold boot (as always) to fix the problem.
Any ideas? I seem to be having lots of networking problems lately.
It would be really nice if I could fix just 1...
Also, another point, with Etherexpress I get messages like:
Sep 14 15:51:31 share kernel: eth0: tx interrupt but no status
but with my NE2000 adaptor, I get messages like
Sep 28 08:45:10 snoopy kernel: eth0: unexpected TX-done interrupt, lasttx=20.
These look very similar to me. Both computers are completely different,
the only thing in common is that there are both 486. 
Coincidence?
