I'd be inclined to change request_module to take multiple arguments, but still 
to leave it defined as a NOP in the !CONFIG_KMOD case. That way, all the code 
gets cleaned up, but you don't incur the extra function call cost. 
I appreciate that the cost of that function call isn't exactly high - but it's 
not exactly necessary either. When you change to/from CONFIG_KMOD, you expect 
to have to recompile some files. It's not the end of the world. 
Except in exceptional cases, run-time performance is far more important than
compilation time, surely?
