I'm running kde, mutt, mozilla, make -j5 kernel compile on a loop for the
last coupld days.  I wasn't using this much address space with the same work
load yesterday, so that's why I think there is a bug there.  
Although, I seem to recall running the same compile loop on a larger system
(2x666 mhz p3 512mb ram, vnc, no local Xserver) on a previous (2.4.18-rc-ac)
kernel without any other patches. 
This machine is a 350 p2 with 128mb ram.
