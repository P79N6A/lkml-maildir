Excellent. This immediately shows another bug in the code.

The code (some version of 2.6.0-test6) says
	if (atkbd->translated) do {
		if (atkbd->emul != 1) {
			if (code == ATKBD_RET_ACK)
				break;
			...
		}
		if (code < 0x80) {
			code = atkbd_unxlate_table[code];
			break;
		}
		code = atkbd_unxlate_table[code & 0x7f];
	}
Here an e0 preceded, setting the atkbd->emul flag.
Now the acknowledge for the 0xed command was not recognized as
ATKBD_RET_ACK and untranslated as if it were a keystroke.
Yes, I hope to convince Vojtech that untranslating is evil.
The question is: what to do with a protocol scancode?
My answer from long ago was: view it as a protocol scancode only
when it is expected - after we send a command we expect an ACK.
And indeed, 2.4 still has
	if (reply_expected) {
		if (scancode == KBD_REPLY_ACK) {
			acknowledge = 1;
			reply_expected = 0;
	...
That is, the right way, or at least the way that worked since 1.1.54,
is to test only for KBD_REPLY_ACK when we just sent something.
The wrong solution follows below (not compiled or tested):

(This is right for the great majority of people that does not
have fa,fe occur as non-protocol scancodes. In rare cases
some more surgery is needed. Left to Vojtech.)
