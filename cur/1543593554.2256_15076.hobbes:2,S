Never noticed it until now. Very nice patch :-) I have to agree as well.
It would be nice if we had 
1) A seperate serial directory under drivers.
2) A nice structure that input devices and the tty layer can use. It is
   just a waste to go threw the tty layer for input devices. It would also
   make serial driver writing easier if the api is designed right :-)
