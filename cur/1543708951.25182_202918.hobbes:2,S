This is used for accessing "normal" disks on beasts with byte-swapped IDE
bus (Atari/Q40/TiVo) and "byteswapped" disks on normal machines.
[ Hm. actually I don't see how it can be used for accessing "normal" disks,
  as data is byteswapped by IDE bus and then swapped back by IDE driver. ]
Manfred noticed the same issue some time ago:
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0201.0/0768.html
but discussion ended without final conclusion.
I like Alan's idea to use loopback instead of "bswap".

I think something similar has been already done
(grep for insw_swapw/outsw_swapw in ide-iops.c and asm-m68k/ide.h).
