Very interesting...
It boots fine from ext2 on IDE here.  Do you have any oddities in
.config? (e.g. something silly enabled - CONFIG_PREEMPT, etc.)
Bug looks very odd.  -EFAULT from mount(2) done by a thread that
runs with equivalent of set_fs(KERNEL_DS)...
.config might be really useful.  Or not - it may boil down to checking
which path it actually takes and where does -EFAULT come from.
