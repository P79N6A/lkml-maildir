Hah...  Replying to my own message like a newbie :-/
I just found an error:

This actually _wont_work_, as this is the _parent_ death signal (which
_we_ receive when our _parent_ dies).  So, while using
prctl(PR_SET_PDEATH_SIG,...) is a good way to initiate cleanup when a
multithreaded app is killed (which, BTW, solves the kill -9 problem),
there's no way we can change the signal our _parent_ would get when _we_
die (and a good thing that is too: I believe it would have been useful to
escape certain kinds of limited-execution traps...)
