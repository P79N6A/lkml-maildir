Subject: [PATCH 3/12] get_unmapped_area handles MAP_FIXED on arm
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

ARM already had a case for MAP_FIXED in arch_get_unmapped_area() though
it was not called before. Fix the comment to reflect that it will now
be called.
