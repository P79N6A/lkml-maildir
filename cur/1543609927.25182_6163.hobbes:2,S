It _does_ fail to mount the filesystem as ext3, and the ext2 code properly
mounts it.  You can see this because the error message you got (in your
previous posting said "EXT2-fs: ..." so the error came from ext2.
Please run e2fsck (1.25) to clear this up.  It may be that you have other
corruption in your filesystem.  If you are sure you _never_ tried ext3
on this filesystem before, yet the has_journal bit is set, this could
be an indication of memory or cable problems.
Cheers, Andreas
