Whereas I agree that NFSv4 could use some of this (I'm mainly interested
in the intent_release() stuff in order to fix up an existing race), I
also agree with Christoph on the principle that having in-tree users
right from the start should be the norm rather than the exception.
Otherwise, exactly what is the plan for how to determine when an
interface is obsolete? Are we going to rely on all the out-of-tree
vendors to collectively step up and say "by the way - we're not using
this anymore."?
Cheers,
