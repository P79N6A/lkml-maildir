Subject: My USB pendrive broke in 2.6.1

Something in the USB storage code, the FAT code or the SCSI code changed
between 2.6.0 and 2.6.1 to break my USB pendrive. Under 2.6.0 I had no problems
mounting and accessing the drive, but after a move to 2.6.1, this is what appears
in dmesg:
request_module: failed /sbin/modprobe -- block-major-2-0. error = 256
hub 1-0:1.0: new USB device on port 2, assigned address 4

0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 
end_request: I/O error, dev sda, sector 32
FAT: unable to read boot sector
I'm not sure what other information to provide on this issue, but I'm certain
that it worked under 2.6.0 - I'm going to check that ASAP. The drive works under
WinXP, so the unit itself is OK.
Does anyone have any ideas on what I should do next?
TIA
Brad
