Look again, drive_stat_acct is also called for list merges (just with 0
set for new i/o of course).

The size of requests will typically vary with the block size set by
ext2. So if you have 1kB block size on your fs, that partition will
receive 1kB buffers. Similar for 4kB. The stats collected in the kernel
are sector based, units of 512 bytes. The proc printed value should be
in kB however for pgpin/out and 512b sectors for rio/rblk wio/wblk.
