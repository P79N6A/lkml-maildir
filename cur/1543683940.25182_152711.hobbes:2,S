Subject: [PATCH] automate patch names in kernel versions
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Perhaps times have changed enough that I can revive this idea from a
few years ago:

This four-line patch provides a means for listing what patches have
been built into a kernel. This will help track non-standard kernel
versions, such as those released by Redhat, or Alan's ac series, etc.
more easily.
With this patch in place, each new patch can include a file of the
form "patchname.[identifier]" in the top level source directory and
[identifier] will then be added to the kernel version string. For
instance, Alan's ac patches could include a file named patchdesc.ac2
(containing a change log, perhaps), and the resulting kernel would be
identified as 2.2.0-pre6+ac2, both at boot and by uname.
This may prove especially useful for tracking problems with kernels
built by distribution packagers and problems reported by automated
tools.

The patch now appends patches as -name rather than +name to avoid
issues that might exist with packaging tools and scripts.
