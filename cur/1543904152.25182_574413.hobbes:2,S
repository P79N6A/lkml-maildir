PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE fix your mailer.
None of your patches are apply-able via script or patch(1), which is how 
all Linux maintainers apply patches.
If you want to contribute to the kernel, you -must- figure out how to 
send patches via email.
Linux kernel development is done almost exclusively through email, so it 
is very important to get the details right.
