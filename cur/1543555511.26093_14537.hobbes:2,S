	Question about /proc/partitions and LVM.  LVM devices in 
/proc/partitions currently show up as lvma, lvmb, etc, depending on
their device number.  This breaks things like mount by filesystem
name.  Back when LVM existed as a patch, I believe there was some
support in fs/partitions/check.c for showing the proper name for
the device (something like <vgname>/<lvname>).  
	Are their any plans for something like this to be added
or is their a reason it was taken out?
	BTW, 2.4.0-test11 is the first "perfect" kernel for me.  It
finally has everything I use working correctly.  (well, with a 
small raid5 patch, anyway).
