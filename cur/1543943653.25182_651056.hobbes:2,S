Thomas,
I haven't found a good way to capture the SysRq output for this. I
found that when it locks up at boot time, even SysRq is unresponsive.
I don't have another way of getting console on the machine right now
to get the output off of it. I have since upgraded to 2.6.24 and the
problem still persists.
Another interesting twist though.. I just rebuilt my kernel with
ARCH=x86_64 and HPET works perfectly. So this only appears to break
when in 32-bit mode. For some reason it picks tsc at boot time, but if
I install hpet afterwards under x86_64 it no longer hangs when I run
'sleep 1'. Does that shed any more light on the problem?
Thanks,
-Andrew
