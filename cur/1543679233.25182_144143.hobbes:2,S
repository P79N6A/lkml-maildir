I used to do something like that.  It became awfully inconvenient, so I...

...now use a single "/" filesystem on most systems, with a tiny
"/boot" one to ensure booting.  With journalling, this risk of losing
data this way is much lower than it used to be, and the old reason for
using multiple partitions - to avoid having to fsck /usr - no longer applies.

So you have as much space unpartitioned on your disks as you are
actually using to store data?  I generally don't.
