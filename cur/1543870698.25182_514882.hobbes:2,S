If you have a known-working kernel version, git-bisect might help you
track down where it was introduced. Given the messages prior to the
hugetlbpage.c BUG_ON I'd say that this is something else besides the
specific code listed by line number, though I wouldn't rule out hugetlb
having tripped over itself before the actual BUG.
