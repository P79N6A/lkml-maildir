You can't sucessfully load a module from tasklet because tasklet's run
in softirq. You need to use a work queue (or other mechanism) that runs
in process context. Loading a module will require accessing disk, and that
can only be done from process context.
Your whole scheme is pretty daft, because it will be slow and you might
as well have the module already loaded.
