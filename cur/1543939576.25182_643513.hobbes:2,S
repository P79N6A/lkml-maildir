Right. I assumed that Linus was calling mkinitrd but was being bitten by
one of the occasional assumptions (I believe we make in that script)
that certain things are always modular. I just mailed the maintainer,
suggesting we screen against the one of the Modules.* files (perhaps
Modules.order might become a good candidate in due course...).
