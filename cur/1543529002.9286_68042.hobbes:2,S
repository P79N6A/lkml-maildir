Subject: [BUG] 2.3.50 no longer allows regular user to bind unix-domain sockets

Between 2.3.50-pre2 and 2.3.50 something changed that caused everything
run as my regular user to fail when binding Unix-domain sockets.
I suspect a change to `linux/fs/namei.c' is responsible, where it
introduces (as far as I can tell) a new check for CAP_MKNOD before
allowing the creation of Unix domain sockets.
If this is a local configuration issue, please let me know, but I didn't
make any changes but the kernel at the time -- and pre2 (which I am back
on now) works just fine.
