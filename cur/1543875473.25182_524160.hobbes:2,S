Yes, the whole input is like this so I keep it consistent.
Regarding the synaptics driver and scroll problem. Yesterday I
scrolled twice through entire Remarque's "Spark of Life" off lib.ru
(once with 0.14.2 and once with latest git pull) and did not see any
scrollbar getting "stuck". Could it be newer xorg problem instead of
individual driver problem? I am using whatever xorg was installed in
FC3 which is somewhat dated... Also, could it be that the scroll issue
happens only in a certain application?
