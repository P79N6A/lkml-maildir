It's kinda fun playing Brian along like this ;)
One option is to just stick the thing in an existing lib/ or kernel/ file
and mark it __attribute__((weak)).  That way architectures can override it
for free with no ifdefs, no Makefile trickery, no Kconfig trickery, etc.
attribute(weak) is creepily useful - I keep waiting for something to go
wrong with it.
