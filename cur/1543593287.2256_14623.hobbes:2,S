 There is a small difference in interrupt delivery between i8259A and I/O
APIC configurations.  An I/O APIC incurs a slightly larger delivery
latency, both for asserts and for deasserts.  You need to be prepared for
it in the driver, especially for the latter case, i.e. send an IRQ ack
early to the device, so there is enough time for a message to go through
the inter-APIC bus.  Otherwise you risk spurious interrupts.
