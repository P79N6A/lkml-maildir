Hi, robert 
One customer reported that their system received a nmi interrupt after
issuing "dd if=/dev/sdb of=/dev/null" on a defective disk in rhel4u6.
I tested it and found  that my system hung both in rhel4u6(2.6.9-67) and
2.6.24-rc7.
The patch can work well,  but I am not sure if the patch has other
potential effect on adma.
I attached a  file in case of lines breaked.
The below info comes from Gunther Mayer to reproduce the issue.
"
used a Seagate ST3500841NS 3.AE for my test; probably other 
seagate drives are also capable of creating media errors with 
the new hdparm-8.1: 
- compile hdparm-8.1 
- hdparm -- yes-i-know-what-i-am-doing --make-bad-sector 60000 /dev/sdb 
Unfortunately this does not succeed for nvidia sata controller (timeouts
et al.), but it worked fine on AHCI machine (e.g. FSC R640). 
When I insert this newly created defective disk in Ultra 20, 
it reboots within seconds after issueing "dd if=/dev/sdb of=/dev/null".
