It can for another reason - score-boarding: that's where a byte being
stored assumes intermediate values due to the bits not being set
simultaneously. Generally this doesn't cause a problem because data across
processors is serialised for update by mutexes. However, when applied to
code all sorts of interesting instructions can execute before the bits
settle down. I haven't heard of this troubling Intel, but it does occur on
some current architectures.
