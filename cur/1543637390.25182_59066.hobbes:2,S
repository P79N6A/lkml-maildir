It is from the Greek
	a -- not
	tomos -- cuttable
I think it was Aristotle who theorized the existance of the
atom.  He described it by discussing an apple.  You can cut
an apple in half. each piece you can cut in half again.
Eventually you would get to a piece, invisibly small, that
could not be cut in half.  That was his atom.
Of course scientists assigned the term to something that
could indeed be split.  Of course you know what happens when
you split the atom...
In programming we describe as atomic any action that cannot
be split (a read(2) from a serial device cannot return just 3
bits) or an action containing multiple sub-actions that if
split/interrupted causes breakage.  If you interrupt an
atomic_* it will set of a chain reaction and the OS will
explode :)

The terms foo, bar, foobar, sna, etc in psuedocode stand for
"something having a name" We use them in places where the
actual name doesn't matter for the sake of the discussion.
The "good replacer words" can often be almost-real or
unintentially real name and cause confusion or divert the
functional discussion into a discussion (argument) over
names.  They are sometimes also used to mean "you make up a
name that has meaning for your purpose".
Once in a while though FUBAR and SNAFU are used in their
classic naval-derived sense.  such as when a certain POTUS
told the world that a grave government agency error was a
SNAFU implying that such erros were "Situation Normal".
