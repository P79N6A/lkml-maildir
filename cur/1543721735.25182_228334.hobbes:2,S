If it's undistributable, it obviously doesn't belong in main. So please
remove the undistributable stuff. Second, if it's non-free, it doesn't
belong in the kernel, which is in main. So remove anything that is
non-free from the kernel-source. It's really not rocket science, and I
don't know why people insist upon talking about collective versus
derivative works, because none of this stuff belongs in main anyway.
If you need help in determining whether something is free or not, please send 
a message to debian-legal (preferably in a new thread) asking that question.
