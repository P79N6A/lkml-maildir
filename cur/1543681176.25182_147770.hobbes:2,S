A few things have changed since PID_MAX_DEFAULT
was set to 0x8000. It's now adjustable via the
/proc/sys/kernel/pid_max file. An app, /bin/ps,
now reads this file to determine column width
for PID, PPID, PGID, SESS, LWP, and so on.
The common-case Linux box is best served by a
value that keeps /bin/ps PID columns narrow,
allowing for more space elsewhere. The following
patch gives 4-digit PID values as a default.
