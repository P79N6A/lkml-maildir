What is this resume failed case?
If it means the machine has crashed during resume, then so what? The
key is not on disk in the clear -ever- in the dm-crypt case. If the
attacker gets to poke around in the memory contents of the crashed
machine for the key (or the partially loaded suspend image).
If it means we fell back to a normal boot, normal boot can simply dd
over the swap at boot, generate a new ephemeral swap key, or whatever.

Any sensible solution here is going to require remembering passwords.
And arguably anywhere the user needs encrypted suspend, they'll want
encrypted swap as well.
