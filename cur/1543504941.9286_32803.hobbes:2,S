IIRC you need a newer version of info - it works in mine.  I aliased
info='xemacs -nw -q -f info' long ago anyway.  Then I can view info pages
that aren't in my directory node too (is there a way to do this with info?
info cipe tells me there's no such info page whereas xemacs -q -f info
cipe displays it, for example).
