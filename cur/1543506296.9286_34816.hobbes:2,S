WHy should the list software have to deal with setups such as that
when sensible anti-spam requirements imply that mail should only be
accepted from the address it is to be sent out to?
Or hadn't you realised that what you described above is one of the
recognised signs of a spammer, and will get your account listed in
domain killfiles fairly rapidly.
I would presume you're doing it that way so you can separate out
different mailing lists into different folders, but you're just
creating unnecessary hassle for yourself. Have a look at procmail,
and set it up to do the splitting for you, based on one of the
following header lines, listed in descending order of preference:
 1. Maillist processor specific:
	"^MD-Maillist:"
	"^X-Maillist:"
 2. Generic:
	"^Sender:"
	"^X-Sender:"
 3. Last resort:
	"^From "
Note that the last one does NOT have a : on the end, but a space, and
that IS important as there is a DIFFERENT header line that has the
colon on it as well. Also, the quotes are NOT part of the pattern, but
the ^ anchor is.
 >> The first line states the email address I wish to be known as,
 >> and the second states the account I actually used to send that

 > But not everybody does it that way ;)
Clearly the case, but if people wish to cause themselves problems,
I for one see no need to dissuade them from doing so.
Best wishes from Riley.
