As someone else has pointed out, if the stack doesn't grow down, then
it not so easy to make the stack and the heap grow towards each
other.
Right now, I like the stack being mapping a little under the
application and having the ability to grown down as required...
truthfully though, in a true 64-bit architecture (you didn't say one
way or the other), i.e. not contained by a 4GB memory limitation,
this is probably a non-issue.
