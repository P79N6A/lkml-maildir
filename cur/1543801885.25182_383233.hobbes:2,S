Another very common situation is a system which fails to boot due to
failures to find the root filesystem. This can happen because of device name
slippage, root disk not being found, the proper HBA driver isn't present in
the initrd image, etc. The customer calls us and reports the last thing they
see on the screen:
    Mounting root filesystem
    Kmod : failed to exec /sbin/modprobe -s -k block-major-8 , error = 2
    mount : error 6 mounting ext3
    pivotroot : pivot_root(/sysroot,.sysroot/initrd) failed : 2
    Freeing unused memory
    Kernel panic : No init found . Try passing init= option to kernel
Great! Only problem is the info we really need has already scrolled of the
screen. An option to pause briefly after each boot time printk would be very
useful.
