Well.. u64 vs unsigned long *is* binary incompatible, but it is
similar enough that it is going to be compatible at source level, or
maybe userland app will need *minor* ifdefs... That's better than two
completely different versions...

No, it is probably not possible to take code from BSD kernel and "just
port it". But keeping same/similar userland interface would be nice.
