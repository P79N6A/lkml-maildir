Subject: [PATCH] preempt-kernel on 2.4.19-pre2-ac2 bugfix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The same schedule_tail bug affecting 2.5 affects 2.4 with O(1).  I.e.,
2.4.19-pre2-ac2.
In recent O(1) scheduler releases, an optimization was made that removed
schedule_tail from UP kernels.  This causes the initial preempt_count of
a new task, which starts at 1, to never decrement to zero and thus never
become preemptible.  CONFIG_PREEMPT requires schedule_tail, too.
Users of 2.4+O(1)+preempt (i.e. -ac) should use this patch:

instead.  Thanks to everyone who pointed out the lousy performance.  Enjoy,
	Robert Love
