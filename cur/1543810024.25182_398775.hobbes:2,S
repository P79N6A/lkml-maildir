No, I wasn't arguing that it should be okay to unplug a usb drive while 
the system is suspended, I was saying that it is better for the kernel 
to assume you did not when it can't really tell, since you aren't 
supposed to do that anyhow.

   But there _IS_ a difference between power loss and actual unplug, so 
I very well can say one is allowed and the other is not.  The fact that 
the kernel can not tell the difference is simply a limitation that must 
be dealt with.
