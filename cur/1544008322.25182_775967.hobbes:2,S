The title of their proposal was "client"... as in not the local
filesystem, but the impression of what wine really wanted is
for local linux filesystems to implement these non-posix behaviors
so "wine apps can run just like on windows" on the local machine.
Thus the strong objection from everyone doing local filesystems.
Passing exclusive DENYREAD DENYWRITE DENYDELETE network
protocol flags from a linux client to a remote server
is an entirely different and IMO acceptible thing.
And AFAIK on unix the only local support would be by doing
a client-on-server loopback, where the server implements
these modes as best it can and you are only protected
against wine apps that are also inside the "share drive".
