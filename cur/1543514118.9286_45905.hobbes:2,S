Addition/Removal of devices after the kernel has booted shouldn't be
an issue. At worst a daemon could be added to monitor this sort of
thing with the data tables held in userspace.
At best, pciutils could be extended. Though I am unfamiliar with
such devices, I don't think pciutils would even need any extra code
to identify recently added devices, as the bus is scanned every time
it is run.
regards,
Dave.
