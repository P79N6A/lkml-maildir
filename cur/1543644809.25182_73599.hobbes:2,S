I got some pretty nasty results with that patch. After enabling the dir_index 
superblock flag and running e2fsck -fD, the filesystem would spontaneously 
remount itself read-only (I have errors=remount-ro set) after a few minutes 
of use. Once I disabled dir_index, e2fsck picked up many duplicate blocks. 
There doesn't appear to be any severe filesystem damage, however.
