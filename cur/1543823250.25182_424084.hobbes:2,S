I still very much dislike this patch because it is creating
1 more clone per packet than is actually necessary and that
is very expensive.
dev_queue_xmit_nit() is going to clone whatever SKB you send into
there, so better to just bump the reference count (with skb_get())
instead of cloning or copying.
