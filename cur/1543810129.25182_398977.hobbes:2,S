You wouldn't believe the problems we had with kernel_thread followed by
call_usermodehelper() due to inheritance of random stuff from the userspace

A suitable solution is to stop using kernel_thread(), migrate to the
kthread API - that way the threads are parented by keventd which is a known
and good environment.
