open(2), not open64(2) ! This is correct behaviour.

If they worked it was bug.

You need only one define: -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64. It'll force GlibC to
use alias open64 to open (and off_t will be 8 bytes long, of course).
90% (if not 99%) of programs will work just fine with this define but
there are few who do not (RPM 3.x, for example: RPM playing durty tricks
with libio and failes miserable with such define).
