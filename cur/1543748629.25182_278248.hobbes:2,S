Yes, i recently find it out when trying to switch all my system to
UTF-8. But the patch from Chris you mention below works very well
for me (and for anybody that needs to type compose characters for
languages based in the latin1 encoding i guess).

Spanish ;))

Chris told me in the utf-8 mailing list that he doesn't think his patch to
make the kernel generate UTF-8 characters in the compose tables will be
included in the main kernel. Basically because is not a full solution that
cover all the cases... But there is nothing better, so maybe it will be a
good idea to include it. Current state is, for 2.6 kernel, text console
is broken in UTF-8 mode because it cannot generate UTF-8 composed characters.

At least, I am _really_ interested :)
