You don't have to. However, if you don't align the zone, you have to
still offset a lot of the calculations by the "alignment factor". Which
bacially means that you in practice _do_ end up aligning it after all,
it's just that you're doing it at run-time instead of setup-time. No
real difference, and doing it at setup is clearer I think.
