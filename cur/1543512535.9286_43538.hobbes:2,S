Looks good.

That can be fixed another way --- it is relatively simple to drop the
semaphore while we read the page from disk and revalidate the page fault
context when we unblock again.  A sequence number against vma list
changes plus a double-check against the contents of the pte would be
sufficient here.  If the context has changed, we can just return: we'll
get another page fault from scratch, and the page will already be in
cache. 
We already have to do part of this work anyway because every time we
block while processing a write fault, we have to double-check to see if
the swapper removed the pte while we were asleep.
