Well, it's perhaps not needed for slave transfers as such. But the MMC
driver (and I suspect quite a few other users of the slave interface)
deals with scatterlists, so it needs a way to keep track of all the
descriptors it submits. Hence the list node.
But looking at your latest patch series, I guess we can use the new
"next" field instead. It's not like we really need the full
capabilities of list_head.
