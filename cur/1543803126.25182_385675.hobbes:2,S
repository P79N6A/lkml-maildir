Subject: RT question : softirq and minimal user RT priority

Hi,
	I was testing 2.6.15-rt3. During my tests, I tried to run a program which made a loop at
RT priority 10 and 30.
I was very happy to see that after the tests, I can't use any command except those already in memory.
My filesystems were in read-only after the test. I was unable to shutdown the machine : 
top => command not found
<CTRL><ALT><DEL> => INIT: cannot execute "/sbin/shutdown"
/sbin/reboot   => Input/Output error
I had to push the reset button.
My questions are : 
Did I find a bug ?
Is the smallest usable real-time priority greater than the highest real-time softirq ?
In this case could we forbid priority lesser than the highest softirq priority ?
