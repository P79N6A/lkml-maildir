Hello Linux Kernel Listees
I feel a little guilty posting this question here but frustration
has driven me to do so. Does anyone know where to get info on
fbcon besides that in /usr/src/linux/Documentation/fb. I need
to know the basics of how to get fbcon working and how to use
it to simply set video modes.
Thanks for any assistance,
Daniel
