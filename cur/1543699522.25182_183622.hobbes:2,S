Yes, please do add that Inactive: line to rmap. :)

But I should count it as "Inactive" right?
So, if it's clean, then the page has already been zeroed out, and is ready
to be used but just needs some flags updated?  Or they contain possibly
useful data, and just are not dirty?  So a page that is inactive, but not
dirty will go directly in that list?
What can happen to Inact_clean pages besides being freed, and used on the
free memory list?
