Thanks.  But I was just fooling with it again just now, trying to get
the networking to work (and failing miserably, ping losses are circa
70%) by resetting the MTU to 1492 like the rest of my system is
forced into by the DSL overhead.  I've changed the *only* 1500 that
was 'grep'able in the whole /etc tree, which is in
/etc/sysconfig/networking-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 to a MTU=1492 and have
restarted the networking several times without effecting the change.
ISTR I added that MTU statement to that file earlier, but at 1492,
how it got reset to 1500, damnifIknow.
It got my attention that even though the default inittab setting is
for runlevel 2, it is not even attempting to start the Xserver now,
giving me a root login right on the terminal, and a startx fails
because it cannot A find a screen now, and B find a usb mouse I just
plugged in because the ps2 mouse was such a dawg.  The mouse works
just fine when that same machine is booted to FC3RC3.  And the
networking doesn't work there either, same symptoms.  The yellow led
on the interface jack is blinking rapidly.  NDI what that means.
