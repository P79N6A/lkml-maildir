One could play with updatedb followed by a memhog.  How much time passes
and how many slab objects have to be freed before the memhog has
allocated N% of physical memory?  Both numbers are relevant.  The first
indicates how quickly pages are reclaimed from slab caches, while the
second show how many objects remain cached for future lookups.  Updatedb
aside, caching objects is done for solid performance reasons.
Creating a qemu image with little memory and a huge directory hierarchy
filled with 0-byte files may be a nice test system.  Unless you beat me
to it I'll try to set it up once logfs is in merge-worthy shape.
