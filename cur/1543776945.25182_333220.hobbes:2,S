Based on the proposed users of this fs, I don't see any.  What ones are
you saying are not "debug" type operations?  And yes, I consider LTT a
"debug" type operation :)
The best part of this, is it gives distros and users a consistant place
to mount the fs, and to know where this kind of thing shows up in the fs
namespace.
