That won't work, of course - while the PS/2 and keyboard ports are the
same, they are master/slave - the computer is master and the device is
slave - you cannot connect master to master.
It'd work if you used bitbanging on the parallel port, though.
Or a keyboard with something heavy on the 'esc' key ;)
Another possibility is just to remove the BIOS from the card or tell the
on-board BIOS not to initalize it.
