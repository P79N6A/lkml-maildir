I jumped into this discussion on linux-arm-kernel before realizing
it had wandered here.
I don't see the major 204 allocation in devices.txt, so I'm not sure if
this has already been covered, but it would be nice to have an allocation
for "on-chip UARTs" in system-on-chip type configurations.  I recently
worked on a port to the Cirrus Logic EP7211, which is an ARM-based
system-on-chip (CPU, UARTs, LCD controller, DRAM controller, etc.)
It seems hoggish to ask for an allocation for such a non-general-purpose
piece of hardware.
If we had (say) 4 or 8 on-chip UART device numbers for regular serial,
plus a corresponding 4 or 8 for serial IR using the same UARTs, that
would cover things nicely (EP7211 has only 2 UARTs but I figure it'll be
good to leave some room).  And on-chip UARTs are by definition mutually
exclusive (unless you start talking about sharing /dev via NFS between
heterogeneous embedded systems).
