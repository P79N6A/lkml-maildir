The only issue I see here is that is_big_kernel is actually wrong, the
correct logic should be:
if ((end && end > 0xc0c00000) ||
    (!is_big_kernel && sys_size > DEF_SYSSIZE))
Not that it matters much, but it's correct that way.
I would also feel a lot happier if this was actually defined
symbolically somewhere, and there was a comment connecting it to head.S.
Alternative I could take a stab at making these tables auto-generated
and therefore completely eliminate this dependency for bzImage.
