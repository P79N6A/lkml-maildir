Don't use static zones then.
Something I talked about with Linus a while back was to separate memory
into 4MB or 16MB zones, and do allocation not from individual zones but
from zone lists.  Then you just keep track of two lists of zones: one
which contains zones which are known to have been used for non-pagable
allocations, and another in which all allocations are pagable.  
The pagable-allocation zone family can always be used for large
allocations: you just select a contiguous region of pages which aren't
currently being used by the contiguous allocator, and page them out (or
relocate them to a different zone if you prefer).
If this is only needed by device initialisation, the relocation doesn't
have to be fast.  A dumb, brute-force search (such as is already done by
sys_swapoff()) will do fine.
