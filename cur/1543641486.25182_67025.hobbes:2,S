etc.
Floppy has many more problems.
Repeadedly loading and unloading the floppy.o module corrupts
sys_device data structures.
Writing to floppy can give ENOSPC errors even though space exists.
Writing to floppy can OOPS the kernel due to a NULL pointer error.
VFS-over-floppy corrupts data since 2.5.13.
Putting lilo on ext2 on floppy can cause a kernel hang due to an
infinite loop of "buffer layer error".
I have a patch which fixes the {,un}register_sys_device() bugs, NULL
queue bug, zero i_size bug, and fixes read/write enough that raw media
access (e.g. tar or dd to/from /dev/fd0) works. It's in the 2.5-dj tree,
and separately in <
http://www.csd.uu.se/~mikpe/linux/patches/2.5/>.
I havent' pushed this to Linus since it's meaningless as long as
the VFS data corruption exists. It was broken by blkdev/VFS changes,
but those responsible haven't yet bothered to repair it.
