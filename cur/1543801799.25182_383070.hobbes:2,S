Subject: sanitized kernel headers

Hello,
almost two years ago, a decision has been made that raw kernel headers 
are for the kernel only, and that userspace should be built against some 
"sanitized" kernels. Linux-Libc-Headers 
(
http://ep09.pld-linux.org/~mmazur/linux-libc-headers/
) were one of the 
implementations of such sanitized headers, and they worked well and were 
used e.g. in Linux From Scratch.
But now, the Linux-Libc-Headers project looks dead: no commits in the 
SVN for the last two months, and the only changes in SVN as compared to 
LLH 2.6.12.0 are addition of inotify.h, removal of some kernel-only 
headers and some minor fix for non-glibc systems.
What is the recommended (non-dead) alternative implementation of such 
"sanitized" headers? Where is the roadmap for this area?
