It should be fixed in VM-global-patch-2. Main issue was kpiod.
I released a few minutes ago 2.2.17pre11aa1 that also have some more VM
stuff into it. I'd like if people could try it and tell me what they
thinks about the VM behaviour. It merges VM-global-patch-2 and all the
other few stuff is completly orthogonal with VM-global-patch-2.
