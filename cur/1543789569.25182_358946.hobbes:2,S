I think the coalescing is really done by the resolution rounding.  There will always be the list 
removal overhead, but short of a duplex tree (i.e. one entry per time with dup times linked from the 
first (Ug)) you will always have that.  What you want to coalesce is the interrupt overhead, not the 
list overhead, the former being MUCH larger.  The difference here is that we don't see the 
resolution reflected in the tree structure, but that, I think, is good.
