Hi,
m32r_sio
--------
Maintainer: Hirokazu Takata
Please clean up the m32r_sio driver, removing whatever bits of code
aren't absolutely necessary.
Specifically, I'd like to see the following addressed:
- the usage of SERIAL_IO_HUB6
  (this driver doesn't support hub6 cards)
- SERIAL_IO_* should be UPIO_*
- __register_m32r_sio, register_m32r_sio, unregister_m32r_sio,
  m32r_sio_get_irq_map
  (this driver doesn't support PCMCIA cards, all of which are based on
   8250-compatible devices.)
- early_serial_setup
  (should we really have the function name duplicated across different
   hardware drivers?)
au1x00_uart
-----------
Maintainer: unknown (akpm - any ideas?)
This is a complete clone of 8250.c, which includes all the 8250-specific
structure names.
Specifically, I'd like to see the following addressed:
- Please clean this up to use au1x00-specific names.
- this driver is lagging behind with fixes that the other drivers are
  getting.  Is au1x00_uart actually maintained?
- the usage of UPIO_HUB6
  (this driver doesn't support hub6 cards)
- __register_serial, register_serial, unregister_serial
  (this driver doesn't support PCMCIA cards, all of which are based on
   8250-compatible devices.)
- early_serial_setup
  (should we really have the function name duplicated across different
   hardware drivers?)
The main reason is I wish to kill off uart_register_port and
uart_unregister_port, but these drivers are using it.
Thanks.
