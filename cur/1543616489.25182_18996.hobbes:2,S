Oh, nice observation.  writeout_one_page could be trashed at
the same time (but not waitfor_one_page, still in use elsewhere).
But what's the chance that an out-of-tree filesystem might
be using generic_buffer_fdatasync, which is still prototyped
and exported?  Remove from 2.5 but leave in 2.4?  I'd like to
see them go completely - revenge for being misled by them -
but Marcelo may decide otherwise.

I'm not entirely convinced (you'll agree that the argument
depends on rather more than you've stated there), but today
I cannot support the counter-example I thought I had (a page
already "on its way out": but we're more careful to hold both
pagecache_lock and page lock when checking page count before
removing from inode cache than I remembered).
(Hmm, but if it's all thoroughly protected, why do we even bother
to recheck mapping and index same there?  Perhaps the shmem case.)
I was also overlooking that the lru_cache_del call was added into
page_cache_release to cope with the _anonymous_ pages Linus put
on LRU.  Cached pages were and are deleted from LRU before getting
there, and __find_lock_page_helper applies to cached not anon pages.
So I agree, both parts of my patch are unnecessary:
harmless, but no justification for applying it.

That makes a lot of sense: but I feel much safer in agreeing
with you than in making the corresponding changes!
Many thanks for looking it over,
Hugh
