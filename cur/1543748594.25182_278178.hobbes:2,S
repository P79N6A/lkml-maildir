Hi Ingo,  I found the problem! and I now know why John Cooper didn't
have this problem too.  I have CONFIG_PCI_MSI defined. I don't know why,
I must have seen the option a while ago and said to myself "That looks
cool, lets try it". Since I started with the config file of the vanilla
kernel with your rt patches, it was still on. 
Anyways, what is happening is that the io_apic code is mapping irqs to
vectors, and your code didn't account for it. So here's my patch.

--------------------
I also removed the comment "!CONFIG_SMP" since it really wasn't correct.
So I can get back to looking at other things.  This also may explain why
my system would hang with my usb printer attached (the usb interrupts
were vectored too).  I'll plug my printer back in and see if it works
now. I'll let you know if I have any more problems.
Thanks,
