doing a mount <address>:/dir /mount_point generates the following noisy
error messages:
kmem_create: Forcing size word alignment - nfs-fh
also, the rpc.lockd program is reporting an error when invoked from the
System V init startup scripts:
lockd: lockdsvc: invalid argument 
during system initialization with init 2.78.  
The radio-miropcm20.o driver reports 3 unresolved externals (apm_
functions) and fails with depmod errors during init.
