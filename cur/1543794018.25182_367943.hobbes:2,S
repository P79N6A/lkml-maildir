Well, the syncs should trigger a spinup every time. Laptop mode does not 
influence syncs, really.

"more than half"? Exactly how many partitions *are* there on this 
notebook? ;)

Perhaps you could enable /proc/sys/vm/block_dump. This makes the kernel 
output all disk activity, including block numbers. By looking up the 
corrupted block numbers in your logs you can check later if the 
corrupting write was done by the kernel (i.e., software fault) or not 
(hardware fault).
Note that the output of block_dump may not go into your logs by default, 
because it's output with KERN_DEBUG. You may need to change your log 
settings.
You can add extra context on ext3's state by enabling JBD debugging 
(CONFIG_JBD_DEBUG, IIRC).

It made me rethink my backup strategy as well. :)
