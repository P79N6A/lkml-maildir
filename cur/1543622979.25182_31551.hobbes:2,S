Granted it isn't a huge monster (yet; size below) so use your own judgement;
I won't be upset either way.  I should note that a well respected developer
recently stated (on l-k) the following about making things unconditional:
	There are those of us trying to stuff Linux into embedded devices 
	who if anything want more configuration options not people taking 
	stuff out.
:-)
Same person went on to suggest:
	What I'd much rather see if this is an issue is:
	bool    'Do you want to customise for a very small system'
	which auto enables all the random small stuff if you say no, and goes
	much deeper into options if you say yes.
...an idea I like, but probably not appropriate for 2.4 - so perhaps I'll
work on a CONFIG_TINY for 2.5 if it is generally accepted as an ok plan.
Paul.
