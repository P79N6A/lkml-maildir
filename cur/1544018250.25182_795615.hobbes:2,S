Subject: [PATCH 01/10] sdhci: Add quirk for controllers with no end-of-busy IRQ
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2009/1/21/373

From: Ben Dooks <ben-linux@fluff.org>
The Samsung SDHCI (and FSL eSDHC) controller block seems to fail
to generate an INT_DATA_END after the transfer has completed and
the bus busy state finished.
Changes in e809517f6fa5803a5a1cd56026f0e2190fc13d5c to use the
new busy method are the cause of the behaviour change.
