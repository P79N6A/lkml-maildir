We do both agree that defaulting to polling mode is not a long term 
solution.
The question is what to do until it's resolved - assuming that issues 
like 5989 might not be fixed in time for 2.6.16.
Breaking setups working with the defaults under 2.6.15 in 2.6.16 doesn't 
sound that good.

As far as I understand 6075, the submitter already tried ec_intr=0 
without success.
