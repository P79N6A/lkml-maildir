Yes, these controllers have a 1:1 mapping between UDMA mode and
AMD_UDMA_TIMING value.  Trying to map UDMA mode to cycle time and then map
back to UDMA mode is error prone, and cause for some of the ugly workarounds
in the current driver.  My patch to add Ultra133 support just expands this
ugliness, but works.
The mapping is as follows:
UDMA2 0
UDMA1 1
UDMA0 2
UDMA3 4
UDMA4 5
UDMA5 6
UDMA6 7
Other ACPI aware OS'es use an ACPI method to change IDE timing, so this is
hidden from the OS.
