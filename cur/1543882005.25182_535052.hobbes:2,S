Had run this utility against my battery patches, and caught
bunch of false positives (I believe).
+#define BATTERY_PROP(bat, prop) ({                                 \
+	void *value = bat->get_property(bat, BATTERY_PROP_##prop); \
+	value ? *(int*)value : 0;                                  \
+})
Got: "Macros with multiple statements should be enclosed in a do - while
loop"
I believed ({}) is equivalent for "do - while", it's widely used in
kernel.
+	switch (bp) {
+	default: break;
+	};
Got "Gotos should not be indented", at "default: break;"
+static int bind_pst_to_psy(struct power_supplicant *pst,
+                           struct power_supply *psy)
+{
Got "use tabs not spaces". Here spaces intentionally used for
formatting purpose, not for the indenting.
