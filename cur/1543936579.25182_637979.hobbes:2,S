Not neccessarily see below. For strings there is a tricky tradeoff
between space on embedded boxes and simplicity. On a 2GB desktop PC the
decision is fairly trivial, on a PDA it gets a bit more important.

If your platform creates the device statically (as a lot of embedded
platforms do) then the __init is fine. The platform register in
init_module will call back the driver probe method and attach the device
before the init_module exits.
