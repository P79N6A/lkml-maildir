Hi,
I wondered whether thera are already effrots to por the Multipath-driver
for FibreChannel (
http://t3.linuxcare.org
) to the 2.4 kernel? This patch
allows a transparent failover to another path to FC-attached
disk in case the primary path fails.
Is there any documentation about the changes in the SCSI-driver interfaces
from 2.2 -> 2.4 (eg. in sd.c) ?
