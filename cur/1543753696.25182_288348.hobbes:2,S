Hi,
I think that the driver should be integrated into 2.6 input system
before merging it into the kernel so touchscreen data can be accessed
through standard interfaces (evdev, mousedev, tsdev) without the need
for a special device.
Also MODULE_PARM is obsolete and shoudl be repleced with module_param().
