No, but convoluted and unreadable code ends up being crappier due
to lack of review.  And that's aside of the memory footprint,
likeliness of bugs introduced by code modifications (having in-core
and on-disk data structures with different contents and the same C
type => trouble that won't be caught by compiler), etc.
