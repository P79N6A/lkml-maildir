Yes, indeed discussing is what FSF has allocated an entire year for.
While it is possible that this particular criticism was based on a
misunderstanding, which may be an indicator of need for language
improvement, all criticism should ideally be put into a comprehensive
form and submitted through the gplv3.fsf.org/comments system.
If Linus lacks the time to do it himself, maybe some people on this
list could help gather his points as possible submissions for
improvement?

Georg
