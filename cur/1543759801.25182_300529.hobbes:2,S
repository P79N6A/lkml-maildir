Oh gosh.  It was a transformation from the global journal_datalist_lock and
jh_splice_lock locks.  jbd_lock_bh_journal_head() is supposed to be a
finegrained innermost lock whose mandate is purely for atomicity of adding
and removing the journal_head and the b_jcount refcounting.  I don't recall
there being any deeper meaning than that.
The original changelog says:
  buffer_heads and journal_heads are joined at the hip.  We need a lock to
  protect the joint and its refcounts.
  JBD is currently using a global spinlock for that.  Change it to use one bit
  in bh->b_state.
It could be that we can optimise jbd_lock_bh_journal_head() away, as you
mention.  If we have an assertion in there to check that
jbd_lock_bh_state() is held...
