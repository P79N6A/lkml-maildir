The block is the disk block, which does not get segmented.
What you have is a small layer that tells you which block a pagecache
page points to, and which pagecache page refers to a given block. Just
like we have now only slightly extended.

Ahh, then you reboot your machine to access your other filesystems?

That gives you have the proper infrastructure that is needed to actually
support higher order _physical_ allocations _properly_.
