To come back to Randy's original question ...
Cpusets are not - in my view - designed to display the NUMA architecture.
/sys already does this very well (example of a 16 way machine) :
$ ls /sys/devices/system/node/node*
/sys/devices/system/node/node0:
cpu0  cpu1  cpu2  cpu3  cpumap  distance  meminfo  numastat
/sys/devices/system/node/node1:
cpu4  cpu5  cpu6  cpu7  cpumap  distance  meminfo  numastat
/sys/devices/system/node/node2:
cpu10  cpu11  cpu8  cpu9  cpumap  distance  meminfo  numastat
/sys/devices/system/node/node3:
cpu12  cpu13  cpu14  cpu15  cpumap  distance  meminfo  numastat
I think sysfs remains the best way to view your NUMA nodes.
