IOW, merge of new devfs code (2.4.17-pre1 in -STABLE, 2.5.1-pre2 in -CURRENT).
We really need CONFIG_DEBUG_* forced if CONFIG_DEVFS_FS is set.  Otherwise
we'll be getting tons of bug reports due to silent memory corruption.
Keith, is there a decent way to do that?  For 2.4.17 it would help a lot...
