So NMI changing the preempt count and restoring in the middle of a RWM 
is not the problem.  Thus I don't understand what the issue is.  NMI 
must undo all side effects.  Does the PREEMPT_DEBUG code check the count 
somewhere within the NMI handler?  If so, shouldn't the proper fix be to 
make that code aware that it could be running inside of an NMI and/or 
ensure that code is not called from within the NMI handler?
