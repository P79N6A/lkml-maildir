Subject: [patch 2.6.22-rc2-git] omap_uwire: SPI_CPHA mode bugfix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

From: Imre Deak <imre.deak@solidboot.com>
The omap_uwire controller driver handles SPI_CPHA incorrectly;
It should mean:
  CPHA=0 ... sample at leading edge of clock
  CPHA=1 ... sample at trailing edge of clock
This bug has been masked by inverse bugs in layered drivers;
and was uncovered by running some of them on non-OMAP hardware.
