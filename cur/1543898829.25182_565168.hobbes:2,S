Ok, here's a patch to just remove the check.
In drivers/pnp/isapnp/core.c::isapnp_read_tag() there is a test of 
'type' being == 0 a bit down in the function. That test doesn't make 
any sense. If 'type' could indeed be NULL, then the test happens way 
too late as we'd already have tried to dereference the pointer 
earlier and looking at the callers it also turns out that there is 
no way type can ever actually be NULL.
So the test is completely pointless and should just be removed.
