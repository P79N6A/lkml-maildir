In this manner, it is also possible to construct names with \n.  So how are you
to correctly find bash\n with the current parsing?

This is a slippery slope argument.  If there were a large enough user base of
people accidentally saving files in ms word format, and it was a one line fix,
and it didn't break anything else, then I would agree with you that the kernel
should support this.
But you probably have better things to do than argue with the likes of me.
Thanks for the joust.
Chris
