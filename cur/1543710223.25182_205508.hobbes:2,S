So you're doing something like:
# modprobe ipw2100
# iwconfig eth1 ap 00:0d:88:28:2e:91
# ifconfig eth1 up
and if you skip the iwconfig step you see the fatal interrupt?
Btw, thanks for your prior post with the oops info.  There is a fix in the 
latest snapshot (0.30) on 
http://ipw2100.sf.net
.
Thanks,
James
