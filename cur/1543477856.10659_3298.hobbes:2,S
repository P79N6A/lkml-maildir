Interesting. "bh->b_next" is crap (it has the value 0xffff, which is not a
kernel pointer). 
I've seen this kind of oops report before, but I actually suspect it was
also from you, Kurt, and as far as I know you're the only one. Getting
corrupted buffer lists is rather serious, is there anything special you're
doing, or is there anything nonstandard in your setup? 
One reason I cleaned up fs/buffer.c a lot recently was your previous
report - I felt that the complexity of buffer.c was keeping me from being
able to give the report the proper attention.
However, looking at the uses of bh->b_next and bh->b_pprev, this oops
_still_ looks very unlikely indeed, and now I can't even complain about
extra complexity in fs/buffer.c... 
Are you having other oopses or user-level problems (SIGSEGV's etc)? Do you
use any experimental features in your kernel? This looks like memory
corruption to me, possibly due to some wild kernel pointer from somewhere
else.
