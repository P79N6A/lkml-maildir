Yes, this is what actually happens. JFYI see current thread on lkml which

You can of course work this around by adding an udev rule such as
SUBSYSTEM=="input",KERNEL=="event*",SYSFS{name}=="appletouch",SYMLINK+="input/appletouchpad"
and the let Xorg use /dev/input/appletouchpad, which will always be a 
symlink to the correct device.
