I've compiled a list of security related issues with path based access
control at
http://securityblog.org/brindle/2006/04/19/security-anti-pattern-path-based-access-control/
I intentionally avoided specific implementations and OS related issues
to focus on the security aspects. Note that not all path based access
control implementations are subject to all these problems but some are
common to all.
