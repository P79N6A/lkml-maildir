The VM changes in 2.4.5 fixed a very serious performance problem.  IMHO,
2.4.5 is a step in the right direction.  (and I hope more steps are in
the offing;)

Interactive performance became a problem here exactly at the point when
we stopped waiting for the vm to produce results.  (which rather sucks,
because that's also the spot where throughput improved [non-suprise])
