  In my general "ignore this please" interpretation as
  "help! I need help!" --  New VGER seems to work mostly,
  but I forgot to change one directory permission, and
  everybody who have emailed Majordomo for something have
  gotten some strange error message + the majordomo action..
  All it means is that our Majordomo incoming request log
  is now incomplete for few hours worth of requests.
  Not a big deal.
  Now I am heading off the network for next 36 or so hours.
  Good luck, safe riding.
