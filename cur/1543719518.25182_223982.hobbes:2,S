Sorry, floating point in the Linux kernel isn't allowed.

Probably, but it doesn't matter, since the kernel doesn't link with
libc.

Using floating point emulation will be VERY slow.

As I said, the kernel doesn't link with libc.

Floating point is forbidden in kernel code since the floating point
registers (and other floating point context) is not saved/restored
during system calls, for efficiency.  I'm speculating here, but it
might be possible to manually save the floating point context while
doing some floating point operations.  The problem arises if this code
is interrupted midway.  Using a preemptive 2.6 kernel would easily
break here.
What you should do is think again about why you need all this floating
point in the kernel.  Could it be moved to userspace somehow?  Maybe
you could use lookup tables instead of doing floating point
arithmetic.
