It is a fast SCSI, the 9100A (not the 9100U). But I am also having trouble
with an adaptec 2940 fast scsi on the same machine. I verified the card
worked on another box, something weird with the PCI on this motherboard or
bad BIOS version or something. ISA cards work fine.
The adaptec card gives me some more info, it looks like it looks for
target 0, times out, then finds it, goes to target 1, times out, then
finds it, then tries target2 which does not exist and hangs forever. I
wonder if it is some kind of edge/level thing.

COuld you send me that again, it is buried in a mailbox blizzard.
Thanks for the assist.
