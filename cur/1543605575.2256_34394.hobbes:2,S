Hi Alan,
The acpi stuff doesn't compile.
acpitable.c: In function `__va_range':
acpitable.c:479: `FIX_IO_APIC_BASE_0' undeclared (first use in this function)
acpitable.c:479: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
acpitable.c:479: for each function it appears in.)
acpitable.c:496: `FIX_IO_APIC_BASE_END' undeclared (first use in this function)
Regards,
Udo.
