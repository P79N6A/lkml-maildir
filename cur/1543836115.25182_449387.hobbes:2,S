Subject: [PATCH] Fix initialization of runqueues
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Hi,
There's an odd thing about the nr_active field in arrays of runqueue_t:
it is actually never initialized to 0!...  This doesn't yet trigger a
bug probably because the way runqueues are allocated make it so that
it is already initialized to 0, but that's not a safe way.  Here is a
patch:
Initialize to zero the nr_active field of arrays of runqueues.
(fixes future potential dynamic allocation of runqueues).
