Then you continue to crap up the code with
	if (48bit)
		...
	else
		...
etc.
The proper way to do this is "cp -a ext3 ext4" (excluding JBD as Andrew 
mentioned), and then let evolution take its course.
"Evolution" means the standard Linux developement -- patch the kernel, 
patch e4fsprogs, test, lather rinse repeat.  The best development 
platform for new features is one that _works_, and keeps working.
