REVOKE(2)                 OpenBSD Programmer's Manual                REVOKE(2)
NAME
     revoke - revoke file access
SYNOPSIS
     #include <unistd.h>
     int
     revoke(const char *path);
DESCRIPTION
     The revoke function invalidates all current open file descriptors in the
     system for the file named by path. Subsequent operations on any such de-
     scriptors fail, with the exceptions that a read() from a character device
     file which has been revoked returns a count of zero (end of file), and a
     close() call will succeed.  If the file is a special file for a device
     which is open, the device close function is called as if all open refer-
     ences to the file had been close
[SNAP]
Means, that it returns different values for normal files and device
files? Do I understand that correctly?
- -EIO for files
0 for device nodes

So I guess if we simply munmap them, programs will fail (will
segfault?). Or is it safe to munmap a mapping, while some
program is using it?

Is it really required to close it in revoke? I mean, if we flush it,
no data remains unwritten to disk. The user program will call
close, later by itself.

Yes, yes. I know. ;)
