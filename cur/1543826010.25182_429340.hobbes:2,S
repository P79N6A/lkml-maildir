I'm sorry, but nice never looked "nice" to me.
Have you ever tried to "nice" apache server which spawns 500 
processes/threads on a loaded machine?
With nice you _can't_ impose limits or priority on the whole "apache".
The more apaches you have the more useless their priorites and nices are...

the same for this. you can't limit a _user_, only his processes.
Today I have 1 task and 20% limit is ok, tomorrow I have 10 tasks and 
this 20% limits changes nothing in the system.
