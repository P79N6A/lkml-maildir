Hello!
While trying to setup qos with test4 I get some problems:
When running qos-neu (
http://schotteli.us/~nico/qos-neu
) dmesg says:
HTB init, kernel part version 3.13
HTB: quantum of class 10010 is small. Consider r2q change.
HTB: quantum of class 10011 is small. Consider r2q change.
HTB: quantum of class 10012 is small. Consider r2q change.
And then testing with the ftp (passive) transmissions shows 16kbyte/s, although
I moved mark 13 to 2kbit.
Then trying to match the ftp connections
bruehe:~#  iptables -A OUTPUT -m owner --uid-owner 0 -j ACCEPT   
iptables: Invalid argument
bruehe:~# iptables -t mangle -A POSTROUTING -o ppp0 -m owner --uid-owner 1001 -j MARK --set-mark 55
iptables: Invalid argument
Why does iptables or the kernel not accept that?
Greetings,
Nico
