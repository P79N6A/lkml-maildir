Excellent!  By the way, please remove printk from my patch.  It turns out
that the socket is initialized more often than I expected (every time a
card is inserted), so it creates too much noise on the console.
I have tested a Ricoh bridge (Ricoh Co Ltd RL5c476 II), and it works
already, so let's not fix what is not broken, although I know what to do
if the IRQ problems are reported by someone else.
