	Hello, all.
	I am using an ABIT BP6 board (SMP, 2 Celerons at 366MHz, none
overclocked, *very* stable) which uses the HPT366 controller. I am getting
through these messages when using the *original* ATA cable (never touched
before) or a replacement one:
hde: dma_intr: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hde: dma_intr: error=0x84 { DriveStatusError BadCRC }
	(when the drive first fscks from a dirty reboot)
	And, in kernel messages, whilst doing hdparm -tT /dev/hde3:
->	invalidate: busy buffer
	(from fs/buffer.c)
	(yes, it is wrong to use hde3, but when I use hde, but whatever;
using hda3 or hda did not matter when I used this *same* HDD with normal
IDE cable (not using HPT366))
	I am not using *any* special features (untuned HDD), drive was set
to DMA mode 4 at the HPT BIOS.
	Any clues on this? I am using kernel 2.4.17, libc 2.2.4, hdparm
4.1.
	PS: For now, I'll use this HDD with the normal cables, as I fear
corruption. (yes, the drive runs *perfectly* with the normal cables and
not connected to the HPT366 IDE. It is a Seagate ST310211A HDD.)
	Thanks,
	Cesar Suga <sartre@linuxbr.com>
