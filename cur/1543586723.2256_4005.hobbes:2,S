Hi Joachim,
Personally, I agree with you, but I can also understand David's
desire to avoid wasting time chasing phantom bugs that only
show up due to this broken hardware.  If it turns out that
there is actually a well-defined workaround that AMD will
tell us about, it shouldn't take too long before we have a
real fix and the AMD-756 can be taken off of the blacklist.
My guess is that there are specific drivers for which this
hardware bug causes problems.  You probably just aren't
using the *right* drivers.  :-)
Luckily, USB add-on cards are pretty cheap, so I suppose you
could just put a new host-controller in your test machine
for a month or two until David and Alan get this sorted out
with AMD.  Think of it this way, you'll have more hardware
configurations to test with, so get a UHCI or EHCI card.
Woohoo!  (Only half kidding)
