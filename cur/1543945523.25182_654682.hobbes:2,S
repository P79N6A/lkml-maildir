Why should that fail? You're accessing a kernel space address here and no
user space address.
Indeed it does fail with an Oops on s390 since we enable low address
protection in the kernel so we get an exception if something within the
kernel writes to the first 512 bytes of the kernel address space.
Otherwise it would have silently passed the test...
