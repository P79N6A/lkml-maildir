Hi,
I tried to use kdb on my 2.2.14-12 kernel. I was able to compile the file 
/usr/src/linux/arch/i386/kdb/modules/kdbm_vm.c and could get the object
file. When I tried to insert it as a module it givesd the following error
message:
./kdbm_vm.o: kernel-module version mismatch
        ./kdbm_vm.o was compiled for kernel version .2.14-12
        while this kernel is version 2.2.14-12.
Please tell me why this message comes.
Thanks in advance,
Regards,
satish.j
