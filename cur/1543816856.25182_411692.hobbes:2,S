well, another possibility is that the task got blocked again, and we'll 
continue boosting _the wrong chain_. I.e. we'll add extra priority to 
task(s) that might not deserve it at all (it doesnt own the lock we are 
interested in anymore).
i.e. we must observe the boosting chain in a time-coherent form. We must 
observe an actual "frozen" (all locks held) state of the system that we 
_know_ forms a correct dependency chain at that moment, to be able to 
propagate the priority one step forward. The act of 'boosting' must be 
atomic.
