Hmm, you mean quota has been broken _again_?

OK, fixed in the patch below, and I've queued it on bugzilla.  Only
edquota was broken: quotacheck, repquota and quota all seem happy with
the larger quota limits.
Is anyone maintaining the core quota code at the moment?  The last time
I sent in these fixes was a good while ago.
