this also caused no end of badness trying to migrate from LVM2 (Linux 2.4) 
to DM+LVM2 (Linux 2.6) where the major/minor numbers changed.
while the real fix is to educate lvmcreate_initrd to be more intelligent (i 
had to create a new one which includes 
mknod/devmap_mknod.sh/mkdir/sed/rm/cat/lvdisplay binaries), it is certainly 
a big trap for the unwary that happen to use LVM1/LVM2 as a root volume.
cheers,
lincoln.
