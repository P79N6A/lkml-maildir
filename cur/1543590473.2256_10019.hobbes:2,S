It appears that a -EIO return from block_write_full_page() will
result in an unlock of an unlocked page in page_launder(). Splat.
What does the new writepage() argument do, and why does
it exist?
What action should the individual writepage()s take in
response to different values of `priority'?
What is the meaning of the writepage return value for
the respective values of `priority'?
When should writepage return with the page locked,
and when not?
