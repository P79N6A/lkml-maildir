technically you are right. But the question is - while K is considered a 
constant, and N (nr_running_RT_tasks) is technically not bounded - in 
practice N is bounded just as much. Have you ever seen any hard-RT 
application that has more than 140 threads _running at the same time_ on 
a single CPU? You can even enforce it to be theoretically bounded, via 
ulimits.
in fact, K and N should be pretty close to each other for most 
applications. I'd be interested in real application scenarios where N is 
much (== more than 10 times) larger than K and plists really matter.
