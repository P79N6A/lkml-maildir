I don't think it's harder to debug, you need the per-superblock data
structures for ->clear_inode() also if you try to ->clear_inode in iput,
and I cannot see any valid reason for which the fs would be allowed to
screwup the superblock before returning from read_inode. As soon as you
call iget the superblock must be sane and there's no point in screwing
it up afterwards.
