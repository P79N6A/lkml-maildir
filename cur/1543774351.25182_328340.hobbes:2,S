No, I don't work on that anymore, so you probably want to port deflate 
as well. My investigation showed that it can't be easily done without 
hacking zlib internals, unless you greatly lose the compression ratio by 
flushing the zstream and do other ugly things.
Nevertheless, you're the compression specialist(s), so you should do 
this better :-)
