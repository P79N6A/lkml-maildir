hi,
> iperf, between a 2.6.0 box and a WinXP box (both running Netgear GA302Ts with the AC9100), shows max throughput of 35MB/sec.
i have also two boxes (one with 2.6.0, the other one 2.6.1-mm2) equipped with netgear ga302t cards (x-over cable).
i don't see a very high cpu usage, but since upgrading to 2.6.x kernels i sometimes have really weird speed issues. i often only get transfer rates of about ~200-300 kilobytes/second...yes, and this over a gigabit interface, tested over ftp.
i'm also running a nfs server on the 2.6.1-mm2 box, the 2.6.0 pc is the client, but again, sometimes it's *very* slow. if i reboot my 2.6.1-mm2 box (the other one is a server which can't be rebooted) it seems to be fine for some time.
i didn't have such problems with 2.4.19 kernels on both pcs, there i got about 30-35MB/s over ftp without any problems, so i don't think it's hardware related.
lspci -v
2.6.1-mm2:
00:09.0 Ethernet controller: Altima (nee Broadcom) AC9100 Gigabit Ethernet (rev 15)

same as above, only other interrupt
this is also something i don't know how to debug, it is on the 2.6.0 box with an uptime of 7 days.
ifconfig:

how can i find out where these errors come from?
thx,
