gzip magic at 0x4110 for a compressed 1.7 MB, i386, 
2.4.18-xfs linux kernel
x86 boot sector with GRUB at 0xE3ACB6
gzip magic at 0xFA0E4 for file named "image" that contains 
a compressed 24 MB ext2 filesystem
gzip magic at 0x80D278 for a compressed 1.7 MB, i386,
2.4.18-xfs linux kernel (apparently a backup)
gzip magic at 0x90324Ci for a file name "fl_image" that
also contains a compressed 24 MB ext2 filesystem
A quick look through their filesystem shows plenty of GPL'd
stuff.  Mostly looks lika RedHat ripoff, with a bunch of
apparently proprietary junk under /itasca,
