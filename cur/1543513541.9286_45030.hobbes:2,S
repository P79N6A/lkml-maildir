NOTENOTE: when you return from schedule_timeout you _always_ are in
TASK_RUNNING state.
So your example was perfectly right but I forgot to tell you that the
'current->state = TASK_RUNNING' was not necessary. It won't hurt of course
but it's not necessary.
So the right way to unconditionally wait for 5 sec _if_ you are not
registered in any waitqueue and so if you can't be wakenup from a kernel
event (that is not a signal) is:
	__set_current_state(TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE);
	schedule_timeout(5*HZ);
So if an init_module() looks like this:
	init_module()
	{
		__set_current_state(TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE);
		schedule_timeout(5*HZ);
		...
		<code>
	}
then you are sure that the init_module will sure wait 5 sec before
executing <code> because the process running in the early code in
init_module is can't be registered in any waitqueue (this because the
module syscall is not registering itself before calling the init_module
callback).
If you are registered for getting wakeups from some kernel event and and
you want to block unconditionally for 5 sec then you have instead to do
this:
	unsigned long timeout = 5*HZ;
	do {
		__set_current_state(TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE);
		timeout = schedule_timeout(timeout);
	} while (timeout);
		
Also note that in 2.3.x you should use __set_current_state(TASK_*) (the 
assembler it's the same but the code looks cleaner ;).

Exactly because when you return from schedule_timeout() you are always a
running task, you must always set the state to TASK_[UN]INTERRUPTIBLE
before running schedule_timeout again for a second time.

They are not buggy if they are using TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE and they can't
be wakenup by _hand_ from a wake_up_process() somewhere.
They are not buggy if they are using TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE and they are
expecting to return early in case of a signal and they can't be wakenup by
some lowlevel kernel code.
>- Are signals the only reason for early-exit?  If so, then if I use
No. It depends on the code you are running. If you registered yourself in
a waitqueue, then you can get a wakeup from an kernel event as well
(usually this is used to get wakeups from irqs).

No. TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE only forbids signals to wakeup the task.
For example: when you wait for I/O completation you first register
yourself in the page->wait waitqueue, and then you go to sleep in
UNINTERRUPTIBLE state. So only the wakeup at IO completation time will be
able to wakeup you (so only when the I/O is completated you'll get
rescheduled). If you'll press C^c the task won't be interrupted (and
infact you'll have to wait I/O completation before being able to interrupt
the task).

Could you make some example? If they are using TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE probably
they are checking for a signal to giveup and exit early.
Also note that kswapd and friends are using INTERRUPTIBLE for a very
subtle reason. Give a try to use UNINTERRUPTIBLE and you'll find your CPU
load fixed to 3 (kswapd+kupdate+kflushd = 3) ;). For such daemons using
interruptible or not make no difference as it will only generate an
early run that only root can trigger (and interruptible avoids the loadavg
screwup).
