I hope you are not using the old /dev/epoll since it is no more supported.
The kernel 2.5.x has epoll, that is supported :

Yes, you can't have more than 1024 simultaneous connections with httperf.
But if the session time is short, you can achieve a pretty high rate with
1024 maximum connections. Lately I am using the http blaster ( ver very
simple http loader ) that uses epoll. The latest source code is here :
http://www.xmailserver.org/linux-patches/epoll-lib-0.7.tar.gz
You need this coroutine library to build that package :

You definitely have to tweak kernel/net params to run the test ( port
range, fin timeout, tw recycle, max files, ... ).
