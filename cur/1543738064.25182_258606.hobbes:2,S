That certainly seems like a reasonable option for qlogicfc and
qlogicisp.  Attached is a small patch which will limit the scope of
qlogicfc_asm variables.
We could also strip out the !UNIQUE_FW_NAME stuff out of the qla1280.c
driver.  Firmware updates to those ISPs will likely _not_ happen, so we
don't need to worry about adding the static modifier at each churn as we
would with the qla2xxx driver.  I'll forward along a patch in a later
email.

unifdef script I run before sending updates upstream -- something I
recall Christoph wanting earlier.
