You already have a working kernel which you want to rename to use as a
backup version.  Changing EXTRAVERSION and recompiling builds a new
kernel and adds uncertainty about whether the kernel still works - did
you change anything else before recompiling?  Look at all the install
scripts that rename vmlinuz to vmlinuz-old.
