The shared page table patch also gives a nice boost to the fork speed as
tested on a woodcrest machine using lmbench-3.0-a7.
2.6.18-rc4 with shared page table enabled (usec):
fork 136
exec 303
sh   828
2.6.18-rc4 without shared page table (usec):
fork 179
exec 364
sh   949
The test was done with the lmbench option to pin both parent and child
onto the same cpu core, and lmbench includes the overhead of calling
sched_setaffinity.
