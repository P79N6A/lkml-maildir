ouch - getter better soon!

it 'can' be very bad - so we have to assume it's random and fall back to 
jiffies quality in that case. In practice on most x86 CPUs it wont drift 
that far - even drifting TSCs drift minimally (there are AMD 
Athlon64/Opteron CPUs where a CPU in HLT will cause the clock and the 
TSC to drift a bit) - and stopping TSCs will just stop.
But in terms of BIOSes trying to fix things up and in terms of cpufreq 
artifacts (the CPU's clock itself going through transients) anything can 
happen and the code must be robust.

we rarely get any interactivity reports from anything non-x86 so i doubt 
it truly matters on anything but x86. If it _breaks_ in terms of 
crashing or locking we do hear from other architectures ;-)
