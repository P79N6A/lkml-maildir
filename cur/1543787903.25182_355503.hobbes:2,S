analysis, verification, debugging and adoption of oskit by
the linux kernel maintainers would help enormously there,
i believe, which is why i invited the kernel maintainers to
give it some thought.
there are other reasons: not least is that oskit _is_ the
linux kernel source code - with the kernel/* bits removed and
the device drivers and support infrastructure remaining.
so the developers who split the linux source code out into oskit did
not, in your opinion and experience, meelis, do a very good job: so
educate them and tell them how to do it better.
