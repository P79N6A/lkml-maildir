We need more data. First, "Kernel 2.6.x" is not good enough.
Give us a precise version on which you observe this.
Second, running with CONFIG_USB_STORAGE_DEBUG may yield a useful trace.
I am not quite sure about that though, as this seems to be some
misunderstanding between the block level and SCSI.
Problems with block device open() not working right fall squarely
into purview of Al Viro, but he's quite busy right now. Someone
has to identify the exact scenario. I suppose adding a few printks
around fs/block_dev.c may be more beneficial than any USB debugging.
