All I can say is _WOW_.  This is exactly the same thing that
happened to me just now.. ;o)  Well, almost..
I had an ALi Aladdin IV+ motherboard before and was getting
7.6M/s and 9.8M/s out of it with a stock kernel with a few hdparm
tweaks but no DMA.
Both drives are Quantum Fireballs, and SE and an EL.
I just got a DFI K6VB3 +66 motherboard with a VIA MVP3 chipset
which is also ATA66.  I was looking forward to UDMA enabling
these drives, but when I booted up I expected at _least_ the
speed that I was getting on the old board.  Instead I got a
surprise:
2 root@asdf:/etc/X11# hdparm -t /dev/hd[ab]
/dev/hda:
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in 12.47 seconds =  5.13 MB/sec
/dev/hdb:
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in 13.18 seconds =  4.86 MB/sec
Repeated tests give the same results.  ;o(
So my CPU went from being a K6-200 to a K6/2-333 (actually a 350
underclocked to 333 with 66*5 because my memory is 66Mhz).  So I
was hoping for a decent speedup.  The hard disk slowdown from
9.8M/s to 5.13 sucks the big one pretty badly.  It virtually
negates the point of the upgrade.  ;o(
Also, I'm using a 2.2.16 kernel with this new motherboard, and
Linux only detects 64M of RAM.  I had to force 96M with a lilo
append line.  ;o(
So, so far I'm not too impressed with either Linux, or the
motherboard, or both...  Also, as if this didn't suck badly
enough already, all the hardware in my machine is exactly the
same as it was, except now X windows will not start.  No errors,
it just half-starts, and then fails, with no errors.  I
reconfigured it despite the fact it is the same video card,
mouse, everything, and it still fails.  ;o(
Are there any known problems with this motherboard/chipset, etc?
Also, this is in my /var/log/messages right at boot time:

I've got these 2 Quantum drives on one cable, and 2 CDROM's on
the other cable.  Both cables are exactly 18 inches long
(measured).
Is there a way to get back to at least 9.8M/s with the default
kernel?  I mean I was getting that with only:
hdparm -m16c1k1 /dev/hd[ab]
Now with the same setting, I get the crappy 5.x M/s..  ;o(
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  I'd like to get
things going with the stock kernel first, and understand the
above errors first before anything else.  Should I apply Andre's
IDE patches and try again?  I used them before on various other
computers with good success, but not on this machine because it
wasn't properly UDMA compatible before.
Thanks in advance.
