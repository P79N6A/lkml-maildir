Motorola makes similar sensors (MMA1220D, etc). The fact that the sensor
is from AD doesn't mean anything, unfortunately, it's a generic sensor
used in videocameras (picture stabilization), digital cameras (picture
orientation detection), joysticks (logitech wingman gamepad), and many
other devices.
It's IBM (Lenovo) who interfaced it to some kind of a A/D and a
processor inside the machine that detects the free fall condition and
informs the BIOS/OS about it.

I believe at this moment the best approach is to track where the
connections on the mainboard go from the accelerometer. ;)
