Subject: [2.6 patch] let X86_VOYAGER depend on SMP
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I noted that X86_VOYAGER=y and SMP=n doesn't compile.
It might be possible to fix this, but as far as I understand it, all 
Voyager machines are SMP, implying that such a configuration doesn't 
make much sense.
