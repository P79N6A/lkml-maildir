Yeah, I noticed that too.

The problem there is that this bloats struct file, and that seemed like
something worth avoiding.  It could easily be done, but I don't know
why we would before knowing that the global spinlock is a problem. 
But... it's *already* protected by a global spinlock (the BKL) which is
(still) more widely used.

I didn't think of that one.  Using a lock which is three indirections
away seems a little obscure; again, I guess we could do that if the
global spinlock actually turns out to be a problem.

I did think of that one.  Reasons not to include growing struct file
and the fact that there are places which set more than one flag at
once.  So we'd replace assignments with loops - and we still don't
solve the fasync() problem.
So that was my thinking.
I'll address your other comments when I get back home.
Thanks,
