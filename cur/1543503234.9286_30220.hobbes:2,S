What about another task flag to cope with this?  Hunt down the places
which do set_fs(KERNEL_DS) and set a flag in the dangerous case.
Then the two-liner can examine that flag instead of get_ds().
Disclaimer: this suggestion based upon having seen the proposed
solution, rather than an understanding of the original problem :)
