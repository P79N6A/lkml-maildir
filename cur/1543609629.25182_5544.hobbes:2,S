Actually, knfsd can see mountpoints: you just have to explicitly tell
it which mountpoints it is allowed to cross by using the 'nohide'
export option. (man 5 exports)
For instance:
/foo     client1
/foo/bar client1(nohide)
Should ensure that client1 can mount /foo, and expect to be able to
see the filesystem on /foo/bar as well...

It is an action that is recommended in the RFCs. If you didn't have
this, then you could end up with nasty things happening, for instance,
in the case where the server accidentally re-exports another NFS
partition.
In addition you quickly end up with basic wierdness such as duplicate
inode numbers and the like on the client, since that sees the whole
thing as 1 partition.
