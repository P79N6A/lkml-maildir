I've seen this with PIIX and Western Digital IDE disks with DMA on on
several 2.4 kernels: Slow(ish) corruption of filesystems, even when
read-mostly. It looks like accesing the filesystem screws it up, not only
writing (i.e., / is at highest risk, even if you almost never write there).
It is quite entertaining to have /etc turn into a plain file...
Dunno if related.
