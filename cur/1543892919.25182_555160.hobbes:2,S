Yes it was.

I do fear that that could become a maintenance nightmare.  For instance
right now there's the call to fsnotify_mkdir().  Other such hooks might
be placed at vfs_mkdir, which we'd then likely want to have placed in
our container_mkdir() and container_clone() fns.  And of course
may_create() is static inline in fs/namei.c.  It's trivial, but still if
it changes we'd want to change the version in kernel/container.c as
well.
What would be the main advantage of doing it this way?  Do you consider
the extra subys->auto_setup() hook to be avoidable bloat?
thanks,
