It looks like the patch somehow got dropped on the floor for the -stable
series.  I have no idea whether it's in -rc4.  You may want to inspect
the code before you waste your time.
Here are the two patches you need:
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/alsa/alsa-kernel/usb/usbaudio.c?r1=1.119&r2=1.120
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/alsa/alsa-kernel/usb/usx2y/usbusx2y.c?r1=1.9&r2=1.10
