This is off-topic for linux kernel but I think it will be of interest
to some poeple here.  Please send replies to me, not to linux-kernel.
I have released qtrace 0.4.  qtrace is a trace-and-replay debugger
which can trace the execution of a linux program, store the results
of the trace in a trace file, and then re-create the execution of
the program on the same or different machine.  qtrace provides an
interface so that gdb or other debuggers can watch the re-execution
as if it were an ordinary running program.
This is a snapshot release only.  It doesn't currently work.  I just
wanted to publish my current work so that interested parties could
see the code.
