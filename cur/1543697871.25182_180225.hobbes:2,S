Oh, right... That would be the server code you are thinking of, then.
The client already does something like this. I've added a function
tcp_read_sock() that is called directly from tcp_data_ready() and
hence fills the page cache directly from within the softirq.
There are a still few inefficiencies with this approach, though. Most
notable is the fact that you need to call kmap_atomic() several times
per page since the socket lower layers will usually be feeding you 1
skb at a time. I thought you might be referring to those (and that you
might have a good solution to propose ;-))
Cheers,
