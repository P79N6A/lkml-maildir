Yes and no,
	This version didn't work (once I back-ported it to compile on 2.4.18,
which I suppose I may have not been designed to do), but I had already
got v1.02 to compile and work properly with no problems (on a previous
post).
On a similar note, but not related to the original, has anyone used this
driver on 20 ports? I'll be looking into using the driver with 4/5 of
the dfe-580's and was wondering about scalability...?
Thanks anyway Jeff,
Matthew Hall
