Search for a thread on LKML having to do with enabling "sync" on removable 
media, especially VFAT media.  If you are copying a large file, and the FAT 
on the device is being updated with every block, you can literally fry your 
device in a matter of minutes, because the FAT is always in the same spot, 
thus it is always overwriting the same spot.
