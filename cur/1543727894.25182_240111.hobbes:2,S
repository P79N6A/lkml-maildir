I installed a 2.6.8-rc3-mm2 on my development machine and everything
works like it should. I tried a RFCOMM connection to my mobile, a HCRP
connection to my printer and I used a Bluetooth mouse. All stuff worked
perfect.
Do "hciconfig -a" show your Bluetooth device? Do "/proc/bus/usb/devices"
has an entry for it? Check "dmesg" for any USB related error messages.
Regards
Marcel
