Not exactly... Keyboard handler's start method tries to bring state of
new keyboard in sync with the state of the rest of keyboards. The
purpose of start() is not to complete hardware initialization but to
adjust logical state of the device according to handler's
requirements...
But I am backpedaling on my statement about moving it into input core.
The driver (HID in this case) should properly reset the device before
registering it with input layer.
