Odd.  I would expect these two numbers to be a lot closer together.
Try changing the IO scheduler on the drives and see if it makes a
difference.
e.g.
  cat /sys/block/XXX/queue/scheduler
  echo cfq > /sys/block/XXX/queue/scheduler
  echo deadline > /sys/block/XXX/queue/scheduler
See what works best.
