Right. No more coax! Unless a shortening of your life is meaningful to you...
The same is true for el-cheapo RJ-45 connectors. My hit rate for UTP shrinking
using 0.95 EUR connectors is about 99%, compared to 75% (_after_ twiddling with
tiny screwdrivers and cabletesters to avoid loosing too many connectors, else
I'd say <5%) for the 0.20 EUR ones.
