Subject: lost timer check in 2.6.7

2.6.7 has 
+               /* ... but give the TSC a fair chance */
+               if (lost_count > 25)
+                       cpufreq_delayed_get();
While looking at porting this code to x86-64 I noticed that this only runs for 
the first lost timer event. In case of dynamic frequency which varies shouldn't this
be more like
		if ((lost_count % 25) == 0) 
			cpufreq_delayed_get();
? Otherwise this heuristic will only work once.
