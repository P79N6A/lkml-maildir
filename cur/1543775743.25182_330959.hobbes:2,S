I was a bit careful: My patch did switch the default, but LSMs that
don't fill in all security_ops would still fall back to dummy, just
to make sure there is no possibly unintended change in behaviour.
Getting rid of dummy entirely would be better, I agree, but someone
needs to review that this won't break anything.
So how should we proceed?
You want to do the dummy removal first, then have stacker merged
and then what remains of my patches? Or should I start ... ?
