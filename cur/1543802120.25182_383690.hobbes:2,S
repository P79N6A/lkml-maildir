Care to try an experiment?  I'd be very interested in knowing if the 
attached patch cures the real-life problem you were investigating.
It attempts to catch tasks which the interactivity logic has misidentified, 
and "pull their plug".  It maintains a running plausibility check 
(slice_avg) against sleep_avg, and if a sustained disparity appears, cuts 
off a cpu burning task's supply of bonus points such that it has to "run on 
battery" until the disparity decreases to within acceptable limits.
Obviously, anything that affects fairness _will_ affect interactivity to 
some degree. This simple bolt-on throttle has delayed initiation and 
accelerated release in the hopes of keeping it's impact acceptable.  After 
some initial testing, It doesn't _seem_ to suck.
