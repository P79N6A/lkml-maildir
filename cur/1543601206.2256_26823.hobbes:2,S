I just tried the patch and for the first time I've been able to
successfully boot and run a 2.4 kernel with Athlon optimizations.
I have 11 machines all of which oops to death trying to boot
2.4.9ac5 with Athlon optimizations.
The machine that has been successful, and the only one I tried, is an
800 MHz Duron system with an Epox 8KTA3+ MB which is now running fine
with linux 2.4.9ac10 + the Athlon Bug stomper #2 bit 7 patch version 1.
I'll try some more of the machines on Monday.
