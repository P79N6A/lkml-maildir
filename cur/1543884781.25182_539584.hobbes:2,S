Subject: [PATCH] CIFS: make sec=none force an anonymous mount
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

We had a customer report that attempting to make CIFS mount with a null
username (i.e. doing an anonymous mount) doesn't work. Looking through the
code, it looks like CIFS expects a NULL username from userspace in order
to trigger an anonymous mount. The mount.cifs code doesn't seem to ever
pass a null username to the kernel, however.
It looks also like the kernel can take a sec=none option, but it only seems
to look at it if the username is already NULL. This seems redundant and
effectively makes sec=none useless.
The following patch makes sec=none force an anonymous mount. I've briefly
tested it and it seems to work. I suppose we could alternately do some
stuff in userspace to make mount.cifs force a null username instead, but this
seems more straightforward to me.
