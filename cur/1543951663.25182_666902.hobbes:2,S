This:
kernel/power/pm.c:203: warning: 'pm_register' is deprecated (declared at kernel/power/pm.c:62)
kernel/power/pm.c:203: warning: 'pm_register' is deprecated (declared at kernel/power/pm.c:62)
kernel/power/pm.c:204: warning: 'pm_send_all' is deprecated (declared at kernel/power/pm.c:178)
kernel/power/pm.c:204: warning: 'pm_send_all' is deprecated (declared at kernel/power/pm.c:178)
is getting a bit boring.  These were marked deprecated at least three years
ago.
pm_register() no longer has any callers and afacit can be removed
immediately.
pm_send_all() has just a handful of callers:
arch/x86/kernel/apm_32.c
arch/mips/au1000/common/power.c
arch/frv/kernel/pm.c
could we please get a bit of a push on this?  How should these
pm_send_all() calls be replaced?
Thanks.
(I almost have a warning-free x86_64 allmodconfig, but the one in
drivers/message/i2o/i2o_config.c is going to be a problem).
