Does mmap(PROT_NONE) actually free the memory?

Two questions.
In the case of pages being unused then almost immediately reused, why is
it a bad solution to avoid freeing? Is it that you want to avoid
heuristics because in some cases they could fail and end up using memory?
Secondly, why is MADV_DONTNEED bad? How much more expensive is a pagefault
than a syscall? (including the cost of the TLB fill for the memory access
after the syscall, of course).
zapping the pages puts them on a nice LIFO cache hot list of pages that
can be quickly used when the next fault comes in, or used for any other
allocation in the kernel. Putting them on some sort of reclaim list seems
a bit pointless.
Oh, also: something like this patch would help out MADV_DONTNEED, as it
means it can run concurrently with page faults. I think the locking will
work (but needs forward porting).
