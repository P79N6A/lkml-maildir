They're not denying others the freedom that they themselves received. 
Tivo took GPL'd software, modified it, and distributed it with their own 
custom hardware.  You have the right to take their changes, possibly 
modify them further, and distribute them (possibly with your own hardware).
The fact that you can't modify the software and load it back onto the 
tivo is irrelevent.  They are not restricting your distribution of the 
software in any way.  Rather, they're restricting the *running* of the 
software on their proprietary hardware platform.
