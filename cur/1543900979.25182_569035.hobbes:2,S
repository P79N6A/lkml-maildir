Note: my explanations below are based on how I understand these
things, but I'm not the trivial patch monkey nor did I help create
these guidelines, so I'm in no way authoritative on the subject.

If you are unclear of the meaning of the word "trivial", then take a
look here for an explanation:

Hmm, trying to think of examples and all I can think of is stuff like
"its" & "it's" - quite different meaning, very similar spelling.
Someone else can probably think of a better example...

A simple and obviously correct fix for a memory leak.
A simple and obviously correct fix for a NULL pointer dereference.
A simple and obviously correct fix for a off by one error in a loop.
A simple and obviously correct fix for a buffer overrun.
Stuff like that.

That's how I have always read it.

No. Something like fixing a misspelled word, correcting
capitalization, adding a description of something that's currently
missing a description (assuming the description if correct), removing
trailing whitespace, and similar things would be trivial.
When you start changing the meaning of documentation then it needs to
be verified that what you write is actually correct, that is then no
longer a trivial change.

It means that it's OK to replace non-portable code by portable code
even in architecture specific parts of the kernel, since people tend
to copy code from one architecture to another, so having even
arch-specific code portable is good since that means it will probably
still work when someone copies it to a different architecture. The
changes you make to the code to make it portable still have to be
trivial in nature though.

Right. Maintainers are trusted to know what they are doing with the
code they maintain (and authors as well), so when the author or
maintainer of a piece of code submits a patch to the trivial patch
monkey, then it's accepted as OK.

I hope the above make things a little clearer. :-)
