Hi Ingo, Steven, Peter,
  This series applies roughly to mainline as an enhancement to the sched_rt
  logic.  Peter and I were discussing some of the unecessary overhead in
  pull_rt_tasks() via IRC, and this is my RFC attempt to address the problem.
  I have built/booted this on a 4-way C2D Xeon box and it passes preempt-test.
  Comments, please.
  -Greg

      sched: use highest_prio.next to optimize pull operations
      sched: use highest_prio.curr for pull threshold
      sched: track the next-highest priority on each runqueue
