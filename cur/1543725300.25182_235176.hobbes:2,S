Thank you for your prompt reply.
RedHat or Linux from Scratch.  Used to install qt in /opt/qt-version
but now put qt, KDE, kitchen sink in /usr.  So all the headers do
go in /usr/include :-)

My RedHat system has QTDIR=/usr/lib/qt-3.1 in the environment,
(this was set up by the distro, and is not a hack by me).
Sorry I do not know about Debian.
My Linux from Scratch system never has QTDIR set because everything
is in /usr.
