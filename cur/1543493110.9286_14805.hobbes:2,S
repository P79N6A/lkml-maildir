I've recently updated the documentation for the sysctl
files:

If you want to do an honest benchmark, you should (IMHO)
compile a mostly vanilla kernel...

Set a low number of max dirty percentage and
high syncing times...

Forget these two files, they really don't do much
anymore (or need to, with the new algorithms).

Leave at standard value.

If you plan on going into swap, set page-cluster to 5;
if you do a lot of fork()s / exit()s, set pagetable_cache
to something higher...

If you're running with 50+ apache processes, processor
affininity isn't going to buy you much. Better make
sure that each Apache child can serve a lot of processes.
And don't do reverse IP lookups with the standard named :)

10k active connections?  Have you found a way to run
this many processes simultaneously?
(is it included in the kernel and did I miss that event
or isn't it integrated yet?)
