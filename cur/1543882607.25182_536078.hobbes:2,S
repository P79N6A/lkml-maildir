There should be some. Oracle does its own IO scheduling, so it's able
to submit relatively large IO's (IIRC also configurable). I'm not sure
what's done for the non-aio case, but aio might be tricky to catch the
vectoring with all the blocking on get_request_wait() and the way the
vector elements are handled there. So turning off aio may also help.
Another useful idea is to look at the results from pagemap patches.

The RMAN backup utility is often used to back up Oracle databases
and there are always complaints when backups disturb anything.
EM (enterprise management stuff), RAC (clustering affairs), various
database applications (typically in-depth for whatever field they're
pertinent to), ASM middleware (abstraction layer for database file
access), and more are out there.
