I'll answer the memmap in separate email.

The whole e820 must be PCI mappable, bootloader starts in real mode
and if any dma happens it will crash. This is to let any guest OS or
bootloader run with pci passthrough. There's no paravirt here, the
guest has fully native drivers (which is the whole point of this
approach I guess).
This will allow things like running random 3d apps on a random 3d card
on random OS with random 3d driver, all on top of linux host that
leaves the first 1G free for this OS to run with direct access to the
graphics card. Clearly linux host isn't safe, but if you trust that
guest OS that talks directly to the 3d card, you can run many more
guests that are fully swapped out or ballooned or rss limited or ksm
shared, etc... plus the host can run apps too. This is to retain the
full KVM/Linux virtualization power and flexibility without leaving 3d
or any other proprietary hardware out of the equation in the
pci-passthrough guest.
