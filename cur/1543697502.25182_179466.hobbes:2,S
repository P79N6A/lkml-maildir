Dear Friend,
Please excuse me for the inconvience caused by this message.
My name is Valentin. I'm a student and I live with my mother in the city of Kaluga, Russia, that is 200km south from Moscow. My mother is invalid. She cannot see and she receives pension from government very rare which is not enough even for medications.
I work very hard every day to be able to take care of my mother, but my salary is very small, because my studies still not finished. Due to the crisis our authorities recently stoped gas in our district. Now we cannot heat our home without gas. I don't know what to do, because the winter is coming and the temperature in the street can be lower than minus 20 degrees Celsius. I'm very afraid that the temperature inside our home can be very cold and we will not be able to survive.
Our only chance to survive is to use the free access to internet at our local library when it is possible. I have found several e-mail addresses, including yours, that is why I have decided to appeal to you with a prayer in my heart for a small help. 
If you have any old warm clothes, warm blankets, electric heater or portable stove, high-calories food, vitamins, medicaments against cold, any hygiene-products, I will be very grateful to you if you could send it to our postal address which is:
Valentin Mihailin,
Ryleeva Street, 6-45.
Kaluga. 248030,
Russia.
If you think that it would be better or easier for you to help with some money, please write me back and I will give you details for sending it safely if you agree. This way to help is very good because the necessities here are not very expensive.
I hope to hear from you very soon and I pray that you will be able to help us to survive this winter. I also hope very much that this hard situation will get better very soon in our country.
I wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year 2004. I'm sending to you many thanks in advance for your kind understanding. Please excuse me, once more, for any inconvience I could cause you by sending this message.
God Bless You
Valentin and my mother Elena.
Kaluga. Russia.
