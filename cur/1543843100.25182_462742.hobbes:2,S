I am not (generally) concerned with the embedded NICs, it's the slots I 
have had bite me. I do see what you're doing, although I didn't do it 
quite the same way.

And this is why I want to do a slot to name translation, which may 
result in gaps in the names. That doesn't seem to matter. Then I can put 
a label over the slot, like "public" or "private" and know that adding 
another NIC, or replacing a failed NIC will leave my labels intact.

You have mine. I tried putting labels on the NIC, but the machine go to 
live timezones away and repairs are done by whoever has the service 
contract.

Opens the door for change, for sure. Since I have had to use multi-drop 
NICs and nameset like e_slot1_jack2 is an interesting concept. Or 
perhaps just append the jack index no matter how many connections it 
has. So eth2-0 would be a NIC and socket. Then when I run out of slots 
and have to go to a two or four post card, the primary name wouldn't change.
Your idea has just enough usefulness to be dangerous ;-) Thanks.
