What is the reason for all this?  Alignment/wordsize/other?  If you look
at the IOP10 code, much of the in-core data structs were changed to int
or long, so this sparc code may not be necessary.  It may in fact be
damaging, because I don't know if any of the LVM developers even know it
is there, and surely it will be out of sync...
Cheers, Andreas
