Unfortunately we have lots of non neat module names and many previous boot
time arguments note their subsystem which adds even more redundancy.
And you're suggesting people to move to module_parm now in the stable
series leads to renaming of module parameters, which breaks previously
working configurations in often subtle ways. Maybe that's acceptable
in a unstable development kernel, but I don't think it is in 2.6.
How about adding a "setup option alias" table and require that everybody
changing an existing __setup to module_parm adds an alias there?

psmouse_base.psmouse_noext
(brought to you by the department of redundancy department)
The "new" and "improved" version is apparently:
psmouse_base.psmouse_proto=bare
which is even worse.
And 2.6.0 -> 2.6.1 silently changing to that without any documentation anywhere,
silently breaking my mouse. And debugging it requires a lot of reboots
because we have regressed to Windows state where every mouse setting change
requires a reboot :-/
Sorry Rusty. You are probably the wrong target for the flame, but a combination
of probably well intended changes including module_parm brought a total usability 
disaster here.
