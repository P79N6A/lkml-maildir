Symmetric Multi Threading IIRC.
Essentially having a virtual dual CPU system on one die where you can
dispatch multiple programs to the differen execution units. For example
you can run a FP intensive program at the same time as an Integer
intensive program.
Nowhere close to true dual CPU performance because of resource
contention on the execution units, but better than single CPU
performance.
