Alright, since my last e-mail generated no interest, I thought
I'd refine my queries:
1. wake_up_interruptible()
I am reading
http://www.citi.umich.edu/projects/linux-scalability/reports/accept.html
and the my question is what solution to the "thundering herd" problem
was eventually chosen and is implemented in the 2.4.x kernels? Where
can I find more specific information on this implementation? Source
code references are welcome.
2. _syscall4
After reading 
http://www.kegel.com/c10k.html,
 I have to wonder
how exactly sendfile() was implemented in the 2.4.x kernels?
Where in the source can I find information? Is there any published
documentation on this subject as well?
3. PID table resizing
I understand that it is possible to resize the PID table in the
2.4.x kernels? Is this true or misinformation? If true, what do
I need to do? Is this a source edit, a compile-time configuration
option or a runtime option? If a source edit, which file(s)?
Thanks in advance!
