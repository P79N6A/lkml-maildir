CVS actually tends to make the problems USB has right now worse rather
than better. CVS works well in projects where there is someone prepared to
be chief pain in the butt and organiser (eg DaveM with sparc).
What USB needs is someone who will read all the USB patches and say
yes/no/later to them, and if need be is prepared to say no, get quoted a 
reason back and if its crap still say no
