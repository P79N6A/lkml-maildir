Probably nobody replied to Your message because people at this list think 
that Your problem isn't kernel related. In this moment I'm using "Arch Linux" 
too, so I checked /etc/cron directory. There simple jobs You are talking 
about are not so simple:
- update the "locate" database,
- update the "whatis" database.
Both jobs are scaning "/" partition. I don't know how dcron works, but I can 
imagine situation in which it is polling cron.daily and says: "hey it wasn't 
done today yet" and it is starting same jobs over and over again. More 
and more tasks scans the "/" partition and in result access is slower and 
slower.
