nope... the file size is 380 bytes or thereabouts maximum for sync,
which is the most complex of the three:
08048074 <.text>:
 8048074:       b8 24 00 00 00  movl   $0x24,%eax
 8048079:       cd 80           int    $0x80
 804807b:       b8 01 00 00 00  movl   $0x1,%eax
 8048080:       bb 00 00 00 00  movl   $0x0,%ebx
 8048085:       cd 80           int    $0x80
whether it's sheel script or otherwise, your still going to end up
with a file much less than 1K is size, so who cares?
Really, the space used is a non-issue. I don't buy drives of less
than 25GB nowdays if I can help it, so a few bytes here or these
matters not.

It still takes 1K on disk miniumum (or 4K on my disks, as I use 4K
block sizes almost everywhere)..
It wasn't the size the made me do this, is was more of a speed issue
on some nasty scripts I had somewhere, I did it for speed, and
because I was at one point installing linux on machines with 2MB of
ram....

I don't think RMS is silly enough to claim that true or false
contain enough non-trivial code to make any kind of copyright or
copyleft make sense.
