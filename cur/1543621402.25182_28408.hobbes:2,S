Not sure if this is related, but I still can't get 2.4 or 2.5 kernels to
actually read and write at the same time during a large file copy between
two totally separate devices (eg: from hda1 to hdc1).  "vmstat 1" shows
reads with no writing for about 6-8 seconds followed by writes with no
reading for about 5-6 seconds, repeat.
Is there a patch available that could fix this?
