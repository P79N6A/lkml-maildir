Look at the condition that follows: it disallows CLONE_DETACHED for 
non-threads.
Which really means that together with the first change, CLONE_DETACHED is 
always the same thing as CLONE_THREAD: you can't have one without the 
other. 
Which means that they are logically not separate bits any more, and we
should just get rid of CLONE_DETACHED altogether, and use CLONE_THREAD in
all cases where it is tested for.
I'd really prefer not to keep a bit around that has to mean the same thing 
as another bit - that way just lies madness. So I'll document 
CLONE_DETACHED as being a no-op, and change the _one_ place that used it 
to just use CLONE_THREAD instead.
