Pretty sure it was not to fix a bug, but to plug a possible security
issue with non-root users being able to do whatever they wanted on a R/W
FD.

No need to waste your time .. he did not want it to work properly on
Linux for years now, and the only reason Linux support have not been
removed yet, is because then it will break his 'O so wonderful and only
proper "schily" way for "protability to more plaforms than you get from
using an GNU autoconf the way the GNU people tell you"'.  Oh, and then
he looses his favourite "plaform" to rant about.
PS: quoted spelling mistakes are not a pun, its just to make sure I do
not get accused of being a liar ...
