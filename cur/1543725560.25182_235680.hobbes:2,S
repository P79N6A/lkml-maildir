thx for the report - i fixed this in the -I0 patch:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/voluntary-preempt/voluntary-preempt-2.6.8-rc2-I0
(the problem only occured when CONFIG_PREEMPT was enabled.)
-I0 also fixes two more softirq latency sources: rt_run_flush() (this
one got reported previously) and cache_reap().
-I0 boots up fine with CONFIG_PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY & CONFIG_PREEMPT
enabled.
