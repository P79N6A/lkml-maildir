Thanks so much for narrowing this down!

It might be related. Quick test to check: boot w/ "clocksource=acpi_pm"
and let me know if the problem still appears. Then try booting w/
"clocksource=tsc" and see if the system still corrects itself.

Hmm. Yea, the negative xtime nsec value is problematic. However the 1.5
seconds worth of nanoseconds that has accumulated is worrisome as well.

Yea, that bit is expected. Basically the cpufreq driver is loading, and
when we detect cpufreq changes we mark the TSC as unstable and we fall
back to an alternative clocksource (acpi_pm in your case). At the same
time, sched_clock sees that the TSC is unstable and it falls back to
using jiffies, which causes the small jump in the printk timestamps.
Thanks again for the testing and feedback!
