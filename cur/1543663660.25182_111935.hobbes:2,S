It'd be interesting to know where these processes are spending
their CPU time and why they're not catching their signals.

Strange, so sysrq-i manages to kill the processes, but the OOM
killer doesn't kill the processes ?
This is very suspect because the OOM killer uses force_sig in
the same way the sysrq-i handler does...
