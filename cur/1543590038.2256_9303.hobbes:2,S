Hi
Information in the README file says that when patching, the -p0 option is 
used with patch (eg tar xvzf <patch>.tar.gz | patch -p0). However I have 
never got this to work as I always get something like "can't find file to 
patch at line 5". However, replacing -p0 with -p1 seems to work perfectly.
Maybe the penguin doesn't like me, but still, whenever I've downloaded 
patches I had to say -p1, not -p0...
anyone else have to do this? If so, here's a wee patch for it.. (bear with 
me, it's my first one :)
