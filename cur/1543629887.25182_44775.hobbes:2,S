Hello ,
   I have a pseudo HBA LLD with the assicoated functions as in the
   SCSI HOST Template .Now we have a situation when the abort
   handler of the LLD is getting (eh_abort_handler) called early than
   we would desire it to be called !! Is there any way by which I can
   increase the delay after which the abort handler of our pseudo
   HBA LLD will be called by the mid level ??
   Thanks,
    Kaushik
