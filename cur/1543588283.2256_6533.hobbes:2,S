Well... 
Right now we can get a task killed by the OOM killer even if there is a
lot of _unused_ (but allocated) swap space. The reason for that is the
pre allocation of swap.
Practical example (128MB swap, 960MB ram): 
# fillmem 960 
...
   procs                      memory    swap          io     system cpu
 r  b  w   swpd   free   buff  cache  si  so    bi    bo   in    cs  us sy

Out of Memory: Killed process 763 (fillmem).
Around 60MB was written to swap, so there was unused swap space available,
which means the task should _not_ get killed.
We cannot simply check for "(swapper_space.nrpages > 0)" or count the
number of dirty swap cache pages to avoid the OOM killer from triggering,
obviously.
We can split the swap map in "used" / "allocated" bits (or something which
gives us that information), but that would be painful to do, I guess.
