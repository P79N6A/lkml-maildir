Thanks Rafael,
However, I need to send something upstream to Linus for this kernel
cycle, so I don't want to base it on an -mm patch.  There are two
alternatives, obviously: 1. send my patch in now based on the "change as
little as necessary to fix the immediate problem" and then rebase
Pavel's patch on top of mine, or 2. for me to send both Pavel's patch
and the rebased patch upstream.
Personally, I would prefer to avoid strategy 2 at this late stage in the
2.6.23-rc series.
Please let me know what you think.
