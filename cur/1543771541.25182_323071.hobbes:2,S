There's quite a few in there judging by the looks of the subjects
that aren't worth holding up the release imo.  Will the world
end if we dont ship 2.6.12 with support for Geode optimisation
for eg ?
Of the bugzillas...

Hmm. yet more oom-killer woes.
Some kind person from IBM pulled out a patch that we stuck in RHEL4
which does a sysrq-M at the time an oom kill occurs, which we've
found handy tracking down these. Might be worth including.
It got sent to the list late last week. I can dig it out if you
don't have it queued already.

I would go through some of the rest on the list, but I'm hungry :-)
