Please verify them if you have a couple of spare hours.
BTW: I measured similar results for the "scalability" patches on a 2.4.1 kernel, it
would be worth the effort to seriously compare them from an architectural point of
view, but I don't have the time right now...

Indeed, I'm using RT sigio/sigwait event scheduling, bare clone threads and
zero-copy io.
If only I had a really asynchronous sendfile, or a smarter madvise that wouldn't
require to map files :)
My server cannot execute dynamic stuff yet, it relies on Apache for that.
Running X15 and TUX in the same conditions (i.e. dynamic code in Apache) I get
exactly the same score in both cases.
I'm adding a TUX-like dynamic interface, I hope to get it to work by next week, then
I'll make a real confrontation.
