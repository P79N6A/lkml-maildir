Is there any sense in allowing a task to keep dirty a certain percentage
of free memory? If you have a task that has to be throttled amyway,
is any memory that this task keeps dirty wasted anyway, if it's more
than needed to send efficient io requests to the device? Somebody
else might have better uses for that memory.
