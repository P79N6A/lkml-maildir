The only way I can boot recent 2.5 kernels is to make sure my BIOS does 
nothing that even smells like ACPI. The only response I got so far on the 
lkml is "disable acpi support" and "disable apic support". The only 
conclusion I can make is that the ACPI support in 2.5 is buggy enough to 
prevent 2.5 to emerge into 2.6 for a long time from now, and unfortunately 
nobody seems to care. I detected big IRQ / ACPI / APIC trouble since about  
2.5.44 - 2.5.53, and nothing has changed since. 
NFI, I just don't understand that a core problem that prevents me from booting 
2.5 kernels, is noticed by so few others that it is able to remain unfixed 
for so long.
