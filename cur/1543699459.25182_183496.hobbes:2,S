I'm not talking about USB character devices. I'm not talking about
hot-plugging. For sure it will be very difficult or even impossible to
handle this kind of issues. I'm only talking about simple character
device drivers. Ok, you can remove the major/minor mechanism entirely from
Linux. Then we have a problem but I'm sure there will be some easy
workaround even then.
Best regards,
