Well, that certainly is a laudable goal.  At the moment, one usually has to 
resort to such things as POINTER variables and the like to get access to 
hugetlbpage segments.  Unfortunately, some of our experiments with the Intel 
compiler for ia64 have indicated  that the generated code can be significantly 
slower when arrays are referenced off of POINTER variables than when the same 
arrays are referenced out of COMMON, thus eliminating the performance gain of 
HUGETLB pages.
My question was really intended to address applying development effort to 
things that the users of hugetlbpages will likely actually use.  For example, 
it seems pointless to worry too much about demand paging of hugetlbpages out 
to disk.  Anyone who uses hugetlbpages for the performance boost they give 
will also likely have rightsized their problem or machine configuration to 
eliminate any swapping.
