Tricky though, because what if you want to hash more than 64 bits? You
have to somehow chain Jenkin's together.
Let H(a,b,c) be a jenkin's hash that does  '' mix(a,b,c) ; return a ''
Let a,b,c,d,e be inputs to be hashed, and R,S,T,U be random keys.
Its not safe to do anything like
 H(H(a,b,c),H(d,e,f),R)
Because an attacker can brute-force to find tuples (a,b,c),
(a',b',c'), ... so that H(a,b,c) == H(a',b',c') == ....
A better approach (which I make with no formal analysis of its
quality) might be to construct this:
 H(a,b,R) ^ H(c,d,S) ^ H(e,f,T)
Perhaps the best approach is to visit Usenix Security 2003 this August
and ask the experts there.
