There isn't any leak.
I suppose the X server and window manager actually do have current
levels from a kernel viewpoint, but they also have capability bits
that let them freely change level. They are Trusted.
To the user, the window manager should appear to not have any
particular level at all. This may well be implemented by changing
level, just as a userspace NFS server appears to operate without
any particular UID.

What is not part of CMW?
If you mean "feature is actually well thought out and usable" then
of course I agree, and I don't care. Nobody but a PHB would want
to install a poorly designed system that just happens to barely
meet the minimum requirements.
If you mean something about checkboxes, you should read the above
text a second time knowing that the "checkbox" is not something
you see on your computer screen. The checkbox is mental; it refers
to the way someone might compare systems for purchase. Like this:
[x]  has CMW
[x]  meets POSIX
[ ]  looks like Win95
[x]  fits the budget
[ ]  easy to use
[ ]  tech support has clearance
[x]  our admin is already trained

No kidding, and you don't need a stack for that.

OK, so only the visible representation can be spoofed. If so, then
the visible representation isn't useful --> it can be eliminated.

Who said anything about it being OK to mix data? Being "secure"
in this case means not confusing the user with spoofed windows.
If you could rely on the user to check what security level will
receive keyboard input, you'd only need a single Trusted Pixel.

No, that is just an implementation problem. Elimination of this
problem DOES NOT imply that data from separate levels can be
freely mixed.

What "target software" do you refer to?
If something is unknown or unsupported, you fail. You can't
expect two totally different systems to fully trust each other.
This does not prevent operation between cooperating hosts.

Sure it does.
The remote tty level change causes the remote ssh server to query
back, through a trusted network, to the trusted ssh client.
The local ssh client can, assuming the process group checks out,
deal with the local pty and through that change request influence
the local xterm. Should the xterm refuse, the initial tty level
change on the remote pty (still blocked) will fail.
The TCP/IP connection could be made to change level, or one could
simply rely on ssh and sshd being Trusted. There won't be any leaks
because you trust ssh and sshd to manage the security data correctly.
Evil clients would not have access to the right keys, so they fail.
Evil hosts don't get put on your network I hope, and in any case the
IP-layer encryption should solve that problem.

If "script" is not trusted, it will be unable to cooperate
with ssh to change the pty security level. This will cause
ssh to return an error code to the remote system.

No problem, because "su" will know about the failure.

Validation is simple. Every bit of software along the link is
required to perform an acknowledgment which can only be done
by trusted software.
If you put "something the user wrote" in your TCB with all the
capability bits it could want, you get what you deserve.
