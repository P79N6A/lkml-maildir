no... I'm copying user-memory to user-memory, not kernel-to-user, however 
running the code in kernel-mode.
what i wanted to know is how to check the access-rights...
i didn't get any other answers, so for now i'm just using 
if (access_ok(VERIFY_READ, from, PAGE_SIZE) &&
    access_ok(VERIFY_WRITE, to, PAGE_SIZE))
{
    memcpy(to, from, PAGE_SIZE);
}
and hope that this is the *correct* way to do it...
