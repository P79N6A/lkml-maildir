I agree your patch also solves the problem.
Either way is fine. Even Hugh's patch almost does the same thing as
yours. The only advantage with my page is it does the calculation in
only one place and does not repeat it. Also I feel its more intuitive to
assume that index 0 covers range 0 to 4095 i.e index n covers range
n*PAGE_SIZE to ((n+1)*PAGE_SIZE)-1.  Currently the code assumes index 0
covers range 1 to 4096  i.e index n covers range (n*PAGE_SIZE)+1 to
(n+1)*PAGE_SIZE. 
this is the 4th time we are trying to nail down the same thing. We
better get it right this time. So any correct patch is ok with me.
