Yes, you can. Booting with psmouse.proto=bare will force the touchpad
into standard PS/2 mode. You may also try booting with
psmouse.proto=imps and psmouse.proto=exps - maybe one of these 2 will
give you virtual scrolling.
If psmouse is compiled as a module you will have to add
	options psmouse proto=bare
to your /etc/modprobe.conf
Btw, what device/protocol are you using in X? I'd advise setting it
to "dev/input/mice" and "ExplorerPS/2" so if your touchad is indeed
sending scroll events X would use them. Could you post your config,
please?
Thanks!
