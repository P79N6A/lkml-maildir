That's a weirdness we haven't solved yet. Part of the problem is
that a common kernel can boot pmac, chrp and prep, and the later
ones can use the drivers/char/rtc.c driver. Actually, the
drivers/macintosh/rtc.c one may work on these too as it's just
a wrapper on some platform code selected at runtime depending on
the machine class.
Now, regarding the support of only GET/SET ioctls, it's normal.
Some of these machines don't have the legacy PC hardware RTC with
alarm support etc... That's the case of macs where the RTC hardware
is purely a real time clock. (It has other features, like scheduled
power up, but these aren't implemented yet and could be done entirely
in userland using /dev/adb anyway).
So the driver in drivers/macintosh/rtc.c is just a wrapper on the
get/set time functions provided by each type of machine.
Ben.
