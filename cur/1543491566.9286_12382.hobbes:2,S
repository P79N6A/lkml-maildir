Thanks Alan,
I got it to work "as expected".
No problem besides throughput ca 150 Kb/sec on a Pentium 133 and a
decent scsi hard drive :-/ - despite USLEEP* tweaking. A bit strange.
I can initialize dtc3181e card in PnP mode (isapnp - fine)
"with an irq", but it does not produce interrupts anyway, seems so.
Is there any info on programming the DTCT-436P (and similar) chip?
I can think it wants some magic init to make it produce irqs
on hardware events. There is nothing like that in the generic driver.
[well, irq lines on my card are wired to the chip at least - it *may* work
:]
Happy hacking,
