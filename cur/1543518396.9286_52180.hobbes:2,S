I'd have to scour the wine source to verify that.

Positive.  The kernel stack pointer isn't set with the K6's MSR, which
is unfortunate.  Only %cs, %ss, and the kernel entry point are set. 
%esp still points to the userspace stack after SYSCALL and must be
reloaded with the kernel's stack manually, which will be very tricky in
an SMP environment if/when Athlon SMP systems appear.
There are two versions of the SYSCALL support.  Version 1 is on the K6
and K6-2's before stepping 8, and version 2 is later K6-2s, the K6-3,
and I presume the Athlon.  My testing was done with version 1.  I now
have a K6-2 with the version 2 support and I will run some tests later
tonight.  As far as I know, the only difference between versions is in
how %cs and %ss are set upon SYSRET.
