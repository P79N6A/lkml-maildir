Given a size distribution of 2^n the worst slack space is 100% - see how
allocations of (2^m) + 1 will always need 2^(m+1) bytes.
lim_{n -> inf} (2^(n+1)/((2^n)+1)) = 
2^lim_{n -> inf} ((n+1)-n) = 2^1 = 2

No it doesn't.

And how do we know a page was taken out of the reserves?
This is done by looking at page->reserve (overload of page->index) and
this value can be destroyed as soon as its observed. It is in a sense an
extra return value.

A slab page obtained from the reseserve will never serve an object to an
unprivilidged allocation.

Yeah, there were some objections to the size of it.
