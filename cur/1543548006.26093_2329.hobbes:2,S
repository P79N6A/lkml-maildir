Well, on the bit functions set_bit() and test_and_clear_bit(), the macro
inserts an appopriate locking instruction into the assembly.
On the wait queue, the wait_queue structure includes

How does a second process know when a first process has created one, unless
its name is published. And if you do it that way, they then have to negotiate
in some way to elevate it to a kernel object.

Currently each the handle map for each process is restricted to a single page
less a header. This places a rough limit on the number of objects to number of
processes (not threads) * ~1020. Additionally, some objects (like mutexes) can
beshared and so several handle map entries point to a single object.
However, a hard limit can easily be imposed, and may best be.
