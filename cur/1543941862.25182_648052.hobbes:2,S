I still don't seem to fully understand what is happening here -- aparently 
this is triggerable only with old programs linked against libc.so.5, and I 
am not able to trigger it with my trivial program when I link it against 
old libc.so.5, which just basically does brk() and checks whether 
/proc/<pid>/maps are OK. Seems to me that (at least certain versions) of 
libc.so.5 (wrongly) assume that end of the bss is the start of the heap, 
but I will try to investigate it more.
Ingo, the code in commit c1d171a0029 is IMHO funcionalli identical to 
your exec-shield in fedora kernels, so even libc.so.5-linked binaries on 
any Fedora distro should trigger this bug ... (or you can use the binary 
that Pavel supplied). Haven't tried this yet.
Thanks,
