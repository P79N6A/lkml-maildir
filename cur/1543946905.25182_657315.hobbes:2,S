Subject: [PATCH] Add the DFF (Desktop Form Factor) Dell Optiplex 745 to the reboot errata list, where the SFF one lives right now
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Hi,
We recently got some of the "Desktop Form Factor" Optiplex 745's in. I
noticed that there's an entry for the SFF one's, but the BIOS model
number of the DFF differs from that of the SFF. We have been reliably
experiencing the same (as far as I can tell) reboot bug as the SFF boxes.
Please accept the attached patch (made against 2.6.23.16 sources) for
review.
