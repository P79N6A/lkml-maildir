Is this guaranteed by the SCSI standards or do you need to issue some
kind of cache flush as with IDE ?

That will work nicely with the I2O controllers, and possibly (if its
in the firmware as well as the .h file) the aacraid cards. In those
cases I can often commit to battery backed ram rather than physical
media.
Do you have any idea of driving the cache write through rather than write
back is likely to help here by evening out the commit wait for a flush?
