Okay, I'm royally puzzled why that would be.  I've gone over the code 
quite a few times, and I do not see any way (other than VESA < 2.0) that 
could cause that.
I look forward to getting the debug output; depending on what it is we 
might have to get some debugging output from the setup code.
We can printf in the new setup code, although obviously that requires 
leaving the screen in text mode.  However, EDID information should still 
be available.
