From Linus' 2.5.60 announcement:

>  o 3c509 fixes: correct MCA probing, add back ISA probe to Space.c
This is somewhat broken. patch-2.5.60 has

but (a) there's no declaration for el3_probe() in scope at this
point, leading to a compile error, and (b) el3_probe() is still
'static' in 3c509.c, leading to a linkage error (assuming a
declaration for el3_probe() was added to Space.c to fix (a) first)
Reverting the patch to Space.c solved the problem for me.
Why the probe list entry? Isn't the module_init() in 3c509.c enough?
