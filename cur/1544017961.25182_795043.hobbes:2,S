Subject: [PATCH 1/1] edac: remove EDACs experimental status
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

From: Doug Thompson <dougthompson@xmission.com>
After 3 years, this is a patch to remove the EXPERIMENTAL tag on EDAC.
We now have many module drivers submitters in EDAC and believe EDAC
is no longer EXPERIMENTAL
