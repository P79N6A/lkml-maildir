  Have a look at the details available on AMD's web site,  it seems
to have the required info - assuming they don't change it before release.
  While adding support now to linux is all well and good,  it may be an
idea to start on the tool chains first - binutils,  gcc,  etc since in
long mode - where you'd want the kernel to run - the instruction set has
had some small changes.
  Also testing this lot will be interesting without hardware - the tool
chain could (in theory) be checked via inspection,  however I suspect
there will be quite a bit of crash and burn before it goes.
