And do you think it works well because of all those companies that
don't contribute anything back? For that matter, do they do a single
thing to help anyone or anything to do with Linux except themselves?

Opinions or motivations, or the people working for companies don't really
have any relevance at all. What matters is their actions.
You would think that those people who think their IP is so priceless that
it can't be opened would respect the rights of others. Sadly that doesn't
appear to be the case.

Linux has become popular _in spite_ of parasites, rather than because of
them. The main reason for its popularity is its quality. And a big reason
for its quality is the GPL.
