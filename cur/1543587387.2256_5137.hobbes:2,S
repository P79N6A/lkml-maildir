	Folks, IMO ext2-dir-patch got to the stable stage. Currently
it's against 2.4.4-pre2, but it should apply to anything starting with
2.4.2 or so.
	Ted, could you review it for potential inclusion into 2.4 once
it gets enough testing? It's ext2-only (the only change outside of
ext2 is exporting waitfor_one_page()), it doesn't change fs layout,
it seriously simplifies ext2/dir.c and ext2/namei.c and it gives better
VM behaviour.
	Patch is on ftp.math.psu.edu/pub/viro/ext2-dir-patch.gz
	Folks, please give it a good beating - it works here, but I'd
really like it to get wide testing. Help would be very welcome.
