Hello.
I have a problem with one news server (feeder) box running INN.
Under heavy load i get the following error on the console:
filemap.c:2084: bad pmd 2bc001e3
This showed few times during last few days and few times server 'hanged up'
after this.
Anyone has an idea what can cause it?
I'm using Linux Debian on dual PIII 1.1Ghz, 1GB RAM, LVM version 1.0.6,
Qlogic FC 2200F driver version 6.01
Any help would be apreciated...
