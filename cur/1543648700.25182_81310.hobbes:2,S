So how does it harm the mainline kernel to have a system call reserved for LSM 
and then not allow anything in the mainline kernel that uses it?  Then we can 
deploy modules using the current LSM design without harming the mainline 
kernel.
The only code that we really want to see in the mainline kernel is the hooks 
for permission checks.  Personally I would not mind if no security module 
ever gets included in Linus' source tree.
Disclaimer:  This message is my own opinion, even if I was part of "team LSM" 
I would not be representing them in this issue.
