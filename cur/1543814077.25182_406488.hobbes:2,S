If you are using an e2fsprogs older than version 1.38, you should try
expanding the journal size from the default of 32M to 128M; with the
filesystem unmounted do:
	tune2fs -O ^has_journal /dev/hdXX
	tune2fs -O has_journal -J journal_size=128 /dev/hdXX
If the journal gets full and the filesystem has to do a forced journal
truncate, that can cause I/O's to stall and writes can thus get bursty
with performance becoming nasty as a result.  Increasing the journal
size can avoid this, at the cost of potentially having more disk
buffers be pinned in memory, thus increasing the overhead of
unswappable kernel memory.
