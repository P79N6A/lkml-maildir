You limit the functionality, so it's not the case.

Yeah, I can agree with this statement. However, as it turns out, the 
latest David's core eliminates this issue.

If there's more than one SPI controller onboard, spi_write_then_read 
will serialize the transfers related to two different controllers what 
will have significant negative impact on the transfer speed (so DMA 
won't help increasing the speed in this case). Moreover, if, say, two 
kernel threads with different priorities are working with two SPI 
controllers respectively *priority inversion* will happen.
You might also want to learn more about real-time systems 
characterictics such as priority inversion, BTW.

Nope, it's just a default policy.

Main are
- the need to call 'complete' in controller driver
- the need to implement policy in controller driver
