It is funny that I couldn't get it work.  Files are checked with "vi" and
"emacs" to ensure the last character in the line is "\".  Also I tried to
delete the rest of line including "\" and added "\" to the end of line after
that, compiler complains the same thing.  Any idea?

Its quite happy with them. Make sure you don't have other bogus symbols
after the \ - especially if you are copying DOS files and not fixing
the end of line markers
