__inline__ and __asm__ are fine for ANSI; they are gcc macros. Their purpose
is to allow portable headers using the gcc inline and asm keywords. C++
doesnt mind the gcc "inline" keyword, and it probably even does the right
thing most of the time. Kernel headers using __inline__ are not a problem.
Many kernel headers use "extern inline" raw. C++ doesnt mind, egcs
understands it, but "gcc -ansi" will puke.

I don't think rewriting the kernel is the issue. Obtaining prototypes of
exported symbols is the main reason people include headers.

Will you consider accepting header patches for ansification?
