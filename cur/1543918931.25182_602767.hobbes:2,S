By the way, I agree that this is the best approach. Feasibly, it could be used 
by the same splash engines you mention to colour their console redirect, 
though most of the engines I've seen (e.g. SuSE/Ubuntu) don't let you switch 
messages on until after init (at which point kernel colours are probably 
irrelevant).
