After looking at the scheduler timing I was thinking it might be a fair
trade off to convert sched_clock to return cycles instead of converting
to nanosecond each time it reads .. 
I'm just probing for anyone thoughts on this ..
I'm not promoting a specific implementation, but I would think the
tuning nobs would have to stay in nanosecond, but everything else would
be converted to cycles ..
