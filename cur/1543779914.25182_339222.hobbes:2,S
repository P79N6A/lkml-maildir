Sorry that I can't help. I actually have a machine that's Oops'ing
during software suspend (with suspend2). I typed it all up last night,
which was terribly time-consuming. I have another laptop, but it
doesn't have any serial ports. I've tried taking pictures, but you
can't read the text.
How did you get that image? With a scan-converter?
Thanks.
