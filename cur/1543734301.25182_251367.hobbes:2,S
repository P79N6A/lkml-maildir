Feel free to suggest other ways to discover lg(n) at compile-time.

No, it DTRT. Batching does not directly compensate for increases in
arrival rates, rather most directly compensates for increases to lock
transfer times, which do indeed increase on systems with large numbers
of cpus.

A 511 item pagevec is 4KB on 64-bit machines.

The results I got suggest the tests will not be significantly different
unless the machines differ significantly in the overhead of acquiring a
cacheline in an exclusive state.

Unsurprising. If the expected response time given batching factor K is
T(K) (which also depends on the lock transfer time) T(K)/(K*T(1)) may
have nontrivial maxima and minima in K. I've tried for the expected
waiting time of a few queues (e.g. M/M/1) and verified it's not a
degradation for them, though I've not gone over it in generality
(G/G/m is hard to get results of any kind for anyway). I refrained from
posting a lengthier discussion of the results.
