Yes. Especially if m is 2 or 1. A scatterlist on 64-bit x86 looks like
it takes 32 bytes, which means 128 elements fit on a page. One more
spills - ouch!
But maybe chaining means this doesn't matter any more. Maybe we can
even pick a nice moderate sg size and reduce the number of mempools we
need for these things.
