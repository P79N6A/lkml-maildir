Umm, guys?
This proposal disturbs me.  I find the following exchange particularly
bothersome:

Now maybe I'm just biased by my validation experience, but the attitude I
always take is "it's broken unless demonstrated otherwise".  I've had people
describe LILO as a loaded gun.  Ucode patch is a nuclear reactor.  If a
vendor says, "Don't do a ucode patch after doing X", then we had better not
try a ucode patch after doing X.  I know that we like to do uptime
competitions, but a ucode patch can be a bigger deal than a minor stepping
of a cpu--and no one complains about having to reboot their system when they
change processors. :-))
I don't feel that avoiding a reboot is worth risking the damage caused by a
failed hot-patch, particularly if the user MUST do a hot-patch.
