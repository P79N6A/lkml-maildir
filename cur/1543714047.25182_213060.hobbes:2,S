Ciao,
Philippe did it, likely the first real time Linux-2.6.
So at the RTAI home site: 
http://www.aero.polimi.it/~rtai/,
 you'll find
rtai-3.1-test1 for both Linux 2.4.xx and 2.6.x.
 From the content point of view it is what you'll find in 3.0r3, with
some glitches discovered in between ironed off. There is a very
important and significant change however: the death of the RTHAL way of
working for ix86 machines. That alone sets a milestone in RTAI life.
So RTAI i386 will work just on ADEOS and nothing else.
It should be remarked once more that RTAI is 4 things now (in
alphbetical order): FUSION/RTAI/RTAILab/XENOMAI.
A particular note should be reserved to FUSION and I hope that Philippe
will find time to advertise it a bit more in the near future. With
FUSION RTAI has an almost continuous grading of real time requirements:
soft (standard Linux), firm (Linux low latency), hard-1 FUSION, hard-2
LXRT, hard-3 kernel. In my opinion it is likely that a well matured
FUSION will become a key player for many users.
BTW, do not activate the low latency option in Linux 2.6 for a while
more. It is also likely you'll have problems with SMP. After all it is
test1 only :-).
At the moment the known problems with this new RTAI are mine. In fact
I've not made  netrpc working yet. For the rest most user space examples
in showroom seems to be OK under UP, but examples involving kernel
modules do not even compile. The core RTAI testsuite works well however
in both kernel and user space.
So give a try, have fun and help to make it better.
Happy Easter.
Paolo.
