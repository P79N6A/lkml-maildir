C was created to develope the UNIX operating system that's why it has got
many features to support hardware related problems (bit fields, union,
easy logical operators etc etc). Because Linux is a UNIX like OS, the best
test for C is compiling Linux ... Writing a C compiler in C is nice but
it can be done with many other programming languages too. But writing an
OS is tipically a C related problem IMHO.
