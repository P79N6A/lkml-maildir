  Well, shouldn't we rather fix what journal_start_commit() returns?
The interface which returns 1 when a transaction is already committing or
a transaction commit has just been started but 0 when we race with
somebody staring the commit is fairly unusable. Moreover
ext3_force_commit() will unnecessarily create new sync transaction and
commit it if there's no transaction running which is quite expensive
(even merging empty sync handle is not for free because of sync
transaction batching). But this is minor problem since we probably
don't care too much about sync() performance - BTW this is probably a
cause for bug 12224, isn't it?
  BTW: ocfs2 would need fixing as well if done your way since it's
sync_fs function has been copied over from ext3.
  To summarized I'd rather see a patch like below (untested) going in
and your patch reverted... Opinions? I can cookup a JBD2 version of
the patch in case we agree to go this way.

Subject: [PATCH] jbd: Fix return value of journal_start_commit()
journal_start_commit() returns 1 if either a transaction is committing or the
function has queued a transaction commit. But it returns 0 if we raced with
somebody queueing the transaction commit as well. This resulted in
ext3_sync_fs() not functioning correctly (description from Arthur Jones):
In the case of a data=ordered umount with pending long symlinks which are
delayed due to a long list of other I/O on the backing block device, this
causes the buffer associated with the long symlinks to not be moved to the
inode dirty list in the second phase of fsync_super.  Then, before they can be
dirtied again, kjournald exits, seeing the UMOUNT flag and the dirty pages are
never written to the backing block device, causing long symlink corruption and
exposing new or previously freed block data to userspace.
This can be reproduced with a script created by Eric Sandeen
<sandeen@redhat.com>:
        #!/bin/bash
        umount /mnt/test2
        mount /dev/sdb4 /mnt/test2
        rm -f /mnt/test2/*
        dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/test2/bigfile bs=1M count=512
        touch /mnt/test2/thisisveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryverylongfilename
        ln -s /mnt/test2/thisisveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryverylongfilename
        /mnt/test2/link
        umount /mnt/test2
        mount /dev/sdb4 /mnt/test2
        ls /mnt/test2/
This patch fixes journal_start_commit() to always return 1 when there's
a transaction committing or queued for commit.
