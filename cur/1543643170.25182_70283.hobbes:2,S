Nope, that's one of the two problems.  Read my previous post: the
other is partial initialization.
Your patch is two-stage delete, with the additional of a usecount
function.  So you have to move the usecount from the module to each
object it registers: great for filesystems, but I don't think it buys
you anything (since they were easy anyway).
Moreover, I don't see where your patch prevented someone increasing
the module count during try_unregister_module(), so that check is
pointless (do it in userspace unless they specify rmmod -f).
Alexey said we needed two-stage module delete back in 1999, so this is
not a new idea...
