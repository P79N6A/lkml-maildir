Perhaps after 2.6.n is out and stable for a month or so someone could
look at the problem. Certainly the various io schedulers are good
candidates for being optional and/or modules. The problem is that the
parts which aren't needed aren't large, so you may not gain much.
Clearly you have to have *some* io scheduler, I'm not sure if sysfs is
optional in any meaningful way any more. I haven't tried running w/i
/proc in a few months, it didn't work when I did, but old kernels are
old news.
