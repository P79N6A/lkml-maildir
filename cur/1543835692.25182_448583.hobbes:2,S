> Paul can you please test the mainline code and confirm?
Sure - which version of Linus and/or Andrew's tree is the minimum
worth testing?
Could you explain why you don't think the mainline has this
problem?  I still see the critical code piece there:
  #ifdef CONFIG_NUMA
                if (cpus_weight(*cpu_map)
                                > SD_NODES_PER_DOMAIN*cpus_weight(nodemask)) {
What other critical bugs are fixed between the SLES10 variant
and the mainline?
