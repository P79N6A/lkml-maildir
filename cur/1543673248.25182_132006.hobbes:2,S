Work -- no.  Thought?  A little.  Seems to me that MSIs need to be treated
as a third form of interrupts (level/edge/message).  The address that
the MSI will write to is clearly architecture dependent (may even be
irq-controller-dependent, depending on your architecture).  request_irq()
is an insufficient function to deal with this -- request_msi() may be
needed instead.  It'll need to return an address to pass to the card.
(We need a mechanism to decide whether it's a 32-bit or 64-bit address).
Oh, and don't make this too PCI-specific -- native PARISC interrupts
are MSI and you can see how handled it in arch/parisc/kernel/irq.c.

Might do, might not.
