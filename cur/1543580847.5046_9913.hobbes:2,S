i have two ewrk3 cards here.  if you want stuff tested that can
certainly be arranged, as i'd like to use them.  (i used them with 2.2,
they worked very well)
unfortunately can't test both cards in one machine until i install
linux on a box with more than one isa slot.  maybe a project for
tomorrow :-)
