Subject: [RFC] expand_resource()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

We have a situation where we descend through the resource tree and
figure out that firmware has set up the resources wrongly.  This patch
allows us to grow our parent's resource to accommodate our requirements.
I'm looking for feedback at this point, not application, so I've mangled
the patch to make it hard to apply.
