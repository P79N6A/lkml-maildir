Actually, pure struct-member renames are not that common, however it  
_is_ common to add an accessor method due to upcoming locking/ 
virtualization changes or similar.  For that case (Using a random  
recent example from the list.  This was decided to not be the best  
route for pid virtualization, but it's just an example):
struct task_struct {
	[...]
	
	pid_t pid;
	
	[...]
};
This would become:
struct task_struct {
	[...]
	
	union {
		pid_t pid __deprecated;
		pid_t __internal_pid;
	};
	
	[...]
};
static inline pid_t task_pid(struct task_struct *t) {
	return t->__internal_pid;
}
Code that used task->pid would get a deprecation warning, however new  
code that used the task_pid(task) would work fine; and the task_pid()  
function itself would generate no warnings.
Cheers,

definition, not smart enough to debug it.
