Thank you for the pointer. I will look at it and see if I can try to port 
it to x86_64, since that is the standard and official way. I admit that I 
didn't realize that the "magic stuff" which gdb does is in fact a dwarf2 
implementation (and this is what's missing in kdb on x86_64).
Kind regards
Tigran
