Yes, you need the SCSI Tape stuff (either as a module or compiled 
in).
Mine 'just works'.....you have a number of choices as to how you use 
it.
Upon boot, you should see that the SCSI has detected the tape drive 
and assigned it an identity (st0 normally).
Once you see that, you can use dump/restore, taper, dd, cpio to talk 
to the tape drive.
If using dump, you will need to figure out some parameters to get the 
best out of the drive. If you just dump /dev/st0 whatever, it will 
not fit much on the tape.
Regards,
Brad.
