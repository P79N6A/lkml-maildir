Hi all,
I have a quick question.
I'm trying to resurrect a patch from the Linux-tiny patch suite,
to do accounting of kmalloc memory allocations.  In testing it
with Linux 2.6.22, I've found a large number of kfrees of
NULL pointers.
Is this considered OK?  Or should I examine the offenders
to see if something is coded badly?
Thanks,
 -- Tim
