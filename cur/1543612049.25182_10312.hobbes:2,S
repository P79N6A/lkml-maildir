Yes but typically this also includes a step of reflashing firmware or
swaping of firmware...So it would not be unrealistic to swap out the
filesystem as well...
Since in a deployment situation you will always be sticking with one endianness 
it makes sense that you would want the most speed for your buck...Since flash 
filesystems are slow to begin with also adding in the decompression
hit you get from cramfs...it would seem to me that adding in le<->be
would just add to its speed reduction....That would seem to be a good
place to trim the fat so to speak...
Just My humble oppinion
