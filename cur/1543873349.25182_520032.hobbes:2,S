Subject: [PATCH 1/1] Allow i386 crash kernels to handle x86_64 dumps
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/3/14/276

The specific case I am encountering is kdump under Xen with a 64 bit
hypervisor and 32 bit kernel/userspace. The dump created is a 64 bit due
to the hypervisor but the dump kernel is 32 bit to match the domain 0
kernel.
It's possibly less likely to be useful in a purely native scenario but I
see no reason to disallow it.
