I have seen problems in the past, the "forget to deal with default
values for new options" for example. It is possible that menuconfig
has been fixed since then, but when you start getting lots of bug
reports from people because they ran some strange thing instead of
oldconfig you get really annoyed and tell your users to use what you
know works.

I suspect most developers use the methods, they are nice and have
always been reliable. Whether new ones are more convenient is highly
discussable ;-)
