I was not talking about sysdevs. I was talking about platform devices
that are already being created for pcspkr by arch code. Now I want
arch code to provide a spinlock for pcspkr driver to use when
accessing PIT. What it does it allows to remove arch specific
knowledge (i.e. #ifdef CONFIG_X86...) from the pcspkr driver.
