I have exported the symbol, can access it, and it works.

No, not at all. This driver must use all available memory. Then it
must release it. This is not a 'multiuser system' this is a control
system that must get a lot of data fast.

No, the user is the machine. There is not a sysadmin, there isn't
even 'init' the application owns the entire machine. The driver is
an interface between the application and the hardware using kernel
privs and resources. The driver handles the interface between all
'foreign' hardware and the API, though the kernel.
The application, not 'init' mounts the file-systems, starts the
network(s), etc., it is not a SysV interface. In fact, except to
aid development and debugging, there isn't even a shell.
As Linux replaces Suns and Alphas , you will find more linux machines are
being used to control some pretty sophisticated stuff like real Flight
Simulators, Process controllers, High-Speed data acquisition
systems, CAT Scanners, Bomb Scanners, X-Ray spectrometers, etc.
In a few months Tweenkies will be made using Linux. Trust me, it's
in the works.
