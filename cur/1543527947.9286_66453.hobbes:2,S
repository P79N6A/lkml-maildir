This is stupid, since the maintainers can't help people, if they
do not understand the reported error messages. Or would you like
to switch to numbers for each message, which has to be decoded
manually?

This is German i18n. If someone submits sth. to linux-kernel, you
generally have to _guess_ which langauage his kernel messages
have, which would take even more time just to get the error
messages.
So, please stop i18n of these things! 
Computer Scientists all over the world can live with everything
being English, because they are used to it. Most of the other
contributors understand the necessity of a single language for
kernel stuff, too.
The only thing, that _should_ be translated is the docs and and
the configure scripts (esp. the help texts).
Translated error messages clearly slow down bug recognition. And
for me (and some other people) German (or lets say "native
language") error messages are really confusing, because I'm used
to the English ones, and my brain expects these known pattern ;)
So I switched to LANG=C to get the real messages.
The "Tower of Babel" showed us, how evil separate languages are
for getting real work done ;)
Stop i18n of kernel messages, stop confusing people!
