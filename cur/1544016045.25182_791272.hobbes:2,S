Yes, for this special case that is correct.

Indeed, this method introduces a kind of artificial interrupt sharing.
The trade-off here is, having a reliably working system with the
possibility of slightly increased interrupt sharing rather than a system
that shows all kinds of nasty behaviors as Ingo pointed out.
How much of a performance hit gives interrupt sharing anyway? Does
anybody have some numbers?

Well, it shouldn't be that bad. Mind you this only applies to
non-primary IO-APICs. These IO-APICs are usually used to handle a
separate bus, which usually only has a few devices hanging around.

You might end up invoking the same ISR twice. Once by the original IRQ
followed by a Boot Interrupt that is generated during masked interrupt
handling.

Don't you think that would clutter /proc/interrupts? The other question
I have, is that really worth the effort? Another thing that comes to
mind is, what if there is no other device on the interrupt line where
INTA, INTB, etc. end up. Would you want to permanently unmask all these
interrupt lines in case a Boot Interrupt shows up even if there are no
devices on the interrupt lines? The whole case is pretty tricky.
