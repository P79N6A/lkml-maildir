No, I have just try it but I don't see any changes.
My question is about a strange change of "behaviour" in IDE performance 
changing readahead.
Here I report a new thing that I've noticed today:
Kernel 2.6.0:
o readahead up to 224:
when I run "hdparm -t /dev/hda" the HD LED light up... and after a while 
light down
o readahead > 224:
running "hdparm" the HD LED starts blinking... and then light down
The best performance are riched with values between 128 and 224 --> IOW when 
the HD led starts blinking the performance diminish...
Kernel 2.6.1-rc1:
the HD LED starts to blink with readahead = 16 !!!
Why?
