Hrm, you are not protecting about "asynchronous" (interrupt based)
activity anyway... I'm not sure how the IO sceduler may kill us
and whatever doing things based on a timer that doesn't have a
device-driver underneath getting the PM callbacks.
As far as suspend-to-disk is concerned, I agree we need a state
snapshot, then we need to be able to play with drivers to save that
state without having userland get in the way, so yup, we need a
freezer. I think we don't need it for suspend-to-ram though.

Ok.
