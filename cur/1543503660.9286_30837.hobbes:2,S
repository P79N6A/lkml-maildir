Most of the core system libraries were in ROM, but that isn't the
issue. They were closed source, in ROM or on disk. Probably well over
90% of the programs that used SetFunction() were not official
Commodore programs (SetPatch being just about the only one), but were
programs written by external developers who needed to fix a bug, or
hack the system for added functionality. As I understand it, you could
replace a function that was in a library stored on disk, not just the
ones in ROM.
