The GPLv2 doesn't have to cover this distinction to make it a reality. This 
distinction is *EXACTLY* the type of distinction a lawyer will make when 
arguing the point.
Yes, it's artificial. Yes, it does appear to violate the GPLv2 - *IF* you read 
the text of such in a specific manner. 
However, the GPL, until version 3, *NEVER* guaranteed the right to run a given 
piece of software on *ANY* hardware - not the hardware it *COMES* on. 
And please, I repeated myself only because your reply seemed to imply that you 
didn't understand the statement I had made. Since you have now informed me, 
in a backhanded way, informed me that my interpretation of your response was 
wrong, I will not repeat myself again.
Also note that I have re-examined the facts, in light of new information 
presented in this discussion, and have come to the conclusion that devices 
like the TiVO, in keeping the signing keys private (because of 
the "Facilitation of a Crime" thing I noted earlier), is violating the GPL, 
but not in the manner almost everyone is arguing. The violation is, rather, 
with the clause about the license being null and void in event of laws 
impacting the delivery of the source. (Because, as I also stated earlier, the 
signing keys are part of the source. Since, in some cases, the license on the 
hardware prevents running modified binaries (a reason for the digital 
signing) companies will keep said keys private - doing otherwise can (and I 
can assure you that some lawyer will do this) be construed as "Facilitating 
the Commission of a crime". In this case, it'd be "Breach of Contract" - 
IANAL, but IIRC, licenses fall under contract law))
