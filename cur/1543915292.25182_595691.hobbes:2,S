There are other considerations that differs between the boot-time case
and the general "init" case: the write-protection flag must be
cleared-saved/restored when the kernel is running to patch read-only
text, but we don't want to modify cr0 at early boot on i386 because
paravirt is not executed yet (at boot time, pages are not
write-protected yet).
And I am not sure that it buys us anything to create an immediate_init()
when we can do exactly the same job with immediate_set. Yes, it might be
a bit slower, but we are not on a fast path.

Yes, immediate values are used by the Linux Kernel Markers, which
instrument many code paths, including functions called from nmi and mce
contexts (including printk).

Yes, doing arch specific calls without gcc support seems to be unlikely
to give us a neat portable solution.
