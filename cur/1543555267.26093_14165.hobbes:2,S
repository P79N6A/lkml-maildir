You mean this?
	hde: timeout waiting for DMA
	ide_dmaproc: chipset supported ide_dma_timeout func only: 14
I see identical hangs when I have a similar IBM-DTLA drive attached 
anywhere on the HPT366. But I also see it hang on 2.2.17 if I try:
 hdparm -t /dev/hde & hdparm -t /dev/hde & hdparm -t /dev/hde
a few times. This is even with Andre's latest patch.
For now, I've just moved the IBM drive onto the PIIX4, where it's stable. My 
other UDMA66 drive has been rock solid on the BP6 for months:
	hda: SAMSUNG SV0432D, ATA DISK drive
Andre, un{less,til} we can work out what the problem is, can we add the IBM 
drives to the HPT366 udma4 blacklist? I'll also try it in udma3 mode to see 
what happens.
