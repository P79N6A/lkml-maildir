Indeed, Digital LCG used to publish our bug reports verbatim, including
patches if we supplied 'em, and thank us for the help.  (In fact, VMS
Engineering took heat for publishing "sanitized" reports instead of
photocopying the SPR forms as LCG had.)
MS' approach reminds me of what the fellow said about Lotho

	Seems he wanted to own everything himself, and then order folk
	about.
