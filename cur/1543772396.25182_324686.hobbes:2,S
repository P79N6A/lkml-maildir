one has to make sure the default debug options are disabled.  
(DEADLOCK_DETECT, PREEMPT_DEBUG, etc.) But even then there will be 
considerable overhead. Until recently, the overhead used to be even 
bigger. Note that hackbench is pretty much the worst-case for 
PREEMPT_RT: lots of locking and scheduling done and we compare the UP 
kernel to the SMP kernel in essence. (in fact PREEMPT_RT's locking is 
currently higher overhead than SMP)
