I have re-run the AIO tests on test9, test9-mm1, and
test9-mm1+retry-based-aio-dio-patch;
I ran the tests on an ext3 file system running on a 2-proc XEON 
to an ide disk drive.
2.6.0-test9:
===========
As reported earlier, test9 is seeing uninitialized data and the
kiocbs are being modified after free:
$ dio_sparse
non zero buffer at buf[0] => 0xaa,aa,aa,aa
non-zero read at offset 69533696
$ aiodio_sparse
non zero buffer at buf[0] => 0xaa,aa,aa,aa
non-zero read at offset 81854464
With slab debug on, test9 still gets
slab error in check_poison_obj(): cache `kiocb': object was modified after freeing
2.6.0-test9-mm1:
===============
dio_spares - run without seeing uninitialized data 
aiodio_sparse - get AIO errors and these kernel messages:
aio_run_iocb: iocb->ki_retry = NULL
Maximal retry count.  Bytes done 0
Slab corruption: start=e8676d68, expend=e8676e37, problemat=e8676d68
Last user: [<c018f883>](__aio_put_req+0xa8/0x1b3)
...
slab error in check_poison_obj(): cache `kiocb': object was modified after freeing
	
2.6.0-test9-mm1+retry-based-aio-dio-patch (from suparna)
=======================================================
dio_sparse - runs successfully and does not see uninitialized data
aiodio_sparse - runs successfully, does not see uninitialized data,
	and no slab corruption.
As before, my updated tests are here:
