I minimized my patch and against to 2.6.12-rc4 this time, see below.
The new schedstat fields are for the test propose only, so I removed
them completedly from patch. Theoritically, requeue_task() is always
cheaper than dequeue_task() followed by enqueue_task(). So, if 99% of
priority recalculation trigger requeue_task(), it will save.
In addition, my load is to build the kernel, which took around 30
minutes with around 30% CPU usage on 2x2 processors (duel processors
with HT enable).
Here is the statistics:
CPU0: priority_changed (669 times), priority_unchanged(335,138 times)
CPU1: priority_changed (784 times), priority_unchanged(342,419 times)
CPU2: priority_changed (782 times), priority_unchanged(283,494 times)
CPU3: priority_changed (872 times), priority_unchanged(365,865 times)
Thanks,
