The number of places expected to contain something sensible should I believe 
first be verified at 0x410 -- the equipment word. Bits 11-9 (0x0e00) should 
be the number of serial ports, 0 to 4 (so 5-7 is also a sanity check) and if 
BIOSes can be expected to zero out the non-used base-addresses (at 0x400, 
0x402, 0x404, 0x406) that's another sanity check. Don't know if they can 
though...
