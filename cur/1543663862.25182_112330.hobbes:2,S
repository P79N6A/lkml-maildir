This update is broken and strange in many ways, it would have been
nice if you actually sent this to some list for review before submitting..
(1) there's stuff like:
#if LINUX_VERSION_CODE >= KERNEL_VERSION(2,5,58)
#define mpt_inc_use_count()
#define mpt_dec_use_count()
#else
#define mpt_inc_use_count() MOD_INC_USE_COUNT
#define mpt_dec_use_count() MOD_DEC_USE_COUNT
#endif
but even if the old-style refcounting is deprecated now you can't
just simply remove it!  you need to rearchitecture your code to
work with try_module_get/module_put
(2) and like this:
+#if LINUX_VERSION_CODE < KERNEL_VERSION(2,5,59)
 MODULE_PARM(PortIo, "0-1i");
 MODULE_PARM_DESC(PortIo, "[0]=Use mmap, 1=Use port io");
+#endif
Again. just because old-style module paramters are deprecated you can't
just remove them without replacement, use module_param() instead.
(3) you remove backward copatiblity code in one place but add lots more
    in other places.  this doesn't make sense - either you have a nice or
    all releases driver, but not one that doesn't work everywhere _and_ looks
    horrible.
