  It should work on any kernel version,

Oops, thanks.  I've uploaded a version that fixes this.  I only found 
one instance of this, but it's pretty bad.

This was only in the emulation code.  I debated about this, but it's 
quite possible that doing the check will break the current users of this 
code.  I'm afraid if I add the checks it will cause other broken code to 
not work.  I could pull out the emulation code and supply it separately; 
I would probably choose to not put that part into the mainstream kernel, 
anyway.

Yes, you can have multiple IPMI interfaces on a host (I have a board 
that has 3!).  There are serial-port interfaces planned that could also 
easily have multiple instances as well as an on-board KCS.  If there's 
an easy way to do this with a minor device, I'm all ears, but I'd prefer 
to have a separate device for each interface.  This is one of the things 
I wanted discussion about.  Once that gets settled, I'll go to lanana. 
 Right now it's just being auto-assigned.

I know what you mean.
Thank you for your response and suggestions.
