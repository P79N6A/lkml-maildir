Hi,
I've discovered strange errors while booting my laptop (ASUS A7T) with 2.6.20 kernel. 
ACPI: Core revision 20060707
ACPI Error (psloop-0196): Found unknown opcode FD at AML address ffffc200000161d8 offset 5D44, ignoring [20060707]
ACPI Error (psloop-0196): Found unknown opcode FD at AML address ffffc2000001628d offset 5DF9, ignoring [20060707]

Is this related to buggy BIOS of my laptop?
Another strange think I can see is:
..MP-BIOS bug: 8254 timer not connected to IO-APIC
My machine is AMD Turion 64 X2 based laptop with NVidia chipset. I saw these error with older kernel too (2.6.19, 2.6.18).
