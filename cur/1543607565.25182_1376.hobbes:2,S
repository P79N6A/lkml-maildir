Subject: Getting idle linux parport to look like idle Win32 parallel port

I've got a device hooked up to the parallel port that seems to behave
differently when hooked up to an idle windows parallel port compared to
an idle linux parallel port.
What is the difference between the two? And is there any way to convince
parport to get the port to look the same? My guess is that some pin is
being held high/low by parport and that isn't being done by windows, or
vice versa.
