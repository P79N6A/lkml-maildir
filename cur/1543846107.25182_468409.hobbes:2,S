It's a kind of user-space driver :-D This part of the driver just send 
the data generated in the user-space program 1:1 to the controller. It 
works on 64-bit, but i doubt it works with 64-bit DMA addresses. This 
part of the code was copied from "drivers/scsi/dpt_i2o.c". I already 
tried to replace it with an IMHO nicer sysfs solution, but because this 
also required an "workaround" it was dropped again.
Best regards,
