Thanks for pointing out the idle cpu usage. I hadn't noticed it before.
I re-ran the tests with sched_granularity_ns 0, but fyi, I did try
that, as well as many
values around 5000000, 1-10ms, and some huge values too just to see
how the scheduler reacted. The reason why I settled on 2000000 was
because of trial and error and determining that value produced the
best fps.
Large values than 5000000 clearly caused the FPS to drop. Too small
values did the same.
FYI, when the desktop is sitting on only one cube side, i.e. normal
desktop. The idle usage for cfs and SD goes down to nearly 0.
But when the cube is in between faces in free form mode (the mouse
controls the cube in 3D space) the idle cpu usage goes up, for both
cfs, SD, and mainline.
I looked carefully at the idle usage values for cfs-v6 and sd-0.46, and
cfs hovers around ~35% idle cpu, sd hovers around ~3-30%, usually ~15% overall.
So perhaps my video card is fill rate limited during this stress
test... but... mplayer and totem are visibly refreshing faster with
sd-0.46, almost watchable and smooth during certain points in the
video. (clearly the fps for SD is much higher)
The new results:

Observation:
Music plays perfectly.
Audio of video's play perfectly.
Processes start faster than sched_granularity_ns 2000000
Browsing the web faster than 2000000, but still not as fast as
mainline (better than cfs)
Already open applications are responsive.
Behavior of video:
video's both moving forward. totem is doing ~0.5fps.
mplayer is doing ~2 fps.
Visibly slower refreshing vs sched_granularity_ns 2000000
For some reason top doesn't seem reliable considering the system was
stressed at the time?
