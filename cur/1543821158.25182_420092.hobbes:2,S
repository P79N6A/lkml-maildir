For me (bash) that doesn't do anything useful.
Were you looking for "echo -n 255 > brightness"?

Yes, but you do change the actual value, which IMHO you shouldn't when
it will return -EINVAL. I should have said
b) reject anything that isn't *only* a number and take no action
instead.

Yeah, unfortunately that is true. Maybe there should've been helper
functions like when you have a sysfs-int attribute that is set directly
without get/set calls. I'd suggest looking at that code.

I have a question about the backlight class: I'm writing a patch
currently to control the *keyboard* backlight on powerbooks, is that
appropriate for the backlight class (setting the fbdev callback to
reject everything)?
