Although this may be a mistake, LOOK VERY CAREFULLY at surrounding code
first.
Often there are structures not visible in the patch which are dependent
on the size and order of an array such as this one.
This patch may even be a bugfix...
In any case, IMNSHO (since I wrote the probe code here) what needs to
happen is that someone needs to go through Via and other drivers, and
use the new PCI matching code, and possibly the new
pci_register_driver() interface.
