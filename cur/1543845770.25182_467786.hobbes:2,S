x86 has it.  I figured its more important to not change x86 output than 
powerpc.

Yeah, its a bit of a toss-up.  powerpc wants to hide the warn flag 
somewhere, which either means having a different structure, or using the 
fields differently.  CONFIG_DEBUG_BUGVERBOSE supporters (ie, i386) want 
to make the structure completely empty in the !DEBUG_BUGVERBOSE case 
(which doesn't currently happen).

Thanks.  I'll try to fold all this together into a new patch when things 
settle down.
