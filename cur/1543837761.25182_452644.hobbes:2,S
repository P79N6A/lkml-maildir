Just to clarify, the current code (both ext3/4) already check the
filesystem blocks number before mounting it...it fails to mount the
large device if sector_t is 32bit:
in fs/ext4/super.c:
static int ext4_fill_super (struct super_block *sb, void *data, int
silent)
{
	.....
       if (EXT4_BLOCKS_COUNT(es) >
                    (sector_t)(~0ULL) >> (sb->s_blocksize_bits - 9)) {
                printk(KERN_ERR "EXT4-fs: filesystem on %s:"
                        " too large to mount safely\n", sb->s_id);
                if (sizeof(sector_t) < 8)
                        printk(KERN_WARNING "EXT4-fs: CONFIG_LBD not "
                                        "enabled\n");
                goto failed_mount;
        }
}
