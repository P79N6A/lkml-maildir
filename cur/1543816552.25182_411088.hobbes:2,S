In a lab I used to run we had a bunch of Linux workstations where  
some users tended to abuse the console beeper.  Our solution was a  
small kernel patch to add a CAP_VT_BEEP which was checked in the  
various console functions before generating a sound or modifying the  
default beep settings.  This allowed our automated hourly chimes to  
run without interference (run from cron as root), while preventing  
users not in the audio group from making sounds (/usr/bin/beep was  
root:audio 04750).
