This has been a long-standing problem with my system as well.  I
have an MS-5187 VIA MVP4 board and ST320413A UltraATA/100 drive.
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  4.40 seconds = 29.09 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in 13.06 seconds =  4.90 MB/sec

I remember trying out the drive on a Soltek 75KAV and got better
buffered disk results, ~25.0 MB/sec.
