Is this a concern on the client only?  I can run a test with just one client
and see if I can saturate the 100Mbit adapter.  If I can, would we need to
make any adjustments then?  FYI, at 115 MB/sec total throughput, that's only
2.875 MB/sec for each of the 40 clients.  For the TCP result of 181 MB/sec,
that's 4.525 MB/sec, IMO, both of which are comfortable throughputs for a
100Mbit client.
