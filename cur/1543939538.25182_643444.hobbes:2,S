-14 is EFAULT. This means that there was some access
to memory that was not mapped.
In the future, check /usr/include/asm/errno.h for exit
codes. Of course in user-space they are positive with
-1 being return from the function-call and errno being
set to this code. In the kernel, they are combined with
'error' being the negative of the return code.
