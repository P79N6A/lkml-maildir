I always like to follow up my own postings with a summary of the
results for future searches.
The VIA EPIA M10000 does not have a C3 processor on it so far
as release 2.4.20 of the kernel is concerned.  It has a C3-2
processor which apparently has a somewhat different instructions
set.  So use '-march=i686 -mmmx -msse' for gcc, and 
'Pentium II/Celeron' for the kernel.
