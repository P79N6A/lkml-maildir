No, it's exactly what you want.
What you do is that the _master_ thread starts out with just CLONE_PID,
but any subsequent thread uses CLONE_PID | CLONE_PARENT.
And no, obviously a pthreads application doesn't even realize anything
like this is going on. What the code would look like is something like
	int pthread_create()
	{
		static int has_done_this_before = 0;
		pid_t newtid;
		if (!has_done_this_before) {
			pid_t tid;
			has_done_this_before = 1;
			tid = clone(CLONE_PID);
			if (tid > 0) {
				/*
				 *  original thread becomes hidden master
				 * thread, and never returns
				 */
				i_am_the_master_thread();
				exit(0);
			}
			/*
			 * initial CLONE_PID thread comes here,
			 * it is now one of the "regular children".
			 */
		}
		newtid = clone(CLONE_PID | CLONE_PARENT);
		.. now we have the two "pthread" threads here ..
	}
See? (And no, the above is not the syntax for clone(), it's just meant to
kind of show what the intent is).
