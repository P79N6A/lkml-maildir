There is only one essential difference: the user can create nodes in configfs.  
Otherwise, the user does the same with both: display things and tweak things.  
The big difference is in your mind, not the user's mind.  And look above, 
you're saying "don't patch configfs, copy sysfs instead" and in the next 
breath you're saying "but oh they're completely different".

For example:

Yes, regrettable.  "Properties" would be tasteful and avoid the collision.

I haven't look at sysfs yet, but the backing store, which is just a tree of 
configfs_dirents that point at the corresponding dentries, is created on the 
fly.  Currently, directories are all pinned while only files are transient.  
There is no good reason for this as far as I can see, directories can be 
transient too.
What I did notice is that my fix for permissions is wrong.  I plugged the 
updated permissions back into the descriptor for all attributes of a config 
item - not what we want, the update needs to be restricted to just one 
attribute.  The right fix is to store the updated permissions in the 
configfs_dirent, which already has the field, it is just not used 
consistently.  See, the code is trying to say something to us, I think the 
message is "read me!"

It will not be hard to fix, the framework seems to be there already.  As far 
as complexity goes, it is trivial and the payoff is significant.  Cleaning up 
a bunch of little stylistic things will have a bigger effect on readability.
