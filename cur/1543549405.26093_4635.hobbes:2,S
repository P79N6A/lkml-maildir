Well looking at sr in test9-pre5 the only changes are the 
addition of 'static' before the sr_template definition 
and various functions. Sg already has the corresponding
functions declared static and the sg_template definition
has been changed to 'static'.
So as far as I can see the mid level has failed to call
sg_detect() when it should have. Simon has now confirmed
with a printk that sg_detect() was not called for the
scanner which the mid level obviously knows about.
