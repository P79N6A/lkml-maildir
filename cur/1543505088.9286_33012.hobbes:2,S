man -s perl chop, then put all perl manpages in /usr/man/manperl. this is
an entirely solvable problem using the existing man package.

texinfo is fine as long as you use tkinfo to view it, the default textual
browser is awful (really really really awful).
but the real problem, which inspired this highly offtopic thread, is that
the man pages are not being kept up to date with the info pages.
seeing as one of the stated goals/features of texinfo is an ability for a
texinfo file to generate both info and man pages, this is inexcusable.
perhaps this requires a patch to the man package so it generates an nroff
file from the texinfo source when necessary. then people can have texinfo
originals installed instead of nroff or info derivatives.
