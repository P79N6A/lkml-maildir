I'm learning to write driver for ethernet card. The
card only support memory address and has this PCI
configuration:
Offset
00     DeviceID   VendorID
04     PciStatus  PciCommand
08     ClassCode  RevisionId
0c     HeaderType LatencyTimer CacheLineSize
10     MemBaseAddr0
14     MemBaseAddr1 (for 64bit addressing)
18     IOBaseAddr0 (default disabled)
This is MemBaseAddr0 register:
                          3   2 1  0
-------------------------------------
Base Address                | 00 | 0 |
-------------------------------------
bit[0] = 0 means memory base addr
[2:1] support all 3 of memory map options
00 anywhere in 32 bit addr space
01 below 2 Meg
10 anywhere in 64 bit addr space
11 Reserved
I did this:
#if (LINUX_VERSION_CODE < 0x02030d)
  dev->base_addr = pdev->base_address[0];
#else
  dev->base_addr = pdev->resource[0].start;
#endif
myADpriv->Hwregs = (struct myHwregs
*)ioremap(dev->base_addr, 0x4000);
readl(&Hwregs->someReg);
when I try to read the hardware registers, I either
get 0 back or the machine stops working (but not hang,
I can telnet). Did I miss something/do something
wrong? what should I try differently?
Thanks.
