Actually, so would I.  I can suspect why there might exist machines like this 
(say the consistent attribute is settable at the pgd level)

Well, if it has to be done, it can be done by making alloc_consistent return a 
handle rather than an address and making wback/invalidate take the handle (but 
it's certainly not ideal).
