Subject: BUG: mkdir /mount-point fails wrongly in pre8

The latest (second?) pre8 kernel (at least, pre5 doesn't do it) fails
mkdir'ing a directory which is mount point, with ENOENT instead of
EEXIST, breaking at least CVS server for a funny reason, (in my case,
suitable directories for checking are /, /usr, /var, /home).
I suspect the culprit is the changes to fs/namei.c in the first pre8,
marked with the "ENOENT is definitely wrong" comment, missing the
properties of the mount points, but I currently have no time to chase
dentries :)
