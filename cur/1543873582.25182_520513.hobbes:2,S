Thoughts are in regrettably short supply at my end.
I do appreciate all the trouble you've taken to explain it,
in terms I'd understand.  And the way you've taken on board
my anxiety about vma assumptions diverging between NO/MMU.
But if "the SYSV SHM problem" you mention at the beginning
is just the "nattch" problem you mention at the end, I doubt
that's worth such a redesign as you're considering here.
Actually, I'm rather surprised SHM needs any such nattch count,
I'd expect it to deducible from file->f_count and mode&SHM_DEST
(but haven't investigated whether that really works out at all).
If you just need a little CONFIG_MMU in ipc/shm.c to solve your
problem, I don't think more is justified.
Your struct vm_region idea does look more to my taste than what
you presently have; yet if you pursue it, I think it would just
make divergence worse wouldn't it?  NOMMU wanting vma to contain
a pointer to vm_region, MMU wanting vm_region embedded in vma.
I don't really understand why NOMMU chooses to share vmas, or
vm_regions, rather than just sharing the data which they indicate.
Just because you can use less memory that way?  But no need to
justify it now, I'm unlikely to study it in detail.
