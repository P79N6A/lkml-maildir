I've read the archive of lhms-devel.
You're going to take in most of the original migration code
except for some tricks to migrate pages which are hard to move.
I think this is what you said the complexity, which you
want to remove forever.
I have to explain that this complexity came from making the code
guarantee to be able to migrate any pages. So the code is designed:
  - to migrate heavily accessed pages.
  - to migrate pages without backing-store.
  - to migrate pages without I/O's.
  - to migrate pages of which status may be changed during the migration
    correctly.
This have to be implemented if the hotplug memory use it.
It seems to become a reinvention of the wheel to me.
It's easy to add a new interface to the code for memory policy aware
migration. It will be wonderful doing process migration prior to
planed hotremove momory. This decision should be done out of kernel.
Thanks,
Hirokazu Takahashi.
