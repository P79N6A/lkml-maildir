Hi,
I tried plain 2.2.16, 2.2.16-mm-fix-4, 2.2.17pre , all give the same
behaviour :
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:        193304     189248       4056      46724      74808      74612
-/+ buffers/cache:      39828     153476
Swap:       136544       4580     131964
This is on a 64 MEG machine, that has twice as much things running :
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:         63556      61524       2032       4280       1332      45300
-/+ buffers/cache:      14892      48664
Swap:       128516       7296     121220
Two thing I see : Large buffer and shared numbers.
Can someone enlighten me on why these are so high ?? Sounds like something
got very broken in 2.2.16...
	Regards,
		Igmar
