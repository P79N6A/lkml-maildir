It would be better to change SI_SIGIO in all the 
include/asm-*/siginfo.h files from -5 to __SI_CODE(__SI_SIGIO, -5)
__SI_SIGIO would become (6 << 16).
The code in arch/*/kernel/signal.c only copies the lower 16 bits to user 
space. This means that the test SI_FROMKERNEL returns true and user space 
still gets the same values as before.
The same trick is indeed used also in my POSIX timer patch.
