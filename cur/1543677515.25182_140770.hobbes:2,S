Ok, I'm confused.  I suspect that it may be something to do with two
PCI device structures appearing for the same device, however I don't
see that happening with the code which is in 2.5.7x.
Which kernel version first showed the problem?
Which modules are you loading?
Which version of cardmgr are you using?
Are you using any modules from the pcmcia-cs package?
