heh.
I've confirmed that 2.6.22-rc6+thatpatch fails, but 2.6.22-rc6 plus the
three hundred patches up to and including that patch doesn't fail.
So there's something between "origin.patch" and
"clockevents-fix-resume-logic.patch" in the 2.6.22-rc6-mm1 lineup which
fixes thatpatch, once it is applied.
So I'm doing an inverted reverse polish bisection search to find out which
patch preemptively fixes clockevents-fix-resume-logic.patch.  Try doing
that with git, suckers.
gimme twenty minutes...
