I submitted a patch to James, which he already applied to his tree, that
addresses this problem.  It conglomerates the series of bitmaps into 1,
so only one fb_imageblit is necessary.  It should give faster painting
than the original 2.5.x code, hopefully faster than 2.4.x code, but
slower than 8x16 painting because of the additional packing.

Yes, all drivers should treat the pseudo_palette as u32* anyway, so why
not change pseudo-palette from void* to u32*?

I also agree for a different reason.  Cards with unconventional formats
(such as monochrome at 8 bpp - 0 for black , 0xff for white) will not
work with the current code.
