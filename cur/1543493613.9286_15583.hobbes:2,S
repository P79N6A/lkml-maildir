Assuming that kernel sources are properly installed in /usr/src/linux
from a clean tarball, and are unmodified, what is the easiest way to
grab the kernel version number of the installed source?
I've been trying to grab it from the top level makefile, but my script
writing abilities seem to be lacking.
Anyone have a few lines of simple bash code to get the kernel source
version?
