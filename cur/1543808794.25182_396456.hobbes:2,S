NACK
This adds an artificial offset to the expiry time, for what reason? The
expiry code makes sure that timers can not expire early. See:
	timer = rb_entry(node, struct hrtimer, node);
	if (now.tv64 <= timer->expires.tv64)
		break;
in kernel/hrtimers.c:run_hrtimer_queue(), where now is already tick
aligned.
Please provide a testcase (or detailed use-case) which proves that this
is necessary.
