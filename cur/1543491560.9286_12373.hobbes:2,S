I'm working on a little ditty to spit out information about an ELF file and have
run into a problem.  In decoding the section header for the section that holds 
the linking information I find that entries in this section are 10 bytes in
size, looking in the ELF docs I have I see that the size is really 16 bytes.
I think what I have done so far works ok, I've gotten the header, section headers, and string table to decode with values that look correct, until now I guess.
Does anyone know of a program that works kindof like this that I could use
to check my values.
Thank.
