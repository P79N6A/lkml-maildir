Very well, let's do it, then.

Yes, that's my point.  Blinking is too common, it needs to be generic (and I
don't care if it is done through triggers, as long as it is generic *and*
hardware-implementation-friendly, I will use it).

If you have a 2.6.20 backport of the new LED class, I could work on it when
I finish the ibm-acpi conversion to sysfs, which should take about one more
week.

Agreed.
BTW: I need to have two leds that are the same device, different colors.
The code already handles this just fine (it is NOT a multicolor led), I'd
like to know how should I name the parameter?
power:green and power:yellow?
That should be done in a standard way as well.

Add the following functionality, and I think I would be happy with the
interface:
1. A way for the driver to say "led access is expensive, do not enable
software blink emulation"  (maybe you already have this...)
2. A way for userspace to either know which ranges are hardware-emulated, or
to request that only hardware emulation be used.
I can live with just (1), but I think (2) would make the interface more
complete.  Keep in mind that whatever can be hardware-emulated is probably
the default way to use that led, so it is an interesting data-point for
userspace.
