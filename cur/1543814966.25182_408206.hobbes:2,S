Subject: [PATCH 1/12] [MIPS] Improve description of VR41xx based machines
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/3/19/136

MIPS supports various NEC VR41XX chips and not just the VR4100.
Update Kconfig accordingly, thereby bringing the file in sync with
the linux-mips tree.
