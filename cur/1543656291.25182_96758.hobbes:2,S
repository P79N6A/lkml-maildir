I was just looking at doing that.
I'd suggest including CONFIG_CRYPTO_TEST in the default size
determination, and allowing both smaller sizes (for low ram
applications, such as embedded systems) and larger ones.
With all of the crypto =y, the test wipes everything before ACPI out
of the buffer before syslogd gets to start and log the buffer to disk.
Even with a 64k buffer.
