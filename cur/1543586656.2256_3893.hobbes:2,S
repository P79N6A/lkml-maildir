Right. So if we go to 64 bits NOW (in 2.4), then when after 3.2 we
actually start needing > 16 bits of dev_t everyone can downgrade to
2.0, except those people who use drivers that require those extra
bits.
The further away from "the deadline" that we switch, the easier it
becomes to provide a smooth upgrade path. When we have 65536 devices
in use, when we finally switch, you can bet your ass we'll be using
the "new" device number space right away. However, if we're still
comfortable with the 16 bits, we can upgrade the infrastructure ASAP,
and make the "no return" switch later. Much later.
