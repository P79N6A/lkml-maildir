David, I don't know what program you're running, but it is NOT cdrecord! 
There is no such file used in the program, and hasn't been in versions 
going back at least a year. I don't recall there ever being such a 
thing, and I've been using it since cdwrite was active. Any program 
which uses that file has NO relation to Joerg's man page, it's not his code.
