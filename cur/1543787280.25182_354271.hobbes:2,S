Adaptec is unfortunately a special case.  QLogic and other enterprise 
vendors get along with quite well on $100k machines.
Both Luben and his predecessor, Justin Gibbs, were severely dissatisfied 
with the SCSI core.  Often they have raised valid issues that need 
addressing, but their choice has been to work around or ignore existing 
code (and maintainers), rather than work with it, and fix it.

Hardly.  SAS support is coming, whether from Adaptec or someone else.

The current maintainers seem to agree on the path to transport independence.

Yes, let's not argue this silliness.  Other vendors don't seem to have 
this level of problem.

Sigh.  This is not about pride.  There's already a path to fixing up the 
SCSI core to work nicely with SAS (and nicer with FC/iSCSI).  Changing 
to a new path midstream, in the middle of addressing the stated 
problems, causes more delay, more harm than good.
