I have now converted the timeout-based set mtuliplexing to use hrtimer instead.
The patch is available from the perfmon2 GIT tree on kernel.org.
with this patch, multiplexing works with tickless kernels for system-wide
sessions. All the arch specific hooks are gone.
For system-wide, the timeout is measurement wall-clock time. For per-thread,
it is measuring virtual time. I could not find a way to count virtual time
with hrtimer. Thus I ended up using a hrtimer/cpu and cancel/restore timeout
on context switch. I suspect there may be a better way of doing this but for
now it seems to work.
With this patch, timeout-bsed multiplexing should work on all arch. I have
test on i386. x86-64, ia64. Please try the other ones as well.
Couple of interfaces changes related to this patch:
  - switch timeout is only running between pfm_start/pfm_stop calls and when the
    context is not masked due to sampling overflows. It used to be running between
    pfm_load_contex/pfm_unload_context. This means that on architectures which allow
    start/stop for user level (e.g., IA-64), it is now necessary to call pfm_start and
    pfm_stop when using multiple sets. It is not really practical to combine set
    switching in the kernel with user level direct reading of the registers.
  - pfm_create_evtsets() fails if the timeout is not a multiple of the clock resolution.
    Using clock_getres(CLOCK_MONOTONIC) users can figure out the granularity and adjust
    the timeout accordingly.
