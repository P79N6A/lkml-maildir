As for the missing print.  Did you have an appropriate earlyprintk?

4MB is a little harsh, but I haven't worked through what the exact rules
are, I know 4MB is the worst case alignment for arch/i386.
The rule is that we have to be at the same offset from 4MB as we
were built to run at.  So in this case address where (address %4MB) == 1MB.
We might be able to get away with 2MB alignment.  I thought kexec-tools
did that calculation automatically for an ET_DYN image but it has been
a while since I looked.
My goal with the check was to catch problems early before something
bad happened.
