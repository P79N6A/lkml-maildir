* It might uncover subtle bugs that would otherwise not occur.
* Compiling with unusual options means that less people will know about
any problems it causes you.

The kernel does not use glibc functions, so you can compile the kernel
and glibc with different compilers.
Bug reports about GCC 3.2.x compiled kernels will probably be welcomed
by most developers.
