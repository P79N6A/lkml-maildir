As far as I am concerned this doesnt matter so much.
This is very trivial work, and only little time is wasted
in case of duplication. It is unavoidable.
(For example, looking at the detect functions of scsi drivers
I happened to come across pas16.c and did a largish cleanup.
Hesitate a bit submitting the results, since the driver showed
some signs of bitrot - maybe nobody has used it for years -
if someone uses pas16, please tell me - let me cc linux-scsi -
but today you submit a little patch on pas16.)
