See it. The scenario im thinking about is:
CPU1                                CPU2
pick page from lru
Lock it
get_page
try_to_release_buffers fails
UnlockPage
/* Window here */
                                     Pick page form lru
				     page_cache_get
				     Lock it 
				     actually free the buffers
				     UnlockPage
				     page_cache_release
					doesn't remove the page from
					the lru because CPU 1 holds
					a reference
put_page dropps last reference
but doenn't remove the page from
the lru because it is put_page
and not page_cache release.
---> Page gets freed while it is still on the lru. If the lru cache
     holds a reference that's a non issue.
CPU1 is the path in shrink_cache.
I admit that I don't have a real path that does what CPU2 does in
this scenario but doing what CPU2 does should be perfectly legal.

Well yes ;-) There's funny things going on like accessing a page
after page_cache_release...
