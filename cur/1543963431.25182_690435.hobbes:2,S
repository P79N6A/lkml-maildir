Then scrap the part about it possibly fixing a regression and the

It is important that our metadata is as complete and correct as 
reasonably possible. Our code is not as well documented as it should be, 
and in my experience often the only way to understand what happens and 
why it happens is to ask git for the metadata (and I'm actually doing 
this even for most of my "trivial" patches).
In 3 hours or 3 years someone might look at this commit trying to 
understand what it does and why it does this.
And there's a big difference between "we do it because it's correct from 
a theoretical point of view" and "it is supposed to fix a huge 
performance regression".
