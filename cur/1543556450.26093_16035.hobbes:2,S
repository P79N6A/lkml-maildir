Hello
 Thanks for your reply. But this can create problems
in some of the cases. For example, "scp" over TCP
starts with TOS 0, then goes to 8 (bulk data). What
happens is that when RTOs are cached, they are
updated for TOS 8 and not for TOS 0, therefore a
new connection does not pick up the cached RTO.
Does this make sense ?
Thanks,
