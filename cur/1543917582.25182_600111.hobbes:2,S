Some good news from here. :-)
WIth the patch below applied 2.6.23-rc8-mm2 works fine on the nx6325 _with_ NO_HZ
and HIGH_RES_TIMERS set.  Suspend and hibernation work as well, happy me.
NO_HZ and HIGH_RES_TIMERS also work on this box with the hrt patch plus the
C1E-related fix on top of 2.6.23-rc8.
Does it make sense to test CPU_IDLE too at this point?
