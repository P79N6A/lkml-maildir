Hello,
With the attached .config, the kernel reliably panics when someone
issues a 'sync' (or the kernel decides to write back its buffers):
reiser4 panicked cowardly: reiser4[sync(8465)]: commit_current_atom (fs/reiser4/txnmgr.c:1062)[zam-597]:
Kernel panic - not syncing: reiser4[sync(8465)]: commit_current_atom (fs/reiser4/txnmgr.c:1062)[zam-597]:
(this is all that is printed)
This happens only with Reiser4 and libata ata_piix driver; it does not
happen with Reiser4 and 'old' IDE piix driver. Other fs are also not
affected. I have no idea how to track this, I hope someone else does :)
Hardware is a pentium-m laptop with ICH4 pata.
