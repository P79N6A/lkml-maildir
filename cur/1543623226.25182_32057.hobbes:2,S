Neat.  I made something similar last night but messed it up originally
so never sent it.

We have a problem if off + count >= 2^32 here.
Ideally i think we need to check for 32-bit (31-bit?) overflow here
and return -EOVERFLOW.  I made a similar patch last night for
sendfile64 which included this check (although I was tired and the
patch was slightly wrong).  Actually, I think wew are missing
EOVERFLOW checks in a number of paths, ideally I'd like to make one
function to check and have all other functions reference that if
people agree that makes sense.
    +	}
    +	ret = common_sendfile(out_fd, in_fd, ppos, count);
    +	if (offset)
    +		put_user((off_t)pos, offset);
    +	return ret;
What is another thread unmapped 'offset' during the system call?  Do
we want to check the result of put_user here and return -EFAULT?
(If so, there are other system calls to consider such as select).
