Looks good, some nits below.

Single / Double Address Cycle. DAC is used with 32-bit PCI to push a
64-bit address in two cycles.

I would rephrase as follows: "Support for software bounce buffers used
on x86-64 systems which don't have a hardware IOMMU. Using this PCI
devices which can only access 32-bits of memory can be used on systems
with more than 3 GB of memory".

Due to historical precedence, some of these options are only valid for
GART. Perhaps mention for each option which IOMMUs it is valid for or
split them on a per IOMMU basis?
This one (size) is gart only.

The rest looks good. Please resend and I'll add my Acked-by.
