It means that the data returned is not the same as the data sent. This
should never happen.
The question is: where does this corruption occur.
I was going to ask you to ping the host just beyond your Linux
machine, but if I'm not mistaken, you're already doing that. Right?
If you could dump the packets on your local ethernet to/from the windows
box:
	tcpdump -i eth0 host <IP of Windows machine>
then that might help in giving the networking guys a clue....
