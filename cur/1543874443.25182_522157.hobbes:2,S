Ok, and I do think per process VMAs are the way to go if you are
going to stay anywhere close to the rest of linux.

I don't quite what your limitations are but it is a fundamental
assumption that the sharing happen in the page cache.  I.e. The pages
that are in the page cache are the only ones that can be effectively
shared.
As a corollary if a page is not in the page cache it should not be
shared.  I guess this limits sharing to just those things in ramfs?
You obviously don't have the hardware to enforce this but at least
you can define the sharing of anything else as undefined.
Now I don't know what it takes from your data structures to achieve
sharing of page cache pages.  Or what your underlying complications
are.  Not having the page cache as the fundamental underlying sharing
pool is strongly non-intuitive from the perspective of the rest
of linux.

Sure.  But this is sharing with the kernel as well.  And you always
have at least one kernel and one application.  So if they can share
the file buffers that is a win.  And what mmap of any file backed
pages is expected to provide.

Scratch the fork part.  You still aren't calling the open/close
methods when they would normally be called, and that is where your
problem lies.

Exactly.
