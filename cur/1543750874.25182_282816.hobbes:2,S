wrt. necessity, it's quite handy: check out the 2.6.10 changelog, almost
all preemption bugs wrt. smp_processor_id() were found this way.
what precisely is the 'mess' you are referring to?
is it the way the include file falls back to the original
smp_processor_id() definition if an arch doesnt define
__smp_processor_id()? I could get rid of that and just require every
arch to define __smp_processor_id().
or is it the addition of _smp_processor_id() as a way to signal 'this
smp_processor_id() call in a preemptible region is fine, trust me'? We
could do smp_processor_id_preempt() or some other name - any better
suggestions?
