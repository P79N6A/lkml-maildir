I would like to see an option that does the folowing:
1) Let "normal user" programs bind to ports < 1024 
 ONLY IF
2) that program was given this "capability" by root, for example
   by means of an file-system flag.
This allows a lot of, currently, SUID-programs to run as non-root all the
way, and thus, when used properly, enhances security of networked systems.
