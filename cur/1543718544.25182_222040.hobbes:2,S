Usually not a lot of barriers would be generated. If you use reiser and
heavy fsync load, it should be pretty apparent of barriers are issued or
not (ie compare without barrier + wb cache, with barrier + wb cache, and
with/without - wb cache).

A quick hack would be to replace 'err' with '1' in this line in
drivers/ide/ide-io.c:void ide_end_drive_cmd():
        if (blk_barrier_preflush(rq) || blk_barrier_postflush(rq))
                ide_complete_barrier(drive, rq, err);
that'll fail the first barrier, should trigger the fall back. Or just
try -o barrier=flush on a SCSI drive, should fail the barrier too.

IDE will not tell you, the file system should flag the disabling of
barriers (like reiser currently does). Try SCSI case again.
