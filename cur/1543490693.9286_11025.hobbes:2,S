What's right with it?
1. Getting everyone to do that on their Linux system is no easier than
getting them to make a /interpreters and putting symbolic links to perl
and other interpreters there.
2. Getting everyone to replace their *BSD, Solaris, SCO, HP-UX, etc. systems
with Linux so they can do that is almost certainly harder than getting them
to make a /interpreters and put symbolic links in.
