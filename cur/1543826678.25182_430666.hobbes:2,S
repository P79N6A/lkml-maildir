Vetoed!
The current code gets it quite right: if someone calls open(O_TRUNC),
then may_open() calls do_truncate() with the ATTR_MTIME|ATTR_CTIME flags
set. That will cause the client to do the right thing _regardless_ of
the size optimisation.

Also wrong.
This change causes the server to do entirely the wrong thing for
truncate()/ftruncate() calls: in the SuSv3 spec, a call that fails to
change the file length is supposed to leave the file entirely unchanged:
that includes mtime/ctime as well as suid/sgid bits.
