Wrong.  If what you say happens, then the compiler is broken.  The value
of an assignment expression is the value of the left hand part AFTER the
assingment.  So,
if(a=b)
is EXACTLY the same as
a=b;
if(a)

If your compiler always evaluates the assignment in "if(a=b)" to true,
then your compiler is broken according the C standard.  That and/or your
lint is broken WRT the C standard.
You keep talking about boolean in C.  There is no such thing in the
language.  In C, the result of the expression (which must be of pointer
or arithmatic type) in the if is compared to 0.

Ahh, the good old "quit while your behind" method.  Don't go away mad,
Dick, just go away.
