Thanks for the patch!!!
I finally got time to apply it this weekend, and plugged my FlashPoint
back in, and it seems to be working like a charm.  I should check for
the reset messages to see if it's having to do this stuff, but I
suspect that it is, because without the patch, I usually couldn't even
get the system to *BOOT* with the FlashPoint installed.
Just my $.02 worth...
