Ingo, what's the status of putting irq 0 back in a thread with
PREEMPT_RT?  IIRC this had some adverse (maybe unfixable?) effects so it
was disabled a few months ago.
I don't think there's much point in comparing i-pipe to PREEMPT_RT if we
know that 21usec pipeline effect from the timer IRQ (see list archives)
is still there.
