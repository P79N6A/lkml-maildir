Then it would be inconsistent with ppc64 where it does exist, and ppc64
has the very same problem.
So the solution would be to patch also the ppc64 [GS]ETREGS breaking
compatibility with existing applications. 
The MULTI proposal was a way to have a fast, simple, safe support.
Fast: one syscall does all
simple: it is a vector of calls with the params of std ptrace calls
safe: if is not a new call, the security checks for ptrace are already
in place
flexible: with [GS]ETREGS you can get only the registers you need
instead of all the registers (this is just an example).
PPC wants to read/write 32 registers, i386 17, x86_64 21 etc,
when maybe just some of the registers are meaningful to your
application. Using [GS]ETREGS, you have to save the entire register set
somewhere to restore them after some changes. This applies also to areas
of memory, and other ptrace commands.
backward compatible: if you did not use it, nothing changes in ptrace
support.
If you do not find this proposal interesting, I'll continue to support
it as a specific patch for umview. I am not here to "sell" any solution.
On the contrary I think it might be useful in many applications.
