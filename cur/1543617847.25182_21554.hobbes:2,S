   Under Linux, PCI consistent allocation support is a requirement. Let me
   cross fingers for this to stay as it is. :)
It is my intention to keep it like this.  I have shown 3 or 4 ports,
after I've been told "we cannot do consistent memory on our platform",
that in fact they could :-)
For this reason, someone will have to do the equivalent of parting the
seas to convince me to change things :-)
