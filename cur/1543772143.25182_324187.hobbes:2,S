Well not exactly.  The video device may have already been disabled, so
the user wouldn't see it anyway.  The reason I don't like BUG() here is
that it's very unlikely passing an invalid PMSG will have serious
consequences.  The problems are likely less significant than those
caused by calling BUG().  Many suspend routines don't set power at all
yet (e.g. cardbus) and it still works out fine.  Defaulting to the
current state seems like a very safe behavior.  Then, after resume, we
can see the messages.  I'd like to see PM just work, and we have to be
careful during an API change.

Yeah, I wasn't sure where those flags were coming from...

What do you have in mind for adding to the structure in the future?
