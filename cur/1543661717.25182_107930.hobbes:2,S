	I'd be interested in some elaboration on these two points.
	I'd like to understand what problems were solved for other
architectures by putting the module loader into the kernel, so I could
compare what would be involved to delivering the same benefit with a
user-level module loader.
	I think the MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE stuff is largely independent
of whether the module loading is done inside the kernel or from user
level, but if this is due to some misunderstanding on my part, please
set me straight.
	Although I write this in response to a message by Greg KH, I
would welcome answers from anyone.
