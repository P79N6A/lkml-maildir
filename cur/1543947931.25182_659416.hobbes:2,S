OK, if you want I'll send it.

But that way it's no longer clear which symbols apply to which
registers.  It's not "needed" because that information became
harder to find ... as in <include/asm-avr32/arch-at32ap/time.h>,
which ISTR isn't even complete in its bitfield definitions.

There's one clear need for tclib:  to hand out timers from the (small)
pool of hardware entities.  Each one can be used for different purposes
by different drivers.
The *current* tclib addresses only that minimal need.
You're the one who wants to add more to it; I was just pointing out that
you were being inconsistent.

You're being inconsistent here.  It has to make the same kinds of
decision about which clocks to enable/disable.  So why should it
have to platform_get_irq() but not clk_get()?

No; it doesn't need references to clocks for unused TC channels.

True about doing the ioremap.
