Either the in-tree JSM driver or the out-of-tree DGNC driver will work
fine.
The out-of-tree DGNC driver was the intended driver to be used with
the all the various Digi Neo boards.
The JSM driver was intended to be used with only the 2 port Digi Neo
board,
however, I am not aware of any reason why the 8 port wouldn't work as
well.
If you use the JSM driver, you will need to update the PCI id table
in the JSM driver to add in the 8 port PCI ID.
