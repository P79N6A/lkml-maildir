Going over old ground again, any administrator a) compiling the kernel as root 
or b) relying on GNU tar to make _security policy decisions_ is completely 
insane.
The only "trick" here is tar's decision to not apply umask, or root uid/gid, 
to files in a tar when extracted as root. This might make sense for tars that 
you created and want to extract again (say restoring a backup), but it 
certainly NEVER makes sense for files downloaded off the Internet.
If people are insistent that they must extract and compile things as root, at 
the very least you should have the following in root's ~/.bashrc:
alias tar='tar --no-same-permissions --no-same-owner '
Then if you want the default (imo flawed) tar behaviour, you can just call tar 
directly.
Really, people that complain about security should have a modicum of a clue; 
allowing a tar file that _somebody else_ applied _their_ security policy, to 
define yours, is a deeply flawed concept. umask is there for a reason.
