Let me add some more
	sys_setuid/gid/etc need to be synchronous only and not occur
while other async syscalls are running in parallel to meet current kernel
assumptions.
	sys_exec and other security boundaries must be synchronous only
and not allow async "spill over" (consider setuid async binary patching)

What are the semantics of async sys_async_wait and async sys_async ?
