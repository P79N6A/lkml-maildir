Look at and understand DefineCacheLookup (in
include/linux/sunrpc/cache.h).
Then look for places that it is used.
But if you find you cannot stomach that, but assured that you aren't
alone and have a look in something newer than 2.6.16.  There-in, and
Randy has suggest, it will be easy to find the definition.
