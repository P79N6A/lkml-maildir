I don't have much experience of half duplex protocols outside of the
amateur radio world, but there are certain hooks that appear to be
obvious starting points, as follows:
 1. Use of a half duplex protocol implies that the serial port
    has a flag indicating its state, with four valid states, as
    follows:
     a. RECEIVING    - This port is currently receiving data, so
                       anything to transmit is just queued until
                       reception finishes.
     b. RX-TO-TX     - This port is in the process of switching
                       from reception to transmission of data.
                       This would only occur when the receiver
                       has been idle for a predefined length of
                       time AND the transmit buffer is not empty.
     c. TRANSMITTING - This port is currently transmitting data,
                       so is not able to receive anything.
     d. TX-TO-RX     - This port is in the process of switching
                       from transmission to reception of data.
 2. Half duplex protocols are generally receiver driven, with
    a station wishing to transmit waiting for a clear channel.
    This suggests the first two hooks:
     a. A routine to be called to say "The receiver has not
        received any data for X units of time, and there is
        data waiting in the transmit buffer", with X being
        an attribute of the serial line, similar to those
        that already exist (such as close_delay). This would
        move the line into RX-TO-TX mode.
     b. A routine to be called to say "The transmitter has
        run out of data to transmit" which would move the
        line into TX-TO-RX mode.

I'd certainly agree here.

True...
