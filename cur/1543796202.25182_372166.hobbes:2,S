Well, I haven't brought it up, I'm trying to get rid od it.

These plugins can do no magic, if the hardware timer is slow, the whole 
thing gets slow.

That one is not really an issue in the kernel, unless you want an uptime

I'm not against HR timer, I have a problem with using them as timer for 
everything.

The point is still valid, short interval timer are cheaper using normal 
timer, independent of whether they are removed or they expire.
