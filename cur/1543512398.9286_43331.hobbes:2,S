Right. But if I do that, it is because I want to _create_ the devices
(nothing to loose there).

ext2 does that for free.

Please explain. How is lo, eth0 and sl0 too dynamic to handle via
major/minor?
Truth is, networking is designed the way it is not because of the
_devices_, but because of the volatility and sheer number of _network
peers_ (both current and potential). Now this might make a good model for
the mythological machine with hundreds of devices coming and going that is
talked so much about here. But there you see that you address a _service_
(device type?) through an _address_ (IP address, for human consumption a
domain name; with a naming service in between) that is unique on the world
(device serial, MAC address, IPv6?). But in the end all this is machinery
that gives a convenient handle that takes you to the _content_ (today's
favorite cartoon). That last is your objective. Don't get hung up on
mechanisms, look for the final end and design a better way to get there.

I don't understand this at all.

Does hda5 appear again? Do the permissions on fd0 stay? Even if I unplug
the system after the calls return? If the system is hopelessly overloaded,
no way to run any daemons at all? If all filessytems are full?

First is obvious. Second one, as permissions on files usually _can_ be
changed by admins, you very rarely will see this. But you very often see
systems broken (into) because some permission wasn't set up right. Don't
make it even harder.

Why? The module will get loaded iff the card is there, and the device will
react as it should. If you plug in various stuff, you need more care, sure.

Said miscreant could also screw up your /etc/devices.perm file, or "fix"
the kernel so it gives the wrong permissions (and even lies about them).
Might be marginally easier to do via devfs, BTW.
In the current scheme, boot singleuser and rerun /dev/MAKEDEV (or a clean
copy off distribution media).
No advantages either way.
