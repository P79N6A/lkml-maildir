Exactly the same for me since I was that poster :)
And interactivity performance of 2.2.7 seems much weaker than 2.2.6's.
I mailed an interesting alt-sysreq-m ouput to the list as well and I can
understand there's some problem at network buffer code of 2.2.7.
I downloaded a big file and then I exit from netscape, X etc, etc,
but the sysreq combo showd me 40Mb used memory for network buffers.
And I COULD NOT free that memory amount without rebooting.
Then I switched back to 2.2.6. And no more mp3 clicking, no more cannot
allocate memory at opening /dev/dsp, and no more 40Mb network buffers.
I used the same configuration options and the same alsa driver with
both of the kernels I mentioned here. (Only one differnce : with 2.2.7
I configured it for large TCP window which was not set for me with my
2.2.6.)
