Hmmm... In most of the callsites we hold a writelock on mmap_sem right?

Passing mm is fine as long as mmap_sem is held.

Hmmm... this is ptep_clear_flush? What about the other uses of 
flush_tlb_page in asm-generic/pgtable.h and related uses in arch code?
(would help if your patches would mention the function name in the diff 
headers)

Does this have to be inline? ptep_clear_flush will become quite big
