Hi Russell,
The get_user_pages() vs dcache coherency issue still seems to be
unresolved on ARM.
See flush_anon_page() and flush_kernel_dcache_page() in
Documentation/cachetlb.txt and their implementation on PARISC.
Can you please take a look at this?
Thanks,
Miklos

So 2.6.18 does NOT work on the ARM using the fuse.ko that gets built from the
kernel sources.
If I add the flush_cache_all() patch or the DCAHCE_BUG patch, then
everything works fine.
This was tested on my gumstix, which is an ARM XScale PXA255 running
in little-endian mode, using 2.6.18. I was using the hello filesystem
for the tests.
