Hi,
I have some machines that I need to be able to power down via
APM. Somhow, I can't get this to work: "halt -p" or "poweroff"
will halt the system, but without turning off the power.
I tried sysvinit-2.75 and sysvinit-2.76 on different kernels
(2.2.9 - 2.2.13). Yes, in the machine's bios setup, APM is
enabled, the kernels are compiled with CONFIG_APM=y and
CONFIG_APM_POWER_OFF=y. MS Windows 98 is able to turn off the
power on these machines, so it must be possible...
On my home machine, which has the same motherboard in it
(ASUS-P2B), poweroff works. The only possibly relevant piece of
software that is different on this machine is the C library:
glibc 2.1 on my home machine, glibc 2.0 otherwise. Could this
have any impact? If yes - is there any workaround with glibc 2.0?
Miquel van Smoorenburg, the author of sysvinit, whom I had asked
first, assured me that this was solely a kernel issue - maybe
sombody on this list has any idea? Any hint would be greatly
appreciated!
Regards,
            Peter
