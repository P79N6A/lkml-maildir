Subject: different behavior with 3c59x module vs built-in

I have a dell laptop and am useing a 3com cardbus nic in it.
currently running 2.4.13 (but I don't remember seeing driver updates since
then for this driver)
If I compile the 3c59x driver into the kernel the nic does not work.
If I compile the driver as a module and load it manually the nic does work
it doesn't matter if I load the card first or insert the nic first, in
both cases the module needs to be loaded manually (even though the kernel
autoloader is enabled).
I'm on a relativly slow line until monday.
let me know if there is anything anyone wants me to try.
