Trivial marketing issue then.

Do you really think that your customers/potential customers are that 
stupid?  Is your marketing department so inept that they cannot compete 
with something which by your own words is not even _close_ to being 
equivalent?  Remember, you have repeatedly touted the man-years of effort 
involved in replication of BK functionality.
You are (sadly) making a complete _ass_ of yourself.  If someone comes up 
with a functional clone of BK, that's tough shit.  You don't have to help 
them, and you are free to hinder them in any way law permits.
In closing, I must say that you aren't the only one pissing me the fsck 
off.  I'm sick and tired of the entire thread[s].  As long as I can get at 
the source, I couldn't give a fsck less what Linus or anybody else likes to 
use.  As long as tarballs exist and as long as patches hit this list, I'm a 
happy camper.
Bah humbug, color me disappointed.  I guess I need to start filtering my mail.
