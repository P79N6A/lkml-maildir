Solving this sort of issue was one of the reasons for the smpnice patches.

Depends how keen you are on fairness.  Unless the process are long term 
continuously active tasks that never sleep it's probably not an issue as 
they'll probably move around enough in the long term for them each to 
get 66% over the long term.
Exact load balancing for real work loads (where tasks are coming and 
going, sleeping and waking semi randomly and over relatively brief 
periods) is probably unattainable because by the time you've work out 
the ideal placement of the currently runnable tasks on the available 
CPUs it's all changed and the solution is invalid.  The best you can 
hope for that change isn't so great as to completely invalidate the 
solution and the changes you make as a result are an improvement on the 
current allocation of processes to CPUs.
The above probably doesn't hold for some systems such as those large 
super computer jobs that run for several days but they're probably best 
served by explicit allocation of processes to CPUs using the process 
affinity mechanism.
