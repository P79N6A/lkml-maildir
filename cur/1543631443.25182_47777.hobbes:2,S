Sounds like exactly the same problem we were having. There are two
approaches to solving this - Andrea has a patch that tries to free them
under memory pressure, akpm has a patch that hacks them down as soon
as you've fininshed with them (posted to lse-tech mailing list). Both approaches
seemed to work for me, but the performance of the fixes still has to be established.
I've seen over 1Gb of buffer_heads ;-)
