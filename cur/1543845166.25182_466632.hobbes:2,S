hi Haavard,

The platform_data structure is currently defined in
include/asm-arm/arch-at91rm9200/board.h as:
struct at91_uart_data {
	short	use_dma_tx;	/* use transmit DMA? */
	short	use_dma_rx;	/* use receive DMA? */
};
I don't think the DMA-support is currently in mainline, but is in the
pending patches on 
http://maxim.org.za/AT91RM9200/2.6/
I guess we can just add another field:
	short	no_remap;	/* base address is already mapped */
(or something similar)
Regards,
  Andrew Victor
