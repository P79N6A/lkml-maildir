	Hello,
	After upgrading to latest 2.4.2-ac23 (that includes latest changes
from 2.4.3-pre6) X doesn't start anymore. It was working perfectly for
2.4.2-ac20. I'm using DRI CVS, but it seems to have little to do with DRI
as disabling completely DRI doesn't help. 
	After starting X the system hangs up, the screen goes black but it
keep syncro, no way to kill or restore the original console although
SysRq boot still works. I'm going back to ac20, if you need more info I
could test other kernels (ac21, ac22).
	Regards,
	- german
PS: I'm running SMP kernel on dual PII450 on a P6DBU Supermicro board (BX
chipset).
