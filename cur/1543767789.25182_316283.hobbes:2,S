Well, there are a lot of ifs and buts. Some domains won't implement
fork balancing, others won't do newidle balancing, wake balancing,
wake to idle, etc etc.
I think my idea of allowing max_interval to be extended to a
sufficiently large value if one CPU goes idle, and shutting off all
CPU's rebalancing completely if no tasks are running for some time
should cater to both hypervisor images and power saving concerns.
While not being very intrusive to normal operation of the scheduler.

No. I think tou are right in that we'll want to make sure cpu_load is
zero before cutting the timer tick.

Yeah something like that should do it.
