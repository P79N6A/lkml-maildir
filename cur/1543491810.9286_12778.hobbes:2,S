I just move my system from 2.0.35, which worked great using DHCP to connect
through TCPIP through a cable modem.   Since replacing the Kernal with
2.2.x(I have tried 2.2.0, 2.2.1, 2.2.2, and 2.2.5) I know it still works
since I can use it under the Wintel side of the machine as well as from the
2.0.35 Kernal.  But under the new Kernals I can't get the system to aquire
an IP via DHCP.  Any ideas or suggestions?
