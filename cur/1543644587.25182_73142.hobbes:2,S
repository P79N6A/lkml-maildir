Hello linux experts,
I don`t know if i come to the right place
I have a HP 4100 server with LSI 53c1010R SCSI controller. I use 
RedHat7.3 os with default kernel 2.4.18-3. Also i have 3 scsi drives 
36G Ultra3 firmware HP. All thins are ok till here.
I need some help to test HOT SWAP feature for this drives. I read some 
documentation and i saw that HOT SWAP may work if my driver for 
scsi-controller support re-scanning the bus.
[snip]
Normal SCSI hardware is not hot-swappable either. It may however work. 
If your SCSI driver supports re-scanning the bus, and removing and 
appending devices, you may be able to hot-swap devices.
I try to check if this feature works for me and don`t. If i remove any 
scsi drive, this device remain in /proc until will be removed manually, 
or using a script named rescan-scsi-bus.sh which i found it on google.
I try to obtain some additional info and i saw that for my 
scsi-controller has 2 active drivers: one older named sym53cxx.o and 
one newer named sym53cxx_2.o!
I don`t have for the moment access to this computer but i remember that 
on default installation, redhat assigned the old driver to my 
scsi-controller.
I want to know if i change the driver with this new one, i can use the 
HOT SWAP feature!
Are necessary additional settings to be made when i load the new driver 
or on the system configuration?
Any success story will be appreciated.
Regards,
Alex
