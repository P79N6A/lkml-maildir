I am trying to get my serial console to work so that the next time my
machine has an Oops, I can capture it into a minicom buffer.  For some
reason it doesn't seem to be working.  I read serial-console.txt, and here
is what I did:
   cd /dev
   rm -f console tty0
   mknod -m 622 console c 5 1
   mknod -m 622 tty0 c 4 0
then lilo.conf looks like:
boot=/dev/sda
map=/boot/map
install=/boot/boot.b
prompt
timeout=50
image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.2.5
        label=linux
        append="mem=128M console=ttyS1,9600 console=tty0"
        root=/dev/sda1
        read-only
re-ran /sbin/lilo
I ran a null modem cable from /dev/ttyS1 to /dev/ttyS0 on another machine,
and started minicom with 9600/8/n/1 on ttyS0 of the other machine.  I can
do:
echo "foo" > /dev/ttyS1 on the one machine and sure enough it goes to
ttyS0 (my minicom session).  But anything that goes to /dev/console
doesn't ever make it to my minicom.  Is their something I am leaving out?
