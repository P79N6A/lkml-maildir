I have it compiled in, but it is not loaded: on a freshly booted kernel, 
dmesg | grep sonypi results in nothing, and if I try to load it manually:
# modprobe sonypi
FATAL: Error inserting sonypi (/lib/modules/2.6.11-rc1/kernel/drivers/char/sonypi.ko): No such device
and in syslog:
sonypi: request_region failed
which is correct, because this laptop doesn't have a sonypi devive, it is
a PCG-FX701. I will nuke the module and try to reboot, but I do not think it
will make any difference.

It's happened between 2.6.7 and 2.6.9; the only differences I can see in the
.config are the following: 
+CONFIG_ACPI_BLACKLIST_YEAR=0
+CONFIG_SERIO_RAW=m
... but I do not think they could make any difference. I will compile a
2.6.11-rc4 and try, but... 
Anyway, I have put the dsdt from cat /proc/acpi/dsdt in

Thank you for the help.
