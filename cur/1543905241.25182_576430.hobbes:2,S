In which case register via the legacy ports first, and then register
PNP ports.  If the PNP ports correspond with legacy ports, they will
re-use those slots.
So, if we register 0x3f8 first (which ends up as ttyS0), followed by
0x2f8 (ttyS1) and then PNP tries to register a port at 0x2f8 then
0x3f8, you'll still end up with 0x3f8 being ttyS0 and 0x2f8 as ttyS1.

However, aren't PNP serial ports attached to separate PNP devices?  If
so, udev can work it out already - they just need to look at the
backing device associated with the serial port.  For legacy ports that'll
be serial8250.0.  For PNP, it'll be some PNP device.
