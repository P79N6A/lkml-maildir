^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The kernel doesn't know if a process is going to use the FPU when
a new process is created. Only the user's code, i.e., the 'C' runtime
library knows. If the user is using 'asm' or whatever, the user must
initialize the FPU before using it, otherwise, the user doesn't know
anything about its state and the results ... (let's see, what was at
TOS, errm, is this a NAN?). The results are indeterminate.
