On a home PC with 2 IDE hard disks, max of around 16 partitions
total, and a maximum useful simultaneous mount count of around
16-32 ever being used in the forseeable future...
Would it be any form of an optimization to reduce super-max via
/proc/sys?  I was thinking it might reduce some overhead, perhaps
freeing up a page or two of kernel memory or something.
I'm just learning some of the details of the /proc/sys files, and
want to experiment in an attempt to both understand it all, and
to optimize the system, as well as to know how to optimize other
systems as well.  I am using the docs in Documentation as my
guide.  
---- Reference ----
super-max & super-nr:
These numbers control the maximum number of superblocks, and
thus the maximum number of mounted filesystems the kernel
can have. You only need to increase super-max if you need to
mount more filesystems than the current value in super-max
allows you to.
