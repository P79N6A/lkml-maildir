Try this:
1. At one prompt, do "cat".
Now, switch to another prompt and...
2. Do "pstree -p|grep cat" to find out the PID of your cat command.  I
get 20502.
3. Do "cat /proc/20502/wchan".  I get "0" here.
4. Do "strace -p 20502".  I get "read(0,  <unfinished ...>" here.
So wchan says cat is waiting for "0".  Strace says cat is waiting for
read (which sounds much more probable to me).
Is "0" the correct contents of /proc/20502/wchan?  I expected it to
say something about "read".
According to "man proc", wchan "is the "channel" in which the process
is waiting.  It is the address of a system call".  "0" doesn't seem to
fit that description.  Is "0" or the man page wrong?
I'm on Ubuntu 7.04 Feisty, i686, have manpages "2.39-1", kernel "Linux
version 2.6.20-16-generic (root@terranova) (gcc version 4.1.2 (Ubuntu
4.1.2-0ubuntu4)) #2 SMP Fri Aug 31 00:55:27 UTC 2007".
