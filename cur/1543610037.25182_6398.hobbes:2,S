It means that the request was not sane anymore, or specifically that
clustered number of sectors was set to lower value than current number
of sectors (which isn't valid, of course). The buffer-list destroyed
comment tells you that this corruption is most likely due to the
buffer_head list on the request having been corrupted -- which in turn
probably means that someone seriously screwed this request.
hda8: bad access: block=5296, count=-2                            
end_request: I/O error, dev 03:08 (hda), sector 5296
hda8: bad access: block=5298, count=-4
end_request: I/O error, dev 03:08 (hda), sector 5298
hda8: bad access: block=5300, count=-6              
end_request: I/O error, dev 03:08 (hda), sector 5300
This errors would seem to backup that theory :-)
Is this an SMP board? Also, is
end_request: buffer-list destroyed
the very first error message?
