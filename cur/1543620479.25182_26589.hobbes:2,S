Read-write semaphores should never be used.  As others have pointed out,
they cause really intractable priority inversion problems (because a
high priority writer will often have to wait for an unbounded number of
lower priority readers, some of which may have called a blocking
function while holding the read lock).
Note that I'm not talking about read-write spinlocks, which are (or
should be) held for a short, bounded time and can't be held over a
blocking call, so they are not quite so problematic.
