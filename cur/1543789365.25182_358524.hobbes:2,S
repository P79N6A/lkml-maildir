Since Jesse found that we really need to read & write back the 
PCI_CACHE_LINE_SIZE, I gather the workaround has to stay in ohci1394 
(and should be triggered by dmi_check_system), doesn't it?

Thanks a lot for the survey. Do they all _need_ the patch, or do some of 
them need it and the others are just not harmed by the patch?
Does anybody know a DMI_PRODUCT_NAME of a Libretto L1? Something like 
PAL1060TNMM or PAL1060TNCM?
