AFAICS, the main downside of simply increasing MAX_ARG_PAGES is that
fixed-size array in `struct linux_binprm'.  You've solved that via kmalloc,
so can we avoid the sysctl?  We can now increase MAX_ARG_PAGES to something
ridiculous with basically no cost?  It's swappable memory and should be
limited by the RLIMIT_RSS which we don't implement ;)
Also, I'm not sure that we need max_arg_pages_min and max_arg_pages_max -
it's a privileged operation and we can just let root decide whether or not
to screw up the machine.
