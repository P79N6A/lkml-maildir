Until you stop violating our copyrights with the VMWare ESX support nothing
is going to be supported.  So could you please stop abusing the Linux code
illegally in your project so I don't have to sue you, or at least piss off
and don't expect us to support you in violating our copyrights.  I know this
isn't you fault, but please get the VMware/EMC legal department to fix it
up first.
