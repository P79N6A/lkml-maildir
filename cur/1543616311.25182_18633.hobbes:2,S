	No, I think Morten has the use of PsiHost right.  The
entries in PsiHost are apparently stored by IRQ.  It is not generally
the case that the first controller is at PsiHost[0], the second at
PsiHost[1], etc.
	I agree with Jens in that the practice is rather ugly, but that
is the way the driver worked before io_request_lock disappeared and
I think that improving that stylistic issue is not a prerequisite
for conversion from io_request_lock to host->host_lock.
	If I were you, Morten, I would go ahead with your patch
that makes the minimal changes and then, if you want, make stylistic
improvements as one or more separate patches, which are something
that you may want to talk over with the mainter of that driver, if
there currently is one.
