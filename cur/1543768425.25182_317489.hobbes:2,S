What if proc filesystem is removed from the kernel?
Ability to access some other namespace through the proc filesystem does
not look clean. I think it should be cleanly supported through VFS.
Also cd'ing into a new namespace just allows you to browse through
the other namespace. But it does not effectively change the process's
namespace.  Things like mount in the other namespace will be failed
by check_mount() anyway.
I think, we need sys calls like sys_cdnamespace() which switches to a
new namespace. 
Effectively the process's current->namespace has to be modified,
for the process to be effectively work in the new namespace.

 clone/unshare will give you the ability to share/unshare a know
namespace. But to share some arbitrary namespace to which a process
has access rights to.
