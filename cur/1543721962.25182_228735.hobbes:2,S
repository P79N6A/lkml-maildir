Well, I knew about it, but I thought it's a "host" problem and device
drivers don't have to care.

I understand that currently the bit in question is cleared from the
masks, and that the ARM/SA1111 dma/pci alloc/map functions know how
to handle such mask?
Wouldn't it be better to not touch the masks (which are device
capabilities rather than platform limitations) and let alloc/map
functions always use the correct half of RAM?
Just asking, I've never worked with such thing.
