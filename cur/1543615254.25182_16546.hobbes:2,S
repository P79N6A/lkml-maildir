System.map is not required for everyday use of the OS.
It contains symbols which are useful for debugging and
such.   In normal usage, you can ignore the warnings which
as spit out by "ps", and others (?).  
	Of course, you can copy over the new System.map
file to /boot,  but their is no (easy) way of having more than
one active version via "lilo" or "grub".   And that could be 
considered a deficiency of the Linux OS.
