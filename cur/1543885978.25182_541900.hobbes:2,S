Subject: [RFC] memory hotremove patch take 2 [08/10] (memap init alignment)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/8/682

If there is small hole at end of a section, there are not initialized pages.
To find it, messy check is necessary at many place of memory remove code.
But, reserved bit by initialization is enough for most case of them.
