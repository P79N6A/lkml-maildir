you communicate every system-call to a user-mode daemon that
does whatever you want it to do, including phoning the National
Security Administrator if that's the policy.

Oviously wrong.
Also, there are existing system calls that are not in use.
You can modify your copy of a kernel for whatever you want.
Example system calls that simply return -ENOSYS are
break, stty, gtty, prof, acct, lock, and mpx. That should
be enough entry-points to muck with.
