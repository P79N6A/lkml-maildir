I have been pointed to eCos's config language, which seems to have a lot
of desireable properties:  it seems compatible with our needs (no global
dependencies, all info in one file, just-plop-down-driver.conf like),
it's implemented, fully documented, and most importantly (IMO),
it looks possible to modify their config parser to read CML1, which
allows us to (a) prove the new design and (b) transition slowly.
Language overview and some quick samples:
