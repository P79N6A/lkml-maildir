I have an sb16 with that dreaded ide port <g>  Anyway, I've used it to copy
hard drives in the past (I had 3 ide hdds and a cdrom at that time).  It
wasn't pnp either, but I have another machine with a pnp sb16.  The only
catch I've found is that you probably need a bios that supports pnp (this
machine doesn't have isapnptools installed and the pnp sound card is setup
by the bios and works).  I tried it with a hard drive on the sb card and it
found it upon bootup.
Maybe all you'd really need is a machine with a pnp bios?
