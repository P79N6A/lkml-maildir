    The lockfile was the first reason why we did the symlink. The
/etc was readonly and mount failed.

    You're completely right ;) But, just as I told before, I have no
good solution. I don't remember clearly, but I think that we use
finally another solution for the embedded system, by using a 'fake'
etc, writeable, and after booting, mounting a readonly etc over the
old one, or something like that. Pretty good (I suppose) for the
embedded system, but not a solution for everyday use, IMHO.
    By now I will do with /etc/mtab, but I think I will replace it
with a symlink to /proc, no matter if I lose options, etc... And
really I would like to write my own mount, just for my system, as
I've already done with other binaries. That's what I like free
software: I can write my own software without doing all the work from
zero, using the brains of people far more clever than me for helping
in the effort ;))
    BTW, thanks for your interest in the issue :))
