I want to add one more thing to this and then I'll shut up.  
The thing that I really love the most about Linux is that the guys in charge
seem to take the long view.  I personally would like my children - if they
want to - be able to use and work on Linux.  And their children.  In other
words, 100 years from now, it would be very nice if Linux was a healthy 
operating system.
If you take the view that only code that you'd want the next generation to
see should go in Linux, that helps your decision process.
The cool part of all this is that Linus/Alan/Dave et al seem to be doing
this already.  It would be nice if everyone had this approach - in 100
years, we'd have the perfect operating system.
