	Sigh...
	I knew it when I saw the first message that this was going to
become one of THOSE threads from hell that won't die, even if they don't
amount to a hill of beans...  One of those religious type topics where
everyone has an opinion on...
	Ok...  My contribution to the noise...

	I vote for four levels!
	/4   - Production --- Comfortable woobie (security blanket)
	/4+1 - Beta --- Adventerous and/or recently released from asylums
	/4+2 - Development --- Bleeding edge masochists
	/4+3 - Dearly Beloved We are Gathered Here --- Go for the gusto.
	Ok, ok...  A joke already...  Don't hit me!  :-)
	Having helped with the 2.1.12x "flue" and the recent 2.2.8 fiasco,
I know the feeling of that last category...
	I think the current system has served us well enough that others
have been following the example.  Whether one person or another thinks
it can be "improved", it still works.
	First law of engineering:  If it ain't broke - DON'T FIX IT!
	It ain't broke, so don't fix it!

	I agree.  Two branches with "pre", and "-ac", and "-az" et al...
patches seem to work incredibly well.  Leave it alone!
