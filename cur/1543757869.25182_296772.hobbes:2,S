 	The reported IRQ is bogus until you make that

 	feature.
 	Also, make sure that your .config for the Dell looks
 	something like:
 	CONFIG_X86_IO_APIC=y
 	CONFIG_X86_LOCAL_APIC=y
 	CONFIG_PCI=y
 	# CONFIG_PCI_GOBIOS is not set
 	# CONFIG_PCI_GODIRECT is not set
 	CONFIG_PCI_GOANY=y
 	CONFIG_PCI_BIOS=y
 	CONFIG_PCI_DIRECT=y
