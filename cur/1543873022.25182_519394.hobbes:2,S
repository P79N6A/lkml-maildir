this can solve the specific problem (and since 'nice' is the natural way to tell 
the kernel this, it's not even a one-shot solution).
however Linus is right, the real underlying problem is where the user is 
waiting on a server. if this issue could be solved then a lot of things would 
benifit.
Con, as a quick hack (probably a bad idea as I'm not a scheduling expert), if a 
program blocks on another program (via a pipe or socket) could you easily give 
the rest of the first program's timeslice to the second one, without makeing it 
loose it's own?
I'm thinking that doing the dumb thing and just throwing a bit more CPU at the 
thing you are waiting for may work. (assuming that the server process actually 
does something useful with the extra CPU time it gets)
as far as latencies go, it would be like turning every process on the system 
into a cpu hog.
