Ack, the 0xff0000 comes from the vesa bios, and it probably knows
how much video memory it has...

100% agree.  Would be nice if the mtrr code could handle this automatically
and hide the implementation details, so this has to be implemented only once.
And if the power-of-two-size limit goes away in the future, only the mtrr
code must be adjusted, not all applications/drivers which are using this
interface.
