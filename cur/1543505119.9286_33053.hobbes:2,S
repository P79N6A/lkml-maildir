I expirienced something similar, and the cause (in my case) was that at the
time of the close(), some data was in the _RECEIVE_ queue. DaveM explained
me that closing a socket in this situation is an error and the socket is
closed as such (ie no flush).
In other words: you have to make _sure_ there is no incomming data pending.
