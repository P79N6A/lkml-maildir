So you are saying: "Dump GRUB and lilo, use Gujin!" ??
I don't think anybody will agree with that even if it is a better way in some way.
Until some level of compatibility is guaranteed with the currently de facto loaders, at least I 
cannot support this idea in any way. Discussing that with GRUB and lilo devs, might be an idea, but 
who knows.
