If you change loopback backing-device, you just turn this nicely 
reproducible example into a subtle race condition that can happen whenever 
you use loopback or not. Think, what happens when different process 
dirties memory:
You have process "A" that dirtied a lot of pages on device "1" but has not 
started writing them.
You have process "B" that is trying to write to device "2", sees dirty 
page count over limit, but can't do anything about it, because it is only 
allowed to flush pages on device "2". --- so it endlessly loops.
If you want to use the current flushing semantics, you just have to audit 
the whole kernel to make sure that if some process sees over-limit dirty 
page count, there is another process that is flushing the pages. Currently 
it is not true, the "dd" process sees over-limit count, but there is 
no-one writing.

I will try 2.6.24-rc2, but I don't think the root cause of this went away. 
Maybe you just reduced probability.
