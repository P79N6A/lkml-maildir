Under 2.2.0-pre3, I see the following error when booting:
hdc:hdc: set_multmode: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hdc: set_multmode: error=0x04 { DriveStatusError }
hdc1 hdc2 < hdc5 hdc6 hdc7 hdc8 hdc9 >
The drive in question is a Seagate 4.3 GB UDMA, model ST34321A.
Otherwise things seem fine.  This error message does not appear when
booting 2.1.132.
