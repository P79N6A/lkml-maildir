Two reasons:
1) Sometimes I don't want any type checking because it would create
   the necessity of adding a new include to a file --> a circular
   dependency to resolve.  Macros hide the types except in the
   cases where they are actually invoked :-)
2) Historically GCC was very bad with code generation with inline
   functions, so at that time the GCC manual statement "inline
   functions are just like a macro" was technically false :-)
   Yes, I know this is much different in today's gcc tree, but
   there hasn't been a gcc release in over 2 years so...
