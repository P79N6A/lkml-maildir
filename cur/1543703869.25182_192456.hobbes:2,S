then it's a different problem.
sb live has a single capture (record) device although it can play
multiple streams at the same time.  when both apps try to open
fullduplex, the later one is blocked, because the capture device is
already occupied.
if it's the case, it is not a bug but the correct POSIX behavior.
as a workaround, try to add the following to /etc/modprobe.conf:
	alias snd-pcm-oss nonblock_open=1
this will set the OSS PCM devices as non-blocking.
ciao,
Takashi
