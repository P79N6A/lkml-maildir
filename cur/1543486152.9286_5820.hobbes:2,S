post-install and pre-remove aren't good enough for something like mixer 
levels, where you will get a blast of noise between the initialisation of the 
card and the post-install script.
I once set up the Sound Blaster driver to use kerneld's persistent storage for 
mixer levels, and it was working happily until kerneld disappeared shortly 
thereafter. Now there is no mechanism available for such a task.
