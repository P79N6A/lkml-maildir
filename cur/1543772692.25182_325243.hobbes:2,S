I'm well aware of them Ian.  What I'm talking about is a somewhat different
broader notion that can be applied to things other than conditionals.
ex.
switch(whatever)
    {
    case blah:
        __attribute__((slowcode)) {
        /*
          An infrequently used, but plump block of code.
        */
        }
    case blahblah:
    ...etc...
    }
