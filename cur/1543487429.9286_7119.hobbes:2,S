Subject: [patch] workaround for solaris 2.5.1 and 2.6 FIN bug (ID 4083814)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Solaris has a stupid bug in its TCP stack that cause it to hang the
connection between linux-2.2.x and Solaris (with linux as server) once the
connection closes.
The reason is that linux-2.2.x is smart enough to save some good packet on
the network by setting the FIN flag in the latest packet of data if there
is pending data in write queue. But if such last packet gets reordered by
the network it seems that Solaris ignores the FIN flag and as first it
will think that the last octect is full of data while it's the FIN advance
(if I am thinking right I think this can cause some troubles), and as
second Solaris will not send back to Linux the FIN to allow Linux to go to
FINWAIT-2 from FINWAIT-1. So the connection will hang and the end of
the data has no way to be transferred correctly.
Sun just released a fix for Solaris but since I think there are still many
buggy Solaris 2.6 and 2.5.1 TCP stacks on the Internet, I taken the time
to implement a workaround for Linux.
The workaround is implemented as a sysctl. As default there is no
workaround. But if you:
echo 1 >//proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_solaris_fin_bug_4083814_workaround
you'll enable the buggy-solaris-compatibilty-mode on the Linux TCP stack.
Note that this make a difference only when Linux is the server. So large
FTP sites are likely to want to apply my patch and enable the workaround
in the meantime the bogus Solaris tcp stack will be fixed properly
everywhere.
This is probably useful also in Unversity like mine where there are many
old slowww Sun machines that are not likely to be patched until it will be
discovered the next root exploit ;).
Once the workaround is enabled you risk to generate 1 more packet on the
network every time you close a TCP socket.
Here the patch:
