Hi...
I have loaded the new kernel 2.6.0, but my Ethernet card is not working on it. Its Intel Ether Pro 100B. Could someone help me out with it. Its working perfectly fine with 2.4.21. Is there any special setting to be made for the new kernel? I have used module-init-tools-0.9.14 to install the modules.
Regrads,
Sumit
