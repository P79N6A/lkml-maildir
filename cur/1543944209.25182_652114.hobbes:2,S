There was work underway on that before (hw_breakpoint).  I'm not entirely
sure you want to use fancy stuff like that in kgdb.  It's nice for kgdb to
be as self-contained as possible, so you can debug everything else with it.
If you're going to rely on lots of higher-level infrastructure, it could be
using kprobes for its software breakpoint handling, too.
At any rate, I think it would be good if the hw breakpoint support in kgdb
were chopped out into a separate patch.  First make kgdb work with no code
touching debug registers at all.  Then a second patch can add the hw
breakpoint support.  The latter one can be mulled over or replaced with a
hw_breakpoint merge or just put off for a while because it's a big can of
worms to multiplex the use of the debug registers.
Thanks,
Roland
