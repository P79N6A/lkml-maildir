 I consider it final.

 The effect seems impossible, but I can't discuss with facts.  I need to
get at AMD processor documents to find out what are the conditions to
switch between the power-save states.  Perhaps this is yet another SMM 
bug.  E.g. the pair of PIC poll I/O accesses interacts with the SMM 
somehow.
 Unfortunately I lack time to dig into it right now -- perhaps someone 
else can do the research?
