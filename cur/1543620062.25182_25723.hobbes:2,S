Hi everyone,
hmm, the zisofs again. I think that's caused because the compress.o 
module gets included at a pretty late stage in the Makefile ( 
fs/isofs/Makefile ) for linking. From what I've seen in other Makefiles, 
all modules that export symbols are linked into the target object first. 
Please query the lkml message list for a previous mail from me with 
subject "2.5.3-dj1: fast zisofs compile fix". It has a small patch for 
that particular Makefile that moves compress.o at the beginning of the 
link list if zisofs is included. Not sure this is the right way, but it 
works.
Regards,
            Todor
