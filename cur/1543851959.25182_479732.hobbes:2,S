What ipc_lock() does, more or less.

OK, seems like it does handle that scenario.  Sorry for the noise!
And the other possible scenario, where the wakeup happens before the
assignment of NULL to msr_d.r_msr, be prevented by the two rounds of
rq lock (one in try_to_wake_up(), the other when the task actually
starts running).
