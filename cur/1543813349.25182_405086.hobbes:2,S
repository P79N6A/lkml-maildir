You're being rather hyper-technical and semantic here, aren't you? You
clearly can't distribute something you can't legally "prepare" in the
first place.

OK, 14 USC 106(2) gives me monopoly power, subject to certain
restrictions. You seemed to have missed my point, as none of the
restrictions you mentioned include creation of derivative software
programs for commercial distribution.

Your argument, if extended to fiction, is equivalent to "'An
elaboration of Gone With the Wind' is an idea." There may be such a
thing as an idea corresponding to "an elaboration of Gone With the
Wind," but once a reader has the embodiment of that idea in their
hands, a work subject to copyright has obviously been created, and
it's up to the courts to decide whether it's a derived work or not.
Linux is a copyrighted work, so "A Foo2000 SCSI driver for Linux 2.6,"
once it gets embodied in software, unless it's implemented in
userspace, is most likely going to be a work derived from the
copyrighted expression which is the linux kernel.
I don't think a software company is going to get away with declaring
that their driver is parody (though I've seen code that appears to be
a parody of computer programming generally), and if they're careful
enough not to use the same symbols as me... well, they won't have
created a derived work, but  other important senses of the word "work"
probably won't apply to their program, either.
Anyway, since I'm not a lawyer and no one is suing anyone, I'm really,
really done now.
Night,
Dave
