Thanks for the report, I have some thoughts.
I suspect that one reason beckers code works is that it uses IO based
access (slower, and different method) to the adapter rather than
memory mapped access.
The second thought is that the adapter is in D3, and something about
your kernel or the driver doesn't successfully wake it up to D0.  An
indication of this would be looking at lspci -vv before/after loading
the driver.  Also, after loading/unloading eepro100 does the e100
driver work?
A third idea is look for a master abort in lspci after e100 fails to load.
And a last idea is for us to instrument the reads /writes from/to the
device during init and see if everything is returning 0xffffffff, as
that indicates the I/O and/or memory bar is not enabled, or the
address returned from ioremap is invalid.
