[patch] dubious process system time.
The system time that is accounted to a process includes the time spent
in three different contexts: normal system time, hardirq time and
softirq time. To account hardirq time and sortirq time to a process
seems wrong, because the process could just happen to run when the
interrupt arrives that was caused by an i/o for a completly different
process. And the sum over stime and cstime of all processes won't
match cputstat->system either. 
The following patch changes the accounting of system time so that
hardirq and softirq time are not accounted to a process anymore.
