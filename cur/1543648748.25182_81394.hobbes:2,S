FYI.  I have always had X configured for ImPS/2.  My wheel problem came
about immediately after booting a 2.5 kernel and using the input layer.
Before I was running a 2.4 kernel with psaux -- X was handling the mouse
protocol.

Oops, I didn't acknowledge Vojtech's fix (that is, configure X for an
ImPS/2 mouse, not MouseManPlusPS/2). This works for me at least.
