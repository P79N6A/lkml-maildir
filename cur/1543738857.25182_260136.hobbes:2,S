He, a system without networking is a real measurement ? Ever heard of

Thats a major problem caused by "dumb" priority inheritence. The goal is
not priority inheritence at the very end. It's proxy execution, where
priority inheritence is a subset.

I'm not talking about automatic conversion of rules. I'm talking about
automatic conversion of different concurrency controls into a
equivillance function, which lets you better identify the neccecary
manual changes and leaves room for simple and non intrusive replacement
implementations.
