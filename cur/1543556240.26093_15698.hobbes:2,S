Well of course this is the case.  I specifically said that I am the only
one that ever ran the binaries.  Once you start distributing it to other
people, then they can request the source additions/modifications and you
are obligated to provide it.
Theoretically you could use software based on GPL'd code all throughout
a for-profit corporation and make boatloads of money using that
software.  As long as you don't distribute it to customers outside the
company, and as long as none of the employees using it ask for the
source and distribute it outside the company, nobody outside that
corporation has any right to the source even though it is being used for
profit.
