No I did not miss your point. I was commenting on the current code ;-)

I agree here. I was going to recommend to add a preempt_disable in the 
spinner. And keep the need_resched test. Then we should not allow 
preemption until we get all the way to the point of the schedule in the 
contention case, or when we get the lock.
When we get to the schedule() it then needs to be a:
	preempt_enable_no_resched();
	schedule();
