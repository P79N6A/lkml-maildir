Trust Arjan, modern cpus work as he describes.

I guess that means athlon 64 is 'old'.

1 sec decode @ 2GHz + 1 sec idle @ 1GHz: 143J
So even on your hw difference is not too big... and take a look at
numbers from core2duo.
Actually...
4 sec decode @ 1 core @ 1GHz: 57*4=228J
1 sec decode @ 2 cores @ 2GHz, then idle: 95 + 48*3 = 142+95 = 235J...
Ok, so it is still 	 win, but even smaller one..
