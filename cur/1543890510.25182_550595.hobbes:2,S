Are you sure? I'm not so sure, because
1) On bcm43xx the reverse engineers told us that the card
   returns 0xFFFFFFFF for no-irq-pending. Since b44 and bcm43xx
   are very similiar in IRQ and DMA I just thought it would
   be the case there, too. Just guessing.
2) PCMCIA cards usually return all-ones if you try to read a
   register of a card that's been removed. So it's good
   practice to check for this and bail out early in the IRQ
   path. Do PCMCIA cards (PC-card, not neccessarily a real
   16bit PCMCIA card) for b44 exist?
