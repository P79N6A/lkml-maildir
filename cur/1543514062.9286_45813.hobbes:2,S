Nick,
If you are using the first patch that I supplied, you will probably see
those messages.  Also, I don't think that solves the problem, it just
makes it so the system doesn't hang.  
The second patch, that adds a udelay(1) to all the OS_* macros actually
seems to fix the problem so that you would not see the messages in the
log.
