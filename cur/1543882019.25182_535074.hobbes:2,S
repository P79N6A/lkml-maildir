What I will NOT do:
Waste my time with tracking 2.6.22-rc regressions.
We have an astonishing amount of -rc testers, but obviously not the 
developer manpower for handling them.
If we would take "no regressions" seriously, it might take 4 or 5 months 
between releases due to the lack of developer manpower for handling 
regressions. But that should be considered OK if avoiding regressions 
was considered more important than getting as quick as possible to the 
next two week regression-merge window.
But releasing with so many known regressions is insulting for the many 
people who spent their time testing -rc kernels.
