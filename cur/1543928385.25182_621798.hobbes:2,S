Well, this is more-or-less how we all imagine that should be done eventually.
The main problem is how to implement it without causing too much breakage.
Also, there are some dirty details that need to be taken into consideration.

If there are any drivers that make their devices available via mmap(), that
won't be sufficient.
Probably, we'll need a two iterations over devices to handle all corner cases.
Moreover, for hibernation we need to resume at least some devices in order
to save the image, which shouldn't result in unblocking the waiting tasks.

Yes, I generally agree.
