Subject: [PATCH 3/7] RT: Only consider online CPUs when pushing rt tasks
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/11/301

task->cpus_allowed can have bit positions that are set for CPUs that are
not currently online.  So we optimze our search by ANDing against the online
set.
