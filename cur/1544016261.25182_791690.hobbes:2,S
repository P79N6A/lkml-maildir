Hi San,
Alan Cox pointed me at the /proc/<pid>/oom_adj file that controls the
oom-killer score for any process as being more than sufficent to control
the oom killer.
This makes me wonder why you wrote the android lowmemlorykiller driver?
What is that driver for that is not already present in the existing
oom_* values for every process?
thanks,
greg k-h
