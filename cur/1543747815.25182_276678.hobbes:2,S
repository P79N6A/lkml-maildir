Subject: [PATCH] Fix ALSA resume
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Some time ago, a patch was merged that removed pci_save_state() and
pci_restore_state() from various ALSA drivers. That patch also added
pci_restore_state() to sound/core/init.c but didn't add pci_save_state()
anywhere. This is needed since the core pci handling doesn't do this for
us anymore.
My laptop doesn't resume (gets what I assume is an ACPI timeout and
hangs solid) without this small obvious patch.
