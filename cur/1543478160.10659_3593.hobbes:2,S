In 2.2-pre5, in an NFS client, if I create a directory tree, move it, and
then try and tar up the newly created tree, I get:
    tar: Read error at byte 0, reading 4 bytes, in file BitCluster-0.3/version: Input/output error
    tar: Read error at byte 0, reading 694 bytes, in file BitCluster-0.3/Makefile: I
If I add in a 
	sync; sleep 5
before the tar, it works fine.  If this is not a known problem, I'll provide
a tar ball which will reproduce the problem.
