The PS3 hypervisor also splits each device in regions (cfr. partitions), with
different access rights depending the OS that runs on top of it. The old
virtual SCSI driver treated each region as a separate LUN.
As currently only one region can be accessed by Linux anyway, I didn't bother
supporting multiple accessible regions in the new storage drivers.
