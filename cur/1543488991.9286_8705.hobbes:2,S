Thanks to everyone who replied to my request!
After couple of recompiles I finally got to work menuconfig (wheew!). But
kernel compilation is failing in midst with a message:
gcc: Internal compiler error: program as got fatal error 11
make:***[init/main.o] Error 1
-- a bit further it gives this error:
gcc: Internal compiler error: program as got fatal error 11
make[2] ***[loop.o] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory /usr/src/linuxdrivers;
make[1] ***[_modsubdir_block] Error 2
make[1] Leaving directory /usr/src/linux/drivers;
make: *** [_mod_drivers] Error 2
ls : *.o no such file or directory
loop.c: In function 'do_lo_request;
loop.c: 282 output pipe has been closed
cpp:output pipe has been closed
I think it is egcs compiler error, because whenever I want to recompile it,
it fails with error messages. I looked all over for the binary version of
egcs-1.1.1 but couldn't find it. I installed egcs-1.0.3 (rpm ver) but it
installs itself in /usr/lib than usr/local/lib as does egcs-1.1.1.
Therefore, whenver I do: gcc -v, it gives me egcs-1.1.1 version. Do you know
by any chance if there any binary version of egcs-1.1.1 so I can untared to
/  and go on?
                                                                Thanks, Alex
