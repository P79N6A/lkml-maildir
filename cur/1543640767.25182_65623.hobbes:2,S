Yep.  FWIW, these are incorporated in the IA64 port patch released yesterday
too.  I'd love to see these included in the standard 2.4.x trees.
Patches available in a number of places:
bk pull 
http://mdomsch.bkbits.net/linux-2.4-gpt
As separate patches:
1)
http://domsch.com/linux/patches/gpt/linux-2.4-gpt-efiguidt.cset
has been in the IA64 port for a while.  This fixes the endianness issues
with the efi_guid_t type and adds the NULL_GUID definition needed to compile
the GPT code.
2)
http://domsch.com/linux/patches/ia64/linux-2.4-efihmove.cset
moves include/asm-ia64/efi.h to include/linux/efi.h similar to the 2.5
patches.  This is needed to allow the GPT code to compile on non-IA64
platforms too, necessary for the use of really big disks.
3)
http://domsch.com/linux/patches/gpt/linux-2.4-gpt-efiguidt-unparse.cset
has been the IA64 port for a while.  This fixes efi_guid_unparse for
endianness.
These need to be applied in the above order, as #1 touches efi.h,  #2
touches and moves efi.h, and #3 touches it then too.  All are already in the
ia64 port tree, but Marcelo and Alan don't have any of these three yet.
I've compiled this on x86 against BK-current building in GPT with no
troubles.
Thanks,
Matt
