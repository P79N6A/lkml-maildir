Al, don't blame Dave, blame me. I told Dave to use i_sem instead of a 
special semaphore, just because it seems to be the right thing.

Hmm.. I don't think the fs/nfsd/vfs.c case is "obviously" under i_sem.  
Certainly not from grepping. Where?
The hpfs/namei.c one definitely needs the removal of the up/down, though. 
Altghough for the life of me I don't see why the filesystem _does_ that at 
all, since it should have been done by the upper layers already, no?
Oh, and Andrew pointed out that in the ext3 case the BKL was forgotten.
