Why sorry? Do you mean that the linux-sound list is not dead and you saw
my message there?

But please note that opl3 is not enabled by the new driver, so people do
lose some functionality they used to have.

It is caused by an attempt to play at 5512 Hz. In fact, this time (I've
upgraded to test12-pre6 in the meantime) it hung very badly, so that even
"kill -KILL" doesn't help:
 3786 pts/3    D      0:00 sox spinout.wav -t ossdsp /dev/dsp
sox-12.16-7, RedHat 6.2. The same with sox-12.17.1. The later uses
SNDCTL_DSP_SPEED to set the rate, but still the message about ioctl 0x5401
appears in the log.

Maybe it explains why I'll have to reboot now to kill that "sox" :-/
