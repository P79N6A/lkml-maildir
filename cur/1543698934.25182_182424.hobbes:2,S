So do you think Ross has found the connection between all three issues?  (Timer and NMI watchdog, IRQ 7, and CPU disconnect?)
I suppose we should now try these changes other the last two.  From what he's saying, this will fix the lockup too.  Hopefully the patch will be refined =).  I probably won't be able to run this till tomorrow, and after I get it diffed for 2.6.  I've barely got the cpu disconnect patch going today, but haven't tested it because I can only access my nforce2 machine remotely =).  But from everything I'm hearing, the lockups are gone.
