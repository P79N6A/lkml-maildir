I also was quite surprised that openvz appears to have no way of
constraining a container's memory usage.  "I want to run this bunch of
processes in a 4.5GB container".

A well-set-up container would presumably be working against its own
spindle(s).  If the operator has gone to all the trouble of isolating a job
from the system's other jobs, he'd be pretty dumb to go and let all the
"isolated" jobs share a stinky-slow resource like a disk.
But yes, swap is a problem.  To do this properly we'd need a way of saying
"this container here uses that swap device over there".
