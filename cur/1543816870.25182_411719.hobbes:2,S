Hello,
This is just a question about intended meaning in a paragraph  
at the end of the "What are memory barriers?" section.

Seems like the subject of "will never happen" is the read from memory for the 
asmt to X, but does that sentence say that?

Similarly, the read from memory for the asmt to Z won't precede the write of Y
to *A.

It seems to require more effort than necessary to understand in regard to
all that is presented in this document.
