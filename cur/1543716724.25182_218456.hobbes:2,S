But software doesn't detect collisions. It just records what
hardware said it did. It looks like you have a 10 Mb/s card
on a 100 Mb/s network. The collisions reported are how the
hardware throttles the difference in physical-link speed.
It is possible that software didn't initialize a 100 Mb/s
device and instead initialized it to 10 Mb/s, but you
don't have any evidence of that presented.
