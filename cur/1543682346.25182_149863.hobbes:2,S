... but there are many people who dream about swsusp for UMLinux.
Particularly some laptop users who want to suspend (at least the most
critical long-running applications) and/or find Linux way too unstable
and requiring frequent reboots.
The day UMLinux gets swsusp, I'm moving my XEmacs, mozilla and some
other toys into a UML machine and staying there. Hopefully then a single
problem with a USB driver, keventd running wild, or other frequently
encountered breakage won't be taking my entire world down.
