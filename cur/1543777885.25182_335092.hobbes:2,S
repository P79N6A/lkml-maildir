Miles,
while you're at it patching v850 here and there, could you please
also provide a resonable defconfig for v850, so that
$ make ARCH=v850 CROSS_COMPILE=... defconfig
$ make ARCH=v850 CROSS_COMPILE=...
works? Then my cross-compile tests at 
http://l4x.org/k
 could
probably provide somewhat meanigful results for this arch?!
Thanks,
-- 
Jan
