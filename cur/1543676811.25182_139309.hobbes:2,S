The criticism was of the maxim invoked, not the specific direction
you're hacking in.

If there's a TSC, it can be used for extra interpolation. But I think
timer_tsc already does that. I don't think it's quite so laughable; the
machines missing reliable time sources are truly crippled in some way,
by obsolescence or misdesign. I wouldn't call this a deficit. The
major platforms will do fine, and the rest will do no worse than now
apart from perhaps some function call and arithmetic overhead.

I don't know that there are answers better than mitigation.
I propose we err on the other side of the fence and back off as cases
where the larger instantaneous variances are more clearly needed arise.
