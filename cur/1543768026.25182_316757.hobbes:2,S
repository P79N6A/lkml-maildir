This is precisely what I had proposed in my watchdog implementation.

True.

Well, there is this imbalance_pct which acts as a trigger threshold before
which load balance won't happen.  I do take this into account before
waking up the sleeping idle cpu (the same imbalance_pct logic would 
have been followed by the idle CPU if it were to continue taking timer
ticks).
So I guess your 1/idlecpus and the imbalance_pct may act on parallel lines.

RCU is taken care of already, except it is broken. There is a small
race which is not fixed. Following patch (which I wrote aainst 2.6.10 kernel
maybe) should fix that race. I intend to post this patch after test
agaist more recent kernel.
