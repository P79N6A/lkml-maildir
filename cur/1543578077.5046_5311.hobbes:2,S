i did tell Jes about our zerocopy work, months ago (and IIRC we even
exchanged emails about technical issues briefly). The changes were first
published in the TUX 1.0 source code last August, and subsequent cleanups
(more than 10 iterations) were published on Alexey's public FTP site:
	
ftp://ftp.inr.ac.ru/ip-routing/
i think this whole issue got miscommunicated because Jes moved to Canada
exactly when we wrote the fragmented-API changes. I do believe Jes will
like most of our changes though, and i can surely tell that the elegant
and clean code of the Acenic driver made these changes so much easier.
Jen's Acenic driver was the first Linux networking driver in history to
support zero-copy TCP.
