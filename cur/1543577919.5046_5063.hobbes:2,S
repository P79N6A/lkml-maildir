I had a prototype tmpfs in -test10 (ro so) times.  It based on ramfs
for all the metadata stuff and used the (old) shmfs code for swap-backed
data.  The only real problem the code had, was that it needed a ->allocpage
address_space method in place of page_cache_alloc() to directly swap-in
pages in ->read.  IF anyone is interested I could forward port it to 2.4.0
and the new shmfs.
