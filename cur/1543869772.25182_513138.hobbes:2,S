It is in fact possible that the floppy failure might just be from some 
timing-dependent thing, and the slowdown itself is the problem.
Although I do find that a bit unlikely, since machines these days are 
about a million times faster than they used to be, so even if it's 
unnecessarily slow, it shouldn't be noticeable for a floppy drive.

I'm inclined to agree. Considering that the patch is known to cause 
problems, and that it's apparently broken on x86 *anyway* (the 
idle_notifier_register function isn't even exported), and considering that 
it's clearly bad for interrupt performance and could have been done a lot 
better, I would suggest just ripping it all out.
And I think we should do the same for x86-64 too..
