I agree that this was true in days of yore.  But these days the irq
instructions introduce serialization points and, me thinks, may be much
more time consuming than the "++, --, if (false)" that a preemption
count implemtation introduces.  Could some one with a knowledge of the
hardware comment on this?
I am not suggesting that the "++, --, if (false)" is faster than an
interrupt, but that it is faster than cli, sti.  Of course we are
assuming that there is <stuff> between the cli and the sti as there is
between the ++ and the -- if (false).
