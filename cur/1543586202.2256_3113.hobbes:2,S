Thanks everyone,
	especially David, for explaining the MTRR problem to me in detail.
I could get the machine to work nicely by mapping all memory in MTRRs.
There are only two corrections I would like to make to Davids eMail:
> # cat >/proc/mtrr
> disable=2
> disable=3
> disable=4
> disable=5
> disable=6
> disable=7
> base=0 size=0x400000000 type=write-back
> base=0x400000000 size=0x4000000 type=write-back
> base=0x404000000 size=0x1000000 type=write-back
> ^D
1. it is cat >| /proc/mtrr
2. I was not allowed to do `base=0 size=0x400000000 type=write-back`, because of the overlap with the memory range at base=0x0fb000000.  So what I do is only disable 3-7, and then base=0x400000000 size=0x400000000.
Thanks alot,
	Robert S.
