Not all requests for memory from a specific node are performance
enhancements, some are for correctness.  With large machines, especially as
those large machines' workloads are more and more likely to be partitioned
with something like cpusets, you want to be able to specify where you want
your reserve pool to come from.  As it was not incredibly difficult to
offer this option, I added it.  I was unwilling to completely ignore
callers' NUMA requests, assuming that they are all purely performance
motivated.

I do not agree...
