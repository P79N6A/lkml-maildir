It should do so, pretty much, although you may end up with a lot of
inode indirection information polluting the first few blocks of the
executable if you do it this way.
However, any filesystem reorganisation will not help.  The trouble is,
the kernel assumes that binaries are allocated reasonably sequentially,
and so when doing clustered paging, it naturally reads in a 64K
contiguous lump of the file.  If you have reordered the file so that
each 64k chunk of data is occupying non-contiguous blocks on disk, then
you just end up making the kernel pager much less efficient.
