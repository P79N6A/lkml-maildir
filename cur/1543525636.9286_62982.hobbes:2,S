Has anyone done any research on what I called 'NUPA' -- NUMA for
processors, basically ??
This is probably a totally crazy idea, but I was wondering how possible
it would be for Linux to seamlessly support, say, a PowerPC Mac or Sun
with an x86 accelerator card.  Or, to get even crazier, offload some
processing onto a GeForce or one of those video cards with dual Rage128
chips.
If 'NUPA' support existed, it seems like a prerequisite would be
eliminating many of the scaling problems typically associated with
OS<->hardware SMP interaction.  ie. creating spinlocks useable by only a
small portion of the available processors in the system.  and that's
only the tip of the iceberg.
