It's certainly possible to make a mostly/partially SQL compliant query
engine which is lean.  We did so for the commercial version of BK, i.e.,
this does exactly what you think it does:
select ID,STATUS,SEVERITY,PRIORITY,SUMMARY
from bugs
where	(SEVERITY == 1 or SEVERITY == 2 or SEVERITY == 3) and 
	(PRIORITY == 1 or PRIORITY == 2 or PRIORITY == 3) and 
	(STATUS == "new" or STATUS == "open" or STATUS == "assigned")
order by
	ID
The code which implements that:
wc query.c select.y
    284     830    5679 query.c
    650    2033   13775 select.y
    934    2863   19454 total
SQL compatibility isn't the problem, full (and bloated) SQL implementations are.
