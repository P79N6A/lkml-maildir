By the way...

This formula will return nonsense if you'll feed it with voltage:
Ohms * 60 minutes? ;-)
I'd suppose you can get better accuracy if you'll divide it by
some constant (resistance, we can define new property for it),
but I still doubt it, because this formula doesn't work good
enough even for batteries reporting charge. ;-)
It's interesting what actual values you're getting and how they
accurate.
There is another option though: if you know battery charge
full/empty thresholds (usually you know design values, they
should be written on the battery pack), then you can use this
formula to calculate "charge_now":
((voltage_now - voltage_min) * (charge_full - charge_empty)) /
(voltage_max - voltage_min)
And then you can calculate time as usual, using
charge_{now,full,empty} and current_now. But still, this is
very inaccurate, there isn't direct correlation between
charge and voltage. Oh well, power_supply_class.txt already
states about apm_power.c limitations.
So, with few cosmetic corrections I applied all your patches to
git://git.infradead.org/battery-2.6.git
I also applied few my patches I sent here earlier, hope they
don't break anything (at least they survived my tests).
Good luck,
