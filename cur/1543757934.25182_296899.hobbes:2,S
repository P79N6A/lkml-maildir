`xterm' is waiting for the other CPU to schedule a kernel thread (which is
bound to that CPU).  Once that kernel thread has done a little bit of work,
`xterm' can terminate.
But kernel threads don't run with realtime policy, so your userspace app
has permanently starved that kernel thread.
It's potentially quite a problem, really.  For example it could prevent
various tty operations from completing, it will prevent kjournald from ever
writing back anything (on uniprocessor, etc).  I've been waiting for
someone to complain ;)
But the other side of the coin is that a SCHED_FIFO userspace task
presumably has extreme latency requirements, so it doesn't *want* to be
preempted by some routine kernel operation.  People would get irritated if
we were to do that.
So what to do?
