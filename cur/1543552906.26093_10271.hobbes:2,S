I'm getting at least some kind of clue about the page cache, though I
don't claim to be an expert.  You've pointed out how the operation of
becoming a reader on a page can fail because the page disappears while
you're waiting.  That's an error, right?  It's the result of a user
space race, which in turn is the result of parallel processes doing
nonatomic file operations with no synchronization.  It sounds like
bailing out of the file_read if the page turns out to be unmapped after
the lock is the right thing to do, at least for a quick fix.

There actually aren't that many places where lock_page is called:

Maybe lock_page needs to return an error code.
