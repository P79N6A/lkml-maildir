Subject: incompatable pointer type warnings on some archs

I see that find_next_zero_bit() has a first arg of void* in about half
of the archs and unsigned long* in the rest (incl asm-i386/bitops.h).
Looking at incompatable pointer type warnings in a recent compile, I
found one where the caller was passing a u64*, thus the error.
Should all of the archs use a void* for this, or is there some reason
not to?
test_and_set_bit() and test_and_clear_bit() also have the same issue.
