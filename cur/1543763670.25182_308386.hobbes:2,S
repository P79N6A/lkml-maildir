I can understand this to a point, but it seems to me that after you get 
beyond some point you stop gaining from this (simply becouse you run out 
of bandwidth to keep all the heads busy). I would have guessed that this 
happened somewhere in the hundreds of drives rather then the thousands, so 
going from 1500x73G to 400x300G (even if this drops you from 15Krpm to 
10Krpm) would still saturate the interface bandwidth before the drives
