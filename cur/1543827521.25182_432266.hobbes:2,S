I'd prefer that the kernel default command line was appended
to the user-supplied one, instead of replacing it. (Or vice-versa.)
This way I can leave the user-specified command line empty and
get the behaviour described above.  Or, I can choose a few
specific options to come from the bootloader and have others
come from the default command line (in the kernel).
I'm VERY interested in this feature, for purposes of automated
testing on multiple architectures.  I have a test rig that can easily
set the command line at kernel compilation time.  However,
coming up with a mechanism to control command line options on
multiple different bootloaders, for the variety of embedded platforms
I deal with, is very difficult.  Right now this part of my
test rig works on all popular embedded arches except x86.
Eventually, I'd like to automatically test many different
kernel command line options, on multiple platforms.
