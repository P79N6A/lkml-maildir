To me the intel syntax is completely unreadable. But then again I grew up
on 6502 (Apple ][+), and later dabbled in DEC-10, VAX-11 (BSD) and a few
others, then worked a bit with 8086 under DOS. Never got to wrap my brain
around intel's syntax, even though it is the one I've used most.

So the pain is limited, and restricted to a part of the kernel that rarely
changes... better keep it consistent in that case. IMVHO.
