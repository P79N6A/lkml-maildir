NACK.  Please do a real conversion to the kthread paradigm instead of
doctoring around the trivial bits that could be changed with a script.
Please use kthread_should_stop() and remove the cmm_thread_wait
waitqueue in favour of wake_up_process.  The timer useage could
probably be replaced with smart usage of schedule_timeout().
Also the code seems to miss a proper thread termination on module
removal.
