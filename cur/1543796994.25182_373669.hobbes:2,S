FWIW, here is the longest latency I see with 2.6.14-rt22, with the same
preemption settings as 2.6.14 + PREEMPT.  AFAICT a longish network
softirq gets interrupted by several disk and network interrupts which
adds up to ~1ms.  Is there any easy way to break up this code path that
could be acceptable for mainline, or does this seem like a reasonable
lower limit on achievable latency (until/unless PREEMPT_RT gets merged
etc)?
