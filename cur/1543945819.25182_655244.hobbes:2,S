/home/bunk/linux/kernel-2.6/git/linux-2.6/arch/mips/au1000/common/platform.c:277: error: 'PSC0_BASE_ADDR' undeclared here (not in a function)
/home/bunk/linux/kernel-2.6/git/linux-2.6/arch/mips/au1000/common/platform.c:314: warning: no previous prototype for 'au1xxx_platform_init'
make[2]: *** [arch/mips/au1000/common/platform.o] Error 1

subarch setup good enough for knowing where to place them.
