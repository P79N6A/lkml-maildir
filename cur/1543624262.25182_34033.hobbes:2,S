Sure, that cleans up everything and sets all the version numbers back to ;1, 
but what I was pointing out is that previously created directories and previously
created files retain whatever version_limit setting they were created with.  After
running your four lines, the disk is cleaner, but you'll still get multiple versions
even if you don't want multiple versions for those previously created directories
and files.  I know, I just tried it with VMS 5.5-2. But this is all rather moot, 
since the real topic at hand is not what VMS does or didn't do in the past, but rather 
what we _might_ want certain linux filesystems to do (and not do) in the future.
