Hi folks,
I've disposed kmsgdump-0.3 on :
     
http://www-miaif.lip6.fr/willy/pub/linux-patches/
Finally, I haven't had time to integrate all changes I've been asked for.
Moreover, most of us are incompatible. So I'd like people to test it and then
we'll see what should be leaved and what should be kept for a more universal
newer version. The patch is only provided for stock 2.2.10 kernel, but with
a decent version of the patch utility (and perhaps a little hand patching),
it should apply to -ac* and 2.3.*.  I've made it on 2.3.5 and backported it
to 2.2.10. I only hope that the patch isn't broken because I didn't have time
to re-compile the kernel from the patch !
Waiting for your comments,
Willy
