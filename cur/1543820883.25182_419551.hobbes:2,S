Oh Len, let's call this thing IRQ why not ;) I kind of agree that this
is more popular and well-known term, like an old trade mark. I just see
all those layers of code right now to map those to GSIs, pins, whatever
it is, that can be replaced with... well, much smaller layers of code :)
and maybe less "assumpti-ous" too.
