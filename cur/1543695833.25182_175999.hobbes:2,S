Might be better to do something like:
mount -t devfs  none  /dev
mount -t proc none /proc
mkdir  -p  ram
mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /ram
cd /ram
mkdir proc  cdrom
mount  -t proc  none /ram/proc
/mount_cdrom
This is the start of my linuxrc script and creates the future root at /ram

man pivot_root
mkdir initrd
sbin/pivot_root  .  initrd
mount devfs -t devfs /dev
exec /usr/sbin/chroot . /sbin/init  <dev/console >dev/console 2>&1
(These is no automatic call to /sbin/init)
The documentation is bad insofar as root=/dev/rd/0 now fails
Also you will need to search for a patch to umount your old /initrd.  Please
feel free you email me direct for a very unofficial patch to linux-2.4.22
