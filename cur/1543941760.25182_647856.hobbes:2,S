But then it's converted to a pointer all over the place (same for
acpi_realmode).
Using (void *) will cause it to have the appropriate size and to be type
checked by the compiler in the C code.

OK
BTW, I don't like the way in which the 'struct wakeup_header' fields are
reproduced in rm/wakeup.S very much, because it makes the code fragile.
It might be better to define the offsets in asm-offsets*.c and refer to them
relative to wakeup_header (if possible).
