If you are sure the above is the right behaviour I can produce a patch
that will achieve the above.

Are you sure that we can avoid sending an ack even if we have more than
one not acked frame in the receive queue?
Where can I found a recent TCP spec, maybe I am reading obsoleted specs.

Agreed completly.

The minimum resolution is 10msec due the 100HZ timer.

500msec in the _worst_ case: it's an high bound not a low bound. Right now
the low bound is the RTO that is lowbound to 200msec itself. If you
decrease the lowbound of the rto then also the ato will decrease.
