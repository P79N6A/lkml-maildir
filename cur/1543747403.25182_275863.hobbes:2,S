*blink*
slower next time.

hm.  If I ever get a basic design off the ground (within the next month,
if ever), would you be willing to work with me on putting on polish and
possibly coding it?  Preferably I'd like to find some time to learn how
to code an FS myself-- though my goal is to make "the perfet file
system," so I can't imagine what use that'd have ;) (well, I could fail
the second time around-- I sure fucked up my first attempt last year).
Maybe you could give me guidance when I get to that point, if you don't
have time/will to do (what will inevitably become the bulk of) the work?
Of course, you don't HAVE to, and don't have to commit to this now; but
if you want, I'll poke you later about it.
