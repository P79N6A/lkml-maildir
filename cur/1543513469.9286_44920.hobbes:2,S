ok, this are very likely my boot-time allocation changes in pre4. I added
the beep so we know for sure that we are hanging due to a kernel BUG().
a quick test, does it boot (and produce useful messages) if you change
include/asm-i386/page.h's BUG define to only do the printk but not beep
and crash the box? Also, could you send me your .config.
