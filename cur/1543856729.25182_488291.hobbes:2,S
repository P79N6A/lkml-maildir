Hi Ivo,
I apologize for not responding to your post earlier, it was a busy week.
I am still not sure that tight coupling of input device with rfkill
structure is such a good idea. Quite often the button is separated
from the device itself and radio control is done via BIOS SMM (see
wistron driver) or there is no special button at all and users might
want to assign one of their standard keyboard buttons to be an RF
switch.
I think it would be better if there was an rfkill class listing all
controlled devices (preferrably grouped by their type - WiFi, BT,
IRDA, etc) and if every group would provide an attribute allowing to
control state of the whole group (do we realistically need to kill
just one interface? Wouldn't ifconfig be suitable for that?). The
attribute should be a tri-state on/off/auto, "auto" meaning the driver
itself manages radio state. This would avoid another tacky IMHO point
that in your implementation mere opening of an input device takes over
RF driver. Explicit control allow applications "snoop" RF state
without disturbing it.
If there are concerns that drivers will have to re-implement most of
the button handling you are still free to create a simple
implementation of polled RF button (I don't think that interrupt
driver RF buttons would share alot of code) so that users would only
need to implement a polling function.
