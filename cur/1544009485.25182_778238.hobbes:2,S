not annotating an IRQ entry is not a big problem in practice: people will 
notice them in traces that they are not annotated, will send a feature 
request, we annotate them. If they are not noticed, it means they are 
rare in one way or another, and dont matter in practice. So this is a 
self-maintaining concept.
