Up to 14 addresses translation per packet (sg_list) might be required on 
the transmit side. On receive side it is only 1. Most packets require only 
very few translations (1 or sometimes more)  translations. However, 
with more then 700.000 packets per second this approach does not seem 
reasonable from performance perspective when memory is fragmented as you
described.

This has a serious issues with constraint I mentions in the previous mail: 
"- MRs can have a maximum size of the memory available under linux"
The requirement is not met that the memory region must not be 
larger then the available memory for that partition. The "create MR" 
H_CALL will fails (we tried this and discussed with FW development)
