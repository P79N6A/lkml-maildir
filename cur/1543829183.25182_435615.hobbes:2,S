Hi Danial,
the most likely tunable that will help you is
/proc/sys/vm/min_free_kbytes
For the router kind of device that one usually needs bumping a bit;
without the bumping the VM doesn't see enough "normal" activity to tune
it's emergency/interrupt handling buffers (and most networking
allocations happen in interrupt context), and then ends up failing
allocations in interrupt context, which leads to dropped packets.
