   I want to know the tuning issues suitable for our solution. Also, we want to
   use a zero-copy api of udp, but we don't know usage of the api and whether
   it is support on Linux kernel 2.4.18. If it is supported, how can I find it.
Zerocopy is not supported for UDP.  It may be implemented in the
future.  If an when we will do this is unknown, so please don't ask.
