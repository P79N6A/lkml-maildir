My guess is that this is the problem.  You may get help here but I wouldn't
bet on it, these drivers are almost always distributed as binary modules.  
A module built for one kernel isn't likely to work with another kernel.  
Even if you have the source and compile it after installing a new kernel
source tree there is a high probability that it still won't work.  Try
contacting the folks that produced the Lucent driver.  Or better, get a
real modem.
Drivers for Winmodems and their relatives are usually not made by folks
that are willing to contribute the source to become a part of the kernel
source.  In such cases you are unlikely to get help from anyone except,
rarely, from the creators of the drivers themselves.
