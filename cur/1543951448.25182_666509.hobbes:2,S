How about the return address on the stack?

Purgatory is for all intents and purposes user space.  Because the
return address falls on the trampoline page we won't know it's
address before we call kexec.  But a return address and a stack
on that page should be a perfectly good way to communicate.

We need a fixed protocol so we do not make assumptions about how things
will be implemented, allowing kernels to diverge and kinds of other
good things.
For communicating extra information from the kernel being shut down
we have elf notes.
Direct kernel to kernel communication is forbidden.  We must have
a well defined protocol.  Allowing the implementations to change
at their different speeds, and still work together.

My gut feel is we look at the image and detect what kind it is, and simply
not enable image processing after we have read the note that says it
is a resumable core or whatever.

Make common cases fast to use.  The UI equivalent of make the
common case fast.
