It depends on what you want: There is little sense in implementing a nanosecond 
clock model with NTP when the result is wrong by several microseconds IMHO. You 
don't know what the time is used for, so just get the best you can. Thos only 
wanting some crude time, could be happy with the jiffies (or their equivalent), 
right?
