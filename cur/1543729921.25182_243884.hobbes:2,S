The difference is that Alan Cox has enough reputation that if he handwaves and
says something opaque about thinking that R/O permissions is enough to stop
something, the obvious explanations (in order of likelyhood) are:
1) He's found an actual hole, and is being intentionally obtuse until the patch
appears in the tree. (I've certainly seen *that* happen often enough, and I'm
not even what would be called an old-timer around here)..
2) It's something actually obvious, and his remark only appears opaque because
I'm an idiot and don't get it (that's been known to happen fairly often as
well).
3) He's actually full of it (much less likely than either of the first two)...
