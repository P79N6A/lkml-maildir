Hi,
is there a reason why the kernel (tested with 2.4.13) picks up the io port
region from 0020-003f for pic1? All I could find on the net lets me assume
that only 0020-0021 are used by the interrupt controllers (may be wrong
here - hints for literature are welcome). Same problem with pic2.
I'm currently working with an AMD Elan SC410 (x86 embedded system on chip)
which has it's private registers at 0022 and following, which makes it
impossible to write "correct" drivers that request_region() their ports
before using them.
Robert
