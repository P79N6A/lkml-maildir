Just enabling the hidden switch solved my setting and I think it solves
most of "problem" settings.

Well... it's just your opinion... other OS and systems don't use
netfilter of firewalling at all (ex. Win) and behave like with "hidden"
applied.
Really, the only one I have tested that not do it is Linux 2.2+
For me (not a kernel developer), my world are the OSI layers, and the
isolation of the interfaces at layer 2 IMHO should be in the kernel not
any firewall module that you must install, tune and configure.

I will look... but doing arp filter is not a real simple solution in
any way.
