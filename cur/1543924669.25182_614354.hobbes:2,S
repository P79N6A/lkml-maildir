Well... I realize there's no point in fixing things which I cannot
even see going wrong: I cannot get hold of another A2232 after the
one I had used before went missing.
So until someone contacts me to supply me with a A2232 card, this
driver is an "Orphan" now, sorry.
Changed "Orphaned" to "Orphan", as this is the official "S:" value.
Patch is against Linux-2.6.23.1 .
