Hi to all!
I have a problem with recent 2.6.22 kernel with cfs-19 patch.
While I'm watching the video using mplayer or listening to the music
using audacious the sound is interrupting rather often.
During I'm watching the video I don't really doing something heavy
with my computer. Besides ... when I try to renice mplayer to make it
priority higher[I mean lower with renice syntax 8) - renice -20 `pidof
mplayer`] - it helps for _some_time_.
my uname -a:
"Linux niam 2.6.22-cfs-v19 #3 Sat Jul 14 14:15:57 EEST 2007 i686
Intel(R) Celeron(R) M processor 1.50GHz GenuineIntel GNU/Linux"
I've attached .config of my kernel and output of `ps aux`. With this
tasks state my audio player interrupting ...
Thank you for your time and your help!
