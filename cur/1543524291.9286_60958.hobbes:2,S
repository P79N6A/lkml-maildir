I tried nfsd to export / (and everything below) which doesn't work for
mounts under /
I tried with and without sun nfs emulation (or whatever it's called). 
/proc/fs/nfs/exports shows this:
[root@xxxxxxx:/proc/fs/nfs] cat exports
# Version 1.0
# Path Client(Flags) # IPs
/       xxxxxxxxxxxxx(rw,no_root_squash,async,wdelay,crossmnt) # x.x.x.x
[root@xxxxxxx:/proc/fs/nfs]
(x's added so my stuff doesn't go out <g>)
I'm using nfs-utils from sourceforge (debian package nfs-kernel-server
0.1.6-1)
Any Ideas?  I would hate to go back to using userland nfs.  =)
