This was of course correct, when enabling the irq everything started
working correctly.  Why any of them was delivered, I don't know, might
be something wrong in the underlying layers?

Actually, I'm was getting about 630 interrupts per half second.
Basically I set a flag that tells the interrupt handler just to
increment a counter and return.  Then I set that counter to 0, set the
flag and do a schedule_timeout for half a second in the main driver
thread, turn off the flag and read out the variable.

That part actually worked nicely all the time.  The problem was the
interrupt servicing routine being called all to seldom, which your tip
fixed.  Thanks.
