No, it's tightening things up.  We don't have full revocation in any case, 
and the primary security check is performed on open.

This is the only place where we do this -- it's to remain consistent with 
the surrounding splice code, which does this for other checks.  Given that 
it's calling out to a typically non-trivial security module, it may be 
better to remove the unlikelys here.
