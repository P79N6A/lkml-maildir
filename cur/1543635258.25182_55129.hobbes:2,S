2 of the drives are on a UDMA/33 controller and i still have problems with
them
always have but they worked fine under 2.2.x i have always had problems in
2.4.x
i tend to post here every few months when it gets me pissed of about it
though this
is about the biggest response i have ever seen so far.
i can also see sombody else may have the same problems with ide-scsi but
with a
dvd drive it matches what i see with a drive when reading bad media.
