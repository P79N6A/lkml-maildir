Exactly, which is why I can't do any audio development under Linux at this
time and have moved to BeOS as my primary multimedia OS.
The time resolution of the GUI based controls is much better than anything
I've encountered by an over-bloated X Windows API. Their C++ based GUI is
exceptionally snappy and deferes/delays screen redraws during a Window
move/resize so the GUI doesn't lock for ridiculously long time periods.
I personally don't know how the ALSA folks are going to be able to deal with
these issues, synchronization of MIDI output, adaptive timing loops, etc...
