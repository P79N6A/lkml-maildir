Agreed.
I was recently looking at that spot because I found that niced tasks
were taking latency hits, and disabled it, which helped a bunch.  I also
can't understand why it would be OK to interleave a normal task with an
RT task sometimes, but not others.. that's meaningless to the RT task.
IMHO, SMT scheduling should be a buyer beware thing.  Maximizing your
core utilization comes at a price, but so does disabling it, so I think
letting the user decide what he wants is the right thing to do.
