> Shouldn't the calls to __remove_driver be done inside the device_lock?
No. If the driver needs to lock, it is free to use it. But, what the 
driver needs to do is up to the driver, and we don't want to force it not 
to sleep. 
But, the driver needs to be removed from the bus's list inside the lock, 
so if a device the driver supports gets inserted, we won't try and bind 
the two...Patch coming shortly.
