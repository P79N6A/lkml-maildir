Thanks. The LGPL usage is a mistake in the core code....will change to GPL
everywhere except the  case below. There's no intent to have the kernel 
code available
under other licenses etc. so thats not a problem.
However, the confusion about what license to use for a header file that 
will need to be
included in a potentially non-GPL user application persists. The header file
    include/linux/taskstats.h, created in patch 9/9
    
http://www.uwsg.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0603.1/1925.html
defines the user-kernel messaging interface and should probably continue 
to have LGPL,
just to be absolutely safe legally. I've not been following the legal 
twists too carefully so
its probably overkill.
