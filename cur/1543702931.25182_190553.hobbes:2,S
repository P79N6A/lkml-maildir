The bar contents seem to be real:
00:0f.0 Class ff00: Intel Corp. Extended Express System Support
Controller
        Subsystem: Unknown device 0008:2000
        Flags: fast devsel
        Memory at 20000000 (32-bit, prefetchable) [size=1K]
        Memory at 20000400 (32-bit, prefetchable) [size=1K]
        Memory at 20000800 (32-bit, prefetchable) [size=1K]
        Memory at 20000c00 (32-bit, prefetchable) [size=1K]
        Memory at 20001000 (32-bit, prefetchable) [size=1K]
        Memory at 20001400 (32-bit, prefetchable) [size=1K]
        Expansion ROM at fffff800 [disabled] [size=2K]
That sits just on top of my available memory.
However, the resource allocation code produces this on boot (this is
what kills the second IO APIC)
PCI: Cannot allocate resource region 0 of device 00:0f.0
PCI: Cannot allocate resource region 1 of device 00:0f.0
PCI: Cannot allocate resource region 2 of device 00:0f.0
PCI: Cannot allocate resource region 3 of device 00:0f.0
PCI: Cannot allocate resource region 4 of device 00:0f.0
PCI: Cannot allocate resource region 5 of device 00:0f.0
PCI: Error while updating region 00:0f.0/1 (20000408 != 20000008)
PCI: Error while updating region 00:0f.0/2 (20000808 != 20000008)
PCI: Error while updating region 00:0f.0/3 (20000c08 != 20000008)
PCI: Error while updating region 00:0f.0/4 (20001008 != 20000008)
PCI: Error while updating region 00:0f.0/5 (20001408 != 20000008)
I'll poke and find a flag to keep the range.
