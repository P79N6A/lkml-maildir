Looking at the source - usually foolhardy at least for me, I find this 
at lines 1806-1808 of sata_promise.c:
               case board_2037x:
        		probe_ent->n_ports = 2;
		break;
Is the solution here as simple as changing two to three? Does this break 
somethng else?
Has anyone else got this board to work? It's been out over a year.
