The character set used by the kernel is UTF-8. So we should check for
people trying to add invalid stuff in other character sets. There's no
way for them to _label_ legacy character sets as such; it's not like
MIME email where we can use a different charset for every mail and
expect people to cope. We need to be consistent.

checkpatch happy. And then forgot about it when I inserted the text file
