Yes, the newbie is obviously correct. The size of a directory ought
to be the sum of the sizes of all files below it plus overhead.
I suppose that includes indirect blocks, inodes, ACL data...
Note that the above would allow directory quotas. DG-UX has that.
Directory quotas kill some of the reasons to have many partitions.
If you want blocks, use the st_blocks member of struct stat.
It is redundant to make st_size be simply st_blocks*1024.
Unfortunately, the obvious "du" method requires updating all parent
directories when something changes. Hmmm, they should be in RAM.
The next best choice is "number of files", used to assist software.

That is an implementation detail. Users are not concerned with that.

First of all, real users don't do hard links...

Yes and yes. If you were to copy one of the directories somewhere
else, breaking the hard links, you would get a size calculated
in an obvious way. This should not be different; files do not
grow when you move them.
If I have a 4 MB file and I hard link it, I do not then see two
links that claim to represent 2 MB of data each. No, they both
show the whole 4 MB.

You can only inherit an mtime from one place, so you obviously would
update that one place. (inheritance means there is _one_ mtime on disk)
You have to ask for mtime inheritance anyway. With that being outside
of POSIX already, it is OK to ban hard links when mtime is shared.

The directory and files are tightly related. Inheritance means that
they actually share some inode data on disk. Reiserfs does not use
traditional inodes, so this is no problem.
