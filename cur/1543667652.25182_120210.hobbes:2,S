   This patch changes a flags argument to spin_lock_irq_save to unsigned long
   and removes its unused attribute.  The first gets rid of several warnings
   and the second is "obviously correct" (at least according to Rusty) :-).
Applied, thank you.
   Thanks to DaveM for forcing me to build kernels with a 64 cross compiler :-)
No problem. :)
