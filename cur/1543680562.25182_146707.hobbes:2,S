Well, I have one naive question. What prevents writes from eating the
entire request pool now? In the 2.2 and earlier days, we reserved the
last 3rd of the requests to writes. 2.4.1 and later used a split request
list to make that same guarentee.
I only did a quick read of the patch so maybe I'm missing the new
mechanism for this. Are we simply relying on fair (FIFO) request
allocation and oversized queue to do its job alone?
