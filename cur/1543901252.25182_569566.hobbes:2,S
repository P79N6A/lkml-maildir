A thread's kernel stack is a kernel allocation. If you'd fail to allocate it 
you'd supposedly _already_ have swapt out everything that could be swapped out.
Moreoveover -- literally two pages free was hardly his point. The point is 
just that (with a page being the allocation unit) single page allocations 
are guaranteed to succeed if _any_ memory is free, while two adjacent (yes, 
and stacksize aligned) pages will be pretty hard to get by once the system 
has been up and running for some time.
