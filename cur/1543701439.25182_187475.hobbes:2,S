Could this be a simple overheating problem?
Chess programs are cpu intensive, and so the cpu gets hot.
Perhaps there is insufficient cooling. the cooling may be
enough for non-cpu intensive stuff like email, web, and so on.
what happens if you run a big compile or a long-lasting
cpu benchmark?  Those things also cause heat.
