Made a short test here.
Added the following to a file:
static sam = "                    ";
clean-whitespace replaced spaces within "" with tabs.
cleanfile did not.
Seems that clean-whitespace has the wrong assumption that any sequence
of <tab-stop>8 spaces<tab-stop> must be replaced with a tab.
It should obviously default to beginning of file.
Running latest cleanfile (it is -mm) on your testfile
gave following output:
cleanfile: ipv6.h
ipv6.h:105: line exceeds 79 characters (89)
ipv6.h:111: line exceeds 79 characters (89)
ipv6.h:350: line exceeds 79 characters (85)
ipv6.h:356: line exceeds 79 characters (85)
ipv6.h:362: line exceeds 79 characters (85)
ipv6.h:386: line exceeds 79 characters (82)
ipv6.h:413: line exceeds 79 characters (85)
And spaces were replaced with tabs only where
it is safe.
