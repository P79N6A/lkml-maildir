Thanks,
  I reread the man page and see that the sa2_len parameter
to accept is value-result, and I should have initialized.
I missed it in my attempt to hack c code from the perl example.
Next time I'll compare the straces before I submit, but as
Pete points out, the problem is still there.
Thanks to all the readers for their comments,
