As Linus has pointed out, because of GCC not sharing stack among
different inlined functions, the above is surprisingly not true.
In kernel it's a problem due to raw stack usage.
In userspace apps (where stack used is larger), inlining single-call
functions could, paradoxically, run slower due to increased stack
dcache pressure for some larger functions.
