If my memory serves, then yes, including those messages.

If the horde of `out of momory' reports was any guide, not all was well
in there in any case. After all, if cc1 has just OOMed out, there
should be enough free pages that nothing else will OOM soon. Instead,
everything else in the testsuite run OOMed one after another, expect,
runtest, make, and all.
I thought it wasn't a kernel bug and so didn't preserve the logs &c
unfortunately; if it happens again (which it hasn't, yet) I will forward 
the relevant info to the list.
