short question - is it also possible to mark some "bad addresses" in a
quite similar way ? I know RAM is cheep these days but...
Memory with just one bad address or two would be good enough to be
able to use them in a desktop pc again if the kernel could make sure
that these addresses will never be accessed/used from anyone.
Next step for HA in servers then would be a memory raid ;-) but for
sure big blue holds some patents on this :(
