I thought that C/H/S addressing was purely a function of int 13, not the 
hardware interface?  If it is a function of some older hardware 
interfaces, then we are still talking about two different, and likely 
incompatible geometries:  the one the disk reports, and the one the bios 
reports.  The values in the MBR must be the values the bios reports.
