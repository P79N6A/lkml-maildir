the only reason is to avoid wasting the swap space, so at least Rik's
vm_swap_full logic should be added to it. The only advantage of dirty
swap cache persistence is that it will maintain the same position on
disk across a swapin/swapout cycle.
But anyways you can do that "swap persistence" work in do_swap_page too
to save a page fault for the write swapins. Ok, it's in one more place
but it will be less costly than running into another pagefault just
after returning to userspace.
