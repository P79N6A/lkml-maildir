No.  You can use /proc to do the same thing.  You can inherit
file descriptors, etc.  This isn't a door you can just close and ignore.
It is too easy to do this to assume you have closed every possible
way to get a descriptor from outside of ``container''.
Suppose you have user fred uid 1000 outside of any containers,
and you have user joe uid 1000 inside user uid namespace.  If you don't
make your permission checks (user namespace, uid) fred can do terrible
things to joe.
If I we don't do the expanded permission checks the only alternative
is to check to see if every object is in our ``container'' at every
access.  That isn't something I want to do.
I don't intend to partition objects just partition object look ups by name.
Which means that if you very carefully setup your initial process you
will never be able to find an object outside of your namespace.  But
the kernel never should assume user space has done that.

For using it yes.  But not for correct kernel operation.

That is their role in the kernel.  A flavor of key to handle uid
mapping needs to be added, but that is all.
