Subject: Change in NFS client behavior
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

We have noticed when changing from kernel 2.4.23 to 2.6.8 that
timestamps of files are not changed if opened for a write and nothing is
written.  When using 2.4.23 timestamps are changed.  When using a local
filesystem (reiserfs) with either kernel, timestamps are changed.
Symptoms vary with the client, not the server.  See the script below.
When run on a 2.4.23 machine in an NFS mounted directory, output is
"Good."  When run on a 2.6.8 or 2.6.12-rc4 machine in an NFS directory,
output is "Error."
Is this a bug?  How do we revert to the 2.4/local fs behavior?  
Thanks,
Rob
