Actually, a fair coin flipped N times is unlikely to come up heads
exactly N/2 times, and the probability of this drops quickly as N
grows.
What is true is that it will usually come up heads N/2 times, give or
take sqrt(N).  Mathematicians call this the "Central Limit Theorem".
For example, take N=32.  The square root of 32 is a little less than
6.  So we expect to see between 16-6 (i.e., 10) and 16+6 (i.e., 22)
heads in a typical trial.  (Of course, in one trial out of 4 billion
it will come up all heads.  The Central Limit Theorem is about "usual"
outcomes, not every outcome.)
So we expect between 10 and 22 odds/evens in your trial.

Well how about that.  Try it with larger N, and you will find it gets
even harder to hit a case where the total is outside the sqrt(N) error
margin.  And of course, as a percentage of N, sqrt(N) only shrinks as
N grows.
If you doubt any of this, try it with a real coin.  Or read a book on
probability.
