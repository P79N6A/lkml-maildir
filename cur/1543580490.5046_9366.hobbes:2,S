granted, it is possible that a different gas was used, but extremely 
unlikely. I have been known to build my own compilers (need to try libc 
some time), but haven't played around w/ binutils. box is Redhat 6.[01]? 
upped to Mandrake 7.1 a month ago.
haven't installed any new compilers lately, I think that 2.4.1 makefile 
is different, selects diff compiler (haven't found out the differences 
btwn Mandrake and RedHat yet)
grepped sources for that #define; did not find anywhere
Sorry for bad grammar, usually not this bad, very very tired, can't make 
fingers type straight half the time.
currently running 2.4.1 rebuilt with mem=192M. Hope this is resolved soon.
Also will consider trying to specify compiler to be same as 2.4.0 build 
(not likely a good idea, given that pgcc 2.95.x borks 2.4.1 
[fxsr_alignment IIRC])
Also will look for different as executables. BTW, pgcc above is actually 
2.95.3, not 2.95.2
I'm rambling and need sleep.
