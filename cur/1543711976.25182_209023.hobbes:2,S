Don't confuse unslabify and the ->list removal. The ->list removal went
around insisting the known universe stop using ->lru because of the
relatively arbitrary choice that slab.c use ->lru. The unslabify patch
attempts to update one user of ->lru by backing out the code using it.
Do note that non-list-heads like ->index, ->private, or ->mapping are
also unused on slab pages, and could have saved some pain for this
former user of ->list had they been chosen.
