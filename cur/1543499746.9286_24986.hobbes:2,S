I'm confused by what problem or problems are being addressed here.
I see the problem with systems that have a couple of i/o busses and 
add and remove storage devices from them 
and there is a related problem that also touches pcmcia/usb where 
devices can be plugged and unplugged.  For both problems we need some
sort of dynamic naming that makes sense and for the pcmcia/usb we need
a nice way to find drivers to load. Is there some other issue here
that I don't understand or is that it?
