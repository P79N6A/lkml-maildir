Hi,
  I have a user task running ...
I want my driver running in kernel to send a notification to this task when
it detects some event.
for example..if my driver detects that interface 'eth0' is coming up, it
should send a indication to user task saying 'network interface eth0 is up'
please cc me..
thanks
Amol
