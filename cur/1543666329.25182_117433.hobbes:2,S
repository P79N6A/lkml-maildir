Yes, an API is a matter of personal taste, and I don't particularly like
epoll, but that isn't really relevant.  What you seem to not understand 
is that kqueue is an event framework into which you plug different filters,
which have different capabilities.  You may not like this "multiplexing",
but that's part of the key to how kqueue works, and is THE reason it is not
just "Yet Another Notification Mechanism".
kqueue does not limit itself to the poll() interface, and hence can do 
things that are simply not possible with poll.  If you're just thinking
of epoll as a "faster poll", fine, but that's not what kqueue is, and 
viewed from that context, yes, some things may appear as "bloat".
If you think that kqueue filters can be done in user space, I don't believe
you undersand the problem.  Show me a single thing that an existing filter
does that you can do efficiently in userspace.
Kqueue itself (the core code) has only 6 user-settable flags:
    - add/delete,
    - enable/disable (these are optimizations)
    - oneshot/clear  (your new "tristate" flags).
Other than 'enable/disable', epoll is going to have to support these
in one form or another. Everything else is per-filter, and yes, if a
filter is not being used, there is *zero* cost, other than being linked
into the kernel.  And yes, before you ask, I support dynamically loaded
filters, which futher extend kqueue's capabilities.
E.g.: do you want to perform multiple accept()s on a listening socket,
register the descriptors with kqueue, then return all of the new fd's
to userspace, all in one system call?  Trivial, and actually being used
in a commercial product.  Yes, *this* functionality can be done in userspace,
but at the cost of multiple system calls; which is one reason why it is
not part of a stock FreeBSD system.
So, where's the bloat?  The "bloat" apparently comes from the fact
that kqueue is able to do much more than just "POLLIN|POLLOUT".
I don't intend to get into a long argument with you.  It's clear to me 
that epoll is designed to only solve a limited subset of problems that
kqueue does, which is fine.  However, I do object when you say that kqueue
is has "too many flags", or is "bloated".  That's like saying that the 
linux kernel is bloated because it supports XXX different sound modules;
not all users will use all modules nor all features of a single module.
