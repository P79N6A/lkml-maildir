It would be even better if we could poke holes in metadata, etc, but 
this gives us a reasonable test case.

Vladimir extended debugreiserfs to do an optimized reverse mapping scan 
of the disk sector to file/metadata/etc. Definitely worth having that 
ability for any file system.
We also do drive scrubbing, looking for bad sectors. The list of those 
sectors is fed into the reverse mapping code to enable us to gage the 
impact of the IO errors, start recovering the user files, etc.
The scrub code we use takes advantage of the read-verify command (to 
avoid data transfer from the drive to the page cache).
