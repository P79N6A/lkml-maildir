Subject: [RFC] delayed allocation for ext4

Good day,
probably the previous set of patches (including mballoc/lg)
is too large. so, I reworked delayed allocation a bit so
that it can be used on top of regular balloc, though it
still can be used with extents-enabled files only.
this time series contains just 3 patches:
 - booked-page-flag.patch
   adds PG_booked bit to page->flags. it's used in delayed
   allocation to mark space is already reserved for page
   (including possible metadata)
 - ext4-block-reservation.patch
   this is scalable free space management. every time we
   delay allocation of some page, a space (including metadata)
   should be reserved
 - ext4-delayed-allocation.patch
   delayed allocation itself, enabled by "delalloc" mount option.
   extents support is also required. currently it works only
   with blocksize=pagesize.
all the patches can be used in 
ftp://ftp.clusterfs.com/pub/people/alex/2.6.20-rc1/
the series passed basic tests like dd/dbench/fsx.
any comments/questions are very welcome.
thanks, Alex
