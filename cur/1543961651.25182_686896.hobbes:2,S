Not in general no.  Frequently you can get at the registers that
will enable/disable an SMI but that is chipset specific.
Think of SMM mode is a lightweight hypervisor that we can't get rid
of, if you want to understand the worst case.
In theory SMM mode is completely unnecessary as soon as we enable
ACPI.  In practice ACPI appears to frequently trap into SMM mode.
