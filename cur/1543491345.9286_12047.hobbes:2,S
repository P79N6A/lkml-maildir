I am trying to use RH5.2 with an Adaptec 2940UW with one dirve attached
and an Adaptec 2944WD with 2 drives attached. My bios loads the UW
controller first which has NT installed on the UW drive but when I try
to install Linux it seems to be looking at the WD controller first. In
disk druid the 2 drives on the WD controller are assigned sda & sdb and
the UW drive is sdc. I ran across something during the install that said
to use LILO it must be installed on either sda or sdb. That being said,
if I finish the install and reboot, I get the NT loader and never see
LILO since LILO won't install itself on to the same physical disk as NT.
My question then, is how can I get this to work without moving the WD
controller to another machine?
Thanks,
Dave
