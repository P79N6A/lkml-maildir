So what do I do to get it to work?
I could patch glibc so that it treats the -1/4294967295 as a special
case, but...
(I actually did this, but updating /lib/libc.so on a running system
turned out to be a really, Really, REALLY bad idea :-(( ).
Before ruining my machine it worked by prepending LD_LIBRARY_PATH to
the test program, so the idea works.
