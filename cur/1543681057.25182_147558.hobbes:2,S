Hi Con,
I am currently testing SCHED_ISO, but I have noticed a regression:
I do a make -j5 in linux-2.5.75/ everything is OK since gcc prio is 25.
X and fvwm prio are 15, but when I move a window it's very jerky.
And btw, as I am interested in scheduler improvements, do you have a testcase
where the stock scheduler does the bad thing? Preferably without KDE nor
Mozilla (I don't have them installed, and I'll have access to a decent
connection in september).
BTW2, you all seem to test interactivity with xmms. Just for those like me
that didn't noticed, I have just found that it skips much less with alsa's
OSS emulation than with alsa-xmms.
Thanks,
Guillaume
