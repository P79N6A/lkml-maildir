Hi,
my friend bought usb flash disk VMAX/USB2.0/0404 version.
Under WinXP it works, but not under Linux.
There is 1 vfat filesystem, but linux reports 4 and when I try mount one, 
kernel goes to deadlock. System reports bad size too.
Tested 2.4.26, 2.6.6
Here is output:
SCSI subsystem initialized
Initializing USB Mass Storage driver...
scsi0 : SCSI emulation for USB Mass Storage devices
