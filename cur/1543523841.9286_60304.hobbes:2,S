Subject: [RFC] new arch specific hook for "cpu enters lazy tlb mode"
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2000/1/28/122

The current i386 tlb code contains a potential race:
there's a window between switch_mm() and switch_to() where "current"
still points to the old thread, but the cr3 (ie. the page tables)
already point to the new thread.
This means that if the events below happen, then the kernel could
"forget" to send tlb flush IPI's.
I'd propose a new hook in the main scheduler, do you have a better idea
how to fix the problem?
linux/kernel/sched.c:
>             struct mm_struct *mm = next->mm;
>                 struct mm_struct *oldmm = prev->active_mm;
>                 if (!mm) {
>                         if (next->active_mm) BUG();
>                         next->active_mm = oldmm;
>                         atomic_inc(&oldmm->mm_count);
> +			  enter_lazy_mm(oldmm, next, this_cpu);
>                 } else {
>                         if (next->active_mm != mm) BUG();
>                         switch_mm(oldmm, mm, next, this_cpu);
>                 }
> 
>                 if (!prev->mm) {
>                         prev->active_mm = NULL;
>                         mmdrop(oldmm);
>                 }
And here's the problem:
CPU0:                   CPU1
[user program]
                        [page stealer]
switch_mm()
* changes %cr3
* sets bit0 in "next_mm->cpu_vm_mask"
                        flush_tlb_page()
                        * resets "tsk->cpu_vm_mask" to 0.
                        * sends an IPI to all cpu's.
* the IPI arrives, but "current" still points to the old thread.
  Therefore IPI doesn't update "next_mm->cpu_vm_mask", instead
  it updates "oldmm->cpu_vm_mask" [wrong, but harmless]
* switch_to() changes current.
* the cpu returns to user space.
                        flush_tlb_page()
                        * "tsk->cpu_vm_mask" is zero
                          (at least bit0 is zero)
                          no IPI.
                        * cpu0 is not flushed
* the cpu could use outdated tlb entries.
