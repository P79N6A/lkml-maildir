Hmm yes, this is a RAID0 configuration, so the regression of time 
slieced CFQ might me related to it, but the problem of unresponsiveness 
while writing as such was on my single disk, as well. Here one HD is 
SATA (libata silicon image) and one on IDE controller (nforce2). No TCQ. 
BTW, I haven't checked the problem on my ide disk only on SATA. Wil try 
to free some space and do so...
