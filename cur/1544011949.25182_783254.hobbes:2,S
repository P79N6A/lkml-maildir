Subject: [PATCH 01/18] major.h: char-major number for OSD device driver
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/22/71

We need a major for a char device for our OSD device driver.
Attached is a proposed patch for the Documentation/devices.txt
and include/linux/major.h files.
I have allocated the *260* char device as it looked like the next
available on the lanana.org web-site
(
http://lanana.org/docs/device-list/devices-2.6
+.txt)
Any number will do. Please allocate a number for us
(See http:/open-osd.org for further information)
