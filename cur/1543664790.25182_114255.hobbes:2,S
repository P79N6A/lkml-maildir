You are right!  Upgrading to XFree86-4.2.99.902-20030220.1 from RawHide
has fixed the problem.  The only relevant messages in the kernel log are:
[drm] AGP 0.99 on Intel i810 @ 0xd0000000 64MB
[drm] Initialized i810 1.2.1 20020211 on minor 0
mtrr: base(0xd0000000) is not aligned on a size(0x180000) boundary
PCI: Found IRQ 12 for device 00:01.0
and they are printed only once.  The last two are repeated when X
restarts.
I forgot to write in the previous message that CONFIG_DRM_I810_XFREE_41
makes no difference.
