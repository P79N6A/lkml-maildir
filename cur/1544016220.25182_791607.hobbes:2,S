It is up to the user to decide, using oom_adj scores as influence, how to 
define when a task should be selected by the oom killer.  Your 
name-parsing hack can do that for a single global task, but oom_adj scores 
are actually much more powerful.

We finely tune oom_adj scores so that we get the desired results, yes.  
What you're complaining about here is purely a documentation issue.

Again, your patch _completely_ breaks cpuset oom killing.  That is a 
completely separate issue than the memory controller, and it's 
disappointing you still don't see it.
In a cpuset constrained oom condition, we do not explicitly exclude all 
tasks that are in a disjoint, exclusive cpuset since it's quite possible 
that a task has allocated memory outside its cpuset (either because its 
cpuset assignment has changed or because its cpuset's mems has changed) 
and killing it would free memory in current's cpuset.  We do, however, 
prefer to kill a task within the same cpuset; that preference is 
implemented in the badness() scoring.
If a task exists on the system in a disjoint, exclusive cpuset that 
matches oom_victim_name, your patch will cause it to be killed even though 
badness() has penalized it for not sharing a cpuset (dividing its score by 
eight).  That probably needlessly killed oom_victim_name since it won't 
allow for future memory freeing in the oom-triggering cpuset and the 
original oom condition persists.
Now if the parent of that task or another system task forks 
oom_victim_name again, the same thing will happen on the next iteration of 
the oom killer.  This will not free any memory in current's cpuset and it 
will effectively be livelocked.
