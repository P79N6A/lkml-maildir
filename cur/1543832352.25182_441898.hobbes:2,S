uswsusp is probably going to be used for SUSE10.2, so it will have to
be solid at that point. And SUSE10.2 is going to be
end-of-2006/early-2007, IIRC.

Can I get proper bug report?

Suspend2 does not have all the features uswsusp has, and uswsusp does
not have all the features suspend2 has.
If you really miss some feature in uswsusp, please help us with
coding...
