Has anyone been able to get the mmap example from Stevens APUE to work
under Linux? I've used search engines but found nothing of use. Here is
the code snippet:
    if ((fd = open("/dev/zero", O_RDWR)) == -1) {
        perror("open of /dev/zero failed");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    a = mmap (0, 8192, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED | MAP_FILE, fd, 0);
a always returns as -1 and errno is 22 (EINVAL). I've changed all the
EINVAL's to EINVAL+n (n is a constant not a variable) I've replaced n by
1 - 22 in the mm directory and the above code still returns -1/EINVAL.
Why?
