Subject: 2.4 SCSI bug fix tree open
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Several people have complained that 2.4 SCSI bug fixes are getting lost,
so I've opened a bitkeeper tree at
http://linux-scsi.bkbits.net/scsi-misc-2.4
to hold them.
Patches going into this tree should be small, well documented bug fixes
to the current SCSI code (i.e. not driver updates, just bug fixes).
If you want a patch to go in, send it to linux-scsi@vger.kernel.org with
a description of the problem and the fix.
