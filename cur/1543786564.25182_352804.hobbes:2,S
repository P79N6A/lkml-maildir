Exactly - the point is: is it legal to call copy_from_user() while holding a 
spinlock (which is my original question)? Or should copy_from_user try to 
satisfy the fault, instead of seeing in_atomic() or something similar and 
fail?
From what you say, copy_*_user is called in such a way, but it's 
deadlock-prone, when CONFIG_PREEMPT is disabled.

No, it doesn't. But for that case, we're in the same situation as i386.
Consider even that while UML doesn't implement PREEMPT (but we'll fix that, 
sooner or later) it does implement HIGHMEM, and answering to your original 
question:

Apart that anybody would make sure that atomic kmaps are indeed atomic, UML 
doesn't use a "similar implementation" - it verbatim symlinks the i386 file 
and builds it (see arch/um/sys-i386/Makefile and 
arch/um/scripts/Makefile.rules if you want).
Hmm, that's something worth considering... at least when debugging is enabled, 
for debugging purposes.

Ok, that's enough I guess (and I just read what Linus said).
