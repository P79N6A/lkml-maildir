Okay, so now you have to modify ls, cp, tar, and thousands of other applications 
to be aware of the versioning, otherwise you can't use it.
Please don't get hung up on the interface.  This is a really cool feature that 
will require some serious engineering work to make it work right.  There's no 
need to reinvent hidden files as well, since we already have a decades-old 
standard for that.
