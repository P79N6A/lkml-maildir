   Ted Ts'o did a paper on this for Linux Expo 99; if you have the
   Proceedings it's pages 241 to 252.  Unfortunately I don't see a URL on
   there for an online version of the paper.
You can get the paper at:

http://web.mit.edu/tytso/www/linux/stand-device.pdf
Unfortnately the pdf file didn't come out all that profesionally, so
I've included the postscript file as well.
