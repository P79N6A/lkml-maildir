We're sending the scsi ordered queue tag command, which the spec
says will be written after anything already received by the target,
and before anything it receives later on.  I have no data
at all how well the drives follow the spec ;-)
The IDE changes issue cache flushes before the barrier write,
and then another flush after it, which gives us similar semantics.

Controllers that do write back caching should be helped by the reiserfs 
usage changes.  If we pretend they immediately tell the OS a write is 
completed, unpatched reiserfs does this:
write X log blocks
wait on X log blocks (all already complete, so just a CPU loop)
write 1 commit
wait on 1 commit.
With the new code, the controller is more likely to get the commit in 
time to merge the requests.  Hopefully someone who knows more about scsi 
can correct me, but I think the write back controller can ignore the 
ordering rules (since battery backup should promise the request does hit 
media eventually).
I think write through caches should be helped too, as long as they
are smart about how they do the write ordering.  My scsi drive doesn't
seem to be very smart at all, it has been hard to find usage patterns
that show improvement.  So far, only O_SYNC writes really show it.
I think that's what you were asking, sorry if I misunderstood the Q.
