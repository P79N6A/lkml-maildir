Oops, yes, agreed.
I don't see a way (using: make ARCH=powerpc iseries_defconfig,
which wants to enable VIOCONS) to prevent VT from being enabled

However, since VIOCONS is marked (Obsolete) and since the powerpc
people don't comment on this patch & problem, maybe Judith is the
only person who cares.
