I can say, that nulls in files are most common at the end of (sys)log files
filing up to the next block boundary. I always asumed this is due to the
fact that the filesize in the metadata was not written but the last
half-finished block was already linked in the inode structure.
I have never seen null  filled data or config files other than that, but I
do not have busy servers crashing often on me.

Yes, and it is normally easy to spot, since the messages after the nulls are
boot messages.

ls -s compared with ls -l should make that visible?
