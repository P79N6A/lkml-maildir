especially when you start considering size and cost requirements ide looks
particularly attractive.
75GB scsi disks are 11 platter (ibm) or 12 (seagate)  half height drives
vs the 75gxp ide (ibm) with has five platters and is 1" high. The 75GB
scsi disks are around $1500ea vs the ide which are around $550. so if
you're requirements are lots of disk space you can do ide in about 1/2 the
physical space and for about 1/3 the cost of a similar scsi
implementation, at this time.  there are of course still good reasons to
go with scsi for various applications, but raw space alone probably isn't
one of them.
we're bringing up two 675GB stripes shortly to augment an existing 160GB
stripe we have.
