After careful code-review (yeah right... rgrep is my friend), I've come to
the conclusion that do_sd isn't used anywhere. Is there any compelling
reason to leave it in the kernel?
It causes a warning when compiling (not that it buggers me that much,
but, I feel it's unnecessary to have a warning when we don't need to.)
