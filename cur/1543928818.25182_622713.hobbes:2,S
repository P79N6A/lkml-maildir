Two comments:
1) Does it ever make any sense to clone the IPC namespace *without* doing
so also for the MQ namespace or vice versa ?  Unless there is a good
reason for doing so, a single CLONE_IPCMQ flag would suffice.
2) Before coming up with a new clone2() or other solution, what about the
proposed (and debated) sys_indrect() -- if it gets merged it can provide
the solution.
