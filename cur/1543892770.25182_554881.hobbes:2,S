Subject: [patch 17/54] ieee1394: eth1394: bring back a parent device
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
---------------------
From: Stefan Richter <stefanr@s5r6.in-berlin.de>
This adds a real parent device to eth1394's ethX device like in Linux
2.6.20 and older.  However, due to unfinished conversion of the ieee1394
away from class_device, we now refer to the FireWire controller's PCI
device as the parent, not to the ieee1394 driver's fw-host device.
Having a real parent device instead of a virtual one allows udev scripts
to distinguish eth1394 interfaces from networking bridges, bondings and
the likes.
Fixes a regression since 2.6.21:
