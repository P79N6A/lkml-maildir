I are right. I'll add spinlocks. :)

Ok. I see. I'll study the problem but I think this is can be done
later, now I think is better having a working code. :)

This is because is not always true that a PPS source is connected with
a char (or other) device. People whose designed RFC didn't think about
systems where the PPS signal is connected with a CPU's GPIO and the
O.S. doesn't provide any char device to refere with!
In the common desktop PCs the GPS antenna is connected with the serial
line and the PPS source is attached to the serial CD, but in the
embedded systems this is _not_ true. GPS antennae may still be
connected with serial line but the PPS signal is usually connected
with a GPIO pin.
In this scenario you cannot use the serial file descriptor to manage
the PPS signal since it cannot goes to the serial port.

I used pseudo-ioctl interface since it allows me to easily extend PPS
support with special, and uncommon, commands.

This is just the reason why I added those functions. :)

If your GPS antenna is connected with a CPU's GPIO you have _no_
in-kernel client subsystem that creates a PPS source.

As above, if your GPS antenna is connected with a CPU's GPIO you have
_no_ device to open at all, that's why you need at least a function
like pps_findsource().
Note that in this case the pps_info.path is void. Please, see the
special client drivers/pps/clients/ktimer.c, it emulates the case
where you have no /dev/XXX to open(2). If your modifications resolve
the problems to manage the ktimer client you are going in the right
direction.

Ditto.

Unluckily the RFC does _not_ take into account PPS sources connected
with CPU's GPIO... in this case, in fact, you have _no_ char/block
device to open().

Ok, I see, but I think this should be done when everithing is ok. I
think after fixing locking issue I can do it, can't I?
