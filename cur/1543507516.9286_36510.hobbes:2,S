Hi!
I used kde to play the file when a message box opens.
Also I use wavplay.cc which I wrote myself.
It calls 
sound = open("/dev/dsp", O_RDWR); 
status = ioctl(sound, SOUND_PCM_WRITE_BITS, &arg);         /*
Bits/sample */
status = ioctl(sound,SOUND_PCM_WRITE_CHANNELS, &arg); /* channels */
status=ioctl(sound,SOUND_PCM_WRITE_RATE, &arg);  /* samplingrate */
Then data is written to the device. 
The sound is awful on /dev/dsp. It is good on /dev/dsp1.
The file was:

Greetings, Michael
