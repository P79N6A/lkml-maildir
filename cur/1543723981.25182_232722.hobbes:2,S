That goes right up there with, um nope.  The only reason why the
compiler doesn't error about it is because it's not an error.  Doesn't
mean it's right.

Um, actually "char" like "int" and "long" in C99 is signed.  So while
you can write 
signed int x = -3;
You don't have to.  in fact if you "have" to then your compiler is
broken.  Now I know that GCC offers "unsigned chars" but that's an
EXTENSION not part of the actual standard.  
You ought to distinguish "what my compiler does" with "what the
standard actually says".  If you want unsigned chars don't be lazy,
just write "unsigned char".  
As for writing portable code, um, jacka#!, BitKeeper, you know, that
thingy that hosts the Linux kernel?  Yeah it uses LibTomCrypt.  Why not
goto 
http://libtomcrypt.org
 and find out who the author is.  Oh yeah,
that would be me.  Why not email Wayne Scott [who has code in
LibTomCrypt btw...] and ask him about it?
Who elses uses LibTomCrypt?  Oh yeah, Sony, Gracenote, IBM [um Joy
Latten can chip in about that], Intel, various schools including
Harvard, Stanford, MIT, BYU, ...
I write code that builds on basically any box with GCC which includes
regular PCs, Macs, Gameboys, PS2, Suns, etc, etc, etc.  All without
changes....
