One more tidbit: ISO/IEC 9899:1990 3.14
  3.14 object: A region of data storage in the execution environment,
    the contents of which can represent values.  Except for
    bit-fields, objects are composed of contiguous sequences of one or
    more bytes, the number, order and encoding of which are either
    explicitely specified or implementation-defined.
This would specifically prohibit separating any part of a structure
from the rest.
