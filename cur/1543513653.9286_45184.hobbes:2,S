It is crap. For the following reasons:
- you can filter on the Sender: owner-linux-kernel@... header
- using your scheme you'll filter the message wrongly when a
  message is being cross-posted to multiple lists.
For example, this is your filter:
	[linux-kernel] --> put in linux-kernel
	[linux-smp] --> put in linux-smp
Now a reply from linux-kernel to both lists has both mails
ending up in linux-kernel, because that one is caught first.
Another argument against is that [linux-kernel] takes away
14 characters from the subject field in my mail reader. This
is simply unacceptable (and completely unnecessary).
