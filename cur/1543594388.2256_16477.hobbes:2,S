From the part of the dmesg log you quoted I conclude that
(a) the NMI watchdog didn't kill you (good), but
(b) the calibration loop detects a 0MHz bus speed and then fails
    to produce the "CPU0:<T0: ...>" line, which means it hangs in
    arch/i386/kernel/apic.c:setup_APIC_timer(), probably because
    apic_read(APIC_TMCCT) always returns zero.
Anyway, you should disable CONFIG_X86_UP_APIC on your P4 for now.
You won't lose any performance due to this, only the possibility to
use the NMI watchdog.
