/me has no intention of cooling down the optimization phase
Good thing there are lots of other developers, huh?

This is an optimization issue.

That's true.  Usually, X by itself starts pretty fast.  Just try 'xinit', no 
parameters.  KDE and Gnome both need to go on a diet, especially KDE.  They 
both need to open files less often on startup, in particular they should 
avoid opening the same file zillions of times.  Though we have kernel 
optimizations for that it's still sloppy and a bad idea.

Optimization again.  Wait for it, fundamental changes are taking place in the 
Linux filesystem world.

It's been worked on.  Google: two kernel monte
Hmm, for someone who thinks we should cool down on optimization, you sure 
have a lot of optimizations on your wish list.
