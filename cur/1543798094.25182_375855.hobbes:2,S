atomic_cmpxchg should be available on all platforms.
While it may be strictly unnecessary, if it can be used to avoid
having a crappy default implementation that requires it to be
reimplemented in all architectures then that would be a good thing.
Any arguments about bad scalability or RT behaviour of the hashed
spinlock emulation atomic_t implementations are silly because they
are used by all atomic_ operations. It is an arch implementation
detail that generic code should not have to worry about.
