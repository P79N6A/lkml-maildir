Subject: scripts/namespace.pl is not CROSS_COMPILE happy

All,
    I see that this has come up before:
    
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/9/20/68
but I don't see the inclusion of these changes in the current Linus
linux-2.6 git tree. Are the changes hanging out somewhere or were they
shot down for some reason?
    I've attached an alternate patch which is a ever so slightly more
clean (for some definitions of "clean").

P.S. Please CC me, I'm not on the list.
