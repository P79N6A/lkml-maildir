Right, the definitions for how to get the dma_mask out of a bus specific
device don't belong into the generic header file.
Still, each host driver knows how to find the dma_mask if any, so
it can easily set the field in the Scsi_Host. Existing pci host
adapter drivers can keep using scsi_set_pci_device(), others
can just as well do it themselves.
