Probably: BIOS booting, messing with computer cases (are the computers
in locked room and only kbds/monitors/mouses are accessible?), sniffing
keyboard cables (all other passwords if not root's), physical damage
to the computer hardware (some kind of DoS).
Still, may be adequate for student room.

With correct timing, possibly. Depends on how the graphics driver starts
and switches from text mode. There might be noticeable differences.

I think Xserver could terminate gracefully. But it would require changes
to kernel SAK handling I think - not sure if it's worth it, given other
threats.
Another idea: if the machines are ACPI-enabled and have "soft-power"
buttons, one can make use of acpid.
