Is this true even if you don't write through those old mappings?
Is DRM or AGP then not also broken with lazy highmem flushing, or
how do they solve that?

Definitely.

I've been thinking that a simple debug mode could be a good idea.
Have a new field in the struct page to count the number of possible
unflushed mappings to the page so that things like PAT could go
BUG_ON appropriate conditions. Would that be helpful?
