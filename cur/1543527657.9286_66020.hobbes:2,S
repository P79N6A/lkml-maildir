Hi Mike, Alan.
ALAN: I'm not quite sure about the ease with which the jiffies
interval can be changed in current kernels. Memory says you're
reasonably au fait with that, so can you advise on the current
state of play please?

When you press any of the other keys, does it also print the
exact same time for both events?

Is that just for the SYSRQ key, or for any key?

That's to be expected.

True.

Are you sure?
Remember, all you need is to be able to distinguish between a
keypress that sends both make and break codes together (which is
wrong) and one that sends the codes as the event in question
occurs (which is right).
In your description above, you refer only to what happens when
you press the SYSRQ key, and before you can make this claim, you
need to know whether the same is true of the other keys as well.
As a quick data point, let's look at professional touch typists.
Their typing speed is measured in "words per minute" where a word
is defined as being six key presses. I believe the world record
is around 300 words per minute, but let's be generous and work
out what a typing speed of 450 words per minute would correspond
to. That's about 50% faster than the record.
We have...
   (6 keypresses per word) * (450 words per minute)     2700
   ------------------------------------------------  =  ----
             (60 seconds per minute)                     60
...which, by my maths, comes out at 45 keys per second, or 90 key
make codes and key break codes combined per second. This is in
agreement with the claim that to convert words per minute to keys
per second, one simply divides the former by 10.
Now, it's a basic rule of physics that to ensure that one samples
an event fast enough to get a true picture of what's happenning,
one needs to sample at least twice as fast as the speed at which
the thing one is measuring is occurring. Therefore, a keyboard
capable of keeping up with this is sampling the key states at
least twice as often as that, and is thus able to send codes out
at 180 codes per second.
You would therefore need a counter that can distinguish between
the arrival times of codes arriving at 180 codes per second to be
able to time every gap.
 > So, I need an existing in kernel counter that is a bit
 > faster.
Based on the above maths, you would need a counter that measures
time units of 1/200 of a second or shorter to be able to measure
the arrival times for all keys.
 > Jiffies are 1/100 of a second on x86 if I'm correct, so

The DEFAULT on an x86 is 1/100 of a second, but I understand that
can be changed by simply changing a single #define in the
sources, I have certainly heard of people running Linux on x86
with it set to use jiffies of 1/1024 second, which is the value
used on the Alpha if my memory's correct.
Personally, I could see good reason for changing that counter to
enable a working fix to be produced where one can't be produced
otherwise, PROVIDING that it doesn't adversely affect the kernel
in other ways.

Based on simple maths, the 1/100 jiffies counter should be able
to distinguish the two cases for typists with speeds of 250 wpm
or below, and for the usual case of speeds below 150 wpm, should
have no problem whatsoever.

I can't answer that question, sorry.

Are you sure of that? Remember that just because your broken
keyboard only shows one key with the problem doesn't mean that
there aren't other keyboards that show the same problem for more
than one key, or for other keys - and a solution that solves this
problem for ALL keys is more likely to get in than one that only
solves this problem for one specific key, no matter how important
that key may be.

You appear to have completely missed the point: Whatever your
patch is for, if it can also be used to solve other problems,
then it WILL be used to solve them. In fact, it would almost
certainly be to your advantage to write it such that it DOES
solve related problems at the same time.

There is one problem with that scenario: WHat happens if the user
tries to press ALT-SCRLK and hits the SYSRQ key whilst doing so?
On a correctly working keyboard, the code sequence that would
be presented to the kernel is...
	ALT MAKE
	SYSRQ MAKE
	SYSRQ BREAK
	SCRLK MAKE
	SCRLK BREAK
	ALT BREAK
...and EXACTLY THE SAME sequence would show up on your broken
keyboard, but the sequence that your patch would present to the
kernel is DIFFERENT, namely...
	ALT MAKE
	SYSRQ MAKE
	SCRLK MAKE
	SCRLK BREAK
	ALT BREAK
	SYSRQ BREAK
...and this needs dealing with before your patch works.
One solution would be to define the sequence SYSRQ SCRLK as being
identical to pressing SCRLK on its own, but that's for you to
decide.

If the solution is specific to just that one key, then yes, it
would almost certainly be rejected. However, a solution that
solved a more generic problem relating to ANY shift key on the
keyboard would have a far better chance of getting in.

Even then, it may get rejected as being code bloat - and you
would almost certainly need to include a new config option after
the "Enable SYSRQ" option such that the following appeared in
"make menuconfig" in the "Kernel hacking" screen...
	[*] Magic SysRq key
	[*]    Fix keyboards with broken SysRq behaviour
...as otherwise, you'd almost certainly have the anti-bloat
brigade up in arms at the way you've "bloated the kernel to deal
with a problem they don't have" as they usually claim.

As stated previously, you don't actually need to time the event,
but only to detect whether the make/break codes have come too
fast. A similar problem occurs with the automatic decoding of
morse code, and there's a tried and trusted solution in regular
use for which a variation could be used here:
 1. Determine the average rate at which make or break events
    occur, and set TIMEOUT to 2/3 of this value.
 2. Declare any occasion where the interval is less than
    TIMEOUT units as being broken.
Note that this method is not based on the times for the broken
key (which is what you appear to be using), but on the times for
the keys that work fine (which makes much more sense to me).

If you're insisting on basing your method on the timings of
broken keys, then yes, it will be infeasible to measure the times
by definition: the broken keyboard is sending the codes one after
the other as fast as it can.
Try developing a method based instead on the non-broken keyboard
and you should be able to develop one that can handle typists
with a speed of up to 120 wpm with ease.
Come to think of it, ALT-SYSRQ is neither a standard keypress for
a typist nor one that's easy to press, so you will probably find
that for that specific case, the above method would handle any
typist one threw at the keyboard for that particular combination.

Linus has recently expressed his dislike of the use of /proc
files for changing kernel behaviour, so I would tend to suspect
that he would reject any solution incorporating this.

It's not a global variable in most cases, but one specific to the
particular file you use. It's also not difficult to do.
