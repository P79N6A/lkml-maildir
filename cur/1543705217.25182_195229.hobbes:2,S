This is an strace bug.  Because of goofy ptrace interactions, strace does
funny business with threads doing wait calls.  strace should resume those
threads when the pids they are waiting for exit.  
Make sure you are using the most current strace and if it's still not
different then report the strace bug (<strace-devel@lists.sourceforge.net>
or 
https://bugzilla.redhat.com
 are fine).
  
To research the issue thoroughly, you may have to avoid relying on strace
to tell you what calls your programs make.
