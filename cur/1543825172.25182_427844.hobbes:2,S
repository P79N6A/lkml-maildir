Earlier I asked if you had a copy of LDD v3 for a reason, you seemed
to take this as a direct insult or something like that... please take
a look at the LDD chapter on PCI device drivers, see how the
pci_register_driver and struct pci_driver work in order to register
devices, the pci_get_subsys and stuff is old code.
All the important fb drivers use the correct PCI interface.
The DRM uses the incorrect interface in-tree, and in CVS has both.
I really think you've somehow taken things a bit personally, which
might be understandable, but by the standards of some of the flame
wars on this list, this thread is tame in the least...
Dave.
