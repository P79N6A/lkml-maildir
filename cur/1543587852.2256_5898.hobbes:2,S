I'm not a kernel hacker, but I've got some thoughts on this:
1> Modules (with the autoloader) can do that for anything not necessary to
boot. (Although even modules could lose a few pages after they
load/init/etc.  Hardware setup tends to only happen once..)
2> It'd be great for embedded systems.  But you'd need a "scale" -
something along the lines of "Page this out, compress it, step on it,
forget it, we'll never need it in a hurry" up through "page this out if
you -absolutely- have to, but make it easily accessible as fast as
possible".
3> It would involve a major kernel rewrite before it was anything more
than a slowdown to a few drivers supporting it.  And there would probably
need to be some /proc method of forbidding paging on certain
(modules/segments/etc) so that, for example, people who hit the
least-likely-path (most-likely-to-page-out) on a regular basis can disable
paging of that section/module/driver/whatnot.
