Via the writeback_control, hopefully.
For write_one_page(), sync_mode==WB_SYNC_ALL, so NFS should start the I/O
immediately (it appears to not do so).
For vmscan->writepage, wbc->for_reclaim is set, so we know that the IO
should be pushed immediately.  nfs_writepage() seems to dtrt here.
With the proposed changes, we don't need that iput() in nfs_writepage(). 
That worries me because I recall from a couple of years back that there are
really subtle races with doing iput() on the vmscan->writepage() path. 
Cannot remember what they were though...
