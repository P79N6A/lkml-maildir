The fix is to make sure you have a nameserver in your /etc/resolv.conf
The kernel has no idea how to resolve names into addresses. That's a
userspace thing. I'm not sure if you can extract the dhcp info from the
kernel after the boot, otherwise you'll just have to run a userspace
dhcp client, I use dhclient.
