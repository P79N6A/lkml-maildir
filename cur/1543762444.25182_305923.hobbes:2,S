Yes, I have the trace now.  Why is curious.  This is the trace of the
failure:

The problem occurs when the mid-layer rejects the I/O to the dead
device.  Here it returns BLKPREP_KILL to the prep function, but after
that we never get a completion back.
I'll dig around in ll_rw_blk.c to see if I can trace the problem, but
you know this code better than I do ...
