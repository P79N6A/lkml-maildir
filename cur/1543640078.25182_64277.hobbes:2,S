There's gotta be a better place to ask this, but...
Greetings,
Is it possible to change scsi drive sector size?  Scsiinfo says no, which is
inconvenient if you're making images of ancient drives (ST4766N) and find
that some have 512 byte and others 1024 byte sectors.
Why on earth would a manufacturer [drives are really CDC] do this?
