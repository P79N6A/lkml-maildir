In your response, all the people copied on the mail got removed. I am adding
them back.
May be a printk. Not very sure. User can always see in the console messages
list of command line options passed to the kernel.
apic settings are displayed if you pass apic=debug.
Not very sure what do you mean by displaying init level, and init shell
and how that stuff is related to this parameter. 
Thanks
