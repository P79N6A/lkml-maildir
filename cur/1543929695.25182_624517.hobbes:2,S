it's all in the mm branch of x86.git:
 git-clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git linux-2.6.git
 cd linux-2.6.git
 git-branch x86       # (1)
 git-checkout x86
 git-pull git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/x86/linux-2.6-x86.git mm
so the easiest is to do patches just against that tree.
NOTE: the x86.git tree is frequently regenerated, so it can not be 
rolling upgraded the usual git way via typing 'git-pull' - you have to 
zap your x86 branch and re-pull:
 git-checkout master
 git-branch -D x86     # this zaps everything!
and repeat from (1) above.
