No.
$ rpcinfo -u jacquere 100021
rpcinfo: RPC: Timed out
program 100021 version 0 is not available
zsh: exit 1     rpcinfo -u jacquere 100021
So I see now lockd is not present on the client. But...
$ rpcinfo -p jacquere
   program vers proto   port
    100000    2   tcp    111  portmapper
    100000    2   udp    111  portmapper
    100021    1   udp  32768  nlockmgr
    100021    3   udp  32768  nlockmgr
    100021    4   udp  32768  nlockmgr
    100024    1   udp    867  status
    100024    1   tcp    870  status
So what does that mean?

OK, that's good to know.
