Hm, I think we should probably just check in pci_get_device() to verify
that ->next is really valid.  If it isn't just return NULL, as we have
no idea what the next device would possibly be.  The worse thing that
would happen is the proc file would be a bit shorter than expected.  If
read again, it would be correct, with the previously referenced device
now gone.
I don't want to try to hold a lock over start/next/stop as that would
just be asking for trouble :)
Sound acceptable?

Heh, good point, I'll go fix that :)
thanks for looking at this,
