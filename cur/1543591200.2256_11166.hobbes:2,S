I tested 2.4.4-ac9 today on A7V133 machine. It booted up, but can't stand
any load. It will deadlock (without oops) when the network/disk system faces
any load.
There is also some new bug in VIA IDE driver. It misdetects cable as 80-w
when it's only 40-w and causes some CRC errors and speed dropping. Some
older kernels correctly detected the cable as 40-w and used UDMA33, this one
tries to use UDMA100 and fails (of course). Is there any way to force cable
detection to 40-w?
