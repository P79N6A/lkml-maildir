The message is coming from the PCI subsystem. Yes it is triggered by the
pending driver load and requesting card pci resources, but such messages
are usually a result of issues with the Motherboard BIOS or Hardware.
They are not generally a result of the driver or the associated
hardware.
My take (which can be incorrect) on this message is that someone put
just a bit too much debugging into the PCI subsystem :-) and the net
result is that you are firmly knowledgeable about the fact that device
on PCI address 03:0d.0 and 03:09.0 are sharing IRQ 4. The 'info' message
is printed every time the pcibios_enable_device() call is made. The
interrupt sharing is assigned by the Motherboard BIOS and if you have
subsequent problems with the operation of the card(s) or the system, you
should investigate updating the Motherboard BIOS or go into the
motherboard BIOS setup and see if you can reassign the PCI (IRQ)
resources.
The spurious 8259A interrupt message *may* be viewed as a problem.
Sincerely -- Mark Salyzyn

Is this
PCI: Found IRQ 4 for device 03:0d.0
PCI: Sharing IRQ 4 with 03:09.0
repeated kernel message okay for so many times?
