Actually, I think we should do the reverse (for testing), and make the
name be something small like 8 bytes, and make sure that everybody who
writes the name uses strncpy()  and snprintf() instead of just blindly
writing whatever is in the database.
Otherwise we'll always end up having fragile magic constants.
Anybody willing to do that cleanup?
