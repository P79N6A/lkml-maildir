Subject: [patch-2.4.0-test10-pre3] logic of __alloc_pages_limit().
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Hi Linus and Rik,
The same analysis I did for __alloc_pages() applies to
__alloc_pages_limit(), namely it can be optimized by looking at the logic
of 'page == NULL'. In both cases, of course, I checked the assembly
listing to make sure that my patch didn't make a worse code. It was always
a few instructions shorter and therefore worth it. (I didn't check whether
gcc produced fewer branches, I assume he did, otherwise he would be
totally braindead...).
Regards,
Tigran
