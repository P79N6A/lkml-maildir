Hi,
I want the following feature:
Linux would be able (if this is possible for software) to
deliver to the user the state of the HDD, whether it is
active.
I mean that Linux would have a module which would export to
user space a boolean flag (probably a semaphore) which would
be true while the HDD red lamp is shining and false while it
is dark.
That is I want sofrware to provide the same info as this
hadrware HDD indicator on the front panel of most PCs.
(Then a Gnome applet would show it.)
I just look under the table to check HDD status to often
and would instead like to see it on the monitor.
Just a little wish.
