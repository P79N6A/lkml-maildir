Sure.  But the generic_file_aio_write_nolock() code is doing this:
		if (written >= count && !is_sync_kiocb(iocb))
			written = -EIOCBQUEUED;
		if (written < 0 || written >= count)
			goto out_status;
Under what circumstances can `written' (the amount which was written) be
greater than `count' (the amount to write)?
