Heh :-). I'd categorize the lvm fixes as "obviously right", haven't
checked why they seem to break for some people. Maybe the minor indexing
of LVM is broken, in which case attached patch should make it go again
(and the LVM crew needs to look into that). Also fixes a slight error in
the IO error path.
