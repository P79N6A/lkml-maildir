2.6.27-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
From: "Theodore Ts'o" <tytso@mit.edu>
(cherry picked from commit ac51d83705c2a38c71f39cde99708b14e6212a60)
This fixes a 2.6.27 regression which was introduced in commit a02908f1.
We weren't passing the chunk parameter down to the two subections,
ext4_indirect_trans_blocks() and ext4_ext_index_trans_blocks(), with
the result that massively overestimate the amount of credits needed by
ext4_da_writepages, especially in the non-extents case.  This causes
failures especially on /boot partitions, which tend to be small and
non-extent using since GRUB doesn't handle extents.
This patch fixes the bug reported by Joseph Fannin at:
