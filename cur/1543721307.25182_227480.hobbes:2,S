Hi all,
Sorry if this is a completely redundant post but I have not been 
subscribed recently and missed the thread on this.
I have had cdparanoia ripping blank sound off of my cdrom, looking in 
the syslog gives the following just before stuff goes weird.
kernel: cdrom: dropping to single frame dma
Whilst trying to find others with the same problem I have seen an 
archived LKML thread where Jens Axboe provided a patch against 2.6.4-rc1
I am currently running 2.6.5 and am wondering if this patch made it in 
or not, and if not, where I can grab it from.
Alternatively, if this patch should be in 2.6.5 then I have a machine 
that still fails with it, if so I'll be happy to post system specs etc 
and try to find a test CD that exhibits the problem for testing.
Cheers,
   N
