Hi Jari,
Your crypto is good, your language is bad.
Clearly there is no intentional backdoor.
You do not gain any credibility by saying otherwise.
Next, confusing the kernel with util-linux is a strange trick.
Finally, in the time I maintained util-linux I have asked you
I don't know how often to come with a series of small clean
patches instead of a huge ugly all-or-nothing monolithic patch.
But you didnt.
Maybe you don't understand, but it does not suffice when code
is correct - it must also be maintainable.
Something rather similar is true for the kernel, I suspect.
A series of short clean patches would have solved all problems.
As it is, time may be running out - some years ago your stuff
was far superior to everything else. But alternative
approaches are being developed, and maybe loop-aes will soon
be some historic oddity.
