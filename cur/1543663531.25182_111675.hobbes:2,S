Subject: Older bk snapshots not found on www.kernel.org (fwd)

Ave people.
I know www.xx.kernel.org has nice bk snapshots in the form 
of patch-2.5.x-bkx.gz  However,they are only against the latest linus 
release. The problem is I have a 100% repeatable OOPS in 2.5.62 while 
2.5.61 worked.  Before I send in a bug report I want to nail it down to 
which bk snapshot starts failing to make it a little easier for the 
bughunters to find the bug.  Is there any website/ftp whatever which 
collects older bk snapshots?
And if the maintainer of www.kernel.org reads this. May I suggest to keep 
the bk snaphots of let's say the last 4/5 linus releases. Then people like 
me who test the kernel a couple of days after release can start a bug hunt 
and test bk snaphots from the past.
