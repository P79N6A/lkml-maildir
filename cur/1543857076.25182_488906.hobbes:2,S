i disagree that the scheduler unconditionally 'needs' such a facility. 
The scheduler clock is pretty special and has other requirements and 
constraints than generic timekeeping clocks. It /might/ and /could/ 
utilize such an infrastructure, but it's not at all clear that it 
'needs' such a facility.
in any case, i very much entertain the possibility of more synergy in 
this space, but it's far from obvious and it's definitely not 
unconditionally 'necessary'. The scheduler and profiling code certainly 
worked for 15 years without such synergy. What we concentrated on in 
this patchset is high-resolution timers and dynticks, not scheduler or 
profiler clock cleanups. We cleaned up everything that we impacted 
directly, but we also tried to limit the scope of the changes wherever 
possible.
