Argghhh! It's *NOT* sprinkled all over with random hacks which prevent
it from scheduling early. It's a clean design with the absence of
random hacks.
What you're asking for is the *introduction* of random hacks. Not the
reversal of random hacks. Hasn't this been made clear by now?
Is this an attempt at Newspeak or trying to snow people over with FUD?
