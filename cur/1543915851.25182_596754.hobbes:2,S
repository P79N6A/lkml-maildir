I think you're on to something here. If we stored the files with all
the non-meaningful whitespace (including non-meaningful newlines)
removed, not only would we save disk space, but we would also
eliminate significant amounts of developer time and LKML bandwidth
currently expended on arguing about formatting. Everybody could just
run things through indent with whatever formatting they preferred.
Might make diffs ugly, though...
