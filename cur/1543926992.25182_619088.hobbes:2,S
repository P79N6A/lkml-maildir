Yeah, these are mostly bogus and just never got removed. I'll poke
through it and kill them off or fix up the Makefiles to actually use
them (as in the HDSP253_LED case). Thanks for catching these, these sorts
of reports are really useful.
Have you considered tidying up your config checker and adding it as a
static analyser target with the existing set? 'make configcheck' or
something would be a reasonable addition.
