I came into this thread late.  Yesterday I was bit by a corrupted
modversions.h file on a make -j 4.  This is the first time I've ever seen
such a thing.  Are you saying that the potential's been there all along?
Without getting into an off-topic debate about recursive makes, I'm
wondering if there is any reasonable workaround.
