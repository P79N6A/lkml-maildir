Our tester will reopen a tracker of this issue. When it's fired, you
will be updated with this information.

And the docs said the default was not to provide that (in order to use the internal pull-up that most, but not all, SD cards have for detection). Might be something to look at if you haven't already.

I guess it is for MMC/SD card insert detection. Is it related with the
4-bit MMC and 4-bit SD?
Actually, there are some issues about the card insert detection on
BF54x SDH. Following is some comments of our bfin-sdh driver which is
in the development.

/* In term of ADSP_BF54x_Blackfin_Processor_Peripheral_Hardware_Reference,
 * the SDH allows software to detect a card when it is inserted into its slot.
 * The SD_DATA3 pin powers up low due to a special pull-down resistor. When an
 * SD Card is inserted in its slot, the resistance increases and a rising edge
 * is detected by the SDH module.
 * But this doesn't work sometimes. When a MMC/SD card is inserted, the voltage
 * doesn't rise on SD_DATA3. In term of The MultiMediaCard System Specification,
 * SD_DATA3 is used as CS pin in SPI mode. The MultiMediaCard wakes up in the
 * MultiMediaCard mode. During the scan procedure, host will send CMD0 to reset
 * MMC card, if CS pin is low, MMC card will enter SPI mode. Of course Secure
 * Digital Host controller is not a SPI controller. So the Card detect function
 * has to be disabled. After card is inserted run "echo 0 > /proc/driver/sdh"
 * to trigger card scanning */
