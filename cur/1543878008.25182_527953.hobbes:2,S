I know your words now. The entire hid_bus device is useless. The
original code of hid bus is copied from LDD3e. It seem the API had
changed since it pressed. In fact, the new kernel only work silent
without it, or the kref_get() will warn us.
And, I fixed the double hidinput_disconnect() problem last night. It's
reason is not invalid memory access, instead of, it's normal behavior of
hidinput_disconnect(). The resolution is easy, We should move inputs
member to hid_device, not in hid_driver. so if we removed one
hid_device, it do not disconnect all devices which its driver bind, just
only itself.
Now, usbhid works fine.
Good luck.
