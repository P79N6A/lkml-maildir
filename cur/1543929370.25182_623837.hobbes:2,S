But don't forget that OOP is just another way to organize your code,
and let the language/compiler do some things you shouldn't de doing,
like fill an vtable pointer, that are error prone.
And of course everything depends on what language you choose and how
you use it.
You could write an equally effcient kernel in languages like C++,
using C++ abstractions as a high level organization, where
the fast paths could be coded the right way; we are not talking about
C# or Java, where even a sum is a call to an overloaded method.
Its the difference between doing school-book push and pops to lists,
and suddenly inventing the splice operator...
