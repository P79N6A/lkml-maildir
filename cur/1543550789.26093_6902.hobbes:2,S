need help getting tapX devices operational on 2.4
for 2.4 using the new tun.o module I cannot create a tap0
interface.  on 2.2 it is the ethertap.o module.
changing modules.conf allows the module to load but the
interface does not come up:
ifconfig tap0 192.168.0.10 up
SIOCSIFADDR: No such device
tap0: unknown interface: No such device
tap0: unknown interface: No such device
has anyone successfully gotten this to work, if so how?
using devfs, which has created /dev/netlink/tapX devices...
symlinking /dev/netlink/tap0 /dev/tap0 doesn't help.
#define TUN_DEBUG 1, in tun.c doesn't help, fails to compile.
TIA
Martin
