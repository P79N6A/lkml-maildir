Many datasheets are incorrect and don't follow realities of chipset
design evolution. Which is why I started this quest in the first place ;)

Lucky bastard! :)

Thanks a lot!
I'll do a diff on this versus the "non-working"
dumps and have a peek at the VT8235/VT8237 datasheet
to see whether there can something be done about it.
I still don't entirely buy the "different chipset revision"
theory, hopefully I'm correct and it's just another bit to
tweak (but hopefully it's not a "write-only" bit that needs
tweaking...).
BTW, is there any obvious chipset ecosystem difference
in your system? Are any other important PCI IDs/revs
different from mine?
Further working/non-working dumps greatly appreciated!
