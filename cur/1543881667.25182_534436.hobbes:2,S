Subject: old ISA DMA bug in 2.6.12?

I was enjoying yet another session of beating my head against the wall
trying to do useful things with old hardware :-), and managed to cause a
kernel panic by simply trying to mount a cdrom in the context of a DSL-N
installation.
The SCSI host adapter is an Adaptec AHA-1542B, and when I try to mount a
cdrom, I manage to run afoul of the BAD_DMA() check in aha1542.c: the
buffer returned is not in the lower 16 MB of memory.
The same 2.6.12 kernel + hardware combination works fine as long as I
confine my I/O to the hard disk that's also attached to the AHA-1542B.
