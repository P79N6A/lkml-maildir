Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying printk is unusable or horrendously
unstable... I'm just saying that I got bit by it and I'm trying to get a
fix in so other people don't run into similar things in the future.  The
patches I proposed aim to be minimal patches that impact the fewest
subsystems possible and affect performance the least amount
possible.  Within this constraint, I'm trying to make printk _more_ robust
(which is good, because debugging tools get used/misused in the worst
ways) without redesigning the whole system.
