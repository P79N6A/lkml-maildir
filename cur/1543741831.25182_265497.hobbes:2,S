EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL() may only be used for new exported symbols, Linus
has spoken. I believe the phrase involved killer penguins with
chainsaws for anybody who changed existing exported interfaces. 
not sure if this applies or not to the class_simple interfaces,
probably not but just FYI....
there is no reason NV or who ever can't implement their own non-simple
class ....
Dave.
