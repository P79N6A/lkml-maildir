In that case a conversion of a conditional branch to an unconditional 
write to a visible variable is not an acceptable behaviour.  Aside from 
the kernel issues, it would break any number of threaded userspace apps.
As was mentioned elsewhere, it's akin to sprinkling
int j = i; i = j;
throughout the code.  If "i" is accessed by multiple threads, this is 
not allowed unless a lock is held.
