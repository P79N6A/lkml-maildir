Probably pcmcia "ds" driver and CONFIG_PCMCIA_LOAD_CIS.

Equally arguably, we should just have a "resume_late()" call that can be 
used to do this after everything is up and running.
And quite frankly, I don't actually see any reason why firmware loading 
shouldn't work in the resume path. I really do think that this is ANOTHER 
bug that has no other reason than the fact that that f*cking freezer 
killed the system for no really good reason.
