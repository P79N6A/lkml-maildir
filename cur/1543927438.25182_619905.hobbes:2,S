But you wouldn't actually *use* this address space.  It's just for the 
linker to know what address to tag the references with; it gets 
relocated by gs_base down into proper kernel space.  The linker can 
stash the initialized reference copy at any address (LMA) which can be 
different from what it will be used at (VMA); that is not an issue.
To use %rip references, though, which are more efficient, you probably 
want to use offsets that are just below .text (at -2 GB); presumably
-2 GB-[max size of percpu section].  Again, however, no CPU actually 
needs to have its data stashed in that particular location; it's just an 
offset.
