Yup, the new tcp code in pre10 didn't fix it - system crashed after about
25 hours:
[1.] One line summary of the problem:
Hard crashes of system related to tcp_keepalive
[2.] Full description of the problem/report:
The following frozen screen occurring between once a week and once a
day (with only the most minor differences, has appeared running kernels
1.2.13, 1.2.14 and now 1.2.15pre9 and pre10, through replacement of the
memory, motherboard, CPU, brand of NICs, video card, and drive cables
(what's constant now is the Tekram DC-390F SCSI controller, the IBM SCSI
HD, a Western Digital IDE HD used for /boot and swap, and the case and
power supply):
[3.] Keywords (i.e., modules, networking, kernel):
tcp_keepalive crash
[4.] Kernel version (from /proc/version):
Linux version 2.2.15pre10 (root@china.patternbook.com) (gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release)) #1 Fri Feb 25 08:5

Aiee, killing interrupt handler
Kernel panic: Attemted to kill the idle task:
In swapper task - not syncing
[6.] A small shell script or example program which triggers the
problem (if possible)
Not a clue. Happens at different times of day, in different load
conditions - more common though when masqueraded systems are not on.

Chip sym53c875E, device id 0xf, revision id 0x26
IO port address 0xc000, IRQ number 5
Using memory mapped IO at virtual address 0xc4000000
Synchronous period factor 12, max commands per lun 32
[7.5.] Other information that might be relevant to the problem
(please look in /proc and include all information that you
think to be relevant):
The system is a DSL connected firewall (connected to SpeedStream bridge
to Covad to AT&T ATM) with masquerading for two other systems (although it
fails whether they are active or off), running DNS (bind 8.2.2 5), Apache,
Proftpd, sendmail, MySQL.
[X.] Other notes, patches, fixes, workarounds:
Didn't tcp_keepalive used to be a compile-time option in the kernel? What
would I do to compile a current kernel without this 'feature'? Would I
miss it? This is a production system that I can't man  24x7, so any
kludged fix is preferable to continuing to have to check it constantly to
stay up.
