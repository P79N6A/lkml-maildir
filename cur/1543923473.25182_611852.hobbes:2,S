Hi Jens,
The following patches correct some issues with the deadline I/O
scheduler and its batching algorithm.
Patch 1 is a simple function factorisation.
Patch 2 fixes a missing batch count reset, making the behaviour
  closer to that implied by the documentation.
Patch 3 changes batch start points to resolve a disparity in
  latency and bandwidth between high- and low-sector requests.
Thanks,
-- Aaron
