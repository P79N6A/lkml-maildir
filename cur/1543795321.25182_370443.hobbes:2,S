Thanks.
BTW can you point me to a good explanation of DRM locking?  There's so
much indirection in the DRM code I can't even tell whether there's one
DRM lock or several, what kind of lock it is or what it's protecting
(beyond "access to the hardware").  Is it just an advisory lock used by
DRM clients to keep from stepping on each other?  It doesn't seem
related to spinlocks or mutexes or any of the other types of lock in the
kernel.
