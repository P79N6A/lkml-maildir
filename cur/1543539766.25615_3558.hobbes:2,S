If Linux (the kernel) does so, it is certainly a bug which must be fixed
ASAP. If a userland program provided by Western Digital, Seagate, IBM or
whatnot does so, it isn't Linux's fault.
If you go by your interpretation, _no_ OS can ever be able to comply, as
they just can't ever prevent somebody writing a proggie that (given access)
bangs whatever garbage it wants at whatever piece of hardware it wants to.
