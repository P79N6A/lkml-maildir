If you mean debug=1 enabled, the log excerpt I posted was generated with
both the usbserial and visor modules modprobed with debug=1. Perhaps I am
mistaken in assuming that my approach actually enables debugging. I
modprobed both modules and hit the hotsync button. I am assuming that
hotplug does not override the manually loaded module parameters.

That is not terribly convenient to test right now. Can you suggest a simple
way to unload usb-uhci and load uhci without disabling my usb keyboard and
mouse?
