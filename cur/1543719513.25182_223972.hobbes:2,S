No.  I was asking about the mechanism in schedule() that, based on the 
value of "activated", allows some tasks to count their time on the run 
queue as sleep time.

But this probably answers my question anyway.

In the near future, I'll be proposing another patch that goes on top of 
the single priority array (SPA) patch that has the express purpose of 
reducing the time that all tasks spend on run queues.  I think that one 
of the side effects of this mechanism is that it will alleviate the 
problem you've described above.
I also think that their is a category of task that may be automatically 
detected and that needs special attention and that is tasks that need 
very regular access to small bursts of CPU.  I suspect that the tasks 
doing the mpeg and divx encoding/decoding that you refer to above fall 
into this category.  The key to identifying these tasks would be that 
the variance (or standard deviation) of their sleeps would be close to 
zero and as they probably do much the same amount of work each CPU burst 
the same would be true of the variance of the length of the CPU bursts. 
  Currently, the scheduler relies on the interactive bonus to make sure 
that these tasks get CPU when they need it but I suspect that to make 
this happen the interactive bonus has to be larger than it might 
otherwise need to be.  So if these tasks can be identified and treated 
specially (e.g. reserve the MAX_RT_PRIO slot for them) the interactive 
bonus could be reduced and this would improve overall system throughput.
