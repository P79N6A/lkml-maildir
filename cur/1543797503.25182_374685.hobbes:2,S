I'd say the sequence is:
1. create an linux/atomic.h the #include's asm/atomic.h
2. convert all asm/atomic.h to use linux/atomic.h
3. move common code to linux/atomic.h
There should be a small amount of time between 2. and 3. because 
doing all three steps at the same time in both Linus' tree and -mm
sounds like a hard task.
