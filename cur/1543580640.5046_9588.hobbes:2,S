Oh yeah, here's the two other things I forgot.
The install target of the devfsd GNUmakefile attempts to copy the
devfsd.8 man page into /usr/man/man8 which doesn't exist.  RH7 has
its man pages in /usr/share/man though you might prefer
/usr/local/man, whatever.  I just changed the GNUmakefile.
Also, RH7's /etc/rc.sysinit can already start devfsd automatically
with the following line:
    [ -e /dev/.devfsd -a -x /sbin/devfsd ] && /sbin/devfsd /dev
So, all you have to do is create an empty file /dev/.devfsd
