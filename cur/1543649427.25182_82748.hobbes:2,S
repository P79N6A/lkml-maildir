mincore needs to be taught to walk pagetables and to look up
stuff in swapcache.
Also it currently assumes that vma->vm_file is mapped linearly,
so it will return incorrect results with Ingo's nonlinear mapping
extensions.
But if we were to use Ingo's "file pte's" for all mmappings, mincore
only needs to do the pte->pagecache lookup, so it can lose the
"vma is linear" arithmetic.
