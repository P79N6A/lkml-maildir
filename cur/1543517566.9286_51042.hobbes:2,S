I've sent and received many millions (perhaps billions) of packets with 2.2.10
and this driver without problems (ping -f for days at a time).  I don't see why
it would start losing interrupts now.
Also, I did look at /proc/interrupts while doing the ping test, and the
interrupt count was going up (unfortunately I didn't examine it closely).
I'll see if I can reproduce it again and examine it more closely.
