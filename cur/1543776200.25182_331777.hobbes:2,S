Great, thanks! I'll play around with this:
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.13-rc1/2.6.13-rc1-mm1/broken-out/proc-pid-smaps.patch
Looks like it's been stable for 4 months?
Given that it's an independent /proc/$pid/smaps file,
it only needs to be queried when required and so
I wouldn't worry too much about cost. `top` wouldn't use it
for e.g., but specialised tools like mine would.
