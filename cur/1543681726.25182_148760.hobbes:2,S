I've just installed 2.6.0-test1 but whenever I try to use depmod, lsmod 
or insmod I get this error:
Module                  Size  Used by    Not tainted
lsmod: QM_MODULES: Function not implemented
I first noticed this when I was trying to install the nvidia drivers. 
Needless to say that I was unable to install them. What can I do to 
solve this problem? By the way,
depmod version 2.4.16
Thanks in advance,
Pedro Ribeiro
