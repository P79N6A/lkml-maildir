You should go back and read the start of this thread.  I've hired an 
IP Patent attorney to handle the Tux 2 Patent issue, and will be posting 
his analysis back to this community.  I have forwarded Daniel's 
designs and the specific patents and we are performing an infringement 
analysis. 
I think it's great that the USPTO has a website, but it's no subsitute
for "real" legal help to folks on this list.
