Yes. For interrupts or faults that's right. Syscalls are a bit special
though.

This is to clear any possible pending reservation if any. The problem is
that the reservation mecanism only works accross multiple CPUs. A normal
store at an address covered by a reservation on the same CPU will not break
the reservation. Thus, to protect from that, any interrupt or exception
makes sure to return to the normal code flow with any pending reservation
cleared.
