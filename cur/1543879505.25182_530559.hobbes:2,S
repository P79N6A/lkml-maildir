A pleasant surprise, though I did see it coming.

It probably needs further clarification that they're things on the order
of SCHED_FIFO, SCHED_RR, SCHED_NORMAL, etc.; some prioritization amongst
the classes is furthermore assumed, and so on. They're not quite
capable of being full-blown alternative policies, though quite a bit
can be crammed into them.
There are issues with the per- scheduling class data not being very
well-abstracted. A union for per-class data might help, if not a
dynamically allocated scheduling class -private structure. Getting
an alternative policy floating around that actually clashes a little
with the stock data in the task structure would help clarify what's
needed.

Bob Mullens banged out a virtual deadline interactive task scheduler
for Multics back in 1976 or thereabouts. ISTR the name Ferranti in
connection with deadline task scheduling for UNIX in particular. I've
largely seen deadline schedulers as a realtime topic, though. In any
event, it's not so radical as to lack a fair number of precedents.

A binomial heap would likely serve your purposes better than rbtrees.
It's faster to have the next item to dequeue at the root of the tree
structure rather than a leaf, for one. There are, of course, other
priority queue structures (e.g. van Emde Boas) able to exploit the
limited precision of the priority key for faster asymptotics, though
actual performance is an open question.
Another advantage of heaps is that they support decreasing priorities
directly, so that instead of removal and reinsertion, a less invasive
movement within the tree is possible. This nets additional constant
factor improvements beyond those for the next item to dequeue for the
case where a task remains runnable, but is preempted and its priority
decreased while it remains runnable.

I like not relying on timeslices. Timeslices ultimately get you into
a 2.4.x -like epoch expiry scenarios and introduce a number of RR-esque
artifacts therefore.

I'm always suspicious of these claims. A moderately formal regression
test suite needs to be assembled and the testcases rather seriously
cleaned up so they e.g. run for a deterministic period of time, have
their parameters passable via command-line options instead of editing
and recompiling, don't need Lindenting to be legible, and so on. With
that in hand, a battery of regression tests can be run against scheduler
modifications to verify their correctness and to detect any disturbance
in scheduling semantics they might cause.
A very serious concern is that while a fresh scheduler may pass all
these tests, later modifications may later cause failures unnoticed
because no one's doing the regression tests and there's no obvious
test suite for testing types to latch onto. Another is that the
testcases themselves may bitrot if they're not maintainable code.

Speaking of regression tests, let's please at least state intended
nice semantics and get a regression test for CPU bandwidth distribution
by nice levels going.

And there's another one. sched_yield() semantics need a regression test
more transparent than VolanoMark or other macrobenchmarks.
At some point we really need to decide what our sched_yield() is
intended to do and get something out there to detect whether it's
behaving as intended.

The SMP load balancing class operations strike me as unusual and likely
to trip over semantic issues in alternative scheduling classes. Getting
some alternative scheduling classes out there to clarify the issues
would help here, too.
A more general question here is what you mean by "completely fair;"
there doesn't appear to be inter-tgrp, inter-pgrp, inter-session,
or inter-user fairness going on, though one might argue those are
relatively obscure notions of fairness. Complete fairness arguably
precludes static prioritization by nice levels, so there is also
that. There is also the issue of what a fair CPU bandwidth distribution
between tasks of varying desired in-isolation CPU utilization might be.
I suppose my thorniest point is where the demonstration of fairness is
as, say, a testcase. Perhaps it's fair now; when will we find out when
that fairness has been disturbed?
What these things mean when there are multiple CPU's to schedule across
may also be of concern.
I propose the following two testcases:
(1) CPU bandwidth distribution of CPU-bound tasks of varying nice levels
	Create a number of tasks at varying nice levels. Measure the
	CPU bandwidth allocated to each.
	Success depends on intent: we decide up-front that a given nice
	level should correspond to a given share of CPU bandwidth.
	Check to see how far from the intended distribution of CPU
	bandwidth according to those decided-up-front shares the actual
	distribution of CPU bandwidth is for the test.
(2) CPU bandwidth distribution of tasks with varying CPU demands
	Create a number of tasks that would in isolation consume
	varying %cpu. Measure the CPU bandwidth allocated to each.
	Success depends on intent here, too. Decide up-front that a
	given %cpu that would be consumed in isolation should
	correspond to a given share of CPU bandwidth and check the
	actual distribution of CPU bandwidth vs. what was intended.
	Note that the shares need not linearly correspond to the
	%cpu; various sorts of things related to interactivity will
	make this nonlinear.
A third testcase for sched_yield() should be brewed up.
These testcases are oblivious to SMP. This will demand that a scheduling
policy integrate with load balancing to the extent that load balancing
occurs for the sake of distributing CPU bandwidth according to nice level.
Some explicit decision should be made regarding that.
