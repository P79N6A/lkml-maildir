This is fairly similar to the "up-opt" patch I have been using for my
2.4 standard (not -ac) kernels since last winter, available as
<

It's not a direct substitute for yours, since -ac changes kernel/sched.c
quite a bit, and it has some unnecessary patches to SMP code, but other
than that, I totally agree with the intention of your patch.
