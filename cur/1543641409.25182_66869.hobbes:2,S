Great.

And that's why there is some need for a cpufreq core (which manages
loops_per_jiffy etc.) and the need for the cpufreq drivers (#2 and #3 in my
previous mail).

Which is #1 - the "input" to the cpufreq core. This can be seperated from
the cpufreq core. So basically 
"policy input" --> "frequency input" --> cpufreq core --> cpufreq driver
  user-space    |                 k e r n e l  -  s p a c e
instead of
"policy input" --> "frequency input" --> cpufreq core --> cpufreq driver
     u s e r  -  s p a c e            |     k e r n e l  -  s p a c e
Linus, would you agree to the /proc interface as one of several
frequency "input"/management options? It's good for testing, for some 
workloads (LART), and it's (almost) done (just needs seperating from 
the cpufreq core)...
