This is my patch to add a "units=" parameter to ide-scsi.
It's useful for people that, like me, have more than one
ATAPI device in a machine. Sample usage:
modprobe ide_scsi units=hdc+hdd
to claim both hdc and hdd for ide-scsi.
modprobe ide_scsi units=hdd
to claim only hdd for ide-scsi, skipping all
other unclaimed devices.
This also works in the non-modular case. Simply pass
"ide_scsi.units=..." as a kernel boot argument.
The /* XXX: too horrible to explain */ comment refers to a
problem with the module_param implementation, which creates a
string literal from the kbuild-defined module name. Unfortunately
"ide_scsi" is a #define in <linux/ide.h>, so the string literal
ends up containing the value of ide_scsi rather than its spelling.
Hence the #undef.
