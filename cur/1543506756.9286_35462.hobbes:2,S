Good day, Mike,
	Thanks very much for taking over the diald package.  I and many
others appreciate your efforts to keep it updated.
	Have you been following the "ppp and 2.3.13" discussion on
linux-kernel?  If I might summarize, it appears that when the ppp code
moved to the new 2.3.9 pppd code in kernel 2.3.13, diald and the kernel
started fighting.  My laptop, which had been able to successfully connect
via diald in 2.2.x and 2.3.12- kernels, lost the ability.
	It doesn't appear to be solely the responsibility of pppd; pppd
actually goes so far as to get an IP address and runs the ip-up script,
but diald decides it's taking too long and kills it.  I'm typing right now
on a machine that dialed using diald and made the connection.  The only
reason I got more than a minute of connect time was the use of "killall -9
diald" before diald decided to abort the connection attempt.  pppd stayed
in the background and is transferring packets just fine.
	Tim Coleman summarized the problem even better than I:
I have found that diald works fine with pppd 2.3.9.  The problem is that
diald does *not* seem to work with kernel version 2.3.1[34].
pppd 2.3.9 works for me with kernels 2.3.1[14], and diald+pppd 2.3.9
works with 2.2.x, but diald+pppd 2.3.9 with kernels 2.3.1[34] seems to
time out before completing the connection.
This has been tested with diald 0.16 and 0.99.1.
	My experience and observations almost exactly match Tim's, except
I can add that the problem persists into kernel 2.3.15-pre3.
	I attached the log entry from this laptop.  The first attempt to
connect "timed out", even though pppd 2.3.9 had gotten an IP address.  The
second attempt continued to live because, as I said, I killed -9 diald.
In a normal connect, the next line to show up after "pppd...Remote IP
address..." would be "diald...local ip...remote ip...".
	Is there a chance that pppd is failing to return something to
diald that signals the connection is complete?  Is anyone successfully
using diald with 2.3.13+ kernels?
	Cheers,
	- Bill
