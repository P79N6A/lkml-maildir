because i misread your last patch :-) I thought it still has a window 
for inaccuracy, but you are right: it should be at most 1 jiffy 
inaccurate, no matter how many times we restart.
still ... the hrtimers patch has been submitted to lkml before yours, 
and has been tested extensively, so why go the extra side-jump 
prolonging the jiffies sleep method? The LTP failure has been there 
since the inception of the futex code i suspect. Going this way also 
enables the addressing of a more pressing need: the elimination of 
glibc's forced use of relative futex timeouts.
