Yup. That would mean making the freezer reentrant since we will
be freezing twice (once for suspend and later on for hotplug). This is
ok since the api in my patches looks like
freeze_processes(int freeze_event);
But thaw will be interesting. If we are thawing for hotplug, we gotta
only thaw processes which were frozen *only* for hotplug.
Rafael, does that mean more status flags?!
Thanks and Regards
