To clarify: we can't change detach_pid() and remove the line that clears
task->pids[type].pid right now. Look for example at get_task_pid(), it
could be used without rcu, using the previously pinned task_struct.
But in the long term this might be right.
(As for pid_alive(). Can't we rename it? Its name is very misleading, and it
 shouldn't play with ->pids, this looks confusing. Just do p->sighand != 0)

Something like the patch below. What do you think? setsid/setpgrp now
can use change_pid(). The change in transfer_pid() needs a separate
patch with the fat changelog.
This doesn't solve the problem with task_tgid() == NULL, but at least
this is not possible with task == current.
