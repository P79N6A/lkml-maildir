In my case I'm only seeing it when running under Xen, so I don't think 
this particular problem is apic related.  My current theory - dreamed up 
last night and completely untested/uninvestigated - is that interrupt 
masking isn't working.  In Xen, interrupts are masked via a per-cpu 
piece of memory shared with the hypervisor, so if the percpu setup is 
wrong in some way, the kernel and Xen could be using different memory 
for the mask, with hilarious results.
