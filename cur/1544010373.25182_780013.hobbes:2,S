The whole point of the introduction is that this is aimed at someone who
doesn't know what they're doing, so IMO the "either" is quite correct here.

The problem is I need to describe some terminology, and the best way to do
that is with some pictures.  I was wondering if I should break this out into a
separate document and simplify what I keep.
In my opinion, it's much easier to deal with if you can visualise how it
works, even if that visualisation isn't a true representation of reality,
which references Miklos's points.

Perhaps.  The main thing I want to introduce is the idea of a tree with three
levels, as it were: commits, directories, files.

Hmmm.  So what would you suggest is a good way to write for GIT newbies?  Is
it just that the overview should be canned or drastically simplified?
