Agreed. I should read all my mail before replying..

NT support? Heh. The most likely route for cheap PC NUMA is 200+ Mhz
memory buses (Athlon and P4 systems), 64-bit PCI-66 and the like (server
disk subsystems will probably make this a desktop reality), and bus
bridges made to replace gig ethernet in Beowulfs..
