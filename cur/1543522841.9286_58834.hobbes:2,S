Yet another version of my patch for root-hopping, for pre-2.3.40-6:
ftp://lrcftp.epfl.ch/pub/people/almesber/misc/umount-root-3.tar.gz
This one I've tested with a real NFS root. There was one problem:
rpciod is created as a child of mount, so it doesn't share current->fs
with init, and therefore doesn't leave the original / on chroot. I've
fixed it by adding a call to exit_fs to linux/net/sunrpc/sched.c:rpciod
(rpciod doesn't use files anyway).
The NFS root example is described in the README.
