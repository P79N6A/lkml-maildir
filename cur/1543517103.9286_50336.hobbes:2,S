HI,
  I have given several printk statements in ip_input.c
file in the net directory. Due to these the
/var/log/messages file has got filled up and am not
able to open the file. I cannot delete the messages
file. Because when i delete it i am not able to boot
the kernel. 
  Any suggestions will be highly appreciated.
THANKS
SUJIT
