   First he introduces CLONE_THREAD (or how it was called).  This was
   fine.  But in pre2 ore pre3 he unified CLONE_SIGHAND and CLONE_THREAD
   under the new name CLONE_SIGNAL which makes perfect if CLONE_SIGHAND
   would be used.  But it is.  Simply undo this change, separate the two
   flags.
This has been fixed in test8 (final).  CLONE_SIGHAND and CLONE_THREAD
are seperate bits again, and CLONE_SIGNAL is both of them or'ed
together.
