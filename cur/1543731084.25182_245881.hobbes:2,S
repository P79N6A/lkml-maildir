I've released version 0.9 of ketchup. Ketchup manages the task of
downloading and patching between various kernel trees, taking most of
the busy work out of keeping your kernel trees current. This version
should fix the issues with the new 4-part versioning scheme.
Features:
- knows about multiple trees, including 2.4, 2.6, 2.6-bk, 2.6-mm, and 2.6-tiny
- can automatically determine the latest version of a given tree
- can patch between any release in the same major branch (eg 2.4 or 2.6)
- automatically downloads patches as needed
- maintains a cache of patches which can be shared among users
- verifies GPG signatures
- can print current versions and URLs for use in automation scripts
Sample usage:
$ ketchup 2.6
2.6.8-rc3-mm1 -> 2.6.8.1
Applying 2.6.8-rc3-mm1.bz2 -R
Applying patch-2.6.8-rc3.bz2 -R
Applying patch-2.6.8.bz2
Applying patch-2.6.8.1.bz2
