See the archives, this has been discussed before. Aside from some 
developers just not liking C++, the main problem area is that there are 
cases where C++ just does too much behind the programmer's back to be 
practical in a kernel, where things like stack usage are critical. Also, 
a number of C++ features like exceptions would be difficult to support.

Some type of RCU list may be doable, but not with the same code. RCU 
needs to have a way of knowing that all old copies of a data structure 
are no longer in use. In the kernel this is done by checking if all CPUs 
have scheduled since accessing the structure, but that concept doesn't 
really exist in userspace.
