It would have been nice to spend a few hours cleaning up ext3 and JBD
before doing this.  The code isn't toooo bad, but there are number of
coding style problems, whitespace screwups, incorrect comments, missing
comments, poorly-chosen variable names and all of that sort of thing.
One the fs has been copied-and-pasted, it's much harder to address these
things: either need to do it twice, or allow the filesystems to diverge, or
not do it.
Also, -mm presently has two patches pending against fs/jbd/ and nine pending
against fs/ext3/.  We should get all those things merged before taking the
copy.
Also, JBD is presently feeding into submit_bh() buffer_heads which span two
machine pages, and some device drivers spit the dummy.  It'd be better to
fix that once, rather than twice..
