Huh? _spin_lock calls kmem_cache_free?

This should not happen. __drain_alien_cache frees node local elements
thus cache_free_alien should not be called. However, if the slab 
management was allocated on a different node from the slab data then we 
may have an issue. However, both slab managemnt and the slab data are 
allocated on the same node (with alloc_pages_node() and kmalloc_node).
If something went wrong with kmalloc_node or alloc_pages_node (fallback?) 
then we may have an issue. Guess we need to look into this some more.
Alok,  have you thought about this issue before?
