See the thread "2.3.31 breaks cpp with segmentation fault".
Here it is the same thing, compiling ppp_deflate also causes a sig-11,
also gcc doesn't build any more, a "make bootstrap" ends up with a
sig-11 too, and many other programs doesn't also compile any more
when kernel 2.3.31 is running. Up to 2.3.30 everything was ok,
since 2.3.31 (and 2.3.31-pre2 too) something is broken.
The sig-11's do not depend on what gcc version is in use,
I tried 2.7.2.3 and 2.95.[12] also.
Currrently I'm trying to locate the error by reverting the diffs
from 2.3.30 to 2.3.31 but it will take a week to finish as far as
I can see :\
Here is the strace output of the sig 11 when trying to compile
ppp_deflate under 2.3.31, I hope it will be useful for somebody:
