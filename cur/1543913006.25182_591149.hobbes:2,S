No. Neither the BSD license nor the GPL license permit you to revoke rights.
Mr. Floeter's code is still available under the BSD/ISC license. The BSD
license does not require you to make derived works available under a BSD
license. *His* code is still available under a BSD/ISC license, of course,
but the changed code is not.
Read the BSD license. It does not require changes to be made available under
a compatible license. This is the main difference between the BSD and GPL
licenses.
Note that it would be an error to remove the BSD license text, as the BSD
license requires you to keep it and you still need the BSD license to grant
you distribution rights to the original work. However, the license does not
apply to protectable aspects of the code not placed under the BSD license by
their original author, and it is important to add a note to that effect.
