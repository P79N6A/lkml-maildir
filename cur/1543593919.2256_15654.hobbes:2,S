No, it's wrong.  I'm getting BUG()s in clear_inode():
485             if (inode->i_data.nrpages)
486                     BUG();
(gdb) p inode->i_data
$5 = {clean_pages = {next = 0xd7423ae4, prev = 0xc1628280}, dirty_pages = {next = 0xd7423aec, prev = 0xd7423aec}, 
  locked_pages = {next = 0xd7423af4, prev = 0xd7423af4}, nrpages = 0x1, a_ops = 0xc02e4940, host = 0xd7423a40, 
  i_mmap = 0x0, i_mmap_shared = 0x0, i_shared_lock = {lock = 0x1}, gfp_mask = 0x5}
(gdb) p *(struct page *)0xd7423ae4
$6 = {list = {next = 0xd7423ae4, prev = 0xc1628280}, mapping = 0xd7423aec, index = 0xd7423aec, 
  next_hash = 0xd7423af4, count = {counter = 0xd7423af4}, flags = 0x1, lru = {next = 0xc02e4940, 
    prev = 0xd7423a40}, age = 0x0, wait = {lock = {lock = 0x0}, task_list = {next = 0x1, prev = 0x5}}, 
  pprev_hash = 0x0, buffers = 0x0, virtual = 0x0, zone = 0x0}
(gdb) p &inode->i_data
The lists are mangled.
I think what's happening is:
                curr = curr->next;
                offset = page->index;
                /* Is one of the pages to truncate? */
                if ((offset >= start) || (*partial && (offset + 1) == start)) {
                        list_del(head);
                        list_add_tail(head, curr);
`curr' can point to `head' when we get inside the `if'.
So we do, effectively,
	list_del(head);
	list_add_tail(head, head);
Which turns mapping->clean_pages into an empty list,
and the target page.list thinks it's on a list, but
really isn't.  A subsequent list_del() on the page
screws things up somehow.
Ho-hum.  I'll have another go tomorrow.  Probably a
simple `if (curr != head)' will cure it.
