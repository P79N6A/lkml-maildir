For testing, your NUMA emulation code is perfect IMO. But for memory
resource control your NUMA emulation code may be too simple.
With my patch, CONFIG_NUMA_EMU provides a way to partition a machine
into several smaller nodes, regardless if the machine is using NUMA or
not.
This NUMA emulation code together with CPUSETS could be seen as a
simple alternative to the memory resource control provided by CKRM.
