Found out something else this morning.  I'm going to assume that my problem
is different than yours.  I booted single user mode to see if the system
starting cardmgr was causing an irq to be changed (It hit me this morning,
but I'm wrong after trying.  What I thought of was since the cdrom wasn't in
the machine it assigned irq 15 to the slot and with it it assigned 12.  This
isn't the case).  While in single user, I typed gpm.  Instantly the keyboard
and mouse froze.
I'm using debian potato on the machine.  It starts pcmcia services before
gpm.  Maybe this has a bearing on things.
Miles, try booting single user and see if you have keyboard and mouse
usability.
