Force a read() before some write data was flushed to the disk??
Well, if you insist, just do a raw read of the device after
you find the inode, then offset, that your data is on. You
can walk the same fs structure(s) as the active file-system
to get all meta-data information.
...but... The most current data is probably in the kernel
buffers. I don't think you really want what you are asking
for. If you did a fdatasync(), you get the current data your
process wrote to go to the disk. However, there may be
other writers. This, too, may not be what you want. Also,
Just because the data was queued to go to a (SCSI) disk,
doesn't mean it actually got to the platters.
Cheers,
