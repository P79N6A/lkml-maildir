As I see it, there's those that would join in at different times. If the
point was to get as many people moving to newer kernels, then this would
make the most people comfortable to try a newer kernel. Maybe not the
latest and greatest, but at least one that is closer to the newest one.
Some might join 6 months behind, others 1 month and even those at 1
week. I've talked to different people, and there are many at the 1 week
point (the ones with the most critical systems would be at the 6 month,
but the 1 weekers are the ones that would put it on a more non essential
machine).

Truth be told... don't worry about backporting fixes. This is the Open
Source world, many eyes, and many developers.  When a bug is reported,
say to 2.6.x.y, then let some new kernel developer try to fix it, or
whoever. Maybe even the one who reported the problem can fix it. But for
that branch only. If this bug is in a earlier branch, then don't worry
about it until someone else hits it, or say the one who fixed it, then
goes back and checks other branches only if they want to. 
I'm saying, just have the branches available, with no guarantee that
they have all the backported bugs, since no one is going to do it. But
if someone wants it, then they can have a go at it. Maybe even a distro
might add to it.  This might just give people a central repository to
all the fixes applied to a specific branch.  Again, only bug fixes and
nothing more.

If there problem is truly a problem and if these people are capable of
fixing it themselves or finding someone else to fix it. Then again, you
have the fix at some point available for all.
