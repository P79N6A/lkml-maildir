Subject: [PATCH 08/21] mm: ia64 use expand_upwards
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/10/12/216

ia64 has expand_backing_store function for growing its Register Backing
Store vma upwards.  But more complete code for this purpose is found in
the CONFIG_STACK_GROWSUP part of mm/mmap.c.  Uglify its #ifdefs further
to provide expand_upwards for ia64 as well as expand_stack for parisc.
The Register Backing Store vma should be marked VM_ACCOUNT.  Implement
the intention of growing it only a page at a time, instead of passing an
address outside of the vma to handle_mm_fault, with unknown consequences.
