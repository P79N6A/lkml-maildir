yes, this was the problem on my box as well, this was the main reason for
bootmem.c. Take a look at arch/i386/kernel/setup.c, it parses the memory
allocation table and passes it down to bootmem.c via bootmem_free().
page_alloc.c (where mem_map is allocated) uses bootmem_alloc(), and
bootmem_alloc() makes sure we do not step on reserved memory. (reserved
memory can be a memory hole, device memory, kernel-reserved memory,
anything.) bootmem_alloc() always allocates continuous physical RAM, on my
box it allocates an over 100MB mem_map[].
