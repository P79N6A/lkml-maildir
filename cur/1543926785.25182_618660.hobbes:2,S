Is there something "sacred" about version numbers that we need to be
stingy with them as they are a finite resource?  :)
This way, we have specific, easy to identify points in the development
process to help users in case they report problems to let the developers
easily narrow down the potential problem.
That, and I couldn't think of some other way to name the -rc patches, so
I used the minor version number.  Because of that, I was forced to name
the final releases with the same minor number to keep everyone sane over
time.
thanks,
