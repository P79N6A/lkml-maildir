That hardly applies to what I'm saying here.  The melissa virus author was
caught because MS Office products encode a signature in each document
which can be tracked back to that author.  This sytem of signing was neither
requested by the users, nor were they aware of it.
I'll repeat, I only want the kernel to find the serial number, dump it to
screen if I so compile my kernel, and log it if i want.  All at MY option.
if I have a room with 50 PIII machines, and they all get stolen, and I run
across a machine or ten I think were once mine, I would like to be able to
prove that those machines are mine.  Let's face it, Dell Dimensions all look
the same, and the external serial numbers can get changed.  The CPU serial
number can't.
I am NOT NOT NOT advocating making the number grepping and recording a
default action.  It should have to be selected as a kernel compile time
option.
