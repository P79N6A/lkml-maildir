Only people who want to log-in from the network..... Of course
you could force a re-write of all the stuff like telnet, adding
another layer of bugs that'll take another N years to find and
remove.
I think you really need to leave the "legacy" stuff alone. Somebody
installs a new kernel and then can't log in from the Network. Not
good at all.
