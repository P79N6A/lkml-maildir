Hi,
- i reinstalled a  linux box (64 MB, AMD300, Network DC21143 (de4x5.c), 
   2 ide, one old scsi disk) Box this week 
- has mail service(imapd),nfs, smb, postgres, mysql, http, ssh (2.3), isdn running
- this box runs fine when i boot into the regular 2.2.16
  redhat 7.0 standard Kernel.
after upgrading to the last test release (test9pre9) (1 before Linus final beta)      
i realized (and a User of the mail-system too) that there are stalls
in the network connection to the box.
I worked with ssh with this box. I can see no pattern but i have
3-5 seconde stalls  when i work with the box ( after 1 minute, 
after 10 minutes.. ??? )
same for mail, smb
- network connections never break, but they all seem to be slower
  (no testing with a tool so far... my impression (and of another user too))
- the box was not heavy loaded at the testing time. 
  (Services where running, isdn connection up, mail connection to one user, and ssh to my box)
- this seems not logical to me, i have no dma transfer to my (UDMA) disks in 2.2.16
  (but in 2.4.0test9pre9  so the box should have less load then in 2.2.16)
Regards
Dietmar
