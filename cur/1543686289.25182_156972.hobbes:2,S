While we're off in never-never land, it'd be nice to specify default
values for struct initialisers.  eg, something like:
struct pci_device_id {
        __u32 vendor = PCI_ANY_ID;
        __u32 device = PCI_ANY_ID;
        __u32 subvendor = PCI_ANY_ID;
	__u32 subdevice = PCI_ANY_ID;
        __u32 class = 0;
	__u32 class_mask = 0;
        kernel_ulong_t driver_data = 0;
};
Erm, hang on a second ...  Since when are PCI IDs 32-bit?  What is this
ridiculous bloat?  You can't even argue that this makes things pack
better since this packs equally well:
struct pci_device_id {
        __u16 vendor;
        __u16 device;
        __u16 subvendor;
        __u16 subdevice;     
        __u32 class;
        __u32 class_mask;
        kernel_ulong_t driver_data;
};
