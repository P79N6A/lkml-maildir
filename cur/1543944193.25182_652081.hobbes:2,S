For the extreme case you are correct. There's an inherent trade-off
between IOMMU performance and protection guarantees, where one end of
the spectrum is represented by the streaming DMA-API and the other end
is represented by simply mapping all available memory. It's an open
question what is the right point in between. I think that an optimal
strategy might be "keep the mapping around for as long as it is safe",
i.e., keep a mapping to a frame for as long as the frame is owned by
whoever requested the mapping in the first place. Once ownership of
the frame is passed to another entity (e.g., from the driver to the
stack), revoke the original mapping. This implies a way for the kernel
to track frame ownership and communicate frame ownership changes to
the DMA-API layer, which we don't currently have.
