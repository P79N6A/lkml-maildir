           Summary: i386 SMP : IRQ routing problems
    Kernel Version: 2.5.68
            Status: NEW
          Severity: blocking
             Owner: mbligh@aracnet.com
         Submitter: josh@stack.nl
Distribution: Mandrake 9.1
Hardware Environment: Dual PII 333 on Intel 440 LX SMP mainboard
Software Environment: Bare shell after kernel boot
Problem Description: CPU 1 stops accepting interrupts, APIC IRQ rerouting
doesn't work. As a result, only CPU 0 receives timer interrupts (and thus I got
practically an UP system), and my devices don't work when IRQ rerouting (MPS 1.4
in my BIOS) is enabled, for they claim the wrong (read: the one before
rerouting) interrupt line.
NOTE: both bugs also occur in the 2.4.21 kernel that Mandrake 9.1 ships, but as
this is a Mandrake-hack you might not really care. Other 2.4 kernels untested at
this moment.
Steps to reproduce:
Check /proc/interrupts after booting.
To check whether it is a Mandrake thing, I cleared the lilo append options,
removed the Mandrake initrd, and performed a sulogin first thing after entering
rc.sysinit. This didn't affect the problems.

 you should be able to find all
files / output that might be useful in solving this.
