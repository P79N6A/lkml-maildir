Would be nice to have a stable qlogic driver in the main kernel.
Although last time i tried Matt Jabob's driver, it locked up
after 30 seconds of running bonnie. At least with Qlogic's
driver I can run bonnie and cerberus continuously for 2 weeks
with no problems (although this may have been because
Matt's driver ignored the command queue throttle set in the
qlogic cards BIOS).

The qlogic HBAs are a real problem in choosing which driver
to use out of:
in kernel qlogicfc
Qlogic's qla2x00 v4.x, v5.x, v6.x
Matthew Jacob's isp_mod
What are people out there using with their QLA 2200/2300s?
