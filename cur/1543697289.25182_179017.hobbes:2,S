The hell it is.  We are through with legacy probes, we are through with
init_etherdev(), we are practically through with static struct net_device.
However, we still have weird allocators (I've got almost all of them
done by now, will submit in the next batch) and we still have struct
net_device embedded as a field of other structures in several drivers.
It's nowhere near as massive as legacy probes series, but it's going to
be 10--20 patches.  At least.
