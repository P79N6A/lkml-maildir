hello to all list members
I use 2.4.32 kernel.
when the system is running in the network, after some
days It's hard disk will be crashed.
this is where, I convert It's filesystem from ext2 to
ext3 by "tune2fs" command.
by the way during the bootup, I see the following
message  on the console :
  host/uhci.c : d800 : host controller halted. very bad
