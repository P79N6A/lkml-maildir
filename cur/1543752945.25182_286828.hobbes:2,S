I've not tried the patch yet, but with 1G mem / 1G swap when I finally
hit the swap and quit the program that uses it (straw, gimp..), machine
will stop responding for 10-15sec. 
I have 'elevator=cfq' in boot command and this is SMP. Last seen
yesterday when shutting down 2.6.10-rc2-mm4 to try out latest -mm.
I did vmstat runs a while ago, but didn't see anything really out of
line, maybe it didn't get data either (or I don't know what is normal).
