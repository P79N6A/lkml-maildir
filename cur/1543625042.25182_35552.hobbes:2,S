   IMHO it would be interesting to compare the size and complexity of
   using a hash table for the page tables with a 5-level tree.  For a
   32-bit address space I think the tree wins hands down but for a full
   64-bit address space I am not convinced either way at present.
You only need a 4-level tree for a full 64-bit address space as long
as you can guarentee less than (32 + PAGE_SHIFT) bits of physical
addressing (ie. you can use 32-bit pmd_t's and pgd_t's in that case).
At least this is how I remember the numbers working out.
