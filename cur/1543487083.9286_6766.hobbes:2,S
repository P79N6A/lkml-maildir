AHA! Look at this (from a pukka 2.2.2 tree on i386)
#define NR_TASKS        512     /* On x86 Max 4092, or 4090 w/APM
configured. */
#define MAX_TASKS_PER_USER (NR_TASKS/2)
#define MIN_TASKS_LEFT_FOR_ROOT 4
OK, why is it only 512 instead of 4092? No wonder I ran out of processes
so quickly. *sigh* Another re-compile awaits me. 
Cheers,
Alex
