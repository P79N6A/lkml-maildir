    Hi Linus,
    as you probably know the gendisk handling in the current kernel is a
    horrible mess.  All driver have to do the linked list handling themselves,
    etc..
    Andries has a patchset on kernel.org that addresses most of this issues -
    but it does very large API changes and is thus not acceptable for 2.4.
    The appended patch tries to cleanup the gendisk handling for the in-kernel
    driver a LOT, keeping all old APIs for posssible out-of-tree drivers.
Hmm - this looks almost identical to my patch 07.
Yes, a nice patch :-)
Andries
[BTW - I don't think the API changes are so large.
Now patch 01 has been applied.
Something very similar to 02 seems also a good candidate.
Maybe I have time Friday or Saturday to rediff.]
