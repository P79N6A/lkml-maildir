The goal of the oom killer is to kill a rogue memory hogging task, which 
will lead to future memory freeing once the task dies, and allow the 
system or container to resume normal operation.
You're not realizing the power of /proc/pid/oom_adj: it allows you to tune 
the badness scoring so that YOU, the user, may determine what the 
definition of 'rogue' is on a task-by-task basis.
Your patch simply allows users to specify a task by name that will always 
be killed first when the oom killer is invoked.  That's terribly 
insufficient if another task uses an excessive amount of memory that you 
didn't expect; a rogue task may be leaking memory and the task you've 
identified by name with your patch is repeatedly forked and killed when 
the rogue task goes untouched.
With oom_adj scores, you can easily specify at what point each task should 
be considered rogue.  You can elevate the oom_adj score for those you have 
a preference to kill and reduce the oom_adj score for those that you'd 
prefer being deferred _unless_ they get sufficiently out of hand.
Your patch presents a shortcut where the entire badness scoring (and, 
thus, all oom_adj scores) is ignored if the named task exists.  That not 
only has syncronization issues, but also can cause the kernel to loop 
forever in killing a task by the same name without ever freeing memory for 
anything else.
Additionally, your patch completely breaks cpuset oom killing since 
candidacy is determined in badness() because a task may have allocated 
non-migrated memory elsewhere before being moved to a different cpuset.  
Your oom_victim_name task may exist globally, but will always be 
identified for oom kill even when the oom exists exclusively in a disjoint 
cpuset.  That does _not_ lead to future memory freeing that current can 
use, and if the parent of the killed task decides to immediately fork 
another instance, this cpuset will be completely livelocked.
