I can't imagine that the details of the fops functions are a problem,
since they never get called.
static struct file_operations foo_fops = {
    .owner   = THIS_MODULE,
    .open    = foo_open,
    .read    = foo_read,
    .write   = foo_write,
    .mmap    = foo_mmap,
    .release = foo_release
};
static int __init
init_foo(void)
{
    int err;
    err = register_chrdev(foo_major, "foo", &foo_fops);
    if(err)
	return err;
    return 0;
}
static void __exit
exit_foo(void)
{
    unregister_chrdev(foo_major, "foo");
}
