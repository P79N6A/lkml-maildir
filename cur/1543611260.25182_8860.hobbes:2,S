I just posted the updated design notes covering the multi-page bios.
Same place: i.e. 
http://lse.sourceforge.net/io/bionotes.txt
The intent of these notes is to set the changes in the context of past
discussions related to the block layer design. It attempts to cover some of the
alternatives and ideas put forth by various people, analyse pros and cons,
cover the rationale behind some of the design decisions, and peek into a
few ideas that people are thinking about/ working on, which may not already
be in there yet.
Any additions to make this more complete/interesting or any corrections (I may
have missed some things) are welcome.
Regards
Suparna
