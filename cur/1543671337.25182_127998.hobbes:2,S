You mean a regular file?  I'm not sure whether this could be made to
work.  The /proc/PID/maps entry (really: the vm_area for the kernel
ELF images) would have to be created by the kernel, at a time when no
real filesystem is available.  Also, since the kernel needs to store
the data in kernel-memory anyhow, I don't think there is much point in
storing it on disk as well.
