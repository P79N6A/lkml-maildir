For now, sticking to POSIX behavior is simply not worth it.  Several
Makefiles already use this technique, and they are SO much easier to
maintain than the other Makefiles.  I just converted
drivers/net/Makefile to this new method.
rum:/spare/cvs/linux_2_3> find . -name Makefile|xargs grep -l -- obj-m
./drivers/cdrom/Makefile
./drivers/char/pcmcia/Makefile
./drivers/net/Makefile
./drivers/net/pcmcia/Makefile
./drivers/sound/lowlevel/Makefile
./drivers/sound/Makefile

Any solution which makes these Makefiles larger as a result of
portability changes will probably be frowned upon.  Also, the kernel
relies heavily on gcc'isms.  I doubt people really care that much about
having portable Makefiles.  The kernel will be requiring the GNU
toolchain for some time to come...
If you really want portable Makefiles, we need to go to an automake-like
system which generates true, POSIX-portable Makefiles from Makefile.am
meta-makefiles.
