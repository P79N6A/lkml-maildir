Hi,
A note in front: I realize that my question is rather broad and a bit
vague, sorry for that :)
The VFS is a great solution to transparently operate on different file
systems by designating an interface for file systems that separates 
file system specific code from higher levels. 
Doesn't however this very feature also represent a limiting factor in
some way? Surely you can map pretty much anything to the Common File
System model, but is or has the VFS interface design been limiting
in any way in contemporary file system design ? 
thanks for your time.
regards,
Tobi
