Suppose A is pulling job requests off a queue.
A takes the mutex because it is going to modify data protected by the 
mutex.  It then gives up the mutex when it's done modifying the data.

Suppose A then pulls another job request off the queue.  It just so 
happens that this job requires touching some data protected by the same 
mutex.  It would need to take the mutex again.
A doesn't necessarily know what data the various jobs will require it to 
access, so it doesn't know a priori what mutexes will be required.
