I've now tried the Intel driver, no help, still get the NFS timeouts (the
intel driver doesn't output anything to dmesg, so it's no way of telling if
the same things occur as in the eepro100 stock-kernel driver). 
This is how I do the test:
NFS share a filesystem
NFS mount it on another box (not running intel e100 nic)
Start bonnie++ on the box that has mounted the nfs share
After 10-20mins, the first NFS timeout comes (which means the card is out of
resources, and "halts" for a bit). When the card becomes out of resources,
it seems like it uses a few minutes before it comes online again, no wonder
why, tho.
Has anyone got any suggestions on how to start tracking down, and maybe
fixing this problem?  Or, is this a hardware error?  Or maybe a firmware
error?  Should I start contacting Dell and tell them that's there's a
possible error in their PowerEdge 2550-series?
