Hello All,
    Am I doing something stupid or is it not possible to enable RARP when
you configure a 2.3.15 kernel?  There is an option that makes the kernel
try to use RARP when it boots to get its IP address, but thats not what
I am looking for.  I want to kernel to be able to tell my wife's iMac
what its IP address is when the iMac boots.
Thanks,
Jim
