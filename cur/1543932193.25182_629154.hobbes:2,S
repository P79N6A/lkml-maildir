Good news someone is working on this bug again. Also good news you
already found a bug in there.

Not really architecture independant, I believe, because thos are
drivers for peripherals _inside_ Atmel Cores ;-)

I know, but I have some troubles to get 'quilt mail' to work from
behind a proxy server, and attaching to a mail, at least it does not
corrupt the contents of the patches.

OK.

There is a huge list of macros below these definitions. By doing it
this way, the macros still fit on 80 characters wide, while without
them, I had split up the macros over several lines, which does not
make it more readable. That's all.
'l' refers at the last letter of __raw_readl, and writel. Nothing special.

I used scripts/Lindent to reformat the file, and then I removed the
quirks Lindent put in the file. Apparantly I missed that one.

Hmm, I seem to have missed that one. Why is it not there in a
big-AT91-patch from Andrew?

Funny, This was the first thing that Andrew started complaining about.
He suggested to put an inline there which I had not. I already
mentioned that this was against the CodingStyle, but I also mentioned
that I did not wanted to start a fight about this :-)
So, to prevent a discussion, I added the inline...

I blame scripts/Lindent ;-)

Go ahead...
I did not remove any comment, even if they appear useless to me. I am
not the maintainer of this driver, and just wanted to improve it, so
that it was able of running on Preempt-RT.
Before being able to submit the change that really mattered to me, I
had to make the driver pass the scripts/checkpatch.pl check, otherwise
the patch-that-matters would be completely unreadable.

As mentioned, did not want to change it that much.

And would add some extra brackets etc.
I did not try to make it perfect ;-)

Guess, that wouldn't fit either?

Yep. All calls that block on a Mutex somehow on Preempt-RT. (such as
spinlocks, wakeup_interruptible() and many of its friends.)

To prevent rewriting the code completely. 1 change was in a read
routine, the other at a different location.

I used the NODELAY patch for the 8250 serial port as reference, it
contains similar code, and I tried to make both look the same.

Thank you for reviewing it.
I will have a look at it in again later this week.
Have you any idea how we can integrate both patch series (yours and
mine) without interfering each other? This patchset was quite
annoying, because through multiple channels patches are submitted, and
even stacked up...
Kind Regards,
Remy
