Yes

Not necessarily, the io schedulers keep track of where we are going. You
don't need an active front request for that.

I know this is a pet peeve of yours (must be, I remember you bringing it
up at least 3 time before :), but I don't think that's necessarily true.
It shouldn't matter _one_ bit whether you leave the request there or
not, it's unmergeable. As long as the io scheduler keeps track of this
(and it does!) we are golden.
