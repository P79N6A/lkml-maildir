Christoph, Maybe you can clear one thing up.  Was this proposal an
addition to or replacement of Andrea's?  I assumed an addition.  I am
going to try to restrict my responses to ones appropriate for that
assumption.

I can agree to doing the flush after as long as I get a flag from the
mmu notifier saying this flush will be repeated later without locks
held.  That would be fine with me.  If we don't have that then the
export_notifiers would need to be expanded to cover all cases of pte
clearing.  Baring one of the two, I would argue we have an unworkable
solution for XPMEM.  This is because of allocations which is touched
upon later.

Given one of the two compromises above, I believe this will then work
for XPMEM.  The callouts were placed as they are now to prevent the
mmu_notifier callouts from having to do work.

As an example of thousands, we currently have one customer job that
has 16880 processors all with the same physical page faulted into their
address space.  The way XPMEM is currently structured, there is fan-out of
that PFN information so we would not need to queue up that many messages,
but it would still be considerable.  Our upcoming version of the hardware
will potentially make this fanout worse because we are going to allow
even more fine-grained divisions of the machine to help with memory
error containment.

We have a counter associated with a pfn that indicates when the pfn is no
longer referenced by other partitions.  This counter triggers changing of
memory protections so any subsequent access to this page will result in
a memory error on the remote partition (this should be an illegal case).

I assumed Christoph intended this to be part of our memory protection
changing phase.  Once we have raised memory protections for the page,
clear the bit.  When we lower memory protections, set the bit.

As I said before, I was under the assumption that Christoph was proposing
this as an addition to your notifiers, not a replacement.
Thanks,
