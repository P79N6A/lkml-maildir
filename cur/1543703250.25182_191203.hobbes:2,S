Pretty interessting stuff! I will inspect if i could combine
it with the "real-time interrupts" i recently described
(
http://www.linuxdevices.com/articles/AT6105045931.html
).
Currently i'm protecting critical areas with "prioritized
spinlocks" that don't provide a priority inversion aviodance
scheme. Having "real" mutexes with priority inheritence
should be pretty helpfull to make the kernel hard real time
aware.
best regards
