Hi just found previous report about my troubles
dating 2002-07-20
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=102718248323184&w=2
and the fix is already in 2.4.20-pre7 
but sadly i still have the problem with the fix applied
my local LAN is 10Mb and the onboard NIC doesn't want to do anything
else then 100Mb, and i get a lot of errors 
ETDEV WATCHDOG: eth1: transmit timed out
eth1: Transmit timed out, status 0000, PHY status 786d, resetting...
NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth1: transmit timed out
eth1: Transmit timed out, status 0000, PHY status 786d, resetting...
[etc, etc, ...]
mobo EPoX 8K5A-3+ KT333 + VT8235 2.4.19-pre10jam3(with/without the fix) 
couldn't find 2.4.20-pre7 with SGI's xfs :( to test
dmesg @

fix  @ 
http://varna.demon.co.uk/~svetlio/via-rhine.c.diff
lspci -vvv @ 
http://varna.demon.co.uk/~svetlio/LSPCI
so i wanted to ask whether someone has it working
and if there is a newer fix? :)
Best Regards,
svetljo
