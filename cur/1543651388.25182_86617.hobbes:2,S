hello,
i have a problem with my nfs-mounts on a dual-p2 350 Mhz system with kernel
2.4.19.
some times, when i transfer data over the network, the mount hangs and the
network-connection is ok.
all tries to kill the processes which use this mount failed.
i must reboot the pc.
same problem is, when a smb-mount (connect-program terminates without
umount) dies where it is in use.
the i have a mount, which doesn't funktion and all programs which acces this
mount hangs for all time.
goodby
