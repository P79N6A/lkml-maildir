Hahaha, dude, you have hyper-threading!  Each of your Xeons has two
logical processors that share most processor resources but implement two
independent pipelines.  So you have four schedulable processors in
total.
Google around for hyper-threading, HT, and SMT.  It is in all P4-class
Xeons and soon all regular P4s.
