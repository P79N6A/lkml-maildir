Dave, there is a set of patches in -mm that may handle this
better -
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.16-rc5/2.6.16-rc5-mm2/broken-out/rcu-batch-tuning.patch
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.16-rc5/2.6.16-rc5-mm2/broken-out/fix-file-counting.patch
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.16-rc5/2.6.16-rc5-mm2/broken-out/fix-file-counting-fixes.patch
Could you please try this in your setup ?
The rcu-batch tuning patch provides automatic switching to
process as many RCUs as possible if too many of them are queued.
The file counting fixes count the file structures correctly.
Thanks
Dipankar
