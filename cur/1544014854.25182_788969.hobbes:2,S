Exactly right. I needed it to tell the U-Boot bootloader to tftp the
kernel and boot the board. These boards don't keep their PCI settings
(assigned by the BIOS at boot) over a soft or hard reset.
I couldn't think of a better way to get them started.

Sorry, I'll add something about it.

I've had a really hard time understanding the virtio code. I haven't
been able to find much in the way of documentation for it. Can you point
me to some code that does anything vaguely similar to what you are
suggesting?
Arnd Bergmann said that there is a similar driver (for different
hardware) that uses virtio, but it is very slow, because it doesn't use
the DMA controller to transfer data. I need at very minimum 40MB/sec of
client -> host data transfer.
Thanks for the comments,
