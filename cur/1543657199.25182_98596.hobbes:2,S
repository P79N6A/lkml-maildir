How can you guarantee that you are sampling noise, though, what if a
sound card was picking up 50 Hz mains hum, for example,  that would
de-randomise the data quite a bit.

I have never understood how a 16-bit DAC or ADC can have noise above
96 dB.  Surely _by definition_ a 16-bit DAC or ADC is one that does
not have noise above that level.
