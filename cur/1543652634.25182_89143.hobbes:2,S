Yeah, openSSI approach has some advantages, but how about the other side,
how are the devices and files being handled?  isn't it wrong to run
someone elses process when the data that he is supposed to provide is
missing?  My work is based on a workstation model where all the nodes are
independent workstations (in most cases with similar configurations, as in
a computer laboratory at a university).  One of my major constraints is
that the system should be binary compatible with the kernel that does not
support my model. In my case i plan packing and restarting a process when
the creation node goes down.
