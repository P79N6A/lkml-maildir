Err... no it doesn't.  verify_cis_cache() is called from exactly one
place which is not in the list of functions here.  I do not understand
how this recursion checking is being done but there's something weird
going on.  set_cis_map() does not call any function on this list.  I
think set_cis_map() should be setup_cis_mem().

Isn't that a bit strong a statement?
The semantics of the code goes like this.  read_cis_mem() checks to
see if something has been done.  If it hasn't been done, it leads to
validate_mem() which first does that thing, and then does some stuff
that leads to read_cis_mem() being called again.  When read_cis_mem()
is reentered, it is guaranteed that the condition for recursion does
not exist.
Is that so complex as to be incomprehensible by a mere human?  To
remove the apparent recursion seems to me to require duplicating a
fairly long code path, which is why I did it this way in the first
place.  The stack usage of this code path is definitely something that
should be (and can be easily) fixed.
