Yes.  For example: a high priority task may be waiting for some IO to
come in. Right after the normal timer interrupt scheduled another task,
the IO may come in and wake the high priority process up. This process
will preempt the other task right away. (ie. less than 1 ms).

Well, 1) is true, but you can also increase HZ over 1000 if you like,
but that will usually cause more overhead, since, although a schedule
may not take place every HZ, a timer interrupt will.
