   Sorry, I still don't get it.  If the flush_cache_page is doing something
   necessary, then won't a user access in between it and invalidating pte
   undo what was necessary?  And if it's not necessary, why do we do it?
   (For better performance would be a very good reason.)
   
If there are other writable mappings of the page, we can't swap
it out legally.
