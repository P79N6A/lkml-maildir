Well, he did do this:
@@ -413,11 +412,11 @@ struct page *find_trylock_page(struct ad
 {
        struct page *page;
 
-       spin_lock(&mapping->page_lock);
+       spin_lock_irq(&mapping->tree_lock);
        page = radix_tree_lookup(&mapping->page_tree, offset);
        if (page && TestSetPageLocked(page))
                page = NULL;
-       spin_unlock(&mapping->page_lock);
+       spin_unlock_irq(&mapping->tree_lock);
        return page;
 }
Which would stop it appearing in readprofile. But why spinlock inlining
should affect that one way or the other is beyond me. I'll see about
using oprofile, but it's not a trivial conversion (it's all scripted).
There's no other occurences of that in his patchset. But you're right,
only xfs, and free_swap_and_cache seem to use it, and I'm not swapping.
