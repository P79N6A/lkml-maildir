Of course they will.  compat_u64 will have no effect on a properly
designed interface where everything is aligned.
To me, the whole point with compat_u64 is that when someone has designed
an interface improperly (so it's alignment-dependent) then we can
replace u64 with compat_u64 and use the same structure on 64 bits even
though the original interface was broken.
