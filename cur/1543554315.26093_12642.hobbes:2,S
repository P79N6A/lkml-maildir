Only ancient Linux kernels (2.2.x and earlier) had the limitation on how
many processes you can create. This was due to the fact that we used a
segment (or two -- LDT + TSS) per each process. Nowadays we only need such
per engine -- thus we cannot have more than about 2000 engines on an IA32
system.
Anyway, NR_TASKS is no more -- you can have as many tasks as you like --
unlimited. (i.e. limited only by about 32k which is the maximum PID, but
that surely ought to be enough for everyone...)
The default limit is the 0.25 * physpages but you can change that easily
by:
echo 100000 > /proc/sys/threads-max
(haven't you read LKI -- it explains you how to do it:
