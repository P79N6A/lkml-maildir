well anyone with an amd64 qualifies.. old apps work for me.
(fwiw FC1 and FC2 already run without the stack being executable if you use
the default distro kernel even on "traditional" x86 cpus, via the segment limit hack)

I know that in a FC1 full install there are less than 5 binaries that don't
run with NX. (one uses nested functions in C and passes function pointers to
the inner function around which causes gcc to emit a stack trampoline, and
gcc then marks the binary as non-NX, the others have asm in them that we
didn't fix in time to be properly marked).
