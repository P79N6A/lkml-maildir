Yes, but almost all files in arch/x86/kernel/cpu/ depend on
CONFIG_X86_32.
Here is an example for similiar implementations:
arch/x86/kernel/cpu/amd.c:static void __cpuinit init_amd(struct cpuinfo_x86 *c)
arch/x86/kernel/setup_64.c:static void __cpuinit init_amd(struct cpuinfo_x86 *c)
The question is, will there be a CPU specific file such as amd.c?
