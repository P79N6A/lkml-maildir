       Hi,
       I'm having trouble with TCP sockets freezing with 59368 bytes
in the Send-Queue in one server. I've tried kernels from 2.2.12 to 2.2.14
on both hosts and the problem continues.
       netstat shows Recv-Q = 0, and Send-Q = 59368 for all connections
frozen on server A and both queues = 0 on server B (both sides shows a
state ESTABLISHED for the connections).
       I've tested smtp and ftp, and the lock occurs at the same byte,
but only sending from A to B. Everything works fine from B to A, but if
something sends more than 100KB (+-) from A to B the problem occurs.
The two machines are web, ftp, proxy, mail, DNS and SSH servers working
very fine for many Linux and windows clients, except for those TCP
connections sending "many bytes" from server A to server B.
       It's very dificult to trace the problem because of the network
traffic, so I'd like very much if someone help me with this.
       Thank's,
               Vitor.
