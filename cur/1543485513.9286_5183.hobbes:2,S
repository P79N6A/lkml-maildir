This problem was not present in 2.1.132!
I'm sorry to submit a bug report with somewhat limited information on
this problem, but I wanted to get something out ASAP.  I was also
hoping it was a known problem.... :)
I have a rather large program that has a select() call waiting on
information from a socket.  I have a very small server program that
servers this information.  When I connect to the smaller server with
telnet or any other small client program it works just fine.  However,
the select() call in the larger program never returns even though the
send() call came back 100% successful in the small server.  I didn't
write the larger program so it's possiable that it's doing something
fancier like setting IP socket options.
 * This problem occurs with linux-2.2.0 & linux-2.2.1-ac5.
 * This problem is NOT present in linux-2.1.132.
 * I haven't tired the kernels in between (namely the pre-2.2)
Having un-reliable TCP/IP socket and/or select() stuff seems like "A
really bad thing".  I've double checked that I've upgraded all the
necessary packages and it seems I have.  The fact that it works in
linux-2.1.132 makes me really think it's a kernel problem.
If this is not a known problem.  I will gladly do any debugging,
including trying every kernel in between to find which one "broke".
	Any Ideas?
	Thanks,
	Rick Niles.
