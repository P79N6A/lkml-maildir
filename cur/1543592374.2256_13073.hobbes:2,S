Ugh.
The above is just horrible.
It doesn't fix any problems, it is only an ugly work-around for a
situation that never happens in real life. An application that only
re-reads the data that it just wrote itself is a _stupid_ application, and
I'm absolutely not interested in having a new interface that is useless
for everything _but_ such a stupid application.
