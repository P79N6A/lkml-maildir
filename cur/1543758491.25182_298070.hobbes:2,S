Yes, it may help - can you boot with profile=schedule and get
the results for say, a 30 second period while the application
is experiencing problems?
So:
start application
wait till it hits slowdown
readprofile -r ; sleep 30 ; readprofile > schedprof.out
and send schedprof.out, please?
Thanks,
Nick
