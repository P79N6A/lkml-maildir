Yes, sort of: <

There weren't any replies, unfortunately.  Do you think a repost would
make sense?
Our subsequent debugging revealed that either all the cards in our
sample were simply broken (but they seemed to work just fine with the
driver from FreeBSD-current), or something related to the DMA handling
in the driver was not quite right.  It looked as if the kernel and the
NIC couldn't agree on the contents of the ring buffer.
