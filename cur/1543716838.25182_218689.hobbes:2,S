It is very easy to define for 99.999% of all keyboards, which start
off connected and stay connected.
This should be simple.  I want to load a driver at boot time and wait
until it either binds to something or fails to do so.  If the user is
adding or removing hardware while the module is loading, I simply do
not care what the system does.  But if the hardware is not changing, I
care a great deal...  And the latter case is perfectly well-defined.

I suppose this would solve my USB keyboard problem.  But a) it seems
very complex for such a simple need; and b) it does not work for
non-USB devices, which are also causing me grief.
