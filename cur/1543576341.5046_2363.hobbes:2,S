Is strtoul actually used in the kernel other than for the occasional
(rare) write to /proc/sys and parsing boot options?

Perhaps I am mistaken but I'd expect it to be called what, ten times at
boot time, and a couple of times when X loads the MTRRs?
Sounds like the neatest trick would be reducing bytes used here...
