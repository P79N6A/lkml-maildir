I already have a patch that throttles AT keyboard when switching LED
state. However there is another problem - i8042's interrupt hanler is
racing with panic_blink polling the keyboar controller and they both
don;t quite like that.

I was thinking about something like the atached (untested and sorry
for using attachment). It shoudl blink just one led (numLock) on any
keyboard that has such LED (and allows to control it).
