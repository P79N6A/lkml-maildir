Subject: [PATCH] CPUSETS: add mems to basic usage documentation
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

It seems that there must be at least one node in mems
and at least one CPU in cpus in order to be able to assign
tasks to a cpuset. This makes sense. And I think it would
also make sense to include a mems setting in the basic usage
section of the documentation.
I also wonder if something logged to dmsg, explaining why
a write failed, would be a good enhancement. I ended up having
rummage arround in cpuset.c in order to work out why my 
configuration was failing.

 Add some cpus:

 Now attach your shell to this cpuset:
