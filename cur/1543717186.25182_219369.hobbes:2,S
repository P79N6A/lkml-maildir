Well, if you leave the create and unlink up to the application and
simply pass open filedescriptors to copyfile... But then it would be
equivalent to your new sendfile.
Copyfile can trivially be implemented in libc. I don't see why it would
have to be a system call. If a network filesystem wants to optimize the
file copying it could do this based on the sendfile data. If source and
destination are within the same filesystem and we're copying the whole
file starting at offset 0, send a copyfile RPC.
