If this platform can have PCI stuff hotplugged, then this is a problem.
If it's fixed then it isn't - PCI IRQ routing will only be used at boot
time.  IOW, whether such a thing is a problem is conditional on the
hardware/configuration which I'm not aware of.
Something for Andrew Victor to comment on.

Don't care about the PCMCIA crappy SA11x0 or PXA drivers anymore since
they never got converted to a reasonable device model.  As long as they
work functionally (which they do.)  Fixing it without breaking stuff is
too big a job for one person, so I'll just ignore this one.

This one looks quite bogus.  sa1110_mb_disable() is marked __init, and
it's called from neponset_init() which is also marked __init.

No reference to 'devices' (marked __initdata) in neponset_resume but there
is in neponset_init(), which is the only reference to it, and it is marked
__init.  Another false positive?

 (between 's3c2410_dma_add' and 's3c2410_pm_add')
Don't know enough about s3c stuff, but this one looks like a false positive
as well - it's registering a sysdev driver at boot time, and the class
and sysdev is only ever also registered at boot time and never unregistered.
Adding __init to s3c2410_dma_add would probably be the right thing to do
but will move the problem to be a reference to s3c2410_dma_add from
s3c2410_dma_driver instead.
Once that's done, might need an annotation of some sort?  Not sure.

This one is probably a real oops waiting to happen - if VFP hardware
isn't found and userspace tries to issue a VFP instruction, it could
oops the kernel.  Will fix (though the fix is rather more in-depth
than just removing __INIT.)
