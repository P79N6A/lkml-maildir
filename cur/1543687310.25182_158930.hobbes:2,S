Maybe I'm missing something -- I'm not sure what exactly you're including
in the models -- but wouldn't it be possible to implement the "host 
ownership" model so that it would STILL honor any RFC out there (and 
similarly for "interface ownership")?
For example, many IETF documents may state things like:
                                                                     The
   Home Agents List MAY be implemented in any manner consistent with the
   external behavior described in this document.
.. which *seems* (without knowing which RFCs and sections of them you 
refer to for justifying host/interface ownership) to be a probable intent 
of allowing either model.  Just as long as the external behaviour is 
consistent, you can implement it with any internal structure you wish.
