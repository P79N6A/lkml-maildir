Personally, I'd just leave it at the default no high-mem option.
The kernel will then be able to 'see' about 960MB of the memory, so you loose
about 64MB of it, but it's not worth the kernel using bounce-buffers etc just so
you can get 64MB more memory.
IIRC there was a 2GB patch that just redefined PAGE_OFFSET or something similar,
this means that you could see all the memory, but the max virtual memory a
process could see would be 2 gig (as opposed to 3 gig with the default).
