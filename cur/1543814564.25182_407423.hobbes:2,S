Given that someone has already determined that installing a safety valve
for RT tasks was worth while, and given that there is practically no
difference between a nice -20 and the lowest RT priority, seems to me
that extending that safety valve to cover reniced tasks is the
obviously-correct thing to do.  I think you should submit a patch.
