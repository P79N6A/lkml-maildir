It did not. The previous behaviour was to always silently override the
user mount options.

This is _not_ a kernel policy decision. The kernel is simply informing
the user that it cannot fulfil the mount request as specified. Exactly
why do you think that NFS should be any different from other filesystems
when it comes to this?
AFAIK, every other filesystem will give you an EBUSY if you try to mount
a partition with -oro if you are already mounting somewhere else with
-orw. Every filesystem will give you an EBUSY if you try to mount the
partition with -oacl if it is mounted somewhere else with -onoacl. The
reason: exactly the same as NFS, the caches cannot remain consistent
when you try to mount two different super blocks that both refer to the
same underlying filesystem.
