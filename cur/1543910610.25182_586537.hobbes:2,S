Have you tried "umount -l"?   How far is that from your requirements?
Alternately:
   mount --move /problem/path /somewhere/else
   umount -f /somewhere/else
   umount -l /somewhere/else
might be a little closer to what you want.
Though I agree that it would be nice if we could convince all
subsequent requests to a server to fail EIO instead of just the
currently active ones.  I'm not sure that just changing "umount -f" is
the right interface though....  Maybe if all the server handles
appeared in sysfs and have an attribute which you could set to cause
all requests to fail...
