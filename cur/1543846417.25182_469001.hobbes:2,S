No it's not.
kernel_fpu_begin() has the _one_ test that matters:
	if (thread->status & TS_USEDFPU) {
since if software emulation is on, nobody will ever have the TS_USEDFPU 
flag set.

No. It's all fixed properly already.
The bug is simply on the newer FXSR paths - marking the FPU emulation 
broken is just stupid.
