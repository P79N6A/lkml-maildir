Whenever I try to use the trident driver from the recent 2.3s w/ my
Hoontech NX card, it blocks in __down (arch/i386/kernel/semaphore.c).
This has happened on each version I've tested since trident.c was
added.
The box remains usable, so it must be spinning in the for(;;) loop.
I'm running an M686 SMP kernel, NOHIGHMEM.  Trident and soundcore are
modules.  Full config available on request.
Everything else (except the /proc/PID/cpu typo) works well.
I've not tried ALSA yet w/ 2.3.34, but with 2.3.33 is also blocked (I
presume TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE was alsa set and left on but I did not
look too closely until now).
