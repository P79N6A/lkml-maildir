One final comment:  Can you implement a persistent device naming scheme
using devfs today?  If so, please show me how you would:
	- always name a USB printer the same /dev name no matter when it
	  is discovered by the USB core (before or after any other USB
	  printer.)
	- always name your SCSI disk the same /dev name no matter where
	  in the scsi probe sequence it is (yank it out and plug it into
	  another place in your scsi rack.)
This is the main problem that udev solves.  The fact that it also gives
you a dynamic /dev is just extra goodness.
thanks,
