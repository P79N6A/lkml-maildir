Steve,
here are two patches with intention to clean too indented
code. Also small fix in memcmp usage. And there is still
possible NULL pointer deref in CIFSNTLMSSPNegotiateSessSetup
if kzalloc fails - but I'm not sure how to properly hanlde that.
Any comments are welcome (the patches are over today Linus's git)
