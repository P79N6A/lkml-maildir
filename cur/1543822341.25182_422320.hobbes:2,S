Ah, then I better describe it.  The patch makes it possible to recover
from an insufficient amount of bootmem during swiotlb_init (instead of
panicing).  For x86_64, I have it bailing out (via the returned int from
swiotlb_init and using the non-iommu DMA routines from
arch/x86_64/kernel/pci-nommu.c).  For ia64, its not that simple.
There are no alternative DMA routines to switch to incase of an error.
Also, There is no way to "bail-out" from its mem_init.  I could add a
panic there, if that is more palatable.
Thanks,
Jon
