For a one off test you can brute force it with the plain old renice(8).
Or (depending on which kernel you're using -- Con changed this post
2.6.10) you can apply a patch like:
diff -Nru a/kernel/workqueue.c b/kernel/workqueue.c

Yup, not forgotten ;-)

Yes there is.  We've made other rlimits changes in 2.6, and this one isn't
that invasive.  The main issues are:  getting semantics right, making sure
it actually solves the problem, making sure it keeps sane defaults (not
creating some new ugly hole), and making sure it's in step with the Grand
Plan (TM).  None of these issues are showstoppers, all quite workable.
