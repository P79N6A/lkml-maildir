I don't know if linux-raid mailing list is still active, the archive
sites look very old...
So, to raid developers in this mailing list, 
Is there any documentation out there about the different raid 5 syncing
algorithm? 
Raidtab's man page tells about left/right (a)synchronous algorithm, but
doesn't tell how they differ.
I couldn't find any howto pages that explain this either.
