ECC errors get corrected in the drive, so it would be surprising if 
the cable had an effect. Do you have reason to think that's 
happening? That is, if you swap the drives on the cable, do the 
errors stick with the cable position, or the physical drive? I'd 
expect the latter, and if so would retire the drive.
