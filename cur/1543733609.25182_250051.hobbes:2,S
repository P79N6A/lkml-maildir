Can't we do everything in the CPU_UP_ONLINE case though?
One other thing:
void __init sched_init_smp(void)
 {
+	lock_cpu_hotplug();
 	arch_init_sched_domains(cpu_online_map);
 	sched_domain_debug();
+	unlock_cpu_hotplug();
+
+	hotcpu_notifier(update_sched_domains, 0);
 }
Do you have a theoretical race here? Can we hotplug a CPU before the notifier
is registered? (I know we *can't* because it is still earlyish boot).
Can you move hotcpu_notifier under the cpu_hotplug lock? Seems not because
register_cpu_notifier takes the lock itself. Seems like a flaw in the API to
me. Probably the notifier chain should be protected by a lock that nests
inside the cpucontrol lock. Rusty?
