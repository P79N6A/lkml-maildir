Thanks a lot for this alert, Andrea, much appreciated.
Although the 2.6.7 code looks rather different here (vma_merge now does
all mprotect's merging too), and there's a couple of reasons it's harder
to see the problem with mainline (because fork's copy_page_range uses the
quick page_dup_rmap inline, skipping the BUG_ONs in page_add_anon_rmap;
and because anon_vma_prepare is likely to correct the situation by taking
anon_vma from neighbouring vma later), I missed exactly the same point
and we do indeed need a patch for it.

I hope you've not found somewhere the vm_private_data change is actually
needed - because when using that field for the non-linear swapout cursor,
the test in is_mergeable_vma prevented non-linear merges, it seemed a
superfluous test to me, and so I simply removed it.  I say superfluous
because those few vmas which set vm_private_data are already prevented
from merging by VM_SPECIAL flags tests.

That's fine, yes, I've now done the patch, will post it separately now.
Thanks again,
Hugh
