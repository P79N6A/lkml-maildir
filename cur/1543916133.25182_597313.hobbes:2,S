As much as I'd love to see markers as soon as possible I have to agree.
I really hate how the first post of a handfull easy patches touching
almost no core code has turned into this gigantic series.
Matthew, any chance you could resurrect a trivial, no-optimizations
marker variant that has so little impact it could go into 2.6.24?
I'd really love to have the infrastructure there so we can add optimizations
in parallel with actually adding the users to the tree.
