Subject: PPP problems in 2.4.19-20, modem freezes

Hello,
I'm running leased line between two 28.8k external modems, with pppd 2.4.1.
After upgrading kernel to 2.4.19, i've experienced modem freezes - when the
connection dies and modem (the one switched to recieve) hangs up, sometimes it 'freezes', not reacting at any inputs from terminal program/pppd, emiting weird
signal to the line (that tone you got when the line is aborted while
handshaking, but this time it won't time out). Killing pppd or even
rebooting the machine doesn't help, i must manually cycle the modem to start working again.
With older kernels (2.4.16) it works fine. Any ideas ?
Please CC replies to me, as i'm not on the list.
Thanks, Jan
