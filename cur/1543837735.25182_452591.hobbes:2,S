Subject: [PATCH for review] [58/145] x86_64: AUX_DEVICE_INFO is one byte long, use 'movb'

Bugzilla #6552 says:
"In arch/i386/boot/setup.S, movw is used instead of movb for PS/2 mouse
information, although it is unsigned char. This does not harm, because
the jmp instruction overwritten by movw is used before executing movw,
and never be used again"
I've no idea if this is a real bug or how it gets fixed, so I'm submitting
it for review instead of letting it die of boredom in bugzilla. Aditionally
to i386, I've changed x86-64, which mirrors the same code.
Credits to Yoshinori K. Okuji, who found the problem and suggested a fix.
