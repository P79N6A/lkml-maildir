note that I was only commenting on the issue of making system calls and
*NOT* on the specific case of mknod-ing from the kernel.
The idea that a UNIX kernel should have *any* dealings with
manipulating files by their filenames is absolutely
unacceptable, except when it is *really* needed e.g. execing "/sbin/init"
or "/sbin/modprobe" (or the value in proc) to do things.
Apart from well-defined cases when there is no other way (or no other
perfect way), polluting the kernel with opening files by name, mknoding
devices etc etc is a bad thing.
