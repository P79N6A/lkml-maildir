We have an interface to disable oom for the process already :)
But I could agree that it could be a good idea to have an interface
to provide a list of names or whatever else to select what user knows
and works with to be killed first/last

Using oom_adj? Because there is no way I can determine which number to
put there. It is not even documented for those who do not read kernel
sources. Even after that: oom_score changes with time, and having 1/2 or
8 oom_adj is correct right now, it will not be in a few moments.
Having containers is a bit overkill to determine which one to kill,
especially when several sets of processes are created from the same
parent :)

It is up to the user to decide what he wants to be checked first.
Only user knows what he runs.

Almost. But I can not if tasks are spawned from the parent process. We
can not change the process to adjust its forked children to have
different adjustment and can not change it for the process itself, since
it should live and children should be dead.
