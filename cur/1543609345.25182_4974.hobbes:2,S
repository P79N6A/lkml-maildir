Alan:
Good idea.. I actually would like to be scientific about it by sticking
to the kernel that the machines came with, and just trying the VIA Athlon
workaroung pci quirk on those kernels... that way I can experiment and see
if it makes much of a difference.
I suppose this question is stuff I can find elsewhere but: where do I find
just that patch alone (so that I cen see about adapting it to my redhat
kernel) and/or how do I do it from userspace ;) (i assume i just have to
write to some registers or something using some user-space mechanism that
i am unaware of???).
