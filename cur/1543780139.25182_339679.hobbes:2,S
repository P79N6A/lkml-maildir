This doesn't happen, or if it does, it happens far less often than
genuine crashes. This can only happen when netpoll's burned through
its entire pool of SKBs in a single interrupt and the card never
releases them, despite repeated prodding. In other words, you'll get
most of a dump out of the box, but you're probably screwed no matter
what you do.
Also note that _any_ printk can be the kernel's dying breath. This is
why for both serial and video we do polled I/O to be sure we actually
get our message out. Netconsole is no different.

Why, pray tell, do you think there will be a second chance after
re-enabling interrupts? How does this work when we're panicking or
oopsing where we most care? How does this work when the netpoll client
is the kernel debugger and the machine is completely stopped because
we're tracing it?
As for busy loops, let me direct you to the "poll" part of the name.
It is in fact the whole point.

Yes, there may be another console, but we should by no means depend on
that being the case. We should in fact assume it's not.

Let me be more precise. I've seen it in the middle of an oops dump,
where it complained, then made further progress, and then died. In
other words, the code works. And I've since upped the pool size.
