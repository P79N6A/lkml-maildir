I haven't tried the vsyscall patch, but there was a sysenter patch
floating around that I tried. It reduced the syscall overhead with 1/3
to 1/4, but I never tried it on P4.
FYI: Just note that I say overhead, which I assume to be the time it
take to do someting like getpid(), write(-1,...), select(-1, ...) (etc
that is immediatlely returned with -EINVAL by the kernel). 
Since the kernel do execute a quite afew instructions beside the
int/iret sysenter/sysexit, it's an assumption that the int 80  is the
culprit. 
I would be nice if someone bothered to try this on an windoze box.
(Un)fortunatly I live in a windoze free environment. :-)

    Just out of interest, how much would sysenter (or syscall on amd) cost,
    then? (Supposing it can be feasibly implemented.)
    
    I think I heard WinXP (W2k too?) is using sysenter?
