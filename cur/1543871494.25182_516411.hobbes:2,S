with the big freaking difference that the 5 parallel implementations of 
inode->i_op are:
	_internal to Linux_
Doh. There's only a data ABI underneath them.
every time someone tried to impose a functional/behavioral ABI on core 
bits of Linux we said: 'no way dude!'. Remember STREAMS? Remember the 
module KABI? Remember ACPI? [doh, i guess we messed up on the latter 
one. We regret that day ever since.]
(network file systems are a bit of an exception to the rule, but those 
are pretty isolated themselves and in no way as wide and central as the 
direction paravirt_ops appears to grow.)

again, those are /DATA/ ABIs. Not function ABIs. Not behavioral ABIs. 
The coupling is /FAR/ saner and far more plannable and far more 
isolated. And even data ABIs are very non-trivial ...
