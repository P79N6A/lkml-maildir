Or, even better, use an inline function instead of a macro whereever
possible.
One more thing, the description for patch 1 can probably be refined
a bit more and put into Documentation/somewhere as a new file.
Regarding the split of the patch, it's usually a bad idea to 
put the header file into a separate patch from its users.
E.g. if someone during debugging tries to revert patch 2 but not
patch 1, he ends up with a broken build.
