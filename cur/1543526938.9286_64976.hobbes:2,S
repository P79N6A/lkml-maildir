I tried to localize the problem more exactly in slightly different way:
	grepped net subdirectory for TASK_RUNNING and inserted checks where
	needed (not so much places to change, of course only files that are 
	compiled at all)
Result:
	I got first failures of test at end of procedure tcp_recvmsg() (and of
	course later as current->state is changed). 
Only difference I saw is that other procedures under linux/net directory which
changes current->state at first sets 
	current->state = TASK_RUNNING
and only after that calls remove_waut_queue().
tcp_recvmsg() does this in an opposite way. (and it was only place where I
found corruption). So maybe there could be some race condition and sometime task
state may become corrupted
I'll try to change order and continue testing.
