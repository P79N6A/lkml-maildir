Hi Petr,

> 0x295-0x296, instead of full 0x290-0x297 range.  While some other sensors
> chips respond to all addresses in 0x290-0x297 range, Winbond chips respond
> to 0x295-0x296 only (this behavior is implied by documentation, and matches
> behavior observed on real systems).  This is not problem alone, as no
> BIOS was found to put something at these unused addresses, and sensors
> chip itself provides nothing there as well.
> 
> But in addition to only respond to these two addresses, also BIOS vendors 
> report in their ACPI-PnP structures that there is some resource at I/O 
> address 0x295 of length 2.  And when later this hwmon driver attempts to
> request region with base 0x290/length 8, it fails as one request_region
> cannot span more than one device.
> 
> Due to this we have to ask only for region this hardware really occupies,
> otherwise driver cannot be loaded on systems with ACPI-PnP enabled.

OK, looks good, applied to my local tree. I'll push it to Greg KH in a
week or so. Thanks.
