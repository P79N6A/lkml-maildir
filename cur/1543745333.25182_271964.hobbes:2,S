Subject: [via-rhine.c] bug since 2.6.9 with wake-on-lan ability?

Hello all,
I recently updated from kernel 2.6.7 to 2.6.9 and experienced that wake-on-lan 
with my VIA-Rhine II network controller does not work anymore. The system 
doesn't start up if it gets a magic packet.
I am using a mainbaord with KT-600 chipset made by VIA (ECS Elitegroup 
KT-600A) with an integrated VIA VT6102 network controller into the VT8237 
southbridge.
I saw there were different changes from 2.6.7 to 2.6.9 in via-rhine.c like 
code cleanups and redesign and so on. At the moment I try to track this 
behaviour down in order to create a patch.
I searched the lkml for any articles about this but I could not find any. 
That's why I am posting... Maybe anyone knows something about that?
Regards
Sven
