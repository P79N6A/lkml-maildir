for Samba, the use of sys_mark_dir_clean() & O_CLEAN would be that it
could fully cache all namespace data in user-space (as it already does),
and could assume that the userspace cache is uptodate and ensure that a
particular name does not exist - under whatever namespace rules it wants
to use.
create(O_CLEAN) will return with -EFLUSH if this assumption is not true
anymore - in which case it can re-read that directory.
this way the fastpath would not involve any readdir() calls at all -
even in a mixed environment.
