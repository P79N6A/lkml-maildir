Alan,
One more thing.  I was able to reproduce it once during an initial powerup
sequence by putzing with the mouse buttons while the auto-detection was going
on (generating interrupts?).  I am wondering if the problem in in the way 
interrupts are being handled for the mouse.  If I leave the mouse alone 
it seems to get autodetected properly.
