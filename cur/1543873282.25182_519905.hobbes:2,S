Hi.
I have a problem with 3c59x network driver. After some time (now it happened 
after 6 days of uptime) the card stops transmitting packets. Interrupt 
counter increments, the card recieves and trasmits some buffers, but the 
more time, the less packets are trasmitted and in the end it stops 
trasmitting at all. I don't know how to debug this, rmmod and modprobe of 
the module back helps to solve this for some time.
What kind of info should I post and how to track this nasty thing down? 
Note, that this is server and hence things like bisecting is no-go for me.

I know, that I have disabled APIC, I noted it yesterday and rebuilt the 
kernel with the APIC support, but still didn't reboot. If this is required 
I'll do so, but before that, there was running smp kernel and that kind of 
hangs appeared too.
There is nothing significant in dmesg, 2.6.17-rc5 was fine, so this is 
definitely a regression.
thanks,
