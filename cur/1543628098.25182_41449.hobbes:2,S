Oh, please show me how and I will do it gladly.  I just don't know how to
make diff+patch do that.

You got that right.

However, first I personally do not want to start that project.  Firstly, I
do personally like Larry and do not want to be part of a horde bent on
tearing down his business.  There are after all, plenty of genuinely nasty
things out there to attack, attacking Larry as *way* down my list.  More
importantly, my time is better spent improving Linux.

That's the point.  It is not fun to see the whole thing start tearing itself
apart.  Fun is being on the winning side.  Fun is not dealing with a lot of
stressed out people with agendas.

I use it too.  I do not think it belongs in the tree, especially not with its
own directory.  My point, pure and simple.

But did you think it might be controversial?
