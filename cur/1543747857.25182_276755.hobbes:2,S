I bet Andrew is going to say the same thing... It just seems odd putting a 
prototype in a header for a function with one call site and gets freed 
after boot. Since i'll have to rediff, i'm also going to change the 
nonx_setup parameter type to const char * as suggested by someone in a 
private email.
Thanks,
