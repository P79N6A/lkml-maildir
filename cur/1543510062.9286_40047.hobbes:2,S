Hello all,
One of our production server is experiencing a very bad problem with
Apache. Configuration: Dual PII-400, 512 Mb ram, Apache 1.3.9, kernel
2.2.12.
The server is quite busy (25 req/s, load between 2 and 4). Every 10 or 15
minutes the server completely stops accepting new HTTP requests, I can see
the number of open TCP connections decrease from 1000 or more to a couple
of hundrends. The server itself if still responsive. The busy web site is
on a second IP, the main IP still accepts new connections. A stop/start of
apache immediately cures the problem. I have tried to compile Apache with
and without -DSINGLE_LISTEN_UNSERIALIZED_ACCEPT option, no noticeable
diffrence ...
Any ideas ?
Thanks.
