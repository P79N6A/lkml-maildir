It's possible that I'm too tired to have grasped this, but if I have,
you're all wet.  In all cases, read needs to return the number of bytes
successfully moved.  If you ask for N and 1/2 of the way through N you
are going to get a fault, and you return SEGFAULT, now how can I ever
find out that N/2 bytes actually made it out to me?  I want to know that.
If you are arguing that return N/2 is wrong, you are incorrect.
