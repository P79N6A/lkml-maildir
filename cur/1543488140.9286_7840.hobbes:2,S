Hello all.
Since Heinz is currently enjoying his trip to California
i would like to annonce the new LVM version 0.6.
Changes:
- Support for Linux 2.2.2
- The fixed limit of 8 volume groups with up to 31 logical
  volumes each is gone: You can have 1 volume group with up 
  to 256 logical volumes or 99 volume groups with 2 or 3 
  logical volumes each or any combination in between.
  See vgchange(8).
- Sizes can be specified with units now; for example you are 
  able to provide the logical volume size in megabytes, gigabytes 
  and terabytes 8*)
- Read ahead sectors now can be chooseen on a per logical
  volume base with lvcreate(8)/lvchange(8);
  no global setting with lvmchange(8) any longer
- new options s and n for pvscan(8)
- /proc/partitions fully supported with kernel 2.2.1 now
Additional information on Linux LVM is available at

Please note that LVM 0.6 is still considered alpha.
