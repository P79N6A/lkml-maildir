Absolutely, but now it has a dangling "{" that didn't get closed. So the 
above would definitely be more readable, it just doesn't actually work.
Unless you'd do the "end_for_each_cpu" define (to close the statement), 
and update the 300+ places that use this. Which might well be worth it.
So the subtle "break from the middle of a statement expression" was just a 
rather hacky way to avoid having to change all the users of this macro.
