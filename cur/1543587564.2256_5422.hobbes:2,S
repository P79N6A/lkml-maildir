OK, so it's not the RAID setup.  There's two things that can cause this.  
One is that DMA is turned off  (what does hdparm /dev/hda and hdparm 
/dev/hdc show?), the second was that the drives are on the same channel 
(which obviously isn't the case here).  Can you verify that the drives are 
in DMA mode?
