Subject: 2.2.18: Remove bogus "Wrong buffer length" warnings from aha1542

I've just installed an AHA1542 SCSI card, and when performing a backup,
I'm finding the kernel is spewing out the following message:
    Wrong buffer length supplied for request sense (256)
This is because the sense_buffer is 16 bytes, but the buffer supplied
is 256 bytes.
Looking at the 2.4 version of the driver, I see that this message has
been disabled, because scsi_request_sense() provides a buffer of size 256.
The following is a version of the 2.4 patch applied to 2.2.  Please apply.
I did notice that aha1740.c also has the same bogus check on the buffer,
but I haven't provided a patch, as this is still present in 2.4, and a
patch for that should also be included.
