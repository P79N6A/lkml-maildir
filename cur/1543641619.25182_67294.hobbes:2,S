So why couldn't this happen? This is what used to happen before, I don't 
see that consolidating the spinlock had any impact at all.
	CPU #0						CPU #1
	down()						up()
		lock decl (negative)
		__down()				lock incl
			spinlock()			__up()
			atomic_add_negative()
				success - break
			spinunlock();
		}					wake_up()
	return - semaphore is now invalid		spin_lock()
							BOOM!
The fact is, that as long as down() and up() avoid taking the spinlock 
_before_ they touch "count", they aren't synchronized. 
And we definitely do _not_ want to take the spinlock before we touch 
count, since that would make the fast path a lot slower.
What?
