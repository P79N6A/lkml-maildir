I hope, we can agree on this premise for further discussions

Whats too complex? Are you asserting that other people e.g. me, are too
dumb to understand that ?

There is everywhere a corner case. Thats nothing new.

I completely agree, but your statement just confirms Ebsen's request for
keeping those tweaks as configurable options rather than built in
defaults.
For any RT application the application dictates the constraints and
therefor requires a maximum of configurability.

We all do just with a different set of constraints, right ?
