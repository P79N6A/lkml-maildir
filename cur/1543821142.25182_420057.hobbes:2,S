But you can't twiddle relayfs with echo and cat; it's more suited to  
high-bandwidth transfers than anything else, no?  The idea here would  
be to be able to interact with the files in /sys the same way you  
always do, but provide a sort of consistency system whereby a program  
_or_ sysadmin can attach its view of the /sys/hypervisor directory  
tree to a particular snapshot of the system.  As far as I can tell  
(although I'd be happy to be proven wrong), there is no trivial way  
to manually access or shellscript relayfs files, the way you can  
"cat /sys/devices/<path-to-device>/dev".
Cheers,
