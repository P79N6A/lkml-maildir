Actually, it'd be worth trying drivers/rtc/rtc-ds1307.c ... the M41T00 is
one of a family of mostly-compatible RTC chips, and the ds1307 driver
should be pretty much the least-common-denominator there.  They all use
the same I2C address, and the same register layout for the calendar/time
function.
I'd expect rtc-ds1307 to handle the m41t00 already, or with at most minor
tweaks to recognize whatever's different.  It should already be ignoring
the bits in the clock/calendar registers that vary, as well as the SRAM
and (for some other chips) the alarm.  (Not that I2C has ways to tell us
what IRQ the alarm would use, but that's a different tale!)
