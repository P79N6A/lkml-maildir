Are there any plans of implementing sendfile64() or sendfile() support for 
-D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64?
(from man 2 sendfile)
ssize_t sendfile(int out_fd, int in_fd, off_t *offset, size_t count);
int main() {
        ssize_t s1;
        size_t count;
        off_t offset;
        printf("sizeof ssize_t: %d\n", sizeof s1);
        printf("sizeof size_t: %d\n", sizeof count);
        printf("sizeof off_t: %d\n", sizeof offset);
        return 0;
}
$ make
...
$ ./sendfile_test
sizeof ssize_t: 4
sizeof size_t: 4
sizeof off_t: 4
$ 
and - when attempting to build this with -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 
[roy@roy-sin micro_httpd-O_DIRECT]$ make sendfile_test
gcc -D_DEBUG -Wall -W -D_GNU_SOURCE -D_NO_DIR_ACCESS -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 
-D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE -DUSE_O_DIRECT -DINETD -Wno-unused -O0 -ggdb -c 
sendfile_test.c
In file included from sendfile_test.c:1:
/usr/include/sys/sendfile.h:26: #error "<sys/sendfile.h> cannot be used with 
_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64"
make: *** [sendfile_test.o] Error 1
