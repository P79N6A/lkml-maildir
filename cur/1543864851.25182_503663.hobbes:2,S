(note: libata does *not* generate retries for medium errors;
 the looping is driven by the SCSI mid-layer code).

Or perhaps we could have the mid-layer always "early-exit"
without retries for "MEDIUM_ERROR", and still do retries for the rest.
When libata reports a MEDIUM_ERROR to us, we *know* it's non-recoverable,
as the drive itself has already done internal retries (libata uses the
"with retry" ATA opcodes for this).
But meanwhile, we still have the original issue too, where a single stray
bad sector can blow a system out of the water, because the mid-layer
currently aborts everything after it from a large merged request.
Thus the original patch from this thread.  :)
Cheers
