Subject: [PATCH] Input: document the proper usage of EV_KEY and KEY_UNKNOWN (v2)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

We have most of the pieces needed to have sane, generic userland keyboard
handling in place for a while now, but it is not sufficiently documented.
This patch documents the requirements and best practices for EV_KEY input
drivers.

 I have changed the KEY_UNKNOWN preference over positional keycodes around,
 and also added a small paragraph on the expected behaviour of userland
 applications re. EV_MSC MSC_SCAN events.

-1.9 Other event types, handling output events
+1.9 Being friendly to userspace when implementing EV_KEY drivers
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Input drivers that generate EV_KEY events should always support either
+dev->getkeycode()/dev->setkeycode(), or keycode, keycodemax and keycodesize,
+so as to allow userspace to reprogram the keycodes as needed.  They should
+also either always generate EV_MSC MSC_SCAN events along with every EV_KEY
+event, or special case EV_KEY KEY_UNKNOWN as described below.
+
+Userspace applications, on the other hand, should never try to remap keys by
+default based solely on EV_MSC MSC_SCAN if that event is part of an event
+block that contains an EV_KEY event other than EV_KEY KEY_UNKNOWN.
+
+If the input driver doesn't support any of the generic methods to manipulate
+the keycode map, it must never issue a EV_KEY KEY_UNKNOWN event.  If you
+need to issue EV_KEY KEY_UNKNOWN events, please implement the code in your
+driver to manipulate its keycode map.  KEY_UNKNOWN is meant to be something
+that can be replaced by the user with a functional keycode.
+
+If the input driver generates an EV_KEY KEY_UNKNOWN event, it should also
+generate *in the same event block* (i.e. before it issues an EV_SYN) an
+EV_MSC MSC_SCAN event, with the scan code for the "unknown key".  This
+should be done both in "press" and "release" EV_KEY events.  The EV_MSC
+MSC_SCAN event allows a generic userspace keyboard helper daemon to ask the
+user if he would like to map a key in a input device to a valid keycode, and
+assign a function to it.
+
+The scan code of a key (as informed in a EV_MSC MSC_SCAN event) must be its
+index in the keycode map, as implemented by dev->getkeycode() /
+dev->setkeycode(), or keycode, keycodemax and keycodesize for the device.
+
+If a key has a specific function that is known to the driver, it should
+generate the appropriate keycode for that function by default.  E.g., in a
+laptop where the FN+F1 key combination is always marked "HELP" in the
+keyboard, the driver is to generate KEY_HELP and not KEY_FN_F1.
+
+If a positional keycode for a key already exists in input.h (e.g. KEY_FN_F1
+for FN+F1), it should be used instead of KEY_UNKNOWN.  When such a code
+doesn't exist or doesn't make any sense for a key, EV_KEY KEY_UNKNOWN is to
+be used.
+
+Non-positional keycodes like KEY_PROG1 should never be used by default.
