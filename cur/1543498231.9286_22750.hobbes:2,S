The last several times I have built 2.2.9 and done a "make config" I
have been prompted with the question (and its huge commentary) on
whether to enable CONFIG_RTC or not.  This happens a dozen or more times
and appears to stop only when I've answered with "no" at least twice (or
maybe I just never had the patience to answer them all with "M", but
that seems to perpetuate the series).
Is there a fix for this?  It seems really odd.
