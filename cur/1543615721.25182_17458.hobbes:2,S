|    No, both the console and X need a VT.  As far as I can tell
| Linux only lets you have one VT active at any time.  You can
| have a different mouse and keyboard used by the console and
| by X (in theory at least), but I don't think that solves the
| mutual exclusivity of VTs.

|    Some people may have kernel hacks to allow this sort of
| thing, but I haven't been keeping track of this stuff.  It's
| not an area that I've been involved in.
Any idea? Basically I would like to run 2 monitor, one for X
and one for console paralell, with 1 keyboard/mouse.
Switching between them like with one monitor, but when no
work on the one, I would like to keep the signal on the
unused monitor, eg I would like to see the (not blank) screen.
