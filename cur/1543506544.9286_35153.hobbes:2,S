I am completely agree with this opinion, and I'd like to add one point.
Let's consider the situation we have two interfaces configured for
two different networks at the same host. Next, let  this host has to
operate as two different web-servers (rather typical situation), and the fact,
that this is really one physical host, must be hidden by
security reasons. I have two different ISPs and two different routes for
these two interfaces, and IP forwarding off. The configuration seems
secure... But if first interface will reply to ARP for interface 2 IP,
then, clearly, security will be completely broken.
More generally, the concept when IP address is assotiated with HOST, not
whith interface, contradicts with basic UNIX concept to have
HOST IP address 127.0.0.1, and others IP - the interface addresses.
As a result, it leads to numerous difficulties in complex routing/
firewalling/accounting situations.
