Yeah -- I was just making sure you weren't intending to pass the string
"MST" into the kernel for translation.  *Not* that I think *you* are
that stupid, of course, but some people on this thread have suggested
similar things.

And don't forget that it needs to be affected by "-o remount".  That
way a cron job can keep your legacy filesystem displaying data in the
right legacy way even when you don't reboot twice a year.  (In which
case you probably don't dual-boot and may well not need FAT at all, but
that's beside the point.)
