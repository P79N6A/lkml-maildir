   Sure, but if they were unified (that is what I understood what the original
   poster wanted to do) then they would be suddenly much more performance
   critical and need fine grained locking.
   
This can be made, if necessary.  If the toplevel flow cache lookup
table is sized appropriately, I doubt anything will be needed.
   
   P.S.: One big performance problem currently is ip_conntrack. It has a bad
   hash function and tends to have a too big working set (beyond cache size)
   Some tuning in this regard would help a lot of workloads.
   
This is well understood problem and a fix is in the works.
See the netfilter lists.
