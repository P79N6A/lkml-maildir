I just released a new version of libevent that supports Linux new
epoll mechanism; see
  
http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/
The page contains some performance comparisons for different event
notification mechanisms.
The library supports platform independent high performance network
applications.  It chooses the fastest notification mechansims
supported by the operating system.
