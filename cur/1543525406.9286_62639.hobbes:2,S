If your machine is dual-boot, try booting Windoze, then re-boot to
linux, and try again. This is the only way I have been able to get
sound to work on my Toshiba 730 laptop, probably since I switched to
the 2.2 kernels. If I reboot from linux to linux, all it does is make
ticking noises and give me the following in /var/log/messages. Do you
get any kernel messages?
Feb 11 12:07:35 tardis kernel: Sound: DMA (output) timed out - IRQ/DRQ config error? 
It's not a good solution, but it may narrow the problem down.
If anyone knows how to fix my problem, great. I'm using the CS4232
compiled as a module
alias char-major-14 cs4232
alias sound cs4232
alias midi opl3
options cs4232 io=0x534 irq=5 dma=1 dma2=0
options opl3 io=0x388
TIA
