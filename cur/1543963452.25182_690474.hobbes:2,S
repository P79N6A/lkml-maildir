Subject: [PATCH] x86: Remove 6 bank limitation in 64 bit MCE reporting code
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/5/8/412

Eliminate the 6 bank restriction in 64 bit mce reporting code. This restriction
is artificial (due to static creation of sysfs files) and 32 bit code
does not have any such restriction.
This change helps in reporting the details of machine checks on a machine check
exception with errors in bank 6 and above on CPUs that support those banks.
Without the patch, machine check errors in those banks are not reported.
We still have 128 (MCE_EXTENDED_BANK) bank restriction instead of max 256
supported in hardware. That is not changed in the patch below as it will have
some user level mcelog utility dependency, with bank 128 being used for
thermal reporting currently.
The patch below does not create sysfs control (bankNctl) for banks higher
than 6 as well. That needs some pre-cleanup in /sysfs mce layout, removal of
per cpu /sysfs entries for bankctl as they are really global system level
control today. That change will follow. This basic change is critical to
report the detailed errors on banks higher than 6.
