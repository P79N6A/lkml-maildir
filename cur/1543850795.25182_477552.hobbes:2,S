No. Paulo pointed that and I added a cache so the CPU is doesn't waste
much time. Less than 1% on a P4 3Ghz. The kernel do a lot more things,
not only refreshing the LCD.
The driver is not intended for an embedded system, as they usually
doesn't have a parallel port.

I had the write() and read() syscalls coded. People like Pavel didn't
like such behaviour, and he told me to recode it to be a framebuffer.
Please read other threads before telling it is wrong when other people
thought the opposite.

Well, I think it's better to split it. I have already given reasons to you.

Because mmaping is better than read() write() in any case. I know, it
waste a little more CPU, but get the point: If you only need to show
static images, the driver won't update the LCD (that is what really
waste the CPU time). If you really need performance, you can decrease
the refresh rate if you don't need it. But 20 Hz is useful for
everybody and doesn't waste a lot of time.
Also, if you want attach fbcon to the device, you need to refresh it
constantly to behave like a framebuffer device, so it is a
requirement.

No way. Please read previous threads. Greg KH doesn't want more ioctls
in any way. The first versions used it, and he told me to remove them.
Sorry.
