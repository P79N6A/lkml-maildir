I think it does. All the tricky stuff that David and Junio have been
discussing is actually done very transparently by
    git-rebase <upstream>
Now, git-rebase uses git-format-patch <options> | git-am <options> so
it sometimes has problems merging. In that case, you can choose to
either resolve the problem (see the doco for how to signal to git-am
that you've resolved a conflict) or to cancel the rebase. If you
choose to cancel the rebase, do
   cp .git/refs/heads/{<headname>,<headnamebadrebase>}
   cat .git/HEAD_ORIG > .git/refs/heads/<headname>
   git-reset --hard
   rm -fr .dotest
and you'll be back to where you started. Perhaps this could be rolled
into something like git-rebase --cancel to make it easier, but that's
about it. The toolchain definitely supports it.
cheers,
martin
