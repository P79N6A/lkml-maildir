Sometimes I do hold on to stuff for a little while because I don't think
it's quite ready yet, but that's not because I don't want it out there.
It's more of a "I don't feel like spending 1-2 hours making and testing
a -mm version", really. And if I just send you the vanilla patch for
something I know you have to massage to get to apply, a cloud of guilt
builds up over my head. With so many patches in -mm, I don't want to put
that extra strain on you.
