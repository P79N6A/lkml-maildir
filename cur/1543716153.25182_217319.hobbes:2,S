Yes, I also think the chip above 2nd PCI slot is the right one. You can 
see the realtek logo. It is only a ac97 codec (basically not more than a 
DAC and ADC) and linux currently only has drivers for this. The MCP-T 
has an APU, which could do dsp stuff by hardware, but no drivers still 
(Hello Nvidia?), so all of this is done via software. (THe APU has even 
more functionality, like DD5.1 realtime encoding, fx, and whatever). In 
our case, the APU shouldn't cause any troubles, as it is not used. With 
the APU, nforce2 chipset behaves like a "real" soundcard. Without, its 
sound abilities are not better than the average mainboard's onboard sound.
