(without having looked at the code) Code-wise, that sounds reasonable. 
Since you're talking about patches to a specific subsystem, it would be
better if you send a note directly to the maintainer and people who tend
to work on the code in addition to the linux-kernel mailing list.  Also,
given the volume of linux-kernel, it is much better to make intelligent
use of the subject line, such as the [PATCH], [RFC], and [RFT] (request
for testing) prefixes that keep cropping up.

Everyone should code like that! =)

Unlikely.  Patches are usually rejected because the code is unclear, not
because it is over-documented.  Put slightly differently: if the comment
increases the readability of the code (usually for subtle points), then
it's a good idea, but if the code can't be understood without the
comments, then something's probably wrong with the code.  Please note that
this is my understanding of things, which I'm sure will be corrected if
anyone thinks I'm off base.  (I get the feeling I'm paraphrasing someone
here.)

This is where the 'making noise' stage is quite useful for soliciting
input.  However, for bugs which are known (and small), it's better to fix
them before finalizing the patch.

Frequently, new features that appear in the kernel have only the tools
that the developer has used to test them.  By making sure that people know
about what you've implemented, you increase the chance that someone else
will help build upon them.

I've just gone over the patch, and in my opinion, it is sufficiently small
that making it a config option seems like overkill.  It touches very
little code, and the new feature doesn't affect normal use.  Way cool!
