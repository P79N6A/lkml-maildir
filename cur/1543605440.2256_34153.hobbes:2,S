I think Alexey's netlink socket querying mechanism is the way
to go for this.  Once Alexey sends me an updated version of
these changes, I will put them in and identd can be fixed to
make use of it.  BTW, what does identd need netstat information
for?
And, for a 640MB ram machine, a 4MB hash table is perfectly
reasonable.
Franks a lot,
