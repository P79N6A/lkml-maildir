[return home, was probably unsubscribed from l-k; resubscribing fails:

So, these are quiet times, no bugs from others to worry about.
For myself the worst part about vanilla Linux is that any disk-intensive
action kills the machine. Copy a large file or unpack a large
archive and after some seconds the machine drops dead and remains
dead for many seconds, sometimes several minutes. No reaction to
keystrokes or mouse movement until disk activity has finished.
(Yes, vanilla - no hdparm etc.)
[and then there is spam - I stopped reading the util-linux list
since it had an info:spam ratio of 1:40 - please mail aeb@cwi.nl
directly in case something is wrong]
