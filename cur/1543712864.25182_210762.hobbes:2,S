The RedHat server was apparently broken yesterday. There were many
persons who tried to get the source. Eventually Burton Windle
sent me a copy of the source, that he had previously acquired,
after he tried to access it also.
I compiled the source and the problem persists. Any task that
executes sched_yield() will get "charged" for the time that it
has given away. This is not correct. Maybe it is not correctable,
but it is still not correct. In addition to it being "unfair",
it messes up the totals because tasks that are using the CPU time
given up, also get charged.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
