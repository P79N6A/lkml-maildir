Additionally, ext3_bmap() has this to say about it:
        if (EXT3_I(inode)->i_state & EXT3_STATE_JDATA) {
                /*
                 * This is a REALLY heavyweight approach, but the use of
                 * bmap on dirty files is expected to be extremely rare:
                 * only if we run lilo or swapon on a freshly made file
                 * do we expect this to happen.
                 *
                 * (bmap requires CAP_SYS_RAWIO so this does not
                 * represent an unprivileged user DOS attack --- we'd be
