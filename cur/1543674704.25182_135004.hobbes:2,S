Thanks for the pointer.  In the statically linked case, I get 200/568/345
for custom/pthread_mutex/pthread_spin.
I agree that this is not a fair comparison.  That was my point.  An implementation
with custom yield/sleep
code can do things that you can't do with blocking pthreads primitives at the
same performance.  (Of course pthreads_mutex_lock will win in other cases.)
Please forget about the abort() in the contention case.  I put that there for
brevity since it is not exercised by the test.  The intent was to time the
noncontention performance of a custom lock that first spins, then yields,
and then sleeps, as was stated in the comment.
You are forgetting two issues in your analysis of what pthreads is/should be doing
relative to the spin-lock-like code:
1) The unlock code is different.  If you potentially do a waitforunlocks()
in the locking code, you need to at least check whether the corresponding
notification is necessary when you unlock().  For NPTL that requires another
atomic operation, and hence another dozen to a couple of hundred cycles,
depending on the processor.  You need to look at both the lock and unlock
code.
2) (I hadn't mentioned this before.) The (standard interpretation of)
the memory barrier semantics of the pthreads primitives is too strong.
Arguably they need to be full memory barriers in both directions.
The pthread_spin_lock code inserts an extra full
memory barrier on IA64 as a result, instead of just
using the acquire barrier associated with the cmpxchg.acq instruction. 
(I think the spin unlock code doesn't do this.  One could argue that that's a bug,
though I would argue that the bug is really  in the pthreads spec.)
