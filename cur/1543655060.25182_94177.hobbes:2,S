Well, it definitely doesn't, since at least this test is the wrong way
around (as well as being against the coding style whitespace rules ;-p):
+       if ( ! current_thread_info()->restart_block.fun){
+               return current_thread_info()->restart_block.fun(&parm);
Also, I would suggest against having a NULL pointer, and instead just
initializing it with a function that sets it to an error return (don't use
ENOSYS, since the system call _does_ exist, and ENOSYS is what old kernels
would return if you do it by hand by mistake. I'd suggest -EINTR, since
that will "DoTheRightThing(tm)" if we somehow get confused).
