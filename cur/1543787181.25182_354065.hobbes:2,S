Probably not.  Partly because of the PROCFS issue you noticed after.
And partly because that's a long list, whereas the evidence is that
__vm_stat_account is nowadays being called in the places that need it.
What, you couldn't find the call to __vm_stat_account next to
updating total_vm in do_mmap_pgoff :-?  And I don't see that total_vm
is updated in do_munmap, that and the vm_stat_account have to be done
at a lower, per-vma level.  Haven't looked at the others yet.
I think, better leave hiwater_vm to me for now.  Since I've got that
patchset in the next -mm, it's maybe easier for me to put something
together on top of that.  And it seems quite possible (haven't checked
yet) that actually we should be moving the update of total_vm in to the
core from out all over, rather than splattering hiwater_vm updates about.
I'll take a look in the next couple of days.
