Originally we used a timeout, but when I added the PCI Parity scanning,
that broke while trying to get a PCI spinlock (via a PCI API call)
during the timer interrupt time. I then added the current kernel thread
model and a first attempt. We subsequently received input for the
kthread_* model which is were this patch came from.
Currently the timer event code performs two operations: 
  1) ECC polling and 
  2) PCI parity polling. 
I want to split those from each other, so each can have a seperate cycle
rate (also adding a sysfs cycle control for the PCI parity timing in
addition to the existing ECC cycle control).
One of the thoughts I have had in this refactoring is to utilize worker
queue processing to do the work (and bypass the spinlock issue) which is
triggered by the timer event for PCI parity polling and thus also the
ECC polling for uniformity.
Thoughts are welcome
