The difference between copy_to_user() and memcpy() is not a
minor detail. There is a reason why relayfs does its things the
way it does.

OK, so you are suggesting we start making a difference in the kernel
between those printks which are "optional" and those that are
"compulsory"? Interested kernel developers are free to voice their
interest at any time now ...

I wasn't interested in teaching anyone about buffering basics. The point
I was making is that different buffering schemes have different behaviors
in regards to overflow. IMNSHO I think the drop-the-oldest behavior
is preferable to the drop-whatever-has-gone-away behavior. But maybe
that's just me.

Well, if we're talking about "double loops followed by a nose dive"
we're certainly not going anywhere. I'll leave it to other LKML
subscribers to decided wether automatically resizeable buffers are
of interest.

What I've been trying to say here is that there are no two kinds of
printk. printk is printk and it ought to behave the same in all
instances.
