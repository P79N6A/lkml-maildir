Hi,
I have created a kernel-based http-daemon, implemented as a loadable
module. It started with a discussion on the linux-future list, where two
groups couldn't agree if kernel-based httpd is a good idea. 
I have created such a daemon, so the concept and performance are
(somewhat) known. Even if the result at the end is that kHTTPd is _not_ a
good idea (I think it is, though), it can be used for pinpointing
performance-bottlenecks in the network-code. (kHTTPd can easily saturate a
100 Mbit network with a 350 Mhz K6-2 server).
kHTTPd is GPL'd and can be found at

----- Portion of the README -----
1.	Concept
	kHTTPd is a http-daemon (webserver) for Linux. kHTTPd is different
	from other webservers in that it runs from within the Linux-kernel 
	as a module (device-driver). 
	kHTTPd handles only static (file based) web-pages, but it is able 
	to use a "regular" webserver (Apache and others) to do all the 
	non-static content.
	Static web-pages are, in general, not a very complex thing to do,
	but these are very important nevertheless, since virtually all 
	images are static, and a large portion of the html-pages are
	static also. A "regular" webserver has little added value for 
	static pages, it is simply "copy file to network". The Linux kernel
	is very good at that, for example the nfs (network file system)
	daemon also runs in the kernel.
