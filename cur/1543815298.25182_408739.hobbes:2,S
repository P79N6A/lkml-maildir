Yes, although sid_to_context is meant to be analog to the other
get_peersec calls, and should really be made a proper part of the
interface (can be done later, correctness is the issue at hand).

I don't expect security_sk_sid() to be terribly expensive.  It's not
an AVC check, it's just propagating a label.  But I've not done any
benchmarking on that.
