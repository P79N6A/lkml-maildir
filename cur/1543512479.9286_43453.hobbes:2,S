Actually, it works as a true notifier if equipped with a buffer (which
only needs to be allocated when nonempty, which will not be the
steady-state configuration.)  This would actually be my preferred
choice.

A kernel filesystem, however, requires that the iterators are expanded! 
This is the fundamental problem.  You end up storing potentially
limitless amounts of data in your kernel, especially when you want to
add ACLs to your devices.

Certainly you can - on the filesystem.  Module autoloading works just
fine now.  This is where device name notification in the module files
comes into the picture.

You don't need to store the device tree structure in the kernel.  You
only need to notify with the appropriate iterator, which is a much more
condensed representation.

The reason is that deleting such a device node destroys any metadata
associated with that device node.  This is destruction of information,
and should not be taken lightly.

However, if that means such a device driver is crippled in the common
configuration, then it's a non-option.
