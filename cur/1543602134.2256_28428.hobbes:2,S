No.
Linux supports everything. Try doing a "man stty".
But the default behaviour is ^?, which makes emacs happy, and also happens
to be the default mode for most real vt100 terminals out there.
If you have a terminal that really really wants ^H, just do
	stty erase ^H
and Linux will happily believe you.
