Subject: [RFC] change in /proc/devices
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

	Folks, current /proc/devices is sorted by major number. I'm going
to make the block part ordered by driver registration time. I.e. instead
of
  2 fd
  3 ide0
  8 sd
  9 md
 22 ide1
 65 sd
 66 sd
get
  2 fd
  3 ide
 22 ide
  9 md
  8 sd
 65 sd
 66 sd
(I _really_ don't see the point in separate names for IDE interfaces here,
especially since SCSI disks are uniformly sd on all majors, but that's
another story - I can restore them if needed). Murfy being what he is,
some stuff will assume that the thing is sorted and break on new layout. I
suspect that nothing sane will, though - the thing is sparse anyway, so...
This change is needed if we want to avoid (a) races and (b) major suckage
with exporting spinlocks, etc. If somebody wants to protest - please, do
it _now_.
								Cheers,
									Al
