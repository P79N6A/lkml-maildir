Not entirely correct.  Performance with continous swapping will
be fine as long as the swap bandwidth is lower than available disk
bandwidth. 
This is a narrow line to walk though, memory bandwidth being
much higher than disk bandwith so it don't take much more
swapping before performance drops like a rock.
