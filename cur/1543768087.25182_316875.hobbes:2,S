  Hello,
  thanks for your report. It was quite complete so it was not a big
problem to find the bug ;)

  Hmm, I think the following is happening: with 1KB blocksize we call
journal_begin() with nblocks larger than the biggest possible size of the
transaction (actually your trace in the previous mail was truncated and
I did not see any such process. It would be nice if you could increase
the size of kernel logging buffer - it's in the kernel config - and acquire
the trace again to confirm my suspicion).
  Quota is quite hungry regarding the number of blocks it requires in
a transaction - in setattr we require 558 blocks - and from your boot
messages I can see that your filesystem has maximum transaction size 256
blocks.
  Chris, I don't quite understand these computations in journal_init() -
why do we divide by the 'ratio' when the block size is smaller than
1024? We always count in the number of blocks regardless the block size,
don't we? Also we should add an assertion into journal_start() to BUG()
if we call it with too big nblocks. I guess I should also revise the
quota code and somehow achieve a less pesimistic estimates on the number
of dirtied blocks.
  I'm sorry but I won't be reading emails for the next two days.
Afterwards I'll work on the fix.
