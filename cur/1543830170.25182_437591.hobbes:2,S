preexisting bug, really.  printk() uses smp_processor_id().  Things like
spin_lock() will probably do so in certain debug modes.  We finally got
caught.

I think arch code should do it before calling start_kernel(), really.  It's
just such a basic part of the kernel framework.
A less wholesome but perhaps simpler solution would be to call the new
setup_smp_processor_id() on entry to start_kernel().
