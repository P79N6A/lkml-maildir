If it gets them to read the FAQ, it's done it's job already!
What the flag REALLY means is "I didn't read the FAQ."  In order to know to 
change it, they have to know why it's there...
And it's not to reduce submissions, it's to let Kernel hackers discard them 
more quickly.  (No force on earth can stop clueless requests for tech 
support.  It's like trying to stop spam.  All you can do is filter it more 
effectively.)
