Seems your suspicions were correct, the delay patterns are pretty
similar with all the schedulers, and the big delays aren't caused by the
ioscheduler aparently. I've updated the graphs. In 2.6.5-mm3
at least, all the ioschedulers give alike latencies. I wonder now how did I
get previous measures around 6000ms. I think I blamed a previous
misbehaving kernel version on the ioscheduler. My apologies.
Is there any interest to hack in md code? IIRC the plans are to use dm
in the near future.
Regards.
