I am slightly concerned about using a kmalloc where 'count' is specified
by userspace.  There might be a DoS attack in here somewhere.....
Perhaps we can reverse Andrew's idea: rename the existing bitmap_parse
to bitmap_parse_user, then make the kernel-buffer version, bitmap_parse,
be a wrapper around that.
