 And how to choose goot syscall number ? Are some numbers pre-reserved
to 'private' syscalls ? What numbers are free to use, without fear that
new kernel release will just jump over them !?
 And what about an idea to be able to add syscall by name, from loadab;e
module of course.  Userland application will then resolve 'name' to
number at startup, and use it just as ordinary syscall ?
