Unaligned access warning for user space process will print in a slightly
different format.  It will print process name and its pid, something like:
cgc(15270): unaligned access to 0x20000000002b8025, ip=0x4000000000000b21
(you can also make the differentiation by looking at the data and instruction
 address).
