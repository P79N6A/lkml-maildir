Subject: [PATCH] counting bug in svc_tcp_recvfrom causes panic for TCP NFS
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

When svc_tcp_recvfrom() builds up its iovec to receive a packet, it
invokes page_address() with an argument which refers to
rqstp->rq_argused++.  For some memory layouts (eg not HIMEM and
not WANT_PAGE_VIRTUAL), page_address() is a macro which evalutes its
argument three times.  This results in a kernel panic when an TCP NFS
client sends a packet longer than about 1/3 of the maximum size.
The patch below causes the increment to be performed outside of the
call to page_address(), which avoids the kernel panic.  Perhaps a
better solution would be to change page_address() to be consistently
be a function for all memory layouts.
Thanks,
-Ted
