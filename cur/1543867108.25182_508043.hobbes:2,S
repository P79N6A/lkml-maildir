Subject: [PATCH] Make VMSPLIT options less ambiguous
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/2/12/399

This changes VMSPLIT_2G to really mean 2G, adding VMSPLIT_2G_OPT for the 1920/2176 split. It also prevents either _OPT setting being used when PAE is enabled (
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/12/1/44
 - there doesn't appear to be any patches/commits which allow non-1GB boundary VMSPLIT with PAE yet). The existing !HIGHMEM doesn't make sense, VMSPLIT_3G_OPT may be desireable for a kernel built for multiple systems some of which may only have 1GB. This will require anyone using VMSPLIT_2G to change to VMSPLIT_2G_OPT to get the same effect, but the option was badly named when it was added.
