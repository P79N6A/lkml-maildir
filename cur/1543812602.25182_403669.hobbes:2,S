When ACPI was concieved (~1999 according to the spec I have handy)
ISA-only PCs were somewhat scarce.  It's probably safe to say anything
that supports ACPI has PCI  (For x86[64] at least, I don't know about ia64)
The spec mentions as a minimum requirement for OSPM/ACPI systems
amongst other things..
"A _PRT method for all root PCI bridges"
which pretty much sounds like it's at dependant on PCI (or a later
evolved standard like PCIE) hardware being present.
