I'd already tried this (see my second post to the other thread).  This
only works if you've got APIC enabled.  I don't feel like mucking around
in the library and moving the extern int skip_ioapic_setup out of the
proper ifdef (which is I think what's going on.  That variable gets
ifdef'd out without APIC enabled, I think).
