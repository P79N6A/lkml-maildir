Hi folks,
I haven't found this mentioned anywhere, so hopefully you don't mind
me asking.
When I try to access /dev/dsp ("cat /dev/zero >/dev/dsp") I get some
messages like
Jun 30 22:01:20 bilbo modprobe: FATAL: Module sound_slot_0 not found.
Jun 30 22:01:20 bilbo modprobe: FATAL: Module sound_service_0_3 not found.
in syslog. But which module is supposed to be sound_slot_0 ?
The same alsa configuration works without problems together with
kernel 2.4.21 and alsa 0.99.75. Do I have to ignore the included
alsa driver and use the latest version instead?
Regards
Harri
