Agree, but they are a few hundred cycles wasted.
This can be highly significative when you are working on a Virtual Machine
monitor.
In umview the monitor (umview process) and the process inside the VM
live in separate address spaces.
e.g. To virtualize a write you'd have to call PTRACE_PEEKDATA for each 
word of the buffer, very many hundreds cycles lost.

They are obviously highly dependant on applications.

Umview+unreal test module/NO PTRACE_MULTI/NO PTRACE_SYSVM
$ time cp /unreal/usr/src/linux-source-2.6.16.tar.bz2 /tmp
real    0m22.626s
user    0m0.000s
sys     0m0.448s
Umview+unreal test module/NO_SYSVM  WITH PTRACE_MULTI
$ time cp /unreal/usr/src/linux-source-2.6.16.tar.bz2 /tmp
real    0m1.850s
user    0m0.008s
sys     0m0.384s
Umview+unreal test module/SYSVM+MULTI
$ time cp /unreal/usr/src/linux-source-2.6.16.tar.bz2 /tmp
real    0m1.261s
user    0m0.012s
sys     0m0.392s
This is a test on the cost of umview virtualization with no modules.
Umview alone/NO SYSVM/NO PTRACE_MULTI
$ time cp /usr/src/linux-source-2.6.16.tar.bz2 /tmp
real    0m1.595s
user    0m0.000s
sys     0m0.548s
Umview alone/NO SYSVM (with ptrace_multi)
$ time cp /usr/src/linux-source-2.6.16.tar.bz2 /tmp
real    0m1.587s
user    0m0.008s
sys     0m0.596s
Umview alone/With SYSVM (and ptrace_multi)
$ time cp /usr/src/linux-source-2.6.16.tar.bz2 /tmp
real    0m1.056s
user    0m0.008s
sys     0m0.496s
The same command on the Linux kernel (NO umview)
$ time cp /usr/src/linux-source-2.6.16.tar.bz2 /tmp
real    0m0.429s 
user    0m0.004s
sys     0m0.368s
This is a worst case run of umview as cp is absolutely IO bound (and
system call bound). The more computation a program has the more
efficient is the VM. The user mode VM costs in this case 2.5 times slowdown.
