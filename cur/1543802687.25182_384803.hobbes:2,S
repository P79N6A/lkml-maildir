The fundamental problem is that there is a relatively major latency to wake 
somebody up, and for them to actually run so they can acquire a lock.  In an 
ideal world there would always be a single waiter running trying to acquire the 
lock at the moment it was unlocked and not running until then.
There are better solutions than just madly throwing more waiters in flight on an 
unlock.  Here's three possibilities off the top of my head:
1) It is possible to have a hybrid lock that spins a single waiting thread and 
sleeps waiters 2..n, so there is always a waiter running trying to acquire the 
lock.  It solves the latency problem if the lock is held a length of time at 
least as long as it takes to wake up the next waiter.  But the spinning waiter 
burns some cpu to buy the decreased latency.
2) You could also do the classic spin for awhile and then sleep method.  This 
essentially turns low latency locks into spinlocks but still sleeps locks which 
are held longer and/or are much more contested.
3) There is the option to look at cpu idleness of the current cpu and spin or 
sleep based on that.
4) Accept that we have a cpu efficient high latency lock and use it appropriately.
I'm not saying any of these 4 is what we should do.  I'm just trying to say 
there are options out there that don't involve thundering hurds and luck to 
address the problem.
