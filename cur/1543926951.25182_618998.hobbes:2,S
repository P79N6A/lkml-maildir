In kernel 2.6.23.8 USB_PERSIST feature does not work if the same USB
device is detached and reattached while computer is suspended. The
mount points for the USB storage device mounted before suspend are
lost and the device has to be remounted after resume.
Please advise,
Thank you,
Raymano Garibaldi
