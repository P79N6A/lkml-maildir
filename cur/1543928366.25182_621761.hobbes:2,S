Ok, I think from what I understand of what we're reading here, the apic2 = -1
and pin2 = -1 indicate that the 8259 has no direct connection to any cpu, which
means that on shutdown disable_IO_APIC should take us into virtual wire mode.
As such enabling the APIC early in boot should fix us, but more consisely,
rewriting the entry in the IOAPIC to deliver int0 to the only running cpu should
accomplish the same goal for this problem.  Does that sound reasonable (at least
as a test to ensure we understand the problem) to everyone?
