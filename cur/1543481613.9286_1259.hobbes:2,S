I have an Acer 24x CD-ROM drive.  It's a plain vanilla ATAPI drive
with all the drivers built as modules.  When I mount a CD this is the
message I get:
	hdb: ATAPI 20X CD-ROM drive, 1800kB Cache
When I boot into my Win 95 partition it says it's a 24X drive.
Who's right?
I'm running the -final kernel, and everything else is up to date wrt
the versions given in the Changes doc.  I started seeing this in the
pre7 kernel, which was the first of the pre series I used.
Other than that message the drive seems to work just fine.  I can
mount data CD's and play music CD's without a problem.  I can't,
however, eject the disk.  I've seen that problem discussed here
before.  I don't know if it was supposed to be fixed in the final
version, but I just wanted to report that it's still happening to me.
