OK, not exactly nay, but...  What you are trying to do is a workaround
for problem that can be solved in somewhat saner way.  Namely, we can
make getblk() return buffres backed by pages from device page cache.
It's _not_ an obvious step.  The most sensitive parts are
	* need to allocate all bdev pages with GFP_BUFFER.  Otherwise
we'll eat flaming death on VM deadlocks.  Doable (we can set ->i_data.gfp_mask)
but may lead to interesting effects wrt VM balancing.
	* implementation of bforget()
	* we'll need to kill buffer hash or deal with the new access path
to page-private buffer_heads.
It's solvable, but not obvious.  It _does_ solve coherency problems between
device page cache and buffer cache (thus killing update_buffers() and its
ilk), but the last issue (new access path to page-private buffer_heads)
may be rather nasty.
