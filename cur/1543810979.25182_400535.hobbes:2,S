So without any suggestions, I created a terrible hack that tries to
avoid this issue. Maybe it will spur some discussion. :)
Basically, we set a flag value every time timeofday_periodic_hook() is
run, then every HZ ticks (1 second), we call
timeofday_ensure_correctness() which checks that flag variable to make
sure the periodic_hook has been called in that second. If it has been
called clear the flag and wait another second, otherwise directly call
timeofday_periodic_hook().
This has worked around the starvation in my tests, but I really doubt
its the right solution.
Any other ideas or thoughts?
thanks
