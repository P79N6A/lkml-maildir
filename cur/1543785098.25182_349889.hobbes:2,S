I need to know the kernels value of HZ in a userland app.
getconf CLK_TCK
      and
hz = sysconf (_SC_CLK_TCK)
both seem to return CLOCKS_PER_SEC which is defined as USER_HZ which is 
defined as 100.
include/asm/param.h:
#ifdef __KERNEL__
# define HZ       1000   /* Internal kernel timer frequency */
# define USER_HZ  100    /* .. some user interfaces are in "ticks" */
# define CLOCKS_PER_SEC  (USER_HZ)       /* like times() */
#endif
Thanks in advance for any help
Mark
