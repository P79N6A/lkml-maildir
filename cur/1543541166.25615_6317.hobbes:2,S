As always, it will depend on the exact workload.  For example if you have
a set of processes which do nothing but apply and remove posix locks to
files, I can assure you it's one CPU only.  On the other hand, if you're
doing webserving, I think 
http://www.spec.org/osg/web99/results/res2000q2/
tells its own story about Linux's scalability.  Oooh!
I hadn't noticed before but Dell posted a new one for Q3:
http://www.spec.org/osg/web99/results/res2000q3/web99-20000710-00057.asc
which manages to score almost double the next highest (non-TUX) score.
Management overview of Linux scalability at webserving:
CPU	Score	Scaling
1	1270	100%
2	2200	86.6%
4	4200	82.7%
8	6387	62.9%
Management overview of NT scalability at webserving:
CPU	Score	Scaling
1	732	100%
4	1598	54.6%
so it can be argued that Linux scales to 8 CPUs better than NT scales
to 4 CPUs.  Have a look at the site yourself for all the `this is a
benchmark it is only a benchmark, share prices may go down as well as
up, may contain nuts' disclaimers, but the benchmarks were conducted on
identical hardware, as far as I can see.
