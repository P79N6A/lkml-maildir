Ok. I've seen a similar problem before, so I'll have to check a couple 
of things.
a) ISDN works correctly with a kernel with only numbers (eg 2.2.12)
b) ISDN doesn't work correctly with a kernel with other things in
   the name (eg. 2.2.13-ac1)
c) It's got to do with the routing that ipppd does.
If that's the case, you might want to try the following patch to 
ipppd. The last time I checked ipppd it didn't like extra-versions,
it stopped it from finding the correct linux-version. I could of 
course be wrong, but if I'm not, I'm pretty sure this is the problem
you're having.
Hope this helps,
