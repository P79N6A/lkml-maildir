by changing ALL drivers. And then you realize the common scenario is
that it's taken in irq context ;)

the only alternative to GFP_ATOMIC is GFP_NOIO which is... barely

feel free to first change all the drivers.. once the callers of these
functions have a gfp_t then I'm sure Anil will be happy to take one of
those as well ;-)
