If I had that kind of control over environment my build would always be 
deployed in (including root access), I wouldn't need UML. :)
(P.S. The default for Ubuntu "Horny Hedgehog" is no.  The only tmpfs mount 
is /dev/shm, and /tmp is on / which is ext3.  Yeah, I need to upgrade my 
laptop...)

Yes.  Moot point since Linus doesn't want it.

Might be a performance issue if that gets introduced with per-page 
granularity, and how do you avoid giving back pages we're about to re-use?  
Oh well, bench it when it happens.  (And in any case, it needs a tunable to 
beat the page cache into submission or there's no free memory to give back.  
If there's already such a tuneable, I haven't found it yet.)
