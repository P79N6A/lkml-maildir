I am running stock 2.0.36 (from RedHat 5.2), smbfs 2.0.1 and mounting a
share on a Windows NT 4.0 (SP4) system with smbfs for backup purposes
(tarring from Linux to NT 4.0).  Performance has been bad (approx. 4 hours
to backup 300MB over a no traffic 10Mbit LAN at home), but as of late, it
has become significantly worse.  My backup script has been running for 12
hours now and has backed up ~60MB.  The Linux box itself is running at
proper speed, so I believe this is only related to smbfs.  For what it's
worth, the Linux machine is a K6-233 with 128MB RAM.
Anybody shed any light on what's happened and why the performance has
taken such a hit?
Thanks in advance,
Mike.
