Where did this disable_local_APIC and disable_IO_APIC on x86_64 come
from?  I know we had it on x86 but that was supposed to be a stop gap
until we have the real fix.  Now I know it needs a little more
debugging but the real fix has been written.  Putting it there on
x86_64 makes the code less reliable and it allows things to start
depending on it. 
Please don't saving of the apics to x86_64 propagate this to x86_64.
The rest of the patch looks fine fairly sane, although from a purely
paranoid perspective I can see a few things I would need to look
at more to be certain they are safe.
