This looks like bogus HW, or bogus list of IDE interfaces ...
The IDE layer waits up to 30 seconds for a device to drop it's busy bit,
which is necessary for some drives that aren't fully initialized yet.
I suspect in your case, it's reading "ff", which indicates either that
there is no hardware where the kernel tries to probe, or that there is
bogus IDE interfaces which don't properly have the D7 line pulled low so
that BUSY appears not set in absence of a drive.
I'm not sure how the list of intefaces is probed on this machine, that's
probably where the problem is.
Ben.
