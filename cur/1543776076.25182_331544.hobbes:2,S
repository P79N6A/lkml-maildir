So if I want to share annotations, I have to look in 20 different

I can grant people permissions to write random info into my own files.
Or they can use unionfs if I don't grant them permissions.
Remember: the above argument was citing an advantage of file-as-dir over
packed files (storing metadata as a tar or zip file, similar to what
OpenOffice.org does, or even something like exif or id3).  In a packed
file, I can't allow people to edit the description attribute without
allowing them to edit the entire file.  With file-as-dir, I get much
finer grained permissions.

suid program that allows union mount into a directory within my own tree
(or just into any directory that I have write permissions should be
sufficiently secure).
