No. I guess I should try.

There's only four lock points grand total. 
-- One on the receive side,
-- one to protect the transmit head pointer, 
-- one to protect the transmit tail pointer, 
-- one to protect the location of the transmit low watermark.
The last three share the same lock. I tried using distinct
locks, but this worsened things, probably due to cache-line 
trashing. I tried removing the head pointer lock, but this
failed. I don't know why, and was surprised by this. I thought
hard_start_xmit() was serialized.
