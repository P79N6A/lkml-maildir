That could be PM timer read costing thousands of cycles.
For going into idle it's probably not a real problem, but it could
seriously affect out of idle latencies.
You would really need a cheaper per CPU timer that doesn't
stop in idle (which rules out sched_clock). It's all unfortunately
quite messy.
