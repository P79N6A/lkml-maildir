The patch looks good to me and I certainly agree that probe_irq_on()
should be avoided.  However, as long as this interface is part of the
Linux kernel, we should support it on ia64 since we can't know for
sure when there are no drivers left using that interface.  (And there
is no reason this interface is limited to ISA, though that certainly
is the bus that generally had to use it, for lack of explicit irq
info.)
