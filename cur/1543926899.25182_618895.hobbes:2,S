Nothing really, other than that they use semaphores to avoid lockdep :-/
I think I know how to annotate this, after Alan Stern explained all the
use cases, but I haven't come around to implementing it. Hope to do that
soonish.
Another real semaphore user is XFS, they really use the down/up
asymmetry that semaphores allow, last time I spoke with Dave Chinner he
didn't know a way around this.
