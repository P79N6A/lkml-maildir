Hmm...after this patch, select_bad_process's filter to select process will be
==
	1. ->mm is NULL ?		=> don't select this
	2. is init task ?		=> don't select this
	3. is under specified memcg ?   => don't select this
	4. marked as MEMDIE ?		=> return -1.
	5. PF_EXITING?			=> select this.
	6. OOM_DISABLE ?		=> don't select this
	points = badness(p, uptime.tv_sec);
	7. adjust point & select logic depends on OOM cgroup

Not looks good ;)

I agree here.
Above filter logic should be
==
	current_victim_level++;
	1. p is under oom cgroup of victim_level > current_victim_level => don't select this.
	2. ->mm is NULL ?		=> don't select this
	3. is init task ?		=> don't select this
	4. is under specified memcg ?   => don't select this
	5. marked as MEMDIE ?		=> return -1.
	6. PF_EXITING?			=> select this.
	7. OOM_DISABLE ?		=> don't select this
	points = badness(p, uptime.tv_sec)
==
But this will be too slow.
I think do_each_thread() in select_bad_process() should be replaced with
a routine like this, finally.
==
	for_each_oom_cgroup_in_victim_value_order() {
		for_each_threads_in_oom_cgroup(oom) {
			select one bad thread.
		}
		if (selected_one_is_enough_bad ?)
			return selected_one;
	}
==
And this can be a help for "spped up OOM killer" problem. 
Thanks,
