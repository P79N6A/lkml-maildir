Folks,
  I have just cleaned out about 4000 messages from VGER's queue
which were related to that moronic bandwidth wastage spam from
TICAL.NET's shell account machine (it seems).
Any new bogon coming from that particular machine with exact same
characteristics is blocked, but nothing prevents changeing those
parameters a bit, and another such will be seen...
As a result, nearly all messages with size exceeding about 20 kB
are now in "freezer", and if in the set there is some real thing,
that will hopefully be released once I go over that area.
Oh yes, I "froze" quite a few "stop spamming linux-kernel!" responses
with the entire original message in them.   Lets not be stupid
ourselves folks!
