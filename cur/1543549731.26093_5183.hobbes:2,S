IMHO this is a minor issue because:
1) you need to do page replacement with shared pages
   right
2) you don't /want/ to run low on fs cache, you want
   to have a good balance between thee cache(s) and
   the processes
OTOH, if you have a way to keep fair page aging and
fix the CPU time issue at the same time, I'd love
to see it.

Rik
