I'm missing a clue ... the latest *-mm below
  
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/
I see is:
  2.6.23-rc4/2.6.23-rc4-mm1/
dated two weeks ago, without this fix.
I also don't see any mention of this fix in any recent
lkml or linux-mm mailing list messages.
What am I missing?  Where is this patch?
