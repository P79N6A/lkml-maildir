Subject: [GIT PULL] i2c updates for 2.6.23
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Linus,
Please pull the i2c subsystem updates for Linux 2.6.23 from:
git://jdelvare.pck.nerim.net/jdelvare-2.6 i2c-for-linus
We have two new bus drivers (i2c-pmcmsp for the PMC MSP71xx and
i2c-taos-evm for the TAOS evaluation modules), two new chip drivers
(ds1682 for the Dallas DS1682 elapsed time recorder and tsl2550 for the
TAOS TSL2550 light sensor), speed improvements for i2c-i801 block
transactions and new DocBook documentation. And as usual, cleanups and
fixes all around the place.
Other changes worth mentioning:
* Many embedded I2C bus drivers have been converted to support the
new-style i2c drivers introduced in 2.6.22.
* The i2c_smbus_read_i2c_block_data() function has a new prototype,
finally letting the caller ask for a specific block length.
