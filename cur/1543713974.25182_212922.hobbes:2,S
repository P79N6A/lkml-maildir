Be aware that I've merged a patch from Bill which does all the hugetlb code
unduplication.  A thousand lines gone:

Of course, this buggers up everyone else's patches, but I do think this
work has to come first.
I still need to test this on ppc64 and ia64.  I've dropped a rollup against
2.6.5 at 
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/stuff/mc3.bz2
 which you
should work against until I get -mc3 out for real.
