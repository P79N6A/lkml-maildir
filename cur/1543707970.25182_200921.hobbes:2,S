UTF-8 is the only sane universal encoding in unix.
UTF-16 is not an option; it's not POSIX compatible, it won't work with
the assumptions made by _all_ unix programs that deal with paths, and
in it won't by useful at all in a unix environment without rewriting
*every single program*.
Also, what would be the point?  UTF-16 as an encoding is about as
complex as UTF-8 (charcters in UTF-16 are 2-4 bytes long depending on
the character), so it's equally hard to program with correctly.

Do you have a list or description of the specific stty options that
are used?
