any firewall must keep some sort of state table even if it is udp.  How
else do you manage established connections?  It must know that some high
numbered port is making a udp dns request, and thus be able to allow
that request back thru to the high numbered port client b/c the
connection is already established.
what does any fireawall do if it sees one ip with the same high numbered
udp port make a request in a _very_ short amount of time (under 60ms for
this example)?  It must make a distintion between an attack and legit
traffic.  So if it sees one ip/port make multiple requests in too short
of a time frame, it will drop the traffic, as it probably should.  This
is causing erratic behavior when traffic traverses the firewall b/c the
linux kernel keeps allocating the same source high numbered ephemeral
port.  I would like to know if there is a way to alter this behavior b/c
it is breaking applications.
