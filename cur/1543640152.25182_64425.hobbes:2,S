Would it be possible to better document which Linksys cards are supported 
under the different types of Tulip drivers?
"Some LinkSys PCI cards are of this type"
is not very helpful from a user's point of view....
Also...my Linksys LNE100 TX
seems to work great with dc2114x tulip + new bus config + PCI shared mem 
on 2.5.31.
However, why is its name misdetected?
eth0: ADMtek Comet rev 17 at 0xd5009000, 00:04:5A:85:1F:C4, IRQ 11.
