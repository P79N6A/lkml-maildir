Why does tmscsim not do its job? What is the problem?
What brand and type is your host adaptor? (add lspci if possible)

The AM53C974 driver was removed because it was unmaintained and broken,
it would have been a lot of work to a) fix the driver, b) port it to
2.6. tmscsim only required b).  Even if AM53C974 were put back and
ported to 2.6, it would still be broken.
If it was put back, it still wouldn't work.
I don't know who the official maintainer for tmscsim is now - Kurt
Garloff is still listed, but I wonder if he has time. Describing your
problem in detail on linux-scsi@ might be a good idea.
