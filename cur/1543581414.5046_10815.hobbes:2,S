Subject: 2.4.2-pre2 -- vesafb gives broken virtual terminals.

I just gave 2.4.2-pre2 a spin on my laptop.  This machine
has a Neomagic MagicGraph 128XD (2160) video chip.
My .config included:
	#
	# Console drivers
	#
	CONFIG_VGA_CONSOLE=y
	CONFIG_VIDEO_SELECT=y
	#
	# Frame-buffer support
	#
	CONFIG_FB=y
	CONFIG_DUMMY_CONSOLE=y
	CONFIG_FB_VESA=y
	CONFIG_VIDEO_SELECT=y
Notice that "CONFIG_VIDEO_SELECT=y" is defined twice
(not that this has anything to do with my VTs not
working).
This config fails to give usable VTs.  When I try to
switch virtual terminals, all I get is an underscore
in the top left part of the screen.  Also, XFree86
won't load.  It keeps giving me an error about
being unable to use VT number 2.
The broken config gives this log output:
Feb  9 01:16:36 agate kernel: Console: colour dummy device 80x25

Feb  9 01:16:50 agate kernel: Console: switching to colour frame buffer 
device 128x48
Feb  9 01:16:51 agate kernel: fb0: VESA VGA frame buffer device
If I turn off the framebuffer stuff, I can boot fine and
the virtual terminals work.
Ciao,
