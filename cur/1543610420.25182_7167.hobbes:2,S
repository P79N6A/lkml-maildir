Hello Samium,
Thanks a lot for your response.
Yes, I have -u1 support enabled for both the hard drives (in fact it is 
/sbin/hdparm -m16 -c3 -u1 -X66 -d1 -W1 /dev/hda and /dev/hdc). But, 
unfortunately it does not fix the problem.
Here is the 'hdparm' output from the hard drives:
/dev/hda:
 multcount    = 16 (on)
 I/O support  =  3 (32-bit w/sync)
 unmaskirq    =  1 (on)
 using_dma    =  1 (on)
 keepsettings =  0 (off)
 nowerr       =  0 (off)
 readonly     =  0 (off)
 readahead    =  8 (on)
 geometry     = 1247/255/63, sectors = 20044080, start = 0
/dev/hdc:
 multcount    = 16 (on)
 I/O support  =  3 (32-bit w/sync)
 unmaskirq    =  1 (on)
 using_dma    =  1 (on)
 keepsettings =  0 (off)
 nowerr       =  0 (off)
 readonly     =  0 (off)
 readahead    =  8 (on)
 geometry     = 1240/255/63, sectors = 19931184, start = 0
