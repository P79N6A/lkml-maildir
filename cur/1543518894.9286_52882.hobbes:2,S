Subject: accept() doesn't block as it should in 2.3.x kernels
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The following demo code should block on the call to accept
but it doesn't in 2.3.x, (where x is 24,27,28,30,31, and 32pre2)
2.2.5, 2.2.13, and 2.2.14pre9 block as expected in accept()
I'm getting 
  ENOTCONN    "Transport endpoint is not connected"
The man page for accept(2) leads me to believe that it should block
       If no pending connections are present on the queue,  and  the
       socket  is  not  marked  as  non- blocking,  accept  blocks the
       caller until a connection is present.
I discovered this when attempting to build perl for 2.3.32pre2
 (I'm using libc5.4.44 if that matters)
and it failed in when testing lib/io_unix
I will appreciate your comments
Thanks again,
  David Dyck
