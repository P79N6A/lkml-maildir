Okay, if Rafael likes it... lets take a look.
First... what is the _worst case_ overhead? AFAICT extents are very
good at the best case, but tend to suck for the worst case...?

Your comments are nice, and quite close to linuxdoc... Can we make
them proper linuxdoc?

This is actually important. As it does undocditional free(), it may
not be called "put".

Actually, minimum and 
	  maximum look too similar. start/end are really better names.
