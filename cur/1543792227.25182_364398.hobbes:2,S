Ok, I'll gather more information but I was indeed using udev 0.71 from
Debian with a post 2.6.14 kernel, and it wasn't working for me.  I can
try again with stock udev from kernel.org, if you like, once I verify
that the Debian package hasn't changed anything critical which is
required for correct operation on Debian systems.
