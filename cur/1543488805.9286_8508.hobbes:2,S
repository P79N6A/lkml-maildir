Well, since I jumped to 2.1.x within days of getting Linux in order to get
my soundcard working I don't know if this problem cropped up then but, I
have to say I've never NOT experienced this problem. I can minimise it by
piping the output to another program that slows the ripper down but then
the ppp merely stutters heavily instead of outright freezing up (or slowing
down so much it looks like it's frozen up). When the rip is over with it
resumes normality. (whatever normal is anyway ;)
