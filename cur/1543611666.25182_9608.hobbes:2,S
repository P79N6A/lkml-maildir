Al Viro,
I am seeing subtle data corruption of inode data blocks on ext2 
with 2.4.17-pre1/2.  Large files being untarred over and over 
and over again seem to trigger it, but it's hard to reproduce.  
(i.e. I am building patches against several kernel trees).  
I have gotten it to happen twice.  In both cases, I get a CRC 
error in a tar.gz and a message "skipping to next tar header"
furing this error.  The data is totally corrupted in the tar.gz
when this problem shows up.  It takes **HOURS** of heavy 
untarring/diffing/untarring to make it show up.
Jeff
