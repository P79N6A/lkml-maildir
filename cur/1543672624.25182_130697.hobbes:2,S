I don't think this is quite accurate either.  I have been reading this 
thread, and putting that together with what makes sense to me, I gather 
that Linux uses the following stacks:
1) A variable sized user-space stack, one per process (maybe more for 
user-level threads?).  This is swappable.
2) One 8K kernel stack for each process.  This is used for situations 
such as when a user process makes a system call that then needs to use a 
stack.  This has to be separate from the user stack for two reasons:
    (a) If the user process borked the user stack pointer, the kernel 
still needs to have something valid.
    (b) The stack used by the kernel cannot be swappable.
3) One single interrupt stack for hardware interrupts.  I don't know how 
various CPU's deal with this, so either the CPU knows to use this for 
hardware interrupts, or the hardware interrupt starts using the current 
process's kernel stack then realizes this and switches over.
At the moment, I'm assuming that when the kernel is preempted, the stack 
switched to is one which is the kernel stack for some other process.
