Do you have PCI segmentation disabled in your BIOS? 
iirc what the original submitters claimed is that it didn't boot
without that and this option. Maybe they didn't tell me the whole
story.
The problem is that most people cannot figure out how 
to disable this in the BIOS so we needed a way to make it boot
out of the box.
Booting without PCI-X is better than booting with it.
Maybe we should only do this if PCI segmentation is disabled? 
Folks, I would like to have a full confirmation what actually
doesn't work without pci=noacpi.
Thanks.
