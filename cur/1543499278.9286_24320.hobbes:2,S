It's not just egcs, but a kernel recompile is about the easiest way
to trigger it. AFAIK this problem has been introduced in 2.2.8.
The changes in entry.S seem to contain the trouble, 2.2.9 with
entry.S from 2.2.7 does not show this problem.
Going further: Andrea Arcangeli looked at that code and provided
the following fix; this has worked for me on about 10 machines 
(that are compiling all day).
Another fix seems to be contained in alan's -ac patch series
(same file, look for entry.S) but I still haven't found the time
to really test that (though that version is more desirable since
less expensive)...
