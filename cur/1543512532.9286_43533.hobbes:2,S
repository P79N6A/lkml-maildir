The strangest part is the fact that I was using the floppy drive (formatted
~120 floppies and read about 20, wrote a few more) on another machine
configured almost exactly the same (same mobo, video card.  But the working
box has 2 scsi adaptec cards where the one that didn't has 2 ide drives). 
Even the same nics (down to the fact one is pci and the other is isa and
same models).
I do have the ide-scsi module loaded on the box that dies, but it only dies
in X (didn't test other graphics outside of X)
