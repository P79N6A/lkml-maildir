You are missing:
* allocation code in arch/i386/pci/common.c
* use of the more-generic pci_iommu() wrapper in Calgary code
* ditto in arch/x86_64/kernel/tce.c
* pci_sysdata initialization in arch/x86_64/pci/k8-bus.c
* definition of pci_sysdata in include/asm-i386/pci.h
* bug fix in include/asm-i386/topology.h
* definition of pci_sysdata in include/asm-x86_64/pci.h
* bug fix in include/asm-x86_64/topology.h
You need to take the obviously relevant, non-PCI-domain code from
#pciseg and push it upstream.
