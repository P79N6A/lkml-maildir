Yeah, yeah, I know about the variations of the hardware. That all needs
to be taken into account too when determining worst-case. But I was
focusing on the behavior of Software.  When talking about 100% (or close
to) and hard guarantees, I was talking about knowing the worst case
scenario, so you know that it will work in some time frame, not a point
in time.  Funny, the hardware we used then was also ten years old, and
was much slower than the hardware of the time. Basically, all the
hardware was designed to have little variation, so it also sacrificed
efficiency.  It really felt like working on a 486 today.

I wanted to make a point about the differences that people make when
using the term hard-RT. Unfortunately, I was writing more than thinking,
and really just went on tangent and down a complete wrong path. I guess
that happens when you are doing real work and trying to keep up on this
thread.  My last post on this topic I believe (hopefully) clears up what
I was thinking.
