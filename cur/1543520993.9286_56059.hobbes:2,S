i think this is pretty much 'type-dependent'. In earlier versions of the
zone allocator i added a zone->memory_balanced() function (but removed it
later because it first needed the things your patch adds). Then every zone
can decide for itself wether it's balanced. Eg. the DMA zone is rather
critical and we want to keep it free aggressively (part of that is already
achieved by placing it at the end of the zone chain), the highmem zone
might not need any balancing at all, the normal zone wants some high/low
watermark stuff.
