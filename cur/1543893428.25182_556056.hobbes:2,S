Well there are various ways of doing DMA. Memory returned can be used for 
DMA but it may not be suitable for your DMA device if that device has 
issues like alignment or physical address size restrictions.

Could be. That is why I am looking for a general solution.

We should probably make the minimum slab size dependent on 
ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN. There is no point in having smaller slabs anyways. 
They will all have the same size.
