Not really. The norm under Linux is for non-8250 ports to use
properly-registered device numbers and names. There's not many which are
still broken in this respect -- it's basically pmac_zilog and some Sun
UARTs, isn't it?
And even if it _were_ true, it wouldn't be a particularly good reason
for changing the way we handle serial ports under Linux.

I really don't buy that argument. People cope perfectly well
with /dev/ttySA0 on StrongARM, with /dev/ttySC0 on SH, etc. If it isn't
an 8250, it doesn't usually get called ttyS0. There's certainly nothing
_easier_ about ttyS0. Unless it's really an effort to type that extra
character :)

Because that's the way serial ports are named under Linux. If you want
to change that, then take it up with the serial maintainer -- but
pmac_zilog as it is upstream at the moment is just _broken_. The module
just doesn't load if you have 8250 built in or loaded. That's what you
get when you abuse device numbers belonging to another driver.

Perhaps that's true; I'd certainly never seen a working setup with
pmac_zilog, because I'd never actually seen the module load. It's always
failed for me, because I have 8250 support built in to my kernels.
