ok.

the transparency feature in the shm-largepage patch is quite nice since
you could trivially put an app on the fs w/o any breakage that way (not
everything has to be strictly mapped with bigpages, so it would make the
code more relaxed by just changing the mountpoint). Of course a way
to know for sure if a mapping is marked VM_LARGEPAGE would be needed
then to be sure the app has the right pieces of vm backed with the right
page size.
