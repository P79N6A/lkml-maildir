As the one who started this discussion... I'd simply like to quote this and say:
_FULL_ ack!
[ ... ]
I also changed the whole server (the one which had the aix7xxx problems) in the
meantime... Changed the Adaptec 2940, now there is a Adaptec 29160. I switched
from a Dual-P3 to a P4. And well, the interessting part, I switched from
2.4.20(-XX) to 2.4.19. EVERYTHING runs faster and stable now!
Best regards,
 Oliver
