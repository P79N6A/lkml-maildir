That seems like a lot of added complexity.  Isn't it possible to go 
totally tickless and actually *remove* some of the complexity of the 
current design?  I know Linus has frowned upon the idea in the past, 
but I've had to deal with the tick code a bit in the past, and it seems 
like getting rid of ticks entirely might actually simplify things (both 
conceptually and code-wise).
Seems like we could schedule timer interrupts based solely on add_timer 
type stuff; the scheduler could use it if necessary for load balancing 
(along with fork/exec based balancing perhaps) on large machines where 
load imbalances hurt throughput a lot.  But on small systems if all 
your processes were blocked, you'd just go to sleep indefinitely and 
save a bit of power and avoid unnecessary overhead.
I haven't looked at the lastest tickless patches, so I'm not sure if my 
claims of simplicity are overblown, but especially as multiprocessor 
systems become more and more common it just seems wasteful to wakeup 
all the CPUs every so often only to have them find that they have 
nothing to do.
