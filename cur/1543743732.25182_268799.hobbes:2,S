scan_scsi.c doesn't know what mode the bus is in.  scan_scsi.c doesn't
even know whether the bus is SPI, FC, iSCSI, SAS or SATA.

Yes, we'll do that as long as the device target parameters differ from
the achieved parameters.

Yes, I thought about HVD and decided that I wanted to code the check
against LVD rather than against SE ;-)

I've got some devices that fail PPR when the bus is in SE mode but
work fine when the bus is in LVD mode.  So this patch certainly fixes
those problems.  THe question is whether there exist devices that:
 - Claim to be SCSI3 compliant
 - Fail PPR when on an LVD bus

I think those devices need blacklisting.  Either that, or we need to do
DV in non-approved ways.  Perhaps start with SDTR+WDTR.  If we get up
to Fast-40, then try PPR.  I suspect James has Opinions on this though ;-)
