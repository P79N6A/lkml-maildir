Going to user space you have /proc/mounts and /etc/mtab.

a. play tricks
b. change read_super

Stuff that belongs on the root: historical requirements, mount
points for special filesystems, and locally desired junk.
Instead of "clutter", think "short and fast paths".

There isn't a clash, but this adds a mount order dependency.
It would mean the shm filesystem can not be mounted until
after devfs (or /var in the current code) has successfully
been mounted. Going the other direction, a hung shm filesystem
would prevent /dev or /var from being unmounted.
