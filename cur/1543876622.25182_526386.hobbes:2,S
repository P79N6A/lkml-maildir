This is information you can normally collect form chipset performance
counters. Unfortunately, those are rarely public.
I am focusing on what you can measure using the CPU performance counters.

That is a good question! Thanks for asking.
Assuming you are using a dual core machine, if you would know the bus utilization,
you could determine whether or not it is worth using the 2nd core for your workload.
If one thread already saturates the bus, you can either use the 2nd core for a
non memory-bound workload, or just leave it unused. As you can guess, this information
could be used for thread placement.
Similarly, if you see a low bus utilization for a memory-bound program, then this
could be a sign that the program is not well optimized, e.g., not issuing software
prefetch. Here this is about code tuning.
There a lot of information to be gleaned for using the performance counters especially
for multi-core platforms.
