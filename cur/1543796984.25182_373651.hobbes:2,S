As I said, the potential for problems is very high.  I did not say it 
was unacceptable.  The barrier for entry is higher, though, yes.
The current case in point is several reverse-engineered wireless 
drivers.  I am not inclined to merge a few of the questionable projects, 
but the Broadcom wireless project seems to have been done right, so it 
will likely get merged quickly (once it passes quality/code reviews, etc.)
