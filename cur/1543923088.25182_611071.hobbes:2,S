Hi, Jeff, Sam!
I just pulled from Linus-tree, and got the following error when building uml.
$ make defconfig ARCH=um
/home/wangcong/projects/linux-2.6/arch/um/Makefile-i386:32: /home/wangcong/projects/linux-2.6/arch/i386/Makefile.cpu: No such file or directory
make: *** No rule to make target `/home/wangcong/projects/linux-2.6/arch/i386/Makefile.cpu'.  Stop.
Is this a known problem? Yesterday's Linus-tree was fine.
Regards.
