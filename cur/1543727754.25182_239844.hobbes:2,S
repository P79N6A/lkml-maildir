Hmm. 
You really shouldn't use %ebx for flags. Use %edx instead. 
%ebx is call-save, so by forcing gcc to use %edx, you're guaranteeing that 
the compiler has to save/restore the register even for a simple function 
that wouldn't otherwise need it.
Also, why export the "failed" ones:

that looks just broken.
