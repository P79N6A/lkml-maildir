Probably because people think that's hard ... so they invent another thing  
that's even harder.

That's part of the problem. The other is the idea that mmap only needs to  
read those pages actually needed.
Hmm.
Would it be possible - and cheap enough - to do this optimization:
When read()ing a file, *if* nobody else has that inode open (which is  
probably impossible to determine with networked filesystems, so one would  
probably have to exclude those), create mmap-like mappings where possible  
without actually reading the pages; at the moment someone else opens the  
file, actually read them in and mark them PAGE_COPY.
Or maybe just do it exclusive of writers, not readers.
(I don't think waiting for actual writes would be sensible.)
