We've already got a patch for this in Greg's PCI tree, hopefully it 
should go in for 2.6.24.
Are you getting MMCONFIG enabled on your system with 2.6.23? If not this 
problem shouldn't matter. In the cases I've seen that have caused 
problems in the past (Intel boards mainly), where the MMCONFIG area 
overlaps with where the graphics card BAR ends up during BAR sizing, the 
BIOS happened to not reserve the MMCONFIG table in the E820 memory map, 
so current mainline will turn off MMCONFIG. However, it's quite possible 
that some systems will pass the old E820 validation check and turn on 
MMCONFIG where the overlap happens..
There's a patch in Andi's tree (also hopefully for 2.6.24) to loosen the 
MMCONFIG validation to check against ACPI reservations instead of the 
E820 map (which isn't required to have a reservation for MMCONFIG). This 
makes the disable-decode change more critical.
