I actually named that function to_pci_state(), but you had same idea.

Hmm, I do not think it is that easy
suspend is:
	stop hardware
hotunplug is:
	stop hardware
	tell user/system it is gone
So it is more like suspend is subset of hotunplug. If coded properly,
hotunplug should probably call suspend code, resulting in no
duplication.
