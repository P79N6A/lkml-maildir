Are we really sure about this?  A quick peek at ptrace_check_attach() and
ptrace_untrace() (for example) indicates that we are using ->siglock to
synchronise access to the task state.
It's hard to see how swapping the assignment and the unlock in there could
break anything, but it does need to be gone through with a toothcomb
looking for synchronization issues as well as for missing memory barriers
(ptrace_check_attach doesn't use them, for example).
Nothing specific.  Just .... worried.
