Nobody would die if we didn't, but there's nothing wrong with the idea
in general. At least you'd know that the parameter was actually parsed.
I wish usb-handoff was exported similarly, because there's absolutely
no way to tell if it worked or was quietly ignored. And I abhor printks
in normal or success cases, so I do not want such indication.
