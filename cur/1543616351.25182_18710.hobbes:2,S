Hmmm, I don't know about that, as long as the (source) code is different,
I don't think it can be argued that it was copied not created.  But that's
probably a legal battle that no-one would want to get in to.

But the first of your two chosen sentences seems to read as
copy/duplicating in the sense of piracy.  Obviously as it isn't 100%
clear, then it would be a possible legal case for Microsoft, but to be
honest I can't see the courts going with it.  Otherwise there would only
be one product of each particular type of software.
As to the second: under UK law any license which tries to restrict the
lawful users ability to decompile the product is expressly void.  They
cannot enforce that portion of the contract under UK law (which a UK
citizen buying Windows in the UK would come under).

I certainly would be interested in hearing his comments...is he here and
watching this thread? :-)

OK, I understand not publishing the decompiled code, but what would be the
problem is publishing your code.

Maybe true, but surely though if the decompiling was done outside of the
US and the decompiled code not taken to the US, then the new code is
purely code that works with M$ products.

I wonder AC's refusal was more of a statement on the ludicrousness of the
law rather than actually required.

Where does it say this?

Hmm, an interesting point...although they'd be hard pressed to do that
when it's decompiled under Linux (extracted from the CAB files off the CD
and decompiled using a Linux tool).

And thanks so far...
Must remember not to use my work (i-a) address in posts though...
