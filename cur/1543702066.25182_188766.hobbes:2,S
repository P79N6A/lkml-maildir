  [PATCH] ia32 jiffy wrapping fixes
Causes the voyager boot to hang.  The problem is this change:

+               return (unsigned long long)get_jiffies_64() *
(1000000000 / HZ);
Apart from the fact (that I've whined about before) that this
sched_clock() function should be one of the timer function pointers, so
there isn't this CONFIG_NUMA dependence (unless I can also add a
CONFIG_X86_VOYAGER dependence to it as well), the problem seems to be
some type of bad resonance between the jiffies_64 update and the
xtime_lock in get_jiffies_64().  I think this may indicate that HZ needs
to be reduced to 100 on voyager;  however, there is also no need to get
the xtime sequence lock every time we do a jiffies_64 read, since the
only unstable time is when we may be updating both halves of it
non-atomically.  Thus, we only need the sequence lock when the bottom
half is zero.  This should improve the fast path of get_jiffies_64() for
all x86 arch's.
