ASUS K8N-E-Deluxe, nForce3 250Gb chipset, AMD Athlon64 3200+ running x86_64
Sil 3114A with 3 Maxtor MaxLine III+ 250GBSATA disks running in linux raid1,
linux raid0 and linux LVM2
Boots and runs without problem with 2.6.15-rc5-git1,
Applying this patch lets it boot, but I cant login either locally or with
ssh, no output on VT12 or in the logs, but the hd led is lit all the
time...
only way to reboot is the reset button...
Distribution is Mandriva Linux 2006 x86_64, gcc 4.0.1
attached are config and /var/log/messages parts that got logged
