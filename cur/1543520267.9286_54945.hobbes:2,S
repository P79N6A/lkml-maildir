aic7xxx cards are crap. Doug Ledford doing herculean work to make them usable
somehow but they are still do not work well (they constantly hung under really
heavy load). That's all. It's not problem with linux's SCSI driver or anything.
It's bad hardware design. There are only one solution to problem: throw out
your card in window and buy Buslogic.

P.S. If you want to say "but there are so many vendors who are using aic7xxx
in servers" then I want to remind you that there are so many verdors who are
installing WindowsNT on servers as well. Now what ?
