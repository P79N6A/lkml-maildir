Thanks for the advice. You're right, this is not the way forward. I must
admit that I did indeed an huge mistake with this patch.
I've initially developed it a couple of years ago for use in udpcast.
Once done, regular attention was needed for it to adapt it to new
kernels. At one point in time (this September), I figured that I could
save that maintenance effort by getting it integrated into the mainline
kernel. At the same time, I figured, other developers of embedded
systems could profit from it. A win-win situation. Or so I thought.
However, now that I look back on the 3 past months, I figure that the
amount of effort that I poured into this was disproportionate compared
to what I used to spend on maintaining it out of kernel. Even if I
continued evolving it until the end of my life, I would spend _less_
time on it than I did in the last 3 months.
My conclusion is that I'll continue like I did before last summer: to
maintain it on my own website (
http://udpcast.linux.lu/source.html
)
along with udpcast.
Anybody is still welcome to use it as he sees fit. If a brave soul with
more patience than me wants to plead with the powers-that-be to get it
into official kernel, he has my support. But for myself, I give up on
this quest, it is simply too much hassle to be worthwhile...
