I think you misunderstand (and I apologize for causing the confusion).
It is _required_ that the patches include the full path in the header. 
You did this correctly:
--- linux-2.6.7-rc1/drivers/net/wireless/prism54/islpci_eth.c	18 Mar 
2004 15:27:44 -0000	1.31
+++ linux-2.6.7-rc1/drivers/net/wireless/prism54/islpci_eth.c	19 Mar 2004
I am referring to the CVS substitution variables embedded in your source 
code.  In this case $Header$.
However, consider what happens when I do:
1) apply patch #1
2) reject patch #2
3) attempt to apply patch #3
If each patch updates the $Header$, then patch #3 cannot be applied 
because patch(1) will reject it due to the now-incorrect $Header$ line.
The $Header$ _forces_ me to apply your patches in order, all or none.  I 
don't think you want that ;-)
