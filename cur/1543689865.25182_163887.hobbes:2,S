Tried an older kernel (2.5.6x-series) and the event input kernel log flood
is happening there, too.
Can't really test for SMP, etc. as -test3 was the first kernel I tried since
2.5.4x that booted properly on this system, and didn't panic quickly on
various stuff.  I can try a binary search across kernel versions, if I knew
what to test for.
Anyone have an idea?
