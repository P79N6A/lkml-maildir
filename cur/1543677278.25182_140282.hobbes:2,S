Eh? Why must you completely re-engineer a solution because you see the 
current one as deficient? Not only is it completely over-engineered by 
enforcing your fanatical ideas about requiring a new system daemon, but 
it's total pre-mature optimization. 
On top of that, you don't have any accurate numbers to back up your 
claims. Please perform and post the timings I suggested yesterday, and 
then we'll talk.

Then it is your responsibility to merge the continuing efforts and design 
goals of the kernel with the requirements of your high-paying customers in 
the smoothest possible way. Serving one while ignoring the other is a good 
way to waste a lot of time and money. 
I care about availability. But, I am not willing to integrate or support 
features that come from some random person just because they claim to 
improve availability, especially when a) I don't like the numbers and b) 
there are no numbers to back it up.

And this improves availability how?
