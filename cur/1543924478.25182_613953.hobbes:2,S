That's only partial list.  All the kernel threads - which are most important
in this context - aren't shown.  You ran out of dmesg buffer, and the most
interesting entries was at the beginning.  If your /var/log partition is
working, the stuff should be in /var/log/kern.log or equivalent.  If it's
not working, there is a way to capture the info still, by stopping syslogd,
cat'ing /proc/kmsg to some tmpfs file and scp'ing it elsewhere.
