Oops, you have an older version.
How did that happen... oh, because I sent it to you.  Fuck.
But either way, it shouldn't be triggering.  Andrew, please revert it,
and I'll work with Vladis to figure out what's happening.
Vladis, relative patch, actually sets error code.  What happens now?
Please send module which fails if it still fails...
Rusty.
