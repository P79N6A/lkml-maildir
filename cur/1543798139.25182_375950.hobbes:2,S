Nope, because struct array_cache includes a variable length table of pointers 
to hold a cache of available objects per cpu. The 'limit' (the number of 
pointer in this cache) depends on the object size.
See enable_cpucache in mm/slab.c for 'limit' determination :
         if (cachep->objsize > 131072)
                 limit = 1;
         else if (cachep->objsize > PAGE_SIZE)
                 limit = 8;
         else if (cachep->objsize > 1024)
                 limit = 24;
         else if (cachep->objsize > 256)
                 limit = 54;
         else
                 limit = 120;
Let's take an example :
grep dentry /proc/slabinfo
dentry_cache      157113 425289    224   17    1 : tunables  120   60    8 : 
slabdata  25017  25017      0
'limit' is the number following 'tunable' : 120
On a 64 bits machines, 120*sizeof(void*) = 120*8 = 960
So for small objects (<= 256 bytes), you end with a sizeof(arracy_cache) = 
1024 bytes per cpu
If 512 CPUS : 512*1024 = 512 Kbytes + all other kmem_cache structures : (If 
you have a lot of Memory Nodes, then it can be very big too)
If you know that no more than 100 objects are used in 99% of setups, then a 
dedicated cache is overkill.

You are welcome.
