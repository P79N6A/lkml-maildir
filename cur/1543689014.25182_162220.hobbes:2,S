Previous kernel was linux-2.4.20. Linux-2.4.21 would never complete
a boot on my system so I gave up on that one.

Also, I replaced linux-2.4.22/kernel/prink.c with the one from
linux-2.4.21 and it did not help the missing boot data problem.
I also changed the buffer size to 131,072 and it didn't help
either so the problem is not in printk.c, but somewhere else,
perhaps klogd.
