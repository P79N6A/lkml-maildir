I'm pretty sure there's precedent for using __get_user in this way 
(get_user is a different matter, since it cares about whether the 
address is within the user part of the address space).  Certainly in 
arch/i386 code there shouldn't be a problem.  Is there some other way to 
achieve the same effect (without manually setting up an exception/fixup 
block)?
