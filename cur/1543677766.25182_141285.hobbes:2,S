Look in subsys_attr_show().  It is being passed a kobject, which is a
member of a "struct sys_device".  We can tell this because I printed out
the address of the sys device in sys_device_register().  A to_subsys()
is being performed on that object, which is wrong, because the kobject
is not a member of a "struct subsystem".

They're not out of sync, it's getting garbage because of the bogus
to_subsys().

I'll cc him to make him feel bad :)
