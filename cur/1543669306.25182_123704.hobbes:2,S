[ I swear I was just talking about this problem with someone else... ]
1. /proc/profile is a binary file.  cat won't show you anything
meaningful.
2. the 0 output by readprofile is a problem with the automatic
byte-order detection heuristic built into the code.  Try invoking
readprofile with the "-n" option, and see if your problem goes away.
FYI: For those that might also run into this, the essence of the problem
is this piece of code in readprofile.c (fragmented for clarity):
"optNative" is 0.
"buf" is an unsigned int *.
if (!optNative) {
        int entries = len/sizeof(*buf);
        int big = 0,small = 0,i;
        unsigned *p;
        for (p = buf+1; p < buf+entries; p++)
                if (*p) {
                        if (*p >= 1 << (sizeof(*buf)/2)) big++;
                        else small++;
                }       
        if (big > small) {
                fprintf(stderr,"Assuming reversed byte order. "
                   "Use -n to force native byte order.\n");
                <snipped>
                .
                .
                .
        }       
}
Based on my read of the code, "big" will be incremented if *p >= 4,
otherwise "small" will be incremented.  I can't see how this would ever
detect the byte order...
Werner proposed this as a solution, but it could still fail to correctly
detect the byteorder (although with much less frequency):
