Cool.  With a setup that clean I think I can break the multiple firmware
code out easily as well.
        firmware-y			:= firmware-pcbios
        firmware-$(CONFIG_LINUXBIOS)	:= firmware-linuxbios
        ...
        FIRMWARE			:= $(firmware-y)
I had it broken out cleanly earlier, but everyone was concentrating
on other things and I just haven't been able to get back to that
stuff until this week.  It will be a little tight coming in under
the wire with working code but we will see.
Unless someone has some objections...
