I admit that although *my* configuration works now, somebody else who understands
the code better (Yu Luming and Len Brown, probably) get to decide if it's an "obvious"
fix or something that introduces other issues.  I know back around 2.5.68, there was a
2-line change to the Cardbus support that broke my Xircom card, but backing it out
was technically wrong as well - the proper fix involved a complete re-write of the Yenta
stuff.
