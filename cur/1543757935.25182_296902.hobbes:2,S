As far as I can tell, noone fretted about the addition of Threads:,
ShdPnd:, etc., which were not always there.

Is the request to see the limit settings, or the current usage, or both?
What kind of format are you suggesting?  I don't see a need for something
with a million little files.  Also, for some of the limits the correct
current usage count is not trivial to ascertain.  (And for others like
RLIMIT_FSIZE and RLIMIT_CORE, it is of course not meaningful at all.)
Thanks,
Roland
