We noticed that ;)
void __init setup_local_APIC (void)
{
        unsigned long value, ver, maxlvt;
        /* Pound the ESR really hard over the head with a big hammer - mbligh */
        if (esr_disable) {
                apic_write(APIC_ESR, 0);
                apic_write(APIC_ESR, 0);
                apic_write(APIC_ESR, 0);
                apic_write(APIC_ESR, 0);
        }
