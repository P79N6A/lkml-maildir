Have a look at:
http://csl.cse.ucsc.edu/smart.shtml
there you will find software for interrogating and monitoring the S.M.A.R.T. data available from your drive.  It's a little late to start monitoring it, if the drive is already dying, but if, for example, it shows a lot of re-allocated sectors, or spin retries, you'll know something is wrong.
