As expected, this behaved OK on an x86 laptop.  I'll see if it breaks
some of the ARM boards I have handy.
To be clear, what this means is that if "clockevent" and "clocksource"
devices get registered "very early", and the various clockevent and
clock source devices get registered, then the suspend/resume methods
for those will all get grouped together ... suspended "very late" and
resumed "very early", regardless of when they get registered.  Pretty
much the driver model parts of what Linus was suggesting; clockevent
bits would still be needed.
