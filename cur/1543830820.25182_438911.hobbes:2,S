I have my unpack/build directory set to a group ownership which prevents 
"just anyone" from writing, and have the "setgid" bit on (mode 2775) 
which interestingly propagates. So everything has the same group, and 
you can set your umask to do what you want. I want everything world 
readable, writable by group. YMMV.

   Obscure bug of 2004: BASH BUFFER OVERFLOW - if bash is being run by a
normal user and is setuid root, with the "vi" line edit mode selected,
and the character set is "big5," an off-by-one errors occurs during
wildcard (glob) expansion.
