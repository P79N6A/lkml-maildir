(Subject: [NET] fixed /proc/net/raw{,6} seq_file support)
raw_iter_state is just an integer. Without that patch, the integer is 
stored directly in the seq->private pointer (note the & in the define of 
raw_seq_private, around line 690 of net/ipv4/raw.c). The patch converts 
part of the code to an pointer to an integer, but other parts still 
consider seq->private as an integer. The oops is actually a BUG 
statement in kmalloc: it complains (if CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB is enabled) 
about the invalid pointer.
