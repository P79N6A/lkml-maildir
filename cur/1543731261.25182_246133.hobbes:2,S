I had similar problems with almost the same setup because of devfs, and 
specially because of devfsd (the devfs deamon).
I suggest you try first to disable the devfsd, and then disbale devfs 
completely. I think there are very ugly race conditions there that only 
appear on a "fast enough" CF card.
If you're not using devfs, then I don't know what the problem is... :(
