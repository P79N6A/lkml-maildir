I assume by RealTek you mean 8139.  Please provide "lspci" or "dmesg" or
-something- other than "my realtek builtin NIC."
Can you try the latest 8139too.c from gkernel CVS? 
(
http://sf.net/projects/gkernel/
 checkout module "linux_2_4")
Does enabling CONFIG_8139TOO_PIO change things?
Can you get any output when enabling RTL8139_DEBUG?
