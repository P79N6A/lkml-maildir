That error is a DID_NO_CONNECT.  For the symbios driver that means a selection 
timeout, I think.

They go in 8 bits from LSB to MSB: status byte, message byte, host byte, 
driver byte.  The first two (status and message) are the SCSI return codes 
from the device.  The latter two are set by the driver (that's where the 
DID_NO_CONNECT is).  See drivers/scsi/scsi.h
