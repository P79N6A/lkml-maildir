Wrong. It is very well possible to determine the path of a particular dentry 
(+ vfsmount) with bind mounts.

This doesn't make sense, either. With the following sequence of syscalls of 
processes A and B (both of them in the namespace root),
	A:				B:
	mkdir("/tmp/a")
	chdir("/tmp/a")
					rename("/tmp/a", "/tmp/b")
	creat("f")
the path being checked for the creat call must be "/tmp/b/f", even though 
process A never explicitly used "b". If that's not what TOMOYO is doing, then 
that's badly broken.
