That's exactly the sort of use I had in mind :) I'm actually the
one who added the ability to use WARN_ON inside an if clause.
Just as the case of a BUG_ON, a WARN_ON should never occur in
practice, unless there is a bug which the code is not aware of.
As such we want it to go away completely if CONFIG_BUG is off.

If you're using it for a scenario which is known to actually
occur, then some other mechanism should be chosen in place of
WARN_ON.
