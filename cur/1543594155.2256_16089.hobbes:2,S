You can try isdn4linux@listserv.isdn4linux.de or the newsgroup 
de.alt.comm.isdn4linux.de, but I can't guarantee success there, either.

The problem is obviously that you're lacking the avma1_cs.o module. I 
believe it was distributed separately and not included in the kernel tree 
/ pcmcia-cs. If you want to go look for it, try linux-pcmcia on 
sourceforge.net, or your favorite web search engine.
If you dig it up somewhere and get it working with 2.4.5, it would be nice 
if you let me know. We can then work together to integrate it into the 
kernel tree - I can't do it myself, because I don't have the card.
