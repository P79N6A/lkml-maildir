Subject: Linux SATA Support Question - Is the ULI M1575 chip supported?

In the source:
enum {
         uli_5289                = 0,
         uli_5287                = 1,
         uli_5281                = 2,
         uli_max_ports           = 4,
         /* PCI configuration registers */
         ULI5287_BASE            = 0x90, /* sata0 phy SCR registers */
         ULI5287_OFFS            = 0x10, /* offset from sata0->sata1 phy 
regs */
         ULI5281_BASE            = 0x60, /* sata0 phy SCR  registers */
         ULI5281_OFFS            = 0x60, /* offset from sata0->sata1 phy 
regs */
};
However, in the manual for this motherboard it states it has a ULI M1575, 
can anyone comment?
