Hello, list,
Recently, i have messed up with the follow problem, i have two server
both with two ethernet cards. Here are them:
[root@db1 ~]# lspci | grep -i eth
05:00.0 Ethernet controller: Marvell Technology Group Ltd. Gigabit
Ethernet Controller (rev 18)
07:04.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corp. 82541GI/PI Gigabit Ethernet
Controller (rev 05)
And they are running MySQL server on both of them. The OS is RHEL 4 with
the default kernel 2.6.9-5.ELsmp. These days there are lots of error
message comming out in /var/log/message and dmesg.
KERNEL: assertion (tp->copied_seq == tp->rcv_nxt || (flags & (MSG_PEEK |
MSG_TRUNC))) failed at net/ipv4/tcp.c (1348)
KERNEL: assertion (tp->copied_seq == tp->rcv_nxt || (flags & (MSG_PEEK |
MSG_TRUNC))) failed at net/ipv4/tcp.c (1348)
KERNEL: assertion (tp->copied_seq == tp->rcv_nxt || (flags & (MSG_PEEK |
MSG_TRUNC))) failed at net/ipv4/tcp.c (1348)

KERNEL: assertion (flags & MSG_PEEK) failed at net/ipv4/tcp.c (1284)
When it appeared, the network of Marvell card has been broken. It
connected but accessable.
We have installed the driver of the Marvell card manully with the driver
"Driver version: 8.30.2.3 (Dec-14-2005)".
I have digged in google for a long time. But unluckly, i haven't got the
sulotion.
Did i need a kernel upgrade or driver upgrade or anything else?
Every response is apperciated.
Wang.
