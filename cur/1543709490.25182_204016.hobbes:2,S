Hello Andrew,
From 
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0111.1/1401.html
 and
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0111.1/1636.html
 , I see that
this topic has been visited at least once before, but this behavior appears
still to be present in Linux 2.6.3.
The O_ASYNC flag has no affect (in terms of signal generation) when
specified in a call to open().  For example, if we make the following set of
calls:
    fd = open("/dev/tty2", O_RDONLY | O_ASYNC);
    fcntl(fd, F_SETOWN, getpid());
Then the call:
    flags = fcntl(fd, F_GETFL);
tells us that O_ASYNC is in 'flags', but no signal is delivered when input
becomes available on the terminal.  (We see the same behaviour if opening a
FIFO on 2.6.3.).  On the other hand, the following does result in the
generation of SIGIO signals when input is available:
    fd = open("/dev/tty2", O_RDONLY);
    flags = fcntl(fd, F_GETFL);
    fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, flags | O_ASYNC);
    fcntl(fd, F_SETOWN, getpid());
Furthermore, the following sequence also results in generation of SIGIO when
input is available, but only after the final fcntl() call:
    fd = open("/dev/tty2", O_RDONLY) | O_ASYNC;
    fcntl(fd, F_SETOWN, getpid());
    fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, 0);
    fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, O_ASYNC);
I assume the patch referred to at the second URL above fixes this problem,
but I haven't tested it.  The question is, why is this still broken?
Cheers,
Michael
