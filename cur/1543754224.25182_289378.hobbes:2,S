The lock is needed for the console at least and for some driver level
bits.

True - that would need an ldisc.close and the vhangup no longer does
that.

Not really. I'm in n_tty ->chars_in_buffer and the race occurs -> I'm
dead
as I'm already running the wrong chars_in_buffer function on CPU #0 when
CPU #1
comes along and flips ldisc. Holding the right locks matters here. We
also
need both locks holding really for tty/pty pairs because pty_write wants
to
output to the ldisc of the other side. Treating no ldisc as no
characters
seems very sane however and is easy to code up - if the ldisc_get fails
we
can sleep on the ldisc level wait queue then retry. Ugly enough to want
to
hide the contents in tty_io.c but doable. (When I get time - likely to
be 
a couple of weeks if nobody does it first)
