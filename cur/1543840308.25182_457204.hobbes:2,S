I  looked at that in more details. I can get by with 2 extra TIF flags. The problem
is that I have still hooked up to the TIF_NOTIFY_RESUME mechanism to get to  the
do_notify_resume() function. To make this work I have to either set TIF_NOTIFY_RESUME
*and* TIF_PERFMON_XXX or I have to add TIF_PERFMON_XXX to this kind of code in
entry.S:
	sysret_signal:
        	sti
        	testl $(_TIF_SIGPENDING|_TIF_NOTIFY_RESUME|_TIF_SINGLESTEP),%edx
        	jz    1f
        	/* Really a signal */
        	/* edx: work flags (arg3) */
        	leaq do_notify_resume(%rip),%rax
        	leaq -ARGOFFSET(%rsp),%rdi # &pt_regs -> arg1
        	xorl %esi,%esi # oldset -> arg2
But there seems to be some limitations on the low order 16 bits for the _TIF_ALLWORK_MASK
which is also being checked in entry.S and my TIF_PERFMON are 20 and above.
