Hi all,
A lot of people have asked me if there is anything they can do to help
out kernel.org.  At this point, the number one thing anyone could do to
help, and which would be reasonably self-contained a project, would be
to help maintain our fork of gitweb:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=git/warthog9/gitweb.git;a=summary
We really need the caching version of gitweb, but it does have a number
of problems, including the non-working tarball generator.
