   This bug was introduced in 2.5.43-bk1, previous versions are ok.
   I think it might be 
   ChangeSet 1.781.1.68 2002/10/15 19:01:33 kuznet@mops.inr.ac.ru
   but i'm not sure.
It's not possible, if this functions modified here did not work you
would not be able to make any connections at all.
Can you try reverting the networking changesets one by one until
the problem goes away?
