Hm.  BIO_RW_AHEAD seems unused:
willy@honeydew:~/kernel/linux-2.6$ grep -r BIO_RW_AHEAD *
block/blktrace.c:       (((rw) & (1 << BIO_RW_AHEAD)) << (2 - BIO_RW_AHEAD))
include/linux/bio.h:#define BIO_RW_AHEAD        1
include/linux/bio.h:#define bio_rw_ahead(bio)   ((bio)->bi_rw & (1 << BIO_RW_AHEAD))
willy@honeydew:~/kernel/linux-2.6$ grep -r bio_rw_ahead *
block/ll_rw_blk.c:      if (bio_rw_ahead(bio) || bio_failfast(bio))
drivers/md/dm-mpath.c:  if ((error == -EWOULDBLOCK) && bio_rw_ahead(bio))
drivers/md/multipath.c: else if (!bio_rw_ahead(bio)) {
include/linux/bio.h:#define bio_rw_ahead(bio)   ((bio)->bi_rw & (1 << BIO_RW_AHEAD))
BIO_RW_BARRIER seems to be __REQ_HARDBARRIER, but we set it
explicitly in init_request_from_bio().  We could probably simplify
init_request_from_bio() with the patch in the previous message.
