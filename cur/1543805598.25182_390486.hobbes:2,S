Regardless of why, that is just the simplest scenario I could think
of that would give us a test case. However...
Why not hold onto it? We sometimes do this in the kernel if we need
to take a lock that is incompatible with the lock already being held,
or if we discover we need to take a mutex which nests outside our
currently held lock in other paths. Ie to prevent deadlock.
Another reason might be because we will be running for a very long
time without requiring the lock. Or we might like to release it because
we expect a higher priority process to take it.
