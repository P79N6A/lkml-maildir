I just stepped over the line again with a message too long
for the lklm.  Am I the only one who would like a message
back when lklm drops a message?  The mail system seems to
say:
relay=vger.kernel.org. [209.116.70.75], 
stat=Sent (2.7.0 nothing apparently wrong in the message.;
S264820AbSJaKoJ)
and then drop the message.  Maybe, at least this response
could be changed.
