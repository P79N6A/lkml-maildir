Writable+executable isn't the problem. Scan executable for pointers to
string "/bin/sh". Locate entry point of exec in libc. Smash the stack so
that function calls exec with "/bin/sh" as an argument. Solar Designer's
patch makes this a little trickier by making libraries have zero bytes in
their addresses, but a little knowledge of the dynamic linker got around
this. Read the exploit you linked carefully - it's exploiting things that
can't be bandaided over.
As for the number of exploits this would stop, including this in the
mainstream kernel would only be a stopgap measure. All it took to open the
floodgates for stack smashing exploits was a single well-written article -
Aleph One's "Smashing the Stack for Fun and Profit". Now writing an
exploit once you find an overflow is a cookbook exercise. A 2nd edition of
the cookbook would be all it would take to render the patch meaningless.
The problem isn't Intel's fault or any OS's, it's a problem in the C
language and compiler. There are 5 fixes:
a) write safe code (which has so far proved hard)
b) compile with bounds-checking (big performance hit)
c) compile with StackGuard, etc. (doesn't stop exploits that corrupt
   other locals)
d) separate the return address stack from the automatic variable stack
   (ditto)
e) use another language (performance)
