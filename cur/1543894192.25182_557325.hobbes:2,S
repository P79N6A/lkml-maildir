I don't mind ripping them out, but it makes sense only if people are 
actually signed up to implementing this on a higher layer. As such, I'd 
need to get a sign-off from somebody actually involved in wireless mesh 
stuff etc.
Please? I do agree that the private iwpriv interface seems to be totally 
the wrong thing to do, but I want to see this as a first step towards a 
better situation, rather than just a "remove code that is ugly" issue!
Comments?
