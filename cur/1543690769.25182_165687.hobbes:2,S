	It's reasonable to expect that this will be the most common case and the
one to optimize. It is unreasonable to fail if this doesn't happen, since
it's not guaranteed to happen. Note that if by "without a context switch"
you really mean without another thread getting a chance to run, then it is
totally unreasonable. On SMP systems and with hyper-threading, threads can
run concurrently.
