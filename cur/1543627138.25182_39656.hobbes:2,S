Two cases:
a. proper shutdown -- somewhat OK to never fsck
b. unclean shutdown -- may involve kernel crashing
So with an unclean filesystem, _any_ avoidance of fsck is
suspect. I have a UPS; when my system boots on an unclean
filesystem it's because XFree86 thought it could run a
hardware driver in userspace.
Journalling gives you a nice list of recently-touched data
structures to examine. The phase-tree algorithm can support
low-cost incremental checksumming of the whole filesystem.
Soft-updates leave you with... well, is prayer any good?
You'd better run fsck at boot, which AFAIK is exactly what
is done; you even say "not include [...] background fsck".

I'm just tired of this: "Back when I used to use Linux 2.1.44 my
disks were trashed so bad that I lost everything! So use BSD."
Last time I checked, BSD fsck didn't have a set of regression tests
like ext2 fsck does. On the BSD mailing lists you can read about
fsck getting signal 11. So it's not God's Glorious Filesystem by
any means.
