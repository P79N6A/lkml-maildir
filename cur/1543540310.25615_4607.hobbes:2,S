Brian,
I looked into this a few weeks back.  I came to the conclusion that it
should not be done for 2.4.  Part of the discussion is at
http://www.wcug.wwu.edu/lists/netdev/200006/threads.html
 under "modular
net drivers".
There were basically two reasons for this.
A netdevice is entered into the kernel namespace via
'register_netdevice'.  For a modular driver, the registration occurs
from within to module constructor.  Once a driver has been registered,
all of its entry points are available for calling.
This means that once a driver has been insmodded, _any_ of its entry
points can be called while the module refcount is zero!  Current
practice is to increment the refcount in netdevice.open() and decrement
it in netdevice.close().  This is quite arbitrary and semi-pointless. 
It is valid and common to call netdevice functions on a device which has
not been "opened" - set_multicast_list, change_mtu, do_ioctl, etc.  The
netdevice open() and close() methods are misnamed - they should be
called "up" and "down".
So, given that netdevice methods are called while the module refcount is
zero, incrementing it in open() isn't a very pointful fix..
The second reason for leaving this alone is that it's already been taken
care of.
If you look carefully at net/core/dev.c and friends you'll see that
whenever a reference is taken to a netdevice its reference count is
incremented via dev_hold().  Whenever a reference is released the
device's refcount is dropped via dev_put().  This is a distinct refcount
from the module refcount.
So this is all very nice and correctly tracks when a netdevice is
"busy".  It is correct for _all_ netdevice methods, not just open() and
close().
The linkage between this refcount and the module refcount occurs in
unregister_netdevice().  This function is called from the module
destructor.  If it discovers that someone is unloading the driver's
module when the device is busy, it sleeps for up to ten seconds, waiting
for all references to be released (yes, it does this _after_ the driver
has been removed from the namespace).  If, after ten seconds the device
has not become unbusy we see the "Old style device leaked. Wait for
crash." message.
This last bit is pretty ugly, but, I suggest, good enough.
I agree that hoisting the MOD_INC and MOD_DEC out of the driver and into
the netdevice layer (as you have done) is preferable to the current way
of doing things.  It is a cleanup which centralises the knowledge of
module refcounts.  Be aware, however, that it breaks 2.2 compatibility
and the eepro100 and acenic maintainers (at least) will be after you
with a big stick :)  The solution I came up with was:
- create a new macro `SET_NETDEVICE_OWNER(dev)' for 2.4, and
  make this a no-op for 2.2 drivers.
- For 2.2-supporting drivers, leave the existing MOD_INC_USE_COUNT
  calls in place.  This means that the module refcounts for these
  drivers would go up and down by two, rather than by one, but this
  is OK.
I've attached here the patch which I came up with - you may care to
compare the dev_open() logic with your implementation.--- linux-2.4.0-test2/include/linux/netdevice.h	Sat Jun 24 15:39:47 2000
