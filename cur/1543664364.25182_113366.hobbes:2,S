Is this correct?  If smbfs is playing around with dentries which are on
dentry_unused and which have a zero refcount then these can be freed up at
any time.  The filesystem should have taken a ref on the dentry to prevent it
from being scavenged.
Isn't the bug over in smb_fill_cache(), which does:
	newdent = d_lookup(...);
	...
	ctl.cache->dentry[ctl.idx] = newdent;
	...
	dput(newdent);
I suspect we need to take an extra ref on the dentry when it is copied to the
cache, and put that ref back when smb_readdir() has finished using the dentry
(it looks like it's already doing that).
If so, the same problem is present in 2.4, but nobody noticed because 2.4 is
already using __dget_locked() and escapes the BUG check.
