Dear all,
 
I have a problem loading the rpm build locally on Fedora core 3, linux kernel 2.6.10.
 
After building the rpm file from the available sources on the Linux kernel 2.6.10 which was D/W from kernel.org and build, I am unable to load it.
 
It results in the following errors:-
tifm: version magic '2.6.10 686 REGPARM gcc-3.3' should be '2.6.10 REGPARM gcc-3.4'
 
Probably, It's only failing due to gcc version mismatch. 
When I look at the cc in /bin it points to gcc.3.4.
 
Can some one suggest me a solution for this issue?
 
Thanks a million for the helps.
 
Regards,
Mukund Jampala
