I have tried Linux 2.6.11 and 2.6.15. I've also tried the independent
variant of the driver, version 6.3.9 and 7.0.33. We've also tried Dell's
version for RHEL4 (5.7.6.1).
BIOS has been confirmed to be the latest version.

We haven't contacted Dell at this point no. Partly because we run Fedora
Core and not one of the supported dists (this will be a terminal server
so we want a more recent desktop on it).

We started doing this and discovered that the card started working when
we plugged it into a gigabit port (copper). ethtool still says fiber
though. So the immediate panic has settled. :)
It would still be nice to plug this into a 100 Mbps port since the
gigabit ports are a bit scarce.
