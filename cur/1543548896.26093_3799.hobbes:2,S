   However, this makes Linux incompatible with *BSD and Solaris, so
   I'm wondering what this "break existing programs" would be,
   portable programs would most likely not break by the API change.
Every Linux inetd in the world would instantly stop working.
The behavior is not changing, lets end this thread right now.
Later,
