This occurs when I first bootup and maybe at other times.  On bootup the kernel prints messages while the rc.d scripts are run.  I use shift+pageup to scroll back and read the messages.  I noticed today that not all the messages are visible when I scroll back.  Some are being "lost".  I will attach my .config file.
