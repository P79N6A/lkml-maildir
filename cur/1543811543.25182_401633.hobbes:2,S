Unfortunately, --bind is not an option for us.  The custom nfs-server
is actually a protocol adapter, mapping a custom filesystem spread
across a cluster of machines into NFS.  We have the loopback mount in
order to provide CIFS access via samba.  Looking at
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0407.3/0297.html
it certainly does seem like we're susceptible to this failure and are
looking at memory usage at the time of the crash.
Thanks,
Dave
