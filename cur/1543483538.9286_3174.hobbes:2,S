This is not any use without usable symbolic mapping information.  The
best way to get that is to compile the drivers into the main kernel
rather than as a module.  Alternatively, if you load the modules with
"insmod -m" you will get a map listing for the module which can be used
to lookup these symbolic addresses in the call trace.
