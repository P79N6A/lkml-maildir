No, the above is a theoretical argument about how optimizing disk access
and locking works that's in no way specific to Linux. Remember, hard RT is
trades throughput for latency guarantees. Worst case for this is devices
queues for disks. Go through the thought experiment of what happens when
an RT task and a !RT task interleave disk access. Worse, what happens when
they're creating files (and all the locking that entails) in the same
directory.
