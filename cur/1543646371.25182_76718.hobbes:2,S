Hi Matt,
I have a few comments.

Who do you want to accept these patches?
If it's Linus, you should send them to him.
Documentation/SubmittingPatches doesn't say so, but lately it's
become quite common and desirable to use diffstat output above
patches to summarize the files modified and how much they are
modified.
Instead of replying to other patches separately, I'll add a few
comments here.
CONFIG_DUMP:  I'd prefer to see something a little bit more descriptive,
like CONFIG_CRASH_DUMP or CONFIG_DUMP_KERNEL.  Yes, this is minor.
(BTW, I don't like the shortness of CONFIG_TRACE for LTT either.  :)
Why are all of the dump_init() and secondary init functions
_not_ marked as __init ?
You shouldn't need to call dump_init() explicitly since you use
module_init(dump_init);
Oh, I see, you call dump_init() for built-into-kernel but use
#ifdef MODULE
to surround lots of MODULE_xyz() lines.
You shouldn't surround the MODULE_xyz() lines like that,
they should always be present for MODULE or not,
and you should just use the module_init(dump_init) always to
initialize.
