Several main kernel developers use gcc-2.96 for their kernel development 
work and according to Alan Cox using gcc-2.96 for the kernel is fine (from 
a certain version onwards, can't remember the minimum release number he 
said but the one in RH 7.2 is fine in any case).
Considering the person asking was giving gcc-2.96 and gcc-3.x as choices, 
and was saying he is using RH 7.2, answering he should be using a third 
choice is IMO not a very constructive answer, considering one of the 
original choices is fine!
And anyway, the ultimate guide is the Documentation/Changes document in the 
kernel tree which states (cut'n'paste from kernel 2.4.15):
"The Red Hat gcc 2.96 compiler subtree can also be used to build this tree.
You should ensure you use gcc-2.96-74 or later. gcc-2.96-54 will not build
the kernel correctly."
So while you are right that gcc-2.95.3 or .4 is the recommended compiler, 
gcc-2.96 if an officially supported compiler, too. (-;
Best regards,
