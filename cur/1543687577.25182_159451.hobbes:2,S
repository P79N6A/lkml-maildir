Subject: 2.6.0-test3-bk8: why is CONFIG_ACPI_HT a dependency for CONFIG_ACPI?

I am not sure if I am missing something, but CONFIG_ACPI_HT is a
dependency for CONFIG_ACPI.
>From the description of CONFIG_ACPI_HT its used for enumerating logical
and physical processors. I have a single processor with no
hyperthreading, why do I need this feature enabled, is there something
the description is not saying?
This is under 2.6.0-test3-bk8.
