   Is it just me or is "make modules" broken.
   After doing a make modules there is no modules directory, no modules nothing
   (and yes I have some drivers, notably aic, setup to be modules)
   Pre-6 was ok
   Pre-8 was broken
   Pre-9 broken
   If I have missed an announcement - put egg on my face and point me in the
   right direction please
You need to get the latest modutils package.....
ftp.xx.kernel.org:/pub/linux/utils/kernel/modutils/v2.3
