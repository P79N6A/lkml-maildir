Marcin,
I just looked at your patch, but you make things much worse.
A kdev_t is a pointer, not a struct.
Going to a pointer is trivial, I have done it maybe ten times
the past four years. Look at earlier posts of mine maybe one or
two months ago.
So, code like
	if (!dev)
is OK - it tests whether the pointer is NULL.
On the other hand,
	if (!kdev_t_to_nr(dev))
is terrible.
Notice that kdev_t_to_nr is something the kernel never wants
to do - it is looking at certain numbers in the struct and
assembling them to something that is written in a filesystem
or returned by the stat call.
