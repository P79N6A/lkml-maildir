Subject: kernel space getcwd()? (using current() to find out cwd)

This is probably a stupid question, and probably directed to the wrong
list.  Apologies in advance, but I'm stumped
I've been working on a kernel module to report on "changed files". It
works just fine -- I wrap the orignal system calls with my
replacements which queue the filenames being modified, and when
another proccess reads from the device or proc entry, they get a nice
snapshot of what's going on in the system -- except that all the paths
are relative to the calling process.
So, a little ignorance being a dangerous thing, I thought I'd be clever
and manually reconstruct the full path by walking up
current->fs->pwd->d_parent and padding d_name to the filename until it
hits root.
Unfortunatly, this approach causes kernel panics.  e.g., the attached
code snippet will inevitably bring down the machine if I call it
during in my replacement open, mkdir, rmdir, unlink routines -- and
tehy all work fine without itq. 
What am I not getting? I do see, before I go down, that there's a few
occasions where current() is NULL... 
Apologies in advance for a wordy, probably stupid question, but I'm
stumped.   
If this is not the right approach for what I'm trying to do (e.g. a
kernel space getcwd()), can someone point me to something else I can try?
Thanks in advance,

----------------------------------------
(this is the greatly reduced version which does nothing but try and
reference current->fs->pwd)
void fill_full_path(char *name)
{ 
    if (current==NULL) 
    { 
#ifdef DEBUG
	  printk("ERROR! current == NULL\n"); 
#endif
	  return; 
    }
  if (current->fs==NULL) 
    { 
#ifdef DEBUG
	  printk("ERROR! current-> == NULL\n"); 
#endif
	  return; 
    }
  if (current->fs->pwd==NULL) 
    { 
#ifdef DEBUG
	  printk("ERROR! current->fs->pwd == NULL\n"); 
#endif
	  return; 
    }
    return; 
}
