it would be really interesting, it would be sort of an I/O coprocessor,
but unfortunately, it would half the PCI bandwidth (which is already a
problem with 10 Gbps) be cause the data would have to go from the NIC
to the copro then from the copro to system RAM.
Or if this copro contains large amounts of RAM, then the applications
can manipulate data directly on the card (and the copro could provide
remote memcpy, memmove, etc...), thus eliminating copies. But in this
case, it would require many modifications on both the kernel and the
application.

Then you should take a look at some hardware RAID controllers or even
some special intel NICs, both of which often come with an i960 or PPC
onboard. It might become a good start, and if you can show someting
interesting, we already know there's one guy here who can build the
full-speed CPU from the specs :-)
