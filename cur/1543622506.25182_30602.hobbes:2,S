I can get it to happen with 2.2.19 and 2.4.4-pre3 as well.
So I'm pretty sure the NFS server is doing too much work somewhere.
If it matters, it's a SMP kernel running on a dual 1ghz pIII system with 
2gb of memory. The filesystem resides on a linux kernel md RAID-5 array 
with 6 10,000 rpm disks. It's my understanding that the a machine this 
large should soak out the available network or disk bandwidth long 
before it became CPU bound serving NFS. I also did some raw IO tests to 
confirm that the md block device wasn't hogging up CPU time that was 
getting accounted to the nfsd kernel threads. I can soak that array 
pretty hard without soaking the CPU.
The closest machine configuration wise that I have access to is 
similarly configured, only with 3 disks instead of 6 and ext3 instead of 
reiserfs. Both machines were running exactly the same 2.4.17 image when 
I started having this problem. I can't reproduce the problem there, even 
when I do nasty things like run bonnie++ over NFS. (This isn't to say 
that nfsd is free on this other machine, but I'm seeing it use on the 
order of 2-4% CPU per nfsd thread with 8 threads and a load average of 
between 1 and 2 vs. 20+% and a load average of 8 on the other machine).
Thanks.
