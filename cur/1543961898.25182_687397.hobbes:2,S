No, that's not what I meant.  Now that we have a means of specifying
a configuration file by name, it would be nice if the file name could,
for example, be appended to EXTRAVERSION.  That's all it would
take to duplicate the behavior I misdescribed.
Eg. `make K=HPxw4300.config ...' would have "-HPxw4300" appended
to EXTRAVERSION.  Maybe this doesn't make sense any more, but it
was once something I wanted very much.
