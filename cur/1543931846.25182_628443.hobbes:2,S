Agreed.

No. The code as written above should reduce to:
	if (val == NULL)
		return -EFAULT;
If I hadn't wanted to return -EFAULT in this case, I would have just written:
	WARN_ON(val == NULL);
I don't want code that was running safely (ie returning -EFAULT) to
start crashing the system just because I've, say, disabled printk.
That's creating an obnoxious heisenbug.

Then I kindly submit that you should instead withdraw the code that
allows you to use WARN_ON in a condition in the first place.
Note that Dave Jones is currently poking at making WARN_ON
out-of-line, so you're liable to collide with him.
