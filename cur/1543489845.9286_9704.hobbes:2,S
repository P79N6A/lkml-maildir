It can already do this kind of stuff. You could even set the GNU linker
to allow the link and warn about the use of private symbols

If they static link they have to provide object modules for relinking
under the LGPL. Star Office may be nasty and bloated in places but I think
the people complaining at a vendor for not supporting a library version
thats not even released in a commercial distribution yet is a bit much.
Especially as they do tell you how to make sure it uses the old library
