Consider the recent S3-specific vesafb hacks.  It shouldn't be too hard,
after you detect an S3 chip, to fill in the mmio_start/mmio_len fields
in struct fb_info with useful values.  Once those values are filled in,
X should be able to accelerate the chip.

Would you mind elaborating on this?  If I have a vesafb hacked to
support S3 and mmio as above, and a custom S3 driver, wouldn't
{check,request,release}_mmio, along with the existing
{check,request,release}_region, help make sure that those two drivers
don't collide?
Thanks,
