> How much is significant? The term doesn't really help much. I will say that with one NIC taking 120MB/sec of data to a TB database and copying to two other machine (~220MB)  my interrupts got up in in the 5k-12k range with essentially CPU0 doing the work, some few percent going to CPU2.
1010 per second, IIRC. Try this patch:
