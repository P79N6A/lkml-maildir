I have FUP'ing to myself, but sometimes you just have to.

It seems this only occurs when I type "real fast". If I do 2 keys a second
the messages won't appear. Maybe this might have to do with Toshiba's
key-repeat rate problem, as discussed with Linus, Alan, various X11
coders and this list as a whole earlier. (More info -> google news ->
'toshiba repeating keys')

Ok, just happened again after I tried shutdown -r'ing my laptop.
This time there's more information on the screen, and I Hope This Helps:
