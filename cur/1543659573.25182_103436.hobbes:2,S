Easy!  Use the rdtsc instruction to obtain the number of CPU cycles
that occur between two subsequent calls. There will be some 'noise'
because of interrupt activity so make many tests, put the results
into an array, remove the slowest and the fastest, then average
the remaining data. That's good enough for "government projects".

Why is the government concerned about the lunatic fringe? Think about it.
