I have no problem with this since we can then use Nico's swp-based
implementation.  Great!  What seems to be happening though is that
there's a move to make these operations be generic across all
architectures.
What both Nico and myself have demonstrated is that if architectures
are placed into the generic strait-jacket, any alleged performance
benefit of mutexes is completely swamped, which in turn makes the
whole mutex idea entirely pointless.
