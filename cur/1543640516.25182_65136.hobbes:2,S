This just doesn't make sense. When a device is inserted or a driver is
loaded, the bus tries to attach devices to a driver by comparing the
hardware ID of a device to the list of supported IDs of a driver. This is
handled at the bus level because the format of the ID and the semantics
for matching them are bus-specific.
Regardless, it happens automatically. It just doesn't make sense to let 
people try and bind a device to some random driver. 
Suppose we did support this. If you write the name of a driver to a file, 
we search the bus's list of drivers for a match. We then let the bus 
compare the hardware IDs and call probe if it matches. 
One big problem is that the IDs in the driver are marked __devinitdata, so
they're thrown away after init (if hotplugging is not enabled). So, we 
would have to change every driver. 
Besides, it just doesn't make sense. If $user wants to use a different 
or third party driver, let them rmmod and insmod.

Yes.
