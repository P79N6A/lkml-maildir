Here is some additional and hopefully helpful information.
Without CONFIG_ACPI=y, I first got:
arch/i386/kernel/setup.c: In function 'setup_arch':
arch/i386/kernel/setup.c:1571: warning: implicit declaration of function 'acpi_boot_table_init'
arch/i386/kernel/setup.c:1572: warning: implicit declaration of function 'acpi_boot_init'
and then at the end:
arch/i386/kernel/built-in.o(.init.text+0x1b81): In function `setup_arch':
: undefined reference to `acpi_boot_table_init'
arch/i386/kernel/built-in.o(.init.text+0x1b86): In function `setup_arch':
: undefined reference to `acpi_boot_init'
make: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
With these set linux-2.6.12-rc2-mm1 built OK.
[steven@spc1 linux-2.6.12-rc2-mm1]$ grep ^CONFIG_ACPI .config
CONFIG_ACPI=y
CONFIG_ACPI_BOOT=y
CONFIG_ACPI_INTERPRETER=y
CONFIG_ACPI_BLACKLIST_YEAR=0
CONFIG_ACPI_BUS=y
CONFIG_ACPI_EC=y
CONFIG_ACPI_POWER=y
CONFIG_ACPI_PCI=y
CONFIG_ACPI_SYSTEM=y
