Subject: [PATCH] ibmtr.c, kernel 2.2.7
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I made a small patch to ibmtr.c (2.2.7) to stop it from throwing away
non-TCP/IP frames
(i.e. sap != 0xAA).  I have tested it using SNA 802.2 (sap=0x04), but it
would be nice if
anyone with an IBM Token-Ring adapter could test it to check that it doesn't
have any
adverse effects on TCP/IP (or anything else).
BTW, in case anyone is interested in SNA, I modified parts of Tim Alpaerts
802.2 LLC
code (net/802/*llc* and include/net/llc*) as part of a 3270 project I am
working on.
The 802/LLC code in the 2.2 kernel has some vital bits missing -- the
changes needed
to make it work can be found at
