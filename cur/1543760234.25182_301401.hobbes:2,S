So I've talked to the Solaris implementors about this issue. They said
that the above behaviour on their clients was a bug that they've
corrected in Solaris 10.
Given that very few people are going to be using Solaris clients with
NFSv2 against a Linux server, and given that there is always the option
of compiling the server without NFSACL support for those few who need to
do this, I suggest we just drop this patch.
Cheers,
  Trond
