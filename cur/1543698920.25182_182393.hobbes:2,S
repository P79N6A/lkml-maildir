Thanks William.
I may be missing something a little more basic: I have a contiguous physical
memory area (IO memory), and I want to manage it with struct pages.  If I'm
to write to the page I need to kmap it, therefore (as I understand it) I
need to zero the ->virtual field.   What I don't understand is how, given
the struct page I've allocated and filled out, is the page correlated with
the correct physical memory.  Where do I put the information that struct
page X points to physical address Y, so that when I kmap(X) I get a virtual
address pointing to Y?
Thanks,
Amir.

I'm not entirely sure this is safe (I don't know of anything doing it off
the top of my head or any guarantee it should work), but PG_reserved is an
absolute requirement at the very least. ->virtual is likely irrelevant.
Also, COW userspace mappings of such beasts are illegal since the physical
address can't be calculated for do_wp_page() to do its copy. Codepaths
assuming it's in a zone and so on must also be avoided. You'll need to set
VM_RESERVED on the vma, since the page structure can't be looked up via
pte_page(). If you want faults handled on it, you'll also have to define
your own ->nopage() method.
I generally prefer setting VM_RESERVED and prefaulting in ->f_op->mmap(),
though that may not be feasible in some scenarios. Handling this would be
much easier if drivers could override fault handling methods and the like.
