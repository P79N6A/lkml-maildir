FWIW, I went ahead and built a fedora 10 i686 xen guest and tried to
reproduce this there (kernel 2.6.27.9-159.fc10.i686). I assigned the
guest the same IPv6 address that your client is using and tried the
exact same mount string.
Everything seems to work as expected, and I don't see any neighbor
solicitations for bogus IPv6 addrs.
The best thing I can suggest at this point is to try inserting some
debug printk's at various points where the IPv6 address is parsed and
see if you can determine at what point the address becomes corrupted.
