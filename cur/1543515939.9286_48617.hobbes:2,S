Not much.  It would speed up by at most a constant factor: we'd have
fewer syscalls involved, but we still have to do a read() or write()
syscall for any fds returned, so we are still O(x) where x is the number
of live fds since the last check.
It is worthwhile doing this, definitely, but it won't actually change
the scalability: just the absolute performance.
