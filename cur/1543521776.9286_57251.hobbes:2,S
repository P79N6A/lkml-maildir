Subject: Bad Floppy buffering in Verion 2.3.36

I make an ext2 file-system on /dev/fd0, mount the file system,
add some files, install a boot-loader (LILO), then unmount the
file-system.
I wait until the floppy LED is off.
Then I `cp /dev/fd0 raw.dat`.  This should be an image of everything
on the device. 
However, it isn't. What LILO wrote is missing. I have to eject the
floppy, then reinsert the floppy. Then, `cp /dev/fd0 raw.dat` gives
me the correct contents of the device.
I can also execute this code-snippet to achieve the same result.
    if((fd = open(floppy, O_RDWR)) < 0)
    {
        fprintf(stderr, "Can't open %s\n", floppy);
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    if(ioctl(fd, FDFLUSH, NULL) < 0)
    {
        fprintf(stderr, "Bad ioctl(FDFLUSH)\n");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
Somebody isn't invalidating buffers when the floppy is unmounted.
In all cases, the floppy contents are correct. It's just that
'memory' contents are not, and memory contents are being used for
the next device access.
Cheers,
