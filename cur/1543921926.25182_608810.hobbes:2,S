Hi Christoph,

Yeah, but we're _not failing_ when debugging is enabled. Thus, it's
likely, that the _failing_ (non-debug) case has potential for more
order 0 allocs, no? I am just guessing here but maybe it's
slab_order() behaving differently from calculate_slab_order() so that
we see more order 0 pressure in SLUB than SLAB?
