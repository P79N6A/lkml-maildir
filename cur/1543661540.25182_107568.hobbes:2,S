IANAL.
In fact, most of the people on this list are not lawyers, so maybe
we're not the most appropriate people to answer your query.

Section 3 seems to apply when a binary is redistributed, and my reading
of section 3b leads me to understand that it would only apply if all
of the following are satisfied:
1. A distributed a binary image to B.
2. A accompanied it with a written offer under section 3b.
3. A did not supply the source code corresponding to that
   binary as per 3a.

Does the site allow you to download a binary kernel image?  If the
answer is "no" then there isn't a problem here since section 3 does
not apply (no distribution of the program in object code or
executable form).
