I'll vote for a. An open merge window over the holidays possible results
in needless stresses for the developers at a time which some of them
want to use otherwise. Or if any merge introduces bad bugs and the
developers that can fix it are on xmax vacation we may end up with an
unusable upstream tree for a week or so. Same with merge conflicts.
So, I'd suggest to wait until everybody is back to work until opening
the merge window.
