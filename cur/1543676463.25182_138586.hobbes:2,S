bugzilla.kernel.org has long complained about make *docs (See entry 228).
This updates docbook and some sourcefile to make it compile with success.
When building sgmldocs a lot of warnings are now issued about
parameters with no description. A good sign that comments needs an update.
There is no functional changes in sis900.c and kmod.c - only docbook
related changes.

   docbook: Move definition of MODULENAME_SIZE
   
   The location between the comment and the prototype confused kernel-doc.
   Kernel-doc requires the prototype to follow after the comment section.
<sam@mars.ravnborg.org> (03/06/07 1.1316.1.3)
   docbook: Warn about missing parameter definitions
   
   Previously kernel-doc silently ignored missing parameter descriptions
   but sometimes 'make sgmldocs' failed with exit code > 0.
   When kernel-doc encounter parameters where the description is missing
   it now prints a warning.
   docproc corrected so previously exit code are recorded.
   docbook makefile cleaned up a bit
<sam@mars.ravnborg.org> (03/06/07 1.1316.1.2)
   docbook: Recognize sis900 functions
   
   Adapted comments to follow what kernel-doc (docbook) understands
<sam@mars.ravnborg.org> (03/06/07 1.1316.1.1)
   docbook/kernel-api: include files updated
   
   Path to pci_hotplug_core corrected.
   Added !Eli/string.h to document strlcpy and friends
