If a driver or subsystem already uses a prefix to have an own namespace
for macros, functions, structs and so on, a local DEBUG_DRIVER could
become something like LOCALPREFIX_DEBUG. If there is a narrow usage of
the macro, e.g. to indicate a debug level, it could become something
speaking like LOCALPREFIX_DEBUG_LEVEL. --- However, after looking at the
actual occurrences of DEBUG_DRIVER, I see that this recommendation
doesn't really apply that well.
From your initial post:
| $ $ grep -rw DEBUG_DRIVER *
| drivers/net/sunlance.c:#undef DEBUG_DRIVER
This is an old forgotten rest of earlier debug code. See here for evidence:
http://lxr.linux.no/source/drivers/net/sunlance.c?v=2.2.26#L791
791 #ifdef DEBUG_DRIVER
792         printk (KERN_DEBUG "Lance restart=%d\n", status);
793 #endif
This usage of DEBUG_DRIVER isn't there anymore. Therefore simply delete
the remaining occurrence:
-#undef DEBUG_DRIVER
| drivers/net/a2065.c:#ifdef DEBUG_DRIVER
| drivers/net/a2065.c:#ifdef DEBUG_DRIVER
Rename to A2065_DEBUG or LANCE_DEBUG. Two more alternatives:
-#ifdef DEBUG_DRIVER
+#if 0 /* debug */
or
-#ifdef DEBUG_DRIVER
-	years_old_debug_cruft_nobody_enables_anymore();
-#endif
Needless to say, the maintainer certainly wants to ACK/NAK this.
| drivers/net/7990.c:#ifdef DEBUG_DRIVER
| drivers/net/7990.c:#ifdef DEBUG_DRIVER
Exactly like with a2065.c.
| drivers/base/Kconfig:config DEBUG_DRIVER
According to where it is defined, CONFIG_DEBUG_DRIVER should only occur
in drivers/base/* (and some defconfigs outside of drivers/base/).
| ...
More hits from LXR:
drivers/isdn/hardware/eicon/dbgioctl.h
Where is this header file used anyway? Can the entire file be deleted?
drivers/isdn/gigaset/gigaset.h  (definition as enum item)
drivers/isdn/gigaset/common.c   (multiple uses)
If the overlap with CONFIG_DEBUG_DRIVER bothers you, rename it to
DEBUG_DRIVER_STRUCT or whatever.
