Perhaps I should clarify.  I don't see a way to implement the additional
syncookie enhancements without storing an offset in some type of
per-socket structure.  Given that, is it still deemed too high of a cost?
Is enhancing syncookies not deemed important enough to warrant the
additional 4 bytes?  What if there was an additional config variable to
support arbitrary/random tcp timestamps, and then syncookies only used
the additional options when that setting was chosen?  Is there some
possiblity I'm missing that could get this feature in a form suitable
for inclusion?  Thanks.
