Not exactly. There are quite a few Motherboards with ECC support on stadard
memory with parity bit. Idea is the following: since there are 64bit bus
anyway you can use 8parity bits (full byte!) for each 8bytes to implement ECC !
Of course SIMM's with fake parity bit will screw such motherboard like
a hell :-/
