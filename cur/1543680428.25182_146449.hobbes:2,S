I'm not sure if there is a problem, but one example to consider is the 
following:
If a process is running with realtime priority 99 totally consuming the 
system, and an /sbin/hotplug process is started by the kernel because of 
a device insert or remove, /sbin/hotplug will never be scheduled if it 
runs with standard priority. If that service depends on those hotplug 
events, it will never see them (even though they have occured). Since 
I'm no scheduler expert, I don't know if this is actually how the system 
would behave.... I do know that it would be desireable to have 
/sbin/hotplug always run even if other processes in the system are 
running in realtime priority....
