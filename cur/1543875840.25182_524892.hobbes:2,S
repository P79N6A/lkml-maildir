The other activity I referred to was the massive amount of crap like
mremap(), gettimeofday(), open()/close()/etc., spinning in userspace,
etc. that kernel compiles do. An otherwise quiescent system is a
distinct prerequisite for validity. Most of what you've "proven" with
the kernel compile is that pagetable construction is probably not a
significant portion of kernel compiles and not anything about relative
speed apart from eager construction being unquantifiably slower.

Bad quoting; this is reminiscent of PR hackery where subsequences of
words from the middle of sentences are cut out with audio editors in
order to form an embarrassing quote. The full paragraph:

I'd also appreciate if it were mentioned who actually wrote this, given
that the patch posted was what I sent you verbatim (and actually
requested you not post for good reasons, some centering around pageattr.c).
The salient point from the above, which was conveniently omitted, was
"it's all dominated by PTE caching." However, even this needs some
qualification having to do with the VSZ of the parent process in fork().
For very small processes, such as cannot be constructed with glibc due
to its massive bloat and cannot be constructed with the standard process
address space layouts due to stacks being too distant from text and
heap, PTE's actually don't substantially outnumber PMD's et al, so
there is more to this story.
