Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi!
The attached patch puts the following functions into the .text.init
section.
aha1542_in
        called by aha1542_getconfig, aha1542_query (all initfuncs)
aha1542_mbenable
        called by aha1542_query (initfunc)
aha1542_in1
        called in aha1542_mbenable (now also an initfunc)
Patch is against 2.4.4pre1.
Regards,
	Matze
