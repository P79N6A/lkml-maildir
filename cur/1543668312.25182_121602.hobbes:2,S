I did this and it works.  I had /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth[01]
but I only want one of them alive, so I renamed ifcfg-eth1 to
not-ifcfg-ethbackup  (since the ifcfg* files are searched for as /ifcfg*/).
Then I renamed ifcfg-eth0 to ifcfg-ethmain and (by using advice from
the thread on "NICs trading places ?"), I used 'nameif' to name the
eth0 interface to 'ethmain' by making an /etc/mactab file containing:
ethmain     mac.address.for.live.interface
and I modified /etc/rc.d/init.d/network to run 'nameif' to change
the interface names as listed in the /etc/mactab file.
