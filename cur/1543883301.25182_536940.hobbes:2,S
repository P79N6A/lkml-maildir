you're conflating those two again.  here's my last attempt -- see the
definitions here:
http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/conform.html
and note the fundamental distinction:
deprecated:  "... User agents should continue to support deprecated
                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
elements for reasons of backward compatibility..."
obsolete:  "... no guarantee of support by a user agent."
                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  that's it -- there's the fundamental difference.  i really don't
care if you can find other wordings that you can interpret
differently.  in *my* proposal, those two definitions are not
orthogonal, they are mutually exclusive.  period.  end of discussion.
if you can't accept that, feel free to submit your own proposal.
