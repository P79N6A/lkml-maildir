I'm slightly concerned that to find a given tag by its name if we do
_just_ the above would be a fairly slow process. I suspect you'll want
a .git/tags/ directory _anyway_, but with named files which refer to tag
objects, instead of directly to commit objects as in Petr's current
implementation.
Other operations we might want to be at least _reasonably_ efficient
would include 'show me the latest tag from Linus' and 'show me all
extant tags'.
