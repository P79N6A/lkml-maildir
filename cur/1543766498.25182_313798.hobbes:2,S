Shouldn't this be
     dlm_recover_stopped(ls) and not test_bit()?
?

Rather than wrap an infinite loop in an infinite loop, since all you
really want the second loop for is a periodic gurantee of
recover_timer seconds, wouldn't it be easier to have a sof-timer set
up to go off in that amount of time, and have it's callback do an
unconditional wake-up on the local wait-queue then mod_timer the timer
back in? Or might there be other tasks sleeping on the same
wait-queue? At that point, since your code does not seem to care about
signals (uses interruptible version, but doesn't check for
signal_pending() return value from wait_event), you probably could
just use the stock version of wait_event(). The conditions would be
checked in wait_event() on the desired periodic basis, just as they
are now, but maybe slightly more efficiently (and cleaner code, IMO :)
). If you do *need* interruptible, please put in a comment as to why.
Maybe we need yet another interface? :)

500 ms is a long time! What's the justification? No comments?
Especially considering you will wake up on *every* signal. It's
unlikely you'll actually sleep for 500 ms. Also, please use
msleep_interruptible(), unless you expect to be woken by  wait-queues
(I didn't have enough time to trace all the possible code paths :) )
-- in which case, make it explicit with comments, please.
Thanks,
Nish
