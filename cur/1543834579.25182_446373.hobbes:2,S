OK.

Removing symlinks seems like a good idea.  Leaving them around might cause
a subsequent driver load to fail due to EEXIST (assuming that the caller
checks error codes, as if).
I assume you're referring to error paths here?

Yes, this was nasty (oopses).

But I made bus_attach_device() convert the positive return value to zero. 
See
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.18-rc1/2.6.18-rc1-mm2/hot-fixes/drivers-base-check-errors-fix.patch.
Is there a reason to propagate this irritating "1" back out of
bus_attach_device() as well?
