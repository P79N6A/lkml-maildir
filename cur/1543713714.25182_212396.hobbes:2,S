Hi,
 I have a question regarding the behavior of sigsuspend() sys call when 
it receives more than one signals from its signal set simultaneously.
It is known that sigsuspend returns only after the signal catching 
function returns. So if sigsuspend receives more than one signals at the 
same time, would it return after "both" handlers return or after the 
first handler returns ?
Any help on this would be more than appreciated,
Thanks,
Shvetima.
