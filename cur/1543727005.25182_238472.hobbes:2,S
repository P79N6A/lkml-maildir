First of all, please excuse me if I don't make any sense at all - I really 
don't know anything about generating good random numbers and good sources 
of entropy, but I had a few thoughts while reading this thread and just 
thought I'd mention them in case there was actually something useful in 
them.
How about using some of the following as early sources of entropy (keeping 
in mind that this early on we just want something a little less 
predictable since completely unpredictable is probably impossible) : 
As you yourself mentioned; hardware serial numbers.
The clock of course, although the predictability of that was what started 
this thread, it's still a source.
The time the first (or first few) interrupts happen (any interrupt)? I'm 
guessing there must be *some* interrupts that the hardware generates for 
all boxes (and even if there's not for a few boxes, then that in itself 
is data), and if the hardware differs from box to box, then this would 
also differ between boxes.
The RAM size could provide a number that, although easily discovered, 
would often differ from box to box, same goes for CPU clock frequency 
(which I've often observed differs slightly even amongst supposedly 
identical CPU's).
How about the BIOS version? BIOS manufacturer string or similar info that 
could potentially differ between boxes?
What about the value of some semi-randomly picked memory locations? Or is 
all memory initialized to a known value? (could it be read before being 
initialized?).
How about the build time/build nr of the kernel? Again, easily 
discoverable, but if the main problem is boxes booting at same time 
getting same initial random numbers, then this could differentiate them at 
least a bit if they had different kernels.
If a few (or all) of the above where used to provide a few bits of 
entropy each, wouldn't that combined give enough difference between boxes 
and provide enough sources to make the final result (at least a bit) less 
easily guessed?
There is of course a big possibility that I'm completely wrong, but I just 
wanted to mention my thoughts in case they would be of use.
