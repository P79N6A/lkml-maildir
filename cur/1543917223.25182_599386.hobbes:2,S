Hi,
We have observed 40ms latency spikes in TCP connections in "burst" type of traffic. This affects regular TCP sockets. We observed this issue in kernels of 2.4.21 and kernel 2.6.5.  
Aparently, this seems to be fixed in 2.6.19.  
Can someone throw some light on this? 
Is this a congestion control/avoidance issue? What congestion control algorithm is used before 2.6.8?   
Thanks
Rajib
