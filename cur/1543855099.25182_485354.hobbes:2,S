At the second thought, I think this should be done in 
ahci_init_controller().
* Unlike Jmicron's case, this doesn't affect PCI bus scan.  Actually, it 
does change class code but that's not as disruptive as Jmicron's case 
and as long as ahci ignores class code, it doesn't really matter. 
Driver can be chosen by changing loading order - this is both plus and 
minus.
* As Arjan pointed out, that unlock-modify-lock sequence should be done 
on resume too.  ahci_init_controller() is the right place for such 
stuff.  This chip is going into notebooks, right?
