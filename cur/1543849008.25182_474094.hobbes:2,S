There seems to be a slight problem with doing that. Running
`ldd /bin/bash` prints out
	linux-gate.so.1 =>  (0xffffe000)
and the topmost address a kernel function can return is 0xFFFFf000 when 
MAX_ERRNO=4095, but that is going to be tight with the vdso mapped at 
0xffffE000.
Or is ldd giving wrong output? Because actually, `cat /proc/$$/maps` 
($$=bash) says it is mapped a lot less high:
a7fbe000-a7fbf000 r-xp a7fbe000 00:00 0          [vdso]
(CONFIG_COMPAT_VDSO=y, CONFIG_PAGE_OFFSET=0xB0000000, 2.6.18)
