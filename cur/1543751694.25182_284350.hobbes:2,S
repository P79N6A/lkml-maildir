+To understand all the Linux-USB framework, you'll use these resources:

+      includes kerneldoc that should help you get a current overview.

+      "gadget.pdf" for peripheral side.)  Also, Documentation/usb has
+      more information.
+
+    * The USB 2.0 specification (from www.usb.org), with supplements
+      such as those for USB OTG and the various device classes.
+      The USB specification has a good overview chapter, and USB
+      peripherals conform to the widely known "Chapter 9".
+
+    * Chip specifications for USB controllers.  Examples include
+      host controllers (on PCs, servers, and more); peripheral
+      controllers (in devices with Linux firmware, like printers or
+      cell phones); and hard-wired peripherals like Ethernet adapters.
+
+    * Specifications for other protocols implemented by USB peripheral
+      functions.  Some are vendor-specific; others are vendor-neutral
+      but just standardized outside of the www.usb.org team.
