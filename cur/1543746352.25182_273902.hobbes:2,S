The last two (currently numbered 1.2219,12220).

#   acpi: disable PCI links at boot again, fix ELCR
#   
#   Len Brown convinced me that the problem with disabling
#   PCI routing entries wasn't the disable as much as the
#   fact that ELCR needs to be updated when removing the PCI
#   routing. So this reverts the previous cset and updates
#   ELCR as suggested by Len.

#   acpi: don't disable PCI irq links that were active at boot.
#   
#   This fixes at least some interrupt polarity setup cases.
#   The ACPI guys may want to eventually do this differently, but
#   in the meantime this makes ACPI behaviour closer to non-ACPI
#   behaviour, and fixes known problems.
#   
#   I'll further argue that this protects non-PCI devices that may
#   just share the irq routing from being screwed, but that may or
#   may not be an argument that everybody buys into.
