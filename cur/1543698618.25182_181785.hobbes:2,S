We've exchanged some email with support@bitmover.com, and they've been a great help.
Really, there are two things.
The first is triggers. The Mozilla tinderbox is driven by triggers from CVS commits.
I believe that triggers are resevered for the commercial version of BK.
However, unlike CVS, BK has a nice way of asking the remote repository if new changes exist,
so we really don't need a trigger to tell us when to start a build. 
Instead, we run the timestamp column on a cron, so it is constantly incrementing.
( Mozilla only increments their timestamp column when a trigger is recieved ) 
The change from trigger-driven to time-driven timestamps meant we didn't try 
to create a link between timestamp->source commit. Again, since Mozilla is
trigger driven, they have this link.
So, the second piece is linking either the time-stamp column or the build machine column
directly to a Web-based view of the code. BkWeb already provides the view. 
The main issue here is finding the proper syntax for the bkweb url so we get 
all of the changesets included in the commit. We've recieved a few examples from
your support people, and we're using one currently.
