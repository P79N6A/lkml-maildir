No kidding.  If you're running with this new security model, you should
re-think running system binaries over nfs.  This, btw, is not just my own
opinion.

I've tried to avoid using 'bad' unless I was saying something like
'marking named(8) is bad', which is obvious.  You have to say _why_ it's
bad if it's not obvious.  It only seems so obvious to you because you
haven't really given more than a few second's thought to the solution,
evidenced by your misunderstanding about the immutable bit relationship.

Now _that_ is quite obviously absurdly bad.

What the HECK are you talking about?  You sit down at a Linux box that is
exporting /usr to a new box?  Then you edit the binaries on /usr (or
create new ones) that do bad things on the new box?  If you can do that,
then you might as well just create a whole fleet of setuid-root binaries.
If you can't trust the /usr on another machine completely, you damn well
shouldn't be mounting it over nfs!

Again, what the heck are you talking about?  Whether we use the immutable
bit that's ext2 specific, or new caps metadata in ext3, you get the same
end result!!!  (except that using sticky/immutable won't break current
tools, a major benefit)

If you're trusting remote executables that shouldn't be trusted, that is
just bad administration.

Yes.  Please go read and think and understand why a mis-implementation of
capabilities is at best a small step forward in security, and a large step
backward for adminstrators who will one day have a correct implementation
of capabilities to work with.  (ext3 + cap metadata)

That's an abomination, and now you're screwing around with traditional fs
rights.  Again, just _try_ to get this code in the kernel.  No way.

Yes, everybody knows this.  Of course, an iso is by default immutable, so
you can safely burn a sticky bit capabilities fs on it, and so it works
right away, and preserves correct capability semantics.
setuid0:
- setting inheritable caps is a non-priviledged operation, but it should
be.  (this means that, in many cases you have to remove all write rights
to the file, otherwise the file owner can always max-out inheritable)
- if you want to set permitted, you have to make the file setuid root;
setting permitted is a good idea for things like 'named' as I've shown.  
- if the file is not setuid root, you use the uid and setuid bit from the
filesystem, otherwise you read it from the binary.  this is an ugly break
in UNIX fs semantics.
Albert, in particular you don't seem to understand just how important the
inheritable bits are in a capability-based security system, and how bad it
is to not require setting them to be priviledged.  Or at least, if you
want it to be priviledged, now you have to mark it setuid root.
Apparently it's time for me to do some coding, since logic has no meaning
here.  I only hope that you won't license your cap setting utility 'GPL
except for David Parsley, who can neither use it nor even look at it.'
