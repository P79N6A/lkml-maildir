Ahh. Will apply.
Just out of interest: did we have such code and it just happened to use a 
register, or was this found because you wrote some new code that triggered 
something that had just never been triggered before? Or is there a newer 
gcc that is better at optimizations and finds a constant propagation where 
it used to not find it?
Inquiring minds..
