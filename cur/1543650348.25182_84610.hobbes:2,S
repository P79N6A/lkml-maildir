I'm runnig 2.4.19 and Debian (but I compile my own kernel from the
sources).  ext3 is forcing the block device to be read only when I run
out of inodes, and the only way out is reboot (that I could tell).
This is wrose than a good deal of kernel panics I've had.  Is
2.4.20prewhatever any better with reguard to this error?
My system is running low on inodes (my fault), and back when I was
using ext2 everything was fine, I would run out, the kernel would give
the message about no more space on disk for everything that needed an
inode until I freed up some.  With ext3 I get one message saying no
more space on disk and then everything else gives, readonly file
system.
After I hit the problem accidently, I verified running out of inodes
was the problem on purpose.  I would hate to think that I had to
reboot everytime I filled up my harddrive, and it is an equally bad
behavior to reboot when I run out of inodes.
Here is some dmesg output.
