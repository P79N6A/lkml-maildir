No. The diffstat looks huge because you moved "hid_blacklist" into a 
header file, and that is a big enough change that git won't consider the 
rename to be just a rename any more (you basically moved the old 
usbdrivers/usb/input/hid-core.c file into *two* files: hid-core.c and 
usbhid.h).
Why do that? It now gets included INTO EVERY DAMN FILE that includes 
<usbhid.h>, since that one now has that
	static const struct hid_blacklist
definition in it. Yet *nothing* wants it, except for the one C file that 
it used to be in.
No way in hell will I include this kind of crap without major explanations 
for why the "crap" is not crap. And quite frankly, I don't think such 
explanations exist.
I'm also not going to pull it if you just add a new commit to undo the 
idiocy. That thing needs to be totally re-done, as far as I'm concerned. I 
don't want to touch anything that has EVER even *seen* anything that 
stupid.
Yes, I'm grumpy. I don't like big changes at this stage, and if they are 
also STUPID big changes, as this seems to be, I refuse to pull them 
entirely.
