If you are using some reverse masquerading techinques (like ipautofw)
then it may happen that the kernel chooses the local port number for
outgoing connections from the range that the masquerade helper uses.
It results in just the same symptoms - no outgoing connections, incoming
and masquerade still work. When a big-enough number of connections fail
then the local port number gets out of the forwarded range and it works
again.
