Subject: [PATCH] Serial-Core: adds atomic context debug code.

 Andrew,
 While porting the USB-Serial layer to the Serial Core API [1], we found that
usb-serial devices must be able to sleep in the get_mctrl() and set_mctrl()
callbacks [2]. But, unfortunately, those callbacks are called with a spinlock
held.
 The solution is to switch from the spinlock to a mutex.
 But turns out that we have no sure whether uart_update_mctrl(),
uart_startup() and uart_configure_port() (which calls {get,set}_mctrl()) are
called from atomic context or not.
 This patch adds might_sleep() calls to them in order to help us to find the
answer.
 Please, note that this is just a debug patch to stay in -mm for a while,
ie, it's not a submission for mainline kernel.
