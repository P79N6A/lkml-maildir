Thanks!
Could you have a look at the remaining differences and tell me what else
can be nuked?
* For the CONFIG_X86_NUMAQ stuff there were some patches flying around,
  but it seems they never got applied.
* The hand-coded stack is probably a bootloader thing, but I don't yet
  understand why it's only in i386.
* The "uncompressing" messages differ. Any reason for that?
* The list of includes differs. Probably related to NUMAQ and stack.
* decompress_kernel is asmlinkage only on i386.
