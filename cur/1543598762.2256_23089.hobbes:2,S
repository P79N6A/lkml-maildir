I had some lockups too when I went to the 2.4 kernels.  I ended up removing
a SCSI card, and adding a fan to cool off my computer.  I was up for 12 days
recently before I noticed that my USB printer wasn't working, and I saw I
had compiled the wrong USB controllers into my kernel.  It has now been up
for almost 4 days now with a properly configured stock 2.4.8 kernel.

Yes, I have seen it happen a couple times before
I started X, within a couple minutes of boot completing.
