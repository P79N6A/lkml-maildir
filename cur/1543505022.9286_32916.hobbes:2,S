Well, I don't have the CD that it did it with anymore but when I did it
yesterday this showed up in the logs :
Aug  6 03:29:12 tt2 kernel: attempt to access beyond end of device 
Aug  6 03:29:12 tt2 kernel: 0b:00: rw=0, want=532574, limit=532572 
Chuck I will try to get the CD back again tomorrow or Monday, and see if
it does it again.
Cheers Mof.
