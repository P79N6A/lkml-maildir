Subject: [PATCH]  Unresolved symbol compile error on non-PCI PC systems
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Folks,
    in the file arch/i386/kernel/dmi_scan.c, there are two unresolved 
symbols when this file is compiled for a system without PCI support.
    The following patch fixes this.  Patch applies against 2.4.21-pre5-ac3.
    As I do not know for sure if there are other issues related with 
this patch, I would like that someone double-checks it.  There is also a 
possibility that this fix applies to the 2.5 kernel tree.
Regards,
Stephane Ouellette
