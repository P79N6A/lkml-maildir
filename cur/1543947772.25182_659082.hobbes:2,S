Do you actually know whether removing that lock fixes the reported bug?
I agree, the lock should be removed for now.  But I'd sure like to get 
some feedback about what's going wrong.  It's starting to look as 
though we'd be a lot better off blocking device registration during 
sleep instead of failing it.
Shouldn't resume_device() and suspend_device() now acquire the device 
semaphore before calling the various methods?  That's the way they 
used to work.
