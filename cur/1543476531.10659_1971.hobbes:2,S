Please don't do this.

The above is horribly broken, and should be killed on sight.
"swap_address" _must_ be set before try_to_swap_out(), because otherwise
when try-to_swap_out() sleeps any other processes trying to free will
start from the wrong address - unfairly penalizing the process in
question, as the accessed bits have been cleared.
If the above help, it only does so because it is unfair - which _can_ help
simply because other processes run faster.
It looks like you tried to optimize away one add, at the expense of
getting the whole algorithm wrong.
