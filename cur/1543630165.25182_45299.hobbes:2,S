Will do.

ia64 uses 16k standard; you can choose up to 64k and get performance
gains.
The main limitation on performance on a modern architecture is the
limited TLB coverage of the large real address space --- large pages
give fewer TLB entries for the same coverage, which leads to better
performance.

I found the limitation --- it was in the block layer, not ext2.
There were bugs in the other FS that let me create files bigger than
the 2TB pagecache limit, even though when I tried to write them bad
things happened.
Updating that web page is on my TODO list for Monday...

Sure.  Discs and hardware raids don't need partitions either, providing the
size of the media is smaller than the filesystem-layout-imposed size limit. 
The reasons, as far as I'm concerned, for partitioning a disc are:
    -- convenience, to allow controlled sharing of discs
    -- to allow striping of swap space across multiple spindles (have
       a swap partition on each drive)
    -- to keep filesystem size below backup-medium size.
If you want to boot from a drive, it'd better have a volume header
that the firmware (e.g., the BIOS) understands, too.
