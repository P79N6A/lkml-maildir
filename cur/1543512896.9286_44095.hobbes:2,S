Having format converters and sample rate converters in the kernel is
scary.
Straight mixing is doable, but that means that every app accessing sound
has to be using the same format, likely the best the sound hardware can
support,
i.e. 48kHz 16bit 2channels for most current hardware. While this
may not necessarily break the OSS API, it will break many current
OSS apps. And yes, no mmap
