Fix top. Top really lies about % idle: it computes it as 100-(%'s of
processes it sees). That's WRONG. % idle should be get from % of idle
process. Then, 100-(sum) could be reported as % unknown. Yes, %unknown
happen: if gcc exits just before top runs, you have %'s for
non-existent process and top does not see that %'s. It currently adds
it to %idle which is wrong.
