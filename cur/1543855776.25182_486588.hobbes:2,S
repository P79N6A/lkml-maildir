yes, or something like that.  I think you may have a piece of eeprom
hardware that is either "slow" or slightly out of spec.  I wonder if
the hrt kernel makes udelay(4) much more like 4us than the regular
kernels.
can you try adding mdelay(100); in e100_eeprom_load before the for loop,
and then change the multiple udelay(4) to mdelay(1) in e100_eeprom_read

usually its because whatever is printing is printing too fast or too
much at a time.
