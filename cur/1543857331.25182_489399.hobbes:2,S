i rather agree with his reservations on that, since we'd be making the
allocator's job harder by requesting order 1 pages for all allocations
on x86_64 large I/O patterns.  but it reduces complexity instead of
increasing it ... can you produce some benchmarks not just for your
workload but for one that triggers the order 1 case?  biovec-(256)
transfers are more common than you seem to think, and if the allocator
can't do it, that forces the bio code to fall back to 2 x biovec-128,
which, as you indicated above, would show a real penalty.
