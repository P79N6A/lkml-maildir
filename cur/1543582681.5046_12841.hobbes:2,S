You didn't give the (likely more) important part of your .config, but I'll bet
that you have CONFIG_APM_ALLOW_INTS disabled. Turn it on, rebuild and reboot.
At least on a Thinkpad T20, trying to use UDMA, and APM without APM_ALLOW_INTS
enabled gives an 'hda: lost interrupt'. Even worse, I didn't hang, but was able
to go on and trash my hard drive :-(
With CONFIG_APM_ALLOW_INTS turned on, everything behaves nicely.
