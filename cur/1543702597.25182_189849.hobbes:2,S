I verified that this bug has appeared in 2.6.1.
Having updated from .0 to .1 i lost my "#" key. My keyboard is a German USB 
Keyboard (Logitech Cordless).
This bug has been reported on the gentoo forums as well!
Switching back to 2.6.0 fixed the problem => 2.6.0 doesnt have this bug!
Greetings,
Florian
