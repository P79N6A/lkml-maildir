When reiserfs_get_block is called on the packed data (with create == 1), we
unpack it to a full block, so the generic functions can handle
dirties/writes from then on.  If the data in the page cache isn't up to
date, we need to copy the packed data into the page cache so it doesn't get
lost in the conversion.
This isn't for writing directly to the tail, I'm only doing that in
writepage, where I always overwrite the tail data with page data.
