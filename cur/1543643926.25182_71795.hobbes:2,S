From looking at the datasheet of the AMCC S5935, it appears to not be
compliant with the PICMG 2.1 cPCI hotswap specification.  That means
that it will probably take quite a bit of hardware and software hacking
to make insertion work.  My patches should provide a bit of basis for
further hacking if you do want to try and build something yourself, but
if reliable hotplugging is important to your project, I'd suggest
considering a switch to a PCI controller or bridge that is PICMG 2.1
hotswap compliant.
