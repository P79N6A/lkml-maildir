As others have said, you can't.  Unix in general doesn't work this way.
However, all is not lost.  There are other ways to accomplish what you want.

Actually, you want to have the program open a MIDI device, and read MIDI 
from there, then output to an audio device.  ALSA already has the 
facilities to do this, and it should not be hard to write a MIDI 
cross-queue device for OSS if you need that.  For low latency, you're going 
to have to be very careful about the structure of the main loop of this 
thing, and probably use mmap-ed audio under ALSA, or the low-latency DMA 
tricks with OSS.

Since there are several softsynths done already, why not look at how they 
did it.
http://www.xdt.com/ar/linux-snd/
 is a very big list of linux sound apps. 
There should be examples amongst them.
