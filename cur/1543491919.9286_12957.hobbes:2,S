I have to grumble about things like this because there are many of us who
don't use RedHat and wouldn't know what RPM is or even *WANT* to use it!
Furthermore, essential files that are meant to be part of Linux shouldn't
be distributed in a format proprietary to RedHat. It's fine if they use
RPM on their distributions but DO NOT LOCK the rest of us OUT! I have a
number of bitches about RedHat too but this isn't the place or the time
for these (take it to slashdot =)

Nope, 1.70 is still broken it will not compile on 2.2.5 with glibc-2.1 due
to a number of definitions being used (such as MNTOPT_NOQUOTA etc).
