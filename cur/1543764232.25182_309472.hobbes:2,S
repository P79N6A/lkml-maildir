I hope that this selection will replace the current DISCONTIGMEM prompts
in the individual architectures.  That way, you won't get a net increase
in the number of prompts.  However, I do realize that architectures
without DISCONTIG see a new, relatively useless menu/prompt.
Is there a way to hide an entire "choice" menu?  If there is, we can
certainly hide it when there's only one possible choice.
