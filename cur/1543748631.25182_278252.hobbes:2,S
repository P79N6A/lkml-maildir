All 2.6 kernels work with 64bit and >4GB memory, on my configurations 
(x86-64, ia64, and alpha).
It is a mistake to assume that all 64bit and/or >4GB is broken.

Ok, we finally get a bit of useful information.
Are you CERTAIN that you are booting a 64bit kernel?
Is your memory PC1600, PC2100, or PC2700?
Is your memory installed in matched pairs?
Is all your memory ECC registered?
Is your BIOS at the latest version?
Once we get through the hardware issues, now it is time to do a binary 
search of 2.6 kernels, to see which one works for you.  If no 2.6 
kernels work for you, then give 2.4 kernels a try.
