This is getting scary.  Manfred, Christoph, Pekka: have you guys taken a
close look at what's going on in here?

It's common for the kernel to use non-atomic ops for stats such as this
(networking especially).  We accept the small potential for small
inaccuracy as an acceptable tradeoff for improved performance.
But given that a) these stats are only enabled with CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB and
b) CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB causes performance to suck the big one anyway and c)
the slab.c stats are wrapped in handy macros, yes, I guess it wouldn't hurt
to make these guys atomic_t.  Sometime.  My slab.c is looking rather
overpatched again at present.
A problem right now is the -mm-only slab debug patches
(slab-leak-detector.patch, slab-cache-shrinker-statistics.patch and the
currently-dropped
periodically-scan-redzone-entries-and-slab-control-structures.patch).  It
would be good if we could finish these things off and get them into mainline
so things get a bit sane again.
