Nearly all flashcard devices (CompactFlash, SD, MMC, ..)
have built-in wear-leveling in the on-card controller logic.
So continuously rewriting the FAT will NOT rewrite the same
on-card physical pages over and over, but rather it will
try to spread those writes out over the entire (available)
span of physical sectors on the device.
So no worries about "wearing out the FAT sectors",
but I'd still use "async" just to reduce the overall
wear and tear regardless.
