We can get the invalidate_range to always be called without spinlocks if 
we deal with the case of the inode_mmap_lock being held in truncate case.
If you always want to be able to sleep then we could drop the 
invalidate_page() that is called while pte locks held and require the use 
of a device driver rmap?

You missed KVM. We did the best we could being as least invasive as 
possible.

You do not see a chance of this being okay if we adopt the two measures 
that I mentioned above?
