Hi Marcelo,
i will send you the boot messages from both kernels today as soon as 
possible. I think we have some serial consoles here so that it should 
be possible to give you the information about the card detection.
Should i send you the config files via email (also to the list?) or 
should i put them on a server so you can download them? I dont know 
which way you prefer. And yes, we are using ACPI.
So far,
Jason Brian Friedrich
