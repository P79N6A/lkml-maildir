XFS itself does not implement ACLs, it just provides storage for them
in extended attributes, and calls out to a security component which
does the acl checking. ACL inheritence would be a function of a security
subsystem too, although if it was implemented by copying the acl onto
a newly created file, and it has to be done atomically so that after a
crash you get the file with the acl, or no file, then the filesystem has
to do work.
