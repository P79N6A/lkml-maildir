Random keyboards, even connection to EHCI/OHCI seemed to make difference. 
We have been doing some experiments with Alan during OLS and it seemed 
quite hopeless.
A few keyboards we have been testing with seemed to be losing keypressess 
when coming out of suspend (if and only if the root hub wasn't suspended 
too, etc. Magic).
