?? I doesn't seem very different from the current (2.4t7)
static void generic_unplug_device(void *data){
        request_queue_t *q = (request_queue_t *) data;
        unsigned long flags;
        spin_lock_irqsave(&io_request_lock, flags);
        __generic_unplug_device(q);
        spin_unlock_irqrestore(&io_request_lock, flags);
}
...but perhaps I'm blind. Sometimes it happens after 6 hours of windows :(((
Bye.
