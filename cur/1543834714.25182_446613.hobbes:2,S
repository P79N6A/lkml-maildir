There is a simple solution against loops: No directory may contain a directory
with a lower inode number.
Off cause this would interfere with normal operations, so you'll allocate all
normal inodes above e.g. 0x800000 and don't test between those inodes.
If you want to hardlink, you'll use a different (privileged) mkdir call
that will allocate a choosen low inode number. This is also required for
the parents of the hardlinked directories.
You can also use the generic solution: Allow root to shoot his feet, and
make sure the gun works correctly.
