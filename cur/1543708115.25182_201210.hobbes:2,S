What I would actually code, in this case, and as I just noted a minute
ago in a parallel rely, would be:
  #!/bin/sh
  awk --posix -f '
    ...
  '
I basically never put awk in the shebang line.  Rather I invoke it on
quoted scripts inside of a shell script.  This habit has served me well
for some 25 years now, on a variety of systems.
