Think about a case where the inactive list if _full_ of mapped pages.
(which can easily happen, because one fault (do_swap_page) will _not_ move
the page to the active list directly --- it has to be accessed (Referenced
bit) twice (mark_page_accessed)).
We _think_ we don't have a shortage, so we won't call refill_inactive().
We keep calling swap_out(), which will not deactivate pages which _can_ be
written out, until we deactivate the pte's from the pages which are on the
inactive list.
Nothing prevents that, right ?
