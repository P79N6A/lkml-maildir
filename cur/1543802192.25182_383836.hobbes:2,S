See, I don't think that's a trick, isn't it just a form of demand
paging?  It seems silly to make the user wait to see the visible icons
until it's done rendering the hidden stuff.  Otherwise navigating the
file system speeds up and slows down based on how many files are in each
directory, even if the number of visible icons remains constant.
Do most Linux GUI apps really render everything without regard to what's
obscured and what's visible?
