Andrew, please hold on this patch, it hasn't been properly discussed
with the relevant maintainer, that is Paul Mackerras.
I can see matter for debate in there, like the whole duplication of the
fast exception return path...
It's also touching quite sensitive bits of kernel code (head.S) that
needs careful auditing and testing before beeing pushed upstream.
Ben.
