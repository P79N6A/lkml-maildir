If you can think of another way to fix the bug, I'm open to it.

Nothing ... it predates your patch ... it's not much use, but just in
case someone wants to get at the boot cpu gdt descriptors.

I don't think so, how? ... APM alters the GDT for the APM bios long
after cpu_init() is called, as does drivers/pnp/pnpbios.

Not without repeating your bug.  In the original code the gdt runs in
the boot area until cpu_init() where it switches to the original per_cpu
for the descriptor.  Your patch moved the boot CPU to using the boot
area after cpu_init(), which means subsequent boot cpu gdt changes alter
that area before the secondaries have come up (also using it).
If we have to move to individual pages for descriptors, then every CPU
needs one.

Since the allocation is in cpu_init(), it will be called on hotplug as
well.
