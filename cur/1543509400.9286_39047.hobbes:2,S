To add more information on my posting on the subject from yesterday.
Alpha-specific differences between kernel 2.2.11, for which em86
emulator works, and 2.2.12 where em86 is broken consist basically
from two sets - "core_mcpcia/setup" and changes to "math-emu"
support.  Backing out the first set provides ends up with a kernel
which is unbootable for some reasons so I tried to revert only
"math-emu" mods.  To my surprise with 2.2.12 kernel and 2.2.13pre7,
where a contents of arch/alpha/math-emu/ is replaced with
what was in 2.2.11, em86 - or at least Netscape on an emulator -
works just fine.
Anybody can shed a light on reasons?  This is quite important issue
to a number of people.
