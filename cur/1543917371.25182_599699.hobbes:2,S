I copied in a 2.6.22 kernel to see that it really did work, and it did.
But here's the crazy part - I did a dmesg, and it looks like it
*is* using e820 data, and it looks complete (I see the entire map - 
including the ACPI and reserved blocks way up high).
So apparently it was the 2.6.22 code that was buggy, but reading it,
I don't immediately see how.
