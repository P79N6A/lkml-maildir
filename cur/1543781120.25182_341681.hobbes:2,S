These drivers need to stop including asm/serial.h.  The only driver
which should include this file is drivers/serial/8250.c and no other.
It contains architecture specific definitions of the platforms 8250
ports.
It does not contain the default base baud (aka BASE_BAUD) for use with
a custom 8250 board, which is actually architecture independent.
