Various suggestions (e.g., booting with "acpi=off") have either not helped
or have resulted in a system which won't boot.
Today I replaced the ASUS A8N (nVidia nForce 4 chipset) mainboard and
AMD Athlon 64 CPU with a Intel DP965LT (Intel 965 chipset) and E6600
Duo Core 2 CPU. The SATA disks and cables are unchanged. The case, power
supply, and video card are also unchanged. Not one of the previous tests
now results in corruption. 
If anyone (e.g., a nVidia employee) wants to pursue this and can provide
a meaningful action plan I'll be happy to install the problem components
in another case and attempt to gather additional diagnostic data.
