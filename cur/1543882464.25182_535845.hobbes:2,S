So we might do writeback on one page in N - how do we
make sure none of the other pages are reclaimed while we are doing
writeback on this bclok?
IOWs, we have to lock every page in the block, mark them all as
writeback, etc. Instead of doing something once, we have
to repeat it for every block in page. This is better than a compound
page, how?

And the locking order? How do you enforce *kernel wide* the
same locking order for all pages in the same block so that we
don't get ABBA deadlocks on page locks within a block?

So you're suggesting that we reintroduce a buffer-oriented filesystem
interface to support large block sizes?

So you'll take slow, inefficient and complex rather than use an
non-intrusive and /optional/ interface to large pages?
Words fail me......
