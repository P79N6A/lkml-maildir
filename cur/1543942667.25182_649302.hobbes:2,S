To make that oops even remotely useful, you do need at least 
CONFIG_DEBUG_BUGVERBOSE enabled, and really preferably also 
CONFIG_KALLSYMS.
Otherwise there is no symbolic debug info, and it's impossible to even 
really guess what is going on.
It seems to happen early on module load (which is good, that makes it 
likely easier to debug), but without knowing the function and call chain, 
it's a bit useless.
