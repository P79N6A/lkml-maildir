Compiling it right now.
I'm sure it fixes the problem, but I don't feel like we should revert
it. I can't
be sure it won't cause any other problems, and anyway, this does not look
right a solution. Any other driver (rightfully) requiring the SSB_HOST would
then also break the bcm43xx driver.
I'll send an simplified patch in a few minutes.
