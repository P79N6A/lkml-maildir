Was -dyntick3 by the time I got there.
The user/system/idle/wait numbers now look sane, with one caveat:
static const ktime_t nsec_per_hz = { .tv64 = NSEC_PER_SEC / HZ };
...
                if (unlikely(delta.tv64 >= nsec_per_hz.tv64)) {
                        s64 incr = ktime_to_ns(nsec_per_hz);
                        ticks = ktime_divns(delta, incr);
Even though I have CONFIG_HZ=1000, this ends up generating a synthetic
count that works out to 100 per second.  gkrellm and vmstat are happy with
that state of affairs, but I'm not sure why it came out to 100/sec rather
than 1000/sec.

Also, it still disagrees with speedstep - it isn't noticing the TSC has
gone slow and drop back to the PM timer.
All in all, we're making progress. ;)
