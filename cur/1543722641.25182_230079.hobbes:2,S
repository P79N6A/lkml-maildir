Thank you.  :)
For those who tuned in late, this patch is a superset of a patch I had to make to
get some LSM work of mine to play nice with SELinux (my original request to the
SELinux crew included 2 other hooks which I since retracted, having found other
solutions).
It also addresses at least some of the things that Serge Hallyn was looking at
doing with some other LSM work, and also cleans up some issues for yet a third
thing that Serge and I were semi-collaborating on (no Serge, I hadn't forgotten
about that, I was sort of dragging my feet waiting for this patch to show up
and make my life a lot simpler.. ;)
