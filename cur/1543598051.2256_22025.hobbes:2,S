There is a simpler way to do this.  All tasks belong to a thread group, and 
while thread groups are connected via a different clone flag 
(CLONE_THREAD), in practice CLONE_THREAD and CLONE_VM are generally used 
together.  It would be trivial to add TGID to the information in /proc, 
then assume all tasks with the same TGID have the same VM as well.  It 
would be just one more line in the /proc output and not require any 
additional overhead.
