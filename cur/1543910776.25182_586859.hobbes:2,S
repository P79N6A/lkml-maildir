How many kernel developers use such old gcc versions?
And how many people notice the valid modpost warnings that can indicate
a runtime Oops?

The example [2] from my email is guaranteed to not be a problem with 
unit-at-a-time (as long as unit-at-a-time implies 
inline-functions-called-once - and that's although theoretically 
possible quite unlikely to change in practice).
This example is for a bug that should be fixed, but my point is the
maintainability, IOW: issues with older compilers might not be 
discovered and fixed before they go into a stable kernel.
We currently support 6 different stable gcc release series plus heavily 
modified vendor branches like 3.3-hammer. We can discuss whether it is 
now already the right time, and where to make the cut, but medium-term 
we must reduce the number of supported compilers.
