No, it's the other way around, unless DMA_COMPL_SKIP_*_UNMAP is set.
But I think the dw_dmac driver wrongly maps the buffers before queuing
them.

Yes, perhaps. Or we could just forcibly set those flags in
prep_slave_sg().

Yes, it is indeed a bit pointless to keep the total length around for
scatterlists.

No, that does indeed look unsafe. We should probably take dwc->lock and
disable bh around the call to dwc_scan_descriptors().

Yes, I think you're right. lli.llp of the last queued entry should be
updated when adding new entries to the queue.

Right.

Since dwc_scan_descriptors() was just called, all descriptors that were
completed successfully have been removed from the active list. So the
first entry must be the broken one.
