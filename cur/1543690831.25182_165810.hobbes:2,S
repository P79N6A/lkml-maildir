I don't see it vanishing either - people abuse IDE (especially SATA) for
weird stuff like high end scanners which want to use ide-scsi for sg. I
agree with Bart about ide-scsi for disks. For tape ide-tape isnt good
enough for newer stuff but that could be fixed either way

ATA drives don't generally talk ATAPI as well so you have protocol
stuff. For Serial ATA that is what the current SATA code everyone is
using does and each SATA vendor has followed the same path because our
existing PATA code 
In 2.7 the SCSI layer split can get finished so it seperates "scsi the
protocol" from "queueing engine and handling for an intelligent
controller".
Right now its not too bad - error handling is entirely pluggable for
example.
