I'm going to have the PCI root bridge driver bind to a device on the
primary side of the bridge.  The device could be enumerated by ACPI or
created manually when the bridge is detected.  It will not, however, be
a PCI device.

I think this would make a lot of sense.  ACPI could be used to enumerate
child devices for this bridge.  I'd like to begin work on a generic ISA
bus driver soon.

Yes, the macro is used when matching against only a class of device.

It would be possible, but probably not a clean solution.  Ideally we
want one driver to bind to the graphics controller and remain bound.  It
will then create class devices for each graphics subsystem, such as
framebuffer.  Much work remains to be done before this can happen.
