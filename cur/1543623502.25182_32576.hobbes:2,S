I looked at the code again and tried to trace TCP xmit path. Seems like it 
should not
back off because it does check return status of the dev_queue_xmit (send 
packet to the driver).
But it does not seem to retry either. Looks like it's just waits for an ack 
from the other side which
effectively makes your window equal to 1 segment. In any case small PPP 
queue won't make any
good for you.

I was under assumption that you know for sure that buffering is bad for you :)

All this depends on what you want to achieve. If you're looking for max TCP
performance. I'd recommend to use tcptrace and see what actually is going on.
May be your RTT is to high and you need bigger windows or may be there is
something else.
