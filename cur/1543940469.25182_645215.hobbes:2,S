The recommended way to silence warnings is to use annotation.
Use __ref for functions that may reference any __*init and __*exit
code/data.
Use __refdata for variables, and __refconst for const varibales.
Examples:
static int __ref foo(int bar)
{
	if (use_an_init_var)
		call_an_init_function();
}
The __ref annotation will place the code of the function in a section
named .ref.text and modpost will not check relocation records from
.ref.text to anything.
Likewise for variables:
int my_init_ref_variable[] __refdata = { ...};
But that said I took a closer look at the last warning.
We have pci_do_scan_bus() which is annotated __devinit.
It is a 4 line function that calls pci_scan_child_bus() which
is not annotated and calls pci_bus_add_devices() which
is not annotated.
pci_do_scan_bus() has sole users in drivers/pci/hotplug
and none of the users in drivers/pci/hotplug looks like
functions used during init time.
So it really looks like the __devinit annotation
in this case has been used to say that this is
code that is only relevant for hotplug use.
But the code is NOT restricted to be used in
the init phase and thus the __devinit annotation is *WRONG*.
The right fix is to restrict the code to be used
solely when HOTPLUG is enabled and no annotation can
help us here.
I would suggest the following fix.
Now it is obvious that this is HOTPLUG only code
and no false annotation that this is only used
in the init phase but the init code needs
to be preserved in the hotplug case.
So exactly the same issue as I previously described for
the __cpuinit misuse.
PS. I sneaked in a delete of a forward declaration. That
fix should maybe be factored out.
