Subject: MMC/SD: Write operation in invalid states by borken cards.

 Hi, 
 If a write operation fails, shouldnt we still check for the card 
 state to be 'ready to accept next data'?
 This question is because I have noticed that some (broken) cards 
 fail the write command, and the immediately issued subsequent 
 commands also fail since the card state was never checked before 
 sending these commands.
 (There was a discussion about these cards at the thread: "MMC: 
 CRC Errors with 2GB cards)
