3114 should not be affected by this problem (see below).
Most likely we are led down this road because the 'slow_down' module 
parameter has an excellent capacity for hiding all manner of problems.
As a tangent from this thread, this is why I was OK with adding the 
libata.dma even for SATA.  Sometimes knobs are found useful by users, 
though perhaps not its original intended use.  Sometimes masking a 
hardware problem can help you get through the rest of your day on hold 
with vendor support :)

The SIL_FLAG_MOD15WRITE flag is set in sil_port_info[] is set according 
to the best info we have from SiI, which indicates that 3114 and 3512 do 
not have the same problem as the 3112.
