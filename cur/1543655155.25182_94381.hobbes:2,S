From at least (IIRC) 2.5.46 on I'm getting wrong free block counts in inodes 
if I'm writing to discs. Looks like it must be a bit more than just 2 or 20 
files, a kernel compile is enough in most cases. It's happening on 2 
different hosts, one with SCSI, the other one with IDE. Nothing really bad 
has happend until today. But if I can't create new files on a filesystem with 
2 GB of free space I know it's time for an "e2fsck -f" on it.
