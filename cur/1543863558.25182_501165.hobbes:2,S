So for a server system, the following options should be as follows:
Preemption Model (No Forced Preemption (Server))  --->
[ ] Preempt The Big Kernel Lock
Also, my mobo has HPET timer support in the BIOS, is there any reason to 
use this on a server? I do run X on it via the Intel 965 chipset video.
So bottom line is make sure not to use preemption on servers or else you 
will get weird spinlock/deadlocks on RAID devices--GOOD To know!
Thanks!
Justin.
