Hey, even more impressive is "git pull --all", which will happily try to 
create an octopus of every single ref available at the other end.
Now, I think that octopus merges in _general_ are likely to be driver 
error, and that it might make sense to have a separate flag to enable 
them in the first place. That would solve the confusion..
So then you could do
	git pull --all --octopus xyzzy
if you _really_ meant to do that.
