But something's strange. If people were using 2.4, this hardware has
never worked for them, right ? Why suddenly would they decide that
they have to switch OS or hardware ? Or maybe this hardware replaces
an old one which was supported ?

Perhaps, but if you were the last, interest is pretty limited :-)

That's what I've seen. I can propose you something (unless someone
else raises his hand saying "no") : you update your patch with a
short description of what the hardware module is supposed to be used
for, and you accept to step up as the maintainer for this backport,
which will imply that you put your name and mail in the MAINTAINERS
file. That way, if you're the only user, nobody will be annoyed, and
if there are other users and some of them have problems, I don't waste
my time on something I don't know at all. If you agree with this deal
(which I think is fair), then I'm willing to merge your patch into
2.4.36-pre.
> Also IMHO the more drivers are in the tree the more users will use it.
Not necessarily. 2.4 is currently used by people who already are in 2.4
and cannot/do not want to switch, and by people who are looking for close
to zero maintenance. Drivers are often a reason to switch away from 2.4,
but not to stay in 2.4.

I don't believe that. Enterprise kernels will not evolve much and will
probably not enable it as long as they have not tested it.
