Hmm... It seems risky to increase the default readahead size.
I would appreciate a feed back when you are settled with some new
size, thanks.
btw, maybe you will be interested in the 'laptop mode'.
It prolongs battery life by making disk activity "bursty":

I have never did 'cp' tests, because it involves writes caching
problems. Which makes the result hard to interpret. However I will
try to explain the two tests.

- only size matters in this trivial case.
- the increased size generally do not help single reading speed.
- but it helped reducing overhead(i.e. decreased user/sys time)
- not sure why real time increased so much.

- the small files optimization in the new logic helped a little
Thanks,
