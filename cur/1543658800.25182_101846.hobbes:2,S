With smp_call_function() I execute code on exactly those CPUs the kernel
knows about. If the physical processors support HT but the kernel can't
run on the non-#0 logical CPUs (UP kernel or "noht"), then smp_call_function()
won't reach those logical CPUs #1 and everything's fine: my test will say
"not HT" which is exactly what I want in this case.
The point about checking the "local APIC physical ID" in CPUID 1, EBX,
instead of the field in the local APIC is _exactly_ because the CPUID
data is assigned by HW and read-only, while the local APIC field can be
changed. I don't want to depend on possibly-broken MP or ACPI tables or
have to know about the kernel's physical <--> virtual CPU # mapping de jour.

The sibling table tells you whether two linux-numbered CPUs are siblings,
but it doesn't tell which one is logical CPU #0 and which one is #1.
That distinction is important in some cases.
