Anybody know if fast etherchannel support is available for Linux? This is
the Cisco protocol where two to four ethernet interfaces can be bound
together as one logical high-speed interface.
In particular, I am looking for said support for dual Intel eepro 10/100
cards.
Any projects in prograss at this point?
