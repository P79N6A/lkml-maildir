I've been thinking about this a bit more...
Kconfig knows about the following types:
  o bool
  o tristate
  o string
  o hex
  o int
However, from a semantical point of view, they can be subdivided in 2 classes:
  1. driver/subsystem/library enablers (i.e. things that are used in a Makefile
     to decide whether to compile a unit or not):
       o tristate (y=builtin, m=loadable, n=disabled)
       o bool (y=builtin, n=disabled)
  2. options (i.e. things that control some features, limits, or default
     values):
       o bool (y=true, n=false)
       o string (literal)
       o hex (literal)
       o int (literal)
The confusion arises from the 2 different semantics for `bool': for the former,
a `depends on' obviously cannot be `builtin' if the dependency is `modular',
while for the latter, it can be `true' if the dependency is `modular'.
It would be nice if Kconfig would make the distinction between the two types of
`bool' explicit.  Anyone with a good replacement name for the first type of
`bool'? I can't find one.
