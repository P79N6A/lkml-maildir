Eh?  I _like_ CLONE_DETACHED, and I want notification cheaper, not
more expensive.
You've said that pthread_exit() _always_ notifies a sibling thread using
a futex.
Well, can we please move the futex wakeup into the kernel?  That is all
I ask.  It will make pthread_exit() _faster_, and me happy because
all exits are notified.
