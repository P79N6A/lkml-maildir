I'm not touching that code except to send out possible patches for others 
to test and comment on. I have no test-cases, nor any real interest in it. 
So yeah, please send me a tested and thought-through patch.
It sounded like Karl actually had a test-case to trigger this, but maybe 
I'm confused (and it sounds a bit unlikely, since it should be hard to 
trigger.. Although maybe you can trigger it by doing a direct_IO write 
with the *source* being an mmap() of the file you're writing to, and 
depending on the write itself re-populating the destination in the page 
cache?)
Karl?
