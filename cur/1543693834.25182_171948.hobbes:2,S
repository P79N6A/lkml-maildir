Hallo Robert,
you could search the archives for "NFS Problem" and "STALE", you
will probably find my post near end of September. The short solution:
Use "no_subtree_check" in /etc/exports like this:
/home \
  tony.local.net(rw,sync,no_root_squash,no_subtree_check)
I think I have found a bug in the nfs server code that always
returns a failure on subtree checks. I described my findings in
a post to this list, but nobody answered.
