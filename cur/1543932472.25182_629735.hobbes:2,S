Hello!
We are running Debian with 2.6.22-2-686-bigmem on Dell Blade 1955 hardware
and get a Kernel Panic with oom + message that there are no processes
left to kill:

Anyone an idea, what's the cause for that? This error happened on two of
those machines,
What I can see in our analysis done with munin is that the number of
open inodes and inode table size decreased within some days from 40k
to next to zero. Munin uses
   awk '{print "used.value " $1-$2 "\nmax.value " $1}' < /proc/sys/fs/inode-nr
to log those value (happened on both machines).
Thanks for any hint and CC as usual, please.
Nico
