Why you say that?  clear_bit has built-in acq or rel semantic depends
on how you define it. I think only one of smp_mb__after/before need to
be smp_mb?

I would make that MODE_RELEASE for clear_bit, simply to match the
observation that clear_bit is usually used in unlock path and have
potential less surprises.

Please kill all volatile declaration, because for non-atomic version,
you don't need to do any memory ordering, but compiler automatically
adds memory order because of volatile.  It's safe to kill them because
cmpxchg later has explicit mode in there.
Same thing goes to all other bit ops.
