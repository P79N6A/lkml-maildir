   maybe my previous posting got lost somehow (didn't receive any reponse).
   There is a bug in ip_output.c:ip_queue_xmit().
It didn't get lost, I've applied your patch.
   BTW: Is there any reason why the setting of the new skb's ownership is not
   done within skb_realloc_headroom() itself?
Every time we've added an implicit side effect to a generic SKB
routines, it has lead to problems and hard to track down bugs.  And it
is probably someone will find a situation where they _do not_ want to
set the new skb's ownership.
