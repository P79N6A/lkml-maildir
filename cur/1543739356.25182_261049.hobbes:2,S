I'm writing an application to run on a PowerPC with a 2.4 embedded
Linux kernel, and I want to make device registers for our custom
hardware accessable from user space with mmap().  The physical address
of the device is above the 4gb boundary (we attach to the 440's
external peripheral bus), so a standard 'remap_page_range()' call
won't work.
I've come up with a solution that appears to work, but never having
worked with the page tables before, I'm a bit nervous.  So if anyone
would give the following code a short "code review", I'd greatly
appreciate it.  I'm assuming that the page table entries created here
will be removed when a process exits as part of the normal cleanup.
The physical address passed to 'mk_pte_phys' has a value like
0x150000000ULL.  Our device has only 0x100 bytes of addresses, so a
single page table entry is enough (pages are 0x1000 long), and we'll
only make one mmap() call per device.
TNA!!
