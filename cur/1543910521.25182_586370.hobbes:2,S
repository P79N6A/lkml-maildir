Ok, that would mean that sched_clock can just return the virtual cpu
time and the two hooks starts and stops the idle periods as far as the
scheduler is concerned. In this case we can use the patch from Jan with
the new implementation for sched_clock and add the two hooks to the
places where the cpu-idle notifiers are done (do_monitor_call and
default_idle). In fact this could be an idle-notifier. Hmm, I take a
closer look tomorrow when I'm back at the office.

How you think about an idle cpu depends on your viewpoint. The source
for the virtual cpu time on s390 is the cpu timer. This timer is stopped
when a virtual cpu looses the physical cpu, so it seems natural to me to
think that real=steal, virtual=0 because the cpu timer is stopped while
the cpu is idle. The other way of thinking about it is as valid though.

That would be good.
