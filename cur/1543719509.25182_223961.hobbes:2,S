Keep in mind that the kernel keys we're talking about are keycodes, not
keysyms, and thus are not a result of a keymap. On the other hand, the
xkb tables you've shown are for keysyms.
The equivalences are:
Kernel		   XKB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
KEY_LEFTALT    ==  key <LALT> 
KEY_RIGHTALT   ==  key <RALT> 
KEY_LEFTMETA   ==  key <LWIN> 
KEY_RIGHTMETA  ==  key <RWIN> 
KEY_COMPOSE    ==  key <MENU> 
There is a 1:1 mapping. 
Now, if you want to make them _do_ the same both in X and on console,
then we're talking keymaps, and there I think is no problem again,
because the kernel can handle up to 9 modifiers as far as I know,
although they don't all have names.
linux/keyboard.h:#define NR_SHIFT       9
