Hmm, keyboard (Cherry G80-3000 LPCDE-2) and mouse (Logitech RX300) are 
connected via an equip KVM 2 port switch, but everything else is behaving 
properly, and no serial devices connected ATM. It only triggers the help 
messages, other sysrq messages are triggered at will (AFAIKS).
# grep "SysRq : HELP" /var/log/messages | wc -l
814
syslog starts at Jan 16, so you can imagine how disturbing this behavior is.
I cannot outrule some hardware defects. Will start to eliminate the KVM 
switch, but I thought, I ask here before since google also didn't revealed 
any hints..
Thanks,
