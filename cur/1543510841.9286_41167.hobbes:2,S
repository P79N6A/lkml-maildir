I have just tried a Pioneer DVD 114, an IDE/ATAPI drive, on my RH6.0 +
patches system (2.2.5 kernel).  It seems to work properly as a CDROM
(all I expected), but the boot log contains an anomaly.  Perhaps it is
important.
Here is an extract.  The interesting thing is on the second last line.
It says that the drive speed is 0X.  In fact, it is 10X (in whatever
way drive makesrs specify speed).
PIIX4: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 39

hdc: ATAPI 0X DVD-ROM drive, 512kB Cache
Uniform CDROM driver Revision: 2.54
A little examination of the code suggests that this message is being
produced by drivers/block/ide-cd.c:ide_cdrom_probe_capabilities
	printk ("%s: ATAPI %dX %s", 
        	drive->name, CDROM_CONFIG_FLAGS (drive)->max_speed,
		(CDROM_CONFIG_FLAGS (drive)->dvd) ? "DVD-ROM" : "CD-ROM");
Is this a bug or a feature?
Is it already known?
Is there a fix?
Actually, I don't need a fix since the drive is destined for a MSWin98
system.  But I thought that this might be worth reporting.
Thanks,
