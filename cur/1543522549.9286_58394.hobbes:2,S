Unfortunatelly on practice it's what many admins doing when ORBS probes their
machines for FIRST time. Just to pull itself out of ORBS blacklist (instead of
fixing MTA configuration - it's easier to block ORBS then to fix MTA). If they
got 50,000th probe then something REALLY wrong happened: usually ORBS doing
probes very seldom.

He has no easy way to find out (if system is blocking then bot can not check it).

Is system "relay normal mail" then it can be convinced to relay SPAM (I've not
seen MTA with AI to detect SPAM using mail contents).

Of course. That's why there are MAPS RBL, MAPS RSS, MAPS DUL and *ORBS*.
