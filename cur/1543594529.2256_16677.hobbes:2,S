Regarding to the discussion on the swap size,
Recently, Rick van Riel posted a message that there is a bug 
related to "reclaiming" the swap, and said that it is on his 
TODO list.
If I believe it, the current trouble we have regarding to the swap 
size is not because we do not have a sufficient size for the swap, 
but because there is a bug, although Linus advised us to assign
2 times the physical memory for the swap.
I don't know.
Anyway, I am trying to put an extra 4GB hard disk on an Alpha UP2000 right now.
Regards,
Hugh
