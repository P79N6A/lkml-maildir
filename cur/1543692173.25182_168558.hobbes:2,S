OK, thx, I'll take a look.

It's known only in the sense that I have it.  The process is accept 
submission from outside network (source code).  Compile it (in a security 
playbox) statically to produce a single binary.  Then run this, time it, 
verify correctness of outcoming data.  Send the results back out to the 
outside world.  Iterate for each submission - sometimes one every couple 
seconds other times one per hour (depends on the current data set etc).

This is for an information technology algorithmic programming contest -
currently being used on a single comp, but likely to be required (in
time...) by all such online contests (like the one funded by IBM/ACM)  
which might mean a few hundred maybe thousand worldwide.
