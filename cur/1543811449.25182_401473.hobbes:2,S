We seem to have a nasty bio slab leak.

Two seperate reports, both using raid1, sata_via and firewire
Curiously, they're both on x86-64 too.
Will keep an eye open for other reports of this as they come in.
(The kernels they mention in those reports are fairly recent.
 2.6.15-1.1977_FC5 is ctually based on 2.6.16rc4-git6)
