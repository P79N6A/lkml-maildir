So...
I queued up this version with a cc to stable under the assumption that this
is the patch which should be applied to 2.6.x.y, but this version is not
the one which will go into 2.6.25.
Correct?
If so: messy.  The stable guys might want to wait until they see the real
2.6.25 patch and perhaps prefer to backport that version.
