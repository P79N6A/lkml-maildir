hrm, i just ran your test progam. i don't hear this on my gus classic /
celeron 533 / 320mb ram.  at least nothing that *sounds* like crackling.
just a high pitched annoying noise.  using 2.4.1 + andrew morton's
lowlatency patches.  (which are wonderful, thanks andrew!)
jiggle the cable from the GUS to wherever it goes to.
