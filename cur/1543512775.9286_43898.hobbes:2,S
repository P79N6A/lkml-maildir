So, setting the program to a high RT priority, and then calibrating is
going to give the same results as when the OS tells the app that it
can take 50% of the CPU. 
Note that this won't work "fine". If there is nothing "realtime"
running, and I ask the OS: what percentage of the CPU do you have
available? I'm going to get the answer: "100%". If I then use (close
to) 100%, the X server for instance will be starved. Kind of useless
mpeg player then. So the developer decides that if the OS says 100%,
he will request 90%. Fine. Now someone else has a system where the X
server requires significantly more CPU horsepower to display the same
stream. Now what?
Conclusion: The "ask the OS for a guaranteed percentage of the CPU" 
sysstem isn't all that easy to use anyway....
