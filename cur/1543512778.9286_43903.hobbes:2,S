Hello!
Some time ago I posted that adding several printk()s to apm.c fixed my
freezing machine problem.
Since those frezes happened with and without APM enabled (in BIOS and
kernel) I do not think that the problem is really APM related. But what the
fix does is regular console output (about 5 to 10 messages per second). As
long as this fix works for me I am very pleased but feel not very satisfied
with it. It is just a way to circumvent the problem, not a real fix.
What I would be interested in is now:
  Several other users reported those freezes too.
  Are those still seeing the freezes with 2.2.13pre* kernels?
  Wold they dare to test my temparary APM fix in order to see if we are
    suffering the same problem?
Anyone interested please contact me by personal email and I send you a patch
and installation hints.
If the fix also works for them I will try to figure out where the problem
might be. Any help is absolutely welcome!
