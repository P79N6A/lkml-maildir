Actually you have it just backward. Let me try to explain how this works.
The programs which benefit from N:M are exactly those which don't behave
the way you describe. Think of programs using locking to access shared
memory, or other fast resources which don't require a visit to the kernel.
It would seem that the switch could be done much faster without the
transition into and out of the kernel.
Looking for data before forming an opinion has always seemed to be
reasonable, and the way design decisions are usually made in Linux, based
on the performance of actual code. The benchmark numbers reports are
encouraging, but actual production loads may not show the huge improvement
seen in the benchmarks. And I don't think anyone is implying that they
will.
Given how small the overhead of threading is on a typical i/o bound
application such as you mentioned, I'm not sure the improvement will be
above the noise. The major improvement from NGPT is not performance in
many cases, but elimination of unexpected application behaviour.
When someone responds to a technical question with an attack on the
question instead of a technical response I always wonder why. In this case
other people have provided technical feedback and I'm sure we will see
some actual application numbers in a short time. I have an IPC benchmark
I'd like to try if I could get any of my test servers to boot a recent
kernel :-(
