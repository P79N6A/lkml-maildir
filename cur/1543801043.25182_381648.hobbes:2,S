The issue I hit was we have a 'latest stable kernel release 2.6.14.5' and 
under it a 'the latest stable kernel' (or words to that effect) on 
kernel.org.
Then when 2.6.15 came out, that was it!  No patch for the 'latest stable 
kernel release 2.6.14.5'.  It was GONE!
OK, I suppose we are all capable of getting back to where we are on rebuilding 
to latest 'stable', but there _is_ a missing link for somebody that doesn't 
know - and I think backtracking patches isn't really the way to go if the 
'latest stable release' isn't catered for.
