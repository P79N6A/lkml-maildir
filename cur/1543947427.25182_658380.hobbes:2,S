This is the start of the stable review cycle for the 2.6.23.17 release.
There are 8 patches in this series, all will be posted as a response
to this one.  If anyone has any issues with these being applied, please
let us know.  If anyone is a maintainer of the proper subsystem, and
wants to add a Signed-off-by: line to the patch, please respond with it.
These patches are sent out with a number of different people on the
Cc: line.  If you wish to be a reviewer, please email stable@kernel.org
to add your name to the list.  If you want to be off the reviewer list,
also email us.
Responses should be made by Tuesday, Feb 25, 2008, 00:10:00 UTC.
Anything received after that time might be too late.
The whole patch series can be found in one patch at:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/stable-review/patch-2.6.23.17-rc1.gz
and the diffstat can be found below.
Note, this will probably be the last 2.6.23-stable release done by me,
barring any severe problems found.
thanks,
greg k-h
