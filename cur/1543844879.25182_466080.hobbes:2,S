Thank you for flaming. ;-) I thought the lines above would lead some 
people to read on and post an enlightening answer to the implicit question 
that followed, so I'll restate it below.

Ok, I'll try.
In the mean time, maybe someone can try to answer my original question, 
that was: is there a race between snd_pcm_oss_change_params() reallocating 
a buffer and resample_expand() using another (possibly the same)?
Now I hope that my mail client does not taint the question as well. ;-)
Cheers,
