Disassembling must be started "much" earlier. From your example one
could get the impression you want to get the instruction right before
EIP. It's not possible to go back this way. For example if you want to
disassemble 100 bytes before EIP you must start at EIP-100 and EIP-99
and ... and EIP-100-max_instruction_length+1. Then you have the right
one among them (well, 99.9% but let's don't be too pedantic).
You also can't stop the above max_instruction_length iteration when
the next instruction address matches EIP. You can have even
max_instruction_length matches. But from the additional info (code
after EIP, assembly "quality", available source where the crash
happend) you could choose the right one.
