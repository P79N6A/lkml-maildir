Hi,
Is there a way (in 2.2.8) to turn on journalling or synchronous writing
of metadata without turning on synchronous writing of the data.  What
are the pros/cons of doing this.  I have seen this discussed a long time
ago in an thread somewhere in which Linus was debating this with FreeBSD
folks but can't find that thread now.  It seems to me he said that Linux
supportted it but that it was turned off by default because it was "the
wrong thing to do".  To my mind, however, It could be good for a new
server in which the files in the news spool filesystem are numerous
small files, none of which are really all that critical individually. 
Thanks for any input.  fsck on large mail servers can be a real pain.
-Steve
