    If I mount a floppy image or an iso image trough loopback for example:
    mount boot.img t -o loop=/dev/loop0
    and then umount it with:
    umount t
    or:
    umount /dev/loop0
    The loopback module usage count stays 1 in /proc/modules
    also I cannot mount another image thorugh /dev/loop0 cause it's still in
    use acording to
    the kernel.
Note that a loopback mount is a two-stage thing: first
losetup to connect /dev/loop0 to some file, and then mount.
If you never mention any loop device explicitly, all will work well:
	mount boot.img /t -o loop
	umount /t
Here mount will take the `-o loop' option and invent a free loop device
for you, do the losetup and the mount. The umount will unmount the device
and free the loop device again.
You can also handle the losetup part yourself, perhaps to do things
other than mounting to this image. Freeing the loop device works with
	losetup -d /dev/loop0
Conclusion: If you say that `umount /dev/loop0' does not free the loop
device then I am happy because that is intended behaviour: if you handle
the loop devices explicitly, you are responsible for them and should
call losetup yourself.
On the other hand, if you say that `umount t' does not free the loop
device then something is wrong. I just checked, but here all is OK.
Maybe you were mistaken? I do not think this has ever been wrong.

[PS - I only talk about the `losetup -d' being done or not. Have not
checked module usage counts.]
