No, it won't be even probed.  Note that ide_probe_for_cmd640x() was detecting
both VLB and PCI chipsets.  After moving detection to generic IDE PCI layer,
only PCI version of the chipset will be probed (and only after Device/Vendor
ID matching).  You are of course free to disagree as much as you want...

Get serious, piece of mind after reading drivers/ide code?  Nah.

Minimize changes, then next time when you need to fix this driver (say in 2.7)
you will spend much less time on tracking changes 2.0.x->2.7.x.
