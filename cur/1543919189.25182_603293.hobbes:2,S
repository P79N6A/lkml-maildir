Are we sure that this is the only event that causes the conflicts between
the EHCI and it's companion virtual OHCI/UHCI host(s)?
Is there a chip reset done to the EHCI controller early during device
probe that could cause problems too?
I know it's grotty, but I definitely feel more comfortable with the
fix involving making sure EHCI loads and fully probes first.
