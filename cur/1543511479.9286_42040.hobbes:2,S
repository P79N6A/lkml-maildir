Alan, I completely understand this issue.  I'm not so ignorant ;-)
And attacks on the defragmentation process WAS NOT a reason to write the patch.

I suppose you haven't read all the detals.
The problem isn't related to 2.0.3x - it well applies to 2.3.18 kernel.
It's a rather fresh idea (I haven't heard about it before this August) about
TCP spoofing attack based exactly on predictable IP IDs.
