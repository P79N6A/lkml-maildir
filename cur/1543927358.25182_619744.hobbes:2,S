This was mentioned in one of my mails.  I added the parameter to
accommodate Linus's and Zack's idea to use the functionality for syslets
as well.  Not really a multiplexer, it is meant to be a "execute
synchronously or asynchronously" flag.  In the latter case an additional
parameter might be needed to indicate the notification mechanism.

Yep, sorry, I didn't update the text by including the most recent test
program.  I'll do that for the next version.
