Ok, I committed the patch as-is, since it's what Anders tested, but I'm 
not at all convinced that it is necessarily the best or final form. The 
things I am aware of but didn't think about all *that* deeply:
 - do we get return values etc right (ie if we complete the command that 
   didn't give any data, how do we account the size of it?)
 - what about that remaining old unexpected case? I kept the "wait for it 
   with timeout" behaviour for the case that wasn't an issue here, but if 
   it really is a shared interrupt, that seems like it's going to always 
   reset the timeout to WAIT_WORSTCASE, which doesn't sound really right.
so I think this particular bug is fixed and we should be better off, but 
I'm definitely not claiming that the code shouldn't have people thinking 
about improving it..
