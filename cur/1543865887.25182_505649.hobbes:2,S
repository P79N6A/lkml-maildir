Yes, that would be generic code, in the pure sense.

That would be generic code too, but by way of functional awareness. This is 
sometimes necessary, as no pure generic code has been found.
What's important is not the generic code, but rather the correct abstraction 
of the problem-domain, regardless of it's implementation, as that can be 
conveniently hidden behind the interface.

What we want is correct code, and usually that means less code in the long 
run.  
So, instead of allowing the implementation to dictate the system design, it 
may be advisable to concentrate on the design first, to achieve an abstract 
interface that is realized by an implementation second.
Thanks!
