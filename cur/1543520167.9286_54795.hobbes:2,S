I have no problem with you doing it now. Just don't expect the quick hack 
approach to make a mainstream kernel. 
So wouldn't it be more productive to get the kiovec to block device interface
working. You also btw do need to go via the ll_rw_block request queue at all
times. There is locking in that, there is request merging in that and there
is overlap handling in that.
If you queue a request when the driver knows the queue status or the plug
status you will change behaviours, and I doubt the ide layer will like it
