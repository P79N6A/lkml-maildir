Hello,
This patch is based on Linux 2.4.32, and I've verified the same problem
exists on 2.6.15.4.
Working on a machine with a 2.4.32 kernel, I was surprised to see the driver
complaining when setting the speed to 100FD using mii-tool, but accepting
the setting with ethtool.
Digging into the code, I found that there is some confusion with :
 - DUPLEX_FULL and FULL_DUPLEX,
 - DUPLEX_HALF and HALF_DUPLEX
in the code :
...
                           spddplx += (mii_reg & 0x100)
                                       ? FULL_DUPLEX :
                                       HALF_DUPLEX;
                           retval = e1000_set_spd_dplx(adapter,
                                                       spddplx);
...
and
int
e1000_set_spd_dplx(struct e1000_adapter *adapter, uint16_t spddplx)
{
        adapter->hw.autoneg = 0;
        switch(spddplx) {
        case SPEED_10 + DUPLEX_HALF:
                adapter->hw.forced_speed_duplex = e1000_10_half;
                break;
....
when the constants don't have the same value.
This patch is simply changing the code in the e1000_set_spd_dplx to use the
same constants as does the caller of the function : FULL_DUPLEX and
HALF_DUPLEX
whose values are not 0, to make sure we have had a successfull init
(DUPLEX_HALF value is 0, and the DUPLEX_xxx are defined in ethtool.h, thus
are probably not meant to be used in the mii interface).
