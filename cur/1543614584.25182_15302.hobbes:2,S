Nicholas,
Does the record work on your via82c686 sound? I have the same chip set
and I cannot get the record to work. Mixing and playing mp3's wav's etc
works ok. Mixing line-in/mic to line-out woeks fine.
Just cannot record.
I posted the probelm here and the only response I got was emails from a
couple of others with thee same propblem.
But, not one concerning fixing the problem. Or, if recording is even
implemented or not.
Using 2.4.16 kernel and via82cxxx_audio ver. 1.9.1
