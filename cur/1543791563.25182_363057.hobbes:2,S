Okay, if you say so.

I am saying, ideally all pages marked for DMA would be copied e.g. on fork
rather than COW-ed since hardware may be accessing them.
We dont want the overhead, so instead we let the application
avoid COW in another way with DONTCOPY, and assume the child is careful
not to access any data in this VMA (even part of the page that is
not DMA'ed from/to).
Fine, but if the number of such pages is small, it seems we can
afford a full copy, so lets let the user decide?
But whether we want to, or not, is IMO a separate question from DONTCOPY,
which we seem to need anyway.
