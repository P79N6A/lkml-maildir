OK, despite knowing nothing of the kernel internals, I looked at doing
this myself :-)
I notice that TASK_UNMAPPED_BASE is only used in get_unmapped_area() in
mm/mmap.c, which is encouraging.  Moreover, get_unmapped_area() is only
called once in mm/mmap.c and once in mm/mremap.c.  So I think I would only
have to change get_unmapped_area() to get the desired effect, and this
change should not affect anything else.
If no address is specified, get_unmapped_area() currently chooses the
first (large enough, unused) region above TASK_UNMAPPED_BASE.  I guess I
would just have to define something like TASK_UNMAPPED_CEILING and arrange
for get_unmapped_area() to allocate the first region below
TASK_UNMAPPED_CEILING.  And I guess TASK_UNMAPPED_CEILING should equal
TASK_SIZE - maximum stack size.  What is the maximum stack size?  I
couldn't quite figure this out myself.
Am I missing something, or should choosing an appropriate value for
TASK_UNMAPPED_CEILING and changing get_unmapped_area() be sufficient?
Cheers,
Wayne
