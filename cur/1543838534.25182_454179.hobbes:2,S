It does not matter, let's it be 100mb or any other number, since
allocation is separated and does not depend on main system one.
Network allocator can steal pages from main one, but it does not suffer
from SLAB OOM.
Btw, I have a system with 1gb of ram and 1.5gb of low-mem tcp limit and
3gb of high-mem tcp memory limit calculated automatically.
