Nothing I could name... I guess I'll just let you cooperate with
Rafael, he can translate ;-).
[Well, perhaps there's one thing. Have you seen Al Viro's mails? He
tends to use quite a strong language. I guess asking you to talk like

that my and his native languages have quite a lot in common. Perhaps
I'm doing poor job translating into English at higher level...]
