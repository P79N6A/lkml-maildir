Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/12/128

I forgot to put the seqence numbers in the patch subjects (I did
in the message ids).
Here is the order I diffed them:
sched domain sysctl: register online cpus
sched domain sysctl: free and rebuild when changing domains
sched.c: use kcalloc
sched domain sysctl: don't bug on alloc failure
sched domain sysctl: sysctl tables can have no holes
