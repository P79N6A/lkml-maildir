Hi Peter.
As I'm now joint maintainer of e2comp, there should be no problems
with my commenting on this...

If it does, then your problem isn't the one you've been describing in
this thread.
 > E2compr's not going to get in the kernel at this rate.
Why on earth not? I'm certainly hoping to see it in the mainstream
kernel before too much more time passes...

I don't see that as even approaching a valid reason.

Agreed.

Agreed.
Likewise, the e3fs that Stephen Tweedie is working on can either be
against e2fs as it currently stands or against a version thereof that
includes e2comp. That patch currently works independantly of e2fs and
that's the way it should be as the resulting patch is clearly going to
be at least partially incompatible with e2fs. However, there is no
such argument in favour of e2comp being a separate file system.

Can do, yes - but doing so would in my opinion be a bad idea, and for
that reason I have no intention of doing so.

I don't see it as even being necessary.

The solution is simple enough: As the various patches become stable
enough to be relied on, merge them into the standard kernel. Nothing
beyond that is necessary.
I don't by any means know all of the patches against the e2fs file
system, but of the ones I do know, only e2comp is even close to being
ready for inclusion in the standard kernel. However, it's long past
time that e2comp was included therein in my opinion.

Why is compression "the nasty word", as you put it? The equivalent is
certainly available for Windows 95 and Windows 98, as I use it on the
only system I run with Win95 on it. Look at 
http://www.zipmagic.com
 if
you don't believe me.

Whilst they are under development, that's the ONLY sane way to handle
them.

It already does.

Really? Please explain why.

It probably could. All it would require is for e2fsck to have a
configuration file stating which binary to call for each combination
of the various patches.
What would make far more sense in my opinion is to distribute as
standard a version of e2fsck that can already handle those of the
various patches that are regarded as reasonably stable. As far as I
can tell, there's no valid reason why this hasn't been done, and if
there is, I'd love to hear it.

Ted: What exactly do you mean by "the format filesystem" ???
If you are referring to "the format of the filesystem", then as far as
the e2comp patch is concerned, that is essentially unchanged, as the
ONLY change is that the file will take up less blocks than its
UNCOMPRESSED size indicates. Were this not the case, then it would not
have been possible to produce the patch in the first place.

To put it bluntly, if the e2comp patch is beta code, then so is the
entire Linux kernel. I for one don't believe the label "beta code" can
honestly be applied to either at this time.
 > The e2compr stuff is not beta code.
Very true.

It's certainly more stable than several of the file systems that have
been accepted into the kernel, and less controversial than some of
them appear to be.
 > The only thing it's not as stable as is ext2.
I can't say that I agree with that. Unless the comments Linus has been
making in the Linux-Kernel mailing list recently are rubbish, some of
the recent 2.3 series changes to memory management have made ext2 less
than stable, and several of the 2.3 series kernels are effectively
unusable as a result...
I will add that I have no direct experience of this as I don't run the
2.3 series kernels on my production machines and those comments had
been specifically directed by Linus at the 2.3 series kernels. I can
therefore only presume that he knew what he is talking about when he
made those comments.
 >> If it turns out that some change is needed to more efficienctly

Linus made it clear some time ago that ANY time a file system changed
in ways that meant that it could no longer access older formats, it
would be given a new name. That's the reason why ext became ext2 in
the first place, and also why ext3 has its own name. As a result, that
argument is a non-starter.
 >> Marketing and beta don't go together.....
Oh yes they do - I can easily name three products that have been
widely marketed successfully that are clearly all beta grade products:
 1. Windows 95
 2. Windows 98
 3. Windows NT.
However, say "Honest marketing and beta don't go together" and I would
gladly agree with you....

If MacroHard had any sense, they would have done just that some time
ago.

Better still, let's get it merged into e2fs where it belongs. That
way, we can do precicely what Linus has said he wants: Get it in wide
circulation so any problems can be located and ironed out.

The only place it belongs is inside of e2fs in the first place, with
the less stable patches being against the result, and not as it
currently stands.
