Well, I was reading some more of the drivers and I am also not sure if
such methods are needed in backlight core. Let's take atyfb_base.c -
it tries to manipulate backlight's power from atyfb_blank. But it is
normally called from fb_blank() which is then calls
fb_notifier_call_chain(FB_EVENT_BLANK, &event);
So on the end backlight device will get that event and will turn off
power anyway. Now, atyfb_blank is also called suring suspend/resume so
we probably should just add handling of FB_EVENT_SUSPEND and
FB_EVENT_RESUME to the backlight core.
