Hi, no problem.

I know. I had the same southbridge in my Abit KG7 but I don't know if you 
have version A or version B. I had version B and it has several disk 
problems fixed. For version A there are some workarounds in the kernel.

I don't think that there will be any oops or something like that. But 
maybe some IDE messages - like failed commands or something. But if there 
are no such messages then chance is that this is some memory/mb problem.

Yes, slowing down your graphics card could help.

So after burning reboot fast end check the BIOS measurements. Temperatures 
will not change that much in minute or two. If your system is overheating 
they will be high for at least 5 minutes after reboot.

Hmm... What did you change before the system started not working? Maybe 
try with only 256MB module installed if that was the working 
configuration...

Yeah, I am waiting for stable and better x86_64 too. But I replaced my KG7 
to KW7 in the mean time just to be sure I have something before I will 
buy x86_64. :-)

Yeah, it sucks. I live in Poland and we have really big prices for 
computer parts here. :-(

No problem.
