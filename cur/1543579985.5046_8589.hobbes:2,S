  freeamp is just that good.  I've seen 0% cpu usage with it on 2.4 and 2.2.   if you
notice closely, it does use  a percentage of cpu but it's so small that over the course of
time that the cpu usage of each process is averaged, it is closer to 0 than 1.  It is hands
down the best mp3 player i've seen out.
