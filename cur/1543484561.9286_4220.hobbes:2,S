I've never managed to get a 1505 or 151x card to work with IRQ11. Ever. 
I've had two or three cards, in five or six different machines, and I've 
always had to change the IRQ to something else (usually 10).
I had just assumed that it was a coincidence. Nonetheless, try changing the
IRQ, even if you have to move a conflicting device to IRQ 11 to make room for
it.
