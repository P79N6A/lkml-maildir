Subject: [patch 1/1] network: add the missing phy_device speed information to phy_mii_ioctl
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/3/2/241

Changelog:
Function `phy_mii_ioctl' returns physical device's information based on
user requests. When requested to return the basic mode control register
information (BMCR), the original implementation only returns the
physical device's duplex information and forgets to return speed
information, which should not be because BMCR register is used to hold
both duplex and speed information.
The patch checks the BMCR value against speed-related flags and fills
the return structure's speed field accordingly.
