Sounds good to me.  In Xen we have 1024 event channels which we need to
map down into a smaller irq.  Aside from the complexity of maintaining a
mapping table, that's not a huge issue for now, but when we start
exposing pci devices to guests it all becomes more complex.  The ideal
for us is to simply use event channel == irq, which this would allow.
