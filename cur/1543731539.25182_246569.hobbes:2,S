While I do think that there are some hacks in netatalk, the
hacks there are not nearly as bad as the hacks that made it
into the kernel to support exporting a native Mac filesystem.
Take a look at the fork code in the hfs filesystem from 2.4
or before for exporting to netatalk.  It's disgusting, and
mostly because there is no easy way to export the resource
fork and extra metadata that is essential to the client. The
2.6 code doesn't have that anymore, but I don't think it
actually works with netatalk either. Perhaps someone can
correct me on that, but I don't see how it could work.
I would hope that something comes out of this whole discussion
that will allow a much better interface between the hfs/hfsplus
code in the kernel and netatalk.
