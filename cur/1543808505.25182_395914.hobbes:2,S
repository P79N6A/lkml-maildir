Since the process has little or no control over that it seems 
impractical. And works the wrong way, when there is a ton of free memory 
the process would get a large rss and be killed, while on a loaded 
system it would run.

First, someone did some work on this a few years ago, you might be able 
to find info looking a rmap posts for the mid 2.4 days.
Second, I think this limitation needs to be enforced only when free 
memory is below some trigger point, when candidates for reclaim would be 
drawn from processes over their rss target.
Finally, it would be good to be aggressive about cleaning dirty pages of 
a process of the target, so pages clould be reclaimed quickly. There are 
a lot of factors in that, useless disk activity being one possible side 
effect.
