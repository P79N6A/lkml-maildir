As shown above, I did it. All three utilities fail.
I rechecked that rc3 works and found out that rc4 does not.
I also booted with init=/bin/sh and ran 'ip l set dev eth0 up'
- it fails under rc4, but works under rc3. This rules out
my userspace setup being somehow involved.
Config for rc4 is attached.
