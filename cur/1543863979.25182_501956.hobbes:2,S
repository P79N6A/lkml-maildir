Upgraded to bios 0802,  but still the same problem. I think it's
definitely something
about the r8169 driver. acpi=off doesn't help. turning on/off apic
also doesn't matter.
What exactly means msg "Netdev watchdog: Transmit timed out" ? I hope
the broblem
is just about that tx (dying when transmitting...), because otherwise
I'd start suspecting
hardware. (note: full-speed receive doesn't crash anything)
one thing more - have confirmed that the bug is reproducible on *any*
laptop with 8168,
not only Asus. I guess the disk-usage-crash was some other bug.
I'm gonna ask some other people with 8168Realtek NICs to test this, hope some of
them can reproduce this and get better view of what's going on...
thanks
