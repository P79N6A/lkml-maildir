Not to mention the fact that "foo = 0" generates extra (probably
unnecessary) code to initialize foo, while "foo = foo" just shuts up
the gcc warning without affecting generated code.
I'm already somewhat unconfortable shutting up these gcc warnings at
all, since adding these annotations add one more thing that must be
maintained -- I feel it would be all-too-easy to change the logic of a
function in a way that introduces a bug, and then have the annotation
hide a "is used uninitialised" warning.
But I definitely feel we shouldn't make our object code even slightly
worse just to shut up the warnings.
