Regardless of whether or not the idea is practical, where would the 
funding come from?  Who is going to donate their time?  What if they get 
bored of it and nobody wants to pick up?
There are enough of us working for free on this stuff, and those that 
get paid already have enough on their plate.  What you're asking for is 
something that just isn't practical.
When I first read this, I thought you were joking... unfortunately, it 
looks like you are being serious.

Why would we WANT to remove them?  Linux is just about the only 
operating system that will run well on all old machines.  If we were to 
remove these drivers from the kernel, we might as well all throw our old 
hardware into the garbage.

That's part of what subsystems and subsystem maintainers are for.  Looks 
like somebody thought ahead. ;-)
FYI, v4l/dvb drivers can be built separately from the kernel as modules, 
directly from our mercurial repository, and we try to keep them all 
backwards compatable with older vanilla kernels.  Surely there are other 
subsystems that do something similar.
