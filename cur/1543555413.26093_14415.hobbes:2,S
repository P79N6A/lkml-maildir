IMHO the pci tables look much cleaner without named initiliters.
They are really ugly if we nest structures and arrays.
The other argument for named initilizers don't aren't true in this
case too.  Neither there are lots of NULL-initilized fields nor is
there any reason to add new fields (the pci tables are external
API, because of MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE).
