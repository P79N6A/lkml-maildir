No, I misunderstood the question.  Implementing 32-bit atomic reads in assembler 
is redundant, because any sane compiler, *particularly* and optimizing compiler 
(and we're only in this mess because of optimizing compilers) will give us that 
automatically without the assembler.  Yes, it is legal for a compiler to violate 
this assumption.  It is also legal for us to refuse to maintain compatibility 
with compilers that suck this badly.  That decision was made a very long time 
ago, and I consider it the correct decision.
