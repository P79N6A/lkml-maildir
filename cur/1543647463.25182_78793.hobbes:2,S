Hi,
I am currently running 2.4.19 successfully on
my K7 based Debian 3.0 box.
I thought I would try to test the new 2.5 series
kernels, however having tried 2.5.40, 2.5.40-ac5,
2.5.41 and 2.5.41-ac2 I am unable to compile any of them !
they all fail in the drivers/video area.
I got my config file by copying the working
2.4.19 one over and running 'make oldconfig'
(is there an better way of migrating configs
between kernel series ?)
I have put my current config at
http://www.eclipse.co.uk/morgd/linux
  
could someone please check it and tell me how I have
broken things ?
(video card is radeon 7500)
best regards
dave morgan
