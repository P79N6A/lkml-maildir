Programs that do not support locales _must_ restrict themselves to
7-bit ASCII, or they are likely to break any number of things by 
outputting
invalid characters to the terminal.  You could quite easily replace the 
(C)
symbol with the string "Copyright", or you could pick a more complicated
solution by actually implementing locales, but you should change the
behavior of cdrecord, as that is broken/buggy.
