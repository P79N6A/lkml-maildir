What I want is for purely sequential workloads which far exceed cache
size (dd, updatedb, tar czf /backup/home.nightly.tar.gz /home) to avoid
thrashing my entire desktop out of memory.  I DON'T CARE if the tar
completed in 45 minutes rather than 80.  (It wouldn't, anyways, because
it only needs about 5 MB of cache to get every bit of the speedup it was
going to get.)  But the additional latency when I un-xlock in the
morning is annoying, and there is no benefit.
For a more useful example, ideally I *should not be able to tell* that
"dd if=/hde1 of=/hdf1" is running. [1]  There is *no* benefit to cacheing
more than about 2 pages, under this workload.  But with current kernels,
IME, that workload results in a gargantuan buffer cache and lots of
swapout of apps I was using 3 minutes ago.  I've taken to walking away
for some coffee, coming back when it's done, and "sudo swapoff
/dev/hda3; sudo swapon -a" to avoid the latency that is so annoying when
trying to use bloaty apps.
[1] obviously I'll see some slowdown due to interrupts and PCI
    bandwidth; that's not what I'm railing against, here.
