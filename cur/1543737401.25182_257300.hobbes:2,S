I think the problem of the holding mm->page_table_lock approach is
that it doesn't allow the migration code blocked. the semaphore
approach would be better.
I have another idea that each anonymous page can detach its swap entry
after its migration. It can be done by remove_exclusive_swap_page()
if the page is remapped to the same spaces forcibly by
touch_unmapped_address() I made.

The migration code allows each filesystem to implement its own
migration code or just use migrate_page_buffer() or
migrate_page_common(). 
migrate_page_common() is a default function if filesystem doesn't
implement anything. The function is the most generic and it tries
to writeback pages only if they are dirty and have buffers.

Yes, I know. I have checked all of the code.
AIO event buffers are pinned, therefore the memory-hotplug team plans
to make pages for the event buffers assigned to non-hotpluggable
memory regions.
And pages in sendfile() might be pinned for a while in case of network
problems. I think there may be some workarounds. The easiest way
is just waiting its timeout, and another way is changing the mode
of sendfile() to copy pages in advance. 
Pages for NFS also might be pinned with network problems.
One of the ideas is to restrict NFS to allocate pages from
specific memory region, sot that all memory except the region
can be hot-removed. And it's possible to implementing whole
migrate_page method, which may handled stuck pages.
If the migration code is used for memory defragmentation, pinned pages
must be avoided. I think it can be done with the non-blocking mode.

Thank you for that.
