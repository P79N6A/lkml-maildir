You're forgetting an important step. swsusp does not just haul off and
save the contents of memory. It has to quiesce the entire system first
by getting all hardware devices into a known state. THAT is the tricky
bit, with deadlock lurking around every corner.

That's relatively easy.

That's hard. REALLY, REALLY hard. Impossibly hard.
Make no mistake about it: You need to save and restore HARDWARE state as
well as software state (i.e. RAM image). The only practical way to do
that is to quiesce the system before you snapshot it. Your case is even
harder because you essentially want to revert to a previous point in time.
That means reverting fun things like your disk images (since the layout
of the data in your filesystem no longer matches what's in your outdated
RAM image) and how are you going to suck all those tx'ed network packets
back off the wire, anyway?
Your "simplifications" are really complexifications.
