Hi,
HW: Asus P2B Ultra2Wide onboard, 128MB, 2xPII350Mhz, Matrox G200
    BIOS APM on.
SW: RH5.2, kernel 2.2.0-pre2, SUSE matrox Xserver (DPMS on)
problem: during a normal session, all of a sudden (<30 sec of
inactivity) the 	
	 typical BIOS APM beep is produced followed by a total freeze of the
	 machine.
