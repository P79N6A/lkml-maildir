Only that ARM already has a NO_IRQ macro fairly well established for this
thing, which should probably be propagated to the other architectures.
Could we call it NO_IRQ instead?
I seem to remember that in the dim and distant past, several drivers
used to store IRQ numbers in byte-sized objects, so this would need to
be fixed before making NO_IRQ > 255.
