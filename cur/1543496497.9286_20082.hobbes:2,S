Hi there.
 >> This is wrong. In German, there is a big difference between "paar"
 >> and "Paar" (the first meaning "a few", the second "pair").
That's apparently correct...
 > The classic example:
 > "Ich habe liebe Genossen in Moskau" - I've got dead comreds in Moscow.
 > "Ich habe Liebe genossen in Moskau" - I enjoyed love in Moscow.
...but that apparently isn't...
Ich habe liebe Genossen in Moskau = I have friendly comrades in Moscow.
Ich habe Liebe genossen in Moskau = I enjoyed love in Moscow.
However, the fact that they have different meanings is definately
correct...
Best wishes from Riley.
