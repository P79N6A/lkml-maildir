So, I was brave ;-) and tried another go with this one. Seems to work 
this time. Still the issue with sustained write rate, but this time my 
mailer is still somewhat usable while writing. It gets to a crawl, but 
it still reacts....so I'd consider this a little progress (with the help 
of a regression).
