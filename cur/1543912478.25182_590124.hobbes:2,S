As said, if you make a bit of an effort to view the former SCSI stack as a 
unified storage midlayer the abberation becomes less abberational (if that's 
a word).
Real SCSI, the other SCSI transports and ATAPI would just use more of the 
common mid-layer than P/SATA would. I'd expect the way forward would be to 
just refactor things until someone notices that drivers/scsi is the wrong 
place for sd.c and sr.c and moves them to drivers/block or whereever.
Practically, the PATA driver gives me (almost) the same throughput as the 
old IDE driver does, and given that I need the former SCSI stack _anyway_ 
for my external USB harddrive, I don't see a pressing need to carry along 
yet another storage stack for my harddrive.
Rene.
