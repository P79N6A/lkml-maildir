I think the we should follow a rule like this: when allocating several
separate objects of the same type at the same time (like 10 "card"
structures) kcalloc should be used. When allocating one object (even
consisting of "several ints") kmalloc/kzalloc should be used. As far
as I can see the code just tries to allocate longish bitmap and so
kzalloc is better.
Better yet, why don't you DECLARE_BITMAP(cmd_pool_bits) and embed it
right into struct ctrl_info instead of dynamically allocating it?
