| Same question as before: Can baud really become zero at this point ? Also

Nothing, that code is completely wrong.  I've rewritten it now.  Thanks
for explaining.

| The check for B0 (hangup) was done earlier (see set_termios). So if you
| can end up with a requested baud rate being turned into 0 you need to
| bump it up to 1. If not you don't need the test.
Indeed, fixed as well.  New patch incoming in a few minutes.
I've also added the mutex protecting set_handshake, but I feel less
confident about whether that's the right approach, so feedback there is
also appreciated.
