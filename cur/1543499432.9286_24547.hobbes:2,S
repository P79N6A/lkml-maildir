I made a small hack for this, might be of some use:
http://www.uwsg.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/9902.2/0334.html
I think somewhere in the same thread there was a pointer
to a pretty complete toolkit from NIST that does delay
and much else besides, but I haven't looked into it further
than glancing at the feature list.
