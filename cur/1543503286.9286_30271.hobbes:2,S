reading lots of data you don't use is not good for performance.  also,
reading ahead in some instances, even if the data is useful, evicts some
cached data that may have to be read again.  i'm just suggesting that
reading ahead in a narrow and greedy way can be very destructive to
overall system performance.

yeah, that's basically the point :)

yes, that might even be useful if we're careful about it, and i think i
can give that a try.
