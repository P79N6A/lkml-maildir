Policy ultimately has to be updated in order to start writing allow
rules based on the new class/perm.  libselinux et al doesn't have to
change.
If you have a "SELinux:  policy loaded with handle_unknown=allow"
message in your /var/log/messages, then new classes/perms that are not
yet known to the policy will be allowed by default, so the operation
will be permitted by the kernel.
