Ah, my apologies!
I read "I'll work on your advice, but it feels too risky" as describing 
my advice as too risky, rather than the changeset currently in the kernel.
IMO the changeset should be resubmitted as two changes, separating the 
probe behavior changes from the platform driver conversion.  They are 
two distinct changes, and that would allow git-bisect to identify the 
culprit easily if future breakage occurs.
