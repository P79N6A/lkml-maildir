Hi Alan,
Following six patches for swsusp that were used by various people
through swsusp list. They should apply in order to 2.4.19-pre10-ac2.
Most of those is already in 2.5.22 suspend part managed by Pavel.
1/6	Documentation and comments cleanings
2/6	Fixing some compilation configuration problem, cleaning code
 	and making suspension stuff printk on a pretty console
3/6	Fix possible endless loop in ide-suspend stuff when using
 	removable devices
4/6	Fix swap signature in case of noresume option
5/6	Use memeat to make suspension of *big* sessions possible
6/6	Clean SysRq stuff.
    	Clean obsolete PF_KERNTHREAD flag.
    	Manage kernel threads: bdflush, khubd, nfs shares (lockd, rpciod), kjournald, kreiserfsd.
I've tested the patches sequentially and made one compilation of each. 
If you agree to apply them, this should achieve partial merge between
your tree and what I call swsusp-beta8
Sincerely,
