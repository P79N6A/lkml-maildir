ok, had a second look.
it does check for errors, using BAD_ADDR which is: if (addr > TASK_SIZE)
and TASK_SIZE on the other hand is PAGE_OFFSET == 0xC0000000 (for x86)
hmm, which means even if we correctly map an area > PAGE_OFFSET, we will 
never free the area (well another question is, if we ever try to map
an area > PAGE_OFFSET) - but nevertheless, the check should be before
trying to mmap, and checking for IS_ERR after mmap.
nyone explain what to do if we cannot map the page for MMAP_PAGE_ZERO?
- we just ignore it for now ...
also another instance: if (addr != req_address) - which means if we have
	some alignment with mmap - load_elf_library just bails out.
	guess we need to munmap also (if no error occured during mmap)
do_brk() is _never_ checked for return (at least in binfm_elf) ... oh
well ...
any comments?
