that I don't believe for a second unfortunately.
It's really really trivial to just do a shar archive or similar that
then executes the binary... or otherwise "pack" the elf binary in such a
way that it bypasses your check. 
If you said "this is for DRM purposes" I could buy that partially.
But... to protect against malware? Not at all. Not even a little bit.
There's so many ways on normal systems to bypass this that malware
doesn't even suffer one tiny bit from this.
