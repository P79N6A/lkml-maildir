Basically, I would like to agree. 
But, there is no way to roll back from here now.
If online_node_map is set once, then new pgdat might be touched.
There is no way to disable them.
And I suppose it is not good thing that creating sysfs file of new node
before setting online_node_map. It means user interface is shown
before system initialization completion.
(In addition, remove_memory() is not yet....)
If return code of arch_register_node is ignored, 
cpu hotplug will work without new node's file.
When we tried cpu hotplug on it, it was cause of stack dump at last.

Nope. I just tried cross compile.
I want powerpc box for test....
Thanks.
