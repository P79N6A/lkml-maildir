Subject: [PATCH] document sysenter path
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/2/10/376

This path isn't obvious. It looks as if the kernel will be taking
three args from the user stack, but it only takes one from there.

+ * The caller puts arg2 in %ecx, which gets pushed. The kernel will use
+ * %ecx itself for arg2. The pushing is because the sysexit instruction
+ * (found in entry.S) requires that we clobber %ecx with the desired %esp.
+ * User code might expect that %ecx is unclobbered though, as it would be
+ * for returning via the iret instruction, so we must push and pop.
+ *
+ * The caller puts arg3 in %edx, which the sysexit instruction requires
+ * for %eip. Thus, exactly as for arg2, we must push and pop.
+ *
+ * Arg6 is different. The caller puts arg6 in %ebp. Since the sysenter
+ * instruction clobbers %esp, the user's %esp won't even survive entry
+ * into the kernel. We store %esp in %ebp. Code in entry.S must fetch
+ * arg6 from the stack.
