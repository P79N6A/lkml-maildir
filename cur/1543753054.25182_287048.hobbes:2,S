Stupid question - how do I get a modular drm?
I usually make everything compiled-in with no module support.
But now I made a kernel with module support and selected "M"
for the agp stuff and for the radeon and matrox DRM support.
But DRM itself will only accept Yes or No, Module is not an
option there with "make menuconfig".  So I can load
and unload the radeon module now, but there is no DRM module.
loading/unloading radeon gives me messages from DRM about this
happening, but DRM itself is compiled in so I can't modprobe it
with that debug parameter.
Is there perhaps something in some other menu that needs to be (M)
before (M) becomes an option for DRM?
