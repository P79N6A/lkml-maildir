My position is simple: the ld.so problem needs a better
solution than the current one. The current one, for example,
still allows to use ld.so directly to execute the files for
which you do not have an exec permission. And that's not an
only problem...

And allow an attacker to store his files on that partition,
and then execute them.

There is no "mmap + mprotect" here - only mmap was changed.

I have already proposed another solution for ld.so problem
3 times. That fact doesn't make it a good solution of course,
but obviously you haven't had a look.
