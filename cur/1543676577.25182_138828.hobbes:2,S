If I read the source correctly, unregister_netdevice() simply does rip the 
device out and sees what happens? It's a bit primitive, but should of 
course work too.
I'm just not sure if that model works that well in other parts too, I 
think file systems don't really like it, if the device under them 
disappears. Any kind of automatic module unloading also becomes a bit 
difficult without a module use count. I also hope no net driver starts 
exporting it's own data via sysfs (I currently don't see anything that 
would protect this).
BTW does anything protect the get_stats() call in netstat_attr_show()?
bye, Roman
