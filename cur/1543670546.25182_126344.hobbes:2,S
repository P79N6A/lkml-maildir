Typing 
<any command> &<TAB>
gives the shell and the fs some work to do.  The "&" ends one
command and starts a new one (similiar to ";") so typing
nothing more after "&" and pressing <TAB> makes the shell search the entire
path and consider all the commands available.
(Press tab some more times and see the list, 2078 possibilities
in my case. :-)  This sort of thing can easily
take some time (in D state) if your PATH includes network drives.
