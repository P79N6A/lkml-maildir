Hans, that's not what we're discussing in this thread.  I don't give a shit
whether filesystem A is fater than filesystem B on task C.  Really, how
fast a fs is an implementation details.
I also still think someone who does most work in the last years on a fs
(Chris on reiserfs v3) should be considered maintainer, but that's just my
2cents and I'd rather leave that to you guys.
The important part is xattr/acl/namespace semantics.  In Linux those
semantics are at the _VFS_ level, not at the individual filesystem,
in fact if a fs can mess with namespace semantics I'd almost considere
that a bug.
So if you want different xattr/acl semantics after you ignored all the
discussion has been going on the last years start *now* to discuss you
proposal on -fsdevel, and acl-devel, explaining why your semantics are
better and hash out the implementation details to support both
transparently.
Funneling in new semantics through a low level driver is pretty much
always wrong.
