We don't use f_pos (any more), we call llseek.
I think it would make a lot of sense - as Trond suggests - to not pass
O_LARGEFILE to dentry_open for an NFSv2 request.  Then ext3 could
trigger off that and return 64bits of cookie ... and I think nfsd will
actually pass them all back to the client now.  There is a
truncate-to-32bits bug that has only just been fixed.
But if a separate call is wanted, we have the export_operations struct
to put it in.  All we need is a good case an useful specification.

I think Trond has answered this, but I think it is also worth noting
that every entry returned in a READDIR reply includes a cookie, the
NFS client may use any of those cookies in a subsequent READDIR.  One
might hope the client will only ever use the last, but one can never
be sure....
