Well..  That's a problem which only I can reproduce, and that only after
applying sched patches while performing strange acts upon small animals.
Plus I don't think we're close to fixing it.
More serious matters would be:
- The x86_64-goes-oom-due-to-bio-using-GFP_DMA bug.  I'll send the patch
  over today.
- The some-ati-timers-go-too-fast bug.  I'll sndn that patch today as
  well.
- Neil is sitting on a radi1 BIO leak fix which we need.
- It would be nice to get Martin MOKREJ
  <mmokrejs@ribosome.natur.cuni.cz>'s full 16GB recognised again.  Dave
  Hansen is working on that.
-

 seems to be a recent
  XFS regression.
- Matthew Grant <grantma@anathoth.gen.nz>'s "rt_sigsuspend() does not
  return EINTR on 2.6.16-rc2+" might be a new poll() bug, but that one's
  hard and I suspect we'll need the extra testers which 2.6.16 will give to
  be able to work out whether it's real and what the fix is.
- 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6177
 _looks_ like a serious
  TCP regression, but that happened between 2.6.14 and 2.6.15 and that's
  the only report I've seen.
Plus lots of other stuff, probably.
