   It looks like you're using the wrong driver here. Jeff's patch is
for libata, which is an implementation of SATA drivers in the SCSI
layer. You'll find the libata driver options under the SCSI menu in
the kernel config. Try disabling the pure IDE layer driver (in
"ATA/ATAPI/MFM/RLL support"), and go to the "SCSI low-level drivers"
menu, and enable "Serial ATA (SATA) support".
CONFIG_SCSI_SATA=y
CONFIG_SCSI_SATA_SIL=y
