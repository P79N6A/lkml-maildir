Marcelo,
after a fairly lengthy off-list discussion, it turns out that
special-casing printk is probably the best way to proceed
to fix this one.
The problem is that the boot processor sets up the console drivers,
and is able to call them via printk(), but the application processors
at that time are not able to call printk() because the console device
driver mappings are not set up.  Undoing this inside the ia64 boot code is
complex and fragile.   Possibly the problem exists on other platforms
but hasn't been discovered yet.
So the patch defines an architecture-specific macro `arch_consoles_callable()'
which, if not defined, defaults to `1', so the impact to other platforms
(and to uniprocessor ia64) is zero.
