I was wondering if someone could tell me what's happening in kernel
development with regard to the sound system.
From reading the mailing list I've noted there is work happening regarding
maintaining the OSS modules.
But I thought ALSA modules where slowly taking their place.  I note ALSA
4.1c has support for the much talked about devfs, so it looks like they are
reacting to the kernel development.
Am I incorrect in my assumption?
And a couple quick non-kernel specific questions.
Which is better OSS/Free or ALSA??  Why??
Will ALSA become dominant eventually?
