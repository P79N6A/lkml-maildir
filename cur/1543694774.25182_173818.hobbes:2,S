Subject: [PM][ACPI] No ACPI interrupts after resume from S1

Hi,
Suspending and resuming from S1 disables ACPI interrupts for my machine
(ASUS L3800C laptop). No further interrupts and events are generated,
/proc/interrupts shows no change w.r. to ACPI. This happens regardless of
whether the specific IRQ is shared or not.
Versions affected: 2.6.0-test[5-8], 2.6.0-test5-mm4, 2.6.0-test6-mm4.
Versions unaffected: 2.6.0-test3, 2.4.22 with 20030918 ACPI.
Note: it seems that running a pmdisk cycle after resume from S1 reenables
the interrupts somehow (though treat it as a not-thoroughly-tested
observation for now).

 may contain information relevant
to the matter (DSDT, dmesg, etc.).
I'll be happy to provide any further info.
Best regards,
