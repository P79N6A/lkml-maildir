The base address and length are the same either way, instead its
__ioremap that's failing at "if(!PageReserved(page))"[ioremap.c:142].
I've also narrowed down the issue to only occur w/ (CONFIG_X86_4G=y &&
CONFIG_NUMA=y) so it looks like its a propblem w/ 4G and discontigmem
together. 
I've also finally moved to -mm4 and reproduced the problem there.
Martin: Any ideas?
