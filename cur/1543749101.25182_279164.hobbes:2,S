Hi,
2.6.10-rc3-mm1 patch:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/axboe/patches/v2.6/2.6.10-rc3-mm1/cfq-time-slices-14-2.6.10-rc3-mm1.gz
2.6-BK patch:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/axboe/patches/v2.6/2.6.10-rc3/cfq-time-slices-14.gz
Changes:
- Fix leak of queue
- Better balance when to preempt. On 8 client read workload, aggregate
  bandwidth would take a few seconds to build up, due to initial massive
  preempt generation more seeks than it should. Priority check was also
  reverse which showed bad results on multi-prio work loads.
- Fix reversed priority check in preemption check, oops.
