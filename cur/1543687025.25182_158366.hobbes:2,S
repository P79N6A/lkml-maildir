I am not a kernel developer, but for what it's worth, I applied the ACPI 
patch from acpi.sourceforge.net for 2.6.0-test2 to my test2 kernel, then 
patched it up to test3, and my ACPI works at least as well as it did under 
2.4.21.
I imagine that you could cleanly apply the test2 ACPI patch to the test3 
sources, so that might be worth a try for you, or you could wait a couple of 
days and see if the ACPI folks produce a new patch for test3...
Cheers,
Matt
