You obviously don't understand the implications of the "effective" and the
"allowed" capabilities masks.  Your worries about being restricted to
"subsets or supersets" of capabilities if suid isn't changed are unfounded,
and worse, are sending people off on blind tangents.  None of the suid stuff
needs behavior modification.
