Hmm, ok. It need some changes since sys_dup() and F_DUPFD uses common code 
at the moment, but it'd ok.
Basically, everything that calls get_unused_fd() can get the magic 
indirect_syscall() settings. I was just planning to localize the 
sequential/non-sequential behaviour just in there.
The sys_dup(), sys_dup2() and F_DUPFD have some custom code, although 
sys_dup() should really use get_unused_fd() in any way.
