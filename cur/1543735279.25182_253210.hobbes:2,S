Andrew,
The first patch in this series is a replacement patch for the prempt-fix
patch I sent earlier this morning.  There was a missing paren in that
previous version.
Adding this to 2.6.9-rc2-mm1 (just after lockmeter-2.patch) fixes the
preempt compile problem on ia64, at least.  However, I then started 
getting a missing symbol for generic_raw_read_trylock.  Hence the second
patch of this series.
(It is the nature of this lockmeter fix for the COOL bits that whenever
a change is made to kernel/spinlock.c, you need to make a correspoding
change to the kernel/lockmeter.c code that parallels spinlock.c. I 
don't see any good way around this.)
Finally, Zwane has suggested making in_lock_functions() an inline.
I sent him and you a simple patch to do that, and if that is applied,
you then need the third patch of this series.
All three of these patches are intended to follow lockmeter-2.patch in
the series.
I compiled lockmeter on/off, preempt on/off (all 4) kernels on ia64.
I'm working on doing that for i386, but my i386 machines are much slower
than an 8-way Altix for doing compiles. :-)  I'll test some of these
as well.
Best Regards,
Ray
