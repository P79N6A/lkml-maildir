With the swapin-deadlock fixed properly I was not able to deadlock the
machine anymore... except when using swapfiles > 128mbyte (swap version
2). The probelem is been pointed out to me by Bernd. The bug is that the
header page of the swapfile, was considered a "usable" page for swapout
data. So nr_swap_pages never reached 0. So the complexity of get_swap_page
and so of swap_out() was increasing of an order of magnitude during OOM
conditions. It wasn't a deadlock but the complexity of the code grown so
much that I had to wait more than 5 minutes to get the faulting task
killed.
(btw mkswap calls the new swap header as `version 1', while the kernel
calls it `version 2' and the on-disk signature is SWAPSPACE2 and not
SWAPSPACE1... :)
With the bug fixed now the faulting task gets killed in less than one
second. Here it is the fix against 2.2.10. I propose it for inclusion into
2.2.11:

(btw, using i or swap_header->info.nr_badpages is the same thing in such
place, but looks more robust using swap_header->info.nr_badpages :)

PS. Bernd could you repeat your OOM test with this patch applyed on the
top of the previous OOM fixes?
