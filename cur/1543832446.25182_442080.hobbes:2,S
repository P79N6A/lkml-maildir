No, that was not what I tried to say. Just now, swsusp looks pretty
small (~1000 lines), way too many people use it, and it is too handy
for debugging. So I'm not trying to kill it just now. When klibc gets
into mainline, and pretty much everyone switches to uswsusp, yes, it
will be possible to remove swsusp. For now I'm just trying to keep it
stable and not add features to it, so it is as easy to maintain as
possible.
First sign of swsusp going out is going to be /sys/power/resume
disappearing. It is really badly documented/dangerous hack, and if
your distro uses initrd, anyway.. well you should probably just use
swsusp. It would be nice to remove it in year or two.
I wanted to point out that delay between "okay, I want this gone" and
the code disappearing from kernel tarball is about a year.
