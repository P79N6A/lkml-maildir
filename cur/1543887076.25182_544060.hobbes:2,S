Thanks for the explanation. I never saw those other front-end
drivers, perhaps because for lack of information I just chose
the default of "N" on this one.

Well, as it stands, I am presented with that option but I don't
have the faintest idea what "ESP" is and whether it would even
be worth attempting to compile it. I would have preferred to
see at least a short explanation of the term in order to decide
whether it would be worth trying.
Thanks,
