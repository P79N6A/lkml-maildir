I face these problems very often when I compile kernel in old 166 MHz
machine system often freezes during compilation and that machine is
having ext2 filesystem after rebooting the system some inodes are
deleted and then I start getting funny errors. So 'git diff' tells me
which files are broken and then 'git reset --hard origin' again
provide me working system :-)
