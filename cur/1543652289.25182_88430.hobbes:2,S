So what will it do? Must do something very much like what I described or
it is a noop period. Please elaborate.

O_SYNC/-osync waits on writes too, so are you saying writes must go to
the head because of that? reads should be not too bad at the end too if
only the queue wasn't that oversized when the merging is at its maximum.
Fix the oversizing of the queue, then read-latency will matter much
less.
