I'm guessing not, just because the monitor probably hasn't even
refreshed at that point ;) But...

You make good points. What's more, I don't think anyone needs to
advocate the RT work on the basis that it improves interactiveness.
That path is just going to lead to unwinnable arguments and will
distract from the real measurable improvements that it does bring.
I think anyone who doesn't like that won't be convinced because
someone is telling them it improves interactiveness ;)
Now lest I create a negative image of myself, I'd like to say that
without looking at the code, it sounds quite nice and if it can be
nicely encapsulated and CONFIGurable then I don't see why it
can't eventually be included.
