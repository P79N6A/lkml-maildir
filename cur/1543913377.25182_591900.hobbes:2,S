sysfs, and you were on the discussion (your idea won, basically....)
And the way I see it, it got merged.
Commit 042f10ec6533e53181284c96d22ae051e49ac707
As I further see it, this CONFIG_VT_UNICODE patch defines the 
starting value for the default.
E.g. CONFIG_VT_UNICODE=y, you start with utf8, and can, at will, at 
runtime, change it. CONFIG_VT_UNICODE=n, you start with 8bit, and can, 
at will, at runtime, too, change it ;-)
