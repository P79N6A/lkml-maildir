Thanks Tigran.  You are right.  I have one additional 
variable/parameter pair being passed on that append line.  
The console=tty0 is the last variable/parameter pair passed.  
I'll have to boot my laptop and check to character count.
BTW:  Is that character limit documented?  Is there some 
important reason why that constraint is placed on the
length of the append line.  It seems quite arbitrary and
unnecessarily restrictive.
I will test test5 ASAP.  Thanks for the information regarding
the kmem_cache_alloc() fix.
