Ugh...  Considering that all of that is _only_ for /proc/<pid>/task and
that proc_permission() is a couple of function calls, why bother with
proc_task_check_root() instead of just adding proc_task_permission() with
{
	struct dentry *root;
	struct vfsmount *vfsmnt;
	if (generic_permission(inode, mask, NULL) != 0)
		return -EACCES;
	/* or just open-code it here, for that matter */
	if (proc_task_root_link(inode, &root, &vfsmnt))
		return -ENOENT;
	return proc_check_chroot(root, vfsmnt);
}
for a body and leaving proc_permission() without any changes at all?

Right.  The real question is whether the current behaviour makes any sense.
I've no objections to your patch + modification above, but I really wonder
if we should keep current rules in that area.
