It may be better to add it to __activate_task() rather than after the
single activate_task() use.  At the time I wrote the patch I did not
think to look at the five __activate_task() calls to see if they each
needed the test.  By me not looking, my patch is automatically
incorrect, even if it turns out to be correct.
