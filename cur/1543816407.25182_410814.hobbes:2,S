Hi,
Part of a fix for APM Screen Blanking in
arch/i386/apm.c:apm_console_blank() from Jordan Crouse was:
-       if (error == APM_NOT_ENGAGED) {
+       if (error == APM_NOT_ENGAGED && state != APM_STATE_READY) {
for "Prevent[ing] the error message from printing out twice."
However, this puts the "apm: set display: Interface not engaged"
error back on armada laptops (which was the original need for this if
statement).
I don't see how the error message can get printed twice. Anyway,
a double message on some machines is better than a error on other
machines...
Regards,
Samuel
