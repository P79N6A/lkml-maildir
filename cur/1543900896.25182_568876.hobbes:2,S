I'm pretty sure that no ppc64 machine needs alias resolution in the kernel,
although some are VIPT. Last time we discussed this, Segher explained it
to me, but I don't remember which way Cell does it. IIRC, it automatically
flushes cache lines that are accessed through aliases.
It's probably a good idea to have the flush_kernel_dcache_page() in there
anyway, if only to serve as an example for people that copy it into
architecture-independent drivers, same as what we do for the
k{,un}map_atomic() that is also not required on ppc64.
