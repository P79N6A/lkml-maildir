From a practical point of view that currently means 'delete Linus tree pcmcia
regardless of what you are doing' since the modules from David Hinds and Linus
pcmcia are not 100% binary compatible for all cases.
It isnt possible for anyone to ship a useful system with Linus pcmcia unless
the ISA stuff is fixed
