Is that really a major issue for ps?

I can live with that level of pain if my benchmark doesn't get
driven into the wall by the tools that are meant to be montoring
it ...
I'm sure there are bigger rocks to be thrown at it as well, and
ugly critters to be found under those rocks, but I don't see anything
insurmountable here yet. Whereas opening billions of files is just
unworkable.
Better still, you seem like an excellent candidate to propose a good 
design that's efficient and workable?

Heh ;-) 
A hostile takeover might suffice here, if necessary ...
