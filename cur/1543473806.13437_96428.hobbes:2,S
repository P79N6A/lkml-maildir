You seem to have hit the system-wide inode maximum... I don't know why :)
To see how many you have used, do this:
cat /proc/sys/kernel/inode-nr  
To check what your system-wide limit is:
cat /proc/sys/kernel/inode-max 
If inode-nr == inode-max, then this is indeed your problem.
To increase your system-wide maximum:
echo "32768" > /proc/sys/kernel/inode-max
(You will have to add this to your rc files if you want it to work across
reboots - this doesn't write anything to your kernel)
Note that 32768 is probably waay to much...
