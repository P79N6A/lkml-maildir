Have any of the core developers had any comments about it? Are there any
arguments for why it should not be folded into the kernel?

It would be a blessing, especially if the journaling Ext2 or Reiserfs
stuff was also folded into 2.4 as well. The lack of a LVM and a JFS have
unfortunately kept any serious Linux use out of our shop for a while
now.
