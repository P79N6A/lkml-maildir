A unknown-compressed initrd is as good or as bad as a corrupted rd.
The kernel can't decide if it's got /dev/random or e.g. a RAR archive.
Therefore it must and should behave the same.

If there is no initrd, you won't get a panic. If you use a gzip initrd
with a bz2-only kernel what do you expect? What do you expect if you
say "root=/dev/internal-disk", but /dev/usb/attacker's-USB-stick is
currently the only working alternative?
I think having a kernel parameter ist the right thing, since it
won't decrease security, it gives everything you want and it allows
you to skip even "good" initrds if they turn out not to be good.

"Warning, I'm starting a setup which you didn't intend to start
 at all! Muahahahaha, good luck!"
