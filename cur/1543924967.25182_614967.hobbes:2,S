Works for me. The only remaining stalls are sub second and look
completely valid, considering the amount of files being removed.

I'm pleased to note that this is now much faster again.
Thanks!

CC's please note: It looks like this was really a different problem
then the 100% iowait that was seen with reiserfs.
Also the one complete stall I have seen is probably something else.
But I have not been able to reproduce this again with -mm and have
never seen this on mainline, so I will just ignore that single event
until I see it again.
