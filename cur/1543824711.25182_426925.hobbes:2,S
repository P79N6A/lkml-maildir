I am a bit confused about the need for Davids patch. set_page_dirty() is 
already a notification that a page is to be dirtied. Why do we need it 
twice? set_page_dirty could return an error code and the file system can 
use the set_page_dirty() hook to get its notification. What we would need 
to do is to make sure that set_page_dirty can sleep.
