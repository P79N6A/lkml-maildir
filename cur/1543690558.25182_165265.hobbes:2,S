    No it should just work on 2.4.21.  You may want to try 2.4.22 if you 
aren't using dma on harddrive. "hdparm -d /dev/hda"

   Yes with newer versions of the e1000 driver.  (2.4.21 should be new 
enough.)  Newer kernel revs may have issues networking issues if you are 
enabling acpi.  Try "pci=noacpi" if you have issues.
