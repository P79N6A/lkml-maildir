I'm stuck. AFAICS CPU0 hangs within an bottom half handler, and CPU1
executes
global_cli() in rs_write() [linux/drivers/char/serial.c]
wait_on_irq() doesn't print enough informations to locate the problem. How
often does the server hang? I have a patch which would extend the debugging
information if the problem happens again.
