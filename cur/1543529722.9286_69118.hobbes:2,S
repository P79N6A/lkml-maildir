Al,
is Minix maintained? Minix is a tiny filesystem, and it might be simpler
for the reiserfs developers if they could mimic Minix instead of ext2.

The problem is not stability, Al is afraid of intentional attacks again
the filesystem:
e.g multiple thread try to
* create a file, create a directory with the same name.
* unlink a directory, and create an entry in that directory.
* open a file with O_TRUNC, and another thread writes to the file,
perhaps O_APPEND
... [I'm no expert of the VFS, so I don't know which races are possible]
normal stress tests are unable to find such bugs.
[But I didn't read you patch]
