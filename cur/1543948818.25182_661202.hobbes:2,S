I've been encountering the need for SO_REUSEPORT as implemented on some BSD
for instance. It allows any process to explicitly permit another one to bind
to the same IP:port provided that it also sets its socket with SO_REUSEPORT.
This is a real requirement when you need to restart a service without any
service disruption.
In the end, I've written a trivial patch for 2.4 (but most likely 2.6 would
use nearly the same one). I noticed that the conflict detection logic already
distinguished between 3 cases: sk->reuse==0, sk->reuse==1, sk->reuse >1.
sk->reuse was set to 1 with SO_REUSEADDR. I simply had to make SO_REUSEPORT
do sk->reuse |= 2 to get everything working as expected.
I don't know yet if it is as easy to do in 2.6, but if there is a possible
acceptance of including this useful feature into mainline, I can try to
work a patch (possibly cleaner than my existing one for 2.4).
