Here's my attempt at part 7of6 to complete the removal of references
to PCI.  This time I fixed all the comments and printk() messages.
I even checked that it compiles on x86_64/em64t.
There will be some small amount of fuzz in this patch as I started
applying from a base that included a patch from Alex Williamson.
Andi: earlier you had made positive noises about moving
swiotlb.c up to lib/ ... now we have a specific implementation
can you confirm that you are still OK with this.  If you are,
then I'll put this whole series into my test tree so it will
get into the next -mm release.
