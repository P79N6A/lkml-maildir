I'm suspecting a problem in the reporting scripts.  The patch had:
From: Stas Sergeev <stsp@aknet.ru>
Attached patch works around the corruption of the high word of the ESP
register, which is the official bug of x86 CPUs.  The bug triggers only
when the one is using the 16bit stack segment, and is described here:

From: Oleg Nesterov <oleg@tv-sign.ru>
  I think that Stas tries to steal 1024 bytes from kernel's memory.
