Looks like it would be beneficial if someone, preferably with some
authority ;-), would try to get Tyan and/or AMD to reveal this
information.
I have read the docs for the AMD768 chipset numerous times, but I least
I (okay okay, I am not the expert here ;-)) cannot find anything that
would prevent this from working correctly.
AFAIK Tyan has been more or less cooperative with linux developers in
the past?! I'd be more than happy to ask them, but I don't think they
will take me very serious
