Hello
I have 2.6.7 kernel and I want only apply supermount patch. I downloaded 
supermount-ng204.diff from ck6 splitout.  I copied it into /usr/src.  
Here I  cd linux-2.6.7. From linux-2.6.7 I run patch -p1 < 
../supermount-ng204.diff
And I got this:
patch unexpectedly ends in middle of line
patch: **** Only garbage was found in the patch input.
What is the problem here? How to cerrectly applied this patch?
Thanx
Marian Tomko
