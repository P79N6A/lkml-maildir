Yes, Torben, you are corrent, the IDE drive is just a spare
used for doing nightly backups of the SCSI system partitions.
We've been using 80GB/120GB WD drives in many OSB4/CSB5-based
HP/Compaq systems (mostly this Proliant model, HP E800 and HP
TC3100) with hand-enabled DMA and have so far had no problems.
(Btw, this particular ML350G3 came with an add-on cciss hwraid
card that seemed to exhibit extremely poor performance, so we
attached all the SCSI drives directly to the onboard AIC7xxx
and went for /dev/md*.)
Thanks,
