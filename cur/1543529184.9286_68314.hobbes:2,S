Hi all.
Is there anybody here that can advise me regarding either pppd or
ipchains, or better still both?
Problem 1: I have pppd set up to dial out on my modem /dev/ttyS2
           using wvdial as the dialling engine. How do I set the
           system up to allow dial-in on the SAME port using the
           auto-PPP authentication and switching?
Problem 2: I have been able to set up kernel 2.2.12 to forward IP
           traffic by masquerading it as itself. How do I set it
           up WITHOUT the masquerading?
The problems relate to different computers, both configured with
RedHat 6.1 and using the kernels as supplied, without compiling
any special kernels.
Any advice much appreciated...
Best wishes from Riley.
