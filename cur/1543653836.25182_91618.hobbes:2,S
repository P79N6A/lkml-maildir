I also tried it, but it is not that big a difference:
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename  flags
1991125  306324  270484 2567933  272efd vmlinux    -fomit-frame-pointer
1981477  306324  270484 2558285  27094d vmlinux    
1990965  306324  270484 2567773  272e5d vmlinux    -momit-leaf-frame-pointer
this was with gcc 2.95.3 and binutils 2.12 on my lfs system
