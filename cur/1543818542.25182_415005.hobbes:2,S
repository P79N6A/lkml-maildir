PPC doesn't have a ZONE_DMA... PPC assumes that the whole memory is
DMA'able... What happens here is that it works by "chance" on x86 ;)
ZONE_DMA is a thing of the past that represents ISA DMA (below 16M iirc
or something like that). Thus x86 historically maintained a separate
allocation zone down there for ISA devices. What happens here is that
the x86 code sort-of detects that the DMA mask isn't the full 32 bits
and kicks everything down into ZONE_DMA. Makes things work, though the
pressure on ZONE_DMA can often be high enough that you'll have a lot of
failed allocations ...
PPC doesn't have ZONE_DMA, thus can't provide memory guaranteed to be
below that limit.
Now, for ppc32, it should still sort-of work because all of lowmem is
below 1Gb and people generally don't hack their lowmem size (well, I do
but heh, that doesn't count :) and I don't think you'll get skb's in
highmem. But ppc64 hits the problem and at this point, there is nothing
I can do other than either implementing a split zone allocation mecanism
in the ppc64 architecture for the sole sake of bcm43xx (ick !) or doing
some trick with the iommu...
Ben.
