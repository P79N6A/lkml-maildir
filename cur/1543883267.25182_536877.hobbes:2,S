i think this online definition matches what i have in mind:

"A deprecated element or attribute is one that has been outdated by
newer constructs. Deprecated elements are defined in the reference
manual in appropriate locations, but are clearly marked as deprecated.
Deprecated elements may become obsolete in future versions of HTML. We
recommend that authors avoid using deprecated elements and attributes
whenever practical."
  note carefully how deprecated elements can still be used, but their
use is discouraged and they *may become obsolete*.  that's exactly
what i was getting at.  deprecated stuff *might* still be used;
obsolete stuff *shouldn't* be used.

p.s.  just FYI, even *i'm* getting bored of this.  :-)
