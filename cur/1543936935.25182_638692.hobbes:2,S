| Add a filename option (default to 0)
| in order to get the following summary output:
| ./scripts/checkpatch.pl --filename --file ./arch/sparc/kernel/apc.c 
| ...
| ...
| ...
| ./arch/sparc/kernel/apc.c --> total: 18 errors, 3 warnings, 186 lines checked

| Andy, 
| I wonder why checkpatch doesn't show all the command line options. 
| At the moment, it only prints:
| options: -q           => quiet
| 	--no-tree    => run without a kernel tree
|         --terse      => one line per report
|         --emacs      => emacs compile window format
|         --file       => check a source file
|         --strict     => enable more subjective tests
|         --root       => path to the kernel tree root
| 
| but I see a lot more options:
| 	q|quiet
| 	tree
| 	signoff
| 	patch
| 	test-type
| 	emacs
| 	terse
| 	file
| 	subjective
| 	strict
| 	root=s
| 	summary
| 	mailback
|

Hi Paolo,
the options you're complaining about (in most) are enabled by default so
there is no reason to 'turn them on' explicitly /methink/.
