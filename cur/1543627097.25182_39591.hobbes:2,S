OK I got it... My Alpha works now.
I must have been an idiot. :o)
One of the harddrives seems to have errors. After reinstalling
RedHat on the other drive. tune2fs -j -c0 -i0 /dev/sda[1,3,4,5]
Editing fstab, rebooting.
Crashing the system via the halt button. Restarting -> System
recovers the journal and then YIPIEEE(!) no more errors.
Everything works!
Thanks to everyone who helped me with this f***in' problem.
Especially to Stephen Tweedie, Jochen Buehler and
Peter Leif Rasmussen...

PS: I'm now running kernel 2.4.18-grsec-1.9.4 :o)
PPS: I guess it's now up to RedHat to build a nice Kernel-RPMs
and release (together with Compaq) RedHat 7.2 Alpha Edition. :o)
