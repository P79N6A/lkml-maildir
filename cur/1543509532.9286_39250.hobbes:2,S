I sat down for a couple of evenings and kludged bttv-0.6.4f into stock
2.3.18 (trying to avoid stepping on Alan's toes with the new SMP/etc
stuff).
It Works For Me [tm], and nothing seems like it should be broken. i've
tested against a WinTV 401, both as modules and monolithic.
the patch can be found at 
<URL:
http://jbm.strlen.net/bttv-0.6.4f-kernel-2.3.18-jbm.patch.gz>,
 it's
rather large and not terribly well done (it's my first patch, and i've got
new files and recursiveness to deal with! i'm sorry!)
i've tested it as well as i practically can (WinTV 401, both as modular
and monolithic), and both seem to work ok.
please contact me with feedback on this, but also send replies to the
appropriate lists to draw on other people's knowledge (i honestly don't
fully understand the code. i just understood how to put the two pieces
together).
