there's interbench, written by Con (with the purpose of improving 
RSDL/SD), which does exactly that, but vanilla and SD performs quite the 
same in those tests.
it's quite hard to test interactivity, because it's both subjective and 
because even for objective workloads, things depend so much on exact 
circumstances. So the best way is to wait for actual complaints, and/or 
actual testcases that trigger badness, and victims^H^H^H^H^H testers.
(also note that often it needs _that precise_ workload to trigger some 
badness. For example make -j depends on the kind of X shell terminal 
that is used - gterm behaves differently from xterm, etc.)
