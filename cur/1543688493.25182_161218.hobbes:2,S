	He's saying that with 2^128 possible hash values, you get a collision with
50% probability with roughly 2^64 pictures. Analogously for the birthday
paradox, with 365 possible birthdays (about 2^8), you get a collision with
50% probability with less than 30 people (about 2^5).
	Now does 5 really seem to be that much less than 8? His math is right and
so is yours. With 2^N possible values, all equally likely, you get a
collision with 50% probability in roughly 2^((N+1)/2).
	You'll note that the birthday paradox doesn't seem so suprising in
exponential notation. In the case of MD5, with
340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 possible hashes, you get
a 50% chance of a collision in roughly
12,912,720,851,596,686,131 hashes. So that could seem fairly surprising when
you take it out of exponential notation too. (Just compare the lengths of
the two numbers.)
