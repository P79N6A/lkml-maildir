But the start address which is fed into prefetch_range() may not be
cacheline-aligned.  So if appropriately abused, a prefetch_range() could
wander off the end of the user's buffer and into a new page.
I think this gets it right, but I probably screwed something up.
static inline void prefetch_range(void *addr, size_t len)
{
#ifdef ARCH_HAS_PREFETCH
	char *cp;
	unsigned long end;
	end = ((unsigned long)addr + len + PREFETCH_STRIDE - 1);
	end &= ~(PREFETCH_STRIDE - 1);
	for (cp = addr; cp < (char *)end; cp += PREFETCH_STRIDE)
		prefetch(cp);
#endif
}
