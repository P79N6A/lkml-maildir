asm *__volatile__* seems to make no difference.  I've tried a few things.

That does 2 writes with gcc-2.96 and also egcs-2.91.66/19990314
(Red Hat's kgcc), with or without -fstrict-aliasing.
It also does 2 writes without __volatile__.

Sorry, that does just one read, kgcc (old stable gcc) and also with
gcc-2.96.  Type aliasing on/off makes no difference to the number of reads.
Again, __volatile__ makes no difference.
I cannot tell from the GCC manual whether either of these behaviours is
correct or not.
