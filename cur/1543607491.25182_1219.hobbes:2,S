Well, we _are_ going to solve the problem using a firewall between the router
and the local area network.
But the real problem is a different one.
One machine begins an intensive downloading job.  How can this degrade the
network performance even for ICMP packets between another machine and the
router?  Notice that this can't be collitions because the download goes at
64kbps and the local network is 100 Mbps.  Something funny is going on to
stop other people's packets.
Cheers,
Anuradha
