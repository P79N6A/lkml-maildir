There currently isn't a CONFIG_TINY / CONFIG_DESKTOP / CONFIG_FOO.  The
idea is that all of these changes you're working on to make a smaller
kernel shouldn't all be under CONFIG_TINY, but which ones are on / off
are read from some sort of template and there's a default 'tiny'
template, 'desktop' 'foo', etc template which has some on and some off.
And this is a major concern since many of us who would have to deal with
this when it enters the kernel want it to done in a flexible manner
initially, not later on.
