Each acrypto crypto device provides set of capabilities it supports, and
when user requests some operation, acrypto core selects device with the
maximum speed for given capabilities, so one can easily add there GF
multiplication devices. Acrypto supports "sync" mode too in case your
hardware is synchronous (i.e. it does not provide interrupt or other
async event when operation is completed).
P.S. acrypto homepage with some design notes and supported features
can be found here:
