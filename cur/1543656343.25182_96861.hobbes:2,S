Putting the value into memory myself is not possible.  In a DSO I have
to address memory indirectly.  But all registers (except %ebp, and maybe
it'll be used some day) are used at the time of the call.
But there is a way: if I'm using
   #define makesyscall(name) \
        movl $__NR_##name, $eax; \
        call 0xfffff000-__NR_##name($eax)
and you'd put at address 0xfffff000 the address of the entry point the
wrappers wouldn't have any problems finding it.

That's a compilation option.  We might want to do dynamic testing and
yes, a simple pointer indirection is adequate.
But still, the problem is detecting the capable kernels.  You have said
not long ago that comparing kernel versions is wrong.  And I agree.  It
doesn't cover backports and nothing.  But there is a lack of an alternative.
If you don't like the process-global page thingy (anymore) the
alternative would be a sysconf() system call.
