Hello all,
I'm using the matroxfb console and would like to disable the linux logo.
The problem is that the logo messes up scrollback on the first console.
I tried to undefine INCLUDE_LINUX_LOGO but I'm left with undefined
symbols for the logo.
I have now changed 
  fb_setup( ..., init, !init);
to:
  fb_setup( ..., init, 0);
somewhere in fbcon.c
is there a cleaner way to do it ?
I noticed the logo is _initdata, but I would like to not compile it
into the kernel at all.
thanks,
Patrick
