Thanks Con. 
The FW_LOADER option is new. In previous kernels the driver
depended on:
config VIDEO_BT848
tristate "BT848 Video For Linux"
depends on VIDEO_DEV && PCI && I2C && SOUND
I think the FW_LOADER dependency is there by mistake.
So I just edited the drivers/video/Kconfig file and replaced
FW_LOADER with SOUND. Everything is working as expected now.
