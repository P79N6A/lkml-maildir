Woot!  See attached patch and sign-off-by if you want the job. :)
The bit about "the maintainer forwards, not the list" is a suggestion to
prevent duplicates.  It doesn't mean you can't delegate, just that if it's
open season on the list translating stuff _and_ forwarding it, then
linux-kernel will get dupes.  (Plus other maintainers are more likely
to pay attention to somebody they've heard from before.)
Greg KH had entire an OLS presentation about how the developer ->
maintainer -> subsystem -> anderew+linus forwarding is more
an ideal than a reality, but at least it gives us a frame of reference
to diverge from:

+The langauges in which the Linux kernel is developed are C and English.
+(Note that Linus Torvalds' native language is Swedish, yet he chose
+to hold technical discussions in English.)
+
+The job of a language maintainer is to provide a point of contact for
+non-english speaking developers who wish to merge their patches into the
+Linux kernel.  Each language needs a specific language maintainer, who
+accepts non-english patch submissions on behalf of the Linux kernel.
+
+A language maintainer accepts patches to the Linux kernel, written in C, from
+authors who do not also speak English.  The language maintainer translates the
+description of each patch into English, forwards the patches to linux-kernel
+and to the appropriate maintainers for inclusion in the Linux kernel, and
+translates questions and replies about such patches as part of the
+patch review process.
+
+Some language maintainers provide a mailing list as a point of contact, to
+distribute the translation work, but the maintainer is still the person who
+ultimately forwards the results (to prevent duplicates), and the one to contact
+if patches and questions don't get translated and forwarded in a timely fashion.
