Hmm, thanks, when I wrote it in kmail it looked right. two tabs and
then spaces to make it line up with the starting '('.

It may be the most common, but I don't agree that it has the best
readability - but I guess that's very much a subjective thing.

My editor may handle it initially when writing the code, but then it
gets changed and not updated or spaces and tabs end up getting mixed -
like "<tab><tab><space><tab><space>" or something else - it easily
turns into a mess.
Simply using two tabs makes it easy to see that it's not variables in
the function body and is an easy and simple convention to follow (and
IMHO also very readable).
But I guess we'll have to agree to disagree on this.
In any case, thank you for your input.
