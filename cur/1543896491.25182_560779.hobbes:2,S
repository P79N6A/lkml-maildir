Where does this nonsensical idea come from?  How does it follow that,
from FSF offering a licensing option to authors, you conclude that
nobody could ever establish whatever other restrictions they liked?

No, this is not enough to enable someone to adapt the software to
one's own needs.

This would be the copyright author imposing such a restriction, not
the software distributor.

Which is one possible reason to explain why the FSF switched to the
'Installation Information' approach.

Aah, so the software company has designed a mechanism to restrict
users' freedoms, and is just leaving it up to third parties to
complete the implementation?  I think these design documents could be
used in a court to prove intent to impose restrictions on the users,
but IANAL.

Correct.  That's pretty much what I said, isn't it?

It doesn't, and it probably shouldn't.
