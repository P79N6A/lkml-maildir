At the moment Linux is using a number of single-handed clocks.
For anonymous and mapped pages we scan the page tables of the
processes. If the page is stale we evict it _from the page tables_,
but not from memory.
The other hand is scanning physical memory and unmaps stale pages
which don't have any other reference (for example, the virtual
pages we unlinked above).
This gives easy balancing between the different memory usages and
is a cheap and effective 'simulation' of page aging.
