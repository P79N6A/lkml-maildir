It is what is expected. :)
The sym53c8xx provides better support for latest chips but requires the
chip to support LOAD/STORE SCRIPTS instructions. This covers all 53C8XX
chips except 825 rev < 0x10, 810 rev < 0x10 and 815 all revisions.
The ncr53c8xx supports all 53C8XX chips but will not support the 53C1010 
Ultra-160 PCI-SCSI chip. The sym53c8xx will support the C1010 (in fact, 
private version already supports it).
Well... a driver that does not support a chip should just stay silent
about, and this will happen with the {ncr,sym}53c8xx drivers in some
further release. Thanks for having reported these confusing messages.

Sorry, but I am not competent for that one.
