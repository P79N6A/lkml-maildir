Says a man who has a .sig of "SDF Public Access UNIX System -
http://sdf.lonestar.org

Well sdf.lonestar.org claims to be NetBSD so might I suggest your
dangerous ignorance starts at the Unix trademark.
And please take this where it belongs which is the relevant wireless

is not most of the OpenBSD community, nor the Linux kernel team, but a
small group of developers in the OpenBSD wireless world and a few people
in the ath5k GPL project.
