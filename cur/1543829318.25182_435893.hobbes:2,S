What I understand from this is if code is mapped at 0 (eg by mmap(PROT_EXEC)),
it would get executed instead of the program being killed. Although I don't
see how this could be exploited to gain any privileges, I wonder if it can
cause a process to loop indefinitely instead of being killed or nasty things
like this. May be this is a stupid analysis from me, so I hope that PaX Team
will have more precise info.
