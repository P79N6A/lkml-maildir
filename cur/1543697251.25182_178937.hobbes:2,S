Nope. initramfs shares the superblock with 'rootfs', which has the 
MS_NOUSER flags set. Hence graft_tree() (which is the worker function 
for MS_BIND) refuses to work.
Can't we just remove the MS_NOUSER flags if initramfs is active?
Probably not the correct way, but certainly the quickest :-)
The correct way would probably be to clone the superblock of initramfs, 
set the filesystem-type of initramfs to 'ramfs' so that initramfs 
appears to be a chroot()ed filesystem like initrd. Then we could do a 
pivot_root and we have the contents of initramfs still available.
But needs someone with deeper fs-knowledge than myself to do it.
Cheers,
Hannes
