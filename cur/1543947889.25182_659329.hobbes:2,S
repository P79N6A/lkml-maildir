Hi Ingo,
These patches change the fairness model as discussed in
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/30/634
Patch 1 -> Changes the fairness model
Patch 2 -> Allows one to create multiple levels of cgroups
The second patch is not very good with SMP yet, that is the next TODO.
Also it changes the behaviour of fair user. The root task group is the
parent task group and the other users are its children.
Thanks,
