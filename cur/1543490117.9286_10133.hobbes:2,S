It should be EAGAIN, per POSIX 1003.1-1996 section 3.1.1.4:
3.1.1.4 Errors
If any of the following conditions occur, the fork() shall return -1
and set errno to the corresponding value:
[EAGAIN]	The system lacked the necessary resources to create
		another process, or the system-imposed limit on the
		total number of processes under execution by a single
		user would be exceeded.
For each of the following conditions, if the condition is detected,
the fork() shall return -1 and set errno to the corresponding value:
[ENOMEM]	The process requires more space than the system is
		able to supply.
