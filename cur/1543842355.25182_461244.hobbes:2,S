The problem with trying to stop forgery is that there is not yet a 
foolproof or reasonably foolproof method of doing so. All available 
options require cooperation from other MTAs, MUAs, users or 
administrators; hence, they're only good at increasing 'HAM' score.
It is also at least partially unapplicable to LKML since this list 
deliberately allows anyone to post.

Yeah, I whitelist on that address as well. And if someone does respond to 
the challenge (all it takes is reply/send, as I've used a signed VERP as 
the Reply-To), they get whitelisted. If the challenge bounces, it bounces 
to the envelope sender (a different signed VERP) which increases their 
blacklist score by 1. Get a blacklist score of 3 and I'll silently ignore 
your mail for 6 months.
Thanks,
