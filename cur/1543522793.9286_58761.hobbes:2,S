Subject: xmms skipping during window drag/resize operations

Hi folks,
I have a dual CPU PIII-500 running Redhat 6.0, 2.2.12SMP. I am running
MetroX with two Matrox Millenium II cards. Not XFree86 because the official
release doesn't support dual heads just yet.
If I drag/resize a window while xmms is playing an MP3 file, it skips.
I tried everything I could, checking the use Realtime priority box for xmms,
setting it's priority by hand to -20, upping the priority of X to 20.
No matter what I do, the skipping does not go away.
Seems a little strange that a realtime process cannot get all the CPU it
wants on a dual CPU box with nothing else running (except for X).
Is there any bleeding edge kernel patch I can apply to make things better?
Thanks very much!
