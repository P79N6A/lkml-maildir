I've read through the rest of this thread, but it seems to me that the real 
problems are in the basic assumptions you are making that are driving the 
rest of this effort and perhaps we should be examining those assumptions 
instead of your patch.   
For example, from what I've read (particularly Hubertus's post that the pid 
could be in a register), I'm inferring that what you want to do is to be able 
to checkpoint/restart an arbitrary process at an arbitrary time and without 
any special support for checkpoint/restart in that process.   
Also (c. f. Dave Hansen's post on the number of Xen virtual machines 
required),  you appear to think that the number of processes on the system 
for which checkpoint/restart should be enabled is large (more or less the 
same as the number of processes on the system).
Am I reading this correctly?
