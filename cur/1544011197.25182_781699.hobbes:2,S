Subject: [PATCH v6 5/7] sched: activate active load balancing in new idle cpus
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/17/275

Active load balancing is a process by which migration thread
is woken up on the target CPU in order to pull current
running task on another package into this newly idle
package.
This method is already in use with normal load_balance(),
this patch introduces this method to new idle cpus when
sched_mc is set to POWERSAVINGS_BALANCE_WAKEUP.
This logic provides effective consolidation of short running
daemon jobs in a almost idle system
The side effect of this patch may be ping-ponging of tasks
if the system is moderately utilised. May need to adjust the
iterations before triggering.
