It's just so much easier to full the queue with writes than with reads.

No I don't have anything specific, it just seems like a bad heuristic to
get rid of. I can try and do some testing tomorrow. I do feel strongly
that we should at least make sure to reserve a few requests for reads
exclusively, even if you don't agree with the oversized check. Anything
else really contradicts all the io testing we have done the past years
that shows how important it is to get a read in ASAP. And doing that in
the middle of 2.4.22-pre is a mistake imo, if you don't have numbers to
show that it doesn't matter for the quick service of reads.
