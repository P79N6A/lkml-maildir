It's not even decided that the copying version is faster.
I bet for bulk data transfers it isn't faster at all, because instead
of spinning in the unaligned trap handler your spinning swiping the
L2 cache clean with the copies.  I'll take some traps over twice the
data footprint any day, because I can optimize the traps but I can't
make the memory overhead go away.
Also, how much have you optimized your unaligned trap handler?  If it's
a thousand cycles now, do you think you could cut that overhead say
in half?  I bet you could, and then some.  I bet a clever handler could
be done on ia64 or sparc64 in a hundred cycles or so, maybe even faster.
Furthermore, like I said, if you want performance you aren't going
to stick a NS83820 in your box.  Even the author of the driver admits
this and it's not like this chip is the only ~$30USD gigabit chip in
town anymore :)
