Hum... I tracked one missing atomic_set() or ATOMIC_INIT in e1000 driver then.
e1000_alloc_queues() does :
#ifdef CONFIG_E1000_NAPI
         size = sizeof(struct net_device) * adapter->num_queues;
         adapter->polling_netdev = kmalloc(size, GFP_KERNEL);
         if (!adapter->polling_netdev) {
                 kfree(adapter->tx_ring);
                 kfree(adapter->rx_ring);
                 return -ENOMEM;
         }
         memset(adapter->polling_netdev, 0, size);
#endif
So this driver clearly assumes a memset(... 0 ...) also initialize atomic_t to 
  0   ((struct net_device *)->refcnt for example)
