Richard,
Thanks much for posting this.  I admit I have been skipping this entire
thread pretty much :) but the above is worth highlighting.
Unfortunately, while helpful, this doesn't necessarily solve the problem
in Linux; the things that are inlined are quite often fairly "smart"
pieces of code and not just things as simple as wrapper functions, or
structures and typedefs.
Regardless, thanks again to posting the above.
Regards,
	Jeff
