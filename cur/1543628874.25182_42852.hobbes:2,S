	There are really two possibilities:
	1) The two instances are cooperating closely together and should be sharing 
a socket (not each opening one), or
	2) The two instances are not cooperating closely together and each own their 
own socket. For all the kernel knows, they don't even know about each other.
	In the first case, it's logical for whichever one happens to try to read 
first to get the/a datagram. In the second case, it's logical for the kernel 
to pick one and give it all the data.
