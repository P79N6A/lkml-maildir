Except that some controllers are perfectly safe to use both channels
at the same time, except when dealing with rare and sensible operations
(like changing channel settings) where a common set of registers is
shared between channels.
The controller driver in this case will want a lock per channel queue
and an internal lock to protect access to these shared registers. But
that lock can (and has to be) hidden in the controller driver.
