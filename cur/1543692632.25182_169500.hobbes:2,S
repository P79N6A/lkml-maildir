When I wrote the kupdate code, only the real time signals could be
queued. Now things have changed to carry the siginfo for non-RT too. The
fact we clear the pending by hand is what allows more than a RT signal
to be stacked, we shouldn't clear the bitflag unless we dequeue the
signal too. That's definitely a bug (though a minor one ;)
I sure agree it should be fixed with a dequeue_signal in kupdate.
BTW, things like this in daemonize don't protect against allocating
signals (the kernel deamon should flush_signals once in a while in the
main loop to do that):
	/* Block and flush all signals */
	sigfillset(&blocked);
	sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, &blocked, NULL);
	flush_signals(current);
But it's not a big problem you shouldn't send signals to daemons
anyways, only kupdate gives a semantic to signals.
I would suggest you to go ahead and cook the fix ;), thanks.
