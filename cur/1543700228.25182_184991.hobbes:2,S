I'm using a system with 1HD (DC WD600BB-00CAA1 60 GB) using kernel 2.6.0. 
Whenever the system uses the disk extensively (copying a file, untarring, 
etc.), it grinds to a near halt, with the CPU usage at about 100%, even for a 
simple copying operation.
This problem is not present when using 2.4.22, nor any of the 2.4 series 
kernels that I've tried. Does anyone know what is causing this?
Thanks in advance!
