Hi,
I've op'ed a help channel on irc for quite some time (#new*irc*users on
dalnet) but time has been running short so I had to drop that (the
channel is still there, op'ed by some very nice and knowledgeable
people, it's just me who's not there anymore), so your idea appeals to
me a great deal.
On the other hand, I have tried to get linux help on irc channels but I
had to give up; so far the mailing lists (this one is one of the best)
are a better option by far. The problem is, I think, it's hard to get a
big enough team of gurus with time to spare to be available on irc on
something approaching a 24x7 basis. I think that kind of time should be
needed due to people living in different time zones.
It would be nice, tho, to count on a network devoted to supporting all
sorts of products. If you can find a way to get the manpower you need
maybe it'll work.
