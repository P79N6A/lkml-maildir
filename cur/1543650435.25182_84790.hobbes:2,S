It's not personal. He made a wild 'No one needs any of this[initrd]' 
statement. Is he coming from 'this looks like a good idea'(coder) or
'I can prove this is a good idea through experience examples.'
(systems engineer)
I can prove to you (for one thing) that when the shit hits the
fan (disaster recovery) initrd is a good option to have.

The point to this is:
Linking an image into the kernel LOOKS nice, but I would sure not
want to deploy it because it becomes an adminstation nightmare. 
Even with initrd, a single file can be a problem...this is why my
patch supports extracting multiple tar.gz archives....to maintain
configuration modularity.
Having an image in the kernel is not a bad thing...making it the
only option is.
