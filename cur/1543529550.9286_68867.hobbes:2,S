Please excuse this if its a configuration issue:
The IDE drives i have are showing ~4-5MB/sec with hdparm in 2.3.51, they usually
show 19-21 in kernel 2.2.x
cold:~% /sbin/hdparm -c1 -d1 -k1 -m16 -W1 /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
 setting 32-bit I/O support flag to 1
 setting multcount to 16
 setting using_dma to 1 (on)
 HDIO_SET_DMA failed: Operation not permitted
 setting keep_settings to 1 (on)
 setting drive write-caching to 1 (on)
 multcount    = 16 (on)
 I/O support  =  1 (32-bit)
 using_dma    =  0 (off)
 keepsettings =  1 (on)
cold:~% uname -a
