You might be able to have a non-ASCII character that looks
like / but not 0x2f.
I for one do not want open("/var/tpm/diddle", O_WRONLY | O_CREAT)
to create a file "tpm/diddle" in /var just because /var/tpm
doesn't exist.  Fortunately what happens is it fails with
ENOENT.
I expect UTF-8 to have no multi-byte sequences containing NUL
but it might be awkward if a multi-byte sequence contained
0x2F (/).  I would hope that the committees chose to avoid
using symbol and punctuation byte-codes for alphanumeric
sequences.
