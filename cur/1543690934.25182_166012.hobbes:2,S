Using an adapter's ID would be a mistake.  You want to use the media's 
unique ID, assuming it has one.

Not all filesystems have them :)
Further, some sites may prefer block-level GUIDs to fs-level ones. 
Sites using raw partitions instead of filesystems, for one.
We must leave this up to the sysadmin -- within the bounds of technology 
of course.  The sysadmin is out of luck if they purchase a media that 
does not support some sort of labelling or UUID.

You sound like you're agreeing with me ;-)
