Not all users of kernel code are in- or out-of-tree drivers and the
like. E.g. tcsim (from tcng.sf.net) grabs substantial portions of
the traffic control and netlink code and merges them with user
space. It also tries to be compatible with most 2.4 kernels.
For feature tests, I use basically anything that doesn't run away
quickly enough. And I'm sure you want none of *that* kind of code 
anywhere near mainline ;-)
Not that I currently have more troubles with it than usually. I
just want to point out that there are other, strange but legitimate
(at least in the "all shall eventually be GPL" sense) users of the
kernel, who don't mind a friendly environment.
