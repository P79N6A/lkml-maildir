Not sure about "checkbox" thing, the user brings up a window manager
dialog to request a new level.

The "task bar" wasn't a list of tasks, but a stack of security levels.
the stack was nothing but informational, and could not be covered up.
(I suspect that was to prevent spoofing...)

Items 1,2,3 and 6 are all controled by the X server. Items 4 and 5 were
controled by the window manager.

It is the principle of least privelege. If the system is not authorized to
recieve secret data, then you will not be able to set yourself to that level.
If the user does not contain sufficient clearance for a given system, then
that system must not allow a login, even if the user is authorized elsewhere.

Sorry - can't propagate backward. Even via ssh. There is no way for the
remote system to be capable of validating the transition. There just isn't
enough information available (I think it is an unsolvable problem too.).

NOPE. it must fail always - consider Xterm at secret - su to unclassified
(this is invalid because...) cat >copy_of_secret_data; and now paste from
a different secret window into this Xterm - data is passed to su -> cat ->
copy_of_secret_data. This is the violation being blocked.

I see it as background information for when X + Kernel mods begin to support
MAC. What has actually occured is a superficial design for a CMW version
of Linux. Wether this is good or not is opinion.
