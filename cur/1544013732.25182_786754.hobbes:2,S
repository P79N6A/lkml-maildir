Well, I am certainly not the highest-yield developer around, and I have
probably put in at least 30,000 hours of programming over the past 35
years, and probably half of those between 1981 and 1985.  Of course,
a fair fraction of those hours were in languages and environments that
are pretty much irrelevant these days.  Nevertheless, my guess is that
you need to invest about 10,000 hours to really master programming, which
works out to about five years at 40 hours per week of doing nothing but
designing, coding, and debugging.
So please don't give up!

I agree that it would be a nice addition.

I greatly appreciate the fact that you are more interested in the
quality of the Linux kernel than in credit.  That said, I would like the
solution to be something that both you and Manfred agree on.
