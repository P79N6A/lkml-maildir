Hello,
Sorry, maybe i missed something, but according to the
code in fs/sysfs/file.c the "write" sequence is:
- call to sysfs_write_file(ubuf, count)
- if (!sysfsbuf->page)  alloc zeroed page
- copy count bytes from ubuf to sysfsbuf->page
- call store(sysfsbuf->page, count)
When you write again to the file before closing it
(possible?!), and count is less the the previous count
you may not pass a zero terminated string/data to store().
