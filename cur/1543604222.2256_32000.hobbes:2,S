Ah!  Please accept my apologies for belaboring the obvious
in my previous emails.

Such read barriers are not needed on any architecture where
data dependencies imply an rmb().  Examples include i386, PPC,
and IA64.  On these architectures, read-side rmb()s add both
overhead and complexity.
On the completeness, it seems to me that in cases were updates
are rare, the IPIs fill in the gap, and with good performance
benefits.  What am I missing here?
                              Thanx, Paul
