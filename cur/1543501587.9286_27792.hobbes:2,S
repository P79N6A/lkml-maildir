how about: part of the kernel build process involves writing the
current config and compile options into a file[s] within
linux/include?  then as long as the kernel includes are shipped with
a distribution there should be no problem...
the config could be a straight copy of .config (say,
include/linux/kernel.cfg) and make flags could be written into
something like include/linux/kernel_make.cfg.
thoughts?
Cheers,
