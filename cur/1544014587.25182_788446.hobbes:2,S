hm, i think it's cleaner conceptually than trying to wrap this into 
signalfd. Since we already have:
  #define __NR_signalfd           321
  #define __NR_timerfd_create     322
  #define __NR_timerfd_settime    325
  #define __NR_timerfd_gettime    326
  #define __NR_signalfd4          327
is one more really such an issue?
