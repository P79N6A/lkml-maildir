Greetings!  We've just upgraded our internal routers using the Sangoma
wanpipe S508 cards to 2.2.6 recently.  We've merged Alan Cox's wanpipe
patches from 2.2.6ac1, and used the latest wanconfig code from
Sangoma.  The line freezes after a day or two.  We've seemed to find a
work around in pinging the line every minute via cron, and so far, the
router has remained functional for 68 hours.  Is there anything that
can be done to help debug this?  The same hardware setup has been
outrageously stable under 2.0.34.
Thanks!
