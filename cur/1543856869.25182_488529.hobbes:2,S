Almost - except the case about where those skbs are coming from?
It looks like they are obtained from network, since it is ethernet
driver, and if they match some set of rules, they are considered as valid 
MPA negotiation protocol.
If it is correct, it means that any packet in the network can be
potentially 'stolen' by rdma hardware, although it was part of the usual
dataflow. 
If that packets are not from ethernet network, but from different
low-level, then there is a question (besides why this driver is called
ethernet if it manages different hardware) about how connection over
that different media is being setup and since packets contain perfectly
valid IP addresses and ports.
And, btw, not related question - does postponing the whole skb multiplexing 
to work queue result in lower latency and/or higher speed?
Since there are a lot of tricks introduced to minimize gap between
interrupt/napi polling and protocol processing, so such huge postponing
with the whole context switch looks strange.
