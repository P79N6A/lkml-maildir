"noapic" didn't work, nor did "noacpi", etc.
Going to 2.6.13-rc6.2 solved the problem (once I integrated udev, etc.).
The chipset is an Intel 8x0 something.  Unfortunately, there is a 
heatsink semi-permanently installed over everything.  Is there a /proc 
pseudofile that will give me good identifying chipset info to report here?
If there is a FAQ for this, we should post a message about it once in a 
while.
Nothing here indicates chipset:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/docs/lkml/reporting-bugs.html
The CPU is an Intel Celeron CPU 2.00GHz running at 1495.772 MHz, 128MB 
cache.
