I think the design is OK.  It's for "misc stuff".  There's only
a single instance, it's only lightly used.

Pretty much every use of keventd make sense as-is, IMO.

We need process context for starting a thread...
It's just an 8k stack.  I believe that keventd is OK, as
long as people don't go nuts when using it.   It may make
some sense to overload ksoftirqd to provide keventd functionality.
Except ksoftirqd runs at super-low priority, which is exactly
what keventd doesn't want.
