Might not be, try turning off modversions.  I have an es1370 (sbpci64) and
an sb16(vibra).  I'm just guessing on this, but I've never had a problem
with modular sound except back in the 2.2.0-pre days (alan cox should
remember that one <g>)
Here's my list:
sb                     31808   1  (autoclean)
uart401                 5644   1  (autoclean) [sb]
es1370                 23836   1  (autoclean)
sound                  55532   0  (autoclean) [sb uart401]
soundcore               2260   9  (autoclean) [sb es1370 sound]
Here's relevent in modules.conf
# Sound Card Support
# es1370 card
alias sound-slot-0 es1370
alias sound-slot-1 es1370
alias sound-service-0-0 es1370
alias sound-service-0-3 sb
# SB16 ViBRA card

alias sound-service-1-0 sb
alias synth0 adlib_card
options sb irq=7 io=0x220 dma=1 dma16=5
options sound dmabuf=1
options adlib_card io=0x388
# Makes things load in the right order =)
pre-install sb modprobe -s -k es1370

This is to the entire list (and this is just to satisfy a curiosity!):
Say I have 2 soundcards (Ok, so I do, but <g>) that are the same type (like
an sb32 and an sb16).
Assume that:
sb32 irq=7 iobase=0x220 dma=1 dma16=5
and
sb16 irq=5 iobase=0x240 dma=2 dma16=3
Ok, how do I get sb.o to use both cards, or would I do something like copy
the module to another name and use that?
I had this senerio working under 2.0 with a sb16 and an sbpro.
