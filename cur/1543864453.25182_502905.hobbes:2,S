I see the same symptoms on my Intel Mac Mini, and reverting the commit
also allows the driver to seemingly resume correctly. 
However after coming out of sleep I need to reconfigure the network
interface. No need to rmmod/insmod, just ifdown/ifup is sufficient (but
of course shouldn't be necessary, should it?). If I don't reconfigure
it, ping from/to the box will work, but nothing more complicated like
ssh will go through.
Fred.
