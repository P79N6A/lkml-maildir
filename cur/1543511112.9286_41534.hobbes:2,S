Forgive off-topic-ness, but what's with this magic.metawire.com ?
It broke my normal filtering, and I got a load of these messages
in my inbox.
What's wrong with using vger like everyone else does?
This isn't intended as a flame, I just don't like having to create
extra mail filtering rules without good reason.
regards,
Dave.
