Actually, I'd be very sceptical that the blk_queue_bounce_limit isn't
working as advertised; there'd be a large number of failures if it were
not.
However, the "as advertised" part doesn't seem to be generally well
understood.  The point being that block commands are only bounced if
they come from the filesystem or the user, not if they're generated
directly inside the kernel.  Since the fault occurs before mount, it's
suggestive of the latter.
A long time ago, GFP_KERNEL allocations meant that the memory allocated
was physically under 4GB.  Then x86_64 (and before it ia64) wanted to
break this.  So they introduced a new flag:  GFP_DMA32 that behaved like
the old GFP_KERNEL and then changed GFP_KERNEL on their architectures to
return memory from anywhere.  I'd strongly suggest some piece of kernel
memory was allocated for a transfer buffer without GFP_DMA32 and then
passed in to the driver.  Unfortunately, that could be anywhere inside
cdrom or sr.  Knowing what the actual command is might help ... some of
the distinctive MMC media ones only have a single source.
