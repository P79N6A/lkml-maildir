You don't need any additional modules. Just don't activate ide-scsi by
either not appending ide-scsi/scsi=hdX or not compiling ide-scsi
support in the kernel. 
You also need a recent version of cdrtools. Just take the latest
cdrtools-2.0pre version. cdrdao won't work yet without moving the new
libscg from cdrtools to cdrdao, but it's not too hard to do and if you
complain on the cdrdao list they will perhaps update it themselves
sooner ;-)
After that is done you can burn your disks with dev=/dev/hdX.

Markus
