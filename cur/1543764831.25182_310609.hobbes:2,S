is there any fundamental problem with going with v2 right now, and then 
once v3 is out and assuming it looks ok, all newly copyrightable bits 
(new files, rewrites, substantial contributions, etc.) get a v3 
copyright? (and the collection itself would be v3 too) That method 
wouldnt make it fully v3 automatically once v3 is out, but with time 
there would be enough v3 bits in it to make it essentially v3. This way 
we wouldnt have to blanket trust v3 before having seen it, and wouldnt 
be stuck at v2 either.
