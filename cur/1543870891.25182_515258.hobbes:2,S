Only preliminary other benchmarking has been done so far on RSDL, and so far 
the results are equal to or slightly better than mainline on scalability 
grounds.
These are the sysbench graphs just for completion that Nishanth Aravamudan 
performed. We were actually trying to track down the cause of the mysql 
performance problem and I suggested trying different cpu schedulers as well. 
Needless to say I'm not unhappy with the results although they haven't told 
us exactly where the problem lies but it certainly does add evidence that 
perhaps it is a scheduling issue.
