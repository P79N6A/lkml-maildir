I wonder if problems are due to my VIA PCI chipset?  Here are some details:
  Bus  0, device  10, function  0:
    SCSI storage controller: Adaptec AIC-7892A U160/m (rev 2).
      IRQ 12.
      Master Capable.  Latency=32.  Min Gnt=40.Max Lat=25.
      I/O at 0xa800 [0xa8ff].
      Non-prefetchable 64 bit memory at 0xdf000000 [0xdf000fff].
  Bus  0, device   0, function  0:
    Host bridge: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82C693A/694x [Apollo PRO133x] (rev 196).
      Prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xe7000000 [0xe7ffffff].
  Bus  0, device   1, function  0:
    PCI bridge: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82C598/694x [Apollo MVP3/Pro133x AGP] (rev 0).
      Master Capable.  No bursts.  Min Gnt=8.
