This is fine with me.  I debated between printing nothing and a "You
have chosen to override ..." print but didn't come out with any
opinion.  I'm easy either way.
The indenting in the "if (!force_function_unhide && !(stat8 & (1 << 5)))
{" clause is kind of strange and you have some spaces instead of tabs
right after that (where stat8 is set).
Thanks again,
