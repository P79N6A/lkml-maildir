I realized last night what the problem must be.  It's extremely obvious in 
retrospect, but I happen to have a blind spot in this particular area.
All you guys must have CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND turned off.  Mattis certainly 
does; I checked his .config.  Now I hardly ever do any testing without 
CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND, since there's not much point working on power 
management code if your kernel isn't set up to actually suspend devices.
As a result I missed seeing the problems caused by the autosuspend 
changes.
Now of course, the autosuspend stuff has to work properly no matter what 
the kernel configuration is.  I'll go back and rebuild the drivers with 
USB_SUSPEND turned off and see what happens.  With any luck I'll have a 
fix ready in the near future.
