Kyle claims he can emulate SMACK with SELinux + perl script, but I
don't think it is fair to force him to write that perl. You want the
code merged, so it should be up to you to do the work... or
acknowledge that selinux ineed is smack supperset and argue that SMACK
is better, anyway, because of its simplicity / speed / something.
Or maybe that perl script is impossible to write for some reason? Tell
us if so...
