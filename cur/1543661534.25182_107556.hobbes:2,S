The GPL only requires that source accompanies any distributed binaries.
In other words, with distribution comes the requirement of source. 
MontaVista provides all the source to all GPL components as part of
their products.
The GPL places no requirement on giving source away to the world at
large, which would be silly. If you do not distribute anything, you do
not have to make available the source. If you do, you need to give the
recipients the source as well.
That line is in the FAQ because many customers are concerned of their
obligations with GPL software.
