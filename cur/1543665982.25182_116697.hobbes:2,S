When building microcode support for i386 PIII as a module, I get an
unresolved 
reference to devfs_set_file_size.  Attached is a patch to fs/devfs/base.c 
that fixes the problem.
Being a newbie, I don't know if that is the appropriate fix, or if devfs
should be tweeked instead.
Using devfs, on 2.5.64, bk4
