Yes if the user/group names are available (as in 9P), then doing the
mapping based on /etc/passwd for example makes sense.
But sshfs only transfers the numeric uid/gid, and hence there's simply
no info to base any transformation on.
It could transfer /etc/passwd from the remote server, and use that to
do mapping, but that is getting more complex than the problem actually
warrants IMO.
