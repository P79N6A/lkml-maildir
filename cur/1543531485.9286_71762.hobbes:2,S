Hi,
New release of the packet writing module for ATAPI and SCSI CD-RW
units. Get it here:
ftp://ftp
.*.kernel.org/pub/linux/people/axboe/packet/packet-0.0.1l-2.3.99-pre3-8.tar.bz2
The diff is currently against 2.3.99-pre3-8. Important changes in
this release:
	- Fix nasty bug where multiple writes would not get stored
	  in the correct order when requeued
	- Fix SCSI segment miscount. SCSI has too many rules that
	  pktcdvd should not know about, so let it recount
	- Elevator nr_segment better, but not perfect. Minor
	  problem
	- Fixed sr as builtin bug, thanks to Arnd Bergmann <arnd@itreff.de>
	- New PACKET_READONLY flag to catch writes on ro media,
	  originally because of UDF problem
	- Made pkt_recheck_segments standard
	- Made pkt_queue_request "nicer" wrt elevator
	- Try to detect cases where we are loosing performance
	  on duplicated writes. Hasn't caught anything yet...
	- Update udf-0.9.1 to be aware of CDROM_SEND_PACKET changes
	- Ported to pre-2.3.99-pre3-8
