No, it's not. On x86-64 it can be three or more stacks nested in
complicated ways (process stack, interrupt stack, exception stack)
The exception stack can happen multiple times.

It has pretty good sanity checking by first using __get_user for the stack
data, and the regularly double checking the EIPs by looking them up
in CFI. If it can't find them it will abort.

In this particular case what happened is that the dwarf2 unwinder
ended and then the fallback was in the wrong page and couldn't handle 
it.

That was before interrupt stacks were introduced. With that it is significantly
more complicated. On x86-64 even more because there are exception stacks.
