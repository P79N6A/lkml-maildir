Not everyone. S-u is not a subset of journalling and IMNSHO it's way
cleaner. Kirk's code can't be directly ported - too different VFS behind
it, but the concept is sound and well-explored (thanks to Kirk). It can be
implemented right now, but I hate to introduce the third patch with large
VM changes - 3-way merge (VM parts of s-u/ext3/reiserfs) will suck rocks
through the straw. Let's wait until VM infrastructure will be in place.
