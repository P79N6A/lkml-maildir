Hey Magnus,
I see what you are doing and why. However if you look in 
arch/x86_64/kernel/setup.c, you'll see
         parse_early_param();
         finish_e820_parsing();
         e820_register_active_regions(0, 0, -1UL);
If you just called e820_register_active_regions(0, 0, -1UL) before 
parse_early_param(), would it still fix the problem without having to call 
e820_register_active_regions(0, 0, -1UL) twice?
