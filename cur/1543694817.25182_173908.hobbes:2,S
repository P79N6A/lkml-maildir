There was no attached code when I received your email.
If the stuff above is 'sample code', then I don't know what
kind of compiler you are using because, at the very least, there
should be some curley-braces and an entry point. So, I made
some sample code. Could you please try it and tell us what
it does that is unexpected?
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <setjmp.h>
#include <signal.h>
int function(int input, const char *cp) {
    return fprintf(stderr, cp, input);
}
jmp_buf env;
int (*funct)(int, const char *) = NULL;
void SignalHdl(int sig) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Signal received %d\n", sig);
    longjmp(env, sig);
}
int main() {
    int result;
    int times = 5;
    (void)signal(SIGSEGV, SignalHdl);
    (void)signal(SIGBUS,  SignalHdl);
    if(!setjmp(env)) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Started\n");
        result = funct(times, "Handler writes %d\n");
    }
    if(times--) {
        funct = function;
        fprintf(stderr, "Okay(%d)\n", times);
        result = funct(times, "Handler writes %d\n");
        fprintf(stderr, "Okay(%d)\n", times);
        funct = NULL;
        result = funct(1, "Handler writes %d\n");  // Segfault
    }
    return 0;
}
It all seems to work here with Linux-2.4.22, even though the
counter "times" really should not be relied upon after the
longjmp.
