I think this is not actually module loading itself, but a problem
between the fork/exec/wait code in nash and the kernel. The
commands which have problems are the ones which are not built
into nash. So this looks more like a problem with wait. This
would explain sleep fixing it and the fact that I have device
issues after module load.
