This updated patch seems to work just fine on my machine with lapic on
the cmdline and CONFIG_DYN_TICK_USE_APIC disabled.
Also, you were correct that removing lapic from the cmdline allowed the
previous version to run at full speed.
Now, how can I tell if the patch is doing its thing?  What should I be
seeing? :)
Functionally, it looks like it's working.  There were a number of
compiler warnings you might wish to fix before calling it good.  Such as
"initialization from incompatible pointer type" several times in
dyn-tick-timer.c and a "too many arguments for format" in
dyn_tick_late_init.
