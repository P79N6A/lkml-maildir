There is a chicken-and-egg problem here then.
Let's fix it.
I maintain the sysctl program, which most Linux
distributions run at boot. I agree to switch to the
binary sysctl interface if somebody will maintain
the kernel side of things. This will shave a bit of
time off boot on nearly every Linux box out there.
The total time saved is probably a human lifetime,
so it's like saving somebody's life.

Eh? A factor of two is not "in the noise".

That is still a horrible way to piss away performance.

I have more experience with /proc. There, ASCII is
known to be a problem.
Parsing a 64-bit number is horribly slow on i386.
Matching keywords, as is needed for /proc/*/status,
is also horribly slow. I ended up using gperf to make
a perfect hash table, then gcc's computed goto for
jumping to the code, and it still wasn't cheap to do.
(while /sys lacks this, the extra open-read-close is
certain to be far worse)
