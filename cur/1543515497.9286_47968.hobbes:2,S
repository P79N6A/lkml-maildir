It is pretty easy to overflow it. You should generate more than
2048 requests per arp resolution timeout (1sec) to dead hosts.
If you did this that time, then you achieved exactly the effect,
which you expected. 8) No extensions will help here, you hit natural
limit and the further increasing arp table size will result in complete
congestion of ethernet with broadcast ARPs.
