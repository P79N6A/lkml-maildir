I probably did not cut enough details - my main position is to allocate
per socket reserve from socket's queue, and copy data there from main
reserve, all of which are allocated either in advance (global one) or
per sockoption, so that there would be no fairness issues what to mark 
as special and what to not.
Say we have a page per socket, each socket can assign a reserve for
itself from own memory, this accounts both tx and rx side. Tx is not
interesting, it is simple, rx has global reserve (always allocated on 
startup or sometime way before reclaim/oom)where data is originally 
received (including skb, shared info and whatever is needed, page is 
just an exmaple), then it is copied into per-socket reserve and reused 
for the next packet. Having per-socket reserve allows to have progress 
in any situation not only in cases where single action must be 
received/processed, and allows to be completely fair for all users, but
not only special sockets, thus admin for example would be allowed to
login, ipsec would work and so on...
