But is it valuable? Compared to a waste of sizeof(struct super_block)
bytes memory.
When some code want to refer fs_type->s_op, it almost always want to
refer some function pointer in s_op with fs_type->s_op->***, but all
pointers in default_op are all NULLs, what about this scenario?
and if you do grep s_op in the source code, you will found nowhere
will want to test s_op or dependent on s_op not NULL.
So my opinion is to remove default_ops, just keep new allocated s_op NULL.
