Everyone cares about that! That has nothing to do with performance. It's 
simply a broken compiler which needs fixing.

Thanks for the warning. I will keep an eye out for eventual "NTFS is broken 
with gcc-2.95 reports"... Although I would make that gcc-2.96 and not 3.0 
as minimum requirement. At least I haven't found anything wrong with the 
current gcc-2.96...
(Please let's not start another flamewar about whether gcc-2.96 exists or not.)
Best regards,
