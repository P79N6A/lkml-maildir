The name of this patch is really "split ACPI function tracing
out of CONFIG_ACPI_DEBUG to a new Kconfig build option"
I agree that tracing should be its own build option.
I don't agree that enabling CONFIG_ACPI_DEBUG by default
is what you want to do in a production kernel, but that
isn't what this patch does, and I'm not going to stand
in your way if you want to ship debug kernels by default.

There are two types of "ACPI tables", those with contents defined by
the ACPI spec, and those where ACPI is just acting as the "envelope"
to deliver a table from another spec to the OS.
We already use all the tables defined by the ACPI spec.
It is unlikely that this patch will have any effect on the "envelope" tables.
So I don't think you're going to see growing utility of CONFIG_ACPI_DEBUG
over time, you're going to see what it does immediately.

I agree that function tracing is never used by people who can't build a kernel --
and so it is fine to make it an additional build option.

37% sounds like a lot.
The ACPI interpreter is not supposed to be in performace critical sections,
but at the same time, it isn't supposed to be a pig either.

.22 after -rc3?  No.  I don't see a problem with a final version
shipping in .23, however.

It would be better for andrew to get it through acpi-test.
I'll be happy to include an updated version of this patch there.
Note that the testing that it is going to get will be small:
1. people who don't enable CONFIG_ACPI_DEBUG
	no change
2. people who enable CONFIG_ACPI_DEBUG
	will lose function tracing if they don't ask for it
	will lose AML Debug-object messages unless they
		set the flag to get them back.

This, is an incompatible change, as one of the benefits of
CONFIG_ACPI_DEBUG is to get the AML debug-object messages.
After this patch, those will silently go away.
The patch needs to document the boot-time flag to make
those messages come back.

help text needs update -- it should say what tracing does,
not if SuSE customers frequently use it or not...

These non-defines already appear later in the file.
Perhaps you can use an expression to make them appear just once instead of twice?
