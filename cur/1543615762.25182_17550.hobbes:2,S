I've made a new patch for visws support for 2.4.17 availble at sf.net.
It's really just a cleaned up (by no means fully cleaned up, however)
version of the last one.  Don't forget to pass 'mem=xxxM' (where xxx
is the number of megs of RAM on your machine) on the boot line, since
the kernel will only see 128M otherwise.  It's available at the
SourceForge project page (
http://sf.net/projects/linux-visws
).
Comments and questions welcome.
Thanks,
Jesse
