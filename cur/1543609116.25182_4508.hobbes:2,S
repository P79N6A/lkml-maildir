Yeah, using VMware build 1455 on ABit BP-6 with 2 * Celeron 466@466, 768 MB RAM
(dirt cheap nowadays so why not...), 2 * Maxtor 40GB IDE on BX controller, HPT
controller not in use, Matrox G400. I've seen the rtc: blah errors, stressed
the box to its limits with VM's with Linux/WinXP, and every now and then...
it just freezes... (only when using a Linus kernel, and only when using VMware)
I'll try 2.4.15pre, maybe it helps...
Cheers//Frank
