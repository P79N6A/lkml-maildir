Hi all,
It's pretty much painfully obvious that I'm way behind in editing the
Linux Device List, although I *have* processed registrations.
However, a major reason for this delay is that way back when I got
convinced to maintain both a text and a TeX version of this file,
which has meant double work for everything.
This doesn't scale very well, and besides, I really would like to have
something output HTML as well.  Therefore, unless I hear *loud*
protests in the next few days, I'm planning on killing off devices.tex
until I have found (and had time to convert to) a decent single-source
format.
Ok?
