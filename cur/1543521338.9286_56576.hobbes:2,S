Thanks for all the info. USB is now working with 2.3.38.
My FM tuner still isn't very happy though. I have tried loading msp3400
after bttv:
Linux video capture interface: v1.00

1).
Now I find that I can adjust the tuning to one particular station ( and
one only ) and the frequency that kradio and radio tell me it is tuned
to isn't the frequency I know this station transmits on. Again, going
back to a kernel with the older driver makes everything work normally.
Something very odd is going on. Has the interface that applications use
to set the tuner changed in any way?
 Alastair.
