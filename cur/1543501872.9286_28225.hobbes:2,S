There's another obvious example of a document that is often
represented as a group of files collected in a directory -- a web
page.  Admittedly there's nothing that requires web page authors
to collect all the files related to a page into a single
directory, but it's often the obvious solution and one that is
easily handled even by technically unsophisticated people.  And
Albert can't claim that HTML authors are some rare fringe group
like TeX users.
