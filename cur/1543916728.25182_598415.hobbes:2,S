Subject: [PATCH 1/3] Virtualization config cleanup: Select CONFIG_PARAVIRT when required
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/24/498

(Unless there are complaints, I'll push this as part of the lguest
patches for 2.6.24, since there are lguest config changes there too).
Andi points out that PARAVIRT is an option best selected when needed.
We introduce PARAVIRT_GUEST for the menu itself, and select PARAVIRT
if the user turns on anything which needs it.
