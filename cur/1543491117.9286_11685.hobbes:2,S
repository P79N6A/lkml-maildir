Hi all,
    I just upgraded my kernel from 2.0.36 to 2.2.4 and all works smooth,
except ircd wont run anymore. I dont get any messages, it just dies quietly
immediately after it is started. The only thing i can find is the following
line in /var/log/messages:
Mar 27 05:54:24 cralin01 ircd[1437]: binding stream socket
zwijndrecht.nl.eu.dreamnet.org: Address already in use
I tried using netstat -an to see if there are any suspicious ports/streams
in use, but there aren't. On 2.0.36 it runs smoothly, but it doesnt want to
work on 2.2.4. I tried recompiling it, no good. Tried a different machine
(also 2.2.4), no good either, same thing.
Does anyone have ideas how solve this or know where i might look? Its pretty
urgent to me, cause obviously i dont want to be down too long. :-)
Thanks,
-AB-
