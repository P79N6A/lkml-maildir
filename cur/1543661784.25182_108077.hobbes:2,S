OK.  Looks like Linus is hot on the trail.
BTW, some nice people have been sending in smalldevfs testing results
(successful).  I've put that patch back up at
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/2.5/2.5.59/smalldevfs.patch
for other testers.  It applies to 2.5.59 base.
And it is not clear why I copied Ingo on the signal thing, when it is not he
who is working that code.  Sorry about that.
