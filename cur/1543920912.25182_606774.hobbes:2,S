Hi Andrew,
Takenori wants to make kdb and kdump co-exist. Currently after panic()
panic_notifier_list is not executed if kdump is configured. Before list
is executed, system will boot into second kernel to capture the dump. Hence
if even if kdb was registered on panic_notifier_list, it will never get
a chance to run.
One of the ideas was to put all the RAS tools on panic_notifier_list, export
the list to user space and let user determine the order in which these
should be called. That's why this patchset is there.
This does bring in some reliability concerns for kdump as now there is
additional dependency on notifier infrastructure after panic.
Eric, had suggested that kdb can put a break point on panic() to handle
the co-existence issue and no need to bring in additional dependencies in
panic path.
I agree with the idea of kdb putting a break point in panic. If there are
more tools down the line who run into co-existence issue with kdump, then
we can re-visit this idea.
Thanks
Vivek
