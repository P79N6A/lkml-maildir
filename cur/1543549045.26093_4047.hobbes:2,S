Yes, 2.4 has 32bit uid/gid support.  No, 2.2 doesn't, but there is a patch
from 
http://www.engin.umich.edu/caen/systems/Linux.
  You'll probably have
to do some work to fit the patches into the latest 2.2 kernels though, as
they're no longer being maintained in leu of 2.4.
In addition to running a 2.4 kernel, you'll also need to hack up glibc to
recognize the new syscalls the kernel provides for 32bit uid/gid support.
It's claimed that glibc 2.2 will have this, but you'll have to wait until 
it is released.  I hacked 2.1.3 with satisfactory results.
If you use quotacheck from quota-x.x.tar.gz and you enable the direct ext2
support stuff, you'll have to hack it up to properly reassemble uids/gids.  
The same applies to debugfs from e2progs-x.y.tar.gz, and any other utility
which accesses the ext2 filesystem directly - as opposed to using standard
filesystem routines.
If you're interested in process accounting, be aware that the accounting
file format is still mired with 16bit uids/gids.  Fortunately this one is
trivial to fix, as long as you don't mind abandoning your old accounting
files.  I think the 2.2->2.4 transition would be a great time to make the
switch, officially.
Be aware that other utilities that deal with uids/gids may break.  Tar is
one of them.  The tar format specifies 16bit uids/gids.  Patching tar may
not be wise if you're going to share the tarballs with other systems. ELF
core files also suffers this problem.  I'm sure I left out others.
