Hi Adrian
Is there a valid reason why you removed most of the
descriptions ? I think a bit of a background on the
CPU selections is helpful and interesting, especially 
for newcommers. You've cut it down so far, that you 
could also put there "Read Variable Name" or 
"No help available"  instead.
Cheers
