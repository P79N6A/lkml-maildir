Benoit - 
Thank you for the response - I think that you are correct in your analysis that the probem has something to do with timing and not with EXT3 itself.  
However, I have been thinking this through and this cold little shadow is now hanging over my head - there was a difference in the process used to build the system between 2.6.22.1 and 2.6.23-rcx and I would like to account for it before anyone burns their valuable time chasing ghosts I may have created.,
Specifically I am refering to the process I used ot build the initrd image.
Traditionally, I used the old standby mkinitrd whcih still builds a useable image.  However, when tracking down a series of messages about a failure to mount devfs devices I discovered that the approved method is now to use mkinitramfs.
And mkinitramfs did eliminate the messages about devfs just as the documentation said it would.
However, the initrd image for my 2.6.22.1 was built using the older mkinitrd command and it DOES NOT seem to have the timestamp issue buring boot.  With the 2.23.6-rcx series of kernels I used the mkinitramfs process - and my 2.6.23-rcx kernels is where I am seeing the problem.
I am at work now and don't have a way of seeing the early boot messages on my system at home.  When I get home this afternoon I will build the initrd image for the 2.6.22.1 system using the mkinitramfs command and I will post an updated status at that time.
