Subject: WRT SIGURG incorrectly delivered to process

On, or about, April 18, Christopher Yeoh fixed a problem in the
v2.4-kernel where SIGURG got terminated incorrectly, in violation to
SuSv3. I intend to merge this fix into v2.0 as well, unless someone has
any objections.
However, I noticed that kernel/signal.c also contains similar code that
does not contain SIGURG (mangled whitespace):
(on line 1112 or thereabouts)
  if (k->sa.sa_handler == SIG_IGN
                    || (k->sa.sa_handler == SIG_DFL
                        && (sig == SIGCONT ||
                            sig == SIGCHLD ||
                            sig == SIGWINCH))) {
                        spin_lock_irq(&current->sigmask_lock);
                        if (rm_sig_from_queue(sig, current))
                                recalc_sigpending(current);
                        spin_unlock_irq(&current->sigmask_lock);
                }
Is this intentionally left this way, or did it get missed out by
mistake?!
