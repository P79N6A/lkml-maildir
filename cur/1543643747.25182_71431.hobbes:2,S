You forget - I'm not only a smarty, I'm sick and twisted too.

We have a simple rule:
 - task->lock_depth = -1 means "no lock held"
 - task->lock_depth >= 0 means "BKL really held"
... but what does "task->lock_depth < -1" mean?
Yup: "validly nonpreemptable".
So then you have:
	#define kernel_locked()	(current->lock_depth >= 0)
	#define in_atomic() (preempt_count() & ~PREEMPT_ACTIVE) != (current->lock_depth != -1))
and you're all set - just set lock_depth to -2 when you exit to show that
you don't hold the BKL, but that you are validly not preemtable.
I get the award for having the most disgusting ideas.
