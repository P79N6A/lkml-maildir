Please note that the code in question present currently there is
quite frankly not functional. And that's the main problem
with it - It's hard to guarantee proper functionality of
the mail functionality if there is something "catching it's eggs
from behind". Please note further that the excessive copying between
a variable called frequently args and the "task file"
register set just shows that the API the ide-taskfile is trying
to implement is not right. Further on the excessive command format
validation found in ide-taskfile.c is just too much of a burden.
