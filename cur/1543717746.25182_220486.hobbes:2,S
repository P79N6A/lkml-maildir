Now that I'm considering it all, I think serio->interrupt function
should indeed be called within an interrupt context. The name should be
a big enough warning not to do too much processing (and definitely no
communication with the device other than doing something with the
received byte) there.
The input core and the handlers were intended to be lightweight enough
so that they could be executed from an interrupt handler as well.
Are we really spending too much time in the interrupt there? It's well
possible, but it'd be good if it could be evaluated. It should be rather
easy to add a rdtsc before an after the invocation of serio->interrupt
from i8042.c.
That should give us the answer about what to do - which parts of the
input processing can stay in the interrupt (because that is simple), and
what needs to be postponed to a tasklet or schedule_work().
Each of your options seems reasonable. I think moving keyboard.c to
schedule_work is a definitely good idea, but we may want to do more than
that.
