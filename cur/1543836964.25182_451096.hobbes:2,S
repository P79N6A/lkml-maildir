Yes, and a high value will waste a lot of memory for normal users.

If we move it into vmalloc space it would be easy to extend at runtime - just the
virtual address space would need to be prereserved, but then more pages
could be mapped. Maybe we should just do that instead of continuing to kludge around?
Drawback would be some more TLB misses.
