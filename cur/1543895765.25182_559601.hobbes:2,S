Having all-in-one patchset, like -mm is easy thing to provide
interested parties with "you know what you have -- crazy development"
However [P]TS is tracking, recording, organizing tool. {1} Andrew's cron
daemon easily can run script to check status of particular patch (cc,
tested-by, acked-by). If patch have no TS ID, Andrew's watchdog is
barking back to patch originator (with polite asking to send patch as:
* TS as "To:" target
* patch author as "Cc:" target, this is useful to require:
  . author can check that copy himself with text-only pager program
    (to see any MIME coding crap)
  . preventing SPAM
* maybe somebody else in Cc or Bcc.)

Crazy development{0}. Somebody knows, that comprehensively testing
hibernation is their thing. I don't care about it, i care about foo, bar.
Thus i can apply for example lguest patches and implement and test new
asm-offset replacement, *easily*. Somebody, as you know, likes new fancy
file system, and no-way other. Let them be happy testing that thing
*easily*. Because another fancy NO_MHz will hang their testing bench
right after best ever speed results were recorded.

Linus' watchdog, as well, asking for valid patch id, or just doesn't
care (in similar manner Linus does :).
So far no human is involved in social things. Do you agree?
Human power is worth and needed in particular patch discussion and
testing under the participation (by Cc, acking, test-ok *e-mails*) of
tracking system.

I tried to test that new fancy FS, and couldn't boot because of
yet-another ACPI crap. See theme{0}?
Overall testing, like Andrew does, is doubtless brave thing, but he have
more time after {1}, isn't it?

Tracking all possible testers (for next driver update, for example) is
in question.

I might be stupid, but i faced it. On my amd64 512M laptop i *cannot* run
mozillka any more, for example! And i don't care, because Linus said his
opinion and i fully agree with him.

Awesome!!! Are you wrote this reply to me by

web interface? If you did .........</dev/random dd bs=1 count=13.....
Actually you didn't ;)

As you just might have seen here, i was talking about organizing,
tracking, hopefully saving and redirecting useful main power. And i don't
bother search e-mails i saw about Bugzilla's BD from many other prominent
developers. I just know that, not from my dream or physical vacuum.
Basic concept of Debian BTS is what i've discovered after many useless
hours i spent in Bugzilla. And this is mainly because of one basic
important thing, that nobody acknowledged (for newbies, like me):
* E-Mail with useful MUAs, after it got reliable delivery MTAs with qmail
  (or exim) is the main communication toolset.
Can't you see that from Linux's patch sending policy?
I also what to reply to myself about why LKML was established and
USENET (news) was abandoned.
To control and to keep running *your* _main communication toolset_
(read as "your user,developer feedback").
I just couldn't realize that, because i grew up in free web e-mail, after
having set up my own server with MTA and real e-mail and after
discovering Gmane (really mind-blowing evolution of the e-mail system!)
