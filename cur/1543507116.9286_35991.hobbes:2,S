I noticed this problem with 2.2.10, but it seems to have gotton
worst.
I also noticed that the following is getting written to my log
files something like: (if you need the exact message I can send
that to you, but I am not on that computer right now)
 ppp<->modem connect
could not load requested module ppp-compress-21 
could not load requested moduleppp-compress-26
could not load requested moduleppp-compress-24 
then the IP addresses show here 207.x.x.x
I traced this and believe it is being generated in the funciton
ppp_set_compression (drivers/net)
I think it is most likely in the #ifdef's 
#ifdef CONFIG_KMOD
         if (cp == NULL) {
                 char modname[32];
                 sprintf(modname, ppp-compress-%d",
ccp_option[0]);
                 request_module(modname);
                 cp = find_compressor(ccp_option[0]);
         }
 #endif /* CONFIG_KMOD */
if (cp == NULL) {
                 if (ppp->flags & SC_DEBUG)
                         printk(KERN_DEBUG
                                "%s: no compressor for [%x %x
%x], %x\n",
                                ppp->name, ccp_option[0],
ccp_option[1],
                                ccp_option[2], nb);
                 goto out;               /* compressor not
loaded */
         }
can someone tell me what this means. In particular the
ppp-compress-21,  ppp-compress-24 and ppp-compress-26, 
Where does it get this info?  
Joe
