I was wondering if it would be sufficient to provide alternative
versions of fb_readl, fb_writel etc. that do byte-swapping.  That
would mean that all framebuffers would have to have the same
endianness, but that would suffice for embedded systems such as
Anton's and would end up a lot simpler IMHO.
