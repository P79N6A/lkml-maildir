I thought Hubertus did talk about this when the last time the thread
was active. Anyways, Here is how one could do cpuset/memset under the
ckrm framework(Note that I am not pitching for a marriage :) as there are 
some small problems, like supporting 128 cpus, changing the parameter names
that ckrm currently uses):
First off cpuset and memset has to be implemented as two different
controllers.
cpuset controller:
- 'guarantee' parameter to be used for representing cpuset(bitwise)
- 'limit' parameter to be used for exclusivity and other flags.
- Highest level class(/rcfs/taskclass) will have all cpus in its list
- Every class will maintain two sets of cpusets, one that can be inherited,
  inherit_cpuset(needed when exclusive is set in a child) and the other
  for use by the class itself, my_cpuset.
- when a new class is created (under /rcfs/taskclass), it inherits all the 
  CPUS (from inherit_cpuset).
- admin can change the cpuset of this class by echoing the new 
  cpuset(guarantee) into the 'shares' file.
- admin can set/change the exclusivity(like) flags by echoing the value(limit)
  to the 'shares' file.
- When the exclusivity flag is set in a class, the cpuset bits in this class
  will be cleared in the inherit_cpuset of the parent, and all its other
  children.
- At the time of scheduling, my_cpuset in the class of the task will be
  consulted.
memset_controller would be similar to this, before pitching it I will talk
with Matt about why he thought that there is a problem.
If I missed some feature of cpuset that shows a bigger problem, please
let me know.
