I agree. Asynchronous buses are nasty that way. However, if your "locking"
is based on device state, you can still do it: you just have to have an
internal device protocol. The simplest example of this is:
	interrupt_handler()
	{
		status = readl(dev->status);
		if (status & MY_IRQ_DISABLE)
			return;
	}
	{
		status = readl(dev->status);
		writel(dev->status, status | MY_IRQ_DISABLE);
		spin_lock();
		.. critical region ..
		spin_unlock();
		writel(dev->status, status);
	}
Notice how the above does NOT guarantee that the physical interrupt might
not be "in flight". It does, however, synchronize other ways, simply by
virtue of using the _synchronous_ bus (PCI, in this case) to figure out
when the asynchronous bus (interrupts) has a bogus event.
