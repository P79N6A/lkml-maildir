Ok. Will do.
And the ACPI people had better stop doing this crazy thing in the first 
place. There's really no point at all to freeing and re-requesting the 
interrupts, and the IRQ controller should just re-initialize itself 
instead.
The excuse for not doing so was totally ludicrous in the first place, if I
recall correctly. Use GFP_ATOMIC in ACPI if you do things with interrupts
disabled, don't break a million drivers.
