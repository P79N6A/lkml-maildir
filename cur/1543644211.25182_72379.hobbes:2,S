Sigh.
While the goal is certainly good and true, the implementation really stinks.
You simply cannot "harden" drivers by adding additional statistics nor 
by printing diagnostic messages via printk().  Further, centralizing 
--domain-specific-- diagnostics and statistics is just plain moving in 
the wrong direction.
Hardening drivers is a __human__ problem.  People use existing APIs and 
fuck up, thus creating bugs.  You are attempting to paper it over with 
buzzword-compliant features, but not actually addressing the real 
problem.  Adding silly APIs does not fix this.  You can't avoid getting 
down and dirty and actually fixing the drivers, and fixing up the 
_existing_ APIs so that humans create fewer bugs.
I fully support hardening, and "carrier grade linux."  This just ain't 
the way to do it.

Viro sees your sample driver...]
