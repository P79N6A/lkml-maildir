Thanks a lot! Sorry about the incorrect numbering, first time I've
done an intro. I'll have to send you a patch against the differences
between 2.6.12-rc4 and 2.6.12-rc4-mm2 so we don't run into a huge
amount of trouble when they merge...
A quick glance through everything looks fine, but I'll do a proper
check tomorrow using your git tree.

Yes it will be good to get back to my own area for a bit, maybe even
finally get bmcsensors into a state where it can be accepted :-),
however it has been a nice break and I can see other areas that could
benefit from things along the line of this patch so I might yet
intrude upon the rest of the kernel again ;-).
Thanks,
Yani
