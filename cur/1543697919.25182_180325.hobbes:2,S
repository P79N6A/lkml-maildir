I tried both of these, but the BIOS update changed nothing, and "acpi=off" 
just switched off acpi. The only thing I can tell is that my battery icon in 
KDE has disappeared... My CPU speed remains unaffected. *sigh*

Yes, it is. I left my battery at home today, but borrowed one off a colleague. 
Inserting it did not change anything (at least after a minute or so) but 
rebooting with the battery insterted did speed the machine up. Similarly, 
after removing the battery, the CPU stayed at full speed.
Is there anything I can do about this apart from go back to 2.4 (I've grown to 
like CONFIG_PREEMPT too much for that!) or run with the battery in all the 
time? - I've a string of past laptops where the batteries only last 5 minutes 
because of running with battery + ac power all the time, so I've been in the 
habit of always removing it these days... - I've never had a problem running 
it at max speed with 2.4.
Seems that this is a fault of a better implementation of something... But 
"better" to me shouldn't take away choice of cpu speed from the user? ;)
Thanks,
Simon
