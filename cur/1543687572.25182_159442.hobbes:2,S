I use the serial line to connect my computer with linux box, and I use the SecureCRT.
The following is the corresponding configuration of linux box' inittab file.
# Serial lines
s1:12345:respawn:/sbin/agetty -L 9600 ttyS0 vt100
s2:12345:respawn:/sbin/agetty 9600 ttyS1 vt100
Thank you, dear Dick Johnson
Bill
