Hello folks,
I am experiencing an unexpected problem with Linux 2.6.0-test1-bk3 on
my Acer TravelMate 800LCi Centrino Notebook (Intel 855PM, Pentim M at
1.3GHz). It appears ACPI loads fine at boot time but after I logged in, 
there is no /proc/acpi/sleep which is necessary to send the notebook 
into sleep state and the like. Is this maybe a known problem is a fix 
for it available somewhere? If you need other information like the 
dmesg output or something else, let me know please.
