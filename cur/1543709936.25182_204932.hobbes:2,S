Whatever's going on, this looks like objrmap will turn into a quagmire.
I was vaguely holding out for anobjrmap to come in and get rid of the
dependency of the pte_chain -based ptov resolution on struct page. So,
any ideas on how to kick pte_chains of the habit of shoving information
in pagetable nodes' struct pages or am I (worst case) stuck eating
grossly oversized pagetable nodes and horrific internal fragmentation
(<= 20% pagetable utilization with 4K already) no matter what?
I guess I could allocate an array of the things pte_chains want in
struct pages and attach it to ->private at allocation-time, but that's
even worse wrt. cache and space footprint than the current state of
affairs, worse still on 32-bit, and scales poorly to small PAGE_MMUCOUNT.
I guess ->lru and ->list may handle it up to 4, but that smells bad.
My second guess is that with PAGE_MMUCOUNT >= 2 and only using one
pte_chain entry per PAGE_MMUCOUNT aligned and contiguous ptes, it's
still a net space win to just put information directly beside the
(potentially physical) pte pointers in the pte_chains.
Do either of these sound desirable? Any other ideas?
