Hi there.
I have 2 old network cards named ExpertLan INET-906 with the
W89C906F chip labeled on them. I though they were NE2000 compatible.
When I install them using the appropriate modules (ne.c and 89??.c - sorry I
am not @ home dont remember the second name properly) from the kernel tree
linux-2.2.10 the detection cames ok, they are ne2000 compatible (from the
driver point of view) and the printk say the apropriate MAC address.
These NIC's are old ... They are ISA and the setup is done by a DOS program
where I say which IO-PORT and IRQ they will use. Also the settings for the
cable (BNC or other) is done with that program.
Now when I trow out a packet the kernel says It might be a cable problem.
Now I have a fresh made BNC (Thin Ethernet) cable and the cards apear to be
right from health. Could this be that these particular old cards are not
supported ?
I made some 'searches' in the net and only found 1 link for a windows 95
driver for a compatible board. No Linux links ... nothing.
Well might Donald Becker know something about these types of cards ?
Thanks in advance,
