Subject: [bug] USB pegasus driver (perhaps USB core?) no longer functions  correctly
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Ok, more bothersome irk.  =|
test8-pre4 was the last kernel the pegasus driver worked in.  Since then
it refuses to go online.  The code in the pegasus.c file hasn't changed,
so somebody in the middle broke. All the changes seem to have happened
in pre5. Here's what I've gleaned thusfar.
Messages trimmed for context:

----------------------------------
For the pegasus output, the real difference is only the 'link
NOT established...' line.  Other things seem to work if I plug them in
after boot up or if I unplug/plug.  I.e. a Logitech mouse, doesn't show
up unless I unplug it then put it back in, then /dev/input/mouse0 shows
up.
