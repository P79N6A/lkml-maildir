They have to export the temperature through a thermal ACPI
device, not through the ASUS specific ATK0110 device. This is
what I mean whether there might be other vendor specific ACPI
devices violating the spec (by providing temperature read
functionality which should be done through the generic thermal
ACPI device).

I know about this problem.

Yes, this is even worse as the check that you want to add will not
catch it. Looking a bit through ASUS DSDTs this seem to be common
on most of them. I put some example DSDT code of a recent M2A-VM-HDMI
workstation at the end.

Hmm, grep -r ATK0110 drivers/platform/x86 in latest ACPI test tree is
empty, can you give me a pointer to a recent version of your driver.

I expect that ASUS only will interfere with specific hwmon driver(s)?
So why don't you move the check into the hwmon driver and make it not
load on these systems?
It's still ugly, but IMO better than to pollute the ACPI core.
Here some thermal DSDT parts of a recent ASUS machine:
The temperature exported through the generic thermal ACPI device:
    OperationRegion (IP, SystemIO, 0x022D, 0x02)
    Field (IP, ByteAcc, NoLock, Preserve)
    {
        INDX,   8,
        DAT0,   8
    }
    Method (SBYT, 2, NotSerialized)
    {
        Store (Arg0, INDX)
        Store (Arg1, DAT0)
    }
    Method (GBYT, 1, NotSerialized)
    {
        Store (Arg0, INDX)
        Store (DAT0, Local0)
        Return (Local0)
    }
Method (_TMP, 0, NotSerialized)
    {
    /* makes use of RTMP which uses GBYT and SBYT to actually read
       the temp
    */
    }
There is another RTMP function in ATK0110 (do you use that?)
The other RTMP in ATK0110 seem to use this IO area to read out
the temperatures (MBTE and TSR1, for mainboard and CPU temp?):
                OperationRegion (HWRE, SystemIO, 0x022D, 0x02)
                Field (HWRE, ByteAcc, NoLock, Preserve)
                {
                    HIDX,   8,
                    HDAT,   8
                }
                IndexField (HIDX, HDAT, ByteAcc, NoLock, Preserve)
                {
                            Offset (0x0B),
                    FD11,   3,
                    FD12,   3,
                    FD13,   1,
                            Offset (0x0C),
                            Offset (0x0D),
                    FAN1,   8,
                    FAN2,   8,
                            Offset (0x18),
                    FEN1,   8,
                    FEN2,   8,
                            Offset (0x20),
                    VCOR,   8,
                    V33V,   8,
                            Offset (0x23),
                    V50V,   8,
                    V12V,   8,
                            Offset (0x29),
                    TSR1,   8,
                    MBTE,   8,
                            Offset (0x80),
                    FAN3,   8,
                    FEN3,   8
                }
Can the hwmon people identify which hwmon driver is used
for above devices and the ATK0110 check be inserted there.
On the M2A-VM-HDMI machine where DSDT extracts from above are,
running libsensors I get:
Driver `it87' (should be inserted):
  Detects correctly:
  * ISA bus, address 0x228
    Chip `ITE IT8716F Super IO Sensors' (confidence: 9)
Driver `to-be-written' (should be inserted):
  Detects correctly:
  * Chip `AMD K10 thermal sensors' (confidence: 9)
If this is an ASUS only problem with very specific thermal
sensors, better add the quirk at the specific sensor driver.
If this is something general, then maybe you can convince Len
to add something to the ACPI core, but this should be more
generic then.

PS: I just realize that in ATK0110 the same thermal device
(IO port 0x22D) is used as in the generic ACPI device (_TMP).
So it looks like your asus thermal driver will not only interfere
with the hwmon driver, but with the ACPI thermal driver itself.
