I haven't looked at the patch nor tried it.
If the patch changes the behavior that the main thread, after calling
sys_exit, still react to signals sent to this thread or to the process
as a whole, then the patch is wrong.  The userlevel context of the
thread is not usable anymore.  It will have run all kinds of
destructors.  The current behavior is AFAIK that the main thread won't
react to any signal anymore.  That is absolutely required.
