One needs to treat any test which involves networking to localhost
with caution.  They tend to show large (+/- 10% or more) swings
in throughput from one run to the next.  Some sort of cache
associativity thing; not sure.
Running the test between separate machines is much, much more repeatable.
We'll get the cpu-local hot pages list code going soon; that may
provide some benefit to this sort of thing.  Even on uniprocessor.
