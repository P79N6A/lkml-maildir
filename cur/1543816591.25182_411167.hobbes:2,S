OK, we are sharing the same goal even now.
I failed to mention that as you know this synchronous error detection
would be required if the async-callback needs to touch the hardware
due to recover it or to pick up diagnostic data during kernel-initiated
recovery. (I found a word "pci_check_whatever() API" at your comment
in document, Documentation/pci-error-recovery.txt)

Hmm, what I meant is that:
   There is an arch that chooses reboot on bus error.
   The reason why it do so is that the design is based on the assumption
   that no driver is able to handle bus error and that almost all drivers
   will go without checking hardware status. So the arch chooses rebooting
   rather than polluting user data.
   The design allows OS to determine whether the system goes reboot or not,
   but OS has no idea to know which driver actually check hardware state.
Therefore this interface will help OS to know which driver is reliable.
Of course there are some arch that chooses not to panic/reboot on bus error.
I think they are believing that all drivers working on the arch can handle
any type of errors, or they have their special feature against errors...,
or just being idiot about hardware errors.
Anyway, all that is certain is that:
  - To check the data from hardware, driver need to ask anywhere synchronously.
  - "Anywhere" would be a register, and/or something in kernel/hardware.
  - State check would be architecture dependent routine work.
