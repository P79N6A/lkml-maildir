[Pleae read the complete Problem an then Reply or Comment]
----------------------------------------------------------
Problem: When I use my Linux PC to run Audio-CD-ROMS it plays only from one
speaker, i.e right one, But rest of the files like midi and wav play from
both.
I have a Aztech SC-16 3D Sound Card PnP for Windows. [Note: I have even
tried isapnptools but came up with same problem]
I have a IDE Teacmedia 28x CDROM and works fine under Windows-95-98, it
attaches directly to IDE cable and posed no problem while data reading under
Linux.
I have been using Linux for 2 years and I have a good knowledge of It. I
have explored all possibilities but now I am tired.
I Know: 
-------
1. Audio is played directly from cable and there is no cable fault,
as the CD's (audio) get played in Windows-9 from both the speakers. I HAVE
CHECKED THAT.
2. The mixer setting are all right I have checked with more that two mixers.
3. I use the RedHat-5.2 with latest 2.3.5 Kernel.
-------
What I suspect more is:
-----------------------
1. It is either CDROM  driver Problem or SoundCard, But if it would have
been a sound card problem then why would it play wav and midi files so well.
