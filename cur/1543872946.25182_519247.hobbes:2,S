Interaction wants low latency, getting that is traditionally expressed
in priorities - the highest prio gets the least latency (all RTOSs work
like that).
There is nothing that warrants giving them more CPU time IMHO; if you
think they deserve more, express that using priorities.
Priorities are a well understood concept and they work; heuristics can
(and Murphy tells us they will) go wrong.
Getting the server/client thing working can be done without heuristics
using class based scheduling.
