Fair enough!

Agreed!

Almost always, yes.  But a spinlock is cheaper than a spinlock plus
a pair of memory barriers.

My concern is that currently a majority of the calls to __kfifo_{get,put}()
are already holding a spinlock.
But if you could send me your tests for lock-free __kfifo_{get,put}(),
I would be happy to run them on weak-memory-consistency model machines
with the memory barriers.  And without the memory barriers -- we need
a test that fails in the latter case to prove that the memory barriers
really are in the right place and that all of them are present.
Does this sound reasonable?
