Is it possible to profile the kernel? Somewhere there's a bottleneck in my
system which results in high loads (but top doesn't display the percentages
correctly, ie idle == 70%, while system load is 0.80 or something) ...
I suspect it is the IDE subsystem but like to know for sure so I won't
purchase scsi perpherals for nothing...
