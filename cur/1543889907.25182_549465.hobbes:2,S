CPUs are so fast now that we never even get into polling mode.
So MSI makes even more of a difference.
davem and jamal hadi salim were already years ago seeing workloads
(packet rates) where the CPU utilization would peak at packet rates
that were just high enough for NAPI to occasionally be used.
IIRC, Jamal's OLS 2005 or 2006 paper talks about this behavior.

Yes, I agree.
