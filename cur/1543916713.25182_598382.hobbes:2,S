I actively want to avoid giving message numbers.  My interest is in 
selectively removing messages from the kernel to shrink the binary size (and 
NOT make it up in either a larger userspace utility to translate them, or 
else magic proprietary numbers you can only diagnose if you pay my support 
staff).

This does not address my problem.  Spitting out a proprietary hash code 
instead of a human readable message is not a solution for my use case.
