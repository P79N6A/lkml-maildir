After backing out lots of changes, I've figured out the problem is caused by 
this bit of 2.6.16-rc6:
diff -urN linux-2.6.16-rc5/kernel/sched.c linux-2.6.16-rc6/kernel/sched.c
--- linux-2.6.16-rc5/kernel/sched.c	2006-05-11 20:04:18.000000000 +0200

 		return;
+	if (unlikely(system_state != SYSTEM_RUNNING))
+		return;
 	do {
 		add_preempt_count(PREEMPT_ACTIVE);
 		schedule();
The problem is that (to save a couple of bits of space), my simple installer 
was running inside an initrd -- and system_state isn't set to SYSTEM_RUNNING 
before linuxrc is executed --> scheduler breakage causes the oops.
Since initrds are deprecated anyway, I've used this opportunity to update the 
installer to use initramfs instead, and as expected, the problem went away -- 
nevertheless [unless initrds are being removed in 2.6.18 anyway] we should 
probably fix this or at least document it somewhe.
