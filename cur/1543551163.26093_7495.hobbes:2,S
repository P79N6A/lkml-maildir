I am one of those people that uses PCMCIA on an SMP machine, I also use 2.4. Aside from the very occasional problem, I don't see any locking issues. Is it possible to just leave it as is with a warning?
If someone is willing to help get me started? I'll go through and try to clean up the SMP safeness issues.
