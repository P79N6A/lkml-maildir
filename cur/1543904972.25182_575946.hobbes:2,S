If you're done being an ass, take note of the fact that I never even said you 
were doing that. What I was commenting on was the fact that you (and a lot of 
the other developers) seem to keep saying "It doesn't happen here, so it 
doesn't matter!" - ie: If I don't see something happening, it doesn't matter.

I've been trying to do that since the thread started. Note that you snipped 
where I said (and I'm going to paraphrase myself) "There is another way to 
fix this, but I don't have the understanding necessary".
Now, once more, I'm going to ask: What is so terribly wrong with swap 
prefetch? Why does it seem that everyone against it says "Its treating a 
symptom, so it can't go in"?
Try coming up with an answer that isn't "I don't see the problem on my $10K 
system" or similar - try explaining it based on the *technical* merits. Does 
it cause the processor cache to get thrashed? Does it create locking 
problems?
I stand by my statements, as vitriolic as you and Rene seem to want to get 
over it. So far in this thread I have not seen one bit of *technical* 
discussion over the merits, just the bits I've simplified and stated before.

I am. You being nasty when somebody gets fed up with a line of BS doesn't stop 
me from having a nice day. Only thing that could make my life any better 
would be to have the questions I've asked answered, rather than having 
supposedly intelligent people act like trolls.
