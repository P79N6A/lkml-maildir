No, I think you're right. And I think just fixing send_sig_info() to take 
the tasklist lock is the right thing to do.
That still leaves force_sig_info() without the tasklist lock, but since 
that is only used for page faults etc synchronous errors, that's fine (if 
we get a synchronous error in the kernel, we have bigger problems than 
signal locking).
