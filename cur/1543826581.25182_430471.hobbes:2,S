Yup that looks cleaner.

Yes we need to hear from Martin.

It looks though as if the testers were able to define more than 32 swap 
devices. So there is the danger of overwriting the memory 
following the swap info if we do not fix this.
Where are the macro contortions? No arch uses MAX_SWAPFILES_SHIFT for its 
definitions and the only other significant use is in swapops.h to 
determine the shift.
