Okay, here are the test results:
- heavy load + nvidia (binary module) + bttv with grabdisplay = crash
- heavy load + nv (not tainted kernel) + bttv with grabdisplay = crash
- heavy load + nvidia (binary module) + bttv with overlay = OK
- heavy load + nv (not tainted kernel) + bttv with overlay = OK
Adding vmware on top of it will cause the system sooner to freeze/crash
(using grabdisplay)
So what you think guys ?
