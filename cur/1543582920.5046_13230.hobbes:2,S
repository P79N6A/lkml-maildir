OK, I hate to CC all these lists, but I guess it would be best
to try and end this thread now ;)
If you want to learn about the structure of the Linux kernel,
you should probably go to:
	
http://kernelnewbies.org/
and
	irc.openprojects.net   #kernelnewbies
You can also try the mailing list:
	echo subscribe kernelnewbies | mail  majordomo@kernelnewbies.org
----
And please ... stop this thread on all the other mailing lists,
move your discussions to a more suitable forum and limit it to
that forum.
regards,
Rik
