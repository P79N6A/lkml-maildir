Go look at the call sites for this function - I bet that most of them, if they
check the return code at all, only check for zero or nonzero, because they only
*care* about the case that returns zero. Since they already know they're not
passing a NULL pointer, they don't worry about that case returning a 1.  So
there's only two realistic returns - either the module is live or it isn't.
