If you want a sign, here it is: I plan to submit the driver upstream :-)
After more than a year of development, the Linux UVC driver is now stable 
enough to be included in the kernel. There is a show stopper though: V4L2.
The UVC specification defines a set of standard controls. Most of them are 
part of the V4L2 specification as well (brightness, contrast, ...), but some 
of them aren't. Those controls are currently exposed through private controls 
(which drivers are allowed to expose by V4L2), but I don't want to keep 
private controls around for standard controls defined by UVC.
Once V4L2 will be updated (hopefully soon, I keep trying :-)), I will submit 
the driver upstream.
