  it. Imagine needing 3 MB of swap for every apache child
  being forked ... (ditto for mysql, sendmail, ...)
size issues aside, proper accounting that allows linux to better
predict when to say no is surely better than after the fact
killing. It seems cleaner to have code to predict, than to kill. Then
we could gracefully say no, rather than ungracefully have to say
"die" to quite possibly innocent programmes.
(of course i have no idea how complicated proper accounting and usage
prediction could be....)
