I just lost 0x40 which needs to be exactly 0x40 if it is do its job (i.e.
cope with brain dead BIOS writers using 0x40 as a segment offset in
protected mode ...
The idea is that segment 0x40 maps from physical address 0x400 to the end
of the first physical page.  As a real mode program would (more or less)
expect it to.
The other three segments don't matter as longs as they are in that order
and contiguous.
