Well you will still need some ifdef's since readl/writel are only
defined for ISA/PCI style memory mappings - you should not use them on
NuBus, SBUS or Zorro mapped memory.

Actually it is not very hard to imagine, some busses a cache coherent,
some are not. Some busses do not provide a linear mapping of the
memory even when it is memory mapped, the sparse memory found in some
Alphas is an example of this. So basically you cannot expect PCI
shared memory to have the same access semantics as NuBus memory. In
this case you will always end up with #ifdef's in your driver.
