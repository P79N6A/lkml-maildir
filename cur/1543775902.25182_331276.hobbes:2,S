I've wondered why this is so too occasionally.  AFAICT, we are
doing everything correctly from the filesystem point of view,
we are just not being told of the larger device size when we
query it.  So, it was interesting to hear that sysfs reports
the correct size..
From a quick look through the code - it seems sysfs reports the
value from the struct genhd ->capacity field (get_capacity and
set_capacity from <linux/genhd.h>).  Whereas the other block
device interfaces are looking at the struct block_device bd_inode
->i_size field.  So, it kinda looks like a coherency issue
between those two beasts - someone more familiar with the block
layer may be able to suggest a fix (Christoph/Jens/Al/...).

I'm not aware of a fix, and the last time I looked using a volume
manager doesn't resolve this issue either.
cheers.
