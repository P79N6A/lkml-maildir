I'm running 2.3.42 (P-III/450) on one box and 2.2.14 on the other
(Cyrix-M2/333), both compiled with egcs-2.91.66 (1.1.2) and
binutils-2.9.5.0.22, but since upgrading to gcc-2.95.2 on the P-III, I
get parse errors etc. on signal.c 2.3.43 and 2.3.44-pre8.
 I've since upgraded binutils to 2.9.5.0.27 with the same results, so
the problem appears to be with gcc-2.95.2.

 	On the other box (M2/333) with 2.9.1.66 (egcs-1.1.2) and
binutils-2.9.5.0.22,
 I get different errors with 2.3.43 (???) and 2.3.44-pre8
(drivers/hamradio), "structure has no member `tbusy' etc. etc., but no
problems with signal.c.
