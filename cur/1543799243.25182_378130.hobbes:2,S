Uhh, what part of disk/NFS/filesystem access is "interactive"?  Which  
of those sleeps directly involve responding to user-interface  
events?  _That_ is the whole point of the interactivity bonus, and  
precisely why Ingo introduced TASK_NONINTERACTIVE sleeps; so that  
processes that are not being useful for interactivity could be moved  
away from TASK_NONINTERRUPTABLE, with the end result that the X- 
server could be run at priority 0 without harming interactivity, even  
during heavy *disk*, *NFS*, and *network* activity.  Admittedly, that  
may not be what some people want, but they're welcome to turn off the  
interactivity bonuses via some file in /proc (sorry, don't remember  
which at the moment).
Cheers,
