Well, not "lately", it has been quite a while. But lets celebrate the
fact that there is somebody trying to fight this battle one more time
and update this tcp.h dependency tree... /me looks for hviz... and if
graphviz is installed, ok:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/acme/hviz
hviz include/linux/tcp.h 10 | dot -Tpdf > /tmp/tcp.h.2007_11.pdf

We still get to sched.h, but before it was:
linux/tcp.h -> linux/skbuff.h -> linux/mm.h -> linux/sched.h
Nowadays its:
linux/tcp.h -> linux/sock.h -> linux/netdevice.h -> linux/interrupt.h -> linux/sched.h
And I just removed "#include <linux/sched.h> from linux/interrupt.h,
because as far as I checked it is completely unnecessary, and the
kernel builds just fine :-)
