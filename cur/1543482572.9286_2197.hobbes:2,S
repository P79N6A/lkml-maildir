Religious or not one point you forget is the fact that there
are many other tools out there, which can be used for quality
assurance other then gdb... (mainly gcov and gprof are the ones
I'm aware of) However I agree with you up to some degree
with the point that too many easy used "fancy" debugging tools are 
encouraging poor coding style and in esp. coding by try and error...
