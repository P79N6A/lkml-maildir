I must admit I keep my settings on the default (1000/200000) and get  
whatever my disks can handle, usually 50-70MB/sec. All this is on a  
completely idle system, doing anything disk bound at all will lower  
these numbers significantly. This is on various SATA controllers, all  
with Seagate drives.
