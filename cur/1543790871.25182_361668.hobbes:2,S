Thanks.
I have one more question. 
Why ip6_mc_source() uses read_lock_bh(&ipv6_sk_mc_lock) and ip6_mc_msfilter() doesn't use ipv6_sk_mc_lock at all. 
when ipv6_mc_list's sflist are accessed by inet6_mc_check(), Can it be modified by ip6_mc_source() or ip6_mc_msfilter() ?
(For example ipv6_mc_list's sflist is freed up by sock_kfree_s(), when inet6_mc_check() uses it)
                                                                   Regards
