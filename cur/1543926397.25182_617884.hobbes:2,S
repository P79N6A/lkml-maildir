ok, i'll first try to trigger it again.
it's a bzImage kernel with fixed order of eth0 and eth1 detection. What 
i did was to twiddle the /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth* 
configs to address a network-does-not-show-up bug that .24 introduced. 
The crash logs contain this:
 VFS: Mounted root (ext3 filesystem) readonly.
 Freeing unused kernel memory: 396k freed
 Write protecting the kernel read-only data: 2056k
 udev: renamed network interface eth1 to eth0
 udev: renamed network interface eth0_rename to eth1
 eth0: link down
 ADDRCONF(NETDEV_UP): eth0: link is not ready
 EXT3 FS on sda6, internal journal
 kjournald starting.  Commit interval 5 seconds
followed by the crash shortly afterwards (but not immediately). With the 
non-crashing kernel i dont get those "renamed network interface" 
messages.
network interface renaming has been a historic source of pain for me so 
i frequently have to 'twiddle' the networking config to make it work 
again on new kernels. Perhaps because i'm using bzImage kernels. 
User-space is Fedora 8, so fairly recent.
