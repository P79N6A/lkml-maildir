Hello,
	Is this behaviour supposed to be?
9:36 root@kiza /dev# l null 
crw-rw-rw-    1 root     root       1,   3 Jan  1  1970 null
9:36 root@kiza /dev# rm null
removing `null'
9:36 root@kiza /dev# l null
ls: null: No such file or directory
9:36 root@kiza /dev#
	I have kernel 2.4.16 with devfs and on every other system I tried I 
only get "rm: cannot unlink `null': Operation not permitted" when trying to 
delete something in devfs. And I cannot see any differences as far as devfs is 
concerned on the systems I tried. devfs compiled in, mounted on boot time, 
same version of devfsd.
Regards,
Oliver
