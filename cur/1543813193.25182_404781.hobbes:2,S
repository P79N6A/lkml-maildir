a change of struct inotify_event can't change ABI, can you describe it 
more clear?

Of course, current process/thread never disappears before fsnotify_* 
returns.

Your concern is correct, but uid and git can give out some hints, I ever 
considered to
save the name of current process, however that needs a bigger and 
length-variable
inotify_event struct, moreover, to get the full path name of current 
process/thread
in kernel will have a big overhead, so I must select a comprise way. In 
fact, the case
 you said is very few.
