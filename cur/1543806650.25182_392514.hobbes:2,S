Hello, Vladimir.
How reproducible is the problem?  With how much certainty can you say 
the problem is introduced by newer kernels?  e.g. If the problem occurs 
most of the time with 2.5.15.1 but it stops happending after switching 
back to 2.6.13.3, you can be pretty sure.
Can you also please post dmesg of 2.6.13.3?
