Greets,
Is there going to be some kind of a converter for new reiserfs version?
I'm running 2.4.22-rc1 now, with its current reiserfs implementation, and I 
heard many good things about reiserfs v4, would it be possible to convert 
filesystems without data loss? 
It's going to be a major pain if I'll have to back things up and reinitialize 
partitions...
Thanks in advance.
