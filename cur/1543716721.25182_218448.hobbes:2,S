I think it does as temps are lower then linux without disconnect.
Here are some temperatures from my machine read from the bios on reboot.
I gave it minimal activity for the minutes prior to reboot.
 Win98, 47C
 XPHome, 42C
 Patched Linux 2.4.24 (1000Hz), 40C
 Linux 2.6.3-rc1-mm1, 53C  with no disconnect
I think the disconnect happens for less time percentage. With slower
ticks one might assume less often than linux.
