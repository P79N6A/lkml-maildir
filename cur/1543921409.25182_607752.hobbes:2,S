Is there any reason you assume it is a rt73usb device,
or are you just making wild guesses about what the chipset is?

You mean expanding the project name to the full list of developers in
the project? I don't see any need for that.

Both removals of -ENODEV are completely wrong. If the device does not pass the above
2 checks it is _not_ a rt73usb device. And forcing the driver to work with the device will
result in all kinds of problems.
If rt2x00 is loaded and detected the device, it should print out a debug message that starts with:
"Chipset detected - " What is in your case the complete line?
