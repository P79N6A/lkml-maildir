i've been chatting with Paul on irc about it

from reading other drivers and the documentation, i couldnt determine
whether this was the standard behavior or whether set_alarm simply set
the alarm time but you still needed to call the ioctl RTC_AIE_ON in
order to actual enable it

because other drivers do ?  there is no documentation here that covers
what exactly the read_alarm function in the rtc_class_ops is supposed
to do which leaves it up to people looking at other drivers
rtc-sa1100.c for example:
static int sa1100_rtc_read_alarm(struct device *dev, struct rtc_wkalrm *alrm)
{
    memcpy(&alrm->time, &rtc_alarm, sizeof(struct rtc_time));
    alrm->pending = RTSR & RTSR_AL ? 1 : 0;
    return 0;
}
if someone decides what the behavior is supposed to be here, i'll
happily implement it

i dont understand this ... rtc-sh.c and rtc-sa1100.c both do a
seq_printf() for the alarm irq

the reason for this is so that i do not have to worry about keeping
two structures in sync ... there's the common RTC representation and
then there's the funky Blackfin representation, so by delaying the
conversion until RTC_AIE_ON, i didnt have to worry about keeping these
fields in sync

this is exactly why i'm checking tm_yday ... the rtc-dev interface
sets those fields to -1 when using the WKALM ioctls and there's no
other way to distinguish this
if the wraparound case is so common, then perhaps it should be a
helper function in the generic rtc code rather than reimplementing in
every rtc driver ...

i'll take a look
