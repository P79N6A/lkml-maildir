Sorry, haven't had any time yesterday.
So my 10¢ comment for the patches (like the ones in -rc6).
1. Braindead pausings are GONE (mouse is not sticky as w/o the patch).
2. Mouse sticks are still there rarely (short ones, max. 1 second)
    (If one can say 1 second is short ...).
3. all three patches are needed.
No side effects yet tho. Works with SCSI, IDE and SMP.
ciao, Marc
