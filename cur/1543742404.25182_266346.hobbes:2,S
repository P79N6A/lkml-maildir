Subject: Call to mmap Failing in SVGALIB

  Hi, I've just started using the 2.6.9 kernel in place of the 2.6.7 kernel 
and now the vga_init call into svgalib is failing. The problem appears to be 
a call to mmap inside the library. Since I see in the change log that there 
have been changes, and fixes to changes, in mmap, I suspect that this is a 
problem with the new kernel, and not the svgalib.
  Are there any kernel config options that might be a help in using the 
older mmap or perhaps there are some options that configure mmap usage? I 
didn't see any.
  I haven't provided any too detailed information, in case nobody is 
interested. But if somebody is interested in knowing how this is failing 
then I'll supply more details.
Thanks,
Joseph
