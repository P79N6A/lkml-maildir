Both of these patches are in 2.6.3-rc2-mm1.
I (almost) never silently drop patches.  If you sent something and didn't
hear back, assume it went in.
I usually don't ack patches either, sorry.  Probably I should - davem does.
Generally it's just noise.  I will ack if I made changes to the patch, or
need more details, etc.   I shall try to be ackier.
If you didn't hear, and the next -mm does not contain your patch, and you
care about it even a little bit, please remind me.
It helps me if the reminder contains a fresh copy of the patch, with your
description.
If the patch is urgent then please flag it as such.  We're at -rc now, and
these patches don't look urgent to me, so I shall sit on them until after
2.6.3.
