CLONE_FILES is an argument to clone(), I'm using pthreads and I don't 
know if LinuxThreads implementation of pthreads gives me control of 
how clone is called. Anyway, if I understand what CLONE_FILES does, 
it should be given to clone, because threads do have to be able to share file 
descriptors, probably. But not the locks!
