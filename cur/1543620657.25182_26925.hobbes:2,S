This is the cue for Keith to pop up and say "fixed in kbuild 2.5".
The preprocessor is simply pasting together its -I argument and the
string from the #include statement.  There doesn't seem to be a way
of getting it to just emit "include/linux/dcache.h" or "drivers/char/serial.c".
__BASE_FILE__ seems to have been supported for a sufficiently long time.  It
will just give us "dcache.h".  I think that's OK.  We don't get full path
info for the .c files either, and I'm not aware of that causing problems - if
there's a BUG() at inode.c:1234 we seem to be able to work out which inode.c
to look at.
__BASE_FILE__ is already used a bit in spinlock.h, so I think I'll
go with that.  But I'll also take a look at all the inlined BUGs.

I noticed :)
