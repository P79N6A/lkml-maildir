Subject: Slow, persistent memory leak in 2.6.20

I think I've come across a memory leak in 2.6.20. I've upgraded to the
latest 2.6.20.17, but it didn't seem to help.
A little background: I saw something exactly like this many months ago
with a 2.6.12 kernel. However, by 2.6.16.x the leak had apparently
been fixed, so I didn't pursue it. I just assumed it had been fixed.
But either it remains in 2.6.20 or else a new leak has appeared.
FWIW, this is an x86_64 machine, but I also saw nearly the same
behavior on a i386 machine running 2.6.12. (Links to graphs showing
long-term memory usage are at the bottom of this email if you want to
skip all the text stats in the middle.)
Immediately after booting the system, I shut down all services to get
a baseline for comparison. Here is the output of top and vmstat with
virtually nothing running:

Ok, now I start back up all services and let the system run for about
12 hours. At the end of this time, I shut down all services again so
that virtually nothing is running. Here are the stats:

======================================
After 12 hours, you can see that when I shut down all of the services
there is a lot of memory being used. But where is it going?
I have compared this to a machine running i386 2.6.16.2x and when I
stop all services down to nothing but ssh, there is only a tiny amount
of RAM in use, as expected.
I can verify that this memory loss never stops: The lost memory keeps
increasing until eventually the machine goes into swap and will
eventually crash if left to its own devices. However, on machines with
big RAM, this process can take a month or more.
Here are links to three cacti graphs where you can see the effect over
the long term:
This graph is from a machine running 2.6.16.27/i386, which does not
have any memory loss. You can see the long-term memory line is flat:

Now here is a graph from a machine running 2.6.12/i386, which clearly
shows a long-term memory loss. The points where the memory shoots back
up to its full level are when the machine had to be rebooted because
it was going into swap:
    
http://i239.photobucket.com/albums/ff117/fredty8/memory-a2.png
And finally, here is a graph from a machine running 2.6.20.15/x86_64,
which shows a very similar memory loss as the 2.6.12 machine. (This
machine has only been up for a few weeks, which is why the graph is so
short. But it is clear that the graph is doing the same thing as
2.6.12):
