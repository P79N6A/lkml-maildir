I did the original port of ext2 to the hurd, and I definitely used the
linux code.  Of course the lowest- and highest-level interfaces are all
different, so that code was replaced, but the most important `middle' part
that actually interprets the disk contents was largely the same code
(the separation is not actually so clean in practice, of course).
This is as it should be, I think...
