No, this touchscreen actually has fairly reasonable pressure reporting.
I know that this is unusual.  But I get reproducible numbers when trying
soft stylus press, hard stylus press.  And things like finger touching.
Also I can actually distinguish a thumb from an index finger press ;)

see the other comments. apparently that is left to userspace.

that would require rerlatively small polling intervals.  please note
that the hardware generates interrupts when pressure != 0.  We could
start a high-granularity timer

not that I've ever noted.  But Motorola ignores many of the hardwares
capability..

I have no idea, just replaying the package names that OE uses ;)
I now have Xfbdev running on the A780.  Unfortunately due to some
strange black magic, the ts driver ceases to receive interrupts as soon
as X is started. reproducible.  The same happens with ts_test.
ts_print works very good, though.
Will do more debugging
