Subject: [BUG] mm_struct leak on cpu hotplug (s390/ppc64)

Hi,
there is an mm_struct memory leak when using cpu hotplug. Appearently
start_secondary in smp.c initializes active_mm of the cpu's idle task
and increases init_mm's mm_count. But on cpu_die the idle task's
active_mm doesn't get dropped and therefore on the next cpu_up event
(->start_secondary) it gets overwritten and the result is a forgotten
reference count to whatever mm_struct was active when the cpu
was taken down previously.
The patch below should fix this for s390 (at least it works fine for
me), but I'm not sure if it's ok to call mmdrop from __cpu_die.
Also this very same leak exists for ppc64 as well.
Any opinions?
Thanks,
Heiko
