Hi Rob!
	I'm going to ask an odd thing.  I *don't* think this should be part of
the generally-available kernel documentation.  I'm sure you can see
several reasons for this, but I'll spell them out for posterity.
	People reading the lguest *code* documentation should feel a sense of
achievement.  It starts with a slight puzzle, works its way through deep
details of code, and emerges with the reader feeling confident enough to
start hacking on it.
Thanks for your understanding!
Rusty.
