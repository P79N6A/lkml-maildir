    Are you *positive* about this?
    Mastodon Linux uses the awk out of OpenBSD ((c) Lucent 1997) and
    is able to build the 2.3.xx kernels without complaint (at least for
    awk -- there are a couple of pointless gnuisms elsewhere in the
    build process that I've been waving patches around for.)
                  ____
    david parsons \bi/     There are places where the build process depends on
                   \/  GNU stuff, but those seem to be from a simple ignorance
		                                 of Unix, not missing features.
