I tried a 2.5.65-ac4 kernel and noticed that IOAPIC on the KT400 is
still broken. So I didn't do much testing on HPT372, it does look like
it works now however.  With IOAPIC being broken I can't use the via
rhine nic or onboard VT8235 integrated sound.  IOAPIC with HPT372, via
rhine, and integrated sound all work fine on the 2.4 kernel I am using
2.4.21-pre5-ac3.
