Ok, the symptoms were: APM dies on second suspend, even if rebooted
between the suspends.  Happens with 2.2.x kernels.  2.0.x kernels and
FreeBSD worked fine.  I spend a _lot_ of time trying to figure out
what was going on.
It turns out that it is the USB device that causing the problem.  The
I/O for
  00:07.2 USB Controller: Intel Corporation 82371AB PIIX4 USB (rev 01)
(device 8086:7112) is being enabled at boot by the kernel.  (In fact
the kernel enables a bunch of stuff that it doesn't use).  This can be
fixed after boot by installing pci-utils and doing:
  setpci -s 0:7.2 command=0
I'm not sure if there is a kernel fix for this, other than disabling
pcibios_fixup_devices() and letting the drivers themselves enable the
devices if they are used.  (No sense in enabling a winmodem or
firewire if the kernel never uses it.)
I'll put together a web page for the PCG-F250 with this info and pass
it on to the linux-laptop site.

(P.S. to Michael - you might want to compile in VESA fb support and
add "vga=791" to the beginning of /etc/lilo.conf to get a nice graphic
console that takes up the whole screen.)
