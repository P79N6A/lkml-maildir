Hi Scott,
I am trying to send ICMP messages but not in reply to anything else.
We have to generate ICMP messages from scratch.
So we do not have access to an existing sk_buff structure that has all
the parameters already set.
icmp_echo(struct skbuff*) assumes that you already have the sk_buff
structure and you are just assigning a few more fields.
Do you have an idea about how can we create ICMP messages from scratch?
Thanks for the help!
