The constructor is one part of it, but what about more efficient memory
use?  If we let things fall into the default power-of-two caches, we'd
waste quite a lot of memory.
See 
http://oss.sgi.com/~sandeen/slabinfo.html
 for example.
On this machine we'd use 30% more memory by using kmem_alloc vs
kmem_cache_alloc.
