Yea, I sent an mail to LKML in the end of last year regarding this issue.
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=107275564119915&w=2
However, I think that Adaptec probably just re-make a new version of dpt_i2o.
My patch may differ from the Adaptec policy.
I thought that it may be good for someone need the driver before Adaptec 
completed the driver. What's why I uploaded my patch onto web.
The number of the access is over 1000 now after I counted it.
Please merge to Andrew's tree if Adaptec does not mind.
This is my patch same as send from Clemens.
