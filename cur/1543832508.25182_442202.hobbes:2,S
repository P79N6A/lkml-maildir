Hi all,
I have a memory area which is written by the CPU and concurrently read 
by a DMA capable device, multiple times.
Among else there are two fields in the memory area, both are 32 bits 
wide. Whenever the CPU updates the fields, I have to make sure that the 
device does not get to see a new value in field B before I updated field 
A. Conversely, it is safe to update field A anytime before field B. The 
driver has no way to know when the device is going to read any of the 
fields.
My question: Do I need wmb() within the following code?
	dma_sync_single_for_cpu(..., DMA_TO_DEVICE);
	area->a = new_val_a;
	wmb();  /* necessary? */
	area->b = new_val_b;
	dma_sync_single_for_device(..., DMA_TO_DEVICE);
Or are all changes to the area hidden from the device between 
dma_sync_single_for_cpu and _for_device, thereby making the write order 
a non-issue? Thanks,
