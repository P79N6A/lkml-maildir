How do you feel about some variant of this going into 2.6.23-rc1?  I 
initially thought of this as a 2.6.24 thing, but as it now looks solid, 
maybe we can hurry things along.
If Shaohua ports his spinlock->mutex convertion to the sched branch, we 
get some real benefits:
 - reduced latencies for desktop users
 - less kvm patches to carry in -rt (maybe none?)
