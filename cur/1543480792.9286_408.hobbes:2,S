I use a 4.51 prerelease and 2.2.0pre7-ac1 right now on ISDN to read lots
of mail and lots of web pages, and I don't see this hang.
Are you using the glibc or libc5 Communicator?  What version of
glibc/libc5 is installed on your system?  If glibc, are you using the
LD_PRELOAD=/lib/libBrokenLocale.so trick?  Do you see the hang if you
_don't_ use that trick?  What X server do you use?
I'm trying to narrow it down...
