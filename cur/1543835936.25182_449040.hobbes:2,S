This would tend to suggest that the repacker should not run constantly, 
but also that while it's running, performance could be almost as good as 
ext3.

So you run your own benchmarks, I'll run mine...  Benchmarks for 
everyone!  I'd especially like to see what performance is like with the 
repacker not running, and during the repack.  If performance during a 
repack is comparable to ext3, I think we win, although we have to amend 
that statement to "My filesystem/database has the same or bigger 
perfomance numbers than yours."
