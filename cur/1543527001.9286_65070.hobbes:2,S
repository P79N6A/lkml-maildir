What you are describing is called ethertrunking.  I'm not sure Linux can
do that (yet.)  You may be able to put something together with 'eql', tho
it's not designed for slving ethernet devices.  You could also wire something
up using PPP of Ethernet -- the two ports become channels for multi-link
PPP (assuming you can get MPPP to work properly.)
There are several vendor methods for doing ethertrunks -- Cisco, FORE,
Adaptec's Duralink...  I'm not sure there is an IETF standard track for
ethertrunking.  Someone correct me if there is.
