Hi: I'm running a 2.2.0 kernel - and everything seemed to be fine [apart
from SCSI sense errors, which I'm pretty sure were the drive flaking out
on me, since they continued when I reverted to 2.0.36 - they seem to have
gone away now that I've done a 'verify media' from the BIOS - but when I
compiled an SMP kernel, a lot [but not all] of my modules stopped
working:
depmod -ave
typically reports something like:
sound.o:
   unresolved symbol: __global_cli
   unresolved symbol: __global_save_flags
   unresolved symbol: __global_restore_flags
[this is from memory - I don't have the access to the machine from here]
There are usually other symbols missing from the modules that don't work,
but as far as I was able to tell [I only had time for a quick check
before rushing in to work this morning] they are all missing those 3
symbols [and given the '__global', I guess this is some sort of SMP
coding issue].
I haven't managed to get any networking or network fs related modules to
load due to this problem, and a lot of misc modules [sound, lp] seem to be
affected too. On the other hand, soundcore.o does seem to load without
problems.
Have I missed something obvious? is there an FM I should R? 
I can provide more details tonight, once I've had a chance to do some
more detailed checking. [ I think I've upgraded all the packeges
mentioned in Documentation changes - the one I'm not sure about is libc6- 
I have debian 2.0.7v - not sure how the 'v' relates to 'pre6'... ]
