    hda b 03 00-3f
    hdb b 03 40-7f
    Happy? ;-)

     Nothing.  That's the advantage of separating out the major and
     minor numbers -- if you explicitly list the major and minor
     numbers, userland apps don't have to know how wide a major is
     to do something with it.
     0300[40] means that I have to know that a major is the first 8 bits.
     03 00-3f means that I need to know the major is the first field, and
     that the minors run from 0 to 3f.   This is MUCH better for userland,
     because that's one less stupid detail that apps have to remember.

       They're not in a separate file right now, and putting them into
       the same file reduces the rooting around.

        Need you ask?  If I wrote a lkm, I'd have it export this
        information as a filesystem so I could mount it on /dev like G-d
        himself intended, and then I could maybe wedge a 2.4 kernel
	onto a Mastodon boot floppy [*].

        HPA as SAIC and Linus as the Department of Defense?
        The mind, it boggles.
