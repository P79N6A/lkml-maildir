Agree. ASM generated from C is far better to predict then ASM from
C++. With issues as timing dependent hardware it is crucial.
My opinion is that C++ should stay out of the kernel. Next thing someone
wants is Visual Basic in the kernel because 'it has some nice
features'. As long as the kernel in C works leave it that way.
