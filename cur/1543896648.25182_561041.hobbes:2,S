Subject: PXA270 sleeping problems after update

I just updated my linux tree from 2.6.20-rc6 to 2.6.22-rc3 for my
custom PXA270 based board and I discovered that now sleep/wakeup
functionality doesn't work anymore! :'(
After several merges, compiling stages and tests I discovered that the
problem arises from 2.6.21 to 2.6.22-rc1 and that the _real_ problem
is that the machine never goes to sleep (I discovered that by looking
at current consuming since the JTAG doesn't attach...).
Any suggestions?
Thanks a lot,
Rodolfo
