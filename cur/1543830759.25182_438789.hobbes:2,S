The tip of "master" branch has been tagged as GIT 1.4.1-rc2.
Many fixes since v1.4.1-rc1 was done, but most notable are:
 - git-cvsimport to manage multiple branches are (hopefully)
   fixed now (Martin and Johannes).
 - git-rebase learned how to use 3-way merge backends by
   "git-rebase --merge" (Eric Wong).
 - git-svn updates (Eric Wong).
 - "git-commit -m" breakage was fixed (me).
Hopefully we can merge the format-patch fixes from Johannes,
which is still cooking in "next", and do the real 1.4.1 release
this weekend.
