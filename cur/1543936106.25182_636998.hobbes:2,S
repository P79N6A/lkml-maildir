no, but now it is:
http://kerneloftruth.neucode.org/other/crash_ia32_64/not_tainted/latest/
(the other one was taken before I added/selected the demanded features)
what puzzles me is that it doesn't say "tainted" (not tainted) in the
upper part & "tainted" in the lower part
I apologize for the bad quality of the pictures ...
luckily there was also an additional call trace this time (syslog-ng
Tainted: G   D) (don't know what it means), nvidia-module wasn't
loaded and no other additional proprietary modules were loaded AFAIK
