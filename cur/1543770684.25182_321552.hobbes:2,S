Then DRM detects that at configure time and excludes the code that  
requires
AGP.  Basically, the following are valid configurations:
DRM=y AGP=y  # DRM will use AGP
DRM=y AGP=n  # DRM will not use AGP
DRM=m AGP=y  # DRM will use AGP
DRM=m AGP=m  # DRM will use AGP (DRM module depends on AGP module)
DRM=m AGP=n  # DRM will not use AGP
DRM=n AGP=*  # DRM isn't compiled and therefore doesn't care about AGP
The only invalid configuration is DRM=y AGP=m, which seems silly,  
although
theoretically in that case DRM should exclude AGP support.
