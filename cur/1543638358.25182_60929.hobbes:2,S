I was referenced to a gettimeofday problem spoken of in the kernel 
discussion summary:
http://kt.zork.net/kernel-traffic/kt20020708_174.html#1
There is spoken of .01% reproducibility and less of this problem.
I got to this problem here running a version of GNU wget (1.8.2) and 
following kernel: Linux version 2.4.18 (gcc version 2.96 20000731 (Red 
Hat Linux 7.3 2.96-110)) #4 Sun Jul 28 09:01:06 CEST 2002
In this configuration I get the error even more times. In 2300 calls I 
get 319 failures, this is something about 0.07% not too much, but 
significant.
However it is not my skill to analyze nor get to deep in wget and the 
kernel. It's just a note and a offer of some further tests if you need.
Greetings
Thomas
