Or you can use the `openssl' program.

Really, the only critical one if you're worried about people
reading/writing your data is nfsd.  mountd is second most important, but
not really if you're using the user-space NFS server.

No need for biod.

I'm not sure about statd either.  It would be safest to run this over SSL.

You could have multiple users per host, with appropriate funky mounts so
each user can only access their own secure mounts.  Either mount in a
subdirectory of a user-private directory, or use the Plan9-style
per-user mount trees (experimental patches from Al Viro).

If you put a Linux box in between to implement the SSL part :-)
It's pretty complicated, but then even a simple port-based firewall is
rather complicated with NFS.
Now, if somebody were to fix the portmapper and RPC libraries to use
sensible fixed ports, so we could sensibly firewall RPC services, they
might be tempted to implement automatic SSL tunnelling while they're
there...
