Hi:
    OOh, the original author here! Thanks a lot.
    Let's assume Mn is the total number of non-resident pages in follow 
words.
    Nod, 'M=Mh+Mc' and 'Mc+Mn' < 2M are always true.
    Have this implied that Mn is alway less than M? I think so.
    but if "Once the number exceeds M the memory size in number of pages,
we terminted the test period of the cold page pointed to by HAND-test."
    If Mn is alway less than M, when we move to HAND-test?
    Or, my view have error.
    I doublt on this, in fact.
    Good luck.
                                                                    Liyu
