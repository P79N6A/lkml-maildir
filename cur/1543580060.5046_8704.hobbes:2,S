Forgive me, I'm rather ignorant of SCSI hardware.....All that I have is a
cable (appears
to be good quality, came with motherboard) about 60 centimeters long going
from the
motherboard to my hard drive. There is an unused/empty port in between.

/proc/scsi only contains a single file named "scsi" with brief info about
the drive
According to my last save kernel config, tagged command queueing is not
enabled by default.
Could this be the problem?

I don't seem to have scsiinfo.
