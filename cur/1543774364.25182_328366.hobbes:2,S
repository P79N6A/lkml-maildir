Hi,
I'm a newbie when it comes to Linux kernel and sorry if my message is
not clear. I was wondering is there anyway that a user process can see
its list of (memory) pages that has been modified (since the last
checkpoint of the process). This is with respect to checkpoint-restart
Fault tolerance.  I want a process to write all modified pages to a
persistant file periodically (say local disk) just-in-case the process
crashed due to system failure.
Please cc me in your reply (mkkcbe@gmail.com).
