And I presume anyday now some twit will attempt to get the "fork" the
fork out of there, too. (I actually experienced this attempt once on a
DoD project I supported. The incompetent source code reviewers in DC
objected to "fork" as profanity thinly cloaked. It took a several page
letter citing the term's use in the art and related literature to get
the anal retentive creep to back down.)
"Flush" is a well known term of art. And as you note, Ruth, "sync" is
short for synchronize. Is cleaning up the use of language in the computer
arts the purpose we are all here?
