Whenever I've come across problems with multiple NIC systems the first
thing I check is the routing is what I expect. Use "route -n" and check
that your WAN traffic really does go straight to the WAN and your LAN
traffic is as you expect.
Is your local LAN connections laggy as well? If not it could be your
problems are at the WAN end (BB connection?).
