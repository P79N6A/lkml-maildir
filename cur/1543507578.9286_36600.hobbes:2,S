Subject: NFS bug in 2.3.13?

We're seeing a strange behaviour with readdir().  Sometimes we see 
the same file twice (maybe three times) in the same directory.  We
are also seeing 
    nfs_dentry_delete: src/LOD: ino=879232717, count=2, nlink=1
messages.
The setup is Linux 2.3.13 on both client and server.  User level 
NFS server in redhat 5.0 on the client.
I also saw some other problems in 2.2.9, where file permissions were
getting completely mangled.
Is any of this known?  We can probably reproduce this.
