Hi all...
I've got a BIG problem with a pentium pro 200 based server...
After a while (about 7/8 hours,  sometimes more, sometimes less, the server
has no video, all services are stopped (Netatalk disappears from the Mac's
Chooser, samba is down) Ctrl-Alt-Suppr has no effect... I changed the
server, and i got the same result, the server is connected to a RAID5 tower
(Hard) and a serial cable to an UPS... There's no log about something wrong
in /var/log/messages... Even, both server have 2 pentium Pro 200 inside. Is
there some SMP issues about that ?
Please help me, NT is waiting to take place !
Thanks
