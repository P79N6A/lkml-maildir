The (almost) standard answer you will get on the gcc mailing list is to
use gcc-2.95.2 and try again. More or less what you can expect on this
mailing list when reporting bugs with linux 2.0.30.
Compiling gcc-2.95.2 on linux systems is very easy:
  tar zxvf gcc-2.95.2.tar.gz ; mkdir build ; cd build ; \
 ../gcc-2.95.2/configure [flags]; make bootstrap ; make install

Agreed, gcc-2.95.2 is a stable compiler IMHO.

Depends on the architecture: ArmLinux 2.3.xx compiles perfectly well with
gcc-2.95.2. A couple of days ago someone (Linus, Alan?) said on this list
that he would be interested in compiler problems with linux 2.3.xx, so
that's exactly what the original poster (hi Arjan!) did.
