Ok. But ultimately that will lead to a application fault or the 
termination of the application .

The same can happen if a pagefault occurs in the application but the page 
allocator cannot satisfy the allocation. At that point we need to 
determine if the allocation was restricted. If so then we are not really 
in an OOM situation and the app could be terminated.
