To clarify -- the JFFS2 garbage collect thread is using SIGSTOP, SIGCONT
and SIGKILL from userspace to mean exactly what SIGSTOP, SIGCONT and
SIGKILL always mean in userspace.
Since it already has signal handling code, we also use SIGHUP for
wakeup, and userspace can send that too to trigger a single GC pass.
