This will allow you to generate some math-errors and see if everything
works okay. By default, upon process creation, math errors like
/0 are masked.
/*

#include <i386/fpu_control.h>
#define FPU_MASK (_FPU_MASK_IM |\
                  _FPU_MASK_DM |\
                  _FPU_MASK_ZM |\
                  _FPU_MASK_OM |\
                  _FPU_MASK_UM |\
                  _FPU_MASK_PM)
void fpu()
{
    __setfpucw(_FPU_DEFAULT & ~FPU_MASK);
}
main() {
   double zero=0.0;
   double one=1.0;
   fpu();
   one /=zero;
}

    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
