Hi,
Alan has ext2 CD-ROMs listed as not working in 2.2. I've
been messing with them today and they work fine here. Could
the people that have problems mounting such CD-ROMs please
mail me all relevant information?
I'm guessing it's not a big problem since I haven't heard
anything about until now, but it would be great to have
this fixed for 2.2.0.
