Thanks.
There are of course lots of other ways of doing it, apart from __weak. 
Many involve unpleasing ARCH_HAVE_FOO things.
Possibly cleaner would be, in kallsyms.c:
#ifndef arch_is_kernel_text
static inline int arch_is_kernel_text(unsigned long addr)
{
	return 0;
}
#define arch_is_kernel_text(addr) arch_is_kernel_text(addr)	// not really needed
#endif
and then, in a blackfin header file do
extern int arch_is_kernel_text(unsigned long addr);
#define arch_is_kernel_text(addr) arch_is_kernel_text(addr)
But personally I find all these party tricks a bit unpleasant.  The
definitive approach to implementing a per-arch kernel->arch interface is to
just implement it, dammit.  That means adding
static inline int arch_is_kernel_text(unsigned long addr)
{
	return 0;
}
to every architecture's include/asm/kallsyms.h, then doing blackfin's one
differently.
Verbose, but complete.
