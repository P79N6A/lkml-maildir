Nack.  Yet another global set of ids that require us to implement another
namespace looks like the wrong way to go.
Can you try this approach by capturing a struct pid instead of an id
in a new global namespace? 
In particular the pid of the process that creates the pid namespace.
Like we do with setsid.
I think the implementation difficulty should be about the same, but
it will allow us something that works cleanly in the cases of
migration and nested namespaces.  As well as not adding an unnecessary
special case with init_net and visibility.
