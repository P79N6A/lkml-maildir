This is actually quite easy to have happen unless you turn on
arp-filter.  Put both interfaces on the same network and funny
things happen (pkts go in one IF, and out the other...).  Now,
you could probably argue that for such advanced (or broken)
networks, the user has to just be more careful/specific.  I don't
know about the details for this specific issue, but so long as
the tool(s) allow (even if it's a PITA) one to force the
configuration to happen correctly, then it's no big deal...
