IIRC, the male usually gives either a small rock (not especially a diamond)
or a fish to the female (depending on the species).

You don't need any money. People tend to bring their own fish with them.

It sounds like a sort of _very_ broken trumpett.

Antarctic...

It's usually held on the shore. No particuliar day but usually during
spring.
