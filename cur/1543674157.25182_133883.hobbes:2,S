kdb_printf() has this:
        /* Serialize kdb_printf if multiple cpus try to write at once.
         * But if any cpu goes recursive in kdb, just print the output,
         * even if it is interleaved with any other text.
         */
        if (!KDB_STATE(PRINTF_LOCK)) {
                KDB_STATE_SET(PRINTF_LOCK);
                spin_lock(&kdb_printf_lock);
        }
	....
        if (KDB_STATE(PRINTF_LOCK)) {
                spin_unlock(&kdb_printf_lock);
                KDB_STATE_CLEAR(PRINTF_LOCK);
        }
KDB_STATE() is a per-cpu set of flags, PRINTF_LOCK indicates if this
cpu has got or is trying to get the kdb_printf_lock.  I get no
interleave problems, except when somebody prints a line in multiple
calls to kdb_printf(), the fragments are printed as one chunk but the
individual fragments can be interleaved.
