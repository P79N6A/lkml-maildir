Using USB Vendor ID/USB Product ID for identifying an USB device doesn't 
seem to bring real security since:
- every other device of the same type works as well
- using an arbitrary USB device with a manipulated
  USB Vendor ID/USB Product ID seems quite possible
It might work as an example, but if people think it would bring them 
real security that's a dangerous misunderstanding.
