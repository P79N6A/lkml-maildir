The original code is/was:
                        if(p->pid == last_pid   ||
                           p->pgrp == last_pid  ||
                           p->tgid == last_pid  ||
                           p->session == last_pid) {
                                if(++last_pid >= next_safe) {
                                        if(last_pid & 0xffff8000)
                                                last_pid = 300;
                                        next_safe = PID_MAX;
                                }
                                goto repeat;
                        }
if any process holds the pgrp=301 as in your case, 301 won't be eligible due 
to (p->pgrp == last_pid) check.
