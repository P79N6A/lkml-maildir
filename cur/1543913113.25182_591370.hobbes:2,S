The "why" is easy: Having many mappings is expensive,
so merging them (when this cause no problems) is
a smart thing to do. So that is what linux does.
It means fewer mappings to keep track of. Less resources in
use means that linux moves faster.
If you are doing research, consider these methods:
1. Change vma_merge() so it always fail to merge mappings
or
2. Set up your "mappings duplicated in userspace" so
    they too merge in the same way.
