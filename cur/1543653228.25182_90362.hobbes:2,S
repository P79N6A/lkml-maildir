Hi all,
I'm trying to resurrect SGI Visws support in 2.5 kernels and have two
problems: frambuffer console doesn't show anything and legacy device 
interrupts not working. It's difficult to debug second problem without
console :(
Framebuffer driver sets needed video mode (checked with monitor's ods)
and starts display dma engine successfuly (i can even draw lines on the
screen using memset()'s). But the beautifull linux logo doesn't apear and
console doesn't show a single pixel.
Simple(silly) questions:
	- is 2.5.4x framebuffer console code really functional ?
	- if yes, where to start debugging this issue ?
Best regards.
