Erm, note that tty drivers are supposed to handle the open/close stuff
themselves, and it is completely valid for ->close to be called while
another thread is in ->open.  In fact, it's desirable since ->open may
be waiting for the DCD line from a modem to activate, while there may
be a simultaneous O_NONBLOCK open/ioctl/close from stty.
