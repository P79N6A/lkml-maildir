I presume lscpi -n -v will tell you what you need to know. I don't know
how to read the output myself:

My card is a dual-head card, but I'm only using one head. On that head, if
I switch to virtual console 1, everything is fine, but if I switch to any
other vitual console, the display is "garbled": each row of pixels is offset
from the row before, producing interlaced "ghost" images.
I hope this helps; feel free to ask further questions.
