www.protozoa.com runs an open relay. Already was in IMRSS. I'm not too
fond of ORBS, but in this case... there it went. As for their site -
their webmaster is utter luser. JabbaScript all over the place, no fscking
idea of ALT, b0rken HTML... Bleargh. 
That *might* be a joe-job, but I doubt it - their sendmail is full of
holes, but it does rDNS. So most likely it's their own turdlet.

	Please, don't. Using any of $BIGNUM root exploits in (ancient) SGI
sendmail to log in and fix the bloody thing is also bad idea. Let them do
it themselves. Save your complaints, save the whole exchange with the
suckers, if they will fail to fix the relay - escalate to upstream, etc.
And feed them to RBL when/if there will be enough evidence.
