Unfortunately it still dies occationally.  sysrq-Boot is the only thing
that work,
I have no more data as it happened in X and console switching didn't
work.
Exactly the same behavior as VM crashes in test9-pre5 and earlier.
This is a UP machine with an ide drive, 128M ram and 96M swap.
The (memory) load was light when it crashed during a disk write,
although there were perhaps 20k in swap from some mozilla use
earlier.
