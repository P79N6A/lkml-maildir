OK thanks. I noticed another 'not clear' bit in your second patch :
void softlockup_enable(void)
{
	touch_softlockup_watchdog();
	wmb();			/* update timestamp before enable */
	__get_cpu_var(enabled) = 1;
}
Are you sure wmb() is needed here ?
I think a barrier() (compiler barrier) should be enough. If not, a nice comment would help too :)
