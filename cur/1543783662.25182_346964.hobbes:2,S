I'm in particular commenting on the stat structure involved with the

And I'm pointing out that that you're not only excluding a whole major 
portion of the kernel ABI from this mechanism if you do that, you're 
effectively requiring new mechanisms every time something is included 
into POSIX over time!  If that isn't insane, I don't know what is.
