If you don't initialize the entire structure and you use it all, of
course you get undefined behavior.  That's nothing new.  The program I
attached is not an example, it's a test for the functionality in this patch.
Like with every kernel interface, you have to use it correctly.  The
good news is that user programs should never use this syscall directly
(just like don't for existing ones).
I see no problem at all here.
