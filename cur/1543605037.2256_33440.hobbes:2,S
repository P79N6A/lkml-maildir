seems that it would be able to swap less, and not swap the wrong things enough
of the time.
Well, I cannot really comment on who does what based on the code. But I can see
the results on my machine(s). And what I see is that the current linus-tree
does not swap at all in my environment. Maybe one could say that 1 GB of RAM is
a bit oversized for most of my business, but anyway the point I started
complaining real loud about the former VM (now residing at -ac tree) was when
it came to the point where even my system started to become unusable. I am
therefore _very_ thankful to L. that he drew the line (who else could _and_
would have done it?), and Andrea of course for his work. I do not think that
Riks work is a piece of bs, really not, but it seems to have an inherent
complexity that is _very_ hard to handle. It may well be the proof for the
"keep it simple"-strategy to deliver the best results.
Anyway we should not see it as a political issue, but a friendly competition.
Because in the end, we all want the same: a system we can trust and rely on.
There is nothing wrong with having different opinions as long as you can give
_some_ proof for it. So if you say current -linus tree does more swapping,
please give us some numbers to have a look at.
Regards,
Stephan
