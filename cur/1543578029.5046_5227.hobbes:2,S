Dave, I am not complaining about drivers having to be changed for this
to work I am fully aware of this need. My complaints are about how
this is being done, ie. I some people try to maintain drivers and have
certain ideas about how they structure their code etc. If you had sent
me a short email saying this is what we plan to do and this is what we
think should be done to your code, whats your oppinion. I would have
volunteered to help write the code and get the stuff integrated much
earlier as well as given you my input on how I would like to see the
changes implemented. Instead we now have a fairly large patch which
will take me a long time to merge into the driver version that I
maintain.

I would have appreciated a simple email saying "we found bug X in your
driver" with either a patch attached or a short note of your
observations.

I don't question Alexey's skills and I have no intentions of working
against him. All I am asking is that someone lets me know if they make
major changes to my code so I can keep track of whats happening. It is
really hard to maintain code if you work on major changes while
someone else branches off in a different direction without you
knowing. It's simply a waste of everybody's time.
Thanks
Jes
