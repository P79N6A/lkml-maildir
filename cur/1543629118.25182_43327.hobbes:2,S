From arch/ppc64/kernel/iSeries_setup.c:
 * The iSeries may have very large memories ( > 128 GB ) and a partition
 * may get memory in "chunks" that may be anywhere in the 2**52 real
 * address space.  The chunks are 256K in size.
Also check out CONFIG_MSCHUNKS code and see why I'd love to see a generic
solution to this problem.
