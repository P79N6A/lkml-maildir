FYI I sent that change to Linus just now, and posted a quick update on
the Web site:

Probably..  If you are locked at 48 Khz, -something- has to upsample to
48 Khz if your audio samples are at a different frequency.  Of course
you might also be needing more CPU cycles or memory due to the required
upsampling.

To be honest I don't know yet.  I haven't fully assured myself that the
driver is doing things 100% correctly to set up variable rate.  There
-are- codecs locked at 48 Khz, so users with those codecs are stuck at
48 Khz..

It's in the tarball in the download section of
http://sourceforge.net/projects/gkernel/
