	Yes, no matter what the compression algorithm, there will
	always be data blocks which it can't compress at all.
	All algorithms will always add some book-keeping stuff of
	their own into the resulting datastream, and thus the input
	data will be wrapped into such markers -- enlarging it.
	I bet you have been moving some compressed data (GZIP,
	BZIP2, GIF, JPEG) while that did hit ?
