Or something is wrong with xmms. Right now I dont know which. I can tell you
the speed thing is unrelated. Certain vendors wire the ac97 codecs to the wrong
clock to save board space/crystals - notably dell laptops. That is why the
clocking value is a module option and you can select 'fix the sound on dell'
mode with the module option ftsodell=1
