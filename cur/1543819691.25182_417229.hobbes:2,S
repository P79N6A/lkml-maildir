Well, yes ;-).
I agree with you, but i did not have the time and the courage to redo 
the whole thing.
The original goal was to fix the support for ULE extension headers (e.g. 
for link layer security, FEC, etc.),
which is broken in the current kernel versions.
I would welcome a discussion for beautifying the dvb-core (especially 
dvb_net.c) module.

Thanks for the hint. Will do so in future patches.
