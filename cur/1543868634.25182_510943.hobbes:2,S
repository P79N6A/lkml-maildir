This card is sold by TranquilPC for their T2e case which holds Mini-ITX
boards. My EN12000 has the latest BIOS I could find on the VIA site:
http://www.via.com.tw/en/products/mainboards/downloads.jsp?motherboard_id=399#BIOS
I just tested with Device Number 12 and DN 18 (the only free locations
to try besides the DN 19 default, if I am correct on this).
DN 12 gave me this:
00:0c.0 Multimedia controller: Philips Semiconductors SAA7146 (rev 01)
        Subsystem: TERRATEC Electronic GmbH Unknown device 1157
        Flags: medium devsel, IRQ 255
        Memory at fdfff000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=512]
No irq! The other card remained at DN20 and irq 20.
So no visible i2c at all (!) for the DVB-T card.
DN 18 gave me:
00:12.0 Multimedia controller: Philips Semiconductors SAA7146 (rev 01)
        Subsystem: TERRATEC Electronic GmbH Unknown device 1157
        Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 32, IRQ 20
        Memory at fdffc000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=512]
00:14.0 Multimedia controller: Philips Semiconductors SAA7146 (rev 01)
        Subsystem: TERRATEC Electronic GmbH Unknown device 1155
        Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 32, IRQ 21
        Memory at fdffb000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=512]
The DVB-T card had the same problems as with DN19 in irq mode. Visible
i2c bus but not usable i2c.
Any ideas about how to proceed?
What to test?
BTW:
Another case I am considering has this drawing for the riser:

DN ranges from 20 to 31. Would this improve the situation?
Kind regards,
Udo
