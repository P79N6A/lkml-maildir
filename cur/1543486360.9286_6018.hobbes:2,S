We don't need all permutations, just all ancestors.

We already have to do this.  Just don't confuse the existence of a
directory in the dcache with the existence of every path to that directory
being in the dcache.  It should be fine to have just the first path to
the directory in the dcache -- as long as this also is true for every
ancestor directory.
It still looks doable [not necessarily pretty, but that's another issue].
