Bit offtopic.
Is there any logical reason why if, given fd is a connected, AF_INET,
SOCK_STREAM socket, and one does a write(fd, buffer, len); close(fd);
to the peer, over a rather slow network (read modem, satelite link, etc),
the data gets lost (the remote receives the disconnect before the last
packet). According to socket(7), even if SO_LINGER is not set, the data
is flushed in the background.
Is it Linux or TCP specific? Or some obvious techincal detail I'm missing?
Thanks, Dan.
