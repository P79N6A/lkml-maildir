actually, the round-robining for finer-grained timeslices should not
impact the sleep average at all, because the roundrobin is done while the
task is still _running_, ie. the sleep average does not get impacted.
Otherwise we'd have elevated priority of simple CPU-intensive
applications, which would be Bad.
The way the sleep-average is maintained is balanced very carefully in the
O(1) scheduler. There are three states a task can be in:
 - sleeping: the sleep average increases
 - running but not executing: the sleep average stagnates
 - executing on a CPU: the sleep average decreases
ie. in the roundrobin case the tasks will neither increase, nor decrease
their sleep average - they are in essence 'frozen'. The moment they get
scheduled on a CPU for execution, their sleep average starts to decrease
again. (and once they go to sleep, their sleep average increases.)
so whatever effect you are seeing, it must be something else.
