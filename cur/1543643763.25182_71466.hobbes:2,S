I get:
  rm -f include/asm
  ( cd include ; ln -sf asm-i386 asm)
  make -C scripts kconfig.tk
  make[1]: Entering directory `/usr/src/linux-2.4.18/scripts'

Did you unpack the kernel as root and now trying to configure the kernel
as a normal user?  The error is stating the equivelent that the directory
`/usr/src/linux-2.4.18/scripts' is not there (make was trying to cd into
it).  So I assume you either deleted the directory or you don't have
access to it.
