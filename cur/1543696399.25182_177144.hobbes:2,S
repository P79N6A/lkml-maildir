I tested this driver for my Nforce2 mobo on 2.6.0-test9, and this driver
seemed useless, it just printed some random numbers in my konsole (And
trust me, it was hard to edit lilo.conf so I even could boot back to old
kernel when all the numbers just were jumping around) And it broke the
other card too, ifconfig was right, now there was this card too, but no
one from them worked. Thanks anyway.
