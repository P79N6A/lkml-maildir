I'm guessing something on those lines yes, I doubt it's purerely in core
overhead that makes that much difference. Just for completeness, I never
read this in literature or data sheets, this is all out of pratical
experience, so we can't exclude something odd in the scsi layer, but I
very much doubt, the only thing that might explain it is to waste cpu
and we know it's not wasting it.
