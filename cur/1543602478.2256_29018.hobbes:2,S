   Here are kumon's test results from March, with and without
   the hashed lock patch:
Please elaborate on what the webbench-3.0 static gets was
really doing.
Was this test composed of multiple accesses to the same or a small set
of files?  If so, that is indeed the case where the page cache locking
patches won't help at all.
The more diversified the set of files being accessed, the greater the
gain from the locking changes.  You have to encourage the cpus at
least have a chance at accessing different hash chains :-)
Franks a lot,
