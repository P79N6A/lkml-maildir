Earlier I had a patch lined up that checked the previous number of tracks 
against the current number and only freed the TOC array when they were not 
the same. The majority case is a data CD with one TOC entry meaning we just 
reuse the entry. You then have to keep the previous number of tracks though 
and it seemed a little pointless so I dropped it.
Another option is using a linked list for the TOC and reusing or allocating 
nodes upon reading the actual entry from the Q channel and freeing the rest 
when we got them all. Also seemed overly complex and the CDROMREADTOCENTRY 
gets slower ;-)
I admit my DOS inspired dislike of realloc() is largely pointless these days 
but, err... "E426: tag not found: krealloc". Would you perhaps like the 
list? Or the if (tracks != mcd->tracks) thing?
Rene.
