I don't know what board you have, but my abit BP6 improved with more
cooling
(better fans on the cpu's and a fan on another hot chip that only had a 
heatsink before.)  And use thermal grease instead of the cleaner but
inferior 
rubber pads.
Lower clock frequency tends to help too, but nobody wants that. ;-)
