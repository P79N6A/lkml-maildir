I don't think I am. I think we just define "caching" differently. The "raw 
transfer bandwidth" will be close to zero if no caching happens at all. I 
agree with you if you define caching as data caching. But both Peter and I 
are talking about metadata caching + data caching. Sure, you can throw data 
caching out the window and actually gain performance. I would never dispute 
that. But if you throw away metadata caching you destroy performance. Maybe 
not on "simplistic" file systems like ext2 but certainly so on complex ones 
like ntfs... I described already what a single read in ntfs entails if no 
metadata caching happens. I doubt very much that there is a possible 
scenario where not doing any metadata caching would improve performance (on 
ntfs and at a guess many other fs). Even a sequential read or write from 
start of file to end of file would be really killed without caching of the 
logical to physical block mapping table for the inode being read/written on 
ntfs...
So we aren't in disagreement I think. (-:
