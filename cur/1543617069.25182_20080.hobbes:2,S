That's completely bogus.
The good news is that the bit-for-bit representation of old kdev_t and
"dev_t" are obviously 100% the same, so we should just make the damn thing
be dev_t, and user land will never notice anything.
So we can just change all structures that are exported to user land to use
"dev_t", and add the required conversion magic. Possibly by duplicating
the structure, and having "used_lvm_struct_x" and functions to read and
write them from/to user space.

Consider that done. ANYTHING that exports kdev_t to user space is
incredibly broken, and will not work in a few months when the actual bit
representation (and size) will change.
Do we have any lvm people willing to fix this? (linux-lvm cc'd, but I know
they've been very silent on the 2.5.x changes so far)
