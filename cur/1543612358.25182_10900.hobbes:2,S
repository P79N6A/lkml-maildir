This is more difficult that it sounds.  Section 4 of the Battery-Powered 
mini HOWTO (which is a bit out of date) has some useful advice.  You are 
doing it right...but something is touching the filesystem (or swap) on 
the drive.  It would be nice if there would be some way of enabling 
logging to say what process touched the filesystem.  Of course the 
logging itself would touch the filesystem (on a laptop :)).
