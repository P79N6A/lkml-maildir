I tried to start downloading without squid working. I started downloading
something big(Mozilla 0.7) to see what happends. The transfer hanged, but
this time, it did not take the rest of the system with it. the system
functioned just fine, but it did not recieve nor transmitted in/from the
eth0 device(even ping didn't work).
The greed LED in both the hub and the NIC suggested that the connection
was just fine.
ifconfig eth0 down
ifconfig eth0 up
brought the host back to the net, so it seems the NIC driver has to do
with the hangs somehow
(and indeed, the boot message suggest something which has to do with
"receiver lock-up bug workaround").
