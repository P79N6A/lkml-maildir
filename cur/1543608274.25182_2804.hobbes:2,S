IMHO, that is a good idea... almost.
What about companies that maintain closed source driver modules for their 
hardware?
I know a lot of people here will say, 'well they should open source them 
then'. However, some companies don't want to for their own reasons and 
this 'could' blow them out the water a bit and affect end users.
>From a stability point of view, this may seem like an excellent idea. I'm 
just scared that this could put companies off producing driver modules for 
their hardware.
