Well the get_block equivalent API is extent based one now, and I'll
look at what is required in making map_fsblock a more generic call
that could be used for an extent-based scheme.
An extent based thing IMO really isn't appropriate as the main generic
layer here though. If it is really useful and popular, then it could
be turned into generic code and sit along side fsblock or underneath
fsblock...
It definitely isn't trivial to drive the IO directly from something
like that which doesn't correspond to filesystem block size. Splitting
parts of your extent tree when things go dirty or uptodate or partially
under IO, etc.. joining things back up again when they are mergable.
Not that it would be impossible, but it would be a lot more heavyweight
than fsblock.
I think using fsblock to drive the IO and keep the pagecache flags
uptodate and using a btree in the filesystem to manage extents of block
allocations wouldn't be a bad idea though. Do any filesystems actually
do this?
