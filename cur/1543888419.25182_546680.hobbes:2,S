ah, great - i was looking over your debug data and couldnt find the 
problem! This moves CFS into the "no open regressions" state again ;-)

if that lag still occurs with rc2 then please repeat the following 
debugging steps under CFS [which has more instrumentation than the stock 
scheduler]:
  cat /proc/`pidof firefox-bin`/sched > sched1.txt
  echo 0 > /proc/`pidof firefox-bin`/sched
  < reproduce the lag in firefox >
  cat /proc/`pidof firefox-bin`/sched > sched2.txt
this way we'll be able to tell what nature this delay has. Also, could 
you send me your kernel's .config (off-list)?
