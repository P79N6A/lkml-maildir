This is already possible.
You can do:
make -C $KERNEL_SRC SUBDIRS=$PWD O=output-dir modules
or with my proposed syntax:
make -C $KERNEL_SRC M=$PWD O=output-dir
The files relevant for the module will be located in the $PWD dir, since
they use absolute paths.

I do not want to have potentially distro specific solutions.
So it depends if we can find a solution that most will agree on.
