How about this:
Let's let Kristian continue to work with his chosen fw_ prefix until his
drivers are ready to be pulled in (into the linux1394 repo and -mm),
then make a decision about prefixes. It's mostly a matter of running sed
over the files.
One thing is for sure, the fw_ prefix is not too well suited to stay
if/when Kristian's code is pushed to mainline. During a switch period,
we could e.g. replace the old stack's prefixes by hpsb1_ (as the 1st
generation of FireWire kernel APIs) or whatever and replace Kristian's
prefixes by hpsb_. I would actually like fw_ most (if it wasn't so
overloaded and already used in other contexts) and the author's decision
should be honored too.
Regarding the directory name, I favor to stick everything into
drivers/ieee1394 even if it could get crowded during a transition period.
