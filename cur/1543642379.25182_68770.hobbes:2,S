Separately compiled acenic..
I'm surprised by this profile a bit too - on the client side,
since the requests are small, and the client is receiving
all those files, I would have thought that __generic_copy_to_user
would have been way higher than *from_user.
inet_bind() and tcp_v4_get_port() are up there because
we have to grab the socket lock, the tcp_portalloc_lock,
then the head chain lock and traverse the hash table
which has now many hundred entries. Also, because
of the varied length of the connections, the clients
get freed not in the same order they are allocated
a port, hence the fragmentation of the port space..
Tthere is some cacheline thrashing hurting the NUMA 
more than other systems here too..
If you just wanted to speed things up, you could get the
clients to specify ports instead of letting the kernel
cycle through for a free port..:)
thanks,
