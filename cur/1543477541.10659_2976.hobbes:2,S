Heck, you would need to send a CD with the press release to make an
accurate representation of the attitudes that I've seen.  Maybe an
"electronic press release," a screen shot, or something more
interactive, sort of like those old "demo" versions of software that
commercial places sent out... but Linux has the distribution right
there on the 'Net, too!
Btw: Don't worry too much about the offtopic, above, some of the
techies don't like reading about non-kernel stuff topics, and this way
they can filter it out.
