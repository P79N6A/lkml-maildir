We could chance the partition table to hold a name for each partition. Look:
[root@localhost linux]# /sbin/pdisk /dev/sda
Edit /dev/sda -
Command (? for help): p
Partition map (with 512 byte blocks) on '/dev/sda'

So we could access the disk via /disk/<name> instead of /dev/sdxyy. /disk/
should be something virtual like /proc, but I don't know if it can be done.

Is it possible to use 32 minors-per-disk instead of 16 ?  32 should be enough
for anyone :)
