  After all the earlier difficulties booting off scsi disk I am delighted to report
  that it worked with ac6. 
  I must confess I did change one thing and that was to turn off SMP and turn on 
  IO-APIC for UP. I dont know if this is related or not as I have not tried 
  going back the other way.  The box in question is a single CPU machine (dell xps-t).  
  I also note that this version includes 6.1.11 of the aicxxx driver. 
  Thanks!
  regards,
