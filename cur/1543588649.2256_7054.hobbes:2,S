thanks for calling me a freak :)
yes, linux could have posix timers cobbled on today and comply with the POSIX
spec.
but, we would like to make it better, not just feature complete.
10ms timer resolutions, while completely in compliance w/ the posix spec, are
completely useless for "RT freaks" 
remember that 95% of all computers in the world are embedded and of those most
nead at least "soft" RT behavior.  seems like a good growth market for linux to
me.
when a PPC G4 is capable of 30 nanosecond resolution, why would you want to
settle for 10 millisecond  (30 billionths of a second vs 10 thousandths for
those of you who haven't had to familiarize yourselves with sub-second time
units)
