When trying to build SCSI support into 2.6.0-test5, 
I configure SCSI, but
whether I configure NO driver at all
or configure the aic7xxx driver
when I get to the 
    make install
I constantly get the error message  
    No module aic7xxx found for kernel 2.6.0-test5, aborting.
Surely SOMEONE has built this kernel with SCSI support, 
so why is it giving me this trouble.
I can probably build w/o ANY SCSI support at all, but that wouldnt be
useful, so I havent tried...
