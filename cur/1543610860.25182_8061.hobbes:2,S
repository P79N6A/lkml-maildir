In the case of these traces, it appears that the bus is not up to
snuff for the negotiated speed.  We're in data-out phase, our DMA
engine is enabled, our FIFO is full of data to send, but the target
has not requested any more data.  This means that either the controller
missed a REQ or the target missed an ACK.  I would verify your cabling
and termination.

I'd need to see the logs to know for sure that what you are seeing
is the same as Cristian.
