This message pops up in my logs countless times, often accompanied by
temporarily freezes of the system, and pops in the sound.  It seems to
occur more often when under load, i.e. playing a DVD.  In fact, they
degrade the performance so badly as to make DVDs unwatchable.
I would chock this up to crappy hardware, accept that these errors don't
occur with the ALSA drivers, even under the same situations.  Not just
the absense of the messages, but the absense of the symptoms.
Thanks
