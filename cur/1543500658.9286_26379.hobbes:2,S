it would reduce the cpu load apache puts on the system when we hit the 2.2
network stack ceiling in this (contrived) environment, but remember that
zeus hit this same ceiling while serving multiple connections / process.  
the non O(1) scheduler didn't help things, but it certainly wasn't _the_
limiting factor.
the network stack has been cleaned up, apache is being hacked to bits, all
is well in the universe :)
