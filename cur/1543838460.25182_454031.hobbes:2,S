Subject: [PATCH 5/7] pid: Implement pid_nr
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

As we stop storing pid_t's and move to storing struct pid *.  We
need a way to get the pid_t from the struct pid to report to user
space what we have stored.
Having a clean well defined way to do this is especially important
as we move to multiple pid spaces as may need to report a different
value to the caller depending on which pid space the caller is in.
