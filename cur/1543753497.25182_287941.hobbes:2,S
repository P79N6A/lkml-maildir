Sure. And we don't need a special HWDEV variable, as there is already a 
PHYSDEVPATH variable providing exactly this information.
I'm not too happy about this 'inputX' thing (as this doesn't carry any 
information, whereas 'phys' gives you at least a rough guess what this 
device's about), but if phys is to go it would be the logical choice.

Yes, topology is not an issue when loading modules.
