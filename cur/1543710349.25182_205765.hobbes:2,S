It's got nothing to do with visual scanning.  It's more to do with 
grammatical form i.e. we (especially English speakers) like the form: 
subject (foo) verb (==) object (0); and in these cases the variable 
(foo) is the indisputable subject (i.e. the thing the sentence is about) 
but (0 == foo) momentarily causes us to think that 0 is the subject and 
we find this disconcerting.  On the other hand, Yoda (the Jedi master) 
would probably prefer: (0 foo ==) :-)
Like most matters of style there are points for and against both methods 
  and eventually someone has to make a (relatively arbitrary) decision. 
  Linus has made the decision and it's his call so we should abide by it 
(especially since he made it pretty clear that he was aware of (and 
considered) all the relevant arguments and is therefore unlikely to 
change his mind).

PS It's important not to get too emotionally attached to a particular 
method or style because there's always a chance that whoever gets to 
decide which will be used may not choose the one you like.  This time 
you lucked in :-)
