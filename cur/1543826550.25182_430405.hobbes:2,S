Hi,
We still experience the NFS client slow down reported by Jakob
Østergaard in 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/3/31/82,
 even with 2.6.17-rc6.
Trond Myklebust have created a patch which we have verified solves this
problem for 2.6.16, 2.6.17-rc4 and 2.6.17-rc6. The patch is available
from 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/4/24/320,
 and as an attachment to
bugzilla bug 6557.
