Ugh.  Okay, I need to rework the changes to that function.

I would have thought so, but -EACCES was what it returned before I touched it.
OTOH, it's calling ext3_error(), so EIO ought to be the right thing to do.
I'll alter it and see if anyone complains.

I do wonder why it used to return EINVAL rather than EIO.  It's understandable
if the magic number doesn't match, but if it appears to be an otherwise
corrupt filesystem, then yes, I guess it should return EIO.  I'll change it.
