...
P.S.
Anyone know of a tcpdump which can really deal with isdn rawip?
P.P.S
if tcpdump -lnti ippp0 -s 128 is not right, holler and I'll redo.
ippp0  is syncppp not rawip, or I'm wrong ?
SuSE tcpdump works OK with isdn, but so far I remember the
encap decoding depends (hardcoded) on interface names:
ipppX  - syncppp
isdnX  - rawip
