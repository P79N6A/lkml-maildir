It can be generally useful. Until/unless we get proper screen support,
how do you know hang from panic? If you can talk to some other
device it would help.

The patch makes sense. You don't need to poll every jiffie to find
out if system has panic.  But I agree with Linus, it is the kind
of patch that doesn't belong in the mainline kernel.  Every developer
seems to have built up a set of crappy/fragile debug tools, but these
don't belong in the wild.
