The US military's solution to your problem was solved with the
successful rolling out of the F4 Fantom fighter. The plane was
essentially a large block of metal, with a few advantagously aerodynamic
surfaces, and big f****** engines. If you had engine trouble in a Fantom
...you had trouble. By this method of doing things, all we need to do,
is simply have everyone run dual proc. G4's and PPC linux ....umm no.
Nothing agains the G4's (I'd love to have one) but this is not a
solution. Something more graceful must be come up with. I don't think
that "Real-Time" is the answer, and besides, I'm not sure that would
help beyond a certain point. After all, CPU's are truely not the
limiting factor in most PC's these days, its the bus, and the things
attached. Sure, some help is on the way with DDR chipsets for AMD cpu's,
but what about storage? Our current hard drives are not the solution.
More data must be able to be passed faster, and somewhere in there, we
have to leave a way for the system (and software!) to respond to
requests from the user even while in the midst of this rush. Efficient
prioritizing, and resource management is the answer to this, not
"Real-Time". Unfortunately, as easy as it is to say this, it will be
much harder to make a reality.
