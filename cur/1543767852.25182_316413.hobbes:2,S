In some cases, the kernel is less lines of better-understood code.. :)
Current Fedora-devel tree:
-rw-rw-r--    1 33474781   Mar 31 00:09   thunderbird-1.0.2-1.src.rpm
-rw-r--r--    1 42109198   May  4 18:52   kernel-2.6.11-1.1286_FC4.src.rpm
(And the kernel doesn't drag in Xorg and Gnome libraries on top of that like
thunderbird does)....
