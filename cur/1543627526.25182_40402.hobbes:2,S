Simple question but hopefully it has a simple answer.. is there a command
you can issue or flag you can look for from the output of hdparm to tell if
your hard drive is capable of TCQ before installing the patch? I have a few
IBM drives that I'm sure have TCQ abilities but I don't trust them as far as
I can throw them (being Hungarian and cursed) but I'd like to give TCQ a
whirl on my WD 120GB drives that should work OK, if they support TCQ..
Sorry if it's already been asked.. :)
