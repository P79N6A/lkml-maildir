Yes, it is fine to schedule after release_task(). As Eric pointed out, we
don't race with call_rcu(delayed_put_task_struct), scheduler has another
reference
	dup_task_struct:
		/* One for us, one for whoever does the "release_task()" (usually parent) */
		atomic_set(&tsk->usage,2);
However, with CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU we do have the problem here, but this is
off-topic. Preemption is fine, but deactivate_task() is not. We can't migrate
the deactivated released task from the dead CPU.
	migrate_live_tasks() can't find the task after __unhash_process()
	migrate_dead_tasks() doesn't see it after deactivate_task().
And afaics try_to_wake_up() doesn't necessary change task_cpu() if it is
offline.
No? But again, this is offtopic even if I am right.
Oleg.
