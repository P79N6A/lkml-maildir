   egcs-2.91.66 indeed doesn't seem to make this optimization on i386.
   (Maybe the pointer increment or pointer offset solution would
   actually be slower - didn't check.) But I'm not sure if this is
   also true for other versions/architectures, or other code
   constructs.
There is no guarentee that contiguous data or bss section members
will appear contiguous and in the same order, in the final object.
In fact, a specific optimization done on MIPS and other platforms is
to place all data members under a certain size in a special
".small.data" section.  So for example:
static int a;
static struct foo b;
static int b;
Would not place 'b' at "&a + sizeof(a) + sizeof(b)"
Also I believe linkers are allowed to arbitrarily reorder members in
the data and bss sections.  I could be wrong on this one though.
