IIRC this looks more or less what Peter had initially. I don't like the 
API because there's no way for slab (perhaps this is different for slub) 
how many pages you really need due to per-node and per-cpu caches, etc.
It's better that the slab tells you what it actually knows and lets the 
callers figure out what a worst-case upper bound is.
