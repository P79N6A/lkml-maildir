Ok, I only named HAL as that is what people have told me the problem is.
I have been running this change on my boxs, without
CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED since last July or so.
But I don't use NetworkManager here for the most part, but I have tried
this in the OpenSuse10.3 alpha releases and it seems to work just fine
with whatever version of NetworkManager it uses.
So perhaps it's some wrapper scripts somewhere?  I think SuSE had some
odd things hard coded somewhere that prevented 10.1 from working
properly with this change.
Ok, so I'll drop the HAL wording above, what should I say instead?
thanks,
