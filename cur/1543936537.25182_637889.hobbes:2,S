Subject: [PATCH 002 of 6] md: Fix use-after-free bug when dropping an rdev from an md array.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Due to possible deadlock issues we need to use a schedule work to
kobject_del an 'rdev' object from a different thread.
A recent change means that kobject_add no longer gets a refernce, and
kobject_del doesn't put a reference.  Consequently, we need to
explicitly hold a reference to ensure that the last reference isn't
dropped before the scheduled work get a chance to call kobject_del.
Also, rename delayed_delete to md_delayed_delete to that it is more
obvious in a stack trace which code is to blame.
