Got it. The comment was

I'm not sure I agree with that though. We need access to irq_set_affinity()
from the cpuset code. It does not seem to make sense to call some arch
specific code if that functionality is provided by the generic layer.
Also note that IRQ functionality in the cpuset is ifdefed by the
CONFIG_GENERIC_HARDIRQS, so that we guarantied to have access to the generic code.
In addition to the irq_set_affinity we need irq_iterator() which is added by
the patch. Which again is generic.
So the question is why would we want to call into an arch interface if we can
call the generic one directly ?
