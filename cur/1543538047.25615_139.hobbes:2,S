Can you give list a setup, or setups, that can be used to show low
latency for specific usage cases?
I'm concerned that the latencies you are seeing, in some cases, may
be due to the fault of the sound driver not the inherent slowness of
the operating system.
I'm a linux kernel folk, and I've got some test hardware, now I'm
waiting for the rhetoric to die down and the real info to start
flowing.  :)
