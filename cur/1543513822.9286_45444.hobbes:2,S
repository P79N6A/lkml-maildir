Don't forget that Windows is essentially DOS.  When you boot in
MS-DOS mode, you have the system that Windows bootstraps itself
with.

Linux fdisk will only let you break these rules in expert mode.

Really?!?!  I'd imagine the DOS MBR code uses the CHS locations of
partitions to determine where to find the boot sector.  If what you
said is true, a hard disk that can bootstrap on one machine can't
on another.
I guess I should check if the DOS/Windows MBR uses LBA or CHS to
find the boot sector.

Don't hard drives have a defined number of heads, and a defined number
of tracks per head, and sectors per track?  Even if software can't
determine it, it is defined.

If the hard disk doesn't have a geometry defined by the BIOS, then
Linux can't get it.  But then, DOS can't either.  So what on earth
does DOS do, (assuming it's using CHS, not LBA)?

Could you use the v3.0 BIOS standard's interface and device
path, mentioned in Ralf Brown's intlist?

I've had bug reports where users have had disks with < 255 heads.

Perhaps, but I'd also like DOS/Windows to boot.  In this case,
`right' is defined as allows DOS to boot, and access the disk
properly.  Linux uses the LBA entries in the partition table
only, so there's no issue for Linux.

What if it's a fresh disk, where the user installs Linux first?

How's the user supposed to know?  I guess they can get it from
the BIOS, so this solution is usable, but a nicer one is
preferable.

I'm beginning to agree.  With Win95, you can just use LBA partitions,
and Win95 ignores the CHS (I just tested it).  If anyone's using
DOS still, then their computer is so ancient it won't have the new
BIOS stuff anyway, so it won't make a difference.

Why?
Anyway, it seems the solution is to always write out partition tables
with LBA partitions, not CHS.  It seems we don't need to care about
aligning partitions to cylinder boundaries, so there's no need for
geometry at all, for Windows 95 and up.
*BUT*, does anyone know if the Win 95 LBA partition type was
introduced in the original release?  If was 95 B that it was introduced,
then we could run into problems - I but there are a heap of systems
running the original Win 95.  I have a horrible suspicion it was
introduced in 95 B, because the FAT16 LBA partition number is larger
than the FAT32 one, implying it was conceived afterwards (perhaps).
FAT32 was 95 B.
In which case the problem can't be so easily swept aside...
