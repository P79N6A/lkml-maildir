Heinz wrote a utility called 'dmraid' which detects and activates 
various hardware fakeraid volumes using the kernel device mapper.  I'm 
using it at home to dual boot ubuntu and winxp ( just in case ) from a 
stripe of two WD 10,000 rpm raptors and it works great.  I'm still 
pushing to get it integrated into dapper.  At this time however, neither 
my hardware, nor dmraid support raid-5.  Hopefully this will change in 
the future.
