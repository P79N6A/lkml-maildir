The issue here is that this should really be a per-hba setting, and
as HBAs can appear anytime due to PCI hotplug a module paramater is not
enough.  Then again I still don't see why we need to spend so much effort
on this as you could trivially just fail the PD scanning commands in the
firmware without messing up the driver.

Same argument here about beeing per-hba.  And they really should be changeable
at runtime at least for hbas that don't have commands in flight.
