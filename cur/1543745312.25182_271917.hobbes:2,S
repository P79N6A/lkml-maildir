Subject: "power" file disappeared after powering down slot in 2.6.9 & 2.6.10-rc1

Using 2.6.9 and 2.6.10-rc1, I encountered the problem that doing 
"echo 0 > /sys/bus/pci/slots/X/power" or "using attention button" 
to power down slot caused the "power" file under /sys/bus/pci/slots/X/
to disappear. Actually, two other files under the same directory 
disappeared also. However, this problem was resolved in 2.6.10-rc2.
Looking at the changelog for 2.6.10-rc2, I saw there were a lot of 
changes related to sysfs.  Does anyone know what changes may have 
fixed this problem? Or, what might be the cause of the problem that 
I saw in 2.6.9 & 2.6.10-rc1?
Tracing back, I found that "disappearing of power file after powering 
down the slot" started to appear in 2.6.9-rc3 and lasted till
2.6.10-rc1.  
Before this kernel, it worked fine (in 2.6.9-rc2-mm4).  I found this 
problem when I used shpch & pciehp drivers and I would like to see if
anyone see this problem while using other hot-plug drivers.
Thanks,
Dely
