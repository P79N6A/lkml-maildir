Attached is a proposed patch for syncppp to make
the Cisco HDLC address selectable between multicast
and unicast, with the default being unicast.
New ioctl codes to set/get the syncppp flags (including
the new PP_MULTICAST) is also added.
The patch is against 2.2.14 and has been tested on the same.
If there are no objections and this patch is accepted, I will
do the same for 2.3.X.
