No, unless you want to make this const:
-static u8 window[0x8000]; /* use a statically allocated window */
+static u8 INITDATA window[0x8000]; /* use a statically allocated window */
It shouldn't be marked INITDATA either anyway - it's uninitialised so
it'll end up in the BSS.  There is no "discarded at runtime" BSS so
anything you want to place in a non-BSS section has to be initialised.
Of course, if you initialise it, you end up needlessly adding 32K to
the kernel image size...
