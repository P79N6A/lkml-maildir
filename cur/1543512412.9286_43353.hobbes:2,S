Subject: SYS-Req does not work.

I have a 2.2.11 kernel compiled with sysreq built in.  I'm using
a standard 101 key keyboard that works with everything no
problem.  (Brand/model == MTEK-K208).  Every time I've enabled
SYSRQ support, it has NEVER worked.  I'm assuming that this is
due to something with the keyboard, or a bug in the SYSRQ support
that only works with Microsoft keyboards, or IBM keyboards or
perfect clones.
What could cause SYSRQ to not be trapped?
Does SYSRQ support require something be enabled first at boot
time?  If so, then I'm guilty for not doing so...
Please advise.
Thanks in advance.
