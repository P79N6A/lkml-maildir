 you can read:
See prefetch section:
The Alpha 21264 initiates a prefetch operation by executing one of the load 
instructions as summarized in the table below. Note that the destination 
register is R31 or F31. When used as a source register, R31 and F31 return 
integer zero and floating point zero, respectively. When used as a 
destination register as shown below, R31 and F31 denote the purpose of 
these instructions as a prefetch operation. Earlier Alpha implementations 
ignore these instructions. Some care must be taken as a prefetch with an 
invalid address must be dismissed by firmware and a prefetch can cause an 
alignment trap.
