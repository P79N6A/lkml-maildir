I do not like interfaces accepting and encouraging writing garbage data. What
value sould be written into "unbind"? Yes, any junk.

But not 2 drivers with the same name on the same bus so I don't think this
is a valid argument. Anyway, we already have this symlink.

Does that imply that I can not rebind device while it is bound to a driver?
("bind" would be missing it seems). And what about all other flavors of that
operation - rescan, reconnect? Do we want to have separate attributes for
them as well?
