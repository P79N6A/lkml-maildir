SG_MAX_SENSE, yes? It's your bug if you are using that and using the
newer interface, it only applies to the old sg_header interface. As
scsi-linux-sg is using SG_IO, it has no relevance whatsoever. Internally
SCSI uses a much bigger sense buffer, so as long as you supply a big
enough user buffer it works.
A 1 minute grep of the sources could have told you this. I always get
the feeling that you'd rather see the bugs persist rather than have them
fixed, so you have more to complain about on Linux.

I haven't looked that far yet, I might next week. That your scgcheck
doesn't work without /dev/sg* means I can't check on ide-cd,
unfortunately.
