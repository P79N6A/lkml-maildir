The reason might be the same as for having freezable and nonfreezable kernel
threads in general.  For example, there are some kernel threads that we need
for saving the image and I don't see why there shouldn't be any such
workqueues.

In principle, we can, but for this purpose we'd have to modify all NOFREEZE
tasks.  That wouldn't fly, I'm afraid.

But we call _cpu_down() after device_suspend(), so many tasks are already
frozen at this point.  We'd only need to freeze those that are not frozen and
in _cpu_up() we'd have to thaw them.

We can't.
I think it would be a mistake to even try to remove all limitations from the
freezer.  Any other synchronization mechanisms have some limitations as well.
The code that uses these mechanisms is usually expected to use them in a sane
way and I don't see why we shouldn't expect the freezer users to do the same. ;-)

Yes, you're right.
