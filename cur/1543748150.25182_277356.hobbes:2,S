inodes are only added to the list (prior to superblock security
initialization, e.g. before initial policy load or during get_sb) by
inode_doinit_with_dentry, which in turn is called from
selinux_d_instantiate.  So if you've marked the inode private prior to
the d_instantiate call on it, and changed security_d_instantiate to not
call the security module for private inodes, how would a private inode
ever get into that list?
