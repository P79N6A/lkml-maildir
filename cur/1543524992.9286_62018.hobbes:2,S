	While trying to build pppd 2.3.11 with the kernel 2.3.41 include
files I ran into a conflict with the Linux include files.  This
conflict precludes building pppd 2.3.11.  The RLIM_INFINITY #define in
<2.3.41 kernel srcdir>/include/asm-i386/resource.h conflicts with
/usr/include/resourcebits.h (which I presume came with the gcc 2.7.2.3
distribution since that what my Debian 2.1 system has).  I scanned back
through the kernel patches and found that the RLIM_INFINITY got added
to the asm-i386/resource.h file in 2.3.32.
	It's easy enough to edit the resourcehits.h file to avoid the
conflict but that's not a long term solution.  I haven't figured out the
consequences of modifying the asm-i386/resource.h file, or actually all
the asm-*/resource.h files as they all have the #define in question.
