with some debugging help of Dmitry Torokhov and Jan Engelhardt I
could *not* find the cause why the PS/2 keyboard does not work.
But other things do work:
- If I connect the keyboard with the USB, it does work with 2.6.15.
- If I use another pc with an old AMD 500, the PS/2 keyboard does
work.
So, it could be a strange problem between the motherboard chipset
(nforce4), the 2.6.15 kernel and the PS/2 connection.
I am going to test some Kernels beetween 2.6.14.2 and 2.6.15 to find
the problem in some time.
