Cool, the issue was that I get tried of people blaming the ATA subsystem
for things that it does not do or has control over.  Basically, I kill
bogus threads that try to tag me with an old problem of the past that was
a hardware issue.
Given the latest stats that more than 90% of the linux install base is
hinged on me getting the low-level engine core correct, I go on benders
when cheap shots are take across the bow.
Now the only issue that is even on the radar map is a potential 1GB cross
copy execution where I have a single report that md5sums do not match.
I have yet to reproduce it even with the identical hardware sent to me.
I questioned _A_ about this and there may be a case that is OS independent
which is more important to me than other.  This is a non-fixable for
6->12 months, until I kick some tail in the standards committee meetings
over this point.  If it is a reality, Linux and Microsoft will join as the
OS's represented there and force the change.  Only because there are
potentical side-bars that NT is effected also in these rare cases.
Cheers,
