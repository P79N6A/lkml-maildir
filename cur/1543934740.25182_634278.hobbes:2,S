well you sent it via Kmail, which is notorious for not wanting to send 
proper plain-text patches. Yours was:
 Content-Type: text/plain;
   charset="utf-8"
 Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable
 Content-Disposition: inline
so i had to hand-apply it. There's a Kmail section in 
Documentation/email-clients.txt, please read it.
