Maybe my wording was ambiguous, I meant to reduce cache line pollution
when accessing these schedstat fields.
With unsigned long, on x86_64, schedstat consumes 288 bytes for each
sched_domain and 128 bytes in struct rq.  On a extremely small system
that has a couple of CPU sockets with one level of numa node, there
will be 704 bytes per CPU for schedstat.  Given the sparseness of
them, we are probably talking about 11-12 cache line eviction on
several heavily used scheduler functions.  Reduce cache line pollution
is the primary goal, actual memory consumption isn't really a concern.
