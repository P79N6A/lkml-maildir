[PATCH 0/3] A kernel tracing interface - (updated)
These patches provide a kernel tracing interface called "trace".
(update) Fixed a notation in the trace documentation as pointed out by
 Randy Dunlap.  Updated references to prerequisite patches.
The motivation for "trace" is to:
- Provide a simple set of tracing primitives that will utilize the high-
  performance and low-overhead of relayfs for passing traces data from
  kernel to user space.
- Provide a common user interface for managing kernel traces.
- Allow for binary as well as ascii trace data.
- Incorporate features from the systemtap runtime that are
  useful to others.
Patches are against 2.6.23-rc8-mm2
Summary of patches:
[patch 1/3]  Trace code and documentation
[patch 2/3]  Relay Reset Consumed
[patch 3/3]  Trace sample
Note: Patch 2/3 provides a service used by patch 1/3
thus must be applied first or at the same time.
Note: The following patches must be applied prior to 3/3.
[patch 3/5] Add samples subdir
