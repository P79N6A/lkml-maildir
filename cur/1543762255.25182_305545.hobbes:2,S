That's a good question, and one that's not easy to answer. Obviously, at the
moment there will only be that one user. I'm not sure that other users will
necessarily want to make use of it.
On the other hand, I can see the authorisation key bit being extended to
provide all of these things with access to the authorising process's keyrings,
whether or not they're constructing keys; but that can probably be made
transparent.
