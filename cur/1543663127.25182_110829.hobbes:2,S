I spent a little time looking at this weeks ago.  I compiled the file
-E to see what the pre-processor was doing.  I then tried to compile
the pre-processed file and the warning went away.  So, it looks to me
like some kind of compiler error with the way it pre-processes files
(at that point the problem got a lot less interesting ;-).
