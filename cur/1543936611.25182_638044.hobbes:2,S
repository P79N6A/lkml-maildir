Hi Len,
in two cases you just introduce the 'warned' variable but do not set
them to '1' after the printk() which is the intetion to print it just
one time. Namely in pnpacpi_parse_allocated_ioresource() and
pnpacpi_parse_allocated_memresource() the 'warned = 1' is missing.

Even if it will vanish in 2.6.25 you should fix this new introduced
code. :-)
