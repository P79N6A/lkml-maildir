Funny, I encountered this problem on two Computers having an SIS
K7S5A[PRO] mainboard on
Linux zappa 2.6.10-rc1-mm5 #2 Sat Nov 13 17:17:40 CET 2004 i686
GNU/Linux
0000:00:00.0 Host bridge: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] 735 Host (rev
01)
0000:00:01.0 PCI bridge: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] Virtual
PCI-to-PCI bridge (AGP)
0000:00:02.0 ISA bridge: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] SiS85C503/5513
(LPC Bridge)

goes not down.
