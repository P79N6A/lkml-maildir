From my discussions with the vtune people, their kernel-level stuff has
almost exactly the same needs as oprofile. So I think they have
everything they need already (and I had to go to the effort of a total
rewrite, I think they should as well ...)
In fact I don't see a reason why they couldn't just use the oprofile
code directly anyway, and just have the propietary goop read from
/dev/oprofile/buffer. Especially if that encourages them to port the
PEBS support etc.
