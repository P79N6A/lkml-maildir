Good suggestion!  It took care of the problems reported
by depmod.  Only "minor" issue is that it can't mount my
root file system on my (ultra wide) SCSI disk 0:8.  From
what I can see it has SCSI compiled into the kernel.  
Do you have suggestions for this as well?
thx,

You have a mismatch between the running kernel and the modules.  It
normally indicates human error such as forgetting to install the new
kernel, forgetting to install the new modules, forgetting to update
lilo (or other boot loader) to point to the new kernel.
MEC has suggested that there might be a bug in the Makefiles when
changing from UP to SMP.  If so, the solution is -
save .config,
make mrproper,
restore .config,
make oldconfig,
make dep clean bzImage modules,
install new kernel and modules,
update boot loader,
reboot.
