RLIMIT_STACK only applies to the initial thread, POSIX threads have just
stack size attribute, not maximum thread stack size attribute.
If you set it explicitly with pthread_attr_setstacksize, then libpthread
will honor whatever thread stack size you want, otherwise it just uses
some default thread stack size.  This happens to be in NPTL derived
from RLIMIT_STACK value, but very well could be something else.
