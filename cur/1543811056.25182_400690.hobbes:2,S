I'm sure Trond's testcase is much more useful, but for reference, I 
thought I'd add that I've been doing my testing with a simple "dd 
if=/nfsmount/file of=/dev/null bs=32k".  /nfsmount/file is usually 2.5-3 
GB, which makes the difference between NFS servers long enough that I 
feel safe throwing a "time" in front of the whole command.  That is, the 
difference is nowhere near millisecond resolution (it's nearer a 
minute), so I like to start the test and then walk away to do other things.
Interesting that it's not an NFS-only bug.  I assumed it was when I 
logged into each server so I could run "dd if=file of=/dev/null bs=32k" 
locally.  When I did that, both servers gave roughly the same speed.  
Sorry I left this bit out of my first email.  I assume this example only 
illustrates how opaque the code around this problem truly is.
Thanks very much for the help.
