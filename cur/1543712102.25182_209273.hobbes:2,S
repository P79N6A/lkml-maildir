Nope. Not broken. I used it yesterday in testing some changes you
suggested. I asked about removing it a while back and people said 'No!
We're using it!"

How? It would need to know the drive throughput, the compression
throughput for each driver... I'm sure you're not suggesting some sort
of utility run during kernel configuration/compilation. (And if you
were, that would assume the computer it was being compiled on was the
computer the kernel would be run on).

Feature freeze is always half unfrozen anyway. 2.4 just gained XFS! I'm
sure 2.6 would be fine gaining a permutation of suspend with Highmem
support, swap file support, support for multiple swap devices, support
for bootsplash, support for compression and/or encryption and support
for SMP/HT. (Did I forget anything? :>).
