Subject: INITRD - linuxrc does not find executables???

I am trying to use initrd.  I have copied a few executables like ls,
mount etc. to the bin directory in the initrd - disk. Upon booting
although linuxrc gets executed it does not find the executables.
I have tried setting path variable in linuxrc too.  Has anyone seen
this problem and what is the solution?
I am able to use echo to print to console - although I have not
copied it to the initial ram disk.
I am using kernel version 2.0.36 with Redhat 5.2.
Thanks,
gita.
