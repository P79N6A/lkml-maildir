  I have to agree that requiring the correct part for memory is not
usually considered a "hardware issue" as most people see it.
  I believe the VIA chipsets have similar features, the last m/b I
installed said it supported 4 DIMMs, up to 3GB. So a 1GB part will work,
but if you put in four only three operate (I didn't have four to try).
