Tthis means that one, unmodified source tree is _not_ usable for multiple 
architectures. You can't use the same, prepared sources and for example 
create noarch.rpm or burn on cd and then use for external modules building on 
different architectures.
We are using this:
http://cvs.pld-linux.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/SOURCES/linux-kbuild-extmod.patch?rev=1.2
to get external modules working for multiple archs with the same sources:
