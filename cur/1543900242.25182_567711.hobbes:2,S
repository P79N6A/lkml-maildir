It is forward & backward compatible to enable COMPAT_CHECKSUM.  That just
means the commit blocks will have checksums in them, but older kernels
will just ignore them.  Hmm, I suppose there might be an issue with "upgrade,
downgrade, upgrade" in that the commit blocks would not have checksums
even though the superblock says they will...
Does that mean we should accept a checksum == 0 as being valid (which
is not very nice, given that 0 is an oft-hit bad value), or that we need
a flag in every commit block which indicates if it actually has a checksum?
The INCOMPAT_ASYNC_COMMIT can't be handled safely by older kernels, since
they would assume "commit block == complete transaction", which isn't
true if the commit block didn't wait for the rest of the blocks to make
it to the disk.
I don't think e2fsck can be used to individually clean up the feature flags,
but it is always possible to remove and recreate the journal...

Well, we aren't using the rest of the commit block in any case.  I think
the original intention was that we'd get 8 copies of the commit block so
we would be sure to get a good one.
I don't know whether we'd rather have 8 copies of the commit block, or
more potential to expand the commit block?  I don't personally have any
preference, since the checksum should be a more robust way of checking
validity than having multiple copies, so we may as well remove the loop
and stick with a single copy for now.

Since the checksum is saved to disk, it seems more appropriate to use __u32
or maybe even __be32, though I'm not sure if the crc32 functions do that
correctly or not.
