We support I2O_BSA_CACHE_FLUSH, which is the i2o spec definition of this
identifier. It is merely internally re-issued as a SCSI
SYNCHRONIZE_CACHE command issued to the block device TID.

The dpt_i2o driver is a *SCSI* driver, and the card accepts SCSI
commands to all the devices (including block). The dpt_i2o driver uses
the SCSI synchronize as the path for this action, that is why you see no
utilization of I2O_BSA_CACHE_FLUSH.
A DPT private message is used to issue these SCSI commands to the
controller.
