Hi *,
Attached you will find a patch which adds support for CS89x0 base PCMCIA
cards such as the IBM EtherJet. The code is based on the existing CS89x0
driver. Tests where done on an IBM A20m with the IBM EtherJet card.
Future improvements include better integration with the non PCMCIA CS89x0
code and patches for other cards based on the same chipset.
Cheers,
Peter.
