Not for GCC it isn't.  Our standards say that a compiler crash, for any
input whatsoever, no matter how invalid (even if you feed in line noise),
is a bug.  Other than that we shouldn't make promises, though the old gcc1
behavior of trying to launch a game of rogue or hack when encountering a
#pragma was cute.
