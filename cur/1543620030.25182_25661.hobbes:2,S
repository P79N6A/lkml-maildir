Probably it doesn't, but just having the cpu be non-idle when it could
otherwise be idle does add up over time.  In linux, polling the cdrom
*seems* inexpensive enough, but if you look at 'top' it seems to average
out to like 1-2% cpu time!  (Ok, these stats aren't super-accurate,
they're just from running 'top' with the kde autorun tool running).
[Admitedly, the autorun tool is written kind of strangely (it does one
redundant ioctl, plus it wait()s on its children constantly rather than
installing a signal handler), but still.. it would be nice to get those
extra cycles for quake3 or wolfenstein...]
