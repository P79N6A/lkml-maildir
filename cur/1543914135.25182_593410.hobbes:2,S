Just to clear things up: yes, at the moment v86d supports only
x86 and amd64 (aka x86_64) and yes, supporting other arches is
possible and planned.  The main limiting factors as far as this
is concerned are the little amount of my free time and the fact
that I don't currently have access to non-x86 hardware.
Please note that the kernel part (i.e. uvesafb) is meant to be
generic (it currently uses VGA IO ports on non-x86, which is a
bug and for which a patch will follow) and support or lack thereof
for a specific arch should be dependent on v86d only.
That being said, I think that having a kernel dependency 
tracking the development status of userspace code is generally
a bad idea.
Best regards,
