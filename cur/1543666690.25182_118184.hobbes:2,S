Hi,
we also sometimes see those messages. In our case it seems to appears rather 
often for the local/share/perl directory of our /usr/local directory:
nfsd-fh: found a name that I didn't expect: share/perl
This directory is certainly never deleted when this message appears, actually 
data are very, very seldem written to it.
Once this message also appeared for a file:
servicetypes/kdeveloplanguagesupport.desktop
I can't tell you how often kde deletes this file.
Please ask if you need more information.
Bernd
