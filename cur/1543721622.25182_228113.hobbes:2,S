Kind people,
I believe this bug has been reported previously, but I will risk
repetition. (c.f. 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2004/5/22/124
 and
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0404.0/0736.html
)
Partial hardware list:
Athlon 950
00:00.0 Host bridge: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] 730 Host (rev 02)
00:0e.0 RAID bus controller: CMD Technology Inc: Unknown device 3112 (rev 02)
00:0f.0 Multimedia video controller: Brooktree Corporation Bt878 Video Capture (rev 11)
00:0f.1 Multimedia controller: Brooktree Corporation Bt878 Audio Capture (rev 11)
I mention the bttv card, since it generates a lot of PCI traffic and
may tax the system a bit.
Under kernels 2.6.6-mm5 and 2.6.7, I get the following errors after a
few hours or days (no obvious trigger or pattern), which hang most of
the machine (Alt-SysRq still works, machine still pings, but shells
and sshd2 freeze):
----------------------------
ata1: DMA timeout, stat 0x1
ATA: abnormal status 0x58 on port 0xCF819087
scsi0: ERROR on channel 0, id 0, lun 0, CDB: Read (10) 00 00 03 ca 47 00 00 00 00
Current sda: sense key Medium Error
Additional sense: Unrecovered read error - auto reallocate failed
end_request: I/O error, dev sda, sector 248391
ATA: abnormal status 0x58 on port 0xCF819087
ATA: abnormal status 0x58 on port 0xCF819087
ATA: abnormal status 0x58 on port 0xCF819087
----------------------------
Reiserfsck and badblocks both report that everything is just ducky
(though reiserfs replays some transactions on reboot, of course). The
freeze has happened about half a dozen times so far.
I am willing to test patches and report back.  I will try moving the
SATA card to another slot in the meantime (as it was sharing an
interrupt with an (idle) audio card).
