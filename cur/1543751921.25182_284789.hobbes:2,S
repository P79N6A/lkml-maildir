Subject: High load with adaptec scsi cards?

I'm using 2.6.10 with 3 adaptec scsi cards.  All 3 cards (onboard aic78xx
chip 2ch, aha-2940u/uw, aha-39160) that I use have this same problem.  When
I do heavy I/O to any disk, the load goes way up and the cpu usage goes to
100%
Top shows:
Cpu0  :  0.7% us,  7.3% sy,  0.0% ni,  2.7% id, 87.0% wa,  0.0% hi,  2.3% si
Cpu1  :  0.0% us,  0.0% sy,  0.0% ni, 97.7% id,  2.3% wa,  0.0% hi,  0.0% si
however, I do not see any program using all the cpu time int he process
list.  The program doing all the disk I/O uses ~8% cpu.
