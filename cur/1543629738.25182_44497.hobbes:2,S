Run the 57 patch, and complain if something doesn't work.
Linux's power is that we FIX stuff. That we make it the best system
possible, and that we don't just whine and argue about things.

Who cares? Have you found _anything_ that Martin removed that was at all
worthwhile? I sure haven't.
Guys, you have to realize that the IDE layer has eight YEARS of absolute
crap in it. Seriously. It's _never_ been cleaned up before. It has stuff
so distasteful that t's scary.
Take it from me: it's a _lot_ easier to add cruft and crap on top of clean
code. You can do it yourself if you want to. You don't need a maintainer
to add barnacles.
All the information that /proc/ide gave you is basically available in
hdparm, and for your dear embedded system it apparently takes up less
space by being in user space. So what is the problem?
My vote is to remove as much as humanly possible.
