Subject: Ext2 quota bug in 2.4.8

  Hello,
  Jan Sanislo <oystr@cs.washington.edu> found a bug in ext2 quota code in 2.4.6+.
During changes in ext2 code in 2.4.6 some DQUOT_INIT()s were removed but they
shouldn't and as a result quota is not computed right.
  The patch which adds missing DQUOT_INIT()s is below. I didn't place DQUOT_INIT()s to
original places but rather to generic vfs parts which seems better to me.
  Please apply - patch is against 2.4.8.
								Honza
