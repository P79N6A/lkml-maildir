There's also dtfs... Ted has a link to it from his homepage
under the Ext2 homepage...
http://web.mit.edu/tytso/www/linux/ext2.html
See the bottom of the page. DTFS is very interesting, but
needs testers and coders! It'd be nice to finally have an
LVM, a plain block allocation traditional ext2, ext3 with
journaling, a log based fs with personalities of all those,
reiser with journalling, an fs with btree metadata, reiser
with btree organized metadata AND datablocks, etc etc etc...
Isn't Linux grand?

I was wondering is there any development on a journalised filesystem for
linux.
