Subject: PROBLEM: mkdep.c lacks a little endian definition for little endian mips machines
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

[1.] One line summary of the problem:
mkdep.c lacks a little endian definition for little endian mips machines
[2.] Full description of the problem/report:
When doing a make depend, mkdep.c is compiled in ./scripts.  mkdep.c lacks
a definition for the mips architecture, and thus creates a binary that
does not work in a little endian system.
[3.] Keywords (i.e., modules, networking, kernel):
kernel, depend, dependencies, build
[4.] Kernel version (from /proc/version):
2.2.1
[5.] Output of Oops.. message (if applicable) with symbolic information
     resolved (see Documentation/oops-tracing.txt)
not applicable
[6.] A small shell script or example program which triggers the
     problem (if possible)
[7.] Environment
[7.1.] Software (add the output of the ver_linux script here)

[7.3.] Module information (from /proc/modules):

Attached devices: none
[7.5.] Other information that might be relevant to the problem
       (please look in /proc and include all information that you
       think to be relevant):
mips machines <CAN> be set to either little or big endian.  Perhaps
a endianess test should be performed before mkdep is built, rather
than the current test for alpha/i386/arm?
[X.] Other notes, patches, fixes, workarounds:
in mkdep.c
#if defined(__alpha__) || defined(__i386__) || defined(__arm__)   
#define LE_MACHINE
#endif
SHOULD BE CHANGED TO
#if defined(__alpha__) || defined(__i386__) || defined(__arm__) ||  
defined(__mips__)
#define LE_MACHINE
#endif
