I just received a new Cyrix MII (for me) and a 200 MHz IDT Winchip (for my
neighbour, who has a single-voltage motherboard).  
Checking them out on my system, I found that with the Winchip in place, my
BIOS only detected the first 96 MB of memory in my 128 MB system.  Apart
from that, Linux worked like a champ, and I got performance equivalent to a
233 MHz Pentium on my personal chess benchmark (which is no less silly than
bogomips, IMHO).
So, for the CPU gurus:
- Is there any explicit code for the Winchip in Linux ?
- Which processor type group should I compile the kernel for ?
- Any idea why it only saw 96 MB of memory ?
And, does anyone have anything they need checking out for compatibility with
this chip ?  I've got cycles to spare...
