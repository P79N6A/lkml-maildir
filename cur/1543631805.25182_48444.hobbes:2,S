I strongly support this statement, and I'm pretty sure all the RTAI
developers do the same. It would be _much_ better for all people involved
in the realtime Linux development if we would work _together_ like in the
very beginning instead of fighting each other. Too much energy has been
wasted yet.  
And honestly, I'm also thinking that even from the commercial point of
view, a situation where the realtime Linux community joins it's forces to
create the best General Purpose Realtime Operating System on earth in terms
of _technical_ arguments would not be a bad one. For _everyone_, FSM-Labs
and the rest of the world. 
But that's just my 0.02 Euro.
