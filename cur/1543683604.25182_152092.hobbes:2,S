Subject: 2.6.0-test2: IDE TCQ locks up on Promise chip.

Hi,
I have a board with VIA KT133 and Promise 20265(R) jumpered for UATA/100
(rather than ATA/RAID), an IBM DTLA-307045 drive is attached to the
Promise controller (/dev/hde). On boot-up, the kernel tries to enable
tagged command queueing for that drive, but the completion interrupt
never occurs, so the kernel resets the ATA channel. fdisk -l /dev/hde hangs.
I haven't yet tried the drive with the VIA chip, so I cannot say whether
-test2 TCQ is hosed altogether or just on the Promise chip.
Note: FreeBSD-4 (FreeBSD-5 doesn't support ATA TCQ at the moment) has
blacklisted this Promise chip for ATA TCQ:
http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/src/sys/dev/ata/ata-disk.c?rev=1.60.2.24&content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup&only_with_tag=RELENG_4
Check the function ad_tagsupported(), it blacklists my chip (the third /case/ applies):
    switch (adp->device->channel->chiptype) {
    case 0x4d33105a: /* Promises before TX2 doesn't work with tagged queuing */
    case 0x4d38105a:
    case 0x0d30105a:
    case 0x4d30105a:
        return 0;
    }
