Hi!
I just booted into a 2.6.28-17244-gb58602a kernel that is the currently recent
git code. The reiserfs fs has some major probs when booting this kernel. I just
--rebuild-tree 4 partitions which are OK now again. When booting my Gentoo box
says it cannot create an /etc/mtab~nnnn file and such. When I boot into stock
2.6.28, however, anything is OK. I re-tested that 3 times. Anytime I boot into
the git kernel the messages occur and I shutdown the box via acpid (power
button) as quick as I can.
/var/log/messages has some of these for me:

Please let me know if I can help out with some tests or something. Please also
CC me as I'm currently not in the list ... :/
