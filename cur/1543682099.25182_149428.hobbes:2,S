I wouldn't say impossible, but definitively not nice.
OTOH a usage indicator is useful and the network driver knows if one of 
its devices is in use, but the module count is the only way to tell this 
to module code and there is currently no sane way to have a use count and 
force the removal of a module.
The network device cleanup is without doubt needed, but I would have 
prefered to accompany it with module layer cleanup. The current module 
code continues a lot of the old design mistakes.
bye, Roman
