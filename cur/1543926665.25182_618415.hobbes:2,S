Subject: [PATCH 3/3] wait_task_stopped: fix racy ->exit_code/exit_state manipulations
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

(don't know how to test this, hopefully Roland can take a look and ack/nack)
wait_task_stopped() writes to p->exit_code before checking that this is still
safe to do. Suppose for example that the child resumed and entered do_exit()
at the time we re-acquired tasklist lock. We can see ->exit_code != 0 and
->exit_state == 0 (the window is not that small), in that case we report the
the wrong value, and confuse the subsequent wait_task_zombie() because we
clear ->exit_code.
Change the code to ensure that the child is still TASK_TRACED/TASK_STOPPED
when we play with its ->exit_code. Actually, now we return EAGAIN if the
->state is "valid" but was was changed in between, this looks like a right
thing to do.
