There is an updated patch at
	
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rml/sched/ingo-O1/sched-fixes-O1-rml-2.4.19-pre7-ac2-2.patch
and your favorite mirror.  With the following changes:
	- include linux/interrupt.h in sched.c
	- use yield() where appropriate, not the old method
which are boring and only needed for those with compile problems.
