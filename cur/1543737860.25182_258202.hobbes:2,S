Ok, thanks. It turns out now that I (and a lot of people with me) have
always been wrong about this. I will go fix the application (dnsmasq) and
try to get the fix to the author.
Sorry about my wrongly blaming the kernel. I do think this issue shows hat
the select(2) manual needs fixing.
For clarity, I'd like to point out that my case has nothing to do with
multi-threading. Using select from multiple threads is a totally different
sort of mistake.
Bye,
  Joris.
