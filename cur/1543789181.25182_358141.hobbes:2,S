Have you tried running "strace" on this find command in order to figure
out which syscall is returning EOVERFLOW? If it is getdents, please
could you confirm that the same error occurs in the same place on
2.6.12?
...Oh, and could I have a binary tcpdump of the traffic between the
client and server when this happens. Please use something like
tcpdump -w /tmp/dump.out -s 9000 host <servername> and port 2049
Cheers,
  Trond
