As for the ISDN code (4 copies), there is the plan to use a a common HDLC
en/decoding module, however that's a 2.5 thing. I'll take a look if I can
find a generic solution then, but it might turn out difficult - having a
module of its own just for that table wastes nearly a page, so that's
probably worse than the current state of affairs.
