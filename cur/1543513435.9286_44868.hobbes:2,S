I just ran into the problem quoted below; however, it was fixed by
compiling my kernel with egcs-1.1.2 instead of gcc-2.95.1.  My config
follows for your perusal.  Could this be a problem caught by
gcc-2.95.1, or is it just because it takes more work to uncompress the
kernel created with gcc-2.95.1?  Oh yeah, the kernel in question is
2.2.13pre17.
