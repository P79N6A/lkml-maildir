I'm using NFSv3/UDP.
I found that the actual requests size was 16KB, after doing some hacks
in server&client I managed to make it 60KB, now I see better
performance, and I see that the average request size is ~130KB which
means that there is actually read-ahead. but why it's only 130KB? how
can I make it larger?
when I run local dd with bs=4K, I can see that the average IO size is
more than 300KB.
