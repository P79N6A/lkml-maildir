Emacs does it too by default.  But of course I turn on
backup-by-copying-when-linked because when I edit a shell script that
has multiple names, I do want all instances to be updated.
Besides, editors and the only things which modify files in a source
tree.
Personally I don't copy kernel source trees because the copy takes ages.
So occasionally I do get confused about which set of files is the
official set, and have to untar apply about 49 kernel patches to
reconstruct it.  That's pretty slow too :-)
