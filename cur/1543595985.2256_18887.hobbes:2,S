We've got a couple of VA rackmount servers with adaptec scsi controllers that 
print out several SCREENS worth of information as they probe all the busses 
and joyfully announce that yes, there are still hard drives plugged into some 
of them, and even gives me a list of the ones that DON'T have hard drives 
plugged into them.
Interestingly, the bios also goes through a very similar ritual earlier in 
the boot.
