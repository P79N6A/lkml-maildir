I'd tend to agree with Pat then.  The original pm_ops seem to be
designed around ACPI and after looking at the spec I don't think they're
correct. (e.g. it looks like _PTS and _GTS should be run after
device_suspend() instead of before, so *prepare may not be needed).  In
short, this tends to be tricky.  It's probably best to have platforms
handle it on their own with kernel/power as a library.
Thanks,
