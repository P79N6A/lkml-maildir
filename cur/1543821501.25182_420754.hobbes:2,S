Problem is there is no way to know whether the underlying fs
supports direct IO or not here (fcntl is implemented outside
the filesystem, entirely).  Which is not unfixable in itself
(could use a superblock flag or something similar) but it's
way out of scope for the sort of change going into 2.4 these
days.
