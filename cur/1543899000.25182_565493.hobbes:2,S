In hidinput_connect we do:
          input_dev->dev.parent = hid->dev;
This should pin hid object untill all inputs are released. However
bluetooth does not use driver model and does not have hid->dev set up
and so it looks like we are simply trying to unregister an input
device that is already gone... I still don't quite get how we
unregister the same device twice - it is done from a per-hid-device
thread in hidp...
