All,
Anyone know what causes an error like this:
init: error while loading shared libraries: init: 
symbol __ctype_h, version GLIBC_2.0 not defined in 
file libc.so.6 with link time reference
Booted a 2.2.18pre16 box and it failed to come back
up throwing that message after the unused kernel space
was freed.
Any information is appreciated.
