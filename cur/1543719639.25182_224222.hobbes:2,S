Ah, thanks for solving this mystery. 
select and futex may not be the only ones that need to be fixed
for sparc64. I grepped through the list of syscalls that you
call without a sys32.S wrapper and found these that take at least
five arguments:
compat_sys_io_getevents, compat_sys_mount, sys_fsetxattr,
sys_setsockopt, sys_llseek, sys_mremap, sys_remap_file_pages,
sys_setxattr, sys_lsetxattr, sys_fsetxattr, sys32_fadvise64,
sys32_fadvise64_64, sys32_ipc, sys32_mremap, sys32_pciconfig_read,
sys32_pciconfig_write, sys32_prctl, sys32_pread64, sys32_pwrite64,
sys32_rt_sigaction
I did not check which ones are safe anyway, but you probably
want to go through that list.
