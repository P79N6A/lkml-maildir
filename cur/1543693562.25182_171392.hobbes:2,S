Thanks, that does avoid the error messages in the kernel log but it does
not solve the problem. You can download a strace log from
http://twerner.debian.net/strace.out.bz2
 . You will see a programm that
repeatedly opens a file in append mode, writes some data and closes the
file. Sometimes the close need overs half a second which is far to much.
(Please just 'grep close strace.out' to see it clearly.)
It did work with some older kernel that I have already deinstalled. :-(
Regards,
Torsten
