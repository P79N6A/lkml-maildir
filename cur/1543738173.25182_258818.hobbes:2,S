	Just a thought: could a system-wide ld preload of some form be useful
here? You could use preload to add wrappers around the necessary calls
(you'd probably want to do this in /etc/ld.so.preload). Then have those
wrappers communicate with a daemon or open some /etc config files that
describe the topology you wish to enforce.
