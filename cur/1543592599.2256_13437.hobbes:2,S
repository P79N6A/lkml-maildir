Probably the place to hack this is in the framebuffer console code.  This
will not help with BIOS messages, but you _should_ be able to get all
Linux output in the portrait rotated mode with the FB console.

X does not have a standard DPI, so it doesn't really matter.  On CRT
screens, you could adjust your DPI via XFree86 modelines.  On LCD
screens DPI is fixed so you have to work with that.  If the screen
supports DDC (it should if it is new), it will tell the X server what
the DPI is, so you don't need to set it manually.  Running "xdpyinfo"
under X will tell you what the resolution is (my current screen happens
to report 109x112 DPI = 1600x1200 on a 19" screen).  I think GIMP can
work with the DPI info reported from the X server.
Cheers, Andreas
