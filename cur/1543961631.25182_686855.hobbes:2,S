eek.  sys_sysinfo() copies this structure out to userspace verbatim. 
Increasing its size by four bytes will cause memory scribbles in userspace
applications.
That's fixable by suitably adjusting sysinfo._f, but given the lack of
version information in the sysinfo struct, I'm not sure how useful this
change really is.
