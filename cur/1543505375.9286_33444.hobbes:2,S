I noticed in the 2.3.13-pre8 patches that some source files
set up resource.start and resource.size, and then set
  resource.end = resource.start + resource.size;
while other sources set
  resource.end = resource.start + resource.size - 1;
Do some of these need to be corrected?
Has someone already done it?
Which is the correct value for resource.end?
