Well, what do you know -- that seems to have fixed it! I took out one stick
of RAM (so it's down to 1 gig) and it seems to work fine, now, without any
boot parameters or anything. (mind you, murphy's law will dictate that it'll
crash about 30 seconds after I send this...)
I'm amazed at that -- but I'm not going to look a gift horse in the mouth,
this has been frustrating me for far too long. :-)
Although, having said that, I'm curious... It is working because there's
only 1 gig of RAM in there, or because it's only a single stick (ie. not
dual-channel)? It works fine with both sticks, individually, just not both
together... I wonder what the cause of it actually is...
Thanks heaps for the suggestion!
Cheers,
Michael
