Fascinating. Which kernel version are you using? This patch doesn't seem
to have made it to mainline:
---
slob: fix free block merging at head of subpage
We weren't merging freed blocks at the beginning of the free list.
Fixing this showed a 2.5% efficiency improvement in a userspace test
harness.

I suppose that's possible.

I'm sure I don't have it any more, as that was back in July or so. How
about you send me your config and I'll try to figure out what's going
