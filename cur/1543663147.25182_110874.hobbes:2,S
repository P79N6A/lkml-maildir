I don't quite understand.  
There are some issue with this patch, however.
Firstly, the owner field should probably be in struct proto_ops not
struct socket, where the function pointers are.
The sk thing looks reasonable at first glance.  Getting a reference to
npf->owner, then holding it for the socket is a little confusing, but
an obvious optimization over a naive "get, use, drop, get".

You still need to check the result of try_module_get, and fail if it
fails.  The *only* time this will fail is when someone is doing an
"rmmod --wait" on the module, which presumably means they really do
not want you to increase the reference count furthur.
Hope that helps,
Rusty.
