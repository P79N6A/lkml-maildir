Linux 2.0.3x defines that the total memory used up by args & environment
is 32 pages long.  So, if you arglist+env size is > 32 pages (128k on
intel.... twice that alpha), you're screwed :-).
Most UNIXen have a similar limit on arg & env size.
Answer: linux imposed limit.  Limited arg lists are not unique to linux tho.
