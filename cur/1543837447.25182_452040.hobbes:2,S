Subject: [PATCH 0/2] posix-timers: Fix wrong behaviour of clock_nanosleep()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/8/9/399

This patch set fixes 2 problems in clock_nanosleep(). One is clock_nanosleep()
does not return the remaining time and returns wrong errno to user in compatibility
mode, if it is interrupted by a signal and restarts sleeping.
The other one is posix_cpu_nsleep() does not handle the flags argument properly.
Sincerely,
Toyo Abe <toyoa@mvista.com>
