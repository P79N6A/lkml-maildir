Who isn't speaking?
90% of the objections to having devfs in the kernel
are easily solved with "well don't use it then".
The remaining objections can be or _have_been_
dealt with in a rational manner.
I personally do not use MISC binaries. I do not
use CPU's that lack FPU's. I have no FDDI or ATM
cards. I rarely use a system that has a sound card.
All of these things are in the kernel, and I wouldn't
suggest removing them just because they are "unUnixlike"
or that I personally have no use for them.
I do NOT compile options I do not need/use into my kernels.
