I've been reworking the DRM code to better support two dissimilar video
card. I pratice on a PCI Rage128 and AGP Radeon. 
I would also like to start making infastructure changes to allow two
independently logged in users, one on each head. Multihead DRM cards
will show one device per head. If you set a merged fb mode the other
head will get disabled. 
This is the general plan I am working towards...
