including pausing all drivers before the transition and unpausing them

are these numbers for the CPU itself or for the a larger chunk? I could 
easily see these numbers for motherboard (including CPU and RAM), but it 
would surprise me if these numbers are for the CPU itself. I'm used to 
seeing datasheets that have a much more linear voltage/freq (and therefor 
a quadratic voltage/power) curve. in some cases the voltage requirements 
drop faster then the frequency.

if you can idle the system as a whole I agree with you fully. most PC 
hardware (including the mobile stuff) doesn't change it's power 
consumption much with load. at Usenix there was a presentiation (I don't 
remember if it was by Amazon or Google) about this subject, showing that 
current PC hardware only goes down to 50% power when idle (short of 
switching power modes) and that they and other big companies were pushing 
vendors to improve their hardware, aiming to get the idle power down to 
10% (again without suspending anything). so there's some chance that this 
will change before too long.

this assumes that you can cache 1 second of video, if you have more 
real-time requirements you have a much harder time (say video confrancing 
where you don't get the frame until just before you need to display it)
