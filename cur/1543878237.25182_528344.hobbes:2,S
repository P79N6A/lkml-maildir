First, thanks for response.
Ok, I see IRQ0 mapping to virtual number is good solution but I know the
problem from the times of 2.4 kernel. It was very surprising while moving to
2.6 kernel - serial driver was changed, but we have the same problem there.
Maybe it's good idea to create unofficial ppc linux branch repository
(or it already exists ?) where we can put patches that work (as above) but
not in pretty good way linux community expects.
