I doubt that we need all of the kallsyms data in the kernel as well (unless
you're using kdb.)
One of the things on my todo list is to look into a kallsyms replacement
that allows cross-compilation (and actually allows kallsyms to work at
all on ARM.)
ARM requires the ELF architecture private flags to be set correctly to link
two objects together.  So there's two problems with the current setup:
1. can't cross-compile with kallsyms
2. can't natively compile with kallsyms on architectures that require
   the private flags to be set correctly.
