Hi, Randy:
I'll make a pass thru the noreclaim patches and fix up the comment
blocks that are not quite kernel-doc.  I have to update some of the
patch descriptions as well, as some have become stale thanks to
additional work by Kosaki-san [e.g., the page vec cleanup].
I'll discuss with Rik, off-list, how to coordinate for the next
reposting.
Thanks,
Lee
