You can't rename("foo:sheesh", "bar:sheesh") anyway. You can
rename("foo:sheesh", "foo:kebab") but not -rename- a stream from one file
to another. 
OTOH, if you were to create "foo:sheesh", a zero-length file
called 'foo' would be created if it didn't already exist. However, if
you're creating a stream, you're not going to be at all suprised by the
effects of a zero-length 'holding' file being created as a side-effect
(I'd personally be worried if it wasn't).
However, the : can't easily be used because it's used in far too many
places already, the / can't be used because it implies a directory..
