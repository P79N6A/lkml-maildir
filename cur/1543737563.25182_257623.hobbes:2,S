probably ought to look like the Solaris UI here.  isn't there a "cachefs" mount option on Solaris?  anyway, reusing "posix" just for a prototype seems harmless enough.

yup, we want to avoid adding any transport specific detail in the NFS client, and leave that kind of stuff to the RPC client.  good catch, trond.
i did a lengthy study of the AFS cache manager about a decade ago.  interestingly, the place where it really falls down is in recycling disk blocks for use with a new incoming file to be cached.  the underlying cache file system has to get rid of the on-disk data for old files before it can reuse the blocks for a new file.  otherwise, the old data is exposed if the new file maps in pages it hasn't written to yet.  if the cache is turning over quickly, handling this correctly can result in serious disk thrashing as the cache file system frees and erases blocks on disk and then reallocates them to the new file.
steve, is there [english] documentation somewhere that describes how the cachefs works?
