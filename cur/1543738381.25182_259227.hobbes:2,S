To the best of my understanding, this still doesn't provide deterministic
hard-real-time performance in Linux.

It's been quite a while since any of this has been true.

I guess you haven't taken a look at the work on RTAI/fusion lately.
Applications use the same Linux API, and get deterministic
hard-real-time response times. It's really much less complicated
to use than the above-suggested aggregate.
