It works for me.  Using
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/stuff/ext3-tools.tar.gz
:
sleep 10000 < /dev/hda5 &  # Keep bdev open - coz last close() syncs it
# This doesn't sync the device:
write-and-fsync -m 20 /dev/hda5 ; read-and-fsync -m 20 /dev/hda5
# This does:
write-and-fsync -m 20 /dev/hda5 ; read-and-fsync -f -m 20 /dev/hda5
It's a bit odd to do an fsync() on an O_RDONLY fd, but it does the fsync.
