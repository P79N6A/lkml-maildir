Interbench is a benchmarking application designed to emulate the CPU 
scheduling behavior of interactive tasks and measure their scheduling latency 
and jitter. It does this first with the tasks on their own and then in the 
presence of various background loads.

Changes since v0.21:
Real time processes were converted to also do mlockall().
2.4 kernel support was added thanks to Miguel Freitas.
Some overflow accounting bugs were fixed.
Cheers,
Con
