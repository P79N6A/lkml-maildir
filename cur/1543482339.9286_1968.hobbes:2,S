I realized that it is silly of me to post these in the form of patches,
(since the patches are longer than the two source files combined).  So here
are the source files, just copy them over linux/drivers/scsi/megaraid.c and
linux/drivers/scsi/megaraid.h,
they will work for 2.0,2.1, and 2.2 kernels.
Also I forgot to mention there is a Redhat boot.img and supp.img that has
the driver (older version) on it so you can install to a RAID drive as the
boot device... at
