That being said, the percpu_counters aren't a terribly successful concept
and probably do need a revisit due to the high inaccuracy at high CPU
counts.  It might be better to do some generic version of vm_acct_memory()
instead.
If the benchmarks say that we need to.  If we cannot observe any problems
in testing of existing code and if we can't demonstrate any benefit from
the patched code then one option is to go off and do something else ;)
