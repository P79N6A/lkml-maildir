Thanks for picking up the patches from Kumar and myself and fitting  
them into your series - this is much appreciated.  FYI, I applied the  
entire patch series to my local tree and test-booted both mpc8641 and  
mpc8568mds and both build and boot cleanly. I also built pasemi and  
ebony, those build cleanly as well.
Cheers,
Becky
