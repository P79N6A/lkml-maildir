menuconfig could include a feature which lists a dependency tree on the 
current option, that is, f.ex., hitting 'D' on CONFIG_INET_AH (IP: AH 
transformation) could 
give this screen:
--- Depends ---
[ ] Networking support
    [ ] TCP/IP networking
--- Selects ---
[*] CONFIG_XFRM
[*] Cryptogrpahic API
    --- HMAC support
    <M> MD5 digest algorithm
    <M> SHA1 digest algorithm
--- Selected by ---
And, now let's take a 'D' on CONFIG_CRYPTO_HMAC:
--- Depends ---
[*] Cryptographic API
--- Selects ---
--- Selected by ---
[*] Experimental
[*] Networking support
    [*] TCP/IP Networking
    [*] INET: AH transform
    [*] INET: ESP transform
    [*] INET6: AH transform
    [*] INET6: ESP transform
    [*] SCTP
So you can:
- enable any Depends to make CONFIG_INET_AH available
- see what it selects and cycle between <*> and <M> (if possible)
  for Selected options
- deselect all the Selected Bys to be able to unselect CRYPTO_HMAC
  itself[3]
[3] would be a tough thing because you can select with && and ||, in which 
case it should simply list all the options specified in the Kconfig without 
regard to && and || combinatinos.
