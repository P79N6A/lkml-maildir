Yeah, it's an easy mistake to make.
I've made it myself - grepping for page_table_lock and coming up empty in
places where I expected it to be.
In fact, if somebody sends me patches to remove the "vmlist_access_lock()"
stuff completely, and replace them with explicit page_table_lock things,
I'll apply it pretty much immediately. I don't like information hiding,
and right now that's the only thing that the vmlist_access_lock() stuff is
doing.
