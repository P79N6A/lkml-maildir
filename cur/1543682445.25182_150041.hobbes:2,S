At least in /etc/syslog.conf on my RH9/RH Rawhide system there is no a-
anywhere in the syslog.conf.  Not only that, but I don't seem to have
much more logging going on, in fact maybe a bit less.  Exceptions:
smartd (which seems to only log about once an hour, so this isn't it)
and a few places where char 188 and char 10_133, I think it is, are not
found (just fixed this, and this doesn't happen much either).
