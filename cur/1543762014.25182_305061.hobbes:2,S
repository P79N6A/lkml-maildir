Mutter, mutter, curse, mutter.
We got stuck on things like backtrace going on forever, and then trying
to find a way to get GDB to believe we want it to stop backtracing.  I
think we've finally got that, in a way the GDB folks will approve and
won't horribly clutter the kernel.
We also got stuck on catching memory faults cleanly since it seems the
set_fs(KERNEL_DS) trick we used to use (and I swear worked), stopped
working around 2.6.10, but I haven't found time to go back and verify
when it stopped working.
