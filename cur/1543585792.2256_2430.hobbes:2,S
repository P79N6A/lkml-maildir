I use it for storing data, but when I do netif_rx() on skb, I cannot touch it
anymore, so no data there is belong to me, and if I read that code in
ip_input.c, it gets zeroed.
BTW, I found that it's not ip_input.c that sends me 'source routing rejected'
message, because no message is logged. It might be some other place.
But anyway something is wrong in IP layer.

But comment in skbuff.h claims that any owner of skb can use cb for its own needs, till it passes ownership to whoever else.

What for?
