There's no guarantee that the kernel that's running was compiled using 
that header file which (on my system i.e. RedHat 9) comes as part of the 
glibc package.  It also gets the value indirectly via linux/param.h 
which in turn gets it via asm/param.h which makes any such program 
highly non portable.  Not to mention that the HZ obtained this way is 
100 which is actually not the same as HZ in the 2.6.5-rc3 kernel that 
I'm running.
