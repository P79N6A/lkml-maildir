SHA1 should be fine, as are the pool mixing bits. Much more
problematic is the ability to do timing attacks against the entropy
gathering itself. If an attacker can guess the TSC value that gets
mixed into the pool, that's a problem.
It might not be much of a problem though. If he's a bit off per guess
(really impressive), he'll still be many bits off by the time there's
enough entropy in the primary pool to reseed the secondary pool so he
can check his guesswork.
