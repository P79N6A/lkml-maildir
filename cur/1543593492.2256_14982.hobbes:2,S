The hard rule will always be that to cover all pathological cases swap
must be greater than RAM.  Because in the worse case all RAM will be
in thes swap cache.  That this is more than just the worse case in 2.4
is problematic.  I.e. In the worst case: 
Virtual Memory = RAM + (swap - RAM).
You can't improve the worst case.  We can improve the worst case that
many people are facing.

It's worth complaining about.  It is also worth digging into and find
out what the real problem is.  I have a hunch that this hole
conversation on swap sizes being irritating is hiding the real
problem.
