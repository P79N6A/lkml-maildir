I went through and made a bunch of these flags signed so that they would 
sign-extend properly in 32 vs 64 bit.  We could make them 
unconditionally 64-bit, but I'm worried that will have unforeseen 
consequences too.
In this case, PAGE_MASK should probably be signed too, so the sign 
extension happens properly.
Alternatively, they could be cast to pteval_t and/or phys_addr_t so that 
they will have an inherent size which matches the pagetable format 
(using _AT() rather than _AC()).
