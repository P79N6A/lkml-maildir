Same graphics card here [1]. _Almost_ same problem:
I booted 2.6.1 with vga=795. It booted fine.
In 2.6.2-rc[12] I get a blank screen booting with that vga parameter.
With 2.6.1 if I tried to use radeonfb, system just booted with a vga
console and no fbdevice was available. If I try to use radeonfb in
2.6.2-rc[12] it only works with 640x480 resolution (any other resolution
results in an unsupported frequency on my monitor, system boots fine,
tough).
_Plus_, if I try to change the resolution (with fbset) on my radeonfb
console, it changes; but when I switch to another tty, the monitor gets
an unsupported frequency again and the only way to restore the image is
to blindly set the resolution again to 640x480 with fbset.
Relevant part of config follws:
$ cat /boot/config-2.6.2-rc2 | grep ^CONFIG | egrep -i "fb|radeon|console"
CONFIG_VT_CONSOLE=y
CONFIG_HW_CONSOLE=y
CONFIG_DRM_RADEON=m
CONFIG_FB=y
CONFIG_FB_VESA=y
CONFIG_FB_RADEON=y
CONFIG_VGA_CONSOLE=y
CONFIG_DUMMY_CONSOLE=y
CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE=y
CONFIG_PCI_CONSOLE=y
This output is exactly the same for 2.6.1, 2.6.2-rc1 and 2.6.2-rc2.
Please, let me know if I can provide any additional information.
Thanks in advance.
