So they are provocating war. It's their choice. ORBS did not started that war.
We'll see results.

Hmm. How they can find if  I'm using ORBS or not ? They bloked his clients
from sending mail to me. Good for me :-)
GB> YOU are the one being blocked from receiving mail.
Yes. And as far as I get mail from my friends (and important peoples like Cox)
it's Ok for me to be blocked.

Which one ?

If *I* added ORBS check to my sendmail.cf then I'm who elected them :-)
Why you do not asking the same about MAPS RBL ?

This is not exactly right. This will just split Internet and we'll get two
parts: one where ORBS is useless and one for which ORBS give correct results.
Mail from first one can not go to the second. I prefer to be in second part
but if it'll make my friends anavailable I'll switch to first one.
GB> Those how choose to use them will find their own communications hampered.
We'll see :-) Ones who want to cross border line will find their communications
hampered. And so far all my friends on side where ORBS is usefull.

Why ? It's the only thing ORBS can do.

Try if you can. Good luck.

Hmm. Since you still can send mail to me your own admindoes not block these
probes. Start from him and cut yourself from linux-kernel :-)
