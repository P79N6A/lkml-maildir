find_task_by_pid and find_pid are to be removed, but this task
heavily depends on others.
E.g. to drop the find_pid() we need to kill the kill_proc() 
function, which in turn depends on turning the usbatm, nfs and 
lockd code into kthread API. We're currently working on this.

Yes, but unfortunately simple conversion from find_xxx_pid into
find_xxx_vpid is not possible - each case is special.
