I wrote the critter on my x86 laptop and dualathlon desktop.  I only did
additional testing on PPC.  Both give me bunches of symbols.
Stock redhat 7.2 gives me hundreds of module symbols when I load up a bunch
of modules (via ksyms -a or cat /proc/ksyms).  A cross-build of
stock modutils-2.4.16 for x86->ppc gives me the same.
} It's really weird that the patch works in a generic manner for you, maybe our
} userspace side is different than, or maybe it's a difference on ppc where
} you're not trimming the symbol list to the exported functions?
I'm testing with multi .c modules.  I haven't tested with a single
.c module though.
} I guess it worked for you because you've single file .c modules, that interface
} with each other, so there every extern function is going to be exported.
} 
} modutils could build the whole symbol table if asked to, so with a change of
} insmod you could make your patch to work in a generic manner for all
} module symbols too, but it would be a waste of ram like kksymoops.
