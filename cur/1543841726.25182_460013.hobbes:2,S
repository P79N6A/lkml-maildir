I suppose it's a matter of taste, but personally I think the mere
mentioning of 'for' allows you to directly see that there is some kind
of looping involved. And it shouldn't be terribly complex:
for (i = 0;i < 8;i++) {
    resp[i] = readw(addr + RESPONSE + (7 - i)*4) << 16;
    resp[i] |= readw(addr + RESPONSE + (6 - i)*4);
}

The problem is that it's a big difference between seeing "data TO" and
seeing "data to" in the code. How about using the three letter
abbreviations in those places? I.e. "cto" and "dto"?

Hmm.... I'm planning on putting together a test module to determine this
(as my specs aren't crystal clear on the subject either). I'll try to
remember to send it to you. :)
