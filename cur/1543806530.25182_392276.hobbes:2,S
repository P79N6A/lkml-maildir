Suspend2 uses a strong internal API to separate the method of determining
the content of the image from the method by which it is saved. The code for
determining the content is part of the core of Suspend2, and
transformations (compression and/or encryption) and storage of the pages
are handled by 'modules'.
The name is currently mostly historical, from the time when these
components could be built as kernel modules. That function was dropped to
help with merging, but I'd like to reintroduce it later, since some
embedded developers want to use Suspend2 to improve boot times. If/when
that happens, I'll do it in a way that doesn't require as many exported
symbols as was previously required. For now, though, the name remains,
along with a few functions that are needed for building as modules. My
expectation is that merging will take some time; perhaps by that time, I'll
have modular support back in, in a better form.
