Running a busy DNS/Radius server with Red Hat 6.1 and their 2.2.12-20
kernel, I just got a few of these messages which seem to come from
ipv4/tcp.c tcp_recvmsg():
recvmsg bug: copied EB63B4C2 seq 0
recvmsg bug: copied EB63B4C2 seq 0
recvmsg bug: copied EB63B4C2 seq 0
recvmsg bug: copied EB63B4C2 seq 0
The comment right above this printk says
                        /* Now that we have two receive queues this 
                         * shouldn't happen.
                         */
