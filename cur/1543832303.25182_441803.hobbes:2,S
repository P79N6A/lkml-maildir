So does i386 convert the return value of the times(2) call to user
hertz?  On IA64, it returns the value in internal clock ticks, and
then when a program uses the value in param.h, it gets it wrong now,
because internal HZ is now 250.
So is times() is broken in IA64, or is this an exception to Alan's
statement?
