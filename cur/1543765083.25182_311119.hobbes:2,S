We (Digi) cares.
We want people to use our DGNC driver over the JSM driver in all
cases except the 2 port model of the board.
This is because the DGNC driver contains extra features that the JSM
driver
Has stripped out, to get into the kernel sources,
and our other customers WANT these features!
We cannot have a situation where the JSM driver takes control of the PCI
card
before the DGNC driver can take it first!
Please, do *NOT* add this patch!!!
Do I, as a copyright holder on the code in question, have any rights at
all,
or are you just going to trample over my wishes, in your zeal?

Who cares?  If you're driver was written properly (which I hope for you)
it'll just skip a device that's bound to the jsm driver already.
And having additional hardware support is always a good thing,
especially
if it's as trivial as that patch.
