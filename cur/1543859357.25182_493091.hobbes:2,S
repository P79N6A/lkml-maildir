That '013b' is critical information.
Bit 0: 1: exception source is external to the processor
Bit 1: 1: there is a problem with an interrupt descriptor in the IDT
Bit 2: n/a
Bits 15-3: index of the problem descriptor
So an external interrupt occurred, the system tried to use interrupt
descriptor #39 decimal (irq 7), but the descriptor was invalid.
