Probably the concern is in multiplicative increase in complexity of
configurations and I'm sure the code itself is more complex too.
Of course this is weighed off against the improvements added to the
kernel. I'm personally not too clear on what those improvements are;
a bit better soft-realtime response? (I don't know) What kind of
userbase increase would that allow? .01%, 1.0%...? Is that large
enough to warrant being included in the kernel? Does it even make
technical sense to do this in the general purpose kernel rather than
a specialised solution?
Those are the kinds of questions that will have to be debated (I
guess this mail is directed more towards Daniel than you, Ingo :)).
