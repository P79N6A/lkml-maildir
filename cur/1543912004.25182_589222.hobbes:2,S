Very much puzzled at what you propose. in-kernel we use rt_mutex (has
PI) or mutex, futexes are user-space. (on -rt spinlock_t == mutex ==
rt_mutex)
Neither disable interrupts since they are sleeping locks.
That said, on -rt we do not need to disable interrupts in the allocators
because its a bug to call an allocator from raw irq context.
