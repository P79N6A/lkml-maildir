Correct.
We don't pretend to stop someone from mmap'ing and executing bad code, we
only want to help someone who wants to use a legitimate library to know that
the right library is being used.

Yup, both of these (at least on i386) use mmap with PROT_EXEC, and go
through digsig's dsi_file_mmap check.  (I've made a note to check the
/lib/ld.so /bin/ps case on a powerpc and, if I can find one, z)
