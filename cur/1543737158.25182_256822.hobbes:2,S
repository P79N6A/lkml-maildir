	Hi!
  After upgrade to 2.6.9-rc3 on the firewall (with NAT), active ftp stopped
working. The first kernel, which doesn't work is 2.6.9-rc1.
Sympotms: passive ftp works O.K., active FTP doesn't open data stream (and in
logs there entries about invalid packets - using
iptables ... -m state --state INVALID -j LOG)
  If you need any extra data point, mail me.
	Cheers,
		Vita Samel
