According to my proposal, it is perfectly safe to call a function in a module
while the module's use count is 0.  This function would typically look like this:
foo()
{
	MOD_INC_USE_COUNT;
	copy_*_user() (or anything else that sleeps);
	
	MOD_DEC_USE_COUNT;
	return bar;
}
The only difference to the "old" module scheme is that the above currently isn't
safe on SMP systems.
