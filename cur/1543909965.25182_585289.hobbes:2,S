Most of the distros prefer a chance to add their own "Special Sauce" to it
before building, and building inside their build environment (for instance,
Fedora RPM's get PGP-signed - *that* would be a trust issue right there).
The current Fedora Rawhide kernel is 'kernel-2.6.23-0.105.rc3.fc8', and a few
RPMs ago it was based against -rc2-git5, so they track *very* close.  I think
that crew is managing well enough without help from the kernel.org build
server.
