I happen to be one of those crazy people who believe that there are 
advantages to building non-modular kernels.
1. they compile faster
2. they use less memory (if tightly configured) as each module loaded will 
average a 1/2 page of wasted memory
3. it's far easier to moveone file around then a file and a directory tree 
of modules
4. the non-modular kernel will be slightly faster (all calls to modules 
must be far calls, if it's not modular the compiler can optimize some of 
the calls)
5. once kmem and mem can be made read-only there is a security advantage 
in not having kernel modules available (yes the machine can be rebooted 
into a new kernel, but that's easier to detect then a module getting 
loaded)
6. the kernel takes less space on disk (matters in embedded devices and 
other places where your media is small)
none of this matters if you're dealing with a large desktop system that 
you are installing from a series of CD/DVD disks from a top-5 distro, but 
that's not the entire world
note that a good autodetect routine will have no impact on the kernel once 
it's compiled, it just generates a .config file.
I believe it makes more sense to have this be part of the kernel source 
distro then a seperate project as it needs to have a lot of knowledge 
about what a particular kernel supports and that's going to change from 
release to release.
