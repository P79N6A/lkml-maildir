Yes something around those lines

We could keep those unenumerated, which power state is to be used by the
device is under driver control, most of the time, they'll do D3 though,
for suspend-to-RAM, and they can probably just not do anything special
for suspend-to-disk (except shutting down the driver itself of course)
Note regarding aix7xxx, we also need proper hooks in the SCSI stack to
block the queue correctly etc... in the same way we do on IDE. I didn't
have time to look into this yet.
