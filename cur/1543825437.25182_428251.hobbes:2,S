ok fair enough
Jiri, can you test the patch below? (I don't have this hardware)
The ops structure has complex locking rules, where not all ops are
equal, some are subordinate on others for some complex sound cards. This
requires for lockdep checking that each individual reg_mutex is
considered in separation for its locking rules.
