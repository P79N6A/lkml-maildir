Gstreamer doesn't work anymore with ck1.
I tried with elevator=deadline, but it does not solve the problem.
Gstreamer works fine with kernel 2.6.3
I tested it with several programs which use gstreamer (rhythmbox, gst-launch, etc ...),
but I get no error message.
Symptoms are :
I get no sound when I try to play a sound file.
The system is slowing down a lot.
When gstreamer stops, the system come back to a good state.
