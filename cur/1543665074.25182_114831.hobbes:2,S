The smatch bugs for kernel 2.5.64 are up.  The 
new url for the smatch bug database is 
http://kbugs.org
.  
One new script from Monday was "UnFree."  This check 
looks for variables that aren't freed on the error paths.
http://kbugs.org/cgi-bin/index.py?page=bug_list&script=UnFree&kernel=2.5.64
The bug database is still under heavy construction (ie it
is really bad).  But I hope to improve it some more this
week.  Also I plan to add some documentation etc.
The possible bug count for 2.5.64 was 1018.  Eventually 
this information will all be available in a stats page but 
for now I'll just post the raw SQL...
