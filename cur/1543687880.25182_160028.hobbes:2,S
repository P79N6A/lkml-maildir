Okay, but hopefully machines being sold in retail will have bug-free
BIOSes?

You are welcome to keep the debugging version of your driver for
debugging early machines; it is even possible that 2.4.X version
distributed with SuSE is going to be "debugging" one. But I do not
think Linus/Dave Jones is going to accept debugging version into
mainline kernel.
[And I hope those BUG_ON()'s should be enough to do some debugging,
too. You will not get a nice error message but ugly backtrack, but it
should be enough].

Well, if your users will use SuSE 2.4 kernel, they will have logfile,
anyway. By the time 2.6 is widely used, I *hope* bios problems are
already fixed.

If we want the code to be in 2.6.X final, it is good to start pushing
it _now_. And we can't reasonably expect linus to eat patch with
_that_ much debugging.
