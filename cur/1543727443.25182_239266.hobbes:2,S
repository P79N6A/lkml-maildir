Indeed its nasty, the problem is there is no tagging in the main BK repository
representing the -bk tree's. It shouldnt be too hard to do something about 
this? I can't think of anything which could help...

A quick look in bk6-bk7 reveals the regression is probably related 
to either the readahead changes or, less likely, the mm/vmscan.c 
changes.
I'm attaching a tarball with "readahead" and "vmscan", Mr. Berkley 
can you try reverting these ones at a time and repeating your tests?
Thanks!
