I'm running 2.2.14pre5 on three of my servers with various revision
NetGear PCI Ethernet cards. On one of these servers, the NetGear ethernet
just plain stops working every night about 1AM (dunno why it always
happens around this time). Doing "ifdown eth0 ; ifup eth0" lets us get
back on the network again. This problem only started happening once we
upgraded to 2.2.14pre5 from 2.2.12. Information about the server having
trouble:
quad pentium pro 200/1GB RAM/2 Adaptec AIC7880U SCSI Controllers
red hat linux 6.0
tulip.c detects: Lite-On 82c168 PNIC rev 32 at 0xfc00, 00:A0:CC:3F:B2:88, IRQ 17
connected to a 10/100mbps cabletron switch
Another server with the same motherboard is running 2.2.14pre5 just fine:
dual pentium pro 200/512MB RAM/2 Adaptec AIC7880U SCSI Controllers
red hat linux 6.0
tulip.c detects: Digital DS21140 Tulip rev 34 at 0xfc80, 00:40:05:37:27:1D, 
IRQ 17.
connected to a similar 10/100mbps cabletron switch
My home workstation is also running 2.2.14pre5 fine:
dual celeron 300a/256MB RAM/NCR83c8xx SCSI
red hat linux 6.1
tulip.c detects: Lite-On 82c168 PNIC rev 33 at 0xe400, 00:A0:CC:3A:8D:8B, 
IRQ 10.
connected to a generic 10mbps hub
2.2.14pre5's tulip.c declares itself as v0.91g-ppc 7/16/99. Sometime this
coming week I am going to try compiling tulip.c v0.91 4/14/99 from
Donald's web site and see if that works properly on the quad ppro.
