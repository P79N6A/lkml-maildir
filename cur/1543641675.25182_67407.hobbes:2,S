Hi,
I am exporting kernel memory to user processes using mmap() entry point of
my driver. Now, when the user calls unmap(), I would like to deallocate the
pages which I allocated at mmap() time. How can I do that? unmap() entry
point is not provided by vm_operations structure in mm.h file.
I will really appreciate any suggestion/guidance.
Thanks,
Imran.
