I'm sure that the majority of Linux users would never acquire
the 4-board assembly that we use to acquire X-Ray data and
generate real-time images for the baggage scanners in use
at the world's major airports. That assembly, containing
numerous CPUs and other high-speed pipelined stuff would
cost the user about  US$100,000 so I'm pretty sure that
are not many takers so it is very unlikely that any modules
to support it would never get into the mainstream kernel.
If we can't build out-of-tree modules to support this stuff,
then we can't use Linux. Already, we've complied with the
GPL terms that we will give our module code to anybody,
even though it is useless without our hardware which I'm
certain they are not going to buy.
Linux is NOT just a desk-top OS. It has many other uses.
It should scare the hell out of everybody to know that
Windows CE is being used in Aircraft flight directors.
We need to maintain the viability of Linux in dedicated
or embedded operations so that it will eventually replace
such stuff. Over the years, there has been a continual
attempt to obfuscate Linux to make it more difficult to
use out-of-tree. Further, the continual internal changes,
which don't affect anything but compatibility and the
ability to compile (changes for the sake of changes),
has caused many engineers to lose all their hair. Stop!
This has gone far enough. Right now we cannot upgrade
past linux-2.6.16.24 just because some kernel hacker
decided so. This is bad, real bad.

Dick Johnson
