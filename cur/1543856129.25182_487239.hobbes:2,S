I've been working on the g4l disk imaging project, and have been trying to 
keep kernels for the cd up-to-date to work for those users with the latest 
hardware. I was recommended to try the 2.6.19-git kernel since the kernels 
since 2.6.15.6 that I've build from kernel.org do not work with the sata_via. 
All the kernels from 2.6.18.3 and below have worked with the makecd script 
that was created by the previous project manager. The 2.6.19 git and 
released kernel required me to modify the script to use a 4096 byte block 
size instead of the default 1024 bytes. Problem is, that the earlier computers 
don't mount with the 4K, but the 2.6.19 don't work with the 1K size. It goes 
all the way thru, but they fail with trying to mount the /. 
Only difference in the scripts 
Using 4K for 2.6.19 kernels 
< mke2fs -m 0 -b 4096 -N 4000 /dev/loop0 
- --- 
Using 1K default for all earlier kernels. 
> mke2fs -m 0 -N 4000 /dev/loop0 
I have no knowledge on the script, so it might be something in the script that 
makes the difference, but would like to have a way to allow both the older 
and newer kernels to reside on one image. It now requires to different CDs.
