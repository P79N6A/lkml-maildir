Yep, unless you're sharing with nfs, and the path is different on the client
than on the server...  But it would work with ftp, http, smb, or anything
that follows the symlink on the server.
What we need is quota based on file type, no not extention, but the return
value of `file`.  j/k
Can anyone come up with something useful that a treequota will help?
