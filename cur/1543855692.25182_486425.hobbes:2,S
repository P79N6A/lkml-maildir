You are saying that they should only be used to create new "primitive"
types (ie. that you can use in arithmetic / logical ops) that can
change depending on the config.
That's fair enough. I'm sure you've also said in the past that they can
be used (IIRC you even encouraged it) when the type is opaque in the
context it is being used. I won't bother trying to dig out the post,
because I could be wrong and you are entitled to change your mind. I
just want to get this straight.
Thanks,
Nick
