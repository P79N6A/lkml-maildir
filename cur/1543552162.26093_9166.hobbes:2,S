No. I'm arguing (at 4:40am and while trying to keep one eye on our
detector's data acquisition) on the basis that whoever holds the file
lock has to have a guarantee of obtaining 100% accuracy on the locked
region.
I agree that dropping pages is ugly and that it will always give
problems with shared mmap(), so if it can be shown that clearing
PG_uptodate and rereading the same page will give the required
guarantee on locking, then I'm not going to complain.
Cheers,
