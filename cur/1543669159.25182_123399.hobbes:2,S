 How's this for an alogorithm for finding which
chunk of 'R' you have hit with a given memory reference:
 o  Use a bitmap to represent the whole address range.
 o  Set the bits that correspond the the first page
    of each subregion.
 To search:
 o  Look up the bit for the page you are interested in.
 o  Scan backwards for a 1.
 o  Convert bit position to address, this is the
    base of the subregion.
 Since this is i386-only you can play neat assembler
tricks with this code to make it fast.
 (OS/2 did/does it that way.)
