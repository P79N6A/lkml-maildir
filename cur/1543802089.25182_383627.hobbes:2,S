Thanks.

Why not -1 as with the physical package id?  0 could be a valid core
id.

Really, I think the least confusing interface would not export those
attributes which are not relevant for the system.  E.g. if the system
isn't multi-core, you don't see core_id and core_siblings attributes.
Failing that, let's at least have consistent, unambiguous values for
the ids which are not applicable.

I still oppose this bit.  I want the attributes there for powerpc even
for offline cpus -- the topology information (if obtainable, which it
is on powerpc) is useful regardless of the cpu's online state.  The
attributes should appear when a cpu is made present, and go away when
a cpu is removed.
This week I'll try to do an implementation for powerpc.
