I'd love to hear the argument.   Something that would negate the disadvantage
of ntuple buffering, and the need for reverse page maps, and isn't portable.

Well, currectly supporting non-aligned mappings needs more than just a
few extra bits.  The code to update all mappings on write, and the
ability to ensure that a given byte is only faulted in for a single
offset at a time.   (Admittedly if everything is a read mapping you
can be a smidge more lax).
My solution to the issue of potentials was the idea of the vm_store.
The idea of using something besides struct inode for the page cache.
For unaligned mappings or really huge files you could have multiple
vm_store's per inode, (plus the code to keep them in sync).  
And it shouldn't incur a noticeable performance penalty as it is in
an outer loop.
To date all I've implemented is the existence of such a structure.
And the seperation of what is the page cache from all the other junk
in filemap.c
My current patch follows seperately for review.
