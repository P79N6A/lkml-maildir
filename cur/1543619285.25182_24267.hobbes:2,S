How is it possible and what can go wrong?  This will be a common thing I
think, so it'd be a good thing to know (and have reliable and be a good
idea in some form).

I think that sounds about right.  If changeset 1.123 and 1.124 are only

isn't done just yet) and the other is ready to go, the second one is
stuck.

I think that'd help a good deal of the cases.
