And BTW,
#  /sbin/hdparm -M 128 /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
 setting acoustic management to 128
 acoustic     =  0 (128=quiet ... 254=fast)
(failure but I don't care the drive is old and already in AAM mode)
#  /sbin/hdparm -M 128 /dev/sda
/dev/sda:
 setting acoustic management to 128
 HDIO_GET_ACOUSTIC failed: Inappropriate ioctl for device
(This drive however is not and needs it dearly. Plus it's the Linux
drive, so it's used most of the time)
