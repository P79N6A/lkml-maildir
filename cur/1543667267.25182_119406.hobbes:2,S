Hi,
Now 2.5.65 boots again, I'm able to confirm that the SCSI (AIC7880) issues I 
have are caused by (disfunctional) IRQ remapping code. A BIOS without MPS 1.4 
support enabled (which causes interrupt remapping on this P2L97-DS, Intel 440 
LX mainboard) makes the SCSI driver run fine.
I expected the 3Com 3c905 problems (no communication) to be fixed too, though 
they still occur. Now updating modutils so I can do tests without rebooting.
