You're right that the class device isn't currently unregistered, and 
that was an oversight in the patch I originally sent.  Attatched is a 
patch that remedies that situation.  pci_remove_bus_device() *is* the 
natural place to unregister the class_dev, and that's just what the 
patch does.

Yep.  The patch pulls the kfree() out of pci_remove_bus_device() and 
calls class_device_unregister() in it's place.  This will put() the 
bridge device and free the pci_bus as needed.  put() does need to be 
called twice because the bridge device is get()'d twice: once when the 
device is registered and once when it's bus device grabs a reference to it.

Disagree, for the reasons above. ;)  Patch attatched.
Cheers!
