If we add the 'eval' Kconfig keyword, it becomes possible, but I guess 
it isn't worth it if there are more users and anyway split 
configure/compile, as you note, breaks it.

The problem with that is that the test comes too late: after we've 
configured.  Andrew wants to keep allmodconfig working, and for that we 
need to deselect CONFIG_KVM before compilation starts.
gcc.*protector.sh only affects the Makefile, not the configuration, AFAICT.
