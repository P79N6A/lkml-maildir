Actually you have been hit by a bug in the newer BIOS's.  There may be an
even newer one that will fix this (There has been reports for some
GigaByte mother boards)
The problem is that the BIOS accesses a real mode segment while we are
still in protexted mode.  Windows copes because it returns to real
mode before shutting down.
Someone posted a patch to return to real mode a couple of days ago,
do you could try that (let me know if you need it).
Cheers,
Stephen
