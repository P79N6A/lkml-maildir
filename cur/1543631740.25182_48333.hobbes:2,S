Something like..
http://www.codemonkey.org.uk/patches/old/cpu-choice-2.diff
perhaps ? My original motivation wasn't so that we could fine grain the
compiler flags, but to cut down on the "my cpu wasn't in the list and
I didn't know which one to pick" bug reports.
I got sidetracked with something else though, which meant I never saw
this patch through to completion.. if theres any interest I'll pick it
up again.
