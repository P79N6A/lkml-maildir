Problem is in all kernel versions since 1999 or so.
I am at 2.6.10-mm2, experimented with older via-rhince.c drivers.

If it drops the link with the net I do think it IS critical.
Most of the time occurences of this bug do make my pppd choke.
ifconfig eth1 down
ifconfig eth1 up
helps.
How can we nail the cause? Fix the bug partly or completely?
Suggestions are very welcome.
Thanks,
Udo
