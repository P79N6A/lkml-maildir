I managed to send the wrong patch - the Dell one only reads from nvram. 
If nvram reads are likely to reformat your hard drive, I think Dell 
needs to reconsider its BIOS design :)
More seriously, a quick scan of libsmbios hasn't revealed any method for 
obtaining the screen brightness. It's possible that I'm blind (I'm 
certainly slightly drunk), but can you give a pointer to the correct 
mechanism for making this call?
Thanks,
