1024 TB should be around 2*10^12 512-byte blocks, divide by 10^6 (1us)
of "assumed" overhead per block operation is 2*10^6 seconds, no I
believe I'm pretty close there. I am considering everything being
"available in the cache", i.e. no waiting for disk access.

The time to update the pagetables is identical to the time to update a
4KB page when the OS is using a 2MB pagesize. Ofcourse it will take more
time to load the data into the page, however it should be a consecutive
stretch of data on disk, which should give a more efficient transfer
than small blocks scattered around the disk.

But your subsystem (the disk) was probably still using 512 byte blocks,
possibly scattered. And the OS was still using 4KB pages, it takes more
time to reclaim and gather 64 pages per IO operation than one, that's
why I'm saying that the pagesize needs to scale along with the blocksize.
The application might have been assuming a small block size as well, and
the OS was told to do several read/modify/write cycles, perhaps even 512
times as much as necessary.
I'm not saying that the current system will perform well when working
with large blocks, but compared to increasing the size of block_t, a
larger blocksize has more potential to give improvements in the long
term without adding an unrecoverable performance hit.
