That output seems rather normal.. If you're not getting anything like 
that with the other card though, I would tend to suspect some kind of 
issue with the card, the reader or some kind of incompatibility between 
them. Certainly all the USB resets from the other output would tend to 
suggest the reader isn't responding properly with that card installed..
