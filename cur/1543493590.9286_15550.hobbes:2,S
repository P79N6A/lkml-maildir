Well, message queues and semaphore functions are optional extensions to
Posix1.b.  Both of which require kernel support, as they have system
wide namespace.  No one has ever written the kernel support, so glibc
has never added the userspace functions for them.  I have the kernel
space code partically implimented somewhere, but every time I have
posted asking if someone was interested in actually using these features
of Posix.1b I get no response.  If you are interested in actually
writing this code ir have an application you really want it for, email
me.   Maybe I'll spend a weekend and get them working.  Most people just
use SYSV message queues and semaphore right now, which are supported but
glibc.
