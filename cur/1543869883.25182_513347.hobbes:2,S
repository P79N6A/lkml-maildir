Since you do not disable interrupts around the clocksource read, the
same problem applies to interrupt handlers of higher priority than the
cycle_last updating code.
A bad timestamp can make a trace quite hard to follow and more
error-prone. When someone is looking for _the_ failing case in a system,
the infrastructure used to debug must be reliable. Sometimes error cases
takes days before showing up : we can't afford to be unsure about the
precision of the tracer.
Also, the goal is to have a generic monotonic timestamp readable from
everywhere. Excluding execution contexts doesn't seem like such a great
idea (it just replicates the same problem somewhere else).

Still important for old architectures where PIT is the only available
clock source I guess. However, the clocksource struct should at least 
tell if the time can be read atomically and offer a different API for
atomic vs non atomic read of time source, returning an error if no
atomic time source is available.
