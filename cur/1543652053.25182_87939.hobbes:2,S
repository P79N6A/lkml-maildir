I do not want to create any extra work for you by having your name
in the MAINTAINERS file.  If this is something that you would like to
do, then I would be very please to see your name added as the 
maintainer for the Alpha Architecture.  You do excellent work and
there is nobody that I can think of that is more qualified.
If you do decide to become the maintainer, please keep me in
mind if you need any assistance.  I would be happy to help.
If you decide not to become the 'maintainer', I would really 
appreciate your input and recommendation for someone
to be named as the maintainer.
Best Regards,
--George
