The "just let it wrap" approach will only work if number_of_bytes_at_buf 
is a power of two.  If it isn't, then the FIFO will skip back to zero at 
the wrong place after correctly storing 2^32 bytes.  I'll explain:
S = size of storage buffer
N = 1<<32 (or whatever size int is on a platform)
The hidden assumption is:
   a % S == (a % N) % S
But this is only true if:
   N % S == 0
Or in other words, that S is a power of two less than N.

This will of course always work fine, since S is not involved.

IMHO restricting it to powers of two may not be so bad, and allows us to 
get away with using faster bitwise ANDs instead of modulus operations. 
Most FIFOs are probably power-of-two sizes anyway.  However, if the 
interface exports using any size, it'd better work that way, and not fail 
after working correctly for the first 4GB.
This is a perfect example of why we need a common, well tested 
implementation that all the drivers, etc. can use.  Keep up the excellent 
work :)
