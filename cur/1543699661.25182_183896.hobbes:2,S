hi ,
   thx for the suggestion .  The problem is I have some tools which are only supported by vendors on redhat 7.3 ( i mean with this kernel 2.4.18-3) . I cant change the kernel . So I am looking for a patch I mean add some support for 82801EB in piix.c or pci-irq.c , something like that . I have found some patches in kernelnewbies.org but they all cater to 2.4.20 , the structure of the kernel in drivers/ide is different . Further u go up to 2.4.21EL kernel there is no piix.c , it is replaced by ata_piix.c , I am not able to patch it .Further I have to make it working on 2.4.18-27.7.x also ( that is redhat upgraded kernel ) .

THe problem is this chipset is not recognised in redhat 7.3 , does not get installed ,it cannot find the neither harddrive or cdrom drives ( IDE only not SATA ) . I need it working on redhat 7.3 (2.4.18-3) . Any suggestive patch /work-around will be highly appreciated .
