I would not be surprised if both AMD and Intel are playing some 
"benchmarking games" by trying to select nop's that work badly for the 
other side, and then showing how _their_ new CPU's are so much better by 
having the compilers emit the "preferred" no-ops.
But maybe I'm just too cynical. And I do suspect the Hammer optimization
guide was meant for the 64-bit mode only, because I'm pretty certain even
AMD does badly on prefixes at least in older CPU generations.
