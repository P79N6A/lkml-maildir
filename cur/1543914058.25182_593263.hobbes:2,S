That's right... there is no need to put that into the kernel and
hide this trivial functionality from userspace.

I've read the datasheet.
Your driver is specific for the M41T11 chip as mentioned in your
first mail, isn't it? If any future driver comes up with 8 bits
you wouldn't need to change a generic interface to read/modify/write
these 8 bits, right?

Why do any normalization in the driver? That's what userspace can do
in any way it might be necessary to do.

That behaviour seems also odd to me...
I can increment/decrement by an unknown number and then I get an EINVAL.
And I cannot reset it to some default value easily.
I still don't see any reason to implement relative changes to an otherwise
unknown value if it's possible to give absolute values to work with.
Well, that's my opinion, my five cents... I don't want to get into a lenghtly
discussion... I just used common sense how a interface to a register might
look like and your way of a relative manipulation just looks very uncommon
to me, having seen lot's of drivers.
Best regards,
