My impression is that you and Len are talking at different levels.
I can't speak for Len, but let me try to describe a problem in this area 
I don't know the solution for:
Consider I want to do the following:
1. update my tree daily from your tree
2. include 10 patches per week into my tree
3. ask you once a month to pull from my tree
How should step 1 be done?
In CVS, I'd do a "cvs update -dP ."
In cogito, the equivalent command seems to be "cg-update".
CVS has no problems if I have changed MAINTAINERS in one place and it 
changes daily in your tree in other places, but how do I do the same in 
git/cogito without creating the merges you don't want to see?
The solution might be described somewhere in TFM, but this is the class 
of problems people like me run into when the goal is simply a git tree 
to both track your tree and send changes to you without any interest in 
advanced SCM knowledge.
