Umm... No offense, but
	* all of these questions take a couple of minutes to answer.
	* if you know how to use grep you should be able to find the
answer faster than anybody could reply
	* if you know C the last two questions are non-issue (everyone who
doubts that is welcome to read the register_filesystem() source and see
what arguments do its callers pass to it)
	* it looks suspiciously similar to, pardon me, attempt to cheat on
a quiz.
