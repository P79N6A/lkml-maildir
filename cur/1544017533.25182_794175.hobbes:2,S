The EP93xx has a single register for reading, set and clearing the
states of gpios, so it would have to be read, masked and written. I'm
not sure if that would be quicker than doing a for-loop over the 8-bits
in the register (the EP93xx has 8 register banks of 8 gpios, each with
their own reigster set). I guess that even if it cannot be optimised for
a given architecture, then the standard for-loop method can be used. As
long as it is documented that non-consecutive setting should work so
that arch implementers can get it correct.

Cool, thanks.
