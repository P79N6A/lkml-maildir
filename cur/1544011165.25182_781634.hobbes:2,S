Sounds all sensible. Btrfs already stores the (possibly incomplete)
device tree state in the kernel, which should make things pretty easy
for userspace, compared to other already existing subsystems.
We could have udev maintain a btrfs volume tree:
  /dev/btrfs/
  |-- 0cdedd75-2d03-41e6-a1eb-156c0920a021
  |   |-- 897fac06-569c-4f45-a0b9-a1f91a9564d4 -> ../../sda10
  |   `-- aac20975-b642-4650-b65b-b92ce22616f2 -> ../../sda9
  `-- a1ec970a-2463-414e-864c-2eb8ac4e1cf2
      |-- 4d1f1fff-4c6b-4b87-8486-36f58abc0610 -> ../../sdb2
      `-- e7fe3065-c39f-4295-a099-a89e839ae350 -> ../../sdb1
At the same time, by-uuid/ is created:
  /dev/disk/by-uuid/
  |-- 0cdedd75-2d03-41e6-a1eb-156c0920a021 -> ../../sda10
  |-- a1ec970a-2463-414e-864c-2eb8ac4e1cf2 -> ../../sdb2
  ...
And possibly by-label/:
  /dev/disk/by-label/
  |-- butter-butter -> ../../sda10
  ...
The by-uuid/, by-label/ links always get overwritten by the last
device claiming that name (unless udev rules specify a "link priority"
for specific devices, which might not make sense for btrfs).
With the udev rules that maintain the /dev/btrfs/ tree, we can just
plug in "btrfs -A" calls, to make the device known to the kernel.
If possible, "btrfsctrl -A" could return the updated state of the
in-kernel device tree. If it is complete, we can send out an event to
possibly trigger the mounting. This model should just work fine in
initramfs too.
For recue and recovery cases, it will still be nice to be able to
trigger "scan all devices" code in btrfsctrl (own code or libbklid),
but it should be avoided in any normal operation mode.
