Well, not the _only_ way.  The polling-type txrx_word() calls are
also full duplex.  My point is more that it's bad/inefficient to
incur both IRQ _and_ task switch overheads per word, when it would
be a lot simpler to just have the IRQ handler do its normal job.
(And that's even true if you've turned hard IRQ handlers into threads
for PREEMPT_RT or whatever.  In that case the "IRQ overhead" is a
task switch, but you're still saving _additional_ task switches.)

No more than the usual sort of driver thing.  SPI is a lot simpler
than most hardware, it's just a fancy shift register.  There's not
a lot of configuration possible, and not much can go wrong.

I think of it more as "after first word is received", but they are
the same event ... you can't send a word without receiving one, or
receive one without sending one.  SPI is fundamentally full duplex.
Now, if you have a FIFO as well as a shift register, then yes the
synchronization can get tricky.  It should still be possible to
have the RX and TX buffers be identical though.

I'll disagree on any need for a separate thread.  Kumar's IRQ handler
was already reading the RX byte and storing it.  However, he stored it
in a scratch byte ... rather than putting it right into the RX buffer.
There's no point to incurring extra costs like that (or like the extra
context switch overhead).
