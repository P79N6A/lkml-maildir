In this particular patch (which is an almost verbatim
extraction/renaming of the generic bits of the cpusets code into
container.c) it probably could - but the main patch that adds the
container_group support would lose it since we use kref to refcount
container_group objects, and hence they're freed when their refcount
reaches zero. RCU is still fine for reading the container_group
pointers, but it's no good for updating them, since by the time you
update it it may no longer be your container_group structure, and may
instead be about to be deleted as soon as the other thread's
rcu_synchronize() completes.
