Subject: [PATCH] scsi_execute_async() should add to the tail of the queue

Hello,
scsi_execute_async() has replaced scsi_do_req() a few versions ago, 
but it also incurred a change of behavior. I noticed that over-queuing 
a SCSI device using that function causes I/Os to be starved from 
low-level queuing for no justified reason.
I think it makes much more sense to perserve the original behaviour 
of scsi_do_req() and add the request to the tail of the queue.
