Matti - that is not a very good reason.
No doubt we are able to write software that prepends [FOO]
and then removes all other instances on [FOO].
Many mailing lists do precisely that.
There are advantages: distinguish personal messages from
mailing list messages, and distinguish between different
mailing lists. And disadvantages - maybe only one:
sacrificing valuable Subject: line space.
I would not be against a [LK] label.
