I was specifically told by David Miller that we are not to break binary
compatibility within a 2.4 release.  Such things had to wait until 2.5 
or later.  We can not require a user to upgrade their ifenslave within a 2.4
series kernel just to keep using the same functionality they were using in 
2.4.1.  Obviously we can require them to upgrade in order to keep using
new functionality.  So the _OLD stuff needs to stay in the 2.4 kernel.  If
this was brought up in an earlier thread, then I just missed it.
