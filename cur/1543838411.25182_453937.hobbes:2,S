NVIDIA, CK804 chipset.
And the disks are on the sata part, and are found as e g and i so if
they are in legacy mode, it would make me suspect that the disks believe
they are on separate channels, and the performance characteristics appear
to confirm that as the disks don't seem to interfere with each other.
