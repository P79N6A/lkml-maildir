hello ,
so i decided to install linux on one of these beasts.
Anyways , redhat installs fine ( debian doesnt have a booting floppy for
2.2.12 that has raid support built in, and i am not about to make one
myself). So after looking into it i have some questions:
1. why is the array a block device rather than a scsi controller ? other
arrays are under scsi
2. Is there a userspace utility that allows the raid array to notify
 through syslog ) of any failures restores etc etc. I yanked out a 9 gig
drive out of a mirror set tofay and it continued working, but nowhere could
i find a sign of the drive being dead. On top of that i also hoped for the
drive to restore on its own when i plugged it back in. In turn i had to
reboot and choose f1 or f2 at the raid bios test phase ( f1 was recover the
drive , f2 was leave it as is and boot up) . Under windows NT the driver
dumps all alarms in event viewer so you can actually see whats going on. I
am sure this is not a big thing to do, especially considering how powerfull
this array is and could be when used under linux. every single scsi driver i
ever used dumps the smallest scsi error to syslog.
i hope that the talking between the array and the driver can be improved in
2.3/4 or is it already done ?
