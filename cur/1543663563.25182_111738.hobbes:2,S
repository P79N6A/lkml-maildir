dmesg output follows, tail laft few lines are the result of a *manual* 
load of the module. During boot the modules was loaded twice and unloaded 
after some reset actions, dropping all devices. This was after I 
disconnected the tape drive (yes termination was okay, 2.4.19 and 
2.5.61-ac1 have no proble with the CD).
System is RH7.3 install with Rusty modutils 0.9.9pre. Stable with 2.4.19 
or 2.5.{59,61-ac1}.

  Having the feature freeze for Linux 2.5 on Hallow'een is appropriate,
since using 2.5 kernels includes a lot of things jumping out of dark
corners to scare you.
