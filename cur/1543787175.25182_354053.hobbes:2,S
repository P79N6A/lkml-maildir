01_i386_and_x86_64_implement-dma_broken_dac.patch
	CK804 PCI bridge fails to forward DAC commands from the
	secondary bus to the primary, which is required by PCI
	specification from ver1.1.  This patch implements
	dma_broken_dac() which tests whether there is any such bridge
	among parents of a given device.
