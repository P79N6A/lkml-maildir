It should be the lowest domain level that spans both this_cpu and
push_cpu, and has the SD_BALANCE flag set. We could possibly be a bit
more general here, but so long as nobody is coming up with weird and
wonderful sched_domains schemes, push_cpu should give you all the info
needed.

Hmm yeah. It is a bit tricky. We don't currently do exceptionally well
at this sort of "balancing over multiple domains" very well in the
periodic balancer either.
But at this stage I prefer to not get overly complex, and allow some
imperfect task movement, because it should rarely be a problem, and is
much better than it was before. The main place where it can go wrong
is multi-level NUMA balancing, where moving a task twice (between
different nodes) can cause more problems.
