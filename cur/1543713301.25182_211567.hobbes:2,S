It checks that the network card has returned the buffer to the host computer.
The code will loop in the irq handler until every buffer submitted
for Tx is processed
- it is gross;
- it is not robust;
- I assume that's why the driver sucks cpu like hell on high Tx traffic;
- ... but it is not faulty.

In Linus's current tree, I doubt it: assume the host has submitted a few
packets for Tx and the network card issue an interrupt for the first one 
whereas the second descriptor still belongs to the network card -> boom.
