My Athlon XP desktop doesn't support frequency scaling but has working
ACPI C-states (at least under Windows) so will run as cool as 31C when
idle (with the CPUIdle utility).  Most of the heat comes from the hard
drives anyway, but that's a different story.
This seems pretty cool to me, how much more power does frequency scaling
save over that, assuming you suspend after 5-10 minutes of inactivity
anyway?
