Subject: [patch] do_no_pfn handler

Linus,
Attached is a repost of the do_no_pfn handler patch. This version
includes all the changes that were suggested after my previous posting
(the order of checking ->nopage before ->nopfn and Nick's suggestion
to check for others refaulting the same).  The patch is needed for the
MSPEC driver and Bjorn and Carsten have expressed strong interest in
using this interface for other things as well.
You mentioned earlier that you preferred an alternative approach, do
you still feel that given the additional interest from other Bjorn and
Carsten? If this is still the case, I'd love to get some guidance as
to what that should be.
I had hoped to get this in before 2.6.17, dunno if that is too late or
would you prefer to see it in -mm first?
Thanks,
Jes
Implement do_no_pfn() for handling mapping of memory without a struct
page backing it. This avoids creating fake page table entries for
regions which are not backed by real memory.
