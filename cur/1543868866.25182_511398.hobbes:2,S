Your patch seems to improve the situation a little bit, but the numbers still 
look weird, especially for swap-in, which gets progressively slower.
RAM 512mb , SWAP 1G
#mount -t tmpfs -o size=1G none /dev/shm
#time cat /dev/full > /dev/shm/x.dmp

#time cat /dev/shm/x.dmp > /dev/null
58sec
#time cat /dev/shm/x.dmp > /dev/null
72sec
#time cat /dev/shm/x.dmp > /dev/null
85sec
#time cat /dev/shm/x.dmp > /dev/null

#time cat /dev/shm/x.dmp > /dev/null
99sec
Thanks!
