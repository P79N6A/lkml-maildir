Hello!
> Show me a linker script that can link together bootsect.o and bsetup.o.
I don't have enough time to experiment with it at this very moment
and I admit that the linker bugs you've mentioned make it impossible,
but the objdump solution I mentioned (and tried a couple of minutes ago)
works and although it isn't perfect, it's lovely compared to the
"-start" hack.
				Have a nice fortnight
