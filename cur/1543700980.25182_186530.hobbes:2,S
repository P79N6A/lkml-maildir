I agree, that's one of the reasons I posted at all. Little things like 
this can make a big difference, even though I've seen a lot of users not 
notice the little icon and have to be told about it.
Maybe when the icon appears have a tool-tip that pops up and says 
something like "your USB device is ready for user at /mnt/usb, click 
here when you're done" or something like that to make it more noticable 
that they shouldn't just yank it.
But I seem to be getting OT for this list...

Perhaps synchronous was the wrong term =) But it does atleast seem to do 
less buffering for removable devices or I could just be fooled by 
something else slowing it down.
