Hi,
	I have compiled a 2.4.18 kernel (and other minor versions too) and when I 
choose it in lilo it just reboots, theres no output to the console at all.
	I dont know what Im doing wrong, it does that whether I choose the Dell 
Laptop option in the "Processor type and features" section.
	If you need any other information about the hw or kernel config, just ask.
Thanks
