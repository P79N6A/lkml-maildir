Unfortunately, there are plenty of reasons why you might want to store
a filesystem image on disk besides for backup purposes:
	* Regression tests --- I have some 70+ small filesystem images
		used for e2fsck's regression test suite.  (I am always
		amazed how many filesystem fsck programs don't have
		regression test suites.)
	* Initial ram-disk images
	* Image files for qemu or user-mode-linux
... and probably many more.  None of these are safe to store on a
reiserfs3 filesystem if you're worried about fsck being robust after a
disk failure.
Funny thing.  When I tell system administrators who have been around
the block more than a few times about this particular "feature" of
reiserfs3, they usually very quickly decide that it's time to switch
to another filesystem.....
