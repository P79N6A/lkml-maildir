I've never seen a kernel yet where this **doesn't** happen at least
occasionally - Linux, Solaris, HP, or otherwise. It can be caused by
erratic drift in the system clock caused by high load, as well as by
a congested network/internet leading to irregular delays in polling,
as well as a number of other factors. So I expect to see this on
occasion. I would only worry if you see it very often - e.g. more than
once or twice an hour, or if you never see a "synchronized to..."
message within a few (<10) minutes after a "synchronization lost".
