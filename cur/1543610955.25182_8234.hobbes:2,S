This seems to confirm my doubts about Quantum lct drives' sanity. I'm
having two drives: a Quantum CX 13G, and a Maxtor 40G@5400. Both work with
UDMA33 (mb doesn't support more). When i put a QUANTUM FIREBALL lct20 20G
drive in my rack, random lockups occur. I'd put all Quantum LCT drives on
the blacklist!
