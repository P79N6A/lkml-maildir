Adrian,
You said earlier you're looking at smaller allnoconfig kernels.
One thing I noticed recently that realtime pi futexes are always
enabled and that pulls in a lot of other code (like the plists) 
Userland needs to handle them not being available anyways for older
kernels.
Might be worth looking into turning that into a CONFIG.
