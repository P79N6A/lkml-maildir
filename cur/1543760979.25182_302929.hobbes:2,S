Will do.  The main problem here is X86, as other architectures either
don't care, or have enough interrupt lines.  And the people who are
paying me for this kind of thing all run IA64....
What I really want to do is deprivilege the driver code as much as
possible.  Whatever a driver does, the rest of the system should keep
going.  That way malicious or buggy drivers can only affect the
processes that are trying to use the device they manage.  Moreover, it
should be possible to kill -9 a driver, then restart it, without the
rest of the system noticing more than a hiccup.  To do this,
step one is to run the driver in user space, so that it's subject to
the same resource management control as any other process.  Step two,
which is a lot harder, is to connect the driver back into the kernel
so that it can be shared.  Tun/Tap can be used for network devices,
but it's really too slow -- you need zero-copy and shared notification.
