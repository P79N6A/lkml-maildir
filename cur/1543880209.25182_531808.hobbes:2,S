That helped me a lot at that time. At every context switch was sampling 
critical scheduler parameters for both entering and exiting task (and 
associated timestamps). Then the data was collected through a 
/dev/idontremember from userspace for analysis. It'd very useful to have 
it those days, to study what really happens under the hook 
(scheduler internal parameters variations and such) when those wierd loads 
make the scheduler unstable.
