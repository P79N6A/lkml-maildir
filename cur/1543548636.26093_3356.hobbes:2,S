Indeed. It's a shame because 2.4 is gaining a relatively complete
"Enterprise checklist". It's a further shame because it's a non-intrusive
patch.
Yes, detailled I/O usage figures _are_ an Enterprise requirement. And no,
we don't have good enough statistics yet. A decent DBA will _require_
figures like % utilisation, average request service latency, average queue
depth, etc.
Cheers
