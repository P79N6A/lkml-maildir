This is what your BIOS sets up.  The main output is connected to the
docking station.  That's why "Front" (a silly name for ALC262; it
should read "Line Out", maybe will be renamed in later versions)
switch doesn't work.
OTOH, all outputs (speaker, headphone and line-outs) use the same DAC,
and this is controlled via line-out volume, i.e. "Front" volume.

This must be the behavior of the codec chip...  Did "Front" volume 0
mute in the earlier version?  If not, it actually doesn't mute with
the lowest volume.  Use the master switch to mute.
Anyway, attach the alsa-info.sh output at the moment Master volume is
zero.

Yep.  For the perfect solution, you'd need to create a static "patch"
for this particular model instead of auto-configuration.  Then you can
adjust everything as you like.
