Yeah, that's what I'm really trying to avoid for Samba.
We're currently using the xattr interface for DOS attributes,
and soon for NT ACL support, but it doesn't really fit as
a streams interface (no lseek() support) although someone in
HP coded up a test interface to NT streams that map into xattrs
(most of the streams in a Word file for instance are quite
small) - but I really don't want to have to do this :-).
