Sure, but what I'm not clear on is why, if I've done a
prctl(PR_SET_KEEPCAPS, 1) before the setfsuid, I still lose the
CAP_FS_MASK perms.  I see the special case handling in
cap_task_post_setuid().  I'm sure there was a reason for it, but
this is a piece of the capability implementation I don't understand
right now.
I would send in a patch to make it honor current->keep_capabilities,
but I have a feeling there was a good reason not to do so in the
first place.

If it were really the equivalent then I could keep my capabilities :)
after changing it.

May be, but just using fsuid at this point stops me from enabling user
mounts under /share if /share is chmod 000 (which it is).
