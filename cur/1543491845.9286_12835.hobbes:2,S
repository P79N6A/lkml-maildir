To see the IRQ actually grabbed, you either have to be in X or
od `od /dev/ttySx` (to keep the port open).
If you find it's using the same IRQ as the disk, you can usually move
something to another slow so it has its own IRQ. I have found, that
if you put a bunch of cards in PCI slots, one after another, the
BIOS on some machines connects them all to IRQ10 NotGood(tm).
