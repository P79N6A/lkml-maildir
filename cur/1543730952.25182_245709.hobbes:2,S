Yes, every inode can have different operation vectors.  Which is the
smallest possible object the VFS knows about.

Again, your confusing upper and lower plugins.  For things happening
below the pagecache you could register different address_space
operations which sometimes makes sense.  But you want e.g. different
inode_operations for directories vs symlinks vs files.
Please read through some linux filesystem code, okay :)
