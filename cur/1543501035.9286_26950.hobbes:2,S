That's rather unfair to Dean, who has been following the work some of
us have been doing on fast server core event loops.  Zach Brown's
phhttpd server is an example of a lot of tricks Linux can do to
improve performance, and Dean has most definitely been tracking
this work with a view to optimising Apache in general and Apache on
Linux in particular.
