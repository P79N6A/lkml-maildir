Just a question; if it has already been answered or is somehow
irrelevant I apologize for my ignorance in advance...   :)
Why not add Linux Software RAID (md) support as well?  That way we'd
finally be able to get rid of the MD-outside-DM code.
And maybe kill the kernel auto-detection of MD devices while we're at it
(ok, that's probably 2.7 material as it will break a *lot* of systems)
