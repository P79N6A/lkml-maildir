i have released the 2.6.17-rc6-rt1 tree, which can be downloaded from 
the usual place:
   
http://redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/
the biggest change was the port to 2.6.17-rc6, and the moving to John's 
latest and greatest GTOD queue. Most of the porting was done by Thomas 
Gleixner (thanks Thomas!). We also picked up the freshest genirq queue 
from -mm and the freshest PI-futex patchset. There are also lots of ARM 
fixups and enhancements from Deepak Saxena and Daniel Walker.
if we accidentally dropped some fix in the process then please complain. 
x86 and x86_64 build and boot, but some initial rough edges are to be 
expected. Deepak, your ARM-GTOD patches are included but not tested yet.
to build a 2.6.17-rc6-rt1 tree, the following patches should be applied:
  
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.16.tar.bz2
  
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/testing/patch-2.6.17-rc6.bz2
