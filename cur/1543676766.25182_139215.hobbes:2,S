I can back that. In fact I have some SIS-based motherboards that do not run
without the acpi patch.
My personal opinion on the topic "what to put in 2.4.22-pre1?" is:
1) aic (because you can kick Justins' a** if it does not work out, and get rid
of any complaints for what you do yourself to the aic code)
2) acpi (because the code has already gone through some significant testing and
looks promising).
So I guess I would just do the opposite of your current statement. Remember, you
have a chance to win 500 bucks, don't let it go ;-)

Stephan
