There is no point in migrating something if you cannot reach the 
destination. If the policy zone is not allowed by an allocation then the 
page cannot be migrated because (on 32 bit NUMA) there is only a single 
ZONE_NORMAL on the system. A different node requires a HIGHMEM allocation!

Hmmm..... How about a VM_DONTMIGRATE flag instead? That would be easy to 
check and could be set by a device that must have all pages of the address
space conforming to the gfp mask.
Or more general
VM_STRICT_ALLOC?

We have enough flags I think.
