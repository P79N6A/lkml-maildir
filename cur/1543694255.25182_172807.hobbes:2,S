Hi,
My Cisco Aironet 350 Series PCMCIA network card does no longer work with the
latest 2.4 and 2.6 kernels. For 2.4.23 I have been able to identify the point
in time at which things broke. 2.4.23-pre1 still works and -pre2 does not.
The card is unable to acquire an IP address via DHCP and also doesn't seem to
receive any networking traffic at all with -pre2 and later.
Looking at the 2.4 changelog it seems that the following patch introduced
the problem.
MT> Summary of changes from v2.4.23-pre1 to v2.4.23-pre2
MT> ============================================
MT> <javier:tudela.mad.ttd.net>:
MT>   o [wireless airo] add support for MIC and latest firmwares
Do you have any idea what is going wrong here? If you need more information
to narrow down the problem, just ask.
Regards,
-Udo.
