We've got a fairly nice hash table interface in BitKeeper that we'd be 
happy to provide under the GPL.  I've always thought it would be cool
to have it in the kernel, we use it everywhere.

will let you browse it.  The general interface is gdbm() like and there
are both file backed and memory backed versions.  It was designed to be
useful in small and large configs, you can get a hash into 128 bytes if
I recall correctly.
