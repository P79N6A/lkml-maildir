I think doing this through procfs might be reasonable, but a kernel
command line option would be absolutely mandatory.  If things are
crappy you might not get to the point of fidding with /proc.
Also, I really think SysRq has nothing to do under "Kernel
Hacking/Kernel Debugging".  More than anything else it's a system
administration feature.
