FWIW, we've had that patch in Fedora (most of the time), since 2.6.13,
and I don't recall seeing any other serial breakage ports (on this,
or any UART for that matter).

Still, leaving a patch out in the cold for 11 months, when we know it
at least makes things work for some users strikes me as wrong.
If we took this approach with every driver, we'd end up not supporting
the majority of things we support today.
