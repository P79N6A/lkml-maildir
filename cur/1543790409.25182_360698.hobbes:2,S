Subject: [patch 0/3] pci: store PCI_INTERRUPT_PIN in pci_dev

Store the value of PCI_INTERRUPT_PIN in the pci_dev structure for use
later.  This is useful for pci hotplug.  When a device is "surprise"
removed, the pci config space is no longer available.  However,
the pin value is needed to correctly disable the irq for the device.
