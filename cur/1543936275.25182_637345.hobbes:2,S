You're right, I normally wouldn't, but since someone else already had, I
figured it would be alright.

Actually some of the added functionality (calc_num_ports) is required
for
device 0x0023 and will be necessary for future devices (should someone 
want to add the VID/PID of a new device it will likely require the added
support).
So my preference would be to please include the other changes in the 
2.6.24 release.
Thanks,
