Ingo, you likely will not believe, but your mails are ones of the
several which I always read several times to get every bit of it :)
I clearly understand your point of view, it is absoutely clear and shine
for me. But... I can not agree with it.
Because of theoretical point of view and practical one concerned my
measurements. It is not pure speculation, which one can expect, but real
life comparison of kernel/user scheduling with pure userspace one (like
in own M:N threading lib or concurrent prgramming language like erlang).
For me (and probably _only_ for me), it is enough to show that some lib
shows 10 times faster rescheduling to start developing own, so I pointed
to it in a discussion.

That are only rethorical words as you have understood I bet, I meant that the
whole process of getting readiness notification from kevent is way tooo
much faster than resheduling of the new process/thread to handle that IO.
The whole process of switching from one process to another can be as fast
as bloody hell, but all other details just kill the thing.
I do not know, what exact line ends up with problem, but having thousands
of threads, rescheduling itself, results in slower performance than
userspace rescheduling. Then I interpolate it to our IO test case.

I do not arue that I'm absolutely right.
I just point that I tested some cases and that tests ends up with
completely broken behaviour for micro-thread design (even besides the
case of thousand of new thread creation/reuse per second, which itself
does not look perfect).
I do not even ever try to say that threadlets suck (although I do believe
that it is in some cases, at leat for now :) ), I just point that
rescheduling overhead happens to be tooo big when it comes to
benchmarks I ran (where you never replied too, but that does not matter
after all :).
It can end up with (handwaving) broken syscall wrapper implementation,
or with anything else. Absolutely.
I never ever tried to say that scheduler's code is broken - I just show
my own tests which resulted in the situation, when many working threads
can end up with timings worse than some other case.
Register/tlb/whatever is just a speculation about _possible _ root of
the problem. I did not investigate problem enough - I just decided to
implement different library. Shame on me for that, since I never showed 
what exactly is a root of the problem, but for _me_ it is enough, so I'm
trying to share it with you and other developers.

Suparna showed its problems - although on an older version.

Ugh, Ingo, do not think absolutely...
I did it. And it is slow.

I can only laugh on that, Ingo :)
If you will be in Moscow, I will buy you a beer, just drop me a mail.
What we are talking about, Ingo, kevent and IO in thread contexts, 
or userspace vs. kernelspace scheduling?
Kevent can be broken as hell, it can be stupid application, which does
not work at all - it is one of the possible theories.
Practice however shows that it is not true.
Anyway, if we are talking about kevents and micro-threads, that is one
point, if we are talking about possible overhead of rescheduling - it is
another topic.

I thought I showed it several times already.
Anyway:

That is an initial step, which shows that rescheduling of threads (
I DO NOT say about problems in sched.c, Ingo, that would be somehow
stupid, althogh can be right) has some overhead comapred to userspace
rescheduling. If so, it can be eliminated or reduced.
Second (COMPELTELY DIFFERENT STARTING POINT).
If rescheduling has some overhead, is it possible to reduce it using
different model for IO? So I created kevent (as you likely do not know,
original idea was a bit differnet - network AIO, but results is quite good).
