I think HW checksumming and SG are independent. Either one of them should
not require the other one in any context.
Zero copy sendfile() does not require HW checksum to do zero copy, right?
If HW checksum is present, then you get some extra performance as a bonus.
(hmm, one could make SG mandatory and the devices that don't support it can 
 implement it in their driver. Just an idea)
