Lee,
Thanks for the reply.
We have tried moving my network connection to a new switch, replaced the
cables, but still getting that error.
What do I do with that command options 3c59x full_duplex=1, where do I
put it?  Bare with me as I am a newbie.
Thanks,
Joe

Um... did you check Documentation/networking/vortex.txt?
261	Transmit error, Tx status register 82
262	-------------------------------------
263	
264	This is a common error which is almost always caused by another
host on
265	the same network being in full-duplex mode, while this host is
in
266	half-duplex mode.  You need to find that other host and make it
run in
267	half-duplex mode or fix this host to run in full-duplex mode.
268	
269	As a last resort, you can force the 3c59x driver into
full-duplex mode
270	with
271	
272		options 3c59x full_duplex=1
273	
274	but this has to be viewed as a workaround for broken network
gear and
275	should only really be used for equipment which cannot
autonegotiate.
