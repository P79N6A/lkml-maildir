"My car is blue, that's why it rains tommorrow." 
I can very well understand why some people refuse to talk to you, but I cannot
really see the relation to OSS in general.
Really, have you listened to yourself lately: "Commercial distros do not like
to benefit from OSS." ??? 
How do you define their primary goal, arguing with Joerg Schilling, or what?

Has there been one single day in your life where you accepted someone elses
opinion, differing from yours ?
It is obvious _for me_, that programmers at SuSE think your software needs some
changes and try to improve it according to their ideas. It is _your_ problem
that you cannot accept their point of view, not theirs'. 
If you see GPL violation, sue them. If you don't want your software to be
changed in any way, don't use GPL.
