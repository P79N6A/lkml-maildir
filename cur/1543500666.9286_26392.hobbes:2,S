A modified user-space NFS server might do what you want (essentially,
re-export the WebDAV filesystem as an NFS filesystem). But good luck
supporting all the extra file properties that DAV gives you in a clear
manner (every file as a directory, perhaps, with properties represented as
files under there, with a special file named "data" or somesuch that
represents the data associated with that object? Just a thought...).
Alternatively, you might look at the virtual filesystem work done with
Midnight Commander and GNOME; the following URL has a brief overview:

Those would be good proof-of-concept designs, before going about bloating
the kernel with something that might not end up being incredibly useful.
Show that it works, then integrate with the kernel if a userspace setup
proves to be unacceptable.
