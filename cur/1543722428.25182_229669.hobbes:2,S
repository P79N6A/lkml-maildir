Yes, looks good and works for me.
We also need a decent way to run scripts/extract-ikconfig and build
scripts/binoffset.  I recall that SuSE has/had a 'make cloneconfig'
once upon a time (in 2.4.x).  I've begun on a 'make getconfig' (but
I can rename it to 'cloneconfig' if that's more appropriate), but
it needs some more work (i.e., not yet working).  [patch below]
Thanks,
