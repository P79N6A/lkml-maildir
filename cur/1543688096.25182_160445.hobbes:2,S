    Hi all :))
    I've noticed that in the make config part of 2.4.22, when looking
at the help for the ACPI option, it says that is EXPERIMENTAL, but I
don't have the 'EXPERIMENTAL' flag set in my config file, so I don't
want to be asked about experimental features:
#
# Code maturity level options
#
# CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL is not set
    Is ACPI no longer experimental or it (wrongly) doesn't depend on
'CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL' to be set?
