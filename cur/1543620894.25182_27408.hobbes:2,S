Hi!
This makes gcc survive... adding volatile everywhere ;-).
int blk_ioctl(volatile kdev_t dev, volatile unsigned int cmd, volatile
unsigned long arg)
{
        volatile request_queue_t *q;
        volatile struct gendisk *g;
        volatile u64 ullval = 0;
        volatile int intval, *iptr;
        volatile unsigned short usval;
