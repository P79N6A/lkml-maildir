No it doesn't, sorry.

You need to sleep until your release function gets called.  Take a look
at the cpufreq code for an example of this (also the i2c core does
this.)

release() is called when the last reference to this device is dropped.
When it is called it is then safe to do the following:
	- free the memory of the device
	- unload the module of the device
So an empty release() function is the wrong thing to do in 99.99% of the
situations in the kernel (the one exception seems to be the mca release
function that recently got added for use when the bus is doing probing
logic.)
Does this help out?
