Sorry.  I read the list from a web site that does not show the
cc lists.  I'll try to cc more people from the relevant discussions
though.  On the other hand, I've dropped Linus from this message,
as it just points to something he previously said.

This message from Linus seemed to imply that git was going to get
its own 3-way merge code:
