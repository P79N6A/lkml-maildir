hello,
I've a TX4 150 card and encounter the following effects :
->"shorts" files (<1Mo) are copied at 35Mo/s av
->"long" files (>1Mo) are "burst" copied (ie a big "burst" then hangs, 
burst, hangs) this has the following effects :
1) average fall back to 12Mo/s
2) systems "hangs" (mouse, keyboard behave like a 100% used cpu) but cpu 
usage is still slow
3) mplayer reset the streams every second (cpu usage still low)
this is 1-2 week that I have this issue, but can't find where it comes 
from...... yesterday by chance when I loaded sata-promise I noticed 
"write through" this remembered be some issue I go when I first had the 
sata board, making a short research made me remember :
DISABLE THE BOARD CACHE! on windows this is the same when cache is 
enabled : performance drops, system interactive is awfull....
this should be made an option in module
