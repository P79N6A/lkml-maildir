On this particular subject, I should point out that there is a standard 
for network bootroms on i386 platforms -- PXE.  Most PXE implementations 
out there suck rocks, but that's orthogonal -- they're still a lot 
easier to use than coming up with your own (and they will boot, ahem, 
other operating systems as well.)
Now, PXE is pretty limited usually boots a second-stage bootloader
That being said, it would be great to get an Open Source PXE 
implementation and driver collection.  I was hoping NILO 
(
http://www.nilo.org/
) would be it, but it seems to not be going 
anywhere.  I was for a while considering trying to turn Etherboot into a 
PXE kit.
