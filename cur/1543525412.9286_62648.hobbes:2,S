I am attempting to reproduce and debug according to your suggestions.
Also, in the failed hunks when applying your patch to 2.2.14aa7, there
is a new function "mark_buffer_protected" in include/linux/fs.h.  I think
it should also have a conditional_schedule but am not sure whether it
needs mark_buffer_highprio or not?
