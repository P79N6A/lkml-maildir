I have not saved the other 2 oopses. All I remember is that they were also in 
kjournald. I have tried to make my machine crash again, but I have had no 
luck so far. I will post a new oops if it happens again. The same machine 
(minus the HD) was very stable on 2.4 and using ext2, but I have switched to 
2.6 and ext3 when I bought the 80GB HD.
