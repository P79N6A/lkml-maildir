hi,
while fooling around with 2.6.15-rt16 i got a couple ( ~330 ) of BUG()s,
which i caught via netconsole
http://www.snake-basket.de/linux-2.6.15-rt16_bug_party.log
A grep shows the BUG()s fall into these categories:
BUG: scheduling with  irqs disabled: insmod/0x00000000/8370
BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context insmod(8370) at mm/slab.c:2134
insmod/7573[CPU#0]: BUG in up_mutex at kernel/rt.c:2246
insmod/7573[CPU#0]: BUG in ____up_mutex at kernel/rt.c:1583
BUG: lock wait_list not initialized?
i was trying to fuzz the ioctl() interface, and assumed it might
be a good idea to load as many modules as possible, so i did a
	"for file in */*.ko; do insmod $file; done"
When i noticed the number of BUG()s i did a
	"lsmod | cut -f1 -d " " | xargs rmmod"
which finally switched the box off. In case .config is of
interest just let me know.
Greetings, Eric Sesterhenn
