Subject: [PATCH] kernel profiling module v0.4
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

A new release is available from htt`p://oss.sgi.com/projects/kernprof/.
The main incentive for this release it to change the major and minor numbers
for profiling devices so they comply with what is now in devices.txt.  In
addition, this release ports the module to 2.3.34 and adds call count
profiling (similar to what is found in IKD).
