This requests level/low for SCI on IRQ9

Active:1)
This indicates that we set IRQ9 to level/low, as requested.
Though 2.6.0 lacks the print_IO_APIC patch, so you'd need to apply this
and re-collect dmesg to really confirm the IOAPIC is programmed
correctly:
http://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/lenb/acpi/patches/release/2.6.0-test9/
If you boot with pci=noacpi, does the system run properly (including
/proc/interrupts showing ACPI interrupts when you, say, press the power
button)

Though I'd love to be wrong, I think this one is a different failure. 
Please file a new one per below.  Would also be good to verify that the
latest 2.4 kernel does the same thing.
thanks,
