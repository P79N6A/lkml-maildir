Hi Jeremy!
	You're thinking of it in a convoluted way, by converting to offsets
from the per-cpu section, then converting it back.  How about this
explanation: the local cpu's versions are offset from where the compiler
thinks they are by __per_cpu_offset[cpu].  We set the segment base to
__per_cpu_offset[cpu], so "%gs:per_cpu__foo" gets us straight to the
local cpu version.  __per_cpu_offset[cpu] is always positive (kernel
image sits at bottom of kernel address space).

__per_cpu_start is large, yes.  But there's no reason to use it in
address calculation.  The second half of your statement is not correct.

I think you're thinking of TLS relocations?  I don't use them...
