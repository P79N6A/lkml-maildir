This information confuses me. These places are not supposed to be the
ones where the locks were actually acquired, are they?

Or maybe it's older. Nodemgr takes class->subsys.rwsem and
device.bus->subsys.rwsem. It always did. Could there be a change in
driver core which makes this recursive? Or has it always been recursive?
For example,
static void nodemgr_update_pdrv(struct node_entry *ne)
{
	struct unit_directory *ud;
	struct hpsb_protocol_driver *pdrv;
	struct class *class = &nodemgr_ud_class;
	struct class_device *cdev;
	down_read(&class->subsys.rwsem);
	list_for_each_entry(cdev, &class->children, node) {
		ud = container_of(cdev, struct unit_directory, class_dev);
		if (ud->ne != ne || !ud->device.driver)
			continue;
		pdrv = container_of(ud->device.driver, struct hpsb_protocol_driver,
driver);
		if (pdrv->update && pdrv->update(ud)) {
			down_write(&ud->device.bus->subsys.rwsem);
			device_release_driver(&ud->device);
			up_write(&ud->device.bus->subsys.rwsem);
		}
	}
	up_read(&class->subsys.rwsem);
}
Miles,
perhaps you should rather unapply all 1394 patches at once.
git-ieee1394.patch is alas the lowermost patch of a stack of dependent
patches. I somehow expect that the "possible recursive locking" persists
even if all the 1394 patches were removed.
Thanks in advance,
