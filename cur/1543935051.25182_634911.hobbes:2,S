Thanks for all comments. I was in vacations until today, and I'll
repost a new version that address all your comments
soon (that's why I'm not answering each of them individually now, have
to look carefully)

Essentially, they don't need it, because they only touch
globally-visible variables (visible to the guest).
So it's more of an stylish thing. Using the vcpu in the signature can
have only one harm:
It needs the caller to also have a pointer to a vcpu, so we may end up
using it everywhere, like a domino fall.
Alternatively, in such functions that don't currently receive a vcpu
(nor they need to), we can convention to always pass
lg->vcpus[0] to lgread, kill_guest, etc. Which one do you prefer?
