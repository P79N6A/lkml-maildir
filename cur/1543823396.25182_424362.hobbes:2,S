Indeed this patch breaks class_device_add in the success case...
Andrew, maybe you want to put this in the hot-fixes directory for
2.6.17-rc1-mm4, as the problem hits all drivers which register with a
class.
Fix class_device_add success case after
gregkh-driver-driver-core-class_device_add-needs-error-checks.patch
broke it. class_dev was no more put and class_name was no more freed
before leaving. The former caused locks on driver removal (class_dev
usage count could never be 0.)
This fix should be folded into
gregkh-driver-driver-core-class_device_add-needs-error-checks.patch
