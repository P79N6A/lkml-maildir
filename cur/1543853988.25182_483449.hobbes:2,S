Kernel-level or userspace? IBM certainly used to sell bay-mounted hard 
drives, and while it's possible for a user to pull one out while the 
machine is suspended, I suspect that the general use case is probably 
for it to carry on being used.
Possibly what's needed is something like Apple's nullfs - force unmount 
the drive on suspend, and put a nullfs there instead. On resume, if the 
drive is still there, remount it. If not, userspace applications get 
upset about the missing drive but no data is lost. The downside to this 
approach would be trying to figure out how to get the drive remounted 
before the rest of userspace starts trying to scribble over it again...
