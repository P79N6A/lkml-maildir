Minor note - static global variables are already zero initialized, so no
need for the following bit of the patch (which is also bad if MAX_CTLR
is not 8):
-static ctlr_info_t *hba[MAX_CTLR];
+static ctlr_info_t *hba[MAX_CTLR] =
+       { NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL };
For future reference, you'd want something like "hda[MAX_CTRL] = { NULL, };"
(assuming you are initializing a local array) which should do the right thing
(it initializes the rest of the array as zero).
Cheers, Andreas
