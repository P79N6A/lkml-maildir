Yes.  It broke into small pieces against the testsuite.  I know that
Linux kernel types generally don't consider that a problem 8)
So I rewrote it yesterday, so now it passes the testsuite.  I also added
a test.  It's in 3.2-pre4: if there are no more requests/bugs in the
next couple of days, I'll make that 3.3.
Thanks for the prodding!
Rusty.
