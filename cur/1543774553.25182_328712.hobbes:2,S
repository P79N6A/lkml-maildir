They do.  Reiser4's EAs can look like any other object -- files,
folders, symlinks, whatever.  This is important, especially for
transparency.
For one thing, can I access a Beagle search as a folder?

Well, ideally, I'd like to see people stop bickering, come up with
something better than sys_reiser4, add an emulation layer for xattrs and
mark them obsolete.
But I don't speak for Namesys.

No, that's the beauty of these "EAs" in Reiser4.  The API is standard
write(2) commands.  sys_reiser4 supposedly implements an interface to
make this scale better, but otherwise have the same semantics.  And who
said anything about proprietary compression?  I think we were planning
on the kernel's zlib, though we might have been planning to make it a
bit more seekable...

So, the API becomes something like:
cat crypto/inflated/foo		# transparently decompressed
cat crypto/raw/foo.gz		# raw, gzip-compressed
Another possibility, if you like file-as-a-directory:
cat foo.gz			# raw
cat foo.gz/inflated		# decompressed
One could easily imagine things like these two potentially equivalent
commands:
cp foo bar.zip/
zip bar foo
The whole point is to have less userland tools, not more.  I'm not
saying we move zip into the kernel, just that the user now has one less
command to remember.
But, back to reality.  file-as-directory probably won't happen, at least
not for awhile, so imagine more along the lines of my first example.

About the same, only now you have a key file that you write to in order
to unlock the decrypted files.

Not really.
More like, every app that cares to has generalized knowledge, if that.

I could say the same of my stuff, but lots of people seem to disagree
with me, or at least fail to see it.  I guess I can say the same of your
comments.

They do keep asking for specifically what they need to do to put this
stuff in VFS.  Or am I wrong?
Or maybe it should be obvious to them?
