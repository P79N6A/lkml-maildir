Yes, that's right.
In this case suspend_hc() is being called anyways, so
the controller *is* in the suspended state.
suspend_hc() and wakeup_hc() are spinning back
and forth forever.
For some reason I thought this was firing without
a call to suspend_hc(), but I verified it with printks.
I tried it both with is_suspended, and again testing
USBCMD_EGSM in the command register (Greg's patch)
with same results.
So it is a good check to add to qualify USBSTS_RD,
but in this case it looks like the mainboard implementation
is FUBAR and bogus resume messages are being
recognized by the controller.
Is there some transient period after setting USBCMD_EGSM
before which the controller is not officially in the
suspended state that might cause a spurious
USBSTS_RD indication? (seems unlikely)

You are right (IMO) that it is correct and should be added,
and you are also right in that it does not solve this problem.
