I ain't kernel developer .. just poor little user,
but i think you might want to look at this stuff below...
I only tried that  little code remotely so  i do NOT know
what's system reaction on console ...
Anyway socket interface goes bye bye after this...
I tried it on 2.4.1-XFS and 2.4.0-XFS (both remotely)
and effects were exactly the same...
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
int main(int argc, const char* argv[])
{
	int retval;
	int sockets[2];
	char buf[1];
	retval = socketpair(PF_UNIX, SOCK_DGRAM, 0, sockets);
	if (retval != 0)
	{
		perror("socketpair");
		exit(1);
	}
	shutdown(sockets[0], SHUT_RDWR);
	read(sockets[0], buf, 1);
}
