With the latest 2.5-bk (and module-init-tools), my logs
are polluted with lines like:
	FATAL: Error running install command for block_major_2
triggered with
	# cat /dev/fd0
where the corresponding line in modprobe.conf is:
	install block-major-2 /bin/true
The problem is reproductible with any 'install' command in
modprobe.conf.
Looking at modprobe source, it fails on the system() call. The
fork()/exec() part works corectly (/bin/true get executed),
but wait4() fails with -ECHILD.
Running 'modprobe block-major-2' from the console works as 
expected.
I believe this is once again related to the exec_usermodehelper()
routines...
Stelian.
