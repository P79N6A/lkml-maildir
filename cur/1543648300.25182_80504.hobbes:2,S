My experience is that specified minimum number of events (min_nr) of
io_getevents is not quite working yet in kernel 2.4.19.
I haven't  started to exercise this in 2.5.42, but if it is working,
logically  it will help the performance indeed.

I presume f_op->aio_readv could point to __generic_file_aio_read for most
filesystems.
Would f_op->aio_writev need a new wrapper function for 2.5.42 ?
f_op->aio_write eventually calls generic_file_write which uses a different
inode
from generic_file_writev. So f_op->aio_writev might need to point to a
function
like generic_file_writev but using the same inode as generic_file_write.

It would be interesting to see the performance boost when <iov length>
events
are retrieved at once, using the min_nr parameter of io_getevents.
