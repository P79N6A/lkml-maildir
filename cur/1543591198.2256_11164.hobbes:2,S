Subject: NTFS with Win2k - Write Support broken?

Hallo,
I have a linux system with kernel 2.4.4-ac9 and a win2k partition with
ntfs. Since because of the new ntfs version rw support is disabled, I
wondered how much rw support is broken, why and if I could try at least.
Or maybe some help is appreciated?
Thanks a lot,
Axel Siebenwirth
