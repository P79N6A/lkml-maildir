It was submitted, but has several problems:
  * wasn't done as small pieces; too much whole sale replacement
  * ignored all the bugfixes and work that went into the mainline kernel
  * merges support for two kinds of hardware in one driver
Also, it increases the amount of vendor ugly code; the sk98lin driver
would probably not be accepted today.
While developing the skge and sky2 driver I discovered more problems and
those got fixed in the mainline sk98lin driver. The vendor version has
issues like:
  * does NAPI but has interrupts disabled
  * has a watchdog routine to mask off all the bugs they never managed
    to fix.
  * sets PCI-express parameters to benchmark values that cause
    random hangs and data corruption
That is why I wouldn't recommend the vendor version for any production
systems.
