Sorry I toght the commands wabout would be enought:
As root they are listable and read and writeable (for examples via ls -l,
cat /dev/dsp > ~/my-speach.snd or cat ~/my-speach.snd > /dev/dsp), ussing

This is good. The permissions of the files are correct (everyone can use
sound), but I can (as you see in the command's output) neither access nor
read/write them as normal user - but all this works as root.

Yes. All this is possible as root but not using anothe UID.

I use the devfsd.conf to configure the permission when a device registers.

The device-nodes seems to be all there they work as root, but not as normal
user. But it seems to be a ALSA issue, because only the ALSA nodes have this
strange behaviour ... ?
