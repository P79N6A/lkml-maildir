If it's PCI, it's inheirently PnP, but not what you are thinking. The PCI
spec says that the BIOS assignes IRQ and such to the PCI slots, and hence
the PCI cards. Same for the IO address space.
The PnP you are thinking of, that sometimes needs the PnP tools, is an ISA
only standard, that requires either the BIOS or some OS tools to init.
Don't forget the package name is 'isapnp' after all.
