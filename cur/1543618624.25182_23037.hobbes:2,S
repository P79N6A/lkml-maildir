Hola,
I need to create module to perform atomic transactions through the PCI bus 
between the processor and an IDE hard disk. The PCI bus specifications 2.2 
point to the #LOCK signal to perform such a transaction. Is possible to 
assert the #LOCK signal of the PCI bus using the Linux Kernel? How? I didnt 
see any pointers in include/pci.h or anywhere in the source code.
I will truly appreciate any help/pointers,
Jesus
