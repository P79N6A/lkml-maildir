OK, but this is only for the case when the things aren't memlocked anyway,
which in Oracle's case is never. Seems like we're thrashing a lot of time
and effort over sys_remap_file_pages considering it's never actually
desirable to scan the chains for pageout anyway.
And does anyone *really* start off with a linear vma and them convert
it to a linear one after using it? Can't we just fail that call? Would
result in orders of magnitude of reduction in complexity if we could
just narrow the scope of this beastie a bit.
If you have a *non-memlocked* VMA that you've *previously used* as linear,
then the sys_remap_file_pages stuff would fail with an error code. Is 
that too painful? Maybe you can't "un-memlock" a non-linear VMA once
it's memlocked either. I'm quite possibly missing something but if someone
could point out what that is ... ?

Well, it's an order of magnitude less expensive than mem_map still.
No, not perfect, but the world's a compromise ;-) And we don't need
this at all for memlocked ones.

Right, but they seem to be mostly singletons (non-shared), so the 
pte_direct stuff takes care of those mostly anyway. Would be nice eventually,
but I thinking taking one step at a time is maybe helpful ;-)
