OK, I've not actually looked at devfs yet, but: would it be possible to come
up with a set of mods to the current device drivers that could then be used
by devfs *or* any other future solution to /dev-related problems? And that
still worked with a traditional /dev without significant overhead or impact?
The device driver changes could then go into the mainstream kernel, and the
various /dev options could be distributed separately while they are evaluated.
Whatever "wins" (i.e. persuades Linus) could then go in to his tree.
