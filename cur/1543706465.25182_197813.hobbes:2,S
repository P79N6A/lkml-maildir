Ugh, yeah, I thought about this. However my understand was that
since hlist_null is statically allocated variable, its address
will be a known constant at a link time (whether it's a static
link or dynamic/run-time link - btw, excuse my lack of proper
terminology here). So comparing something to &null would be
equivalent to comparing to the constant and not require an
extra register.
