Nick, Even if it is not painful, can we skip balance-on-exec if
balance-on-fork is set. There is no need for double balance, right?
Especially with the optimization you are trying to do with this patch,
balance-on-exec may lead to wrong decision making this optimization
not work as expected.
or perhaps do balance-on-fork based on clone_flags..
