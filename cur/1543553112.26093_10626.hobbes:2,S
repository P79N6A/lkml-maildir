When I'm following this thread, you guys seem to forget the _basics_:
The Linux networking stack sucks!
Everybody tries to work around the networking stack. We just recently
developped a rpc protocol which makes 180MBytes/second (over a Quadrics
Network) because the linux network layer was way too slow. At speeds
above 100MBytes/s, copies start to hurt.
Why not solve the problem at the source and completely redesign the
network stack? Get rid of the old sk_buff & co! Rip the whole network
layer out! Redesign it and give the user a possibility of Zero-Copy
networking!
