It could disable us to make such a conversion step-by-step I think.
Of course it would be better to just extend ENTRY/END (since already
there) and we could even restrict it to X86 only at the beginning
but even then we have to check all ENTRY/END that they are used properly
(ie like a procedure markers having @function attribute). Not sure
what would be better. And btw ENDPROC is more descriptive then plain END :)
