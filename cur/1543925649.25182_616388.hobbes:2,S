A new release of the Linux kernel has more than half a million lines of 
code changed. If you do any estimates based on how many lines of changed 
code equal one newly introduced bug you see the problem...
And the difference between an upstream kernel and a distribution kernel 
are 3-6 months of testing and bugfixing.

Geeks like you and me want the latest software
(I'm using Debian unstable/testing).
But most users want a Linux installation that simply works - and this 
includes all software on the system at all times.
