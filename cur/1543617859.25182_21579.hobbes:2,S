And never will.  Who loads the module - root.  Who maintains the list
of signatures - root.  Who controls the code that verifies the
signature - root.
Your task Jim, should you choose to accept it, is to make the kernel
distinguish between a good use of root and a malicious use by some who
has broken in and got root privileges.  When you can do that, then we
can add signed modules.
