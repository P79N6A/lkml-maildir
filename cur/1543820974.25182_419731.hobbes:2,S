The  modules_install  target uses O= for its _input_ files (that is,
for the readily compiled modules) and outputs to
$(INSTALL_MOD_PATH)/lib/modules/$VERSION/ .  So you may want to set
$(INSTALL_MOD_PATH) in the same way as you've set V= or O= before.
If you're trying to prepare something to be copied over to a target
system, the tar-pkg, targz-pkg and tarbz2-pkg targets may be exactly
what you're searching for.

It's maybe a bit misleading, but `modules_install' isn't a compilation
run, it's an installation run. O= was ment to hold all
compiled/generated objects, but to have a working installation, you
need to break out of that (or have INSTALL_MOD_PATH set.)
