That would need more memory again.
Better just write less bloated code. Perhaps mandatory bloatometer
runs during -rc*s for kernels with minimal config with public code pig shame lists
similar to the regression lists are useful. Anyone volunteering?
I suspect there is also much more low hanging fruit of this around.
I don't think eliminating cpuid is a step forward though; that's
just madness.
I killed about 20k in a i386 defconfig kernel in my upcomming patchkit
(and add some other code instead, but not much) so I'm coming out well currently.
