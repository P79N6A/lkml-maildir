Actually, I use sysrq as if it's just another feature.  It should (I
think it does. . . not sure) only work on the console directly, for
security reasons; but it's great when things like X misbehave, or when
I've damaged something and the system doesn't want to shut down.  AS-E
AS-I AS-U AS-S AS-O.  :)  I actually tried making an N sysrq, for
"semi-Normal shutdown."  It would send TERM, wait 5S, send KILL, wait
5S, unmount, sync, reboot.
Just thought it might be interesting to point out that magic-sysrq can
be a helpful feature for someone not hacking the kernel.
