I think: if you are going to hack the hpfs code and coding style patches 
will improve your experience, apply them and push them into mainstream 
kernel. Otherwise don't --- they wouldn't help anybody and they would make 
patch merging between 2.0, 2.2, 2.4 and 2.6 version of this driver (yes 
--- I keep all these synchronised) harder.
