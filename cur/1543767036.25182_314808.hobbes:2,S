It's all very well for platforms that have efficient atomic operations.
However, on parisc we have no such luxury (the processor has no atomic
operations, so we have to fiddle them in the kernel using locks), so it
looks like you're making our semaphore operations less efficient.
Could you come up with a less monolithic way to share this so that we
can still do a spinlock semaphore implementation instead of an atomic op
based one?
Thanks,
James
