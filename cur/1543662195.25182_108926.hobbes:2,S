The reason I harp on pipes is that I remember something like that breaking 
real programs in the past, which is a lot more important.
(Thinking about it, it can't have been pipe reading, it must have been
writing. Reading a pipe always returns partial results early if it is
successful.  Writing doesn't. Trivial test-case appended, see what happens
when you ^Z it.  And realize that more programs care about this than about
timed semaphore operations).

And I have multiple times said that as far as Linux is concerned, ^Z is, 
has always been, and certainly for the 2.6.x timeframe _will_ be a signal 
that the kernel considers "caught".
Another way of saying it: just leave the system calls alone. If they
aren't restartable, they have to return -EINTR. And if you think that
disagrees with POSIX, and if RH really wants certification, then you
should advice RH to document the difference as just that - a difference.  
And push it through as such.
Anyway, try out the following test-program in an xterm. Resize the xterm 
and see what happens. Press ^Z and see what happens. I'm saying that the 
^Z behaviour is something Linux always has done (and as such not something 
you should worry about overmuch), while the SIGWINCH behaviour is new with 
the new signal handling code and _is_ worrysome, since that can break old 
programs (but I think your patch fixes it, so I'm not worried).
To recap:
 - common functions are a lot more important than uncommon ones (which is 
   why the pipe thing is interesting)
 - old behaviour is a lot more important than POSIX (existing binaries 
   have all been tested with old behaviour).
Considering that the SIGCHLD:SIG_IGN change to child reaping apparently 
broke at least one existing program, I hope you can see my point. At some 
point it just doesn't _matter_ what POSIX says.
