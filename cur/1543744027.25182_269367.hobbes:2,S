We have actually set the kernel threads to priority SCHED_RR 50, and
most user-space threads to SCHED_RR priority 50. Some critical
user-space threads are above priority 50.
Won't this allow the kernel and user space threads to co-operate nicely
all the time?
What is it specifically that will make kernel SCHED_RR threads cause
non-real-time operation? If it's just a bunch of corner cases or odd
conditions, we may be in an environment we can control so that doesn't
happen...
I guess we could have most threads stay at SCHED_NORMAL, and just make
the few critical threads SCHED_RR, but I'm getting a lot of push-back on
this, since it makes our thread API a lot more complex.
