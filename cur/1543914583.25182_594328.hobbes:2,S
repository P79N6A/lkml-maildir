Sam, in a way you actually prove my point. Thanks. :)
The primary thing you remember here from the announcements is the cleanup 
and tuning part, during which he picked up some small parts from my patch.
That's what I was afraid of, most people won't realize what was added in 
this process and even if they notice it, Ingo describes it somewhat 
"similiar", but actually "different". That part is pretty important to me, 
but Ingo treats it more as a minor matter.
bye, Roman
