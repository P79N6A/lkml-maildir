Could you repost it please ?
I guess a seqlock could avoid some cache line bouncing on mmap_sem for some 
kind of operations. I wonder if it could speed up do_page_fault() ???

It seems nobody but you and me cared.
BTW I am surprised of Ulrich bugging linux on MADV_KERNEL_CAN_DROP, while 
glibc still does :
FILE *F = fopen("/etc/passwd", "r");
fget(line, sizeof(line), F);
fclose(F);
->
open("/etc/passwd", O_RDONLY)           = 3
fstat(3, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=1505, ...}) = 0
mmap(NULL, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) = 
0x2b67097f0000
read(3, "root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash\n"..., 4096) = 1505
close(3)                                = 0
munmap(0x2b67097f0000, 4096)            = 0
using mmap()/munmap() to allocate one 4096 bytes area is certainly overkill. 
mmap_sem is apparently the thing we must hit forever.
Maybe nobody but me still uses fopen()/fclose() after all ?
