doh, and thanks for the info.

Well the reason I ask....
static inline void writeb(unsigned char b, volatile void __iomem *addr)
{
         *(volatile unsigned char __force *) addr = b;
}
static inline void writew(unsigned short b, volatile void __iomem *addr)
{
         *(volatile unsigned short __force *) addr = b;
}
static inline void writel(unsigned int b, volatile void __iomem *addr)
{
         *(volatile unsigned int __force *) addr = b;
}

That's what I'm asking.
Thanks,
