Oops... I have a test compile going that changed those to 
check_mem_region.  And while I didn't change the i2c stuff, which 
still reports the error, advansys.o built w/o error this time.
Ok, so I can change that to !request_region, but I have NDI when to go 
about releasing it, if ever, for a kernel driver thats either there, 
and the hardware is used, or not because the hardware isn't present.  
It seems to me that if its allocated to this driver, and capable of 
being re-used at anytime, then the allocation should, once made, 
stand.  Or is my view of the world skewed and it should be done at 
the bottom of whatever conditional is involved?  Inquiring minds want 
to know.  I guess it all depends on what happens if the call is 
repeated.  Will it assign a new buffer each time?, thereby causeing a 
memory leak, or will it find its been done once and return success 
anyway?
Thanks very much for the quick response.
