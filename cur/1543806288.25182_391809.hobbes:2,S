We can't just remove this list_del, note __ptrace_link() above.
So if we remove list_add from switch_exec_pids() (like you did
in your patch) we should also place list_add before ptrace_link()
in de_thread(), otherwise I beleive it is a bug.
I agree, we should cleanup this. I just noticed that I forgot
to add you on CC: list while sending this patch:
	http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=113862839924746
Btw, I don't understand why __ptrace_link() use REMOVE_LINKS/SET_LINKS
instead of remove_parent/add_parent.
Oleg.
