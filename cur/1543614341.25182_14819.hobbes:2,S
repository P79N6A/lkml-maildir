Thanks Vojtech and Mark, this is good to know and gives

The funny thing still is that i get this error regardless
of whether i overclock, underclock, or leave as is using
kernel 2.5.2-pre1, when i start X:
Inconsistency detected by ld.so: dynamic-link.h: 62: elf_get_dynamic_info: Assertion `! "bad dynamic tag"' failed!
X eventually starts, minus the Sawfish window manager.
Everything's fine from kernel version 2.5.1 down.  If it
is indeed disk corruption of some kind, i guess i better 
run an older kernel and fsck.
