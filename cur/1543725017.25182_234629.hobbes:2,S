Yes, I see that this area (which used to be empty_zero_page)
is independent since 2.6.5.
So, maybe your patch is correct.
[Still, the patch brings knowledge about boot_params that earlier was
concentrated in head.S, setup.c, setup.h to elsewhere in the kernel. Ach.]
The doc file is still called zero-page.txt. One might add
0x228   4 bytes         command line buffer
and possibly rename it.
