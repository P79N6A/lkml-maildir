It will still drop _all_ VM mappings from memory if you left "cp /dev/zero
." in background for say 2 hours. This in turn mean that during streming
I/O you'll have _much_ more than the current swapin/swapout troubles.
If I download a dozen of CD images with a gigabit ethernet I don't want
_anything_ to be unmapped from main RAM, and yes I may have 8giga of RAM
so I don't want to use O_DIRECT for the downloads.
