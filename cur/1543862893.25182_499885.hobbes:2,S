i'm assuming you mean "Documentation/feature-removal-schedule.txt".
that would *seem* to make sense, after only a few seconds of thought.
once config options are tagged with either DEPRECATED or OBSOLETE,
surely it wouldn't be hard to be able to pull out a list of those from
the source tree, based on their Kconfig dependencies.
but, again, that's getting ahead of ourselves.  certainly, it's
something that *could* be done at some point, but not knowing exactly
how one would do that doesn't stop anyone from adding those two config
settings *now*, just to get the process rolling.
let's not over-analyze this too much.

p.s.  it might be worth perusing the feature removal file, to see what
features are still listed there even though they were scheduled to be
removed some time ago.  just a thought.
