See sources. You neek to lock_kernel() for a great amount of instructions
like any nother kernel function.
There are kernel locks all around in sources.
So don't come here and talk about locking ineffiency.
Because scarse scalability of Linux on multiprocessor
is a reality nobody can hide.
With or without my primitives.

Even with my API. Data doesn't disapper magically
from the sender logical address space.
Also, with minor changes, you can use my primitives
to implement a one-copy channel, if shared memory among processes
sounds to you as a blasfemy.
Always better than two-fase-copying current pipe implementation.

Sincerely, I COMPLETELY DON'T CARE.
If it is used or not, it's completely irrilevant, when valueing performance.
Good bye.
