Yeep. Not quite that drastically but basically it's the
upper layer going down the driver and up again.
Anyway. This all will be gone soon, since I have just already
made the distinction between ata_queue and atapi_queue... and
well things turn out nicely at least in the lieu of code.
The synchronization between them can be done by deploying
precisely the same blk_queue_plug and blk_queue_unplug games
already played in tcq.c. And it's very likely that
we will end up unwinding the REQ_DRIVE_CMD and REQ_DRIVE_ACB
cases by just providing two different request handlers...
And thus finally unwinding ATA ver. ATAPI handling entierly,
which should indeed simplyfy things quite a lot...
