Hi,
I received the following errors while trying out 2.4.2. 
After going back to 2.2.19prexx and doing an fsck, it works
fine.  They came up after about six hours or so of running
time.
EXT2-fs warning (device md(9,5)): ext2_unlink: Deleting nonexistent file (7635227), 0
EXT2-fs error (device md(9,5)): ext2_free_blocks: Freeing blocks not in datazone - block = 982921785, count = 1
EXT2-fs error (device md(9,5)): ext2_free_blocks: Freeing blocks not in datazone - block = 982921785, count = 1
EXT2-fs error (device md(9,5)): ext2_free_blocks: Freeing blocks in system zones - Block = 65536, count = 1
EXT2-fs error (device md(9,5)): ext2_free_blocks: Freeing blocks in system zones - Block = 8, count = 1
EXT2-fs warning (device md(9,5)): ext2_unlink: Deleting nonexistent file (7635226), 0
EXT2-fs error (device md(9,5)): ext2_free_blocks: Freeing blocks not in datazone - block = 982921785, count = 1
EXT2-fs error (device md(9,5)): ext2_free_blocks: Freeing blocks not in datazone - block = 982921785, count = 1

EXT2-fs error (device md(9,5)): ext2_free_blocks: bit already cleared for block 65536
EXT2-fs error (device md(9,5)): ext2_free_blocks: Freeing blocks in system zones - Block = 8, count = 1
EXT2-fs error (device md(9,5)): ext2_free_blocks: bit already cleared for block 8
init_special_inode: bogus imode (1011)
init_special_inode: bogus imode (1012)
init_special_inode: bogus imode (1013)
init_special_inode: bogus imode (1026)
I'm not sure if those init_special_inode errors are
related.  /dev/md5 is an md linear array composed of two
IDE hard disks on an HPT370 IDE controler.  Both Maxtor
disks.  DMA was enabled on both disks when the errors
occurred.
Regards,
Shane
