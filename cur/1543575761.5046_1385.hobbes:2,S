Adding persistent module data to modutils meant that insmod had to be a
lot more picky about MODULE_PARM() entries.  There were a few modules
that had invalid MODULE_PARM() entries, nobody had spotted them
previously because nobody used those options.  Since these are bugs in
the modules and only a few modules are affected (less than 5 reported),
the fix is to correct the modules that have coding errors.
