That's not entirely acceptable. The reason this shows up is if an
automatic build is being done, and the config files are not up-to-date,
the prefered action is a build failure, not selecting defaults. The
reason for my fix was that instead of filling up diskspace with a
logfile of kconf's infinite loop, we just exit with an error.
Currently, this is the only way to ensure that these issues don't go
unnoticed.
