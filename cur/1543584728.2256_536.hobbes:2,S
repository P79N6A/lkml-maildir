Its external on the 'speedstep' mostly. Take a look at what little docs
there are and you can see the mobile PIII chipset does it

If tpctl can do it and we know how it does it then that may be sufficient since
the kernel init code can use DMI to find the 600E, tpctl copied code to go
to high speed, bogomip it and then drop back.
