Hmm, that's news to me.  Maybe that's a newer patch.  I haven't been 
reading the list much for the last month or so...
Nick had a patch that was supposed to help 2.6 with low memory 
situations to bring it on a par with 2.4 in that respect.  ISTR "active 
recycling" being mentioned about it...
I also did a
find / -xdev -type f -exec cat "{}" \; > /dev/null 2>&1
with no swap and my page cache didn't get any bigger and slab didn't 
shrink. :(
Is there anything in 2.6.3 in respect to IDE, MD Raid{1,5}, knfsd, or 
athlons I should worry about in upgrading from 2.6.1?
Thanks,
Mike
