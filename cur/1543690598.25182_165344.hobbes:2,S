Subject: [PATCH] 2.4.22 precedes 0.9.9 in module-init-tools of course

I think newbies still need a more emphatic hint, such as:

 encountered a bug!  If you're unsure what version you're currently
 running, the suggested command should tell you.
 
+Except also upgrade your module-init-tools if your depmod -V gives

 Again, keep in mind that this list assumes you are already
 functionally running a Linux 2.4 kernel.  Also, not all tools are
 necessary on all systems; obviously, if you don't have any PCMCIA (PC
Sure, 2.6.0-test5 helps some with:
$ cp /etc/redhat-release /dev/null
$ time sudo make install modules_install
...
Warning: you may need to install module-init-tools

But I believe that hint is insufficient, because I know back when I was
mystified, that url was unreachable.
I admit Google did eventually direct me to the seemingly more available
alternate:

P.S. A fresh, but more complete, quote of what once mystified me is:
$ uname -r
2.4.20-6smp
$ /sbin/depmod -V
depmod version 2.4.22
depmod: Can't open /lib/modules/2.4.20-6smp/modules.dep for writing
$ sudo /sbin/depmod -V
depmod version 2.4.22
$
...
$ uname -r
2.6.0-test5
$ sudo /sbin/modprobe sr_mod
modprobe: QM_MODULES: Function not implemented
modprobe: QM_MODULES: Function not implemented
modprobe: Can't locate module sr_mod
$
Since being demystified, I've adopted a procedure I discovered only by
combining in order from module-init-tools all of man depmod, May
./README, Feb ./FAQ, Nov ./INSTALL:
cp /sbin/lsmod /dev/null
./configure --prefix=/
make
./depmod -V
sudo make moveold
sudo make install
sudo ./generate-modprobe.conf /etc/modprobe.conf
sudo vi /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit +/USEMODULES=
I see I should also submit a patch elsewhere for the module-init-tools
README and FAQ.  I believe the INSTALL is incorrect by design (by being
generic).
