I had a rule: we always do the "lock_buffer()" and "b_count increment"
together with setting "b_end_io = end_buffer_io_async". Why? Because that
way we pair up the actions, and I could easily verify that every single
user of "end_buffer_io_async" will increment the count (that is
decremented in "end_buffer_io_async").
We never used to have any rules in this area, and it was sometimes hard to
match up the actions with each other.

Agreed.

I already sent him mail about it for the same reason.

fsync() has _always_ ignored mmap'ed stuff. 
If you want to get your mappings synchronized, you absolutely positively
have to call "msync()".
