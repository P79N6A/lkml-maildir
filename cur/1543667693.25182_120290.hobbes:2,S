I'll throw a couple big evolutionary simulations on one of my boxes, and 
see how Linux digests it. Lovely thing about stochastic code -- you 
never know what it might do. :)
I could put my wife on Linux. She's a brilliant woman of great talent -- 
and, alas, she is endowed with an incredible ability to wreak 
unintentional destruction on technology. She has accomplished some truly 
remarkable feats of software implosion -- sometimes, without touching 
the keyboard!
Let's put it this way: She got *really* angry at me once, and all of my 
systems (Linboxen included) REBOOTED spontaneously in reaction to her 
outburst!
Now that's what *I* call "stressing" the code!
