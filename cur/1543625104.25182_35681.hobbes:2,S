Are you talking about this patch:
+++ linux.19pre3-ac1/init/do_mounts.c   Thu Mar 14 23:01:31 2002

 done:
        putname(fs_names);
        if (do_devfs)
-               sys_umount(".", 0);
+               sys_umount(".", MNT_DETACH);
 }
 
 #ifdef CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD
I tried that and it didn't fix the problem.
