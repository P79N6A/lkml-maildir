IMO Multiplexing would be preferred, we can't be allocating that many

There isn't a 1:1 relationship between NR_IRQS and NR_VECTORS we really 
shouldn't mix them together. NR_IRQS can be much higher than 256 whilst 
on i386 we're fixed to 256 vectors due to that being the Interrupt 
Descriptor Table capacity. It is still possible to service more interrupt 
lines than 256 on SMP however by making IDTs per 'interrupt servicing 
node'
