Nice catch - thanks.  It was (perhaps) only inefficient until recently, because
cpuset_fork() didn't do any locking - just an atomic cpuset counter increment.
But with the locking overhaul that went into Linus's tree Oct 31, 2005,
cpuset_fork() now takes task_lock(), to guard against cpuset.c attach_task()
invalidating the task->cpuset pointer as cpuset_fork is dereferencing it.
I will look into preparing a patch that moves cpuset_fork() outside the
write_lock_irq().
