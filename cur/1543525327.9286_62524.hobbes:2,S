Correct!

LVM doesn't have this restriction.
If you choose a Physical Extent size of more than 4MB (which is the default
today) at volume group creation time you are able to address multiple
Terabytes directly today.
BTW: LVM command vgcreate(8) tells you about the constraints implied
     by the Physical Extend size and if you don't like them just remove
     your new Volume Group and recreate it with corrected Physical Extent size.
     This is a question of a minute's work.
Nevertheless with IA32 you are still restricted to a maximum of 1 Terabyte
(2 Terabyte if the kernel is unsigned int/long cast clean) per single
block device.
The LVM therefore is able to deal with up to the possible 128 scsi disk
subsystems each of them up to 2 Terabytes in size (the limits implied
by the 8 bit minor number scheme can be worked arround by devfs and will
disapear anyway in the future). You can add some IDE disks as well 8-{)
All these disk subsystems can be configured into a single Volume Group
giving you a "Virtual Disk" of up to 256 Terabyte in size on IA32 today.
Nevertheless, as i mentioned above, a single Logical Volume becausecan only
have a size of up to 2 Terabytes (1 Terabyte garanteed 8), because its just
another block device.
In theory on 64 bit architectures these constraints should not exist at all.
You'll tell us if they still do, right ;-{)))
