Subject: [PATCH] rt2500usb - Don't claim 050d:705{0/a}
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I have a Belkin USB Wireless adapter with ID 050d:705a.
Both rt2500usb.c and rt73usb.c claim that they can drive the device with 
this ID.
When using the distro kernel as well as custom 2.4.24-rc1 both rt73usb and 
rt2500usb get loaded and fight for the register writes and fail. rt2500usb 
is not able to drive my device. So I have to manually rmmod/modprobe or 
delete rt2500usb.ko and depmod every time I get a new kernel.
If only rt73usb is loaded everything works well. To me it 
sounds like rt2500usb should not be driving 050d:705a.
There is another ID 050d:7050 which is also claimed to be handled by both 
rt3500usb and rt73usb. Assuming rt73usb can drive this as well (I have no 
way to be sure as I don't have device with this ID) the following patch 
makes sure only rt73usb claims the 2 devices.
