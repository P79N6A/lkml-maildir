The switch has been delayed. Up to now we just reboot the machine every
48h - the administrator responsible for the machine is on holiday... 
Meanwhile, I noticed, that the latest release candidate has several
changes which could be quite interesting for us:
<andrea@suse.de>
    [PATCH] orphaned pagecache memleak fix
    Chris found that with data journaling a reiserfs pagecache may
    be truncate while still pinned.  The truncation removes the
    page->mapping, but the page is still listed in the VM queues
    because it still has buffers.  Then during the journaling process,
    a buffer is marked dirty and that sets the PG_dirty bitflag as well
    (in mark_buffer_dirty).  After that the page is leaked because it's
    both dirty and without a mapping.
<mason@suse.com>
    [PATCH] reiserfs: make sure data=journal buffers are cleaned on free
    In data=journal mode, when blocks are freed and their buffers
    are dirty, reiserfs can remove them from the transaction without
    cleaning them. These buffers never get cleaned, resulting in an
    unfreeable page.
On the other side we don't want to install a rc1-kernel on a important
system. Up to now we still plan to do the switch to ext3...
If someone would recommend to install a special reiserfs-patch (*not*
the 12mb of patch-2.6.12-rc1) we would consider that, too! So some
feedback from "the big sharks" is still very welcome.
Best regards	Tobias
