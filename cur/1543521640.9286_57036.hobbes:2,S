Cool. Now forkbomb authors have to put timeouts into their
code and wait with detonating the for(;;) loops until they've
reached their max_tasks_per_user limit...
Or rather, this is a clever way to mask the problem. Some
things you probably want on a shell server with (lots of)
untrusted users are:
- fair scheduling (first allocate per user, then divide that
                   cpu time into what the processes want)
- a good beancounting system to avoid out-of-memory DoSes
- good logging to kick evil kiddiez and make sure they don't
  work together to take the system down anyway
I believe that options and patches for the first and third
option already exist, the second will be worked on in the
future because several people have expressed their interest
in it.
cheers,
Rik
