Thanks David, but if you read my original post in full you'll see that I've tried that, and while I can start the write out sooner by lowering /proc/sys/vm/dirty_ratio , it makes no difference to the results that I am getting. I still seem to run out of steam after only 50 seconds where it should take about 3 minutes.
regards, Anthony
