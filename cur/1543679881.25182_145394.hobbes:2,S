That's a change with deeper semantic implications as it's relying on
different information.
The phys_cpu_present_map bits were to divorce its width from NR_CPUS
in a portable way. Shifting to bios_cpu_map[] should only change cpu
wakeup. IO-APIC physid reassignment code still needs a variable-width
map (I suppose you could use integers) of some kind.
