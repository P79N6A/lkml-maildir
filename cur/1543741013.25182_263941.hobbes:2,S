which makes its user base pretty small. 9.3 is where we will probably 
get a lot of users. Probably more bugs will get found by the SuSE QA 
team in the next few weeks though, and that should help us.
The one I am wanting to precede regarding shipping is Lindows where we 
will be the default. Reiser4 is pretty stable now, but if we got into 
the kernel now we'd have a few weeks of bug finding before they ship, 
and I just bet there will be a few bugs found as a result (not frequent 
ones, but....) that several of their users would be happy to not hit. 
The official kernel has the advantage of a far faster test and fix time 
cycle than a distro, and has more sophisticated users. The reason for 
features going into distros first is not technical, and sad.
