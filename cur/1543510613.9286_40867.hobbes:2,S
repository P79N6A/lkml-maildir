I have a new page listing all the recent NT vs. Linux benchmarks
I know of; it's at
  
http://www.kegel.com/nt-linux-benchmarks.html
It includes links to that MS page and one other similar one,
as well as links to the recent (and first?) certified database
benchmark for linux, an SAP benchmark run by Siemens on a
quad CPU machine.
