Adrian,
There are requests to move it out of EMBEDDED because sometimes you
just  don't need input layer at all. Dave Jones mentioned that he
feels silly enabling EMBEDDED on iSeries... I am thinking about
changing it to "EMBEDDED || !X86_PC" to safe-guard the most common
platform from accidenially disabling it.
I am still not convinced whether INPUT=m makes sence, especially if
we make ACPI use input layer... Jan's example about input device with
hot-pluggable keyboard is a bit of a stretch.
