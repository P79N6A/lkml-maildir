// add the next git repo as a tracked remote
git remote add next git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/sfr/linux-next.git
// fetch any objects you don't have
// run this whenever you want to check for more objects
git remote update
// produce a tarball of the tree tagged next-20080220
git archive --format=tar next-20080220 > next-20080220.tar
