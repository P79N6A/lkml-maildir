> What about fsync()?
There were no changes to fsync() between 2.6.5 and 2.6.6. In any case,
Joe's test program did not use fsync() (that was very much the problem).
Any use of either close() or fsync() on the client will cause the
mtime/ctime to be updated on the server, and that change should
immediately propagate back to the client.
Cheers,
  Trond
