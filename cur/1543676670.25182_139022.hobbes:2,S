Sure -- just change the name of the bug to "2.5 tree out of date
with respect to MPC107 platforms" and add a comment saying
where the up to date code is that needs to be merged in.
Then leave it open to reflect the fact that the vger tree
is out of date for these platforms.
Isn't this an example of the eternal struggle between the vger tree and
the trees maintained by the ppc, arm, and SH teams?  I don't
have any idea how far apart the trees are at the moment,
but I use x86, ppc, and SH at work, and would like to
use the same kernel tree for all three, so this is a bit
of a sore point for me.
