Hi,
  I have one small problem with 2.4.0-test11 and exec_usermodehelper.
When vmware modules shutdown (specifically vmnet-netifup), kernel tries
to load some module through call_usermodehelper, but unfortunately
from task which has current->files == NULL.
  So it prints message:
waitpid(19457) failed, -512
  and then it oopses in
for (i = 0; i < current->files->max_fds; i++) {
  if (current->files->fd[i]) close(i);
}
(In log, there is first waitpid, and then oopses from current->files == NULL,
which I do not quite understand).
Should I look into this more deeply, or is correct fix just add
if (current->files) {
  for (i = 0; ..... ) ...
}
into exec_usermodehelper?
                                        Best regards,
                                            Petr Vandrovec
