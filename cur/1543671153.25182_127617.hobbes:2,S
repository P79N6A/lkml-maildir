Hi all 
I had a discussion with somebody watching the whole M$ server launch and mentioned then new systems supports up to a terabyte of ram. 
I've tried looking for a hint at what the max momery support on linux is and cannot find it anywhere.
can somebody here enlighten me on just what the maximum amount of memory linux can deal with ?
