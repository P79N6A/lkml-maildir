Thanks Con,
Results look pretty good. The half-load context switches are
increased - that is probably a result of active balancing.
And speaking of active balancing, it is not yet working across
nodes with the configuration you're on.
To get some idea of our worst case SMT performance (-j8), would
it be possible to do -j8 and -j64 runs with HT turned off?
