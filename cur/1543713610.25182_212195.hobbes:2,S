Depends on what the requirement is. In some cases you
MUST do this - otherwise the tables required for making
the decision would be WAY too large for the kernel.
Some models even require reference to remote hosts
for validation. The current Kerberos authentication
requires this. So do AFS requests.
Other requests can be satisfied by a cached table entry
without waiting.

It only depends on the request. If the entire security
context is local, then this is not required.

LISP code (if compiled machine code) IS small. LISP
VM is not - when you combine it with the lisp code,
the heap management, and garbage collector. And you
can STILL have memory leaks out the wazoo. To prevent
the memory leaks you have to have a mark and sweep GC.
Which still doesn't prevent circular loop leaks. Then
you need a memory pool allocator to relocate all valid
references. The combination is NOT small. BTW, the JVM
suffers from circular loop leaks too, since all it uses
is reference counting (for speed).

No - they mean the VM + garbage collector + error handler +
the lisp pcode.
