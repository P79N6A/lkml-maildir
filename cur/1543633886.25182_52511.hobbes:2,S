	I did not realize that allocation with __GFP_WAIT was guaranteed
to _never_ fail.
	Even so, if __GFP_WAIT never fails, then it can deadlock (for
example, some other device driver has a memory leak).  Under a
scheme like bio_chain (provided that it is changed not to call a
memory allocator that can deadlock), the only way you deadlock is
if there really is deadlock bug in the lower layers that process
the underlying request.
