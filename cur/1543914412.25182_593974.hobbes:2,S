In particular xceive based drivers provide a numerous set
of features which cannot be implemented into the kernel
because the API (both V4L and DVB) are limited.
Since to me it seriously has the impression that the project
especially the core of the project is closed to the outside
world (just how someone stated it out recently
"he licked the butts of others" to get his stuff accepted)

I don't have any binary only software just as all the time before.
I am also allowed to publish firmware for several drivers
(not only the em28xx driver). Although as mentioned earlier
already the current existing driver is not really manageable
due the firmware mess and that driver will change completly
and include templates for several other bridge drivers.
