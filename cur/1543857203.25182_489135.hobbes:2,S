Ok, good to know, since that's what we're doing with ARM drivers
presently. What's the preferred method going forward?
If architectures with coherency problems have to take care of this in
their kmap() implementations, wouldn't commits like [1] below result
in a pessmization for these architectures, since effectively the flush
would happen twice (once by architecture-specific kunmap, and once by
the flush_dcache_page() being added in this commit)?
