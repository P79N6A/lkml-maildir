No, it isn't a problem of dust or grease. It is a problem of a case full 
of devices and bad airflow within it. (There's 6 HDDs, 8 PCI cards, an 
AthlonXP 3200+ with massive Zalman CNPS6000-Cu on top of it and 10 fans 
that are doing all they can running at maximum (with the noise of a 
medium vacuum cleaner ;), trying to cool it all, but it just isn't 
enough.) So I'll try to solve it by a water cooling.
I just didn't connect these sounds with the MB alarm. (Even though I know 
that there is this kind of feature.)
However thanks for the advises anyway,
Martin
