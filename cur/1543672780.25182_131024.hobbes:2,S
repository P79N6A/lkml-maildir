	I agree that documentation would be extremely useful in this
case and that distributing documentation shares a lot of the social
benefits of distributing source code, but the GPL does not require
shipping all forms of documentation, but it does require shipping
source code.  Maybe you think that a future version of the GPL
should require that.  The pros and cons of the discussion would
be interesting, but it is irrelevant to the question of what
version 2 (the version we are discussing) of the GNU General Public
License says.  GPL v2 only requires distribution of "the preferred
form of the work for making modifications to it."  Documentation
of magic numbers is often a separate work, often not even a
machine readable work.
>And one big binary blob is better than the other. Same here.
	"better" is a question for what you think the license
should be, not a question of the meaing of the current license.
The current license does not say "you must do whatever is better."

	Although I've never heard a lawyer tell me anything was
"definitely legal in all countries", I agree with your sentiment.
I am not a lawyer.  Please do not rely on this as legal advice.
