Or something like that, yes. :-)
I was trying to make the point that the weighted load stuff provides 
useful data for implementing nice (in a number of ways e.g. see spa_ebs).
Also, now that the old time slices are gone, a simpler more efficient 
function for mapping RT priority or nice (as appropriate) to 
p->load_weight can be used instead of the current one which uses the 
time slice the task would have been allocated as a basis.  I'd suggest 
the function that the current one replaced.  (Because it was mine :-)).
