I have a (very) wild guess at what maybe have changed with the cmnd->done
patch:
Do you remember the effective loop in scsi_lib:scsi_end_request() where
if bufflen was smaller then original request size, do to truncation
of bufflen by ULD, then the remaining of the request is re-queued again
as a new scsi-command. Well I think that the old system would call
cmnd->done for every iteration, and the new system, since the done is
called by the block-Q, does not see the resubmit of the new command.
I have not followed all code path of the matter, but I know that sr does
alters bufflen in some cases. 
All this is not a bug in itself, but it is a change in behavior that might 
cause the current sr hack to fail.
