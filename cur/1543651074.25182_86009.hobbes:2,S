Now that you mentioned it: Just a few hours ago I popped in a soundcard
into one of my machines:
Nov  1 16:10:20 nicole kernel: solo1: version v0.19 time 11:19:52 Apr 14 2002
Nov  1 16:10:20 nicole kernel: PCI: Found IRQ 10 for device 00:13.0
Nov  1 16:10:20 nicole kernel: IRQ routing conflict for 00:13.0, have irq 3, want irq 10
This is also an Apollo/MVP3 chipset. Other than that the soundcard seems
to work fine. I don't see this with any other card BTW.
