Sure, coax inputs are the best. But there are still problems. Even
expensive coax has higher attenuation at higher frequencies, so the
longer the cable, the more fuzziness you get. Also, there are
differential delay effects between the R, G and B components. You
don't want the pixel components to arrive at different times. So
there's a length limitation there as well.
But even though coax is better, VGA isn't that bad. 15 m gets you
quite a lot of terminals in a web kiosk (or undergrad computer lab).
BTW: I agree that X terminals suck. Even worse are SunRays. Ug!
