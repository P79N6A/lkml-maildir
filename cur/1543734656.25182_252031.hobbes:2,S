Hi There
I have just hooked up my new via mainboard 
(
http://www.viaembedded.com/product/epia_ms_spec.jsp?motherboardId=281
)
and installed the latest linux kernel on the system (2.6.8). 
Unfortiunatly something is misbehaving with the timer/kernel interaction.
A snippet from dmesg:
agpgart: Detected VIA CLE266 chipset
agpgart: Maximum main memory to use for agp memory: 424M
agpgart: AGP aperture is 4M @ 0xe7000000
Losing some ticks... checking if CPU frequency changed.

Losing too many ticks!
TSC cannot be used as a timesource. 
Possible reasons for this are:
  You're running with Speedstep,
  You don't have DMA enabled for your hard disk (see hdparm),
  Incorrect TSC synchronization on an SMP system (see dmesg).
Falling back to a sane timesource now.
Furthermore editors like jed and emacs takes forever to start. A "strace 
emacs /somefile" shows that it hangs in a poll right after gettimeofday.
Any clues to what is wrong and how I go about fixing it?!
