A possible counter example: CONFIG_SCSI.
(RAID_ATTRS is currently a little misplaced).
It's optional for any config symbol to have any code attached to it, 
menuconfig doesn't change anything.

Since I'm the one who _invented_ it, I can tell you you're wrong. :)
This functionality isn't limited to menuconfig symbols. The menu option 
simply changes how the child symbols can be displayed.
