OK, here's another 0.1% for you.  Considering how Linux SMP
doesn't have high CPU affinity, would it be possible to make a
patch such that the additional CPUs remain in deep sleep/HALT
mode until the first CPU hits a high-water mark of say 90% 
utilization?  I've started doing this by hand with the (x)pulse
application.   My goal is to save electricity and cut down on 
excess heat when I'm just browsing the web and not compiling
or seti@home'ing.
