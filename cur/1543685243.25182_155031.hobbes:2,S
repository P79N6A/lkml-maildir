I've had (several) filesystem corruption in a desktop system with (several)
journaled filesystems on several disks. (They seem pretty stable these days,
though)
However I've not had any fs corrution in ext2; ext2 it's (from my experience)
rock stable.
Personally I'd consider twice the really "serious" option for a serious server.
