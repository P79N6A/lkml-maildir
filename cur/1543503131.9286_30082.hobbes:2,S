right - i should have specified that the "readbehind" has negative effects
for random accesses, but are not much of an issue for sequential accesses
of an mmap'd file.
the change to make the kernel read the next cluster during a page fault is
actually very very simple.  in mm/filemap.c filemap_nopage() ::
no_cached_page:
        /*
         * Try to read in an entire cluster at once.
         */
        reada   = offset; 
        reada >>= PAGE_CACHE_SHIFT + page_cluster;
        reada <<= PAGE_CACHE_SHIFT + page_cluster;
        for (i = 1 << (page_cluster+1); i>0; --i,reada += PAGE_CACHE_SIZE)
                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                new_page = try_to_read_ahead(file, reada, new_page);
now, this doesn't do anything special for MAP_SEQUENTIAL mmaps, but it
gives you enough to try testing.  i've found that it helps performance
somewhat on a 128M server with SCSI disks, but hinders performance
significantly on a 64M laptop with an IDE disk (no cache).
aside: many disk drives i've encountered have a track cache in the 35-50K
per-track range.  i'm wondering (aloud) whether using a 32K cluster size
might be a better use of the disk track cache?
anyway, the following might be more interesting, since it preserves
existing sequential readahead behavior while limiting read-behind during
random accesses:
no_cached_page:
        /*
         * Try to read in an entire cluster at once.
         */
        reada   = offset; 
        reada >>= PAGE_CACHE_SHIFT + page_cluster - 2;
                                                 ^^^^
        reada <<= PAGE_CACHE_SHIFT + page_cluster - 2;
                                                 ^^^^
        for (i = 1 << page_cluster; i > 0; --i, reada += PAGE_CACHE_SIZE)
                new_page = try_to_read_ahead(file, reada, new_page);
this snippet aligns cluster page-ins to quarter-cluster boundaries.  this
seems to work a little better than page- or cluster-aligned cluster
read-ins.  i've been testing this with a benchmark suite configured to
take up almost all available memory.  i've found that the number of
page-ins required to run the benchmark the second time (that is, after the
caches are warm) is reduced significantly, which i take to mean that the
number of unnecessary page-ins has been reduced, when compared against the
stock kernel.
one might also note that this "for" loop will happily continue past the
end of file.  this is safe since try_to_read_ahead simply returns if the
request is off the end of the file, but really, this loop should stop as
soon as reada is larger than inode->i_size.  likewise in
generic_file_readahead.
there are several other more significant optimizations that can be made
here.  i can post a patch against late 2.3 if anyone's interested.
