Should there be a check in sys_module_init to check for a 0 lenth name
being specified in struct module? If THIS_MODULE->name=""; is added
within a kernel module, future attempts to load, unload and query a module
will fail. I can't think of any reason why someone should need to ability
to set a 0 length name.
