I see. That makes perfect sense given that the GPL v2 is dated 1991... 
this slipped my filters when I was grokking Dick's comment:

I wasn't actually referring to the explanatory text; rather, clause 9 in 
the section "TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND 
MODIFICATION". I suppose though upon reading clause 9 again the phrase "If 
the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may 
choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation." is 
kind of confusing.
Does the header of the GPL in COPYING ("GNU General Public 
License; Version 2, June 1991") count as the "Program" specifying a 
version number of the license?

Agreed.

If the header of the GPL counts as the "Program's" specification of 
the version number, I suppose you're right. I just don't really understand 
why the language allowing _any_ version of the GPL if the version number 
isn't specified then... when would any project ever publish a version of 
the GPL license that has been modified to remove any mention of a version 
number?

Fair enough. I'm not trying to really argue for or against the kernel 
switching versions... just trying to address some posts I've seen on LKML 
that seem to get the licensing issue _really_ wrong (perhaps I'm now in 
that group.)
