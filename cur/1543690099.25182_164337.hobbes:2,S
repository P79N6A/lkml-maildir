AFAIK NAND flash devices have bad sectors and a bad-block table usually at
the end of the device.  That could be the reason why you can ruin your
device writing beyond the reported capacity.  The formatting tool can reset
this area.  You can try to save the area beyond the reported capacity,
overwrite it &c. as you did with the beginning of the drive.  It's not
really kernel related.  The point, as you pointed out, is that the kernel
should handle this failure better.
