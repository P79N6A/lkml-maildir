Lower bits must be clear right? Looks like the pud was released
and then reused for a 64 byte cache or so. This is likely a freelist 
pointer that slub put there after allocating the page for the 64 byte 
cache. Then we tried to use the pud.

Data overwritten after free or after slab was allocated. So this may be 
the same issue. pud was zapped after it was freed destroying the poison 
of another object in the 64 byte cache.
Hmmm.. Maybe I should put the pad checks before the object checks. 
That way we detect that the whole slab was corrupted and do not flag just 
a single object.
