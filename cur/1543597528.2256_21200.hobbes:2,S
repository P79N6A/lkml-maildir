Daniel, if I was real sure that 64k blocks were the right answer, I would agree with you.  I think
nobody knows what will happen with reiserfs if we go to 64k blocks.  It could be great.  On the
other hand, the average number of bytes memcopied with every small file insertion increases with
node size.  Scalable integers (Xanadu project idea in which the last bit of an integer indicates
whether the integer is longer than the base size by an amount equal to the base size, chain can be
infinitely long, they used a base size of 1 byte, but we could use a base size of 32 bits, and limit
it to 64 bits rather than allowing infinite scaling) seem like more conservative coding.
