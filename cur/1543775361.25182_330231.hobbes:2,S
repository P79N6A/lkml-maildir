update: these tests should perform significantly better on the freshly 
released -50-37 (or later) PREEMPT_RT kernels. (fork, execve, mmap [*] 
was improved in -50-36, the others in -50-37)

[*] the extent of the above fork/execve/mmap costs is still unexplained, 
    unless the test was run with HIGHMEM64 and HIGHPTE enabled.
