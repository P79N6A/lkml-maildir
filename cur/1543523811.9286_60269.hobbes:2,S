Hi,
Got lots of these:
kmem_cache_alloc called from non-running (1) task from
c014d5e8!
then one of these:
kmem_cache_alloc called from non-running (2) task from
c014d5e8!
c014d5e8 is in alloc_skb.
ppp generates a lot of them, but not all. With ppp they seem
to be arriving in bursts of five at intervals of maybe 1 to
5 min. Those intervals are likely to reflect my activity. I
also got a few during startup or login.
net/core/skbuff.c says __GFP_WAIT  is clear if
in_interrupt(), but passes all other flags direct to
kmem_cache_alloc. I'm not seeing the printf(KERN_ERR ...)
for sleeping in interrupt from there.
Traces to follow, unless this rings a bell for someone.
Tom
