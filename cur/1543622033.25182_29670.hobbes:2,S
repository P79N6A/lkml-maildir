No.

No.  However, the reader then doesn't work either.
No device entries get created for it (I'm using devfs).
It's a multiformat reader (CF/SM/MMC) so there will be a cluster of
entries when it is working correctly.
Note that the kernel itself doesn't lock, just the module.
That is, the module never completes initialisation and sits there forever.
When it was being loaded by script at boot, I had to use Alt-Sys-K to kill
the process trying to load the module in order to log in.
I have tried upgrading just the usb-storage module from 2.4.17 to 2.4.18
and (unfortunately) it still works.. the cause of the problem is elsewhere.
Any ideas?  Thanks.
