Sorry for reiterating this, but in certain cases, yes, the context
switch to the debugger just to have it ignore the SIGCHLD for that
signal is pointless.

That is under user control of the person using the debugger. What I was
talking about is control in the debuggee process/developer to say that I
would like to spare the unnecessary overhead of notifying the debugger
that a specific signal is being delivered to me. 
By the time GDB decides to ignore the SIGCHLD, you've already incurred
the overhead of notifying GDB and context switching into it. Then GDB,
in userspace, has to waitpid(), look at WIFSTOPPED(status),
WSTOPSIG(status) and then decide to do nothing and ptrace(PTRACE_CONT)
if the signal was one of the ignored signals. Lots of unnecessary
overhead in this case.
It is obvious to me that you and I are going to continue disagreeing
about this and arguing endlessly about this capability, so I would like
to in all modesty solicit other folks opinion about this capability
too...
Thanks
