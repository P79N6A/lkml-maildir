Hi,
this patch is to avoid the cooking of monitors from inside the
framebuffer subsystem. Normally this would be made by
fbmon_valid_timings function, but actually this function does nothing.
So i start writing a new implementation that will make some checks, note
that is not the full answer because it requires to user use another data
structures normally don't used, but for now it checks the basic stuff.
bye
