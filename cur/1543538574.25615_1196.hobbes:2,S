ext2 superblock will be co-located in the same buffer cache object of the
boot sector if blocksize of ext2 is >1k. That's not a problem with ext2 as
far as bootloader writes to the same blockdevice that the fs is using
(since raw device will write inside the fs superblock cache with ext2). It
become a problem if ext2 is >1k and grub writes to /dev/hda at offset
512bytes instead of /dev/hda1 at offset zero. I guess most other fs are
caching the superblock using the buffer cache. (also this
metadata-superblock/bootsector stuff is not changed in any way between
2.2.x and 2.4.x).
