inode sorting probably a good guess for a number of filesystems, you
can map the blocks used to do better still (somewhat fs specific)
you can do better still if you multiple stats in parallel (up to a
point) and let the elevator sort things out

sort + concurrent stats would help here i think
i'm not sure i like the idea of ls using lots of threads though :)
