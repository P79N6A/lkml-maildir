Can we think of a better name?  I mean, all it does is throw away a list of
pages.  The caller doesn't _have_ to be using it within the context of
read_cache_pages().  put_pages()?  put_pages_list()?
And if we do make this a more generic thing, it'd be better off living in
mm/swap.c, which is really mm/mm-library-stuff.c nowadays.

"/**" introduces a kerneldoc comment, but that isn't a kerneldoc comment.
It would be best to turn it into a kerneldoc comment.
