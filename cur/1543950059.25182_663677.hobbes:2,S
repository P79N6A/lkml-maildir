The configuration file is important, since it allows us two levels of control.
At one level the system administrator and at the other level applications. Each
application can maintain it's own hierarchy across reboots.
We thought of a daemon, but there were several overheads and disadvantages. For
one, we needed an IPC mechanism to communicate every client request to the
daemon, the client being the application. The daemon also becomes the single
point of failure for all applications. Moreover, we want to provide the ability
to programmatically update the configuration. A daemon, if desired can be built
on top of the library we propose.

I agree that cgroups is flexible, but why do you think abstracting common tasks
amongst applications will be hard to manage and work with? We want to provide
API that will allow us to fill in parameters and say -- go create this group or
delete this group.

We don't assume that there cannot be two different resource managers per node.
We don't enforce any policy, we just allow for easy creation and manipulation of
control groups hierarchially.

Could you please elaborate, why is it probably easier?
