There is already "memtest86" which does this (well, it uses the kernel's
boot stuff, I think), and then tests as much as it can.  This is probably
better than running it over top of the kernel.  If not, I guess this
would be a good idea. :)
Also, for a machine that is assumed to have a hardware problem, I
wouldn't trust memtest.c's output simply if it doesn't print a failure in
a few hours...other testers actually have some knowledge of the hardware
they're running on built in to them, and so they theoretically should do
a better job than mine. *shrug* :) Although, in Miquel van Smoorenburg's
case, he had run a DOS memory tester for 48 hours before which didn't
turn up anything, so maybe it is worth it...
