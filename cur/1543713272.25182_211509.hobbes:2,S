I have a Soyo P4 motherboard with built in Intel ICH5, Sil, and I have
"IDE + SATA" enabled in the bios, presumably meaning the ICH5 is in
combined mode.  I usually boot with my rootfs on a ordinary IDE drive
(pata on ICH5 ide0), a cdrom (pata on ICH5 ide1) and a sata drive (sata1
on ICH5), which has all been working nicely.  Many thanks.  :-)  Here is
what I usually see from the ICH5:

Yesterday while doing some testing, I made a CD with the same kernel on
it as shown above, i.e. latest 2.4.26-rc1 + the current
2.4.26-rc1-libata3 patch.  I then unplugged the power connector to my
usual rootfs drive (the WDC WD2000JB on ide0) to make sure I wouldn't
screw it up ;-).  
Booting from CD (the SONY on ide1) with only the Maxtor 6Y200M0 (on the
ICH5 sata1), the libata driver wedged solid on bootup.  After printing
    ata1: SATA max UDMA/133 cmd 0xC000 ctl 0xC402 bmdma 0xD000 irq 18
    ata2: SATA max UDMA/133 cmd 0xC800 ctl 0xCC02 bmdma 0xD008 irq 18
the box was dead dead dead.  I can't test this setup with the bios set
to SATA only, since I don't own any SATA cdrom drives.  Simply plugging
the WDC WD2000JB on ide0 back in allowed the system to boot normally.
As nearly as I can tell, one has to have a pata drive installed or the
ata_piix driver will wedge solid.
