Even without git, you can use the kernel.org gitweb install:
	
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=e9ca75b53
(where the "h=...." is the magic part - pick any commit SHA1 you want, 
including short-hand ones like the one I gave).
With git, you just do
	git show e9ca75b53
to see a particular named commit.

Ok, I don't think I have anything like that. The one I pointed to is the 
one by Gerald Britton, acked by you ..
But I now realize that that commit was already in -rc2. In fact, it's just 
before the -rc2 release. So while it claims to fix one oops on shutdown, 
it may be the _cause_ of the oops on mudule unload.
