FWIW, I have a few servers and my workstation running Reiser4 and
CONFIG_4KSTACKS=y for several months now, and haven't encountered
problems yet. One server also runs Reiser4 on top op lvm2, and another
Reiser4 on top of sw raid1.
I know -mm + Reiser4 + 4kstacks is bleeding edge in more than one way,
but I like that for my workstations and the servers are
test/non-critical.
All systems do have real-life load though. I'd be happy to provide data
from these systems. Just mail me the commands.
