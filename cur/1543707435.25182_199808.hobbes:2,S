Hello,
I am trying to add a test module to the kernel image (2.4.20).
I wrote a simple module, named test.c; I do succeed to build it as a module,
perform insmod and rmmod twith it, etc.
Now I want it to be a part of the kernel Image.
The kernel itself does pass full build successfully without this change.
I had put test.c under drivers/char;
I had added it in the makefile under drivers/char
in the follwoing way
obj-$(CONFIG_TEST) += test.o
In config.in under drivers/char I had put :
   tristate 'test' CONFIG_TEST
I had run make menuconfig and selceted this character device (test) with *.
Now when I try to compile it I have an error  about export_symbol.
Since this module that have a call to the EXPORT_SYMBOL
macro, I had tried to add it to the list of export-objs in that Makefile 
(under /drivers/char)
but Now , when running make , I have the follwoing error:
rivers/char/char.o(__ksymtab+0x110): undefined reference to `local symbols 
in discarded section .text.exit'
make: *** [vmlinux] Error 1
any idea which can help will be appreciated.
regards,
sting
