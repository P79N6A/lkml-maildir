Which leads me to the question: which ATA standard brought up the
mandatory FLUSH CACHE command? I saw it's in the ATA 6 draft. How about
standards used in drives that are sold today? ATA 4, ATA 5? Do they have
the FLUSH CACHE command listed, possibly as mandatory? That might be
rather useful to use after in a "synchronous" write.
