How can "painfully slow and non-portable" be better?  You mean faster?
Doesn't change the fact that I doubt he could write faster assembly.  By 
the time he got done doing it in assembly, gcc 5 would probably be out 
generating much faster binaries, not to mention new major stable kernel 
revisions.
