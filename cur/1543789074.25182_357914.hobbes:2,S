True.  But there are other libcs available (e.g. klibc, dietlibc) too.  
I'd think that if the pages were bundled with the kernel, they should 
describe exactly what the kernel does, while pages bundled with a libc 
would describe any enhancements (or breakages) that the particular libc 
includes.  But then what to do about duplicates?  Or should the raw 
kernel interfaces have their own section, while libc interfaces remain 
in section 2?  Or should the libc versions typically replace the kernel 
versions on running systems?  Or 'patch' the existing kernel pages 
somehow?  So many questions... ;)

That was my though too; it's certainly easier to ask people to update 
manual pages in Documentation/ or man/ when they do a kernel patch than 
to ask them to download a separate package and make the changes (since 
they'll probably never get around to doing the latter :).

Ok, that's not too bad.  Having full, up-to-date man pages would be worth 
the extra few megs to me at least.

Many thanks to both of you then!
