Hi Paul,
Thanks for doing the exercise of removing the container part of cpuset
to provide some process aggregation.
With this model, I think I agree with you that RG can be split into
individual controllers (need to look at it closely).
I have few questions/concerns w.r.t this implementation:
- Since we are re-implementing anyways, why not use configfs instead of 
  having our own filesystem ?
- I am little nervous about notify_on_release, as RG would want 
  classes/RGs to be available even when there are no tasks or sub-
  classes. (Documentation says that the user level program can rmdir
  the container, which would be a problem). Can the user level program 
  be _not_ called when there are other subsystems registered ? Also,
  shouldn't it be cpuset specific, instead of global ?
- Export of the locks: These locks protect container data structures. 
  But, most of the usages in cpuset.c are to protect the cpuset data
  structure itself. Shouldn't the cpuset subsystem have its own locks ?
  IMO, these locks should be used by subsystem only when they want data
  integrity in the container data structure itself (like walking thru
  the sibling list).
- Tight coupling of subsystems: I like your idea (you mentioned in a 
  reply to the previous thread) of having an array of containers in task
  structure than the current implementation.
regards,
chandra
