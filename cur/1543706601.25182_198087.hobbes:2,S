Hi everybody!
I think there's one thing to change in kernel sources; consider this:
filp->f_mode & 2 || permission(filp->f_dentry->d_inode,2,NULL)
It's obvious to some, likely for others that "2" there really stands for
"002", the good old UNIX write permission. I'd suggest either to write
those permission bits in three-digit-octal, or introduce (maybe just use)
symbolic constants for improved readability.
One could even consider a macro MAY_WRITE(filp):
#define MAY_WRITE(filp) ((filp)->f_mode & WRITE_PERMISSION)
#define WRITE_PERMISSION 002
Regards,
Ulrich
