Subject: [PATCH] ia64: including <asm/signal.h> alone causes compilation errors
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

 Including *just* <asm/signal.h> on ia64 will result in a compilation failure,
 where it will succeed on every other architecture.
 Every other arch includes <linux/compiler.h> either directly or via
 <linux/types.h> at the top of <asm-*/signal.h>. ia64 includes
 <linux/types.h> after including <asm-generic/signal.h>, which causes
 the __user in <asm-generic/signal.h> to get passed through untouched, causing
 compilation errors.
 This patch moves the #include <linux/types.h> up to the beginning of signal.h,
 as found on every other arch.
 A specific example of where this behavior is observed is the recent addition
 of OCFS2. fs/ocfs2/cluster/userdlm.c seems alone in only including
 <asm/signal.h>, which seems to be perfectly valid.
 While I could have just fixed this in the OCFS2 code, I thought that making
 ia64 more consistent with the rest of the kernel would be the better fix.
