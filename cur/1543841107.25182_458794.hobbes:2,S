That may well have been f7f7f7f7f7... because several bits will have

If you force an fsck do you see any errors ? I guess not but if you have
a chance to check please do.
I'm not sure where F7 came from as it is not a poison value we typically
use. The fact the value is odd is also significant. Most of the kernel
deals in 1K block sizes so any error/corruption occurred fairly low down
once we got into sectors. That seems to rule out, for example, ext3
metadata corruption because it would be very strange drive geometry to
start a partition on an odd sector boundary, and the ext3 meta data
doesn't go down to sector granularity.
