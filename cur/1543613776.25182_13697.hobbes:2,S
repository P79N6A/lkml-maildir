Heh.
Aside of a _big_ problem with exposing async API to userland (for a
lot of reasons, including usual quality of async code in general and
event-drivel one in particular) there is more specific one - Ben's
long-promised full-async writepage() and friends.  I'll believe it
when I see it and so far it didn't appear.
So for the time being I'm staying the fsck out of that - I don't like
it, but I'm sick and tired of this sort of religious wars.
