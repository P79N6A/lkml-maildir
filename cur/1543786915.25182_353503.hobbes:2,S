I'd like to thank Vitaly and Philipp for their work, which was probably useful
at the time, but I've always wondered - when cleaning up code, should such comments
be removed too, or left as historical reminders?  The MAINTAINERS file seems
to get cleaned most of the time, the CREDITS doesn't - which way should
in-source comments go?
