IMHO, there are several cases for some type of TCP/IP offload.  One is for 
embedded systems that are just not capable of doing 1Gbps+.  Another is with 
10GbE, even high end servers will not be able keep up with TCP 
processing/data movement at these speeds.  Not being proactive in adopting 
TCP/IP offload will force Linux into accepting some scheme that will not 
necissarily be best.
