For each kernel and patch on kernel.org there is a corresponding .sign
file.  This is a detached signature file that can be used to verify
that the kernel came from the kernel maintainers and that it has not
been modified since signing.  The process for verifying these
signatures is quite easy.
On a valid kernel you will see something like this:
.::jasonc@panacea::.~> gpg --verify linux-2.4.18.tar.gz.sign linux-2.4.18.tar.gz
gpg: Signature made Mon Feb 25 14:42:44 2002 EST using DSA key ID 517D0F0E
gpg: Good signature from "Linux Kernel Archives Verification Key <ftpadmin@kernel.org>"
On a bad signature:
.::jasonc@panacea::.~> gpg --verify linux-2.4.18.tar.gz.sign linux-2.4.18.tar.gz
gpg: Signature made Mon Feb 25 14:42:44 2002 EST using DSA key ID 517D0F0E
gpg: BAD signature from "Linux Kernel Archives Verification Key <ftpadmin@kernel.org>"
