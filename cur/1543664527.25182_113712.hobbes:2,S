Yep, I know :)
The point of nightly snapshots is more for users use and testing 
purposes.  The csets are very useful for developers, but a bit of a 
moving target for users.  If users are using the per-cset snapshots, 
then it becomes a non-trivial chore to developers to track down exactly 
what version of the kernel a problem is reported against.
