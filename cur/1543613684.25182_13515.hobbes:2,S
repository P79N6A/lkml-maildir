That puts an awful lot of smarts into bootloader and creates code duplication
for no good reason.
We _already_ have code for loading modules.  And it's going to stay, no
matter what happens on boot.  So why the hell duplicate that in $BIGNUM
unrelated pieces of software (LILO, SYSLINUX, MILO, SILO, etc.)?  Just
to create extra fun with debugging?
