Hi,
Compilation of the 2.2.15pre15 kernel failed with the following
error messages in the final link step:
  fs/fs.o: In function `sys_quotactl':
  fs/fs.o(.text+0x15ff9): undefined reference to `in_egroup_p'
For triggering this error it should be sufficient to enable
quota support.
As far as I could find out this is due to a change between
2.2.14 and 2.2.15pre15 in the file fs/dquot.c:
1587c1585
< 			     (type == GRPQUOTA && in_group_p(id))) &&
---
> 			     (type == GRPQUOTA && !in_egroup_p(id))) &&
where the former is from 2.2.14 and the later from 2.2.15pre15.
I have not attempted to find the reasons for this change but the
function is definitely not available because it is defined as
  static int in_egroup_p(gid_t grp)
in line 353 of kernel/sysctl.c. 
   Kind regards,
     Konrad Bernloehr
