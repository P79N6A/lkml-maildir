Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Márton Németh <nm127@freemail.hu>
Extends the leds subsystem with a blink_set() callback function which can
be optionally implemented by a LED driver. If implemented, the driver can use
the hardware acceleration for blinking a LED.

+Hardware accelerated blink of LEDs
+==================================
+
+Some LEDs can be programmed to blink without any CPU interaction. To
+support this feature, a LED driver can optionally implement the
+blink_set() function (see <linux/leds.h>). If implemeted, the
+ledtrig-timer tries to use it. The blink_set() function should return
+0 if the blink setting is supported, or -EINVAL otherwise, which means
+that the LED will be turned on and off from software by the leds
+subsystem.
