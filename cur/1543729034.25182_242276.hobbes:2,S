The C3 does have one IIRC, but do Intel CPUs have it too? Also, there's
the question of trust - how random it truly is. Is it a partly
pseudo-RNG masked via encryption? /dev/random i know is random, driven
by random timings of real disks and real network packets. The CPU's HRNG
is much more encapsulated and can only be blackbox-tested.
