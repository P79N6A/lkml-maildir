Subject: Re: [PATCH] Whinge in paging_init if noexec is on with a non-PAE kernel

On second thought, this is probably better since most people will
presumably be booting non-PAE kernels, generating this message when
they've not tried to force the issue seems silly.
This way, the user will only see a warning if they actually go
out and specify "noexec=on" on the command line.
Sucks to have to do #ifdef #else though, I wonder if there's a
better way to initialize that.
Cheers,
