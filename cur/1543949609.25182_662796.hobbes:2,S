Yeah, that's what I thought too, when I got confused by these new
SLUB semantics that you made up. Actually if you look at SLAB,
it has very precise and rational semantics. SLUB should respect that.
If you really configure for tiny memory footprint, then I'm fine with
it going away. In that respect, it is still a hint (the callers can't
rely on it being a particular alignment), and that also applies for
SLAB_SMP_ALIGN, in case you are concerned that flags must only be hints.
