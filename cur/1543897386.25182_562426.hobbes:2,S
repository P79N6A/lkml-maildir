Agreed.

I don't know. The current behaviour will on average scan 16 entries.
For people manually tuning their hash to saner settings it will scan
a single entry. So we have a quite wide range of values already.
The single entry with sane hash settings is too little IMO, maybe use
some middle-ground, make it 8 by default as you did and rename the
constant. NF_CT_EVICTION_RANGE sounds fine.
