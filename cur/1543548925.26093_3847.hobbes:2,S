Okay. So, in effect, PCI is no longer a bus that drivers have to
know about, but a logical device. This is good. The stuff I've
been working on (2.2.+) doesn't have this capability. It will be
good when we have a stable version (err non-broken) of 2.4 for
me to port my drivers to. I just conldn't keep up with the continual
changes and sorta gave up for the time being.
