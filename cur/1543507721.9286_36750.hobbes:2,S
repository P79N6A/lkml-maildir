Are HJ's lockd patches really required on linux-2.2.12? As far as I
can see, 'nfsd-2.2.7-1.lock.patch' is already in the kernel.
'nfsd-2.2.7-2.lockd.patch' should in most cases not be necessary, but
if you do prefer to start lockd by hand rather than letting NFS do it,
then as far as I can see, the only thing that fails is the patch to
'svc.c'. You need to add
   do_lockdctl = NULL;
to 'cleanup_module(void)'.
As for the rest of HJ's 2.2.7 patches, I can't see any conflicts with
NFSv3. Where are you seeing them?
Cheers,
  Trond
