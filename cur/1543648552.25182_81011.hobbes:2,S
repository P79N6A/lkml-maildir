Hello,
I'm writing a driver for a PCI based application specific controller. Infact porting from OS/2.
I have couple of questions on caching problem ( i faced this when I worked on vxworks, PPC machine).
Our card has its own RAM and we are mapping and using that in the driver. Ours is a pentium target machine.
I'd like to know how to do cache flushing and cache invalidation in linux? 
Do we need to do it explicitly on a pentium/linux machine?
The other question is existing OS/2 implementation exports the hardware personalities (PCI I/O and memory base addresses) to the application and application takes control after that.
We need to use mmap to acheive the same as per requirement. 
Will there be any cache or any other issues on this regard?
Your answers would be helpful for us as we are in the design phase.
Warm Regards
Arun
