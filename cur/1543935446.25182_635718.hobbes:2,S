I don't think this is accurate. As I understand things, the reordering
happens within the Altix system interconnect -- nothing to do with the
PCI bridge hanging off this fabric.  It is "platform" behavior and I
think is properly handled within the dma_ API, which exists to
abstract platforms.

But:
 a) The Altix has PCI-X, not PCIe, so having something PCIe-specific
    is not a solution for this case; and
 b) the PCIe behavior is opt-in, in the sense that you have to
    specifically ask for looser ordering, while the Altix is loosely
    ordered unless you ask for this "flush" property.  So I don't
    think the same attribute will work for both cases.
