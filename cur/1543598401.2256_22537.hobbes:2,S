does this update the entropy count though? from previous 
discussions, i believe not, which iiuc means /dev/random will block 
just as frequently/infrequently irrespective of whether you feed 
stuff into /dev/random.
related: the i810 RNG has a driver, but it feeds data to /dev/random 
via a userspace daemon (rngd), so again entropy count is not changed.
kind of shame on the only mass-market RNG hardware out there.
