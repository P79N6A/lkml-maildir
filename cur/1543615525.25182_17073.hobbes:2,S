Software overridable cpuid strings are getting quick commonplace
in CPUs from several vendors.
I beleive the reasoning is that sometimes the lead time from
manufacture to marketing is long enough that the default power-on string
may not be correct, hence the BIOS can do the XP/MP descrimination, and
set accordingly. (Unless you've got a crap BIOS).
If anyone believes they have a BIOS which doesn't do this correctly,
(/proc/cpuinfo reports XP, and x86info reports MP or vice versa),
let me know, and I'll see what I can dig up.
