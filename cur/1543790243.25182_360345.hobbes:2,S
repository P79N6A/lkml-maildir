I may be misunderstanding things, but as I understand it the reason for 
calling hlt is to save power.
if you really care about the last bit of performance then useing idle=poll 
to make the TSC's stay synced makes perfect sense.
it's cases where you care about saving power that you would want to use 
hlt. can the power management be reasonably configured so that when things 
are running close to full-bore hlt isn't called, when things are more idle 
it switches to useing hlt and a non-TSC timesource or re-syncing the TSC 
on wakeup, and then if it's more idle then that it goes into the more 
traditional power saving modes where it works to shutdown individual CPU's 
(obviously having to re-sync the TSC when they wake up).
