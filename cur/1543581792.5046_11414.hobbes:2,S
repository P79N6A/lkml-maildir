I re-ran ksymoops and posted it again to the list.

I don't know. The server is in a different room from my office so all I saw was
the lock up and all I could do was copying the oops from screen. Our backup
regularily starts at 9 P.M., so I'm very confident that it 's gonna happen
again.
It did not happen with 2.2.18 or 2.2.19pre, that's for sure. With these kernel I
only had MM problems like vm_trying_to_free_unused_page etc.
