I didn't notice anything specific here about sys_remap_file_pages() vs.
truncate() (sans objrmap); did a fix fly by that I didn't notice,
or was it less of an issue than I thought it was?
Also, the OOM killer fails to check lowmem; basically it just needs
-       if (nr_swap_pages > 0)
+       if (nr_swap_pages > 0 && nr_free_buffer_pages() > 0)
With that in addition to the OOM killer locking patch I posted and
another to completely eliminate mm-less processes from consideration
64GB ia32 (with, of course, my oversized out-of-tree patch) recovers
from OOM instead of deadlocking after a mass-killing with swap online.
Not that I'd consider 64GB ia32 a supported platform for 2.5/2.6 (it's
a design limitation IMHO); it merely "stresses the OOM killer harder"
for the purposes of this discussion. Some kind of investigation is
probably needed to determine why eliminating mm-less processes from
consideration is necessary to obtain the desired behavior.
I'd be interested in more detailed descriptions of the user-level no
overcommit, dcacheicache, and truncated ext3 page issues after Thursday.

The latter sounds easy to address. It actually sounds like a 2.4.x
compatibility fix.
