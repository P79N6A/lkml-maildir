hai all,
     Is it possible to call call_usermodehelper from interrupt context.
I want to call a user program from the keyboard driver. When am calling, 
it is hanging, and giving the error that
    <0> Kernel panic : Aiee, killing interrupt handler
        In interrupt handler -- not syncing.
I am using Redhat linux 9.
Can anybody please help me.
  Thanks&Regards,
   P.Manohar,
