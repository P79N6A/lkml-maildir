So how are you testing the sysdev removal logic then if you can't remove
memory?
Oh, one thing, remove the link in unregister_memory, before you call
sysdev_unregister().  You are trying to get the name of a kobject, and
the whole object, that has just been blown away, not nice...
Which makes me believe your statement about this never being tested
before :)
