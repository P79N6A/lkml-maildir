i cant see how a ->children list that includes all children (traced and
untraced) can be useful. In fact it can be harmful: the debugger needs the
traced children to be on his own child-list, ie. there's a conflict of use
on the ->sibling list field. The ->ptrace_list entry is supposed to help
this situation - obviously use of ->ptrace_list and ->sibling has to be
mutually exclusive, no two parents can have the same task linked over
->sibling.
