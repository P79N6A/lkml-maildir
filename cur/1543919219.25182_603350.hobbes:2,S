Has this been tested on older implementations of powernow yet?
I'm happy to merge this and give it some time in -mm, before it
goes to mainline, but if no-one is testing on those older
opterons/turions etc then we're not going to know we regressed
until its too late.   If it hasn't been tested yet, any chance
you can scrounge some up at AMD and give it a spin just to be sure?
Thanks,
