Another source is the vger tree which is accessible via cvs from
cvs.on.openprojects.net. On the PPC, this is working on and off, 2.3.38
worked, 2.3.39 final right now doesn't, for lack of an
include/asm-ppc/ipcbuf.h file. 
I think the PPC kernel developers do a marvelous job, considering they
are outnumbered 100 to 1 by the Intel crowd and don't get much time to
catch up. 
A more serious problem is the lack of HFS support since the disappearing
act of the official maintainer last year. This would be a showstopper
for the 2.4 kernel on Pmacs (probably the largest non-Intel installed
user base by far).
