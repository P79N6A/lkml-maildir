Subject: [NUMA , x86_64] Why memnode_shift is chosen with the lowest possible value ?

Hi Andi
I have a dual Opteron machine, with 8GB of ram on each node.
With latest kernels I have high CPU profiles in mm/slab.c
kfree() is NUMA aware, so far so good, but the price seems heavy.
I noticed in 2.6.14-rc2 syslog :
Node 0 MemBase 0000000000000000 Limit 00000001ffffffff
Node 1 MemBase 0000000200000000 Limit 00000003ffffffff
Using 23 for the hash shift. Max adder is 3ffffffff
instead of previous (2.6.13) :
Node 0 MemBase 0000000000000000 Limit 00000001ffffffff
Node 1 MemBase 0000000200000000 Limit 00000003ffffffff
Using 27 for the hash shift. Max adder is 3ffffffff
After some code review, I see NODEMAPSIZE raised from 0xff to 0xfff
  phys_to_nid() is now reading one byte out of 2048 bytes with 
(memnode_shift=23, units of 8MB).
But shouldnt we try to use the highest possible value for memnode_shift ?
Using memnode_shift=33 would access only 2 bytes from this memnodemap[], 
touching fewer cache lines (well , one cache line). kfree() and friends would 
be slightly faster, at least cache friendly.
Another question is :
Could we add in pda (struct x8664_pda) the node of the cpu ?
We currently do :
#define numa_node_id()             (cpu_to_node(raw_smp_processor_id()))
Instead of reading the processor_id from pda, then access cpu_to_node[], we 
could directly get this information from pda.
#if defined(CONFIG_NUMA)
static inline __attribute_pure__ int numa_node_id() { return read_pda(node);}
#else
#define numa_node_id()             0
#endif
Thank you
Eric
