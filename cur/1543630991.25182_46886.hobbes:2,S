Yeah, that put the needed pressure for the patches to get accepted ;) I and
others had done most of that in the past but patches were getting lost in the

http://kerneljanitors.org/TODO
 had that listed for a long time 8)
Anyway, thanks again for the audit! :-)
And I'm all for something that is more easy to use, as I, like you, don't
want to keep auditing for the very same thing over and over again.
