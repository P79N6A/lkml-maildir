there are side effects which are visible with PROT_EXEC too, and even
the same kind...
with PROT_READ you may read even if you didn't specify it
with PROT_EXEC you may execute even if you didn't specifiy it
apps like JVM's forgot PROT_EXEC and break when the hardware enforces it
apps that forget PROT_READ break when the kernel/hardware enforce it
not too much difference....
