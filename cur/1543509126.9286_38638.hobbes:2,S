     What is the correct way to raise the number of descriptors a process can
have from the default of 1024?
     If I try to set it higher than 1024 using limit -n xxxx, it says,
"ulimit: bad limit: Operation not permitted".
     I tried changing:
#define NR_OPEN 1024
     .. to:
#define NR_OPEN 2048
     ... Then recompiled, the kernel booted up to a point but after mounting
swap space the machine seemed to hang with messages like:
get unused fd 0 not NULL.
     Is there some other way to tweak this?  Or is there something else I have
to bump up when I bump up NR_OPEN?  This is for a web server with a bunch of
virtual domains, each domain eats 3 descriptors. 
     Thanks!
