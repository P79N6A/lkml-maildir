Hi all,
	Interesting bug found in HFS last night, I think.
	Was doing a small project, and needed to access an HFS formatted
	zip. The zip is on the linux box, which is running RedHat 6.0, 
	with kernel 2.2.11, and netatalk 1.4b2. The Mac is running MacOS 8.6.
	In any case, tried to mount the zip with the afpd option, and 
	when the Mac tried to look at the zip, the connection was dropped,
	and the Mac locked until it dropped the connection and said that 
	it had insufficient privilege to open the network volume. Remounting
	without the afpd option allowed things to work, but without the
	info that I desired to have on the Mac for the resource forks.
	Tried an HFS cdrom too, and had the same results: would only work
	*without* the afpd option.
	Now, I know that this did work with the media I used under 2.0.37 
	and hfs_fs 0.95. So, what we have is a change in kernel, and possibly
	revision of HFS. The Mac has stayed in os versions above 8.
	Ideas?
Thanks in advance,
Victor
