Subject: Re: mbox archive of linux-kernel ?

Precedence: bulk

ftp.uwsg.indiana.edu carries most of the mbox-files, except for Apr-June 
2000 which are missing for some odd reason. So if anyone have any idea 
where I might find it in a convenient format I'd appriceate it. If you 
just need senders and subject I could mail you a sql-dump.
If you're going to parse them, I've found perl and Mail::Box very 
convenient.
