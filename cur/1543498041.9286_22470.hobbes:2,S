   I think that pre-eject checks belong to the drivers and their
attached sub-drivers only.
   We can simply introduce two driver hooks: soft_eject (the bus layer
notifies the driver that the user has requested device unplug; the driver
cleans up and returns whether unplug is possible or not) and hard_eject
(aka `we have just lost the device, don't ask why'; the driver cleans up,
revokes all open filehandles etc.).
   When a sub-device is attached to the device being ejected, the same
hook is called for all sub-devices before calling for the master device.
It introduces one minor problem which I'm not sure is worth the effort
needed to eliminate it: if it isn't possible to eject the device, we
still eject all sub-devices even if leaving everything in the original
stale would make a little more sense.
				Have a nice fortnight
