Ok, if to do s/correct/compliant/, here it is:
Section 2.3, page 7
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
A compliant compressor must produce streams with correct CMF, FLG and 
ADLER32, but need not support preset dictionaries.
...
A compliant decompressor must check CMF, FLG, and ADLER32, and
provide an error indication if any of these have incorrect values.
A compliant decompressor must give an error indication if CM is
not one of the values defined in this specification (only the
value 8 is permitted in this version), since another value could
indicate the presence of new features that would cause subsequent
data to be interpreted incorrectly
