I asked Linus for this a long time ago and he pointed out that you couldn't
make it work over NFS, at least not nicely.  It does seem like that could 
be worked around by having a "poll daemon" which knew about all the things
being waited on and checked them.  Or something.
I'd like it too.  And I'd like a callback for iocompletion, a way to do
preread(fd, len).
On the other hand, the fact that it doesn't exist on other platforms sort
of means that it isn't going anywhere.  In a sick sort of way, the most
likely way to make this happen is to get Microsoft to do it and then Linux
will do it as well and then the Solaris jocks will also fall in line.  The
only problem with that is that Microsoft can't design an OS interface to save 
their lives, so maybe Linux _should_ do it first.
