I tried the code from Hacker's Delight.
It is cool, but performance is CPU (and data) dependent:
Average # of usecs per operation:
		Hacker		Newton
Pentium 3	68.6	<	90.4
T2050		98.6	>	92.0
U1400		450	>	415
Xeon		70 	<	90
Xeon (newer)	71	<	78
EM64T		21.8	<	24.6
AMD64		23.4	<	32.0
It might be worth the change for code size reduction though.
