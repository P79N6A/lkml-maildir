After I sent my last message I realized the same thing... though I 
occasionally hear people talk about removing it (I seriously doubt that 
will ever happen).  I don't even think there's a way to disable type 1 
config access on Intel chipsets...
So the last patch is ok then, as long as we can find mmconfig space in 
the first place, but that's a separate problem for another set of 
patches (ones that seem to be working fairly well now btw).
