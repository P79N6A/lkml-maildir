   There is still a build dependency between the INET_AH/INET_ESP and
   CRYPTO_HMAC that the Kconfig does not cover.  The following trivial
   patch fixes it:
Other way around, these selections are made before crypto's
Kconfig is run so you cannot check this dependency.
The default is properly handled in crypto/Kconfig when these
protocols are defined, you should have a look.
If a user intentionally enabled INET_AH/INET_ESP et al. then forcibly
disobeys the default setting for the necessary crypto options, that is
their problem :-)
