I'm afraid this is pretty much wrong.  The scsi.h being referred to here
is the local scsi.h in the build directory, so it should be included as
a string.  For #include, "..." means begin the search in the local
directory (what is wanted here) and <...> means begin the search
starting with the predefined include paths.
The rest of the patch looks like a spurious (unrelated and undescribed)
downcasing of TRUE and FALSE.
