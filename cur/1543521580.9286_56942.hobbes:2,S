Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Hi. I have a new version of the 32-bit UID support patches for Linux
2.3.39pre2.
The patches are available at:
http://www.engin.umich.edu/caen/systems/Linux/code/misc/2.3/20000110/
Changes in this version:
	- updated to Linux 2.3.39pre2
	- merged with changes from Alan Cox
	- most of the backwards compatibility code has been moved into a
	  single source file, instead of being #ifdefed throughout various
	  files.
		(based on patch from Alan Cox)
Now you can see how much space the backwards compatibility code takes up:
(on i386)
$ ls -l kernel/uid16.o 
-rw-rw-r--   1 wing     wing         3740 Jan 10 18:51 kernel/uid16.o
$ strip uid16.o 
$ ls -l uid16.o 
-rw-rw-r--   1 wing     wing         2172 Jan 10 21:14 uid16.o
	- backwards compatibility moved to config option
	  (CONFIG_UID16_COMPAT), which is presently forced on for all
	  architectures that need it. This is used in the Makefile to
	  conditionally compile the backwards compatibility code when
	  needed.
	- more ifdefs removed, we're now down to just 10
	- fixed siginfo on sparc32, was broken in several previous patches
It is tested and working on the i386 architecture.
Thanks,
Chris Wing
