This has been seen on a number of different boxes running a variety of kernels.
The ones that have happened to other people that I have heard of have all
involved UML.  I've also make my laptop hang with BK, diff, and emacs.
Here are some threads talking about this problem:

There's a variety of kernels and hardware involved here.  My laptop is 
bog-standard IDE afaik.  Zaphod, the subject of the second URL, is IDE behind
a 3ware raid controller.  Not sure about the others.
