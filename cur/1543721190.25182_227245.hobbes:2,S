The change is only effective when IDE is built as a module.  It allows
you the option to have the same probing order as if IDE was built-in.
Without the patch it always probes the device as soon as each PCI driver
is loaded.  And you can still do that as long as ide-generic is loaded
before the PCI drivers.
Cheers,
