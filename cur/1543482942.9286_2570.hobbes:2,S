Part of the strategy, yes. The support for obsolete hw should not hinder 
the development progress nor high-end performance, but otherwise, 
there is no reason why every random bridge or X terminal should be a 
64-bit SMP SCSI-3 machine _or_ stay with a 10 yrs old kernel which 
doesn't happen to happen a random networking feature or a random cheap 
but recent video chip.  Being able to do useful things on i386 or SS5
proves Linux efficient, not necessarily obsolete.
OTOH, if somebody needs current vm sizes, they may need current 
processor technology - of course
