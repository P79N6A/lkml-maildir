Yes, but the way the bits are defined, the "pending" bit is not meaningful 
as a synchronization event, for example - because _other_ users can't 
trust it once they've dispatched the function. So even in the synchronous 
run/flush_scheduled_work() kind of situation, you end up having to work 
with the fact that nobody _else_ can rely on the data structures, and that 
they are designed to work that way..

Well, I simply committed my work that doesn't guarantee synchronization - 
the synchronization can now be added in kernel/workqueue.c any way we 
want. It's better than what we used to have, for sure, in both compiling 
and solving the practical problem, but also as a "go forward" point.
