Excellent idea.  At the volumes you are using it now that's $65M/year.
That's what we'd charge for the same number of seats at one commercial
site.  If it were spread out over the thousands of sites like your
usage is then it would be more, there's a lot more overhead.  There are
currently more than 2,200 top level domains using BK for free (where
top level means my-company.com, not my-workstation.my-company.com).
If someone wants to pay for it we'd be happy to negotiate a standard
click-wrap style license as part of the deal.  Everyone would like that
much better it seems.  Are you volunteering to pay?

Yup, it is.  Always has been even for the kernel because of our hard
work to make sure of that.  We respect your choices, please respect ours.
