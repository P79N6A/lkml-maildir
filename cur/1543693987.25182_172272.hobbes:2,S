Is there any special reason you take it around mm_release and exit_aio
too? I don't feel this is needed. exit_aio btw still assumes nobody can
race, so it doesn't take any spinlock (brlocks actually) to guard
against other aio threads, I believe that's ok since as worse the other
tasks can mangle the vm with ptrace, they'll never get to mess with aio,
only the current task can and the mm_user == 1 check guarantees we've no
sibiling threads. the mmap_sem shouldn't help exit_aio anyways, if
something it'll make it deadlock if there's any access to the VM that
generates a page fault in the cancel() callback.
So I suggest this sequence should be safe:
	mm_release();
	exit_aio(old_mm);
	down_write(&old_mm->mmap_sem);
	exit_mmap(old_mm);
	up_write(&old_mm->mmap_sem);
Please double check ;)
