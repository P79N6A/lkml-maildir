I never understood why the speed depends on AC power (except to fake a long
autonomy). It would be smarter if it scaled the speed based on CPU usage.
It's what I did on my notebook (athlon 1.3G), and I'm happy to run it all
the day at 500 MHz and not to hear its stupid CPU fan dancing every minute,
and I too am happy to be able to compile a kernel in 3 minutes even on
battery, when it would take 10 min at 500 MHz and eat the battery much more,
since LCD and disk eat power during 7 more minutes.
Just my thought...
Cheers,
Willy
