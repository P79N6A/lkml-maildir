I think this is the cleanup of all the open coded masking and offset
to index type of operations that get done over and over again everywhere.

Backed up behind real work ;)
The test was writing a single 50GB file to a fresh filesystem, and
then reading it back. Run on two different dm stripes - a 4-disk
RAID) and a 8disk RAID0 stripe, with a stripe unit of 512k.  Disks
are 10krpm SAS, external jbod on PCI-X good for ~850MB/s read and
~750MB/s write.  Server is 4p intel x86_64 with 16GB RAM.
                    READ            WRITE
blksz  disks     tput   sys       tput    sys

Throughput in MB/s.
So, there's some interaction between reads and large block size;
may be related to readahead but i haven't looked into I/O
patterns at this stage.
More results soonish.....
Cheers,
Dave.
