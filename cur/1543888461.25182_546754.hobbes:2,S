Mybe I am wrong, but if you are detecting 40-wire cable to set them to 
DMA/33, why the check includes also 80-wire cables configuring them to 
DMA/33 too?
With this patch my nvidia4 IDE controllers detects correctly and configure 
correctly DMA/100 for my HD and DMA/33 for my DVD (the first uses a 
80-wire cable, the second a 40-wire cable).
Am I wrong somewhere?
