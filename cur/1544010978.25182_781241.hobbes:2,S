Sorry, I forgot to remove that when I realized you were referring to
jiffies as a unit here.  Don't worry, I got it.

The only problem I see is the `is'.  It should be called
	time_after_jiffies()
But time doesn't refer to `the current time' in the first place!  The
macro is not (meant to be) an English sentence.
'time' is the prefix for a group of symbols, a namespace if you will
and it stands for the first argument in all these macros. 'is_after'
is the relation.  'jiffies' the thing you compare with.  It's an infix
operator used in prefix form.
The only problem that I see with the jiffies-comparing macros is the
`is'.  They should be called time_after_jiffies() and
time_before_jiffies() etc.

They are probably written in a natural language.

I don't think there are many functions/macros in the (core-)kernel
that have the types they operate on encoded in their names.
So interpreting the macro the way you did makes no sense to me
regarding the code in context.

How would you name the existing time_after() then?
