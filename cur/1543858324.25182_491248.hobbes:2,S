Actually, you can... but wether you want is a different story :-)
You can simply mask it, have it handled by userspace and re-enable it
when that's done. Though say hello to horrible interrupt latencies and
hope you aren't sharing it with anything critical...
I don't mean I -like- the approach... I just say it can be made to
sort-of work. But I don't see the point.
Ben.
