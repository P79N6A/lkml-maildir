In OOP speak, VFS is an abstract class, each individual filesystem derives
from this class giving a concrete class, a specific on-disk (or whereever)
filesystem is an object of its (concrete) class. The rest of the kernel (as
a client) doesn't care for the concrete classes, it speaks only (or mostly)
in terms of the abstract class (VFS). And concrete filesystems in turn use
the generic block layer.

No. Sounds jumbled up and backwards. And I don't see how "languages" could
even enter the picture here.
Again: Is there any (sane) way the /existing/ VFS can be used to express
what you want? What are the /minimal/ changes to VFS so each extension can
be catered for in an uniform way across filesystems (anything else destroys
the core idea of having a VFS in the first place!)? What are the required
changes in the clients of VFS (i.e., changes to the core kernel)? What
would be the impact on existing filesystems that /don't/ use new
functionality (this is a lot harder, because it impacts many independent
pieces of code)? What would be required for an existing filesystem to
incorporate it?
When all this is answered, go over the implementation details. But that is
far off still.
