There is *no point* making these module parameters. There is no other
watchdog that works in exactly the same way but using different io
ports. If there was this still wouldnt be the sensible way to do it.

where did that 63 come from? should be 255.
Also, generally, please cc authors when you send patches. And making the comments the
same in the watchdog drivers is a complete  waste of time. If you want to reduce
the amount of duplicated code in the drivers you could make a watchdog_ops interface
for almost all of them.
