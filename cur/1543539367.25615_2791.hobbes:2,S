Subject: Network Card stops responding while using NFS

I seem to be having a problem with my network card cutting out on me when I'm
heavily accessing a remote NFS account.  No matter what I do (ifconfig eth0
down/up or removing/inserting network card module) the interface remains
down.  I get nothing in the logs on either machine, well except that my NFS
connection went away on the client.
The only way to get the network card back is to reboot the machine.  I don't
believe the problem is related to anything on the server machine but I'm not
positive.  I haven't been able to reproduce the problem with anything but a
massive copy from a NFS mounted partition.
If any more information is needed please feel free to ask.
Information:
Network Card:  Realtek 8029
Network Module: ne2k-pci
Both Machines have the same card.
Kernel Version (Server): 2.4.0-test3 (Also has been 2.2.16)
Kernel Version (Client): 2.4.0-test3 SMP (I've tried several 2.3 series as well
as
2.4 test1/2)
Client is an Dual Celeron(500 mhz) with 256 MB
Server is a AMD K6(450 mhz) with 128 MB
NFS Version (Server): kmountd nfs-utils 0.1.7 / Universal NFS Server 2.2beta47
I tried both version of the nfs server on the machine with similar results each
time.  I have tried both versions on the client machine as well, but that
shouldn't make a difference, right?
Relevant Log Entries on Server:
