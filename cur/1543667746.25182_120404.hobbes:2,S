Exactly.
Alan, if we want to keep ata_unused, we should remove
list_add_tail(%drive->list, &ata_unused) from ata_attach()
and perhaps use (after fixing it to handle idedefault_driver)
ide_replace_subdriver() for driver switching for drives owned
by idedefault_driver.
BTW in ide_register_driver() we don't use ide_drives lock to protect
    drive->list changes, why?
