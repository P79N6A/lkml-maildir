There's a known problem with OpenOffice and its use of sched_yield(). 
sched_yield() got changed in 2.6 and it makes OO unusable when there is
other stuff happening.
Apparently it has been fixed in recent OpenOffice versions.  If you cannot
reproduce this problem in any other application I'd be saying it is "not a
bug".
