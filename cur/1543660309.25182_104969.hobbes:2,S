I see. I think it's a design problem then. The rule card -> one driver is
bad. We need something between card and device which will take care about
drivers. Unfortunately, this information is dynamic (only driver knows
which devices have to be attached).
I think that we need to discuss this thing very carefully.

Yes, but IT SHOULD WORK. Although it isn't an most efficient way. (I
personally think that it's better to keep as much IDs as possible to avoid
clashes in future).
