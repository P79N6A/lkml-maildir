It should work. long are 64bit on Linux x86_64 or FreeBSD amd64. And
most if not all newer servers support that 'long mode'.

Actually if you have to blame, you'd blame GNU, not the kernel.)
I think that GNU/Linux was supporting large file in a different way
from *BSD as you think was because they were afraid making off_t 64bit
would break old wrong things. And there are also other considerations.
Then they introduced off64_t or loff_t.
But the above does not cover all the facts. On Linux/x86_64, off_t is
64 bit too. The library has things like _FILE_OFFSET_BITS,
__USE_FILE_OFFSET64 and typedef __off64_t off_t, check
/usr/include/unistd.h.

Is Postfix has a large file model?

I think the pre-built libraries in an amd64 distro are already done so.
So my proposal is using long for var_mailbox_limit et al in order to
get rid of the 2G limit on amd64. And if that is acceptable, I'd like
to try.
