Highspeed networks are often significantly faster than memory subsystems.
Recently I've seen a GSN network card which interfaces with two memory
subsystems on an Origin 2000 just because a single one doesn't deliver
the bandwidth ...  Copying?  No way, in that league you can do everything
with your data just not look touch it.  A GSN successor is being
discussed ...
