Hi, 
we have seen it, too. Seems to be graphics card dependend (ati ones are not 
effected, but nvidia cards are ) and what powersaving mode is enabled in the 
BIOS (Suspend for the Monitor causes a lock up when switching from X to the 
console, but when using VSync/empty screen (or something like this) all works 
fine).
