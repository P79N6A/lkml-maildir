I don't really understand why a kernel patch is needed to have a uniq
PID for a thread. I would have implemented a getpid() in the libpthread
(hiding the getpid() from libc), as well as a getppid().
The libpthread getpid() return value will be the PID of the thread manager,
and getppid() the PID of the parent of the first thread created. In order
to get the actual pid of the thread, then you will have to use __getpid().
The same mechanism would also be implemented for getppid().
I don't think that this may break anything (except for older programs using
getpid() with a wrong POSIX semantic), since __getpid() should not be used
in portable pthreaded programs; and the big advantage is to run on any
actual kernel with a getpid()/getppid() POSIX-semantics.
