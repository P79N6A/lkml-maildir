That's an incredibly huge amount of system ram :)
Have you done a BIOS update between the kernel upgrades by any chance ?
Or altered any options in the BIOS ?
Does booting the older kernel definitly still work ?
AFAIR, we don't touch the first MTRR, that's typically set up
by the BIOS before we even boot.
