the main problem is that we can do nothing with this matrix: we only 
print it, but then the values get written into a 0/1 sched-domains 
hierarchy - so the information is lost.
if you create a sched-domains hierarchy (based on the SLIT tables, or in 
whatever other way) that matches the CPU hierarchy then you'll 
automatically get the proper distances detected.
