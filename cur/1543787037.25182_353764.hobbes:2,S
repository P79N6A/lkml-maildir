You might try disabling USB Legacy support in the BIOS and see if that 
helps. It would seem the BIOS likely has some bugs in the code that is 
supposed to handle handoff of the OHCI controller from the BIOS SMM code 
(that does USB legacy) to the OS. I haven't heard of such problems on 
other NF4 boards (I have one) so I'm assuming it's something in the ECS 
BIOS.
