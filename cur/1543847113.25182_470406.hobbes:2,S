Someone needs to fix ARM - I'm told it's utterly broken at the moment.
Since I'm on holiday (and the machine with the git trees on is powered
off and there's no way I can power it on) it's someone elses job. 8)
I'm not likely to be in a position to fix this before next Wednesday in
any case.
If it's obvious and trivial, it should be easy for anyone to fix, even
the person who broke it.  Especially as there are build logs automatically
generated for every -git tree at
