Hi,
After a little struggle with 2.5.50 and it's new modules system I got
things running on my Toshiba laptop.
Now there's a couple of things:
1) I get these messages while typing just normal stuff on my keyboard:
| Dec  1 00:28:00 misery kernel: atkbd.c: Unknown key (set 2, scancode 0x96, on isa0060/serio0) pressed.
| Dec  1 00:28:10 misery kernel: atkbd.c: Unknown key (set 2, scancode 0xae, on isa0060/serio0) pressed.
| Dec  1 00:28:13 misery kernel: atkbd.c: Unknown key (set 2, scancode 0x91, on isa0060/serio0) pressed.
| Dec  1 00:28:23 misery kernel: atkbd.c: Unknown key (set 2, scancode 0xa3, on isa0060/serio0) pressed.
| Dec  1 00:28:38 misery kernel: atkbd.c: Unknown key (set 2, scancode 0xa6, on isa0060/serio0) pressed.
I'm not doing anything funny at that moment, just typing commands.
Messaged appear at a random interval and at random keys.
2) Apparently when one boots 2.5.50 without having the newest
module-init-tools, the kernel panics while doing a shutdown.
Unfortunately I can't give much more information, because now I have the
new module-init-tools, and when it happened, all I could see was the
last bit of the panic.
Lastly, while loading modules:
| [0:57] [root@misery:~] # modprobe trident
| WARNING: Error inserting ac97_codec
| (/lib/modules/2.5.50/kernel/ac97_codec.o): Invalid module format
| FATAL: Error inserting trident (/lib/modules/2.5.50/kernel/trident.o):
| Unknown symbol in module
| zsh: 456 exit 1     modprobe trident
| [0:57] [root@misery:~] # 
'trident' is the driver for my laptop's soundcard. But it fails to load.
HTH,
Sander.
