Ok, thinking about this obfuscated code more, it would appear so.  It
would also appear that when the suspend request comes from the APM bios,
the ioctl() method will not call send_event() at all - instead it comes
from check_events().
However, as I said previously, this is a minor issue.  I'd rather the
major problem was fixed.
