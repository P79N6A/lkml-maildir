I repeat what I'd said, "I'm not arguing this means Windows 95 is a good
design, but rather that it is not as much a stumbling block for users as
you're making out".
And I find the whole "we" rhetoric very tiring. Linux isn't a homogenous
all-agreeing whole. You can speak for yourself, but try not to speak for
all Linux users as if you're the group-appointed spokesperson.

And these users have enough brains to tar up directories before treating
them like flat files. If they aren't smart enough to do this, then maybe
they should stick to the GUI.

I repeat myself, "People who do use the command line will understand the
implications and will move the entire directory (using tar, or recursive
copy)".

Why?! Command lines don't have icons. Command lines don't show directory
trees next to files. Command lines don't support URL or FTP windows like
kfm or gmc does. Command lines don't support "tgz windows". [1]
The differences are already fundamental and vast. You are trying to bail
water from the ship with a thimble. It's a pointless exercise to try and
make the command line like the GUI in this tiny (not needed) way.
[1] Midnight commander does, but midnight commander and their ilk are in
reality more like GUI apps (they provide a unique environment that tries
hard to isolate the user from the command line).

I'm saying that a GUI app can use tar and recursive copy as well.

If you want the tools to behave differently, fix the tools, don't change
the way the kernel works. The kernel provides mechanism not policy. User
space is what provides policy. The kernel provides the means to do so.
<DONT RESPOND HERE, READ BOTH PARAGRAPHS FOR CONTEXT>
You can do the forked files in userspace. Your arguments so far are that
you do not want to fix the hundreds of command line tools which will not
understand. This is an argument of laziness, not of elegant design.

I'm suggesting you're intentionally creating strawmen (3 so far). It has
no merit to create obviously stupid arguments and then pretend that your
opponent is arguing this way. Stop doing it.

Programmers are even smarter than command line users, they're definitely
smart enough to popen("tar czvf albod") instead of open("albod", 1). I'm
of the opinion that normal users can figure this out too.
And that's your 4th strawman. I'm not a DOS user, I'm not arguing from a
DOS perspective, so stop trying to imply that anyone that disagrees with
you is simply a stupid "non-UNIX" person.
