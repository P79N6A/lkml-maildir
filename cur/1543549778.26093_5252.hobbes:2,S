I've been away on a conference last week, so I haven't
had much chance to take a look at the code after you
integrated it and the test base got increased ;(
One thing I discovered are some UP-only deadlocks and
the page ping-pong thing, which I am fixing right now.
If I had a choice, I'd have chosen /next/ week as the
time to integrate the code ... doing this while I'm 
away at a conference was really inconvenient ;)
I'm looking into the email backlog and the bug reports
right now (today, tuesday and wednesday I'm at /another/
conferenc and thursday will be the next opportunity).
It looks like ther are no fundamental issues left, just
a bunch of small thinkos that can be fixed in a (few?)
week(s).
regards,
Rik
