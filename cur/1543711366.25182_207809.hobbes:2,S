Hi,
A first release of a collected barrier patchset for 2.6.5-rc1-mm2. I
have a few changes planned to support dm/md + sata, I'll do those
changes over the weekend.
Reiser has the best barrier support, ext3 works but only if things don't
go wrong. So only attempt to use the barrier feature on ext3 if on ide
drives, not SCSI nor SATA.
Also note that for reiser you need to add:
	-o barrier=flush
while ext3 currently wants:
	-o barrier=1
Cosmetic stuff that will get ironed out. You can find the patches here:
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/axboe/patches/v2.6/2.6.5-rc1-mm2/
ide-barrier-2.6.5-rc1-mm2-1
	ide/core part
ext3-barrier-2.6.5-rc1-mm2-1
	ext3 part
reiserfs-current-2.6.5-rc1-mm2-1
	current reiser tree, get it here in parts:
	ftp.suse.com/pub/people/mason/patches/data-logging/experimental/2.6.4
	(use series.mm for apply order)
reiserfs-barrier-2.6.5-rc1-mm2-1
	reiser part.
or just apply
all-barrier-2.6.5-rc1-mm2-1
	all rolled up into one patch.
