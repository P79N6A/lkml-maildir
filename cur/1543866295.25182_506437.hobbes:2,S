ufs_fs.h certainly has things which certain types of userspace
programs could use:
on-disk layouts of UFS(2) inodes, cylinder groups, ... So it should be exported.
However, NAK patch in this form until all kernel internal things would
dissapear from
exported header: struct ufs_buffer_head, ufs_sb_private_info. Probably something
else, I haven't looked closely.
