  There is a natural order for presenting variables to the
user, and that's the menu tree order.  At least in the Linux
kernel CML2 corpus the menus are roughly organised from most
general to most specific options, so options appearing earlier
in the tree are likely to appear in more constraints and you
probably want to ask the user to mutate them later.
