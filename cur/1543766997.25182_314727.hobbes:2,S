the table which shows the size limits depending upon the files system...
___________________________________________________________
File System     File Size [Byte]   File System Size [Byte]
____________________________________________________________
Ext2 or Ext3 (1 kB block size)   2^34 (16 GB)   2^41 (2 TB)
Ext2 or Ext3 (2 kB block size)   2^38 (256 GB)   2^43 (8 TB)
Ext2 or Ext3 (4 kB block size)   2^41 (2 TB)   2^44 (16 TB)
Ext2 or Ext3 (8 kB block size)   2^46 (64 TB)   2^45 (32 TB)
ReiserFS 3.5     2^32 (4 GB)   2^44 (16 TB)
ReiserFS 3.6 (under Linux 2.4)    2^60 (1 EB)   2^44 (16 TB)
XFS      2^63 (8 EB)   2^63 (8 EB)
JFS (512 Bytes block size)   2^63 (8 EB)   2^49 (512 TB)
JFS (4 kB block size)    2^63 (8 EB)   2^52 (4 PB)
NFSv2 (client side)    2^31 (2 GB)   2^63 (8 EB)
NFSv3 (client side)    2^63 (8 EB)   2^63 (8 EB)

apart from this the following kernel limits exist:
On 32-bit systems with Kernel 2.4.x: The size of a file and a block device
is limited to 2 TiB. By using LVM several block devices can be combined
enabling the handling of larger file systems.
64-bit systems: The sizes of a filesytem and of a file are limited by 2^63
(8 EiB). But there might be hardware driver limits that do not allow to
access such large devices.
Kernel 2.6: For both 32-bit systems with option CONFIG_LBD set and for
64-bit systems: The size of a file system is limited to 2^73 (far too much
for today). On 32-bit systems (without CONFIG_LBD set) the size of a file is
limited to 2 TiB. Note that not all filesystems and hardware drivers might
handle such large filesystems.
