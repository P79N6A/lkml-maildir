Say again?
From drivers/video/fbmem.c:
static ssize_t
fb_write(struct file *file, const char *buf, size_t count, loff_t *ppos)
{
static ssize_t
fb_read(struct file *file, char *buf, size_t count, loff_t *ppos)
{
Yes you can read/write to the frame buffer memory, though in most
cases it makes a lot more sense to mmap() it and access it directly.
