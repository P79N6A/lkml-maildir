If you want to take advantage of all that memory to buffer disk writes, 
so that the reads can proceed better, you might want to tweak your 
/proc/sys/vm/dirty_ratio amd /proc/sys/vm/dirty_background_ratio to more 
appropriate values. (maybe also dirty_writeback_centisecs and 
dirty_expire_centisecs)
You can read all about those tunables in Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt.
Just my 2 cents,
