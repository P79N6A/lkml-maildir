You don't say what eth0 is.  At a guess, it's a prism54 card, because the
only place I find that message in the kernel is in the prism54 driver:
drivers/net/wireless/prism54/islpci_dev.c:
	printk(KERN_DEBUG "Assuming someone else called the IRQ\n");
I'd imagine that the OHCI1394 generates a fair number of interrupts,
so... this highlights the problem of leaving debugging printk's,
even at KERN_DEBUG level in a driver interrupt path.
At a guess, Luis R. Rodriguez may be the maintainer for prism54,
so...
