Hi,
	I'm testing acpi changes and unfortunately all the debug messages
overflow the log buffer. So I decided to increase CONFIG_LOG_BUF_SHIFT 
in .config (there was a menu entry for this at some time in menuconfig
but I can't find it anymore).
	Anyway no matter what I do the value seems to be reseted to 14 at build
time. Is there a way to cleanly change it without poking directly into
the kernel source code ?
Regards,
[ Please CC me answers as I only skim the list via marc ]
