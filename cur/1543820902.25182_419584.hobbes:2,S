What happened to that part of the slab allocator? Looks completely  
changed to when I saw it the last time?
This directly fails in kmem_cache_destroy?
So it tries to free all the slab entries from the free list and then 
returns 1 or 2 if there are entries left on the partial and full 
list? So the bug happens if cache entries are left.
Guess the reason for this failure is then that not all cache entries have 
been freed before calling kmem_cache_destroy()?
