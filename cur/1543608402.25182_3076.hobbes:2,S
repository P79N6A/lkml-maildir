Hi All,
We are getting the message "VM: Killing process pimd" when we are
running our application pimd. Found from somewhere that this a OOM
situation. We used a memory leak finding tool "ccmalloc" and found
that our applicaition is not leaking any memory. 
Info abt pimd:
Our application is interacting with the kernel, which(kernel) will 
give the packets it received from the network to the "pimd"
through a socket(for taking some decisions). This happens only when 
the packets arrive at a high data rate(say 100MBPS in ethernet LAN).
We found that during this happens, the kernel is giving each packet
(multicast) it receives to the application and the application is 
dropping it. 
After sometime we get a message "VM:killing process pimd" and pimd
gets killed. Or we get message for every packet saying copy_to_user()
failed. 
Is this a 
- memory leakage problem with our application or
- Memory leakage with the kernel patches we made or
- due to packets coming at the very high rate and each packet 
  is sent to user thru a socket which eventually might get full.
Any idea on how to handle(avoid) this? Are we not supposed to send
packets at this high rate to the user space? 
Thanks in advance
Siva
