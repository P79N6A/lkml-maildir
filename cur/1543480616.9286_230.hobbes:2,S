It would be nice to return the complement, but I think that could
backfire. It makes the press release hard for many people to accept.
As it is, "upgrade path to Linux" could trigger a reaction in some
people.
This issue is a bit like advocacy that says "Linux doesn't crash
like NT does". For many people, NT does not crash. These people
will not trust you anymore. Everything you say is suspect.
Maybe:
* Easy access to documents stored on NTFS-format hard disks.
  This NT compatability support provides an upgrade path to Linux,
  providing freedom from license costs and usage tracking.
Hmmm? Too long? Too unrelated?
