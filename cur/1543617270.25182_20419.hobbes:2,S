It would make me feel better, but it would defeat the purpose.
There's a lot of code holding semaphores.

But it's easier to fix. If you can preempt only by explicitely
sleeping, you can beat priority invasion by changing basically
only wake_up. If you can be preempted at random, you need to know
who holds a semaphore.
