Thanks! We also have found that already! Shame on me ...

I will eliminate the global variable anyway, since I can
get the superblock also from the inode:
+static ssize_t hypfs_aio_write(struct kiocb *iocb, const char __user *buf,
+                               size_t count, loff_t pos)
+{
+       int rc;
+       struct super_block *sb;
+
+       mutex_lock(&hypfs_lock);
+       sb = iocb->ki_filp->f_dentry->d_inode->i_sb;
+       if (last_update_time == get_seconds()) {
+               rc = -EBUSY;
+               goto out;
+       }
+       hypfs_delete_tree(sb->s_root);
+       rc = diag_create_files(sb, sb->s_root);
+       if (rc) {
+               printk(KERN_ERR "hypfs: Update failed\n");
+               hypfs_delete_tree(sb->s_root);
+               goto out;
+       }
+       hypfs_update_update();
+       rc = count;
+      out:
+       mutex_unlock(&hypfs_lock);
+       return rc;
+}
Hmmm... sure, you could use remount to trigger the update.
One advantage of remount is that we do not need the hypfs_lock,
right. But having the hypfs lock needs only three lines
of code and therefore this is not really a strong argument
in my eyes.
I think one disadvantage of the remount mechanism is that it
is not as intuitive as the update attribute. If you have
an update file, it is clear that writing to that file
triggers an update. That a remount triggers an update
seems to be less intuitive for me.
But the bigger disadvantage is that only root (or any user
if you specify 'user' in /etc/fstab) can trigger
the update with remount. We want to allow also other users
to trigger the update and read the attributes. The current
implementation for that is to specify uid and gid as mount
option to define the owner of the files. For example you
can run a user space program with uid xxx and specify
uid=xxx as mount option to allow the program to update
and read the data.
