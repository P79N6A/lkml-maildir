I'd say you guessed why this keeps getting ignored. (I have binutils
2.8.1.0.1 right now.) You could submit the patch again in a few years.
Another reason: People who can write 16-bit x86 assembly are likely to
be ex-DOS hackers with MASM and TASM experience. To them, gas syntax
may be hard to use.
