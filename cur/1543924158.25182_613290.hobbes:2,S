Each IP compression tunnel instance does an alloc_percpu().
Since you're the one who wants to change the semantics and guarentees
of this interface, perhaps it might help if you did some greps around
the tree to see how alloc_percpu() is actually used.  That's what
I did when I started running into trouble with your patches.
You cannot put limits of the amount of alloc_percpu() memory available
to clients, please let's proceed with that basic understanding in
mind.  We're wasting a ton of time discussing this fundamental issue.
