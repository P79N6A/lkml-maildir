No, that should be "hdparm -a0 /dev/hda" (lowercase "-a").
And the same "-a" for all of your other test variants.
If you did it all with "-A", then the results are invalid,
and need to be redone.
The hdparm manpage explains this, but in a nutshell, "-A" is the
low-level drive firmware "look-ahead" mechanism, whereas "-a" is
the Linux kernel "read-ahead" scheme.
In general, most uppercase hdparm flags are drive *firmware* settings.
