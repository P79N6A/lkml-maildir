Ok, detailed answers for each one.

For these two, I'm waiting mainline answers - the first one was tested and 
worked, while the second not, but is no more intrusive. In general, the 
patches themselves are good: hostfs already makes full use of the page cache.
My doubt (which actually is not related to the patches themselves) is here:
static struct address_space_operations hostfs_aops = {
        .writepage      = hostfs_writepage,
        .readpage       = hostfs_readpage,
/*      .set_page_dirty = __set_page_dirty_nobuffers, */
        .prepare_write  = hostfs_prepare_write,
        .commit_write   = hostfs_commit_write
};
Actually, hostfs is a nodev filesystem, but I simply don't know if that 
implies that it uses no buffers. So, should
 .set_page_dirty = __set_page_dirty_nobuffers
be uncommented? Or should it be deleted (leaving it there is not a good 
option).
I'm holding the patches because I don't know if using them could anyhow 
trigger data loss from this bug, if it's a bug.

I don't know technically this one. It won't probably go in 2.6.10, I think 
later... tested in the SuSE tree, but let's be quiet in merging _big_ things, 
ok? It was also tested in a different tree, so it perfectly working on 2.6.9 
does not mean perfectly working on current kernels.
Some other well tested patches (not these ones) are causing host problems, 
i.e. UML processes crashing and staying in D state (this seems some kind of 
ptrace bug, but still digging on this) - acked on 2.6.9 hosts.
Or dying completely but keeping some FS (a tmpfs mount used only for UML) from 
being unmounted (yes, checked lsof, which shows nothing - I've heard rumors 
of locks alive). It does not seem to be related to tmpfs in particular, 
however.

These are littler and somehow widely tested... but nobody complained with the 
1st alone.
