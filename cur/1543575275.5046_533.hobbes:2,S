I've tried the patch putting a 4 in the place noted above. It doesn't
help with the issue at all. Also interesting is the fact that my kernel
hangs upon bootup around starting syslogd/klogd or around setting up the
NIC (haven't quite figured out), if I pull the network plug and continues
when I plug it back in.
