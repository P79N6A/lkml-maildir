i have released the -V0.7.27-3 Real-Time Preemption patch, which can be
downloaded from the usual place:
	
http://redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/
this is another quick update to fix a couple of bugs. Sorry about the
fast pace of updates but these fixes are worth having ASAP:
Changes since a -V0.7.27-1:
 - fix module-put BKL count bug - this could explain/fix the lockups
   reported by Rui Nuno Capela.
 - fixed a netfilter related networking deadlock reported by Mark H. 
   Johnson two weeks ago, it triggered on my testbox today. This (rare)
   bug could potentially explain some of the other lockup reports that
   are still open.
 - fix load average constant +1.0 offset when PREEMPT_RT is enabled. 
   This was an artifact of the IRQ-threading of the timer interrupt.
to create a -V0.7.27-3 tree from scratch, the patching order is:
