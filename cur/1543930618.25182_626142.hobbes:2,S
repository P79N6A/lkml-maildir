Hm, you seem to be hitting the "another_slab" stuff in __slab_alloc
alot. I wonder if !node_match triggers too often. We always start with
the per cpu slab, if that one is on the wrong node, you'll always hit
that "another_slab" path.
After searching for way too long (given that I have no clue about that
stuff anyway and just read the code out of curiousness), I noticed that
the the cpu_to_node stuff on x86_64 seems to be initialized to 0xff
(arch/x86/mm/numa_64.c), and Google brought me this dmesg output [1],
which, AFAICT, shows that the per cpu slab setup is done _before_
cpu_to_node is correctly setup. That would lead to the per cpu slabs all
having node == 0xff, which looks pretty bad.
Disclaimer: I read the slub/numa/$WHATEVER_I_SAW_THERE for the first
time, so this might be total bull ;-)
