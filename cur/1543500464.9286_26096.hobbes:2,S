These days, when I once came home, I found my computer ringing
continiously.  I have a cron script that sometimes runs a simple
program, that opens DSP device, writes a 32Kb audio sample (in a single
write operation), does ioctl(audio,SNDCTL_DSP_SYNC,0) and that's it.  I
found the computer play this same sample continiously over and over
again.  It did not respond to keyboard, neither MagicSysRq.  When I hit
reset, it fsck'd without trouble.  Noting in the syslog.  Audio device
is es1370 with native (not ALSA) driver autoloaded as a module.
