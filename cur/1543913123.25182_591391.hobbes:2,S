Oh come on, I thought some small country in maybe central Africa,
but certainly not USA.
What you write would essentially mean GPL (and any other such licence)
is invalid in the USA.
The licence is basically a promise not to sue. It wouldn't make any
sense to promise if you could revoke at will.

Right here grants of rights are some sort of statements of will.

Actually (and I think it's the same in the USA), a copyrighted work
has an implicit "all rights reserved". A licence is just exception.
