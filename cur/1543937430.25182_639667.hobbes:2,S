-	   SLOB replaces the SLAB allocator with a drastically simpler
-	   allocator.  SLOB is more space efficient than SLAB but does not
-	   scale well (single lock for all operations) and is also highly
-	   susceptible to fragmentation. SLUB can accomplish a higher object
-	   density. It is usually better to use SLUB instead of SLOB.
+	   SLOB replaces the stock allocator with a drastically simpler
+	   allocator. SLOB is generally more space efficient but
+	   does not perform as well on large systems.
