So you mean it can work without both the
pm_timer and hpet? Sorry for bothering you
too much, but I am trying to use the hrtimers
in my driver module, so I'd like to know all
the corner-cases.
How can I test that situation when the hrtimers
work only with PIT? Apparently disabling the
pm_timer and hpet in config doesn't help testing
it at all, since it simply refuses to work then.
Should I use hrtimer_get_res() to see if the
hrtimers are available, or is there any better way?
