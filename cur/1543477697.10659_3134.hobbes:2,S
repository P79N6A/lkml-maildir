Wally taught me to be shamelessly buzzword compliant. Hey, we could
use a bit of marketing here. This isn't for comp.os.linux.announce.
There was a GNOME report that seems to have turned multiple language
support (C, C++, Perl, Tom...) into multilingual (French...) support.
Technical press releases must be designed to carry useful info
even after getting mangled by a reporter.
Kylie Smart's version can be used for all the nerdy places.
My version probably made some people _here_ get sick.

Where would it fit? Total length and coherence are concerns.
It is hard to say "no" to such nice content, but...

Save that for slashdot, comp.unix.*, and other nerdy places.
Note the use of "PowerMac" (something people understand) rather 
than "PowerPC" (technical computer innards). Also, Linux can't
even run on a bare CPU. Linux requires a complete computer.

Again, where would it fit? This is also vaporware, in spite of the
certainty. We can't cram the whole Linux FAQ into a press release.
I encourage everyone with decent writing skills to compete a bit
or suggest improvements. Were the features presented in the best
possible order? Was a sesntence easy to misinterpret or hard to parse?
