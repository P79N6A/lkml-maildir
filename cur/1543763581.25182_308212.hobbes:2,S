The x86_64 memset(), both in user space and the kernel, for whatever gcc
I have, and for a current kernel, uses the "repz stos" or "rep stosq"
prefixed instruction for the bulk of the copy.  This combination is a
long running, interruptible Intel string instruction that loops on
itself until the CX register decrements to zero.
Was your windows app using "stos"?
I'll wager a nickel that the actual crash you see comes when the
processor has to handle an interrupt while in the middle of this
instruction.
I'll wager a dime it's hardware, though interrupt activity may be
required to provoke it.
