$ cat /proc/bus/input/devices
On my machine:

Look for lines saying Handlers=kbd eventX
In the same block, you find Phys=<something>
Copy this into xorg.conf, yielding Dev Phys=<something>
The proc/bus/input/devices file tells you about all input devices,
such as keyboards, mice, joysticks...  Take care not trying to
interpret a mouse as a keyboard.. :-)
