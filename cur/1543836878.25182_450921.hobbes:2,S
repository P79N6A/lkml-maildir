Yes - one can botch a file system API.
One can botch syscalls, too.  Do you love 'ioctl'?
For some calls, the performance of a raw syscall is critical.  And
eventually, filesystem API's must resolve to raw file i/o syscalls.
But for these sorts of system configuration and management, the
difference in performance between file system API's and raw syscall
API's is not one of the decisive issues that determines success or
failure.
Getting a decent API that naturally reflects the long term essential
shape of the data is one of these decisive issues.
