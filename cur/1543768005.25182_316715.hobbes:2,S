Solved.

	q) skas/mmu.c is calling pte_alloc_map() without ->page_table_lock.
Trivially fixed, needed if you want spinlock debugging to produce something
useful.
	r) when built static, kernel dies ugly death with

as stack trace.  Buggered offsets in uml.lds, perhaps?
Dynamically built it works; for i386 the same tree works both with both
static and dynamic.  It _might_ be libc difference, in theory (i386 libc
is 2.3.2.ds1-18, amd64 - 2.3.2.ds1-21, both from sarge), but I wouldn't
bet on it.  Anyway, I'm going down right now; carving the fixes into
sane patch series + experimenting with static/amd64 breakage will have
to wait until the morning...
