O.K.  I'm out of my depth here a little.  With what you put forward as pro's
and con's I don't think devfs is a good idea at all.  Not enough reward for
damage done.
Couldn't somebody write a program for /dev that does what linuxconf(and
others) has done for administration.  Just an intelligent interface layer,
not modification to the kernel.
