No interface at all is the best user interface. If there is no
user interface, there's nothing for the user to get intimidated
by, and nothing for the user to screw up.
Why should there be a user interface for allocating resources like
IRQs, I/O port and memory addresses, if there is a mechanism for
doing so automatically? Why bug the user with the mechanical task
of conveying information generated in one place (ISAPNP) to another
place (the driver module parameters)?
Legacy ISA cards are a different matter, of course.
