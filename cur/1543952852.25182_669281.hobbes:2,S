I'm not sure it's unexpected.  It's undesirable, certainly.

I think the guess is faulty.  Could you show ls -l /dev/stdin ?  On my
system, it reports:
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 15 2008-03-10 11:03 /dev/stdin -> /proc/self/fd/0
Wild guess: Users can't access /proc/ directories of executables with the
read-bit clear in order to prevent users from reading the state anyway.
I wonder how effective clearing the read-bit is these days.
Don't we all have source to all the applications anyway?  ;-)
