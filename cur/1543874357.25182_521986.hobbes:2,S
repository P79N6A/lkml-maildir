I tried neverball on my Macbook Pro 1st generation (Core Duo, not Core 2
Duo), and the x axis in inverted, not the y axis.
Could you confirm which axis is inverted on your Macbook?
Also, have you tried the modified hdaps-gl, available here:
http://mactel-linux.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/mactel-linux/trunk/tools/hdaps-gl/
? Is it working correctly?
Thanks,
Best regards,
Nicolas
