Maybe it's not. But that's besides the point. The specific problem Bonwick 
mentioned is related to cache line distribution and should be taken care 
of by slab coloring. Internal fragmentation is painful but the worst 
offenders can be fixed with kmem_cache_alloc(). So I really don't see the 
problem. On the other hand, I am not opposed to dynamic generic slabs if 
you can show a clear performance benefit from it. I just doubt you will.
