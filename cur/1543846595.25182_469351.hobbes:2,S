I can only support Andi here - I disagree that the unwinder is totally
broken, and most code fragments you presented during the thread
to support your statements were actually not even introduced by the
unwinding patches. While you ask Andi to look at the old code, it
seems to me you haven't really looked at the new one.

Rather than ripping out the unwinder, anyone not liking the way it
works or it is implemented can easily just disable it - I always thought
that's what config options are for.

One example of you blaming the unwind code for something that
was all there before. (I agree that I wrote that code, but a lot
earlier, and in order to replace what I could call crap: repeating
the same code sequence three times, making it necessary to apply 
any adjustments to it in three places).
Also, I'd really like to understand if we're on a technical discussion
here, or whether we're just trying to exchange emotions.
