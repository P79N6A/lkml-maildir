Which is pretty much everything you need to retrieve and boot a Linux
kernel ... Obviously, boot manager functionality is lacking here, so
for this, you need to have LILO or such.

I think it's a great idea to have a better execution and development
environment than what I use for LILO (16 bit assembler is a pain).
I'm just sceptical about the code replication issues. Also, it seems
that the good old days of file system heterogenity are coming back
again, so FS-specific code will be tricky (assuming you read file
systems without using the LILO approach of mapping them before use).
Well, I'm busy with other things right now, but I hope to find time
to do some hacking on a "boot next kernel" component in about a month.
Then we'll see if it's a good or a bad idea.
