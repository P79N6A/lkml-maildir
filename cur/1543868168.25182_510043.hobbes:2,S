Where's this coming from?  smp_call_function_single() is an obscure kvm
only API think for x86/ia64 ... it's not supported on any other
architecure.  The symbol you have is blowing up in the kernel
subdirectory which suggests someone has tried to use it in generic code,
which will fail to compile on a lot more than voyager and parisc ...
