This is getting peculiar :) I have a very similar AMD,
processor       : 0
vendor_id       : AuthenticAMD
cpu family      : 5
model           : 8
model name      : AMD-K6(tm) 3D processor
stepping        : 12
cpu MHz         : 400.924185
fdiv_bug        : no
hlt_bug         : no
sep_bug         : no
f00f_bug        : no
fpu             : yes
fpu_exception   : yes
cpuid level     : 1
wp              : yes
flags           : fpu vme de pse tsc msr mce cx8 sep pge mmx 3dnow
bogomips        : 799.54
which i've tried getting mtrr to work on in 2.2.3-ac2 and 2.2.3-ac4. It
oopsed after giving the mtrr message on bootup, trace output showed it was
indeed mtrr that was oopsing. I've sent Alan the oops report a couple of
days ago. But, seeing these messages, i decided to try 2.2.4-ac1 with mtrr,
and, to my amazement, i didn't get an Oops. I also didn't get a message
about mtrr being installed, strangely enough, and as you can see, above,
cpuinfo doesn't say anything about mtrr. I do, however, have /proc/mtrr now. 
So, my gues is:
arch/i386/kernel/setup.c Row ~900:
                /* Modify the capabilities according to chip type */
                if (c->x86_vendor == X86_VENDOR_CYRIX) {
                        x86_cap_flags[24] = "cxmmx";
                } else if (c->x86_vendor == X86_VENDOR_AMD) {
                        x86_cap_flags[16] = "fcmov";
                        x86_cap_flags[31] = "3dnow";
                        if (c->x86 == 5 && c->x86_model == 6)
                                x86_cap_flags[10] = "sep";
                } else if (c->x86_vendor == X86_VENDOR_INTEL) {
                        x86_cap_flags[6] = "pae";
                        x86_cap_flags[9] = "apic";
                        x86_cap_flags[12] = "mtrr";
                        x86_cap_flags[14] = "mca";
                        x86_cap_flags[16] = "pat";
                        x86_cap_flags[17] = "pse36";
                        x86_cap_flags[18] = "psn";
                        x86_cap_flags[24] = "osfxsr";
                }
You wont ever see mtrr in the cpuflags for a non-intel processor :) It works
now, though. I might run some benchmarks if i find some time, this weekend.
Regardless, Matthew, you should have /proc/mtrr on 2.2.4-ac1. I can send
along my .config to see if anything significant is different ?
