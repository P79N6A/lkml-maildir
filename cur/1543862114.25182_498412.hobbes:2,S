For NFS, the main feature of interest when it comes to O_DIRECT is
strictly uncached I/O. Replacing it with POSIX_FADV_NOREUSE won't help
because it can't guarantee that the page will be thrown out of the page
cache before some second process tries to read it. That is particularly
true if some dopey third party process has mmapped the file.
