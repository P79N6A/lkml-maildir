Everything gets bad when it doesn't work for you. :-)

I have noted that some ports may [ever] require pci_alloc_consistent not
to be called from interrupt context. Just I will look into this when time
will allow.
Btw, I thought long ago about using a thread in the driver to deal with
completions and some other events on which the driver may want to allocate
memory. But this would have added useless latency. Instead I preferred to
be careful about the driver to be as fast as possible when completing an
IO under interrupt.
Btw-bis, FreeBSD-5 wants to thread everything (as most of you know). We
will see the result... No need to say that I posted my disagreement when
this project started. As FreeBSD-5 should be ready when Linux-2.6 will be,
we will be able to compare interrupt threading cost against simple fast
interrupt on typical hardware (99% are UP in my guessing).

ARM arch is simplistic. Wanting to run modern O/Ses on this crap looks
utter stupidity to me. I don't care about ARM at all.

I am not going to ever use not cache coherent hardware, even if I am ready
to make the sym driver work reliably on such brain-dead things. Just it is
not high priority stuff for now.
