Thank you Gert. I turned off Winbond support as before and it truly is
"safe to say no" now. Your patch seems to work. Good Job.
Still outstanding:
If (mode=SPP && Zip100) Log_msg("Spp is godawful slow, set for EPP in
bios");
// I don't know off top of my head if Zip250 can use ECP or not
// Zip100 is EPP at best
Imm driver reports Zip100 at 101 MB
ECP/EPP setting in Bios yields SPP for Zip100. 1284 spec says you should
be able to set mode 100 to get EPP and even tho it's a M$ extension most
chipsets should support it.
Speed Sucks: Hdparm reports 496k/sec for EPP on a 64 MB buffered disk
read. 1284 spec says 500k/2 MB for EPP and Iomega says it can do 1.4 MB
sustained for Zip100. Not that it matters but SPP runs 96k/sec.
I'm coding up a parport-poker to get familiar then I'll take a stab at
these if someone doesn't beat me to it.
