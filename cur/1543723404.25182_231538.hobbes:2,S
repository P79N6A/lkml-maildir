Thanks for testing, Kyle.
It looks fine, although this is wrong:

The error code is -1, aka. MAP_FAILED.

That's a surprisingly low address.

Phew, I'm glad I decided to catch SIGBUS in the test program at the
last moment...
That's a historical BSD-ism.  They can't change it now, because
programs do trap and check for SIGBUS on that platform for protection
violations.

It might be a generic *BSD bug (for whatever value of * is used by MacOS X).
That would be interesting to know -- anyone here running *BSD on PPC
or any other architecture to test?
Of course it's an Apple bug as well :)
