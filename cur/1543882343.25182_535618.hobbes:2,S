Ah, now I get what you want.
You only get this information from MAINTAINERS plus knowledge who 
recently touched which code (git helps with the latter).
The problem with such a database would be the same as with the 
MAINTAINERS file: The information becomes outdated, and someone has to 
maintain it.
Sending a patch against MAINTAINERS is easy - I don't see a 
WWW-browseable database being in any respect better than the 
MAINTAINERS file.
