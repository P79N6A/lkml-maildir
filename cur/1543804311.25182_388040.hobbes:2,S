Linus, please pull from:

This tree contains the following change:
    Move ip2.c and ip2main.c to drivers/char/ip2/ where the other files
    used by this driver reside.
    Renamed ip2.c to ip2base.c to allow ip2.o to be built from multiple
    objects.

The diffstat is big, but changes are actually only:
- move ip2.c and ip2main.c to drivers/char/ip2/
- rename ip2.c to ip2base.c (the module is still called ip2)
- adjust some #include's in the moved files to the new location
Further cleanup patches will go the usual way through Michael/Andrew, 
but this straightforward moving of files should be done through git.
