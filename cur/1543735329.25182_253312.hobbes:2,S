I have had problems with the multitech 4 port serial card under both
the 2.4 and the 2.6 Linux kernels.
I guess the most important problem is that the driver module does not
detect the card at all -- the only driver whichworks is the one from
multitech itself.   Here is the lspci -v entry for the card.
0000:00:0e.0 Serial controller: Exar Corp. XR17C158 Octal UART (rev
01) (prog-if 02 [16550])
        Subsystem: Unknown device 2205:2001
        Flags: fast devsel, IRQ 7
        Memory at fba00000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=2K]
 
Now also, I have an Asus a8V and if I have the apic support for uni
processors on it won't even boot with the card installed.
Any assistance on these matters would be appreciated -- especially
