Hmm.  There do seem to be a lot of loopholes/race conditions where the
barrier just won't work right in the face of error recovery.  I wouldn't
want to use barriers on any system where data integrity was crucial.
For example, in Fibrechannel using class 3 (the usual)
	send command (command frame corrupted; device does not receive)
	send barrier (completes normally)
	... (lots of time goes by, many more commands are processed)
	timeout original command whose command frame was corrupted
The only safe way to run such a filesystem is to hold the barriers in
the driver until all previous commands are successfully completed.
There was also the problem of the queue full to the barrier command,
etc.
Did I miss the answer to these?  I don't recall seeing an answer to
Patrick Mansfield's questions either (original message edited cutting
out a couple of paragraphs):
