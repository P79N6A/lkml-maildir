Yes they should, this was just a quick list. Feel free to help writing a better 
list. And I guess we should put this list in the wiki somewhere.

I think this is best answered by Jean and/or Mark

Erm, if  someone doesn't know what this means / how to look for this he 
shouldn't be reviewing a driver.

The etc. was because I'm sure there are more but I couldn't come up with any 
right there and then. And again a newbie shouldn't be reviewing, he should 
start reading some book in device drivers writing a driver or two himself get 
those reviewed and then he should no longer be a newbie :)

Yes ofcourse authors should follow the guidelines, and check they did 
themselves before submitting. Also its great that there are volunteers, but 
reviewing does require a certain level of competence. There are many other ways 
to help out for those without the necessary skills todo the reviewing.
For example you could check out the 3.0.0 branch:
svn checkout 
http://lm-sensors.org/svn/lm-sensors/branches/lm-sensors-3.0.0
Edit lib/chips.c, goto the long array at the end and comment any entries for 
chips you have. Optionally edit prog/sensors/main.c goto the array near the end 
and again comment entries for chips you have.
Build and install lm-sensors-3.0.0 and let us know how it works, despite the 
commenting it should still recognize your cips and print the same info as usual 
(it can now dynamicly recognize new/unknown chips as long as the kernel 
supports them). When you skipped the optional step run the sensors command as 
'sensors -g', the normal sensors command will be borked if you skipped this step.
Thanks & Regards,
Hans
