When I used pci=biosirq, this is what I got:

It's a BIOS problem.  Linux is capable of retreiving the pirq table using BIOS 
calls, but the table the BIOS returns does not have entries for the Cardbus 
bridge.  I think I might be out of luck.  Lemme go do some research, and see what 
I can dig up.
