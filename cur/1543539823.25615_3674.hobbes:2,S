Sorry, wasn't looking hard enough; just spotted si_addr under sigaction.
Great!

> Does anyone know if the faulting address related to a SIGSEGV is available? I want to mprotect(PROT_READ) mmap()'ed pages and intercept this signal, record the address and change the protection to allow continuation. The reason I ask here is I don't believe such info is available through a system call and am wondering whether it can be made so via a kernel mod; maybe even the kernel cannot know?
Any suggestions appreciated.
Thanks,
Chris Quinn
