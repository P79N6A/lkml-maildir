Subject: [PATCH 7/9] uml: arch Kconfig menu cleanups
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/1/17/392

*) mark as "EXPERIMENTAL" various items that either aren't very stable or that
are actively crashing the setup of users which don't really need them (i.e.
HIGHMEM and 3-level pagetables on x86 - nobody needs either, everybody reports
"I'm using it and getting trouble").
*) move net/Kconfig near to the rest of network configurations, and
drivers/block/Kconfig near "Block layer" submenu.
*) it's useless and doesn't work well to force NETDEVICES on and to disable the
prompt like it's done. Better remove the attempt, and change that to a simple
"default y if UML".
*) drop the warning about "report problems about HPPFS" - it's redundant
anyway, as that's the usual procedure, and HPPFS users are especially technical
(i.e. they know reporting bugs is _good_).
