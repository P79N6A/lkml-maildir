That is actually my point. If you're checking for errors you will end up
first doing [2] and later on doing something like [1] anyway...

From the proposal:

<snip>
So you just need to pass a large enough bitmask with all ones and the kernel
will put zeroes in the bitmask up to the bit number NR_sycalls - 1.
Counting the zeroes should work...
