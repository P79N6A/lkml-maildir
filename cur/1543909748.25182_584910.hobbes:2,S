And I'm trying to tell you that unless you have some magic new  
algorithm that turns NP-complete problems into O(log(N)) problems,  
your idea won't work.  You can't just say "I just do one little thing  
(mv) and the entire rest of the computer automagically changes to  
match", because that would imply a single unscalable global kernel  
lock.  "Pattern"-matching is either NP-complete or high-polynomial- 
order, depending on how its implemented, and if you want to do a  
recursive-chmod during a directory move then you're going to have  
race-conditions out the ass.  If you have code or solid math to back  
up your postings then please do so, but otherwise you're just wasting  
time and bandwidth.
Cheers,
