Correct - or the unrelated worklet might also be blocked on something - so 
the window is rather large.

well, we call this on any arbitrary CPU:
   long work_on_cpu(unsigned int cpu, long (*fn)(void *), void *arg)
To execute fn() on 'cpu'. We converted wacky callers that did direct 
p->cpus_allowed twiddling (and on-stack saving) and set_cpus_allowed() 
calls to this elegant-looking work_on_cpu() call which just promised 
exactly this functionality but cleanly so.
