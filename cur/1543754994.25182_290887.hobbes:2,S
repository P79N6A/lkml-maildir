hmmmmmm.  Maybe "!= PCI_CLASS_STORAGE_IDE" instead?
Overall, however, I am worried about your report of the driver's 
behavior based on that BIOS's configuration.  The driver follows the PCI 
IDE standard (previously SFF 8038i), where a register indicates whether 
its in legacy or native mode.  As it see it, either
a) the driver logic for reading that register is wrong, or
b) BIOS incorrectly configuring the device, or
c) that register is only applicable for PCI_CLASS_STORAGE_IDE devices.
Comments either way?
