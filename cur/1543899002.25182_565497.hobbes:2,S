Subject: [patch 0/3] clean gendisk out of scsi ULD structs
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Since gendisk will now become part of struct scsi_device, we don't need
to store this value in any private data structs where they already store
scsi_device.  This series cleans up a few drivers which did this.
