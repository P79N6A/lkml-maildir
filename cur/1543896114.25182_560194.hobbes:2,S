Well, if we're going to have super-secret hidden directories, we might as well 
implement them in a namespace framework.  Somebody is going to want generic 
filesystem namespaces eventually, so having one unified mechanism for doing this 
kind of thing will make it much easier, especially for userspace apps which 
would need to be modified to be aware of them.
Personally, I'm happy with .snapshot and the like.
