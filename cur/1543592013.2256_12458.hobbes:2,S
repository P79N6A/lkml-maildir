Note that this is still fundamentally a broken interface: the filesystem
may not _have_ a block device underneath it, yet you might very well like
to do defragmentation and backup none-the-less.
Also, lvm snapshots are fundamentally limited to read-only data, which
means that the LVM interfaces cannot be used for defragmentation and lazy
fsck etc anyway. You _have_ to do those at a filesystem level.
disk snapshots are useful, but they are not the answer.
