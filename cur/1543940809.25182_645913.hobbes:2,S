thanks a ton - this produced a link error here too.
after half an hour of head scratching, the updated patch below solves 
the build problem.
The problem i believe is this code in arch/ia64/kernel/mca_asm.S:
#define GET_IA64_MCA_DATA(reg)                                          \
        GET_THIS_PADDR(reg, ia64_mca_data)                              \
        ;;                                                              \
        ld8 reg=[reg]
this i believe builds an implicit dependency between the mca_asm.o 
position within the image and the ia64_mca_data percpu variable it 
accesses - it relies on the immediate 22 addressing mode that has 4MB of 
scope. Per chance, the .config you sent creates a 14MB image, and the 
percpu variables moved too far away for the linker to be able to fulfill 
this constraint.
The workaround is to define PER_CPU_ATTRIBUTES to link percpu variables 
back into the .percpu section on UP too - which ia64 links specially 
into its vmlinux.lds. But ultimately i think the better solution would 
be to remove this dependency between arch/ia64/kernel/mca_asm.S and the 
position of the percpu data.
Is my analysis correct? Do you like my fix and does the patch build and 
boot on your system? Thanks,
	Ingo

Subject: ia64: on UP percpu variables are not small memory model
From: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
Tony says:
| The CONFIG_SMP=n path in ia64 makes quite radical changes ... rather
| than putting all the per-cpu stuff into the top 64K of address space
| and providing a per-cpu TLB mapping for that range to a different
| physical address ... it just makes all the per-cpu stuff link as ordinary
| variables in .data.
the new generic percpu code got confused about this as PER_CPU_ATTRIBUTES
was defined even on UP, so it picked up that small memory model - which
was not possible to get linked. The right fix is to only define that
on SMP. This resolved the build failures in my cross-compiling environment.
also link these variables into the .percpu section - some assembly code 
has offset dependencies.
