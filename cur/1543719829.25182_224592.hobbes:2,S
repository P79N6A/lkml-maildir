You get it wrong.  This is mainly about Bad Code or Insufficient
Documentation.  In general, I want recursions to be removed, full
stop.  So there is not more data, but less.
If the recursion is actually wanted, then those cases should either be
so few and obvious that a single person can explain them all from
memory.  That, or things have to be written down somehow and unless
you have a better suggestion, any format is better than nothing.
