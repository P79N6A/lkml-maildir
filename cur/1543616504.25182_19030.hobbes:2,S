You still are changing a few dbg() macros that you don't have to change.
Also, info(), warn() and err() should not have __FUNCTION__ added to
them.  Have you tried running the usb code with this patch?  The USB
group gets enough grief about all of the kernel log messages that we
spit out.  We do not need to see the function name for every message we
write (the user does not need it.)
I think I'll wait for the debug level messages cleanup in the 2.5 USB
code to make this kind of change (as talked about in a previous
message.)
thanks,
