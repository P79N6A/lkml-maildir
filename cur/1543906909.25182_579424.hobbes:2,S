Oh dear.
Why not just make ext3 fsync() a no-op while you're at it?
Distros can turn it back on if it's needed...
Of course I'm not serious, but like atime, fsync() is something one
expects to work if it's there.  Disabling atime updates or making
fsync() a no-op will both result in silent failure which I am sure we
can agree is disasterous.
Why on earth would you cripple the kernel defaults for ext3 (which is a
fine FS for boot/root filesystems), when the *fundamental* problem you
really want to solve lie much deeper in the implementation of the
filesystem?  Noatime doesn't solve the problem, it just makes it "less
horrible".
If you really need different filesystem performance characteristics, you
can switch to another filesystem. There's plenty to choose from.
