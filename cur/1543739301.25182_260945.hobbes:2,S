I have gotten a couple of interesting traces on my dual 2.6G Xeon 
workstation here at the office. These were both generated running tests 
on (oddly enough) my own trace buffer that I am working on for a client 
here. The test basically consists of 100 threads putting data into the 
trace buffer concurrently and then one reader thread draining it and 
populating a multi-dimensional array to make sure all of the data is 
accounted for and not corrupted. All threads are running at a normal 
priority since the test is for correctness not performance. The traces 
are here:
