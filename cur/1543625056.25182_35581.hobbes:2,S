The clobber list is _extra_ clobbers, registers or memory that gcc
cannot deduce from the other parameters.  =d" (xloops), "=&a" (d0)
already tells gcc that edx and eax are used, you do not need to
explicitly specify them as clobbers.  OTOH, asm ("mov 1, %eax")
requires a clobber because the operands do not mention eax.
