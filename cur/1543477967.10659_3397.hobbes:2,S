Thanks to you and Max for pointing this out to me.
This being the case, then rather than patching the kernel to say "210ms
timeslices" (it's ~201ms on Alpha anyway) we should simply do  "if
(p->counter <= 0)" instead (and change the SMP case to be "if
(p->counter > 0)" instead of ">= 0"), then we have 200ms timeslices.
This isn't purely cosmetic: 5% IS a little better as minimum CPU usage
than 9%, let's face it.
