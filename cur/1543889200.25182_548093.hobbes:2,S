No, it won't help. The 1M range (ff500000-ff5fffff) is more than enough.
The reason why the D-Link resource is not getting assigned is rather
interesting: as Wayne wrote

which means that the device class is 0 (not defined).
And in drivers/pci/setup-bus.c we have
		/* Don't touch classless devices or host bridges or ioapics.  */
		if (class == PCI_CLASS_NOT_DEFINED ||
		    class == PCI_CLASS_BRIDGE_HOST)
			continue;
The short term fix would be to assign proper device class to D-Link NIC
using pci quirk, but I believe a proper solution is to remove all sorts of
"if (class == PCI_xxx)" limitations (alpha, for example needs none of them)
from generic code and mark critical stuff with IORESOURCE_PCI_FIXED
in arch-specific way...
Ivan.
