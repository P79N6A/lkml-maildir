I'm afraid I'm not familiar with Linux' SLIP implementation.
So there's a line discipline called "slip" which, when pushed
onto a serial port, registers as a network device, right? How
does it get - and stay - pushed? Is there a daemon process which
opens the serial port, pushes the line discipline onto it, and
then just sleeps, keeping the serial port open so that the line
discipline stays put? Can you point me to the source for such a
daemon for reference?
What I am actually looking for is a way to port an existing driver
which directly programs an i8250 serial port, to cooperate more
cleanly with the existing serial port drivers of Linux (and, at
the same time, shed the dependency on the specific serial port
hardware.) If that requires a permanently running (or sleeping)
userspace daemon, then so be it. (Although I admit I'd rather do
without.)
Thanks
Tilman
