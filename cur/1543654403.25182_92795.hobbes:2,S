I Hate when this happens... now with the pacth attached...
Hello....
This patch fixes this redefines in linux-2.5.49 and 2.5.50 ...
In file included from fs/xfs/linux/xfs_linux.h:56,
                 from fs/xfs/xfs.h:54,
                 from fs/xfs/xfs_acl.c:33:
fs/xfs/linux/xfs_vnode.h:546: warning: `AT_UID' redefined
include/linux/elf.h:172: warning: this is the location of the previous definition
fs/xfs/linux/xfs_vnode.h:547: warning: `AT_GID' redefined
include/linux/elf.h:174: warning: this is the location of the previous definition
....
This happens, because linux/module.h is including linux/elf.h that define AT_UID and AT_GID (since 2.5.49) ...
i just renamed the XFS Attributes defines from AT_XXX to XFS_AT_XXX
best regards.
