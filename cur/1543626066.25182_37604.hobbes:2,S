Yes. Slab objects can be initialised once when a new page is added to the 
slab, and returned to the slab in reusable form so that you don't have the
cost of complete initialisation on each allocation.
So if for example you have a semaphore in your slab object, instead of
initialising it on each kmem_cache_alloc() you do it once when the new pages
are added to the slab. Then you just make sure it's unlocked each time you
free a slab object.
