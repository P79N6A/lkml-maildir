Yeah, I need semaphore. This is a hw register that says when the hw
is ready to accept a new command. Code that wants to send commands has
to down the semaphore and then send it. When hw is ready to get a new
command, it sends and IRQ and the IRQ up()s the semaphore. 
Now, we don't want to hang on that down() forever if the hw spaces out.
If we get a timeout, we can try recovery actions (like resetting it,
for sake of being polite). 
I use this in the WHCI Ultra Wide Band radio controller code (coming soon
to a hw store near you).
Cristoph, I still wonder how the hell you do it to spot every message
that comes into lkml -- I bet you have a cluster of employees using your
name doing it... :)
