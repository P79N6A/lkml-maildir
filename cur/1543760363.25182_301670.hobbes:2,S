If I boot on a working system it is 8,5
mkrootdev is a nash command
       mkrootdev path
              Makes path a block inode for the device which should be mounted
              as  root.  To  determine  this device nash uses the device sug-
              gested by the root= kernel command line argument (if root=LABEL
              is  used devices are probed to find one with that label). If no
              root=  argument  is  available,  /proc/sys/kernel/real-root-dev
              provides the device number.
I already tried switching from the label syntax to /dev/sda5 without effect.
