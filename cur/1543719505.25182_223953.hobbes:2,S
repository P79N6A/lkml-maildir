I don't use my CD-ROM drive too often, and in fact I think the last time I
did was 4 April, to make a backup; at the time I was running 2.6.4, patched
with supermount and bootsplash.  Now I run 2.6.5, and I find the following
odd situation in /dev:
# ls -l /dev/hd*
brw-rw-rw-    1 root     root       3,   0 May 13 07:18 /dev/hda
brw-rw-rw-    1 root     root       3,   1 May 13 07:18 /dev/hda1
brw-rw-rw-    1 root     root       3,  64 May 13 07:18 /dev/hdb
brw-rw-rw-    1 root     root       3,  65 May 13 07:18 /dev/hdb1
brw-rw-rw-    1 root     root       3,  66 May 13 07:18 /dev/hdb2
brw-rw-rw-    1 root     root       3,  69 May 13 07:18 /dev/hdb5
brw-rw-rw-    1 root     root       3,  70 May 13 07:18 /dev/hdb6
brw-rw-rw-    1 root     root       3,  71 May 13 07:18 /dev/hdb7
brw-rw-rw-    1 root     root       3,  72 May 13 07:18 /dev/hdb8
crw-rw-rw-    1 root     root      22,   0 May 30 15:41 /dev/hdc
It's probably not just me that hdc (my CD-ROM) should be a block device.  I
use udev to manage /dev but I haven't touched a line of any script in months;
deleting and recreating the device with udev reproduces the problem.  If I
manually create /dev/hdc with `mknod -m 666 /dev/hdc b 22 0` I can read the
disc in the drive.  The directory /sys/block/hdc exists and contains a
device, but for some reason udev makes a char device anyway.
No other block device has this problem (i.e. I have been able to boot my
computer from a hard disk); what's going on here?
