But offlining all the cpus in a node is already something that just
works.  If the user is all that concerned about not thrashing the
tasks running on that node, they would have a workload manager that
migrates the tasks off the node before shooting down cpus.  Similar
argument applies to interrupt affinity.
I really haven't seen a compelling argument for why this is needed,
just a bunch of handwaving so far, sorry.
