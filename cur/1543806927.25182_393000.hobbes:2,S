You're far from the only one.  There is currently a real fad into
putting as many things as possible (or not) in userspace without
seemingly thinking about things like security, long term
maintainability, usability or even compatiblity between kernel
versions and userspace versions.

I don't actually advocate suspend2.  I indeed have not looked at the
patches at that point.  I do find it extremely annoying that instead
of trying to make what exists reliable, for instance what are the
rules irq grabbing/release at that point, and adding infrastructure
for what's missing for having real reliability, f.i. communication
with fb/drm to handle the screen power switch, you decide to go and
move things into userspace which is going to increase the reliability
problems immensely.  I don't even want to think about the interactions
between freezing the userspace memory pages and running some processes
which may malloc/mmap at the same time.
