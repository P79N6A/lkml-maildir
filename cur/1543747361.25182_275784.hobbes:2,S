Hi,
I use the signatures on the kernel releases to verify all files that I
download. 
But..... whats with the following  files ?
patch-2.6.X.sign 
linux-2.6.X.sign
What do they sign ?
I _do_ understand the following types:
patch-2.6.X.tar.gz.sign is the signature of:
patch-2.6.X.tar.gz
patch.2.6.X.tar.bz2.sign is the signature of:
patch.2.6.X.tar.bz2
I suspect this is some kind of FAQ but I couldn't find it.
Regards,
Harm
