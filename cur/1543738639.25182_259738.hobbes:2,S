Hi,
It seems that on 2.6.9-rc4-mm1 swsusp is unable to free memory on my AMD64 
box:
Stopping tasks: 
========================================================================|
Freeing memory...  done (0 pages freed)
PM: Attempting to suspend to disk.
PM: snapshotting memory.
swsusp: critical section:
..<7>[nosave pfn 
0x5b1]...............................................................................................................
....swsusp: Need to copy 114733 pages
suspend: (pages needed: 114733 + 512 free: 16146)
swsusp: Not enough free pages: Have 16146
On 2.6.9-rc4, for the same set of apps started (after fresh boot), I get:
Stopping tasks: 
==========================================================================|
Freeing 
memory: ......................................................................................................................

Losing some ticks... checking if CPU frequency changed.
PM: Attempting to suspend to disk.
PM: snapshotting memory.
swsusp: critical section:
..<7>[nosave pfn 
0x58d]..........................................................................................swsusp: 
Need to copy
45510 pages
suspend: (pages needed: 45510 + 512 free: 85369)
On 2.6.9-rc3-mm3 it was OK.
Greets,
