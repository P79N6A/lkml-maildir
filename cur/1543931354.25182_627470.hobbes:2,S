Hm, we just want to be able to get to the kobject somehow here.  Not
create a new api that doesn't match up.  I'll think about it and figure
something that matches the other portions of the api.

As devices _should_ always be dynamic, hopefully I'll not have to do
that.  But knowing some of the platform devices, I'm afraid I'll have to
do that split :)
