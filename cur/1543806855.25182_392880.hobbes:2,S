Because it's a really bad idea? Right now we have a few storage drivers
that don't use SCSI, that number will increase in the future.
The fact that lots of drivers use the SCSI stack even if they didn't
have to is mainly because the SCSI layer had all those handy features
that they all needed. During 2.5 and 2.6 we moved a lot of that
functionality transparently to the block layer instead. As we complete
that work, it would be just as easy to write a native block driver
instead of a SCSI LLD. libata is one such example.
