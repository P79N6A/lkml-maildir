Ah. But ktime_get shouldn't printk. Or did you change that?

Just use jiffies directly in printk. That's only HZ accurate, but should
be good enough for printk.  
One could use pure monotonic xtime as fallback instead of ktime_get in sched_clock. 
The trouble is  just that they might cause sched_clock to go backwards during 
a temporary instability period (cpufreq change) because the xtime will be 
always a bit behind the TSC and a TSC->xtime conversion will lose time.
At least the scheduler doesn't handle backwards time warp on a CPU gratefully.
Ok I guess it could  return max(last_value_before_instability, xtime)
