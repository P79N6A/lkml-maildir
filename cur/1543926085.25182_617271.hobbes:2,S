By doing so you've just said (implicitly) that you can not tolerate
someone having a different opinion from your own.
While I accept *your* right to run *your* lists how you please, you
are unable to accept *my* right to run *my* lists how I see fit.
Time will tell which lists will survive.  Whatever, I suspect that by
doing what you've just done, you're going to create more confusion and
problems. Instead of having one focused place for discussions and bug
reports, they're going to be spread more thinly, meaning less people
looking at such things, meaning more bugs get ignored.  Thus making
the issue worse.
So, when are you creating a replacement alsa-devel mailing list on
vger?  That's also subscribers-only.
