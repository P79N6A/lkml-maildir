Hello linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org ! 
I found your e-mail in search result in Internet. And I decided to write you and introduce myself. So, my name is Larisa.

If you really searching for your second half with serious intentions to build a family, if you prefer present dialogue instead of game, I'll wait for yoUr ansWer.
