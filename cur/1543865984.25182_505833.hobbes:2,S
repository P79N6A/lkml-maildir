Well, code and facts will tell. :o)
Since you asked for questions:
- will the ~7k limit for the jumbo frames be fixed ? One can hardly call
  it a feature.
- out of curiosity, did you try the current in-kernel r8169 driver with
  a 8111B or a 8101E ?
- is there any plan to open the programming manuals of the PCI-E chipsets ?
