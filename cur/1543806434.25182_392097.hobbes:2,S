Dominik has made quite widespread changes to these drivers - enough that
I'm not confident to fix the rejects, make it compile and hope that it
still works.
So can you please sort things out with Dominik?  I guess a tested patch
against -mm4 would be ideal.
I note that these drivers forget to check for pcmcia_register_driver()
failure.  That's a fairly good way of getting an oops in rmmod.
