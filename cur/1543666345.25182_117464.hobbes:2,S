Kernel versions 2.5.61-64 (Havnt tried 60) produce stuttering sound when 
using alsa and mmap (xmms alsa output plugin) or oss emu and mmap (quake3?) 
produce stuttering sound happening after around the first half second of 
playing. This is with the kernels alsa cs46xx module and a Turtle beach 
Santa Cruz soundcard. Works fine with 2.5.59 though.
