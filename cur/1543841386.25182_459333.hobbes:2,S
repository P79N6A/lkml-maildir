when I said "driver" I meant more along the line of SCSI hardware
instead of things that use the "Linux" scsi subsystem.  i.e. usb, sata
are not scsi hardware even though they use the scsi subsystem.
Or to put it another way, perhaps no "select"able option should ever be
visibly selectable in XYZconfig.  And XYZconfig should only show an
option that is "select"able if by selecting it one ends up with a
consistent configuration.
So you have a "virtual" SCSI_SUBSYSTEM which usb-storage, sbp2, sata all
pull in by selecting it.
you have SCSI_HARDWARE that adaptec, buslogic, lsilogic...... depend on.
SCSI_HARDWARE would also select "SCSI_SUBSYSTEM".
