Subject: Current git fails to compile on AMD64 for three days in a row

I just pulled the current git (de5603748af8bf7deac403e6ba92887f8d18e812)
and tried to compile it on my AMD64 box, to test Chuck's RPC fix.  It
fails:
   arch/x86_64/kernel/head64.c: In function ‘x86_64_start_kernel’:
   arch/x86_64/kernel/head64.c:70: error: size of array ‘type name’ is negative
It is failing in the same way since Monday.
