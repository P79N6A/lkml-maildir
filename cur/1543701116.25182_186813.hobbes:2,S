I don't think there's anything special about use_tsc for NUMA-Q - it's
set to 1 AFAICS. I had a patch to force notsc on about 6 months or so
ago, but it made the machine crash hard in strange ways I never bothered
debugging. 
Is there any harm in dropping the first part of your patch, ie.

and leaving the rest of it? the CONFIG_NUMA affects both NUMA-Q and Summit,
BTW, which uses the cyclone timer, so it gets even more complex ;-)
