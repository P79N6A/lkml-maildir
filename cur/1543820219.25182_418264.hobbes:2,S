Subject: [PATCH] cifs experimental off leads to compile errors

As of 2.6.17-rc2-git5 it seems that CIFS has stopped working
if CIFS_EXPERIMENTAL isn't enabled .  The following sorts
out the errors, but I am not sure if the semantics of the
experimEnabled_write() are correct when CIFS_EXPERIMENTAL is
disabled.

cifs experimental off leads to compile errors
When compiling with CIFS enabled but with CIFS_EXPERIMENTAL disabled
you get link errors as below.
  fs/built-in.o(.text+0x11bf8c): In function `.cifs_setup_session':
  : undefined reference to `.CIFS_SessSetup'
It seems that we need to help the optimiser out more when disabling
this code.  This patch turns the experimEnabled variable into the
constant (0) when experimental support is not compiled in.
