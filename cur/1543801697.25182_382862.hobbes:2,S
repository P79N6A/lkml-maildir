Well, why not putting this into include/linux/compiler.h instead ? It
would shout earlier and will be easier to find.

I would even explicitly state that gcc-3.3 and 3.4 should work in most
cases, while gcc 4 will definitely not work. It's important IMHO to
give the answers that most users will be looking for, and 3.3/3.4 are
fairly common.

Same here.
