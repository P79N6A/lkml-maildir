autoconf code already exists for this, it's a non-problem. Note they must use
the config in the header file of the vendor-provided kernel source tree, not
/boot/config-`uname -r`
There are two cases:
1) the vendor source tree is installed and set up with the right config -> use header file
2) it's installed and the config has changed. -> use header file
I don't see a point in ever looking at /boot/config-`uname -r` instead of
the source tree, given that we must compile against a tree configured like the
eventual running kernel anyway.
