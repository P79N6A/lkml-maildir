I was trying to avoid building a scatterlist completely.  There's not much
point because the scatterlist approach involves finding out the page struct and
then kmapping it just so that the FCrypt algorithm can read 8 or 16 bytes of
data from kernel space.  Why do that if we can avoid it?  It's a waste of
processing time, and has to be done on every secure packet.

FCrypt is only available in software as far as I know.  For producing and
checking packet signatures, using hardware support would be a waste of time as
the size of the crunched data is so small (a single 8-byte fragment per
packet).

RxRPC has security features, up to and including full packet content encryption
if you select it.

It's not really odd.  The "static" and "inline" don't actually add anything to
the function template.  They're merely scope limiters / optimisation
controllers, and so make a lot of sense placed on their own line.
