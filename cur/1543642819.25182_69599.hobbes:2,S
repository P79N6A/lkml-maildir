OH! That'd be nice: instead of a lockup if a PCI device's interrupt
isn't serviced, you get a nice message and a machine that might
still work!
On the other hand, you have a possibility for disaster if the 
threshold isn't set right. 
I have written serial drivers where the card will limit the interrupt
rate to max 100 per second. I then build in a detection: if my IRQ 
handler gets called more than 10 times in a jiffy, we're in trouble.
Turns out that I left this in "in the field" and some people put the
serial card on the same interrupt line as a SCSI controller. The
scsi controller can generate more than 1000 interrupts per second ->
my driver shuts down.... 
Something similar may happen if say you net-spray a sligtly 
under-powered machine with a Gigabit ethernet card: The GBE card may
indeed have a new packet ready by the time the interrupt tries to 
return. Leads to an interesting DOS: just send a bunch of packets
in quick succession and the machine drops off the internet...
