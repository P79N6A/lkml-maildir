Hi,
the gitweb running on git(2).kernel.org has looked buggy to me for quite a 
some time (a month or so) with respect to branches vs. shortlog.
When you browse a repository with mutliple branches, and switch between 
branches, the shortlog shown is always the one from master, never from the 
branch you switched to, which seems wrong to me.
This definitely worked previously (and works on other installations of 
gitweb outside the kernel.org), so it might be worth fixing.
Thanks,
