Hi Ingo, hi Avi, hi all,
I'm trying to use kvm-20 with cfs v4 and get a crash:
eworm@revo:~$ /usr/local/kvm/bin/qemu -snapshot /mnt/data/virtual/qemu/winxp.img
kvm_run: failed entry, reason 7
kvm_run returned -8
It works (though it is a bit slow) if I start qemu with strace, so for me it 
looks like a race condition?
I did not test any earlier versions of cfs and kvm in combination - I can't 
say if it happens there as well.
