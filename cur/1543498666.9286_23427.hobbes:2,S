Hi there,
after some discussion and trouble shooting together with Stephen I still
cannot get his latest raw device version up and running together with either
Oracle8 or Sybase 11.
I _did_ check raw dev permissions, checked everthing else, Stephen checked a
strace which looks fine as well (attached).
Is there anybody who got that to work??? Please reply then. Thanx.
Marcus
