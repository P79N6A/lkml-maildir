Hi,
I just wondered if the below type of crash was a known thing, and if
there are any obvious things I can do to prevent/fix it ?
BUG: spinlock bad magic on CPU#0, kswapd0/242 (Not tainted)
lock: c06c9380, .magic: c06c9380, .owner:

=======================
The .owner: field contains a long list of unprintable characters.
The server is running kernel-smp-2.6.20-1.2307.fc5.i686.rpm.
Hardware of note is:
1x AMD AM2 DUALCORE 3800
2x Corsair DDR2 XMS 1Gb PC6400
2x 400G SEAGATE SATA2 ST3400633AS (traditional s/w RAID1 w/ ext3)
1x ASUS M2V-MX AM2 MOBO (onboard NIC unused)
1x e100 driver using NIC
I've a few things to try (disabling serial/par ports, unused NIC, USB).
It also crashed with a UP kernel.
Apologies if I'm duplicating any questions asked, I Googled for the
error messages but found quite different stack traces and contextx
(e.g. resiferfs vs ext3 - i'm only running ext3)
Regards,
Ian

server is crashed!)
