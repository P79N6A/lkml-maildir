If NAPI disables interrupts and keeps them disabled while there are more 
packets arriving or more transmits being completed, why do hardware 
interrupt mitigation / coalescing features of the network silicon help?

I hope I'm not spreading misinformation. :) The original poster was 
observing NAPI going in/out of polled mode because the CPU is fast 
enough to process all work per poll. I've seen the same and I'm 
suggesting that the NAPI driver keeps itself in polled mode for N polls 
or M jiffies after it sees workdone=0. This has always worked for me in 
packet forwarding scenarios to maximize packets/sec and minimize 
latency. I'm considering putting a patch together to add this as another 
tuning knob, hence I'm keen to understand what I'm missing. :)
