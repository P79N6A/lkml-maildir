hm, does on s390 scheduler_tick() get driven in virtual time or in real 
time? The very latest scheduler code will enforce a minimum rate of 
sched_clock() across two scheduler_tick() calls (in rc3 and later 
kernels). If sched_clock() "slows down" but scheduler_tick() still has a 
real-time frequency then that impacts the quality of scheduling. So 
scheduler_tick() and sched_clock() must really have the same behavior 
(either both are virtual or both are real), so that scheduling becomes 
invariant to steal-time.
