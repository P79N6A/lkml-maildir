rebooted with a reconfigured kernel to assure it's not cpufreq.
same behaviour without cpufreq.
btw, I'm not 100% sure anymore now running 2.4 whether I really
heard the same noise just quiet. hard to differentiate and also
doesn't matter from my view as it doesn't annoy like the
2.5 noise effect.
--> if it's the same noise, it would be ok, as you don't hear it
normally sitting in front of the box, but running 2.5 is not
nice with that high-pitched tone.
