Agreed. If the p->policy of the wakenup task is SCHED_RT or SCHED_FIFO I
should try to reschedule all the running tasks (not only the one that runs
in the p->processor CPU).
I guess this won't have a bad(tm) performance impact in most of cases but,
yes we can do better. I'll fix this and I'll send the update to Linus.
Thanks for pointing this out! ;)
