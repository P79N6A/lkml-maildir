Must be a problem with the harddisk; I do also have a Abit BP6 board
with two WD800JB which work fine on the HPT366 controller. Maybe you
should try to connect them to one of the PIIX4 IDE channels. Btw: I do
have CONFIG_IDEDMA_PCI_AUTO enabled so I do not even need to use hdparm
to enable DMA.
However I am myself not so sure if I should use the HPT366 or the PIIX4
controller as I got better cache read throughput (hdparm -T) with the
PIIX4 controller and could avoid sharing an interrupt. Maybe someone
here is willing to share some piece of advice?
