They are different instances which happen to have the same length (zero).
But the code will incorrectly decide that they are the same instance.  It
might cause refcounting or accounting errors, for example.  I don't know - the
kernel's a big place.
I agree the risk is low, but if something _does_ blow up, it will do so subtly.
