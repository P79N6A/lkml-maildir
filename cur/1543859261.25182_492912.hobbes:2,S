I haven't tried writing CDs yet, but the last backup on
DVD went fine. And it is really fast: It starts writing
DVDs with 8X and goes up to 18X (Verbatim DVD-R 16X). I
don't see a DMA problem.

Always. I tried 5 different commercial video DVD by now.
All showed this problem. The video DVDs I created in a
Philips DVD  recorder (DVD-R) play fine. BTW, region code
has been set to 2 (Europe) using regionset. There was
no error message, AFAIR.

xine, mplayer.

See attachments.
Hope this helps. Please mail if you need more info, or if
there is something to try.
