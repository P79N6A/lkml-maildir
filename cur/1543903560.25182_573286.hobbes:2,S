I released another version of my tree .. It's still based on
2.6.22.1-rt4 . It's even more bisectable, but still not fully
bisectable.
I included the two fixes I post earlier today,
[PATCH -rt] temporary WARN_ON removal
[PATCH -rt] drop spurious rcu unlock
Here's the combined patch,
ftp://source.mvista.com/pub/dwalker/rt/patch-2.6.22.1-rt4-dw2
And the broken out set,
ftp://source.mvista.com/pub/dwalker/rt/patch-2.6.22.1-rt4-dw2-broken-out.tar.gz
The release notes for 2.6.22.1-rt4 also apply to this patch.
Daniel
