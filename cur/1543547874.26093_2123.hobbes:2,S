They are bad because they cost people money that could be spent more
productively in other areas due to the lengthening of the development
process and the support costs.  Which Linux companies are profitable? 
**NONE**.   The only people making money are hardware vendors and it's a
model like SUN's, where you get a free "machine driver" with every
system you buy.

A lot of problems are related to other people code, new hardware, etc. 
How do you tell a customer who is giving you money to "be careful" when
their system crashes and the field service rep hasn't a clue as to
what's wrong?  I've been supporting computer customers for over 20
years, and this is not an answer that will give them warm and fuzzy
feelings about using your solution if you have no way of solving
problems quickly.  Like any tool, it is there to streamline and improve
the time to resolve problems -- and increase customer confidence in the
solution.

Then it may be that corporate America weeds out Linux over time if the
costs of supporting it and developing on it are prohibitive -- Wall
Street has already come to this conclusion which is why all the Linux
Companies are being downgraded by the analysts and investors are leary.
Try coordinating a project with 1000 engineers without knowing how much
time things will take?  These are the types of issues this helps, the
business case for Linux ....
