NOOOOO!!!!!
Do NOT do this.  Use pci_register_driver() instead.  Using pci_find_*()
is just broken and wrong for 99% of all pci drivers.
If you do this you do not hook up into sysfs properly.  You do not get
modules automatically loaded for your driver.  You do not get notified
if the device is removed from the system.  And, most importantly, you do
not get exclusive access to the pci device.
As for the original poster, look at one of the many existing char
drivers for examples of what you need to do to register a char driver
properly.  It really has nothing to do with the pci interface at all
(with the exception of when to register it...)
thanks,
