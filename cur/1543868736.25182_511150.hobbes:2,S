Every month or so there are a bunch of patches like this, which do 
various enhancements to the kernel. And these are usually based against 
the release kernel, and all is fine. But every once in a while there is 
a patch which is more urgent, in this case the RAID10 one, which is 
really desirable to get into every kernel running on a machine. Are 
patches marked as needed for -stable also fast tracked to -git inclusion?
If this isn't in -git14 I'm going to rebuild with it before testing 
Neil's NFS stuff. The NFS server test data is on RAID10 ;-)
