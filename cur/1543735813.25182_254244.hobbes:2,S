that's quite straightforward: i guess that an appx 30 character perl program
or a 3 line python program 'd do the job.
or just using opendir() in c, here y'go...
	#include <stdio.h>
	#include <dirent.h>
	int main(int argc, char *argv[])
	{
		opendir(argv[1]);
		sleep(3600);
	}
compile and test:
	lkcl@highfield:~/src$ gcc opendir.c
	lkcl@highfield:~/src$ ./a.out /tmp &
	[2] 23520
	lkcl@highfield:~/src$ 
	lkcl@highfield:~/src$ 
	lkcl@highfield:~/src$ lsof /tmp
	COMMAND   PID USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE  NODE NAME
	a.out   23520 lkcl    3r   DIR    3,2 4096 96983 /tmp
	lkcl@highfield:~/src$ konqueror file:/tmp &
	[3] 23527
	lkcl@highfield:~/src$ konqueror: WARNING: KGenericFactory: instance requested but no instance name passed to the constructor!
	lsof /tmp
	COMMAND     PID USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE  NODE NAME
	a.out     23520 lkcl    3r   DIR    3,2 4096 96983 /tmp
	konqueror 23527 lkcl  128r   DIR    3,2 4096 96983 /tmp
[of course, changing it to "umount -lf" _also_ solves the
 problem by making konqueror break: result, after the first remove,
 you have to manually close konqueror, insert the media, remove
 the media card (again), reinsert it (again), re-run konqueror]

around you, funnily and coincidentally enough, life gets a lot better.
