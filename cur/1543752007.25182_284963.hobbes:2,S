So would implementing the equivalent of hwclock --hctosys keep both
ACPI & APM happy, but not include time suspended in uptime?

It does depend on whether a timer wants a delay against the wall
clock or the rest of the system.  A process may be sleeping because
it's waiting for some other task to complete, or waiting for input
from the user. In these cases I claim time-whilst-hibernated should
not be counted.
Hibernating shouldn't be noticeable to the system. For example, a
popup window that came up an instant prior to suspending which is
normally on the screen for several seconds would vanish instantly
upon resuming without the user ever seeing it.
It also means that a group of timeouts that would normally occur a
large amount of time apart, will suddenly all expire the instant the
machine resumes, causing unexpected or undesirable behaviours, IMHO.
