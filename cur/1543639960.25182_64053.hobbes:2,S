while we're tweaking config options how about one that will turn on all
the features that fall into the catagory of 'if you have this it will
speed up your system, if you don't there's no performance penalty'
I definantly understand why some people will want to turn those off to
save memory, but it would be nice to have one thing to do to turn them all
on at once when memory isn't that tight.
