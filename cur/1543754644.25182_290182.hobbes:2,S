'make menuconfig' is not a lot more work wtf

Need I continue?  There's some 30 or 40 more options I could show.  If
you can't use your enter, left, right, up, y, n, and ? keys, you're
crippled and won't be able to patch and unpatch crap either.

I didn't say that.  I said I wasn't talking about bugfix patches.  I
wasn't talking about "mremap(0,0) gives you root," I was talking about
"preventing following links under X conditions breaks nothing legitimate
but deadstops /tmp races" or "properly setting CPU protections for
PROT_EXEC stops code injection" or "ASLR stops ret2libc attacks."
If you people ever bothered to read what I say, you wouldn't continually
say stupid shit like <me> You get milk from cows <you> wtf idiot
