i've been using v.90 of the tulip driver in production servers since it
came out.  no ill effects whatsoever excepting a spurious message that's
already been explained as nothing of consequence.
what does have ill effects is having any type of cdrom in my scsi cdrom on
boot which results in kernel oopses and subsequent death w/ gerard's ncr
driver ;)
