Okay it's compiling with that change.  Now those two methods look
like:
      Method (_PSV, 0, NotSerialized)
      {
        /* Store (DerefOf (Index (DerefOf (MODP (0x00)), 0x01)),  Local0) */
	   Return (Local0)
      }
      Method (_AC0, 0, NotSerialized)
      {
	  If (H8DR)
	  {
	      Store (\_SB.PCI0.ISA0.EC0.HT00, Local1)
	  }
	  Else
	  {
	      And (\_SB.RBEC (0x20), 0x01, Local1)
	  }
	  Store (Local1, \_TZ.THM0.AC0M)
       /* Store (DerefOf (Index (DerefOf (MODP (0x01)), Local1)), Local0) */
	  Return (Local0)
      }
But I have two worries:
1. The lines that I commented out are not identical (if they are
   identical in your setup, maybe we have different disassembled
   DSDT's?).
2. With those lines commented out, the local variables might contain
   garbage, since those lines initialize them.  The iasl compiler also
   worries about this:
  thm0-ac0psv-line.dsl 10504:                 Return (Local0)
  Error    1013 - Method local variable is not initialized ^  (Local0)
  thm0-ac0psv-line.dsl 10520:                  Return (Local0)
  Error    1013 -  Method local variable is not initialized ^  (Local0)
Should I change the Return statement to Return(0)?
