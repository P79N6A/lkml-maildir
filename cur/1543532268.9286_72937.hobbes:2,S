I guess he wants a truncation to zero bytes if the file was writen to,
but not closed yet when it crashed. For some apps like an ftp server 
that makes sense, but I wouldn't want it on a general file system
(because I value my logfiles)
It also solves the problem of you seeing old data in a block after 
a crash (this can happen with both reiserfs and ext2), so it may be
good for the paranoid. 
Apparently AIX used to do or still does this for these security reasons.
