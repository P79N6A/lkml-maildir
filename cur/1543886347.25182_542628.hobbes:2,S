I guess.....
It is really the comparison that I want to be signed, I don't much
care about the counted - they are expected to wrap (though they might
not).
So maybe I really want
     if ((signed long)(curr_events - rdev->last_events) > 4096) {
to make it clear...
But people expect number to be signed by default, so that probably
isn't necessary.
Yeah, I'll make them signed one day.
Thanks,
