Everyone is expecting yet another one of your lovely recommendations 
which very simply reads: "steal and infect everything you possibly can 
and refuse to pass on the rights that you have received."

As you do your imaginary "painstaking reconstruction" the whole world 
can see you refuse to practice what you preach in the supposed "spirit" 
of your "steal-alike" license because you refuse to pass on the rights 
you have received.

When you stated you intend to secure as much code as possible under your 
license of choice, you mistakenly told the world you had no intention 
of cooperating in good faith with anyone.

Speaking of "Really Bad Ideas," you trained us. The only time we get any 
form of response is when we continue to become more loud, more 
abrasive, more aggressive, and more accusational. As long as people in 
your camp continue to use your license and lawyers as a weapon to push 
your "free as in koolaid" political agenda there will be people like me 
who will stand up and fight against your theft, your malpractice, your 
stalling tactics and your legal bullying.
I hope the name Pavlov rings a bell.
