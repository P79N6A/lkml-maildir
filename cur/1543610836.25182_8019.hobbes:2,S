LOL
The low-level spindles can not walk backwards to find a partition because
of the bogus aliased/virtual LBA(0)s that litter a spindle.  The LBA(0)
count == Number of Partitions + 1;
This is utter crap but it is scheduled to be fixed in 2.5, now that it has
started.
Solution : Do not partition use the entire raw device but that will not
work because of the real LBA 0 -- EEK
