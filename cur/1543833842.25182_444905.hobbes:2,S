Ok, I've read some other threads too and so this claim should be adjusted:
Writing a plugin (not necessarily r4 specific) that changes the semantics 
of objects based on context (i.e. turning a file into a dir) is a bad idea 
IMHO.
Actually, BSD has this double-semantic to a limited degree: you can call 
`/usr/bin/vi /usr/bin` and get some binary representation of readdir.
