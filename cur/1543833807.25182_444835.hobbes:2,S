I have a hardware monitoring chip in my laptop that uses the lm90
driver, and somewhere between 2.6.16 and 2.6.17, it stopped working.  I
don't know why.  I'm going to try installing a bunch of different
versions to track down which version precisely stopped working, but I'm
curious if anyone has any ideas about what might have caused this.
