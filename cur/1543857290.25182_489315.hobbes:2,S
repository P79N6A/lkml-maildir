 This is because to ack the interrupt in the device the MDIO bus has to be 
accessed and I gather for some implementations it may be too obnoxiously 
slow for the interrupt context to cope with.  Note that only the interrupt 
line used for the PHY is disabled (though obviously with consequences to 
any sharers).
