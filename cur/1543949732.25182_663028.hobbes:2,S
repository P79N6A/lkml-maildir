OK...  The v4l-dvb development tree is located on linuxtv.org...
Patches should be generated against the master repository, located
here:
http://linuxtv.org/hg/v4l-dvb
As far as breaking up the patch, it would be most convenient for me if
you could break it down such that it is separated by subdirectory, ie:
media/video/cx88/*.[ch]
media/video/saa7134/*.[ch]
media/video/*.[ch]
media/dvb/flexcop/*.[ch]
media/dvb/frontends/*.[ch]
etc... you get the idea --
There's no need to blast all of those patches onto the mailing lists
-- if you put them all into a tar.gz and email them to me privately,
then I'll push them into my mercurial tree and ask Mauro to merge them
into the master devel branch...  They'll most likely end up going to
2.6.26
Having them broken down by directory will allow me to merge them in
without conflicting with other pending changesets.

Mike
