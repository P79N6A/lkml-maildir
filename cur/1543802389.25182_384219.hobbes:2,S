Steven,
   No, this specific machine is UMP although I do have an HT machine I
use once in awhile that might fall prey to what you are mentioning.
   While I have to agree that *if* cdrecord is running at a higher
priority then Jack would get trumped, I'm not positive yet that we
know that's true in this specific case. I have not yet received any
response from the developer of k3b, and while cdrecord is listed in
the setup of k3b I'm not sure how to test that it is really causing
the specific failure I saw.
NOTE: I'm sure cdrecord probably is causing this. I just don't want to
believe it is without some technical confirmation and assume there's
nothing that could be improved in the kernel.
NOTE 2: This case is pathological as I would never start writing a CD
when doing important audio work that requires zero xruns. I reported
it only to learn more myself.
Thanks,
Mark
