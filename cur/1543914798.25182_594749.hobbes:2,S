Too bad gmane patches can't be applied directly, they seems to contain
very strange <at> inside....
However, manually patching seems to be Ok. Kernel is now booting 
correctly, and I have :
...
802.1Q VLAN Support v1.8 Ben Greear <greearb@candelatech.com> 
All bugs added by David S. Miller <davem@redhat.com> 
ieee80211: 802.11 data/management/control stack, git-1.1.13

...
and after some iwconfig configuration steps, I have :

These two patches are a "must be" for 2.6.23 !!!
Eric, feel confident, it seems really to do the trick, and the changes are
subtle and mostly harmless.
Regards,
Paul
