- until there is an explanation on _why_ this condition happens, this is a
  band-aid for an unexplained condition, not a fix for a "logic error" (it
  may have interesting performance effects though);
- the included comments may be ok in the bk repository but they do not really
  add anything to the driver itself;
- please avoid the "else break" in just one line;
- last change to this file found its way through the bk thing on 02/26/2004
  but a set of changes for this driver is available 1) in -mm tree 2) in
  Jeff Garzik's -netdev patches 3) near my fridge. A patch addressing the
  same issue has been posted on l-k the 03/29/2004 as an answer to a remark
  made by Daniel Egger (feedback anyone ?). If you can wait until the whole
  thing is included, it will make my life easier;
- please Cc: netdev@oss.sgi.com for network related patches as well as
  jgarzik@pobox.com for network drivers related patches
