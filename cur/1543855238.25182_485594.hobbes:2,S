I can confirm that it works.  Do you think there'll be a better fix in
the future?  Do you believe that the boot loader on the N2100 doesn't
initialize Ethernet properly or that this is a generic problem on iop
or with this particular RTL chip?  We have fairly good contacts with
the company producing the N2100 so if it's the former it could
probably be fixed. (Altough I'm not sure this is the case given that
Realtek's driver works).
