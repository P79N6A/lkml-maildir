Subject: [PATCH 1/2] Use common cpu_is_xxx() macros on AT91 and AVR32
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/7/30

Several drivers shared between AT91 and AVR32 chips use cpu_is_xxx()
to handle CPU-specific differences. Currently, such code needs to be
inside #ifdef CONFIG_ARCH_AT91 because the macros don't exist on AVR32.
By defining the same macros on both AT91 and AVR32, these #ifdefs can
be eliminated. Since the macros will evaluate to a constant value for
CPUs that aren't supported by the current architecture, any code that
is only needed on AT91 will be optimized away on AVR32 and vice versa.
