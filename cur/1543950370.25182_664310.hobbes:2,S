Whoops, HPA is correct, of course. Manually pushing / popping the 
registers is ugly, how about a larger clobber-list? Let the compiler 
figure out what it wants to save/restore. Only thing to worry about 
is EBP then.
Again, should I provide these patches? This thing just annoyed me for 
a while as I have been patching it in my personal kernels for too 
long.
