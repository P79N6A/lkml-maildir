Did this just appear in recent kernels? Maybe bdflush was hiding the
situation in earlier kernels as it would cause io hogs to block when
things got only mildly interesting.
You might be able to get some useful information with ps axl and checking
the WCHAN value. Of course it wont be possible if like nscd you cant get
ps to schedule :)
