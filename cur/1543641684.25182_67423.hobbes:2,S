Well, I've made the patch, it's rather kludgy but to do this
properly would require modify quite a lot of the code and possibly
API's (I'd hoped to be easily able to create an extra mixer channel
that was visible to userspace instead of pcm, and whose level would
get written to the pcm mixer channel when the audio device was
opened), but it does work rather nicely for me.
If there's any interest in having it in the main tree (as I said, it's
a kludge, but one that's needed/useful on a lot of machines) I'll put
some kernel option or module paramater if's around it, let me know.
As always, suggestions/fixes/flames welcome.
