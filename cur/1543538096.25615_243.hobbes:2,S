The slab allocator is neat, though.  It is capable of storing the
descriptor information for allocated blocks in a separate structure,
so that power-of-two allocations can now be handled _much_ more
efficiently.  The slab allocator can deal with PAGE_SIZE allocations
without having to resort to higher-order get_free_page calls, for
example.  
Given that kmalloc currently uses the slab allocator, kmalloc(4096)
shouldn't be a problem any more.
Cheers,
 Stephen
