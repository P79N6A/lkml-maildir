Please do not make me look at glibc/pthread code since I do not have time 
ATM. I can only speculate on what it is happening. The sys_poll() and 
sys_epoll_wait() system calls, when called directly, have the same 
behaviour (like you can see in the test code snippet). They both return 
EINTR to the caller. When you call glibc's poll(), the behaviour changes 
and function is explicitly made a pthread cancellation point. The glibc's 
epoll_wait() is not wrapped by the same code, and this makes it unable to 
be pthread-canceled. Try to post to glibc the code snippet, and see if 
they want to make epoll_wait() pthread-cancel enabled too.

Yeah, that's Uli :)
