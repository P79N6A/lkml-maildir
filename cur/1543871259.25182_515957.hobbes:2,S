Well, actually, the argument have begun since the version 0.4.0 of HID
simple
interface. I clearly know its weaknesses, and I believe Dmitry said, the
HID bus/tiny
driver way is the most ultimatest way very well.
But (You may guess I will say this word :), before the HID bus or other
better
implementation come , I hope use the extended keys of my keyboard on
Linux, and I guess other people
also think same with me, so we need something here temporarily, even it
do not merge
into upstream code tree.
And, I want to know that is somebody works on HID bus, Can I join it?
Good luck.
