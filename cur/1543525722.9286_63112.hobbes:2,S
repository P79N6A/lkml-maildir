You can figure it yourself, fairly easily.  If you happen to make
start point at something less than the page pointer, it will assume
that you wanted that value to be interpreted as a file offset to be
added.  So providing >3k by ignoring the page provided and pointing
`start' to a large static area all of your own will ONLY work if that
area happens to have an addr > page.  That's a disaster waiting to
happen.
Yes, the start hack can now be removed: it was insufficient, and
AFAIK, it was only used in the (removed-in-2.3) ip_fw.c code.

Which I keep uptodate as rules get inserted and deleted, how exactly?
I don't think you understand the problem.  The solution could have
been to insist that all rules be formatted to uniform length (like the
2.0 ip_fw.c code tried to do, only they used %9u not %10u for the
counters and so failed).

This one I'll address off-line.
