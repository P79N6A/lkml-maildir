That's the type specified by the notifier code.  You have two choices:
int notifier_foo(struct notifier_block *nb, int foo, void *bar)
{
	struct my_bar *my = bar;
}
struct notifier_block nb = {
	.notifier_call = notifier_foo,
};
OR:
int notifier_foo(struct notifier_block *nb, int foo, struct my_bar *my)
{
}
struct notifier_block nb = {
	.notifier_call = (int (*)(struct notifier_block *, int, void *))notifier_foo,
};
So, you end up with a cast in one place or the other.  I know which one
I prefer.

Yep, it's a little unclear.
The policy notifiers are called with struct cpufreq_policy, which have
five values.  The transition notifiers are called with struct
cpufreq_freqs, which has three values.
