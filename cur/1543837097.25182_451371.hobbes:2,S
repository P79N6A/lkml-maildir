This is what I'm currently doing. I was just thinking to use the
new HW-RNG layer and drop common code...

yes I would like to do that but there is a problem: I have no 
access to "rng_mutex" to synchronise hw accesses and I'm
wondering if there's any issue to use a mutex in driver init
code.

simply because in this embedded system, there's no module support.
