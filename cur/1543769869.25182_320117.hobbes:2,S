I have a dual opteron storage server running Gentoo with 2.6.9-gentoo-r1 kernel.
The machine freezes on reboot with last line printing the following mce
CPU 0: Machine Check exception                    7 Bank 4: b442200000000a13
RIP 10: <ffffffff8010fb44> {default_idle+0x24/0x30}

Kernel Panic - not syncing: Uncorrected machine check
I need to perform a hard reboot. It starts working fine. This happens
only during reboots and I never see any other machine check exceptions
when the system is up and running. Any help as to what could be going
wrong.
Thanks
Bharath
