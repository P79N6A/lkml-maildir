I notice that netif_rx (net/core/dev.c) discards packets when it's
in throttle mode.  However, before it does this the driver has already
wasted a lot of time allocating the skb, calling eth_type_trans, etc.
That effort could be saved if the driver checked throttle first.

Hmm, now that I notice, there is one small change in semantics here.
Before every packet that was counted by netdev_rx_stat[].dropped had
also been counted in stats.rx_bytes and rx_packets and this is no
longer the case.  If that bothers you then perhaps there should just
be a separate counter for packets dropped like this.
In my limited experimentation this sort of change has significantly
increased the number of packets I could process when they were
arriving too fast.
