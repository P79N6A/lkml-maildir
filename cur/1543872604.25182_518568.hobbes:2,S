Windows actually have (kernel) graphics drivers that know how to
resume the video. If you boot save mode, they go w/o graphics drivers,
and have similar problems to us.

Did you get options for s2ram that work on your systems? Mail them to
seife@suse.de, and he'll extend the whitelist ;-). In the meantime,
just use -f <whatever>
