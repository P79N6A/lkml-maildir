NDI OGAWA.  And I rebooted to find that all my printers I had defined 
in cups were gone, and I cannot define new ones, getting 
sever-error-internal-error when I try.  And thats much more important

However, before I rebooted, those operations felt a solid as a rock, 
and always returned the same md5sum on a repeat.
