	This looks like correct behaviour. Here is a snipit from a netbsd man
page for signal. I assume we treat SA_RESTART similarly:
     For some system calls, if a signal is caught while the call is executing
     and the call is prematurely terminated, the call is automatically
     restarted.  (The handler is installed using the SA_RESTART flag with
     sigaction(2).)  The affected system calls include read(2),  write(2),
     sendto(2),  recvfrom(2),  sendmsg(2) and recvmsg(2) on a communications
     channel or a low speed device and during a ioctl(2) or wait(2).  However,
     calls that have already committed are not restarted, but instead return a
     partial success (for example, a short read count).
	So, it looks like a UDP echo packet gets lost somewhere (this is not an
'error' -- UDP packets are defined as unreliable, and errors are not generated
when they are lost) Then, if the implementation of signal sets the SA_RESTART
flag when it uses sigaction, then the syscall starts over, and continues to 
wait forever for the lost packet.
	In fact, I tested it with this code:
  signal(SIGALRM, (sighandler_t)Handler);
  sigaction(SIGALRM, NULL, &oldact);
  printf("flags: %x\n", oldact.sa_flags);
The output was;
flags: 10000000
And in <sigaction.h>, we see: 
#define SA_RESTART   0x10000000 /* Don't restart syscall on signal return.  */
If you dont like this behaviour, you will have to use sigaction(), and dont
set that bit. (or unset it) Like: (continuing on the code fragment above)
  oldact.sa_flags &= ~SA_RESTART;
  sigaction(SIGALRM, &oldact, NULL);

ps. The comment in sigaction.h seems wrong.
pps. If you would like to see a complete code implementation illustrating
this, let me know.
