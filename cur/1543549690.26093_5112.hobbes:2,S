Hello to all,
I have one doubt and is as below.
Suppose say the two drivers driver1 and driver2 will install the ISR for a
particular interrupt, say UART0.
After some time the interrupt is generated. At this moment, which driver's
ISR is going to execute ?.
If driver1 ISR is get executed, will the driver2's ISR is going to execute
?. If say driver2's ISR is going to execute, Is the data that interrupt
generated is going to be emulated to the driver2's ISR.
please help,
any help is welcome,
with regards,
Mahadev
