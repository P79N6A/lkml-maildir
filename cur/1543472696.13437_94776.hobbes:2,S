Well, if that lasts 17 years, it's a real-soon-now thing. :-)
On a related note, how could RSA possibly still be patented?  It's in my 
old maths history book as 'the MIT encryption algorithm' developed in the 60s
or 70s, even that book must be around 10-20 years old.  Or is something which
makes implementing RSA efficiently possible patented, or the idea of actually
using it on a computer (instead of to "encrypt" large numbers :-)?
David.
