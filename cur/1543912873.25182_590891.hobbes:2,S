When code is multi-licensed it must be distributed under *all* these 
licensing terms concurrently.  It is easy to understand.  Removing (or 
changing) the conditions that apply to the program from the source code 
and documentation *without* an authorization from all the author(s) is 
illegal.
So, a multi-licensed file remains multi-licensed except when all authors 
agree about a change in the licensing terms.  And it is clear on the BSD 
license that a modification of the distribution terms is illegal.  It is 
the first clause on the BSD license:
  * 1. Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright
  *    notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer,
  *    without modification.
So, removing (or changing) the list of conditions on the BSD license is 
not allowed.
Igor.
