Huh? His patch uses read-write locks and not normal spin-locks, so I don't
understand what you find wrong on it. For the common case (hostname is
really not changed very often) anybody can hold the read lock so there is no
contention. I wonder whether it is worth doing something with the areas
which hold the write lock, maybe for those places the uaccess stuff should
move the data from userland first into some buffer on kernel stack (it is
65bytes at most, so it does not matter that much) and only memcpy it from
there with the write_lock held. But as only root can write to it, no DOS can
happen and so I would not worry.
Just there is one more bug in the patch (besides the one I pointed out in
sparc64/solaris/): in sysctl.c's the patch will acquire write lock even when
it is not needed and that can lead into some sort of a DOS attack (a couple of user
programs, each one reading from /proc/sys/kernel/hostname into some unmapped
area in a cycle).
So I'd instead write:
static int proc_doutsstring(ctl_table *table, int write, struct file *filp,
                  void *buffer, size_t *lenp)
{
	int r;
	if (write) {
		write_lock(&uts_rwlock);
	        r=proc_dostring(table,1,filp,buffer,lenp);
		write_unlock(&uts_rwlock);
	} else {
		read_lock(&uts_rwlock);
	        r=proc_dostring(table,0,filp,buffer,lenp);
		read_unlock(&uts_rwlock);
	}
        return r;
}
Cheers,
