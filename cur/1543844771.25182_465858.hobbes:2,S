Both of your attached pdf's were missing the required fonts to display the 
content on this locale=en machine, as the latest acroread for linux (7.05) 
advised me about both, and the second one, while it did display the cover 
page in english at a scale far larger than my 1600x1200 screen, it 
actually locked up X and I had to reboot.  I thought I had enough fonts 
here to cover everything too.  :(
