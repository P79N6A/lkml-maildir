Subject: [PATCH 0/9] UML - Locking fixes and code cleanup
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Post-2.6.20 material.
The locking fixes are mostly commenting the lack of locking or are making
things const.
There's a bunch of code cleanup - elimination of dead code, unused parameters,
and unused structure fields - and some formatting fixes.
