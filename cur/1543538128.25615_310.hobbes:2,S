Hello!
I'm compiling 2.4.0-test3-pre2 on i586 with gcc-2.95.2 (I hope the the gcc
version is not relevant here).
For some reason -Werror has been added to the top-level Makefile. I
believe this has been a "political" decision, so we should start hunting
warnings from now on.
I believe it's late to make such changes in the Makefile, but anyway.
Some modules produce warnings. In my case, "make modules" ends with:
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/local/src/linux/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes  
-O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -Werror -fno-strict-aliasing -pipe 
-mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 -march=k6 -DMODULE -DMODVERSIONS -include
/usr/local/src/linux/include/linux/modversions.h   -c -o 3c59x.o 3c59x.c
cc1: warnings being treated as errors
3c59x.c:2516: warning: `vortex_init' defined but not used
3c59x.c:2563: warning: `vortex_cleanup' defined but not used
Then I added -save-temps and looked at 3c59x.i:
static int   vortex_init (void)                                                           
{                                                                                         
[skipped]
int init_module(void) __attribute__((alias("vortex_init"))); ;                            
void cleanup_module(void) __attribute__((alias("vortex_cleanup"))); ;                     
What's the reason to use "static"? Why do we make gcc think that
vortex_init is only visible in this file? It is not true.
I believe that exporting vortex_init() is not such a big deal to play
dirty games with "pseudo-static" functions and aliases.
Regards,
Pavel Roskin
