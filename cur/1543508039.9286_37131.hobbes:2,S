Subject: Still need help on kernel issue!

Could anyone help on the following.  Any input is highly appreciated!
OS: RH6.0
System1: Pentium 233 clone
System2: HP E45 Pentium II
HBA: HP Fibre Channel card using SCSI interface
Driver: multi IO test running for a couple hour OK, no data corruption.
Symptom:
System1: Simple multi IO running for a couple of hours.  Then system auto
reboot or panic due to NULL pointer.  All register trace to the kernel
routine with kdb for several times.  Other times either system reboot with
no trace left, or too many messages makes those valuable message scrolling
up.  Any case there is no resister value point to the driver which is loaded
with insmod.
System2: running one io test for less than one hour, system panic with
message:
scsi_free: Trying to free unused memory.
I checked with sd.c and scsi.c.  This scsi_free is called by sd.c to free
the memory sd.c 
allocated for SG list.  There is no chance that my driver can touch those
routine and address.
All tests has no error shown on analyzer.
Could anyone help to:
1, provide some clue what could be wrong?
2, If I use System2 as monitor to track system1 during the test so in case a
lot of message shows up, I will be able to see the beginning of it with
system2 X window.  How do I set up these two system to do so?
By the way, I tested QLogic 2100 card(Fibre Channel)with the driver in RH6.0
and got the same problem.  However, Buslogic card and Adaptec card works
fine (Both SCSI).
Many thanks!
