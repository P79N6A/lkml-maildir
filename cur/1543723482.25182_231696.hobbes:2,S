Yes, but rtasd starts up late in the book process.  Most of the 
"interesting" manipulations with firmware are old history by then,
and thus, any firmware errors encountered during the boot were never 
logged.

If the parms aren't set up, then the rtas_error_log_max is zero,
and, as a result, the message is never logged.  By initializing
rtas_error_log_max to the correct non-zero value, the errors can 
get logged.

Yes, well, you'll be hard-pressed to find a lover of the hex format 
anywhere.  Lets review the history of the design decisions that
got us to this point.  I think a better solution might then become
evident.
-- Originally, these binary messages from firmware were decoded
in the kernel, and printed out in 'plain english'.  However, there
were problems: 1) the format of the binary kept evolving; I think 
we are now up to version 6.  2) the need for supporting version 6 
and *all* of the earlier versions lead to dreaded kernel bloat.
For the current user-space decoder:
# wc *.c *.h
   2207    7056   67959 total
-- So the decision was wisely made to move this all to user-space. 
But what shall the communications link between user-space and kernel be? 
Somebody, somewhere,  I know not who or why, decided that they should 
go into syslog.  And so here we are.
How else could we do this?  I have never had to architect a kernel-to-user
data communications interface, so I don't know what the alternatives 
are.  We could queue them up to some file in /proc, which user-space 
reads.  Or maybe /sys instead ?? Maybe a stunt with sockets? Some 
new device in /dev/ that can be opened, read, closed?  How should 
the user space daemon indicate that its picked up the message and 
doesn't need it any more?  Write a msg number to a /proc file?  
Maybe each individual message should go in its own file, and user 
space just rm's that file after its fetched/saved the message.  
I dunno, I think any one of these could be whipped up in a jiffy.
Convincing the user-space to use the interface might be harder.
Pick one. If it can be coded in under a day, I can volunteer to
do that.

Me neither, Jake knows. I thought the whole point of nvram was to not
loose the messages during crash; the messages are promtly copied out
of nvram once the system is up and stable; nvram is a staging area, 
not a permanent repository.
