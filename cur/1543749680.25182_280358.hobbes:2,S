   /That/ is exactly what FS API is good for: returning error values is 
done via read(/sys/mystuff/errno,&err,4), getting handles is done via 
open(/sys/mystuff/mycomp) and doing new calls is just calling FS API 
with the *file* handle. Registration, depending on your definition of it 
can be viewed as a link(/sys/mystuff/object,/sys/mystuff/subsystem) or 
as a write(/sys/mystuff/subsystem/registered,"object"). Take a peek into 
Plan9 from Bell Labs for inspiration...
