    [ALSA] hda-codec - Add independent headphone volume control
    This patch addes the support of the independent 'Headphone' volume
    control to the generic codec parser.  Some codecs (e.g. Conexant)
    have separate connections to the headphone and the independent amp
    adjustment is needed.
