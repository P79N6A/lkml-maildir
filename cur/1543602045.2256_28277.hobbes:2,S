Subject: [PATCH][RFC] preemptive kernel: ptrace fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I noticed (actually, I had a thought ptrace wouldnt work under
preemption) that strace sometimes locks under the preemptible kernel,
although is killable by CTRL-C.
The following is from arch/i386/kernel/ptrace.c :: syscall_trace:
1	current->state = TASK_STOPPED;
2	notify_parent(current, SIGCHLD);
3	schedule();
What if, between line one and two, preemption occurs?  Now the task
state is TASK_STOPPED, and thus will never be rescheduled.  I presume
this is the problem.  The attached patch fixes this.
Running multiple straces in a tight loop for over an hour shows me the
problem is fixed.  Its obvious the above is a problem anyhow.
However, doing an `strace strace whatever' (ie, stracing strace), it
still enters a stopped state about 20% of the time (before the patch, it
locked almost 100%).  I can't figure out why.  Comments?
Yes, stracing strace is contorted and I don't care, but something else
is obviously wrong -- you can do so on a non-preemption machine.
