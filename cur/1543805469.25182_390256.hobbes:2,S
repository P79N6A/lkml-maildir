Another problem is that it is hard to find whether a new feature in Linux will 
still be present some time later.
If I would try to immediately add support for every new feature, I would have a 
lot of dead code in my sources and would need to put a lot of effort in this 
kind of coding. It seems that it makes sense to wait untill all major Linux 
distributions made a new feature their default for some time.....
