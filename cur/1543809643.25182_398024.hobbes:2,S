Faster??? 
As I see it, extra manipulations have to be done even in the non-congested
case: Every time the lock is taken the locking thread has to add the lock
to a the list, and reversely remove the lock from the list. I.e.
instructions are _added_ to the fast path where you stay purely in
userspace.
I am ofcourse comparing to a solution where you do a syscall on everytime
you do a lock. What I am asking about is whethere it wouldn't be
enough to maintain the list at the FUTEX_WAIT/FUTEX_WAKE operation - i.e.
the slow path where you have to go into the kernel.
