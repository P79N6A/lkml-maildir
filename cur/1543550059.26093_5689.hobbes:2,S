Yes, Alan,
I don't use exceptions, primarily because W9x (and some other OS) doesn't
support it.
But I must support new/delete operators for dynamic memory allocation.
I have rewritten the operators but it don't compile fine.
Have you ideas?
-Abel.

And do you rely on any exception throwing ?
If you use no exceptions (including thus using new and other constructors
that
allocate) you should be ok.
