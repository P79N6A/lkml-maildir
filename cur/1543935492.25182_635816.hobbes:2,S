Well, since I've seen no _hardware_ differences between 4-bit MMC and 4-bit SD, "support" in this case must me "vendor will guarantee it works". And that is not the kind of "support" that needs a distinction in the code.
So, again, if you feel that there is a hardware difference between 4-bit MMC and 4-bit SD then please elaborate as it is my understanding that they are identical.
