Marcelo,
Myself and Matt and previously others (searching the archive shows Eric
Sandeen complaining for quite a while) have noticed the following bug in
blkpg.c.  You can see the most recent thread at:
	
http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&threadm=fa.fo6abnv.1shuppi
%40ifi.uio.no&rnum=5&prev=/groups%3Fhl%3Den%26q%3DBLKGETSIZE64%26btnG%3DGoogle%2BSearch%26meta%3Dgroup%253Dfa.linux.kernel
Has this patch just missed inclusion or do you have a reason to leave
it out?
Tim

Subject: BLKGETSIZE64 (bytes or sectors?)
Date:	Thu, 17 Jan 2002 14:28:52 -0600 (CST)
X-Mailing-List:	linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
Is the BLKGETSIZE64 ioctl supposed to return the size of the device in 
bytes (as the comment says, and is implemented in all places *except* 
blkpg.c), or in sectors (as is implemented in blkpg.c since 2.4.15)?
It would seem that blkpg.c gets it wrong, that it should be in bytes.  
Assuming that's the case, here's the patch to fix it against 2.4.18-pre4.
Thanks,
Matt
