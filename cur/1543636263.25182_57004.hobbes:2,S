That might be so for the 2.5 code base, I know for a fact that it worked
when it was implemented in 2.4. Maybe with the same lo_pending bug, I
dunno.

Please calm down. You sent me two mails that I haven't gotten around to
yet, excuse me for not making loop my top priority.
That said, please do split up the patches as Andrew/wli suggested. For
the 2.5 one I'd be inclined to just take it as-is, but the 2.4 patch
definitely needs to be split.
