Under what conditions?  Not arbitrary entropy, surely.  If a hotplug script
is present and does not blow up, it should be safe to assume it will be run
upon an event being delivered.  If not, we have a WAY bigger problem :)

We have a conflict of priority here.  If an RT task is affined to CPU A and
CPU A gets yanked out, what do we do?
Obviously the RT task can't keep running as it was.  It was affined to A.
Maybe for a good reason.  I see we have a few choices here:
* re-affine it automatically, thereby silently undoing the explicit
  affinity.
* violate it's RT scheduling by not running it until it has been re-affined
  or CPU A returns to the pool/
Sending it a SIGPWR means you have to run it on a different CPU that it was
affined to, which is already a violation.
Basically, RT tasks + CPU affinity + hotplug CPUs do not play nicely
together.  I don't see much that can be done to solve that.  With the
procstate stuff I did, and with planned CPU unplugs we *do* have time before
the CPU really goes offline in which to act.  With unplanned CPU offlining,
we don't.
