Subject: Re: [PATCH] Remove Bitkeeper documentation from Linux tree
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

If they start to be tools that are used to submit changes to the kernel
then yes they should be included.
remember that the reason for the bitkeeper documentation is to help people
setup a tree that linux (and others) can pull from, not to help people
setup their own tree just for them to hack on. Currently none of the tree
maintainers use cvs/rcs/sccs/arch/subversion/aegis/prcs in such a way that
there is anything that someone hacking the kernel needs to do to be
compatable (other then following the existing documentation for sending
patches) but for bitkeeper there is so this documentation is needed.
