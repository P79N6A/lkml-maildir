Changes to individual pages
---------------------------
mount.2

        Clarify that MS_NODIRATIME provides a subset of the
        functionality provided by MS_NOATIME.
spu_create.2
    Jeremy Kerr
        We can use context FDs for the dirfd argument to the *at()

    mtk, after a note from David Brown and Andrew Morton
        
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=119447727031225&w=2
        Rework the text describing the return value to be closer
        to the requirements of POSIX.1; move Linux details
        to NOTES and add a warning not to rely on those details.
        Add a warning about the -1 to -4095 bug which results
        in a 41 second window where the glibc wrapper will wrongly
        return -1 indicating an error.
vcs.4
    Samuel Thibault
        Document VT_GETHIFONTMASK (new in 2.6.18) and add to example
        program;
spufs.7
    Jeremy Kerr
        Add a little information about the differences to mbox.
