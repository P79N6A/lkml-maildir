i took a quick look and the reiserfs locking rules in that place do not
seem to be easily fixable - this is the tree-lookup code which i suspect
cannot be preempted. The reiser journalling code also makes use of the
big kernel lock. I'd suggest reporting this to the reiserfs folks and
(if it's not too much effort to migrate) use ext3 meanwhile.

weird. This has the looks of a preempt-timing bug (we get a timer IRQ
every 1 msec) - but there should be no preempt-timing when we are in the
idle task (swapper).

i'll upload -P2 in a couple of minutes, it will trace the code that
do_IRQ() interrupted too - that would be quite useful in your case.
