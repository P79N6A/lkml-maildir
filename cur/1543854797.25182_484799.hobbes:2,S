Yes, that's what I'd have asked for. If it works, I expect the device
code to be different, or both manufacturer and device code to be
invalid. Depending on the outcome, perhaps we'll need an override
option so that this test can be partially (i.e. just the device code
part) or entirely (all the FWH detection) skipped.
The base problem is the vague documentation of the whole
detection mechanism - a lot of this I had to read between the lines.
