Platform drivers are secondary drivers.  They're crude hacks used to get a
minimal device into the driver model.  They're necessary because ISA devices
cannot be detected like other types of devices.  Why not use a system with
actual complete bus functionality like ACPI?  If ACPI is available, then there
should be no need to create a platform device.

No, but they should take priority when they are available.  Don't forget that
there is also Open Firmware, which has similar functionalility to ACPI if I
understand correctly.

Exactly, they have limits because they are not real devices.  ACPI devices are
real devices.  They have resource management capabilities, power dependencies,
physical parents, and other features found in buses like PCI.
