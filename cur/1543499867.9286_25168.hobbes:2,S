Why not just do it this way..:
int do_open(char *name, int flags) {
	int res = open(name, flags);
	if(res == -1 && errno == EISDIR) {
		char defname[strlen(name)+9];
		sprintf(defname, "%s/default", name);
		res = open(defname, flags);
	}
	return res;
}

Hmmm... why does the directory need a modification time at all, then? Just
stat the file first (reverse code than above, check for ENODIR).

Ugh, I do think that one should be in a library somewhere.
In the specific case of /etc/services, which should be ordered but only
because the first matching entry "wins". /etc/services is a good example
because I wonder what you'd use as file name in the first place -- the
service name? The number? Any one of the aliases? IMHO the file doesn't
really fit the directory lookup paradigm at all. So why try and force it
into one?
