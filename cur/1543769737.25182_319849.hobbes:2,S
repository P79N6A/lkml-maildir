Yes, this isn't trivial stuff.
I realized one more thing: nd->mnt (the destination vfsmount) might be
detached while waiting for the semaphore.  So that needs to be
rechecked after taking the semaphores.
And the same for old_nd->mnt in case of rbind.  Though I'm
not sure what the semantics should be in this case:
  1) rbind always fails if the source is detached
  2) rbind always succeeds, and if the source is detached it just
     copies that single mount
I like 2) better.  Is there anything against it?
