Is there a canonical way for user-space software to determine how many
real CPUs are present in a system (as opposed to HyperThreaded or
otherwise virtual CPUs)?
We have an application that for performance reasons wants to run one
process per CPU. However, on a HyperThreaded system /proc/cpuinfo
lists two CPUs, and running two processes in this case is the wrong
thing to do. (Hyperthreading ends up degrading our performance,
perhaps due to cache or bus contention).
Please CC replies.
