Again thanks for your help. I rescued most of the hard disc, fsck
succeeded in finding another superblock by itself, and AFAIS (still
checking) all the stuff is still there.
The only thing I hate is the reinstallation procedure (many system files
are hosed, inconsistent md5sums, ...) and that they will carry away my
laptop for quite a lot of days (still under warranty, 2.5months!)
Best wishes
Norbert
