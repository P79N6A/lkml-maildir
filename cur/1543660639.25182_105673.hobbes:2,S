Thanks. I see. Keycode in the kernel should be unified.
I'll use newer kbd utility (kbd-1.08) and rewrite keymap like below.
 keycode 124 = backslash	bar	#Compatibility for 2.4 (for a while)
 keycode 183 = backslash	bar
BTW. I've extracted japanese keyboard specification from OADG's documents.
About OADG, please visit

I attach those files. Usefull?
