Ok, so this truly is a new feature that isn't addressed either by the 
current implementation or my patchset.  Fair enough.
You're specifically trying to avoid having the application know about its 
cpuset placement with regard to mems at the time it sets up its mempolicy, 
right?  Otherwise it could already setup this relative nodemask by 
selecting node 2, from your example above, in its mems_allowed and it 
would always be remapped appropriately.

So, for example, if the task is bound by mems 1-3, and it asks for 
MPOL_INTERLEAVE over 2-4, then initially the mempolicy is only effected 
over node 3 and if it's later expanded to mems 1-8, then the mempolicy is 
effected over nodes 3-5, right?
And if the mems change to 3-8, the mempolicy is remapped to 5-7 even 
though 3-5 (which it already was interleaving over) is still accessible?

Does MPOL_INTERLEAVE | MPOL_F_STATIC_NODES | MPOL_F_PAULS_NEW_FLAG make 
any logical sense?  If it does, I think we're going to be writing some 
very complex remap code in our future.

I think it will work very nicely and the benefit is immediately obvious 
for systems that have large nodemasks.

Well, I didn't cave on anything, I said that we can reconsider it in the 
hopes that other people would add their feedback.  I think continuing to 
discuss this matter with yourself and Lee (and whomever else is 
interested) will lead us to the correct solution.  Since this is an 
internal implementation detail, I think it's important to hear other 
people's opinions since we're the ones who will be hacking the code in the 
future so it's really our opinions that matter.

And it does in my latest series, which I sent to you last night.
