"quite obvious" is not necessarily true, but it's a good rule that we have
tried to enforce.

Why do you think it wouldn't notice? If it is truly nested, then
global_irq_count is certainly not going to be zero. 
You don't make much sense. First you say that the above doesn't catch
recursive interrupts, and then you say that it's too strict:

I agree that we could use "local_irq_count[]" if we wanted to be more
permissive. I don't think we necessarily want to be that.

Do you have any actual reason to believe that your patch actually makes
any difference at all? I still don't see it mattering.
Basically, the rules are:
 - we never enable interrupts locally except when we have the proper
   interrupt counts. So we cannot take nested software bottom half
   interrupts either, because the bottom half code will notice that the
   irq count is non-zero.
 - When the bottom half handler is running, we _do_ have interrupts
   enabled, and the hardware interrupt counters are zero, but at that
   point we hold the softirq lock anyway, so we wouldn't try to re-enter
   the bottom half handler.
So would you mind trying to explain why you think your patch matters?
There _is_ actually a bug, which is that the __sti() in do_bottom_half has
to be paired with a __cli(), because otherwise the above rules are not
always satisfied, but that's fixed in the current pre-kernels already.
