The current staircase cpu scheduler is available for 2.6.9-rc4:
http://ck.kolivas.org/patches/2.6/2.6.9/2.6.9-rc4/2.6.9-rc4_to_staircase8.I.diff
and for 2.6.9-rc4-mm1:
http://ck.kolivas.org/patches/2.6/2.6.9/2.6.9-rc4/2.6.9-rc4-mm1/2.6.9-rc4-mm1_to_staircase8.I.diff
Numerous problems from keeping in sync have been resolved, 
microoptimisations, sanity checks and lots of comments were added, and 
preempted tasks are now placed at the head of their queue to continue 
next after preemption. cpu accounting has been yet again revisited and 
simplified as much as possible after the instability of earlier 8.x 
versions, bringing back stability.
Cheers,
Con
