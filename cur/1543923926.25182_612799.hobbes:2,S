The version that is in there is currently broken from a user-space 
perspective (gdb expects u_ar0 to be struct user_regs_struct *, which it 
isn't for a bunch of the architectures defined); it *could* be argued 
the right thing is to fix it up since it *does* export an ABI
-- specifically, the format of a.out core dumps -- but it is probably 
easier to just axe it; userspace has had to deal with this issue on its 
own for a long time already.
As such,
