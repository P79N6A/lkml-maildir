Is there some reason why the key isn't associated with the MMC/SD card
identifier(s)?  It should be practical to swap several cards in/out
without the kernel _needing_ to discard their keys.  What you're saying
is that you'll cache only one key at a time, and that it won't have
anything associating it with a particular card.  That's not at all how
the key retention service is designed to work...

I thought the MMC vendors expected to see the actual user-typed
password get SHA1-hashed into a value which would take up the whole
buffer?  In general that's a good idea, since it promotes use of
longer passphrases (more information) over short ones (easy2crack).
Plus, such hashing would prevent this issue ... if vendor tests are
done with hashed passphrases, that would explain why this class of
hardware issue got past design validation.
