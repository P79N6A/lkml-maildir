RDTSC is unfortunately quite slow on some CPUs.
But we already use it in schedule for sched_clock(). I think
an interesting approach would be to use this information
and just sum it up in the task_struct. This would still not
account for interrupts and system time separately, but should
be relatively cheap and give more accurate time. Drawback would
be that user tools would need to be updated to read a "sys+user"
count.
BTW perfctrs on most x86 CPUs can count user/kernel separately,
unfortunately it is hard to find a performance counter that
matches real time well enough and they couldn't easily
separate interrupts vs systime belonging to the process.
