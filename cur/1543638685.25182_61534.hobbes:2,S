Hi,
After successfully upgraded to SMP kernel 2.4.9-34 the swap partition
appears not being used,  prior to the upgrade on previous kernel 2.4.2-2
the swap was about 10% utilized. 
The free command gives 0 used, top and sar also report same.
                    total       used       free     shared    buffers  
  cached
Mem:       1027972    1015152      12820         64     171292    
592108
-/+ buffers/cache:     251752     776220
Swap:      2097112          0    2097112
Any idea please.
Thanks in advance,
Daniel
