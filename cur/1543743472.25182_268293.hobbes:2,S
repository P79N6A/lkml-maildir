This will not work for pretty much any bus but PCI because only PCI
allows to detach a driver leaving children devices on the bus. The
rest of buses remove children devices when disconnecting parent.
Also, there usually much more going on with regard to locking and
other bus-specific actions besides taking bus's rwsem when binding
devices. Serio bus will definitely get upset if you try to disconnect
even a leaf device in the manner presented above and I think USB
will get upset as well.
I have tried the naïve approach as well but in the end we need bus
-specific helper to do manual connect/disconnect. Please take a look
at these:
