I would like to try increasing the kernel stack size, but I'm not sure how to go about doing this.  Could someone tell me how to increase the kernel stack size?  (And, has anyone else seen a problem with stack overflows with ACPI?)
Increasing THREAD_ORDER to 2 in include/asm-x86_64/page.h should do 
the trick in theory (not tested). There is also an old 2.4 exact stack
overflow checking patch at 
ftp://ftp.x86-64.org/pub/linux/debug/stackcheck-1
that could be probably ported to newer kernels.
I haven't heard of ACPI stack overflows before.
