Hi I found something intersting, and I wanted to share with all.
I copied the /proc/profile file of host (X86) to a file "my_profile" on the 
target system (XScale) and I execute the following command at the target, the
System.map file for the command is the one generated by cross compiling kernel
for XScale (target)  itself.
./readprofile -p ./my_profile | sort -nr +2 | head -2
Here is the result ....
./readprofile: profile address out of range. Wrong map file?

Any comments? using which we could fix this readprofile problem for
XScale/ARM? I think there is a problem in the way, kernel for XScale/ARM is 
generating /proc/profile file. 
-Thanking you
