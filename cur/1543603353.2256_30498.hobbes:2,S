All programmers
I am relatively new to linux kernel. Please advise
what is the safe way to get the original virtaul
address from dma address e.g., 
dma_addr = pci_map_single(dev, vaddr, sizeof(struct
some), PCI_DMA_BIDIRECTIONAL);
issue_command_to_the_controller();
my_isr()
{
    struct some *some;
    dma_addr = this_address_completed();
--->some = how_to_get_from_dma_addr(dma_addr);
}
Would ioremap work.
TIA
