in the meantime we solve this issue I released a new o_direct patch and
a 2.4.6pre3aa1 with O_DIRECT set like in the patches I sent to Linus at
the start of the thread. As soon as we take a definitive decision I will
update them. (in the meantime alpha users will at least be allowed again
to use O_SYNC with o_direct support applied ;)
