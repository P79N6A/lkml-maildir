Well, I can't even build it... mdadm failes and driver complains with
md: Dev sda2 smaller than chunk_size: 0k < 32k
Different chunk size doesn't make any difference.

According to ntfs driver output my cluster size is indeed 4kb, but it still 
failes to read mounted fs.
Error is now:
NTFS-fs error (device md1): ntfs_readdir(): Actual VCN (0x20006500680054) of 
index buffer is different from expected VCN (0x4). Directory inode 0x5 is 
corrupt or driver bug.
Oh, and my system (and kernel) is x86-64 if it matters.

I've tried that. No effect though.
