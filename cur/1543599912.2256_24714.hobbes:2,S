I don't think that the unmask irq thing is really a problem for any modern
system.  Since the days of 1.2 I've run every system with -u 1.  It's not
a case of: '-u 1' gives a .01% chance of corruption on any system, instead
it's a case of '-u 1' gives a 100% chance of corruption on certain
systems, see the difference?
In short, try the -u 1 cautiously (maybe on a r/o fs, or have backups) if
you're paranoid, but if your system is modern, have no fears.
DISCLAIMER: *if* your system does eat itself, it wasn't me that told you
it wouldn't.
