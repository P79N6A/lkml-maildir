Trust me: mdelay didn't exist when I wrote that.
The code calls the private function that does what I think should've
been kernel infrastructure all along to make it easy to either: 
change the body of the function to call the new infrastructure, or 
replace the call of the private function with the call to the new
infrastructure.
