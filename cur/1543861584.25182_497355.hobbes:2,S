Folks, WTF were you smoking when writing the slim code?  Calling mprotect
from random code to rewoke write permissions on process is not okay.  As
is poking into the dile desriptor tables.  As is ding permission checks
based on d_path output.
Andrew, could you please just drop slim?  The code isn't any better than
the last few times they submitted this junk, and it still doesn't serve
any real-life purpose.
