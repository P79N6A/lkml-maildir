jpcd> Various tests describe this thing as fast (~6.5 MB/sec), and it is the only
jpcd> IDE device I have in my machine, but hdparm only tells me 2.5MB/sec (my
jpcd> DCAS-34330W does 5.8MB/sec according to hdparm, and ~4MB/sec according to
jpcd> magazines).
Only a little realted (but still): Intel Celeron 366 with some Intel
chipset. Originally had 4G IBM DTTA disk. hdparm showed 11.85 MB/s.
Then the disk was upgraded to a 8G IBM DTTA. Now hdparm reports 5.9..6.2
M/s on the first run. Slower than it showed for the 4G disk.
Now the interesting part: running hdparm -t /dev/hda again (and again
and again) shows constantly 84.21 MB/s. This is the part I can't
understand - even if the disk is capable of caching the data, EIDE would
not let more than 33 MB/s through.
This is with 2.0.35, 2.0.37pre-smth is compiled but not tested yet because
it's a remote host. hdparm is ver. 3.1.
