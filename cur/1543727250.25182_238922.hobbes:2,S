ATA method is misnamed, it's really SG_IO that is used. And you want to
use that regardless of the device type, SCSI or ATAPI. There's no such
thing as an ATA burner, and there's no need to differentiate between
SCSI or ATAPI CD-ROM's when burning - SG_IO is the method to use. So
forget browsing /proc/ide and other hacks.
