Look again.
Yes, they may destroy the list, but nobody cares.
Why?
 - nobody will look up the list because we do have the spinlock at this
   point, so a destroyed list doesn't actually _matter_ to anybody
   You were actually depending on this earlier, although maybe not on
   purpose.
 - list_remove_between() doesn't care about the integrity of the entries
   it destroys. It only uses, and only changes, the entries that are still
   on the list.
Subtlety is fine. It might warrant a comment, though.
