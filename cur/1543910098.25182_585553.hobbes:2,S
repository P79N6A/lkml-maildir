pretty direct :)
Sure, it says that it's for arch maintainers, but there is no
reason why users can't make use of it.

It is not just atomic_read of course. It is atomic_add,sub,inc,dec,set.

It is very consistent and well defined. Operations which both modify
the data _and_ return something are defined to have full barriers
before and after.
What do you want to add to the other atomic accessors? Full memory
barriers? Only compiler barriers? It's quite likely that if you think
some barriers will fix bugs, then there are other bugs lurking there
anyway.
Just use spinlocks if you're not absolutely clear about potential
races and memory ordering issues -- they're pretty cheap and simple.

It will return to you an atomic snapshot of the data (loaded from
memory at some point since the last compiler barrier). All you have
to be aware of compiler barriers and the Linux SMP memory ordering
model, which should be a given if you are writing lockless code.

You might find that these places that appear to need barriers are
buggy for other reasons anyway. Can you point to some in-tree code
we can have a look at?
