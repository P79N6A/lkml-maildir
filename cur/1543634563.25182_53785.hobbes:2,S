We definetely need to make it working and cleanup is a good thing too,
but i dont have a VISWS (right now) so i'm limited to trivial mergework.

As far as i understand VISWS fragment in the head.S does 3 thing:
	1) fills page tables;
	2) twiddle some bits in cr3.
	3) loads gdt and idt;
My small brain can't understand why we must do 1 and 3 so early.
BTW looks like we are filling page tables many times (for every CPU).
And why we move stext and _stext for VISWS ?
These are great mysteries ...

I'm doubtfull, does it worth the effort ?

2.5 with James's arch-split patch has most of VISWS code separated already.
The only big trouble that remains is VISWS hacks in parse_mem_cmdline() 
function.
Also when 2.5 will realy use platform driver to support reboot, halt
and power off, it will be possible to split VISWS code from process.c.
