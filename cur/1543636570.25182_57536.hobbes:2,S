Subject: [patch* 1/3] remove 287 unneeded #includes of sched.h (fwd)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch removes 287 occurences of '#include <linux/sched.h>', where 
none of the definitions is actually referenced. In some cases #includes
of files previously pulled in by sched.h are reintroduced to satisfy 
indirect dependencies.
Since some files depend on sched.h being included indirectly anyways,
two more patches are required to make the kernel compile again.
