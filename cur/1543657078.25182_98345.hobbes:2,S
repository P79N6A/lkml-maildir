I'm not announcing every release, but we're coming up to 1.0 sometime
soon, as the TODO list is shrinking rapidly: top is man pages, which
I'll be working on now.

Significant improvements this release:
o Implemented "remove", "--ignore-install" and "--ignore-remove", and
  use them in modprobe.conf2modules.conf.
o Loop reporting improved.
o Warn about lines in config file which aren't understood.
o Workaround for devfsd (which calls modprobe -C /etc/modules.conf).
o Testsuite implemented (also available above)
o Lotsa little bugfixes.
Special thanks to Roger Luethi for all his hard bugreporting!
Cheers,
Rusty.
