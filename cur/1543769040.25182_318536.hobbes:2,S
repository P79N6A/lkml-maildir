This approach has already been used in production by various major
applications and is even obsolete, now replaced by remap_file_pages()
(in Linux), where it and its counterparts in other operating systems
have been in use in production by various major applications for some time.
remap_file_pages() allows virtual pages in an mmap() area to correspond
in an unrestricted fashion to the pages of the underlying file, and to
alter this correspondence at will.
In particular, Oracle's "vlm" option does this.
