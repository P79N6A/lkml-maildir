FAT is abnormal filesystem, even when created on a normal device :)

it does bother me in that area as well. I am not sugegsting that Linux
should behave like SVR4 or SVR5 in that aspect but if it chooses the way
of, e.g. AIX it should be at least as tolerant - AIX's "oom" situation is
less wilde than Linux's. However, I would be happy if it was configurable
- CONFIG_SWAP_ALLOC_POLICY = "Linux traditional" or "SVR4 foolproof"
(I bet some "smart ass" will tell me it is already possible with some
weird combination of /proc/sys/ sysctl :) I love "smart ass"-es )

yes, I agree with your last paragraph. Fortunately, there are still
plenty of things where Linux can (and should) be improved :)
