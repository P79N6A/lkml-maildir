Not quite.
First, please turn these back into normal functions in random.c.
Inlining functions is generally discouraged these days unless you have a
good reason and numbers to back it up.
Second, as I tried to explain above, BUG_ON(!desc) is doing very little
that the subsequent desc->timer_rand_state wouldn't already do
(generating a traceback). In cases where dereferencing NULL should never
happen, it's preferable to not add the extra check and just let the oops
happen. We'll still get a backtrace if anything ever goes wrong, but we
won't have wasted any code space or CPU cycles when it doesn't.
