heres hoping that someone will be able to answer my question, as i have 
searched many places and have been unable to find the type of answer i am 
looking for. i did find the short description of the module in the .c file 
for each, but nothing more detailed.
using 2.6.20 kernel
with or without the following modules loaded i am able to utilize the disks on 
my system, therefore what functionality do the following modules provide?
kernel/drivers/ide/ide-generic.ko
kernel/drivers/ide/pci/generic.ko
kernel/drivers/ata/ata_generic.ko
