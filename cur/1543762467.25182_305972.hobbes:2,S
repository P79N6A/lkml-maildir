BIOS boot messages didn't seem to indicate a firmware version, but
this card was only available in stock in early March, so its fairly
likely to have the latest firmware (2/23/05).

We've run it here with CARM_MAX_Q = 32 with a custom stress testing
script and haven't had any incidents so far. CARM_MAX_Q = 33 goes
bad instantly.
