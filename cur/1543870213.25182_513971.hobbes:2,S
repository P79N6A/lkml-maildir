Oops, sorry about that but no, that will not work.
There's piece of paper, called ACPI specification, and we are
following it.
Bug is not in our implementation.
Bug is in the ACPI specs... it does not explicitely allow you to go
out and bitbang i2c, and you do it, and you get problems.
Now, you may try to change specs to be hwmon-friendly... good luck.
But currently hw manufacturers follow ACPI specs, so we have to follow
it, too; bad luck for hwmon. BIOS hiding smbus from you is good hint
you are doing something wrong...?
