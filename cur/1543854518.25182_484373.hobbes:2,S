 I wouldn't change that, the /proc interface to rtc is old
 and should not be used anyhow. Here I'm trying to mimic
 the behaviour of the original one.
 sysfs provides a much better interface
 (once we'll have all the attributes exported, of course :) )
 I don't know if there's any user space tool relying on this.
 If yes, then it should be fixed.
 Any thoughts?
