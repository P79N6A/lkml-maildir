I was tracking down a possibly unrelated problem with USB wlan device
(GW-US11H) and suspected this to be a cause of the problem.
Incidentally, if anyone has any success using USB wlan device
(GW-US11H), I'd like to hear that ... it's rather inconvenient to be
at Debian Conference with a wireless connection that hangs your
