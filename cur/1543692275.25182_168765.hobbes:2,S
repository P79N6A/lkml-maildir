With test6, keyboard repeat takes very noticably longer to kick in after X
has been started (for both X and console). In test5, starting X makes no
difference.
Also, if you move your test5 .config forward and lose sound, you may find
that you now have to enable gameport in input devices to be able to select
(and thus, compile) your sound card driver.
On the up side, the scheduler changes make the infamous xmms skips go away
(for my purposes).
