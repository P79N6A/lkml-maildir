I agree with your approach Olaf. Better _fix_ first mount to remove
totally mtab support, and after put in /proc/self/mount the additional
info that previously only existed in /etc/mtab. Or i'm afraid that
it will never be removed...
Heck, i should learn myself some kernel programming and add the
new options to /proc/self/mounts. I'm really tired of having an
/etc/mtab file in my system...
