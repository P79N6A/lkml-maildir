Daniel - you should be aware that the -mm genirq lineup does _not_ 
include the ARM bits. Those changes go via the normal ARM QA and merge 
path, i.e. via rmk. The -mm lineup only includes the generic bits (for 
type-based platforms). In any case, they dont impact upstream genirq 
merging plans.
(The omap thing in the armirq queue is likely some small thing. Thomas 
is checking it.)
