From Documentation/kbuild/makefile.txt:
--- 3.7 Compilation flags
    ccflags-y, asflags-y and ldflags-y
        The three flags listed above applies only to the kbuild makefile
        where they are assigned. They are used for all the normal
        cc, as and ld invocation happenign during a recursive build.
        Note: Flags with the same behaviour were previously named:
        EXTRA_CFLAGS, EXTRA_AFLAGS and EXTRA_LDFLAGS.
        They are yet supported but their use are deprecated.
        ccflags-y specifies options for compiling C files with $(CC).
        Example:
                # drivers/sound/emu10k1/Makefile
                ccflags-y += -I$(obj)
                ccflags-$(DEBUG) += -DEMU10K1_DEBUG
