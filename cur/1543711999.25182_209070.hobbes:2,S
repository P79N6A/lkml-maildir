As you wish.

Yes, having -nice patch with bootsplashes, translated kernel messages,
and swsusp eye-candy would work for me. Feel free to maintain it.

You see, 10 lines in printk is probably good enough reason not to
include that patch in kernel, because its "too ugly". Plus it does not
work if printk _was_ from interrupt context.
swsusp really should not have patch any code outside kernel/power.
