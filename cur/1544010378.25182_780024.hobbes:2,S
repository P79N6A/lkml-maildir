Actually, I said carry in skb_frag_struct not skb ... that allows for
merging of skbs with different page sources.  The API changes would have
to allow setting at this level.

The way you transmit the information you want notification is done by a
private tag in struct page, so you're carrying the information on an
object that belongs to neither layer ... that's the violation.  It's
essentially an extension of the net API that goes via the mm layer.
