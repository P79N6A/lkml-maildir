Not really, no. Someone mentioned a timeout for this as well, but I
think that should just be done in user space.

Either that, or always allow non-fs commands to go through a frozen
queue. Or flag those commands as ok for a frozen queue. The advantage of
either of those approaches, is that we probably don't have to add any
kernel support then and the generic block device freezing/unfreezing can
be used.
