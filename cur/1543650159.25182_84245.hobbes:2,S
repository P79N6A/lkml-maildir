There's the 4 bytes following dev_t in Glibc's definition (call __pad1
in Glibc) which isn't used by Glibc or anything else.  That's still
free even when the kernel changes to 64-bit dev_t.
And if you don't like that to do that, i.e you want to guarantee that
the unused word continues to be zero for older programs (though I
can't think of any reason why it would matter), that's what the
(currently unused) flags argument to stat64() is for.

Ugh.

Given the choice of using fpathconf, I'd rather accept that the
nanoseconds field is not reliable, hence I must ignore it.  It does
seem a waste though - sometimes you are returning good information I
can use, other times you're not, and I can't tell the difference :-(
I'd much rather do this right.  What do you think of storing the
resolution in the unused word called __pad1 in Glibc?
(Btw, it wouldn't bloat the in-core kernel inode, because only a
couple of flag bits are needed there to distinguish known resolution
values).
