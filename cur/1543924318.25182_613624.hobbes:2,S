Might want to strace it anyway... no good deed (such as reporting a potential 
issue) goes unpunished :)

Past performance is no guarantee of current correctness :)  And over an 
Ethernet, there will be a very different set of both timings and TCP segment 
sizes compared to loopback.
My guess is that you will find setting the lo mtu to 1500 a very interesting 
experiment.
