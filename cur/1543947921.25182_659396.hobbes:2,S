The idea is that host drivers shouldn't do that. Once they've called
mmc_suspend_host(), then they shouldn't be poking the MMC core in any
other way. None of this is of course properly documented. :/

Trying to keep up with the PM changes is a full time job. For now I've
mostly ignored it as I don't even have time for the other stuff.
Patches welcome.

It got that way when SDIO got in. It was needed to make it abortable to
solve a rather nasty deadlock situation. I don't remember the details
right now, but it should be in the LKML archives.

They handle both.

I'm not too familiar with that driver, but they've been playing around
with multiplexing several cards into one controller. Might be bits and
pieces of that.
