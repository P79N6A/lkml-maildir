Okay, now bootimg - like LOBOS - can handle huge kernels too:
ftp://icaftp.epfl.ch/pub/people/almesber/misc/bootimg-2.tar.gz
You need to generate a "plain" binary:
  objdump -O binary vmlinux vmlinux.bin
  sync
  sync
  sync
  bootimg -f plain vmlinux.bin
Adding "real" ELF support shouldn't be terribly difficult for somebody
who is familiar with BFD.
ObWarning: bootimg is highly experimental, so be sure you don't run it
anywhere where you'd be overly sorry when losing data.
BTW, I wouldn't be at all surprised if all that removing the 1 MB check
would break is the floppy boot sector.
