Yeah, but most of the patents that are issued does not cover ideas that
need this kind of protection. I think that maybe 10-100 patents/year
world wide is a figure that is more reasonable. There should IMHO be an
invention whose development cost is in excess of several 100 million USD
to warrant this kind of protection.

Trade secrets hinder the development until they are reverse-engineered,
which, if they that important, will happen in a few month or maybe a few
years, if they are obscure. Parents on the other hand hinder development
until they expire, typically 20 years I think.
