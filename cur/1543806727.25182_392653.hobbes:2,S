No side should dominate.

I don't see how a letter such as /dev/hdo /dev/hdp /dev/hdq is much
different than an opaque number tuple as 1,15,0 1,16,0 1,17,0... either
is a string with systematic generation, and that's about it.
I'm still wondering why mtst (mid-layer access to control tape drives)
is happy with /dev/nst0 nst1 ... (device name) and cdrecord (or its
author) isn't. cdrecord or libscg should be agnostic of these schemas
and take any opaque string that works properly for the given system
without complaining. It can invent any numbering scheme it likes, but
requesting that the kernel does it if it has no further use for it is
barking up the wrong tree.
