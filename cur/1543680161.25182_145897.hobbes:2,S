The changes in -pre3 won't cut down on the load reported by top/ps.  The
goal is to cut down on latencies on the box as a whole.  So the load
will still be as high, but you'll still be able to do an ls without
waiting indefinitely for the results.
So, if you are still seeing bad response times, I can send you a patch
to try in private mail (it has been posted here a few times already).
