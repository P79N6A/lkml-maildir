Yup, that'd be fine, and in fact my first version of the patch
did just that.  I introduced "err" because most of the other
drivers I had to touch used "err," and it seemed a bit clearer to me
because it gives an extra hint that pnp_register_driver() returns
only an error code.
But I don't care either way, so say the word, and I'll send
Andrew your patch to replace mine.
