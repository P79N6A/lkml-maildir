  The patch is wrong. You cannot truncate the extent just in delete_inode.
That would lead to inodes with untruncated last extent on disk after
unmounting, which is forbidden in the specification. You need to truncate
the last extent whenever inode is being removed from memory or something
like that... I'm already thinking how to do it and avoid calling
mark_inode_dirty()...
