I think this all is correct, but I have a somewhat offtopic question, hopefully
you can help.
Suppose that we have a global "pid_t NR = 0", and another CPU does
	pid = alloc_pid();
	wmb();
	NR = pid->nr;
Suppose that this CPU sees dd->cur == new, and adds the new item to it.
Now, yet another CPU does:
	nr = NR;
	rmb();
	BUG_ON(nr && !find_pind(nr));
dyn_data_replace() didn't do synchronize_rcu() yet. The question is: how it is
possible to "prove" that the BUG_ON() above can't happen? IOW, why find_pind()
above must also see dd->cur == new if it sees NR != 0 ?
Once again, I believe this is true, but I can't find a "good" explanation for
myself. To simplify the example above, consider:
		A = B = X = 0;
		P = Q = &A;
CPU_1		CPU_2		CPU_3
P = &B;		*P = 1;		if (X) {
		wmb();			rmb();
		X = 1;			BUG_ON(*P != 1 && *Q != 1);
				}
So, it is not possible that CPU_2 sees P == &B, but CPU_3 sees P == &A in this
case, yes?
It looks "obvious" that rmb() guarantees that CPU_3 must see the new value if
any other CPU (CPU_2) already saw it "before", but I can't derive this from the
"all the LOAD operations specified before the barrier will appear to happen
 before all the LOAD operations specified after the barrier" definition.
Thanks,
Oleg.
