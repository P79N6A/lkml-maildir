Can I make a question ? (I'm working for memory cgroup.)
Now, we do charge to anonymous page when
  - charge(+1) when it's mapped firstly (mapcount 0->1)
  - uncharge(-1) it's fully unmapped (mapcount 1->0) vir page_remove_rmap().
My quesion is
 - PageKSM pages are not necessary to be tracked by memory cgroup ?
 - Can we know that "the page is just replaced and we don't necessary to do
   charge/uncharge".
 - annonymous page from KSM is worth to be tracked by memory cgroup ?
   (IOW, it's on LRU and can be swapped-out ?)
Thanks,
