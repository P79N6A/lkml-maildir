Indeed, however, the point still holds:
- Going to something more like the upstream zlib code makes it
worthwhile to see whatever else should be merged;
- Users must be audited for correctness.
In particular, it would be good to have a "preallocate me enough memory
so it can be guaranteed that this will succeed" operation.
