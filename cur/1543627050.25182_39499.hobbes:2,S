Ah, ok.  Haven't heard of this problem before.  The USB core doesn't 
touch any hardware, but only initializes a few things, and adds a filesystem
to the kernel if you've selected it as a option.
Does it also happen if you only build the USB core into the kernel, yet
leave the host controllers and other drivers as modules?
Have you selected any USB drivers to be compiled into the kernel?
Can you send me your .config?
thanks,
