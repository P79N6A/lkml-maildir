It does changes the semantics a little: the script is opened twice
(opening /proc/self/fd/something reopens the file), and the fd after
opening is now be 4 instead of 3 (in the usual case).
It's probably best if you force "something" to be at least 3 -- to avoid
breakage in the case that a script is invoked with stdin/stdout/stderr
closed.  (Bad, but hey).
Or the /proc/self/fd/script suggestion: make it another file in struct
task just like /proc/self/fd/exe (the changes to procfs are obvious).
Then the process sees _exactly_ the same fds as it's expecting.

There are often other reasons why scripts aren't safe.
Depends on the interpreter.
Environment variable problems are particularly common.
Probably the only safe well-known interpreter is perl, and that runs
setuid scripts itself already.
