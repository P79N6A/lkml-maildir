Another *.uu.net originated spam, currently it seems like 60% of the spam
I see is posted from these guys.
I've never gotten any response from them either, not even when I was
trying to track down who it was who had cracked one of our servers. 
I managed to get the connecting ip by a combination luck in being 5
minutes from a connected machine when named died letting him in and good
monitoring software paging me because of that death, but that didn't help
since noone answered my mail.
My personal reaction with uunet has been to mail them, then block mail
from that subdomain once they don't answer.
