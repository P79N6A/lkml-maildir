This kind of spacing matters, too.

This looks ugly.

Would be okay. Notice that I did not add a rule, I just fixed the
examples to be consistent with each other.
Anyway, as in common english, there should be space after ",". There
may be exception to the rule (your baz example), but...
Here's the patch again. macrofun() is used as an example, but it looks
ugly, and is not consistent with the rest of the document.

 Macros with multiple statements should be enclosed in a do - while block:
 
-#define macrofun(a,b,c) 			\
+#define macrofun(a, b, c) 			\
 	do {					\
