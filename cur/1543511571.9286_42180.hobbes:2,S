	The source code for VMWARE's kernel modules is availible,
it comes w/ VMWARE, and may very well be open source in it's own
right, that I don't know about.  In any case, it's out there, and
for a time at least they were giving out 30-day trial-periods of
their software, which included the source for the kernel modules,
so one should be able to get that source.
