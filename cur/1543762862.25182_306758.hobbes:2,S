The effect is that if your console resolution isn't an exact multiple of
the character width or height, radeonfb would fail to set the mode on
console switches. It doesn't happen with 1024x768 and default font but
it does happen with some weird modes, and some monitors (/me lurks
toward IBM) tend to have quite broken default EDID timings.
