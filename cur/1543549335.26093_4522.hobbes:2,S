Here are some of the big ones:
* 64-bit division.  Most such is by powers of two so you can use shifts
  instead.  Probably the compiler should optimize this case
  automatically, but gcc doesn't, currently.
* floating point.  Use fixed point integers.  Floating point registers
  (at least on i386) are not saved/restored in the right places
  (because doing so is very expensive on some CPUs), so you'll clobber
  someone else's context.
* MMX.  See floating point.
* excess stack usage.  The kernel stack is very very small, so don't
  waste it.  Large automatic arrays are BAD.  Use globals or dynamic
  allocation.
* C++ exceptions, run-time types (RTTI) and other
  features-of-the-month.  Stick to C and you'll be OK.
* global variables initialized to 0.  Not necessary, as uninitialized
  globals are zeroed automatically, and that way they don't take up
  space in the on-disk image.  This is a concern for embedded systems.
Also make sure to read Documentation/CodingStyle for, well, coding style.
