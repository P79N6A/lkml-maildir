I have to comment on that... Your original gripe was the we should not
have so much duplicated code - which of course was shot down, we don't
have much duplicated code, basically a few hundred lines at most. And
that solely remains because /dev/sg* still exists and isn't fully
integrated with bsg (the block layer sg, which is probably misnamed as
it could be used char devices as well).
So this mail from you basically shoots huge holes in your original
gripe. The whole SCSI stack is redundant code in this scheme. A quick
check over my current tree shows over 23 _thousand_ lines of code (SCSI
stack + ide-scsi)! Auto-loading modules has _nothing_ to do with it,
it's still redundant code.
I could go on, but the point should be crystal clear already so I'll
stop. Joerg, unless you have any technical arguments please stop this
thread. And here I do mean ones that are correct. You repeatedly either
ignore mails asking you to backup your claims - or you reply to them
saying "Please stop making false claims!". Honestly, I have no idea why
you are doing that.
