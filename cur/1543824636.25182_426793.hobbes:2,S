Another nitpick: It is usually OK to do these things in the same patch
that actually uses the new data (or functions -- eg. patch 15).
If the addition is complex or in a completely different subsystem
(eg. your rescue_pages function), _that_ can justify it being split
into its own patch. Then you might also prepend the subject with mm:
and cc linux-mm to get better reviews.
