Resetting the mtrrs according to match the e820 table is attractive
and it would be even easier to set the MTRR default type to
write-back, and just handle everything else with PAT.
However that would most likely do horrible things to any BIOS going
into SMI mode, and even a more modest scheme with reprogramming
MTRRs would likely have similar problems, where we put something
in the wrong caching mode.
So the only safe thing we can do is not use memory that is not
write-back cached.  That we can positively detect and is a
conservative action so if anything will work that will.
