Alternatively, systems which don't have devfs mounted on /dev can simply
have symbolic links in /dev to the /devfs directory, and other systems
can mounted devfs on /dev.
That way you get to control which of the devfs devices are accessed by
normal programs, by manipulating /dev.  Much like you do now.
