And how did you manage to bring it to this grief? 8)
Jokes apart, if you did not see it earlir, it is new leak,
which is unlikely, but impossible to exclude.
I need to know what you did to search for this leak.
Actually, you might check this:
# cat /proc/slabinfo | grep ip_dst_cache
# echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/route/flush
# cat /proc/slabinfo | grep ip_dst_cache
# cat /proc/slabinfo | grep ip_dst_cache
# cat /proc/slabinfo | grep ip_dst_cache
