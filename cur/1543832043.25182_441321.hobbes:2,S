I was a little bit in a hurry when I sent that comment:
What my patch does is to ensure rtmutex-boosters keep their priority and 
is scheduled to the head of the runqueue at their given priority.
What is ugly is that the scheduler core code knows about the rtmutex stuff 
directly. The previous mail was about how to generalise this so that other 
subsystems with similar needs can use it too.
