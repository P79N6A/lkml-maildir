Once you have a mechanism that lets you prevent the untrusted program
from exec-ing a setuid/setgid program (such as your bounding set idea),
I don't see any added value in preventing the program from calling exec().
"Don't forbid what you can't prevent".  The program can always emulate
the effect of exec() in userspace (for non-setuid/setgid programs) --
doing so is tedious, but nothing prevents a malicious userspace program
from implementing such a thing, I think.
This is only a comment on forbidding exec(), not on anything else in
your proposal.
