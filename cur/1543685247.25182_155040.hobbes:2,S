I agree that people must have something to upgrade to. They're said
"update the kernel from your vendor" or "run 2.4.XX-pre which contains
the security fixes"; but a lot of people don't use vendor kernels and
they don't even know that -pre contains fixes. (where is the
announcement if there's one?)
Can't we have a 2.4.22 which has 2.4.21 + only
the security fixes? Or a 2.4-current which contains current kernel +
security fixes + very important fixes.
I can understand that you can't upgrade the kernel each time there's
a security issue, but this time there're a lof of them, and people
*don't* really know what they've to upgrade. They're just waiting
for a release.
