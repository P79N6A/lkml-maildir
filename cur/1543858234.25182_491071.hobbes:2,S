The NFS read code will automatically flush dirty data to disk if it sees
that the page is marked as dirty or partially dirty. We do this without
losing the page lock thanks to the helper function nfs_wb_page().
BTW: We will do the same thing in our mapping->release_page() in order
to fix the races you can have between invalidate_inode_pages2() and page
dirtying, however that call to test_and_clear_page_dirty() screws us
over for the case of mmapped files (although we're quite safe w.r.t.
prepare_write()/commit_write()).
