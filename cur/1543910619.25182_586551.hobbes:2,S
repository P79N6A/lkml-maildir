Subject: [PATCH] dio: zero struct dio with kzalloc instead of manually
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patch uses kzalloc to zero all of struct dio rather than manually trying
to track which fields we rely on being zero.   It passed aio+dio stress testing
and some bug regression testing on ext3.
This patch was introduced by Linus in the conversation that lead up to Badari's
minimal fix to manually zero .map_bh.b_state in commit:
  6a648fa72161d1f6468dabd96c5d3c0db04f598a
It makes the code a bit smaller.  Maybe a couple fewer cachelines to
load, if we're lucky:
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
3285925  568506 1304616 5159047  4eb887 vmlinux
3285797  568506 1304616 5158919  4eb807 vmlinux.patched
I was unable to measure a stable difference in the number of cpu cycles spent
in blockdev_direct_IO() when pushing aio+dio 256K reads at ~340MB/s.
So the resulting intent of the patch isn't a performance gain but to
avoid exposing ourselves to the risk of finding another field like
.map_bh.b_state where we rely on zeroing but don't enforce it in the
code.
