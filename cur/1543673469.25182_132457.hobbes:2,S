As long as the token isn't explicitly withdrawn. With my token structure, I've
defined it such that if the list_head in the token struct is ever empty, then
the token is withdrawn.
Furthermore, I'm considering it such that the the filesystem will select a
token from the PAG's token ring in the file_operations->open method and will
attach it to the file->f_token at that point for quick reference later.

Someone asked for it, but I suspect if allowed at all it may be best that this
ability is governed by its own capability bit and also that the security
interface should be consulted.
