Well something is burning CPU there, and I do not know what it is.
Things are normal here:
With 2.5.42-mm2++, shared pagetables enabled:
make -j6 bzImage  416.97s user 33.94s system 374% cpu 2:00.28 total
With 2.5.42+last night's BK:
make -j6 bzImage  416.09s user 33.04s system 370% cpu 2:01.15 total
With 2.5.42:
make -j6 bzImage  416.56s user 32.49s system 375% cpu 1:59.69 total
So.  Could you please profile the `noload' run?  Just enable oprofile
and local IO APIC and do:
- add "idle=poll" to your kernel boot commandline
- sudo rm -rf /var/lib/oprofile
- sudo op_start --vmlinux=/boot/vmlinux --ctr0-event=CPU_CLK_UNHALTED \
  --ctr0-count=600000
- time make -j4 bzImage ; sudo op_stop
- oprofpp -l -i /boot/vmlinux
- sudo killall oprofiled
(Do the `make' quickly after the op_start to avoid bogus idle time).
Thanks.
