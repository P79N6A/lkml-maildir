I have the same problem using XMMS in both a UP system running
2.4.2-2 (RH kernel) as well as stock 2.4.4 both UP and SMP.
It doesn't occur right away though.  It takes a half hour maybe
an hour, perhaps more.  I dunno if it is tied to system activity
or not.
This occurs on a 300Mhz K6-III, and a dual 1Ghz Xeon Compaq
Proliant ML530.  It doesn't occur with enough frequency to be
able to force it to reproduce.

Signature poll:  I'm planning on getting a 12 or 16 port autosensing
10/100 ethernet switch soon for home use, and am interested in hearing
others recommendations on what to buy.  Cost isn't as important as is
functionality and quality.  Any suggestions appreciated.
