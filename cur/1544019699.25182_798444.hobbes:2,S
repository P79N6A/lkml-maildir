I tried a few things, but no.  Passing in just RAX, and then pasting 
CLBR_##reg works, and the assembler accepts %RAX - but - the asm code 
also #defines RAX <some stack offset>, so the assembler ends up seeing 
%48.  I considered renaming all the CLBR_ defines to CLBR_rax, but that 
looks unhappy too.  So I stayed with this.
