Doh!  yes, thanks for pointing that out.

Yes.  
There have been ABI changes in the past.  In the end, I assume 
it's a question of relative desirability ("how broken is existing 
behaviour"; or: "was that behaviour ever desirable/portable 
anyway?") versus relative likelihood of breaking applications.
