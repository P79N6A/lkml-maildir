Its true. Its still true whether you demand people stop saying it or
not.

And a CD ROM is a round thing with removable optical media, while a hard
disk has a different command set and is magnetic. They are juat as
different. Its simple a matter of correct architecture.

Thats a different issue. IDE has to stop the CD and disk drivers from
stomping on each other over a shared bus. This is the problem of them
knowing each other exist and interacting. This is the point you need to
be able to find DRI from FB and vice versa. The point they need to know
about each other being loaded.
Multiple registrations on the same object is exactly what the class code
in the kernel is for. 
You end up with a VGA class driver that knows all the video devices. 
That has the usual match/install functions to allow the frame buffer to
attach, but can also have other sets for attaching different client
classes.
