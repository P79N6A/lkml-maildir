This sounds racy, at least with your simple description. Even other CPUs
could walk their run queue while the IPI is being processed and reset the
cpus_allowed flag too early. I guess it would need a check in the 
schedule loop that restores cpus_allowed that the current CPU is the only
on set in that task's cpus_allowed. This unfortunately would hang the
process if the CPU for some reason cannot process schedules timely, so
it may be needed to add a timestamp also to the task_struct that allows 
the restoration of cpus_allowed even from non target CPUs after some
time.
