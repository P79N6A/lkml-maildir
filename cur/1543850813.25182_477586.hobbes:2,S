I have four machines showing problems with 2.6.19-rc3-mm1.  In each case
they appear to have lost their ethernet cards completely.  I have a
ppc64 using ibm_veth, two ppc64's using e1000's and an x86_64 using a
Tigon 3.
Before I had results from the non e1000 machines I did try backing out
all e1000 patches to no effect.  I also had a quick scan of the
changelogs for net/ and nothing jumped out at me.
Any suggestions what to hack out next?
