Just a quick extra comment. It would be nice if you could use the host 
controller name when doing the initial printk:
-         printk(KERN_INFO DRIVER_NAME ": MMC Controller %d set up at 
%8.8X (mode=%s)\n",
-                host->id, host->iobase, dma ? "dma" : "pio");
+         printk(KERN_INFO "%s: MMC Controller %d set up at %8.8X 
(mode=%s)\n",
+                mmc_hostname(mmc), host->id, host->iobase, dma ? "dma" 
: "pio");
It gives a nice, visible connection between the host name and the hardware.
