They don't return a value because doing so is meaningless.  You aren't
going to get past the panic.  The compiler should know that assuming
panic is properly tagged as a function that cannot return.
You may also want to check up on your C since having a break after
a return is, well, kinda silly.  In all the usage of this inline, the
width is constant, so gcc should completely optimize away the switch
and surrounding code.
