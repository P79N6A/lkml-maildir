First I kept these patches around.
Then I saw that Andrew picked them up for 2.6.2-mm1, so I didn't need
to keep them.
Then I saw I had to either keep them, extract the summary info and keep that,
hope that I could find it while searching the LKML archives when I need it,
reverse engineer the code (how many times would I end up reading the code
if I got stuck by the relabelfrom/relabelto stuff?), or otherwise get lucky.
This isn't the first time that we've had patches go by with nice explanitory
text that doesn't make it into the kernel tree.  Does anybody have a good
idea on what we can/should do about these?  Even just dropping them into
one big Documentation/hints file might be good enough.
