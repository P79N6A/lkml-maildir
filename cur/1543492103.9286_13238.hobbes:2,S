but it's not just the lower 3 bits that are unsignificant. It's 8
unsignificant bits. (8.1 actually :) It should be 'inode >> 8' (which is
done by the log2 solution). Unless i'm misunderstanding something. The
thing we are AFAIU trying to avoid is 'x/sizeof(inode)', which can be a
costy division. So i've substituted it with
'x/nearest_power_of_2(sizeof(inode))' which is just as good in getting rid
of insignificant bits.
