As long as you have a P4 and use the P4 support you will get
hyperthreading with 2.4.19 (CONFIG_MPENTIUM4=y).  2.4.18 you have to also 
turn it on with a lilo option of acpismp=force on the kernel command line.
You might want to balance IRQs across the cpus.  Ingo Molnar has created
patches for this, which I've put on my website
at 
http://www.hardrock.org/kernel/.
hyperthreading will give you some performance boostes, but *only*
if you have many runable processes a majority of the time, or very heavily
threaded applications running on the system.  (an example would
be running 4 setiathome clients on a dual processor system).
