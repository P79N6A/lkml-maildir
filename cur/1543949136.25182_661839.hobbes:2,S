As far as I can see, yes. The b43 driver is pretty mature these days.
It does base on the codebase of the bcm43xx driver and the most intrusive
changes date back over a year ago. The driver got lots of testing in the
meantime.
I do own the most common device flavours (except the 4311. So if somebody
has one do donate.. :) ) and I don't see any regressions.
Most "regressions" come from people not installing the updated firmware.
But that's an issue we simply cannot solve in the driver.
Of course, as I always said, if some last-minute regression appears, we
will defer the bcm43xx removal. So I hope I'm not _really_ the worst
maintainer ever, although I try hard to, when it comes to patches I
really dislike. ;)
