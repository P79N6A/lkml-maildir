If you have another, faster, machine available you could build the
kernel(s) on that one. You don't have to build a kernel on the same
machine that is later supposed to run it.
Also, if you have more than one machine (even if they are not
especially fast) then you can use distcc (
http://distcc.samba.org/
) to
distribute the build over multiple machines which can speed up a build
a great deal.
