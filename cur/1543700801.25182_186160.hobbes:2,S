I sure wouldn't bet on that. More likely, he's simply
losing ticks. He has a Duron processor, which is
highly unlikely to be hooked up to some crummy
speed-changing hardware.
I had a 1 GHz Pentium III box with the same problem.
Linux would give up on the perfectly-correct 1 GHz
clock source in favor of trying, and failing, to
count 1 kHz ticks from the crummy old PIT hardware.
Time loss got so bad that NTP would simply give up.
IDE activity may have had something to do with it.
In his case, maybe ACPI polls something while
interrupts are off.
