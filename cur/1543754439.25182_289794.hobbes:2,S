PMTU bug, sure -- but one that came late in RC2.  Remember:  same firewall
in both cases, but only RC2 breaks.  The ICMP packet has landed in
the RC2 system, which ignores it.  2.6.10 handled it correctly... I
suspect one of the TCP cleanups borked this.
My current workaround is "ifconfig eth0 mtu 1492" but that's not
something I'd expect to keep.
