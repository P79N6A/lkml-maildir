I am doing the same for the HighPoint-Tech 370 (talking about the RAID driver). Disk-striping is
working so far. My code is based on the kernel patches for MDs from Neil Brown. I created an own
RAID-personality for the module.
When I looked at the FreeBSD implementation I had the idea of making a "supermodule" which could
contain serveral IDE-RAID drivers (e.g.: Proise FastTrack + HPT370). There would be a super
personality for ATA-RAID and several low-level drivers for the individual controllers.
Interrested? Ideas? Hints, Tips, ...? Wanna team up? <8)
