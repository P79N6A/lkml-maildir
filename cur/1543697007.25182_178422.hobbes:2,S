# [BUG][PATCH] isapnp does not detect some cards
# 
# From: Paul L. Rogers <rogerspl@datasync.com>
# 
# Plug and Play Cards (Tested only one at a time.  One ISA slot):
#               NCI1000 NewCom  33.6KifxC  ISA PnP Data/Fax Modem
#               ADP1542 Adaptec AHA-1542CP ISA PnP SCSI Host Adapter
# 
# Problem Description:
# The Linux ISA PnP subsystem assumes that the checksum of the
# Vendor ID and the Serial Number returned by a PnP card in
# the Config state is valid.  However, the Plug and Play ISA
# Specification (Version 1.0a) found at
# 
http://www.nondot.org/sabre/os/files/PlugNPlay/PNP-ISA-v1.0a.pdf,
# states in Section 4.5 that when a card enters the Config state
# directly from the Sleep state and the 9-byte serial identifier
# is read, the checksum byte is not valid.
# 
# While some cards do return a valid checksum in this case
# (ADP1542), others do not (NCI1000) and thus are not detected
# since isapnp_build_device_list requires that the computed
# checksum match the checksum returned by the card.
# 
# Workaround:
# Continue using the isapnp utility instead of the kernel PnP support.
# 
# Proposed solution:
# The attached patch removes checksum related tests from
# isapnp_build_device_list and instead relies on the behavior
# documented in Section 6.1 of the PnP ISA Specification that
# specifies that Bit[7] of Vendor ID Byte 0 must be 0 to
# determine if the selected CSN is returning valid data.
# 
# A longer term solution would be for isapnp_build_device_list to
# only access CSNs that were assigned during the Isolation process.
