due to the PML4 feature, the clear_page_tables() function changed to
clear_page_range(), changing its (first,size) argument to (first,last). 
Normally it's called with (0,TASK_SIZE) which normally is PML4-aligned,
but in the (relatively rare) do_munmap() use this is not the case. We
correctly calculate the range that could be cleared, but it's not
PML4_SIZE aligned.
The solution is to clip both 'first' and 'last' to PML4_SIZE boundary.
Since when we calculate 'first' we add at least +PML4_SIZE to the value,
it is safe to clip 'first'. It is obviously safe to clip 'last'.
The patch below implements this fix - it boots & works fine and shmt04
doesnt crash anymore. Andi, do you agree with this fix?
