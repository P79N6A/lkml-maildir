The linux-wlan-ng project only handles the prism2/2.5/3 chipsets, which 
are *extremely* well documented (and 2.4G-only), so there really isn't 
anything to "handle"; from the driver perspective  you just say "give 
me channel X" and that's it.   If the eeprom-based tables say you can 
use the channel, it lets you; otherwise it's No Soup For You.  
Intersil is a poor example; they've generally been quite forthcoming
with documentation.  Granted, the docs for the PrismGT/etc stuff are
pretty bad, but you can get them without selling your soul. 
(it's also worth mentioning that Intersil partially funded
linux-wlan-ng's development)
RF tables and regulation might be an excuse chipset companies use to
hide their specs, but the real reasons tend to be a bit more along the
lines of:
"We want to protect our valuable IP"
...which translates to:
"We want to protect our violations of other people's valuable IP"
It's CYA, plain and simple.  They're so terrified of litigation that 
they feel that *any* semi-public information (even if only source code) 
is a threat. 
Many of them genuinely want to provide Linux support, in the form of
binary drivers much like Windows has.  Then they balk when realizing
what a support hell (and $$$) it will be to pull it off without
providing source code, thanks to the monolothic nature of the Linux
kernel. 
Or at least that's been my experience in the past year.
