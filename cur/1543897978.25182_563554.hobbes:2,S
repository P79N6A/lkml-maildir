Why not look at mm/memory.c::get_user_pages and look at how it uses the
**pages argument? The fact that it is passing in the address of a
pointer to a struct page, along with the function name should be a big
hint as to what it is doing...
<spoiler>
more or less it is looking up the struct page pointer for the user address
passed in and returning it to the calling function via &page...
