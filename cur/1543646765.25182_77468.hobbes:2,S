There are a few things that could help here:
1) Andrew Morton's io scheduler patch (read-latency2), which is
   in the -rmap kernel
2) reducing the number of outstanding IO commands in the 3ware
   controller/driver, so akpm's io scheduler gets a chance to do
   its work
3) better readahead, if possible...
regards,
Rik
