Ah, something like this is nice to have, but you duplicated a _lot_ of
code in getting here.  A patch moving some of the common Compaq code to
the pci_hotplug.o module, which would enable a lot of the compaq and
acpi driver code to be removed would be greatly appreciated.

A layer you came up with?  I would hope this driver would match it :)

We have common hotplug operations right now.  What's wrong with those?
I'm not going to have some API that looks the same for PCI cards and
memory DIMMS, that's just dumb.  They are different things, and do
different things, don't try to merge them together.

Hm, and also you can now plug in closed source hotplug drivers, as you
went around the existing EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL() symbols.  I've told you
about this _many_ times in the past and will never accept such a patch,
as you have said this is your end goal.

Because of the above comments, no, I will not.  What I will accept would
be:
	- move the common code that you have already identified into the
	  pci_hotplug core.  That will enable the Compaq and ACPI
	  drivers to remove a lot of code (and hopefully the IBM driver,
	  but don't worry about that if it doesn't look obvious.)
	- stick with the existing pci_hotplug API for hotplug PCI
	  drivers.  If you need something different from what is
	  currently there, please let me know.  But do NOT try to go
	  around the EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL functions by providing your own
	  shim layer, that's not acceptable.
	- please remove all typedefs from the code.
	- remove all LINUX_VERSION checks as they are necessary for code
	  that is in the main kernel tree.
thanks,
