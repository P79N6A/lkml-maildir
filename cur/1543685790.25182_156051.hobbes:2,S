What if you kept crypto API optional, made random.c a config option, and
make that depend on the crypto API. Then -- and this is the non-obvious
part -- implement a super lame replacement for get_random_bytes() [what
I assume the various parts of the kernel are using] for when
!CONFIG_RANDOM is not set?
You can do a simple PRNG in <10 lines of C. Have the kernel seed it on
boot with xtime or something else lame.
