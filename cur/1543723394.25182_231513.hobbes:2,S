Hi,
I'm working on porting modular real time scheduler on linux layer ... 
I'm using only kernel thread... Actually I dont't call the 
kernel_thread(init, .... and I inizialize my scheduler and OS struct... 
I schedule my kernel thread... I'm trying to use the printk in the 
kernel_thread but sometimes I dont't having result on the console. The 
console does't print my debug on screen... Is there an unburred printk?
Best regards
Michael Trimarchi
