Yeah but malicious people are more determined than whitehats and
greyhats.  If I'm trying to find bugs to help you fix them, I'm not
going to waste my time on running your binaries through a debugger.  If
I want to use your machine as a sock puppet to attack SCO, then maybe.
In contrast, if I've got a good background in programming and want to
help you find and fix security bugs, it's not that big a deal for me to
brush over your source code.  If I'm just in there to improve it or add
new features, I might even ACCIDENTALLY stumble over something.  This is
where OSS becomes more secure :)
I think we're on the same page, Linus :)

It'd need control.  You can start an open security advisory list if you
like, but don't just flip off the vendors who want to keep their
security advisories quiet until they have a fix.
Aside from that, go for it.
