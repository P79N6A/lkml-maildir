Hi,
This is a minor issue, but I thought I'd report it anyway.
When I do a 
# cat /proc/cpuinfo
on my AlphaServer 400 4/233 I get the following (IMHO wrong) output:
cpu                     : Alpha
cpu model               : EV45
cpu variation           : 7
cpu revision            : 0
cpu serial number       :
system type             : Avanti
system variation        : 0
system revision         : 0
system serial number    :
cycle frequency [Hz]    : 233334892 est.
timer frequency [Hz]    : 1024.00
page size [bytes]       : 8192
phys. address bits      : 34
max. addr. space #      : 63
BogoMIPS                : 229.11
kernel unaligned acc    : 0 (pc=0,va=0)
user unaligned acc      : 0 (pc=0,va=0)
platform string         : AlphaStation 400 4/233
cpus detected           : 1                                               
                    
The problem is that the 'Platform string' is set to 'AlphaStation 400 
4/233' when this machine is quite clearly (it's printed on it) a 
'AlphaServer 400 4/233' ( It is this machine: 
http://www5.compaq.com/alphaserver/archive/400/alphaserver400.html
 ).
It's nothing important, and it runs Linux just fine. Just thought it 
would be nice to see it fixed (if it is at all possible to tell the two 
different systems apart from the kernels point of view).
