This should be impossible.  The error handler API requirement is that
the driver relinquish a command once it returns success from any error
handling callback ... and if it never returns success, we simply offline
the device and never use it again.  This is the principle behind the
command reuse: we only try an additional command *after* error handling
succeeds, so the error handler now owns the command absolutely.
