As you say, there are BIOSs that do not support MMCONFIG. Thus, CF8
access is not only a workaround to boot a system. There are systems
that really use CF8 access. Also, MMCONFIG depends on many conditions
that must match. Cfg space must be mapped, the memory must be E820
reserved, MCFG table must be set, access to MMCONFIG must be enabled
for the device. Many things that may fail and can partly not be fixed
by the OS.

Recent (10h) and upcomming CPU families make heavy use of PCI ext cfg
space for certain CPU features. Setup of the extended interupt local
vector table for IBS (used with Perfmon2) is one example. CPU
designers do not take care anymore if a feature is in the base or
extended config space. So access to PCI ECS is essential.

As said above, I do not see CF8 access as a workaround. I expect my
system to work in the same way also if MMCONFIG is not available.
