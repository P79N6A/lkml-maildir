So far so good.

Also good.  But the fact is, the LED core *does* know when it is calling
from a scheduleable context (e.g. from sysfs handlers), and that's not an
uncommon path either.
The trigger code is more complicated, I don't know if most of its calls to
brightness_set are in safe or unsafe contexts for sleep.  But the people
calling the trigger code certainly would.

It is the preferred way to do these things.  If you don't do it like that,
both gpio and *all* ACPI-based LED devices will have to always defer to
workqueues.

And we will have to always defer to workqueues on drivers that can't operate
from an atomic/interrupt context?  Even when there would be no need for it
because brightness_set is not being called from an non-scheduleable context
at all?
I hope I can live with that for LEDs (I have to think about LED
brightness_get first before I am sure about that), but I don't like it at
all for the long term.
