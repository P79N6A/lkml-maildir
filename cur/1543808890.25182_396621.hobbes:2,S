It seems that this "discussion" is missong new ideas and I believe it's
best to stop any conversation that does not introduce new ideas.
I mentioned the two most important Linux Bugs to fix.
Let us continue after there is at least a hint that leads to a possible
fix for these bugs.
It makes no sense to waste my time while it is obvious that the Linux
kernel folks are completely missing any will to fix their bugs.
