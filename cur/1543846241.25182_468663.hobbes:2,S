It's possible. This switch between kmalloc() and vmalloc() was there in the 
original code, and I didn't feel safe ripping it out right now. We can always 
explore this approach too, however.
What is the origin and history of this particular code? (It's been there since 
at least 2.4.x.) Who put in the switch between the two allocators, and for 
what reason? Is that reason still valid?
