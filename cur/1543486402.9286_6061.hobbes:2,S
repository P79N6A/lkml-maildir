After a bit of tweaking i got the connectathon '99 nfs testsuite to  compile
using linux 2.2.1 and glibc 2.0 and glibc 2.1-pre.  I could not get the
"largefile" tests to compile.
The test gave had the following warnings:
==============================================================

Congratulations, you passed the locking tests!
==============================================================
Test setup:
F
client: SS10 2.2.1 SMP/glibc 2.0.???/egcs 1.1.1
server: i486 2.2.1-ac5/glibc 2.0.7/egcs 1.1.1
The question:  Are those warnings of any concern to us?
Yours,
  Dominik Kubla
PS. 2.2.0-pre7-ac4 used to reboot w/o OOPS during the 30MB read/write test.
    So things have definitely improved! I thought those who did all the
    work would like to know that. ;-)
