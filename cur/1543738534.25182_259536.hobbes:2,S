Hi,
I know this is not really the right place for asking general questions, 
but I have read the source and searched the web and LKML archives for 2 
days without much avail.
I am writing a driver for a research project, and need to be able to 
traverse all dirty buffers in the buffer cache, for this device. I have 
read through buffer.c and several other files a dozen times, but have 
not been able to pin down exactly how to get access to the buffer 
cache. If someone could point any files that I should look at, to get a 
pointer to all the dirty buffers associated with a device, I would be 
very happy.
Thank you very much for your help,
Can Sar
