True, forgot about this (not so) little detail.  In 9pixel-wide font 
modes, the 9th pixel for all chars is taken to be background, except for 
0xC0..0xDF, where (if enabled) the 9th column is a copy of the eighth.  
Basically this means my idea would work only in 8-pixel wide font modes 
(which are probably still used quite a bit, on laptops especially - I'm 
using a 100x40 video mode on my 800x600 LCD display with 8x15 font).

In framebuffer mode we should theoretically have no problem supporting any 
number of characters we want.  As long as we don't use direct video memory 
access thru vcs/vcsa were programs expect 8-bit characters we can keep 
even 16-bit (or 32) chars in memory (probably in unicode) - this of couse 
increases the size of the font we need to keep resident in memory, but 
we'd almost be rid of one level of font-mapping...
