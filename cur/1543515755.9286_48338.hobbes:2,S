Yes, usually "hardware handshaking" is on, for example on the other
computer on the other end of the link. Turning on DTR and RTS then
results in the other side finally being able to send e.g. the login
prompt.
As this is standard, no "serial communication" program bothers to do
this "by hand" as an extra. Moreover, suppose I have a link where I
just occasionally want to send a batch of data. The program I might
want to connect to the serial port might not even be a "serial
communication" program.

I'd think of an "stty" like flag. The problem is, you'll still toggle
the lines the first time, as the default needs to be compatible with
the current behaviour.
