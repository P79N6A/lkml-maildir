2.5.32-mm1 fixes some page allocation failures on 3.75 GB
quad xeon.  2.5.32 vanilla had a lot of these:
page allocation failure. order:0, mode:0x50
The page alloc failures began showing up in the first few minutes
of testing (dbench).  2.5.32 stopped responding after about 4
hours of testing.
2.5.32-mm1 has been testing for over 14 hours with no
page allocation failures.
2.5.32 didn't have page alloc failures on uniprocessor 384 MB 
machine during 22 hours of testing.
