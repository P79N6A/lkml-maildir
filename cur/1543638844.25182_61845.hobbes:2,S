Yup, sorry.  That test is wrong, and is slated to be fixed at some point.

A couple of ways.  The system call path can call sigio_handler to clear
out any pending IO.  The SIGIO that was trapped in the process will cause
another call to sigio_handler which won't turn up any IO, but I don't 
consider that to be a problem.
The kernel process can examine the signal pending mask of the process after
it has transferred SIGIO to itself.  This can be done either through 
/proc/<pid>/status or a ptrace extension, since we're happily postulating 
new things for it to do anyway.  If there is a SIGIO pending, it calls
sigio_handler.
Any other possibilities that you see?
