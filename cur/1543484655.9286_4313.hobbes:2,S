Alan's fix to the TLAN driver seems to work.  It will generate "TLAN:
Couldn't allocate memory for received data."  (at about 100Hz) when the
system gets maxed out, but will return to normal operation if the load
is reduced.
My application seems to have trouble with new connections after the fd
count gets high and then lowers.  Restarting the application fixes
things.  This might be an application problem (but I doubt it).  I
haven't been able to force an oops or panic.
Given my success so far, I pushed my luck and tried a different system
:->
This system is a Dell 4 way Xeon-1Mb, 2Gb RAM, AMI Megaraid 428 (with
16Mb and battery), version 0.93 driver, version 1.47 BIOS, 6 physical
disks arranged as 3 virtual disks, AIC7xxx for tape and CD, (2) Intel
eepro 100baseT.
One of the advantages of SMP is that you get an oops much faster :-).
The system experience less then 10 seconds of heavy load before hitting
this.  Probably over 5000 fds were in use.  There were no other messages
before the oops.  It went down too fast to write anything to syslog.
