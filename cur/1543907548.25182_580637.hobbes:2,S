They both take read locks, which means that they can take them
simultaneously. AFAICS, the deadlock can only occur if something manages
to insert a request for a write lock after nfs4_kill_renewd() takes its
read lock, but before nfs4_renew_state() takes its read lock:
1) nfs4_kill_renewd()		2) nfs4_renew_state()		3) somebody else
-------------------             ------------------		-------------
read lock
wait on (2) to complete
								write lock <waits on (1)>
				read lock <waits on (3),

however as I explained earlier, the only process that can take a write
lock is the reclaimer daemon, but we _know_ that cannot be running (for
one thing, the reference count on nfs_client is zero, for the other,
there are no superblocks).
