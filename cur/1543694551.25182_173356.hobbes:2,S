oh. this seems very confusing for me. extents crashed during readdir() syscall.
4k block may contain upto 60 entries with 60chars length. even if your dir was
larger I don't think it was >16k. so, I really do believe all the extents were
placed in inode body (zero tree depth). also, directory grows in linear manner
only. so, this code patch is very very simple and quite good tested. thus it 
really seems like a corruption, not an error in logic. let me cook a patch that
will show more info.  
also, it's very interesting how is it difficult to reproduce on your box?
thanks!
