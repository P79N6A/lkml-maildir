> Ok revised patch attached
Sweet - thanks.  I have one other small patch against the
cpuset patch I posted on lkml a week ago I guess now.
Next week, I expect to repost, against a current *-mm,
and I will include your revised patch, after I build and
test it along with my stuff.  Thanks.
The rest of this week is taken up with unrelated duties
for me.

Ok.
If you have any thoughts on the issue I raised at the end of
my previous message in this subthread, concerning numa policies
that get out of sync with their tasks cpuset, I'd be interested
to hear them.
