Subject: [PATCH] nohz: no softirq pending warnings for offline cpus
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Heiko Carstens <heiko.carstens@de.ibm.com>
After a cpu was taken down during cpu hotplug (read: disabled for interrupts)
it still might have pending softirqs. However take_cpu_down makes sure
that the idle task will run next instead of ksoftirqd on the taken down cpu.
The idle task will call tick_nohz_stop_sched_tick which might warn about
pending softirqs just before the cpu kills itself completely.
However the pending softirqs on the dead cpu aren't a problem because they
will be moved to an online cpu during CPU_DEAD handling.
So make sure we warn only for online cpus.
