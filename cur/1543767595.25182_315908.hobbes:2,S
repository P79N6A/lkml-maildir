Is there any logical reason to need longer than 46 days of
milliseconds? I mean, sure, we could support years in milliseconds,
but why  :) ? If you need longer, specify in seconds. Or add an
interface which does days :) I think it's perfectly reasonable to
constrain time units representative storage in the following manner:
seconds: unsigned int
milliseconds: unsigned int
microseconds: unsigned long
nanoseconds: u64
These are the assumptions I have made in my timeofday-based soft-timer
rework, for what it's worth.
I will look into all the math, though, as all the conversions need to
be accurate for my rework (to support existing interfaces).
Thanks,
Nish
