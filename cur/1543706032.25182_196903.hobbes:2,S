There are Opteron boxes which are not NUMA. Or rather they are NUMA, but only
have a single node. Some of the cheaper boards only connect the DIMM
slots to a single CPU, which gives you only a single node even with
two CPUs. One of the test machines I have here is of this type. 
It's also useful for testing on simulators.

I don't do anything special, it's all generic page_alloc.c logic.
