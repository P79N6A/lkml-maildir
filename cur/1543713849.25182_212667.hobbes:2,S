I don't see how you can go by the cost in syscall latency ... the real 
cost is not the time take to flush the cache, it's the impact of doing
so .... such microbenchmarks seems pointless. I'm not against 4/4G at all,
I think it solves a real problem ... I just think latency numbers are a 
bad way to justify it - we need to look at whole benchmark runs.
