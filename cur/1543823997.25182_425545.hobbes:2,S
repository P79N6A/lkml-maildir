Forget what I said. It's not that simple. __dev_mc_upload() is also
called from igmp6_group_added() (through dev_mc_add()). In this path,
there are two spin_lock_bh that are held:
igmp6_group_added(...)
    [...]
    spin_lock_bh(&mc->mca_lock);
    [...]
    dev_mc_add(...)
dev_mv_add(..)
    [...]
    spin_lock_bh(&dev->xmit_lock);
    [...]
    __dev_mc_upload(...)
We have actually seen this path being taken by adding a
    if (in_interrupt()) {
       printk("bad bad bad\n");
       dump_stack();
    }
in our myri10ge_send_cmd(...).
We are going to add a "sleepable" parameter to myri10ge_send_cmd() so
that only set_multicast_list() will use it with our previous udelay loop.
