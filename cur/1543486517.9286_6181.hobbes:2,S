Try running "make depend" again. It looks like you ran depend when the
tree was somewhere else, and then moved/copied it. .depend files contain
complete path names.

This is a unfortunate result of using recursive makefiles. Only fix
would be to rewrite the complete makefile system to use a single
makefile which knows about all subdirs.

all the reasons why this is a good idea. Unfortunately it is not too likely
in the near future for linux kernel, if at all.

make always visits all subdirectories, that is caused by the recursive
makes (see above), but it should only rebuild real dependencies. I assume
some of your problems are caused by your bogus .depend files.
