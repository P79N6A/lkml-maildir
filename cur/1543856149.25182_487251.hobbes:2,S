I don't know much about the mechanisms, but I suppose there could be one
of the following causes:
 - The IR DMA context was never set up for the respective channel in the
   first place.
 - The context was set up but the interrupt event masks weren't switched
   on, i.e. IntMask as per OHCI clause 6.2 and isoRecvIntMask as per
   clause 6.3.2.
 - The context and masks were set up, but then one or both of the masks
   were switched off again, similar to the bus reset bug which Robert
   reported:
