Kmemleak introduces some overhead but shouldn't be that bad.
DEBUG_SLAB also introduces an overhead by erasing the data in the
allocated blocks.
Note that if the allocated blocks are added to a list and never
removed, kmemleak won't be able to detect the leak as the objects are
stilled referred. In this case, you can only use DEBUG_SLAB_LEAK.
