Subject: [PATCH 17/21] Unionfs: Documentation update regarding overlapping branches and new lookup code
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/23/441

From: Erez Zadok <ezk@cs.sunysb.edu>
Added detailed comment and updated documentation to explain why overlapping
branches are disallowed, and better explain the cache coherency issues.
