Yes.  You wouldn't impose restrictions on modifying the software like
that, now would you?  Even though the GPL says you can't impose
further restrictions on modification and distribution.

As in, the license controls the software.  If a patent creates
restrictions that limit what you can do with the software, then that
is unrelated to the software license.
As in, the license controls the software.  If a discriminatory
contract limits what you can do with the software, then that is
unrelated to the software license.
As in, the license controls the software.  If I send you the source
code, but it happens to be protected by a key that only the hardware
can decode, and it won't decode for you, then that is unrelated to the
software license.
Is that so, really?

True.  But TiVO is still imposing further restrictions on how I can
modify the software stored in their device, while reserving that
ability to itself.  This is wrong.  This is not "in kind".  This is
not "tit-for-tat".  Tit-for-tat is: if they can, then I can too, and
if I can't, then they can't either.

That would be an unfortunate machine to have, but if Linux or some
other GPLed software was not shipped in it, then I don't see how this
is relevant to this discussion.  It's not about the hardware, it's
about the software in it, and about passing on the freedoms related
with it.
