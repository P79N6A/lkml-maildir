There is no such thing. the interface you're looking at is the feature
connector for the various expansion options for the sblive, either a
breakout box for a drive bay or one in another slot... it notched in an
odd location so you shouldn't be able to insert a properply blanked ide
cable...

it's not a disk interface at all given that consumer grade audio outputs
are pretty hot (+10DB in some cases) I wouldn't plug a disk into it...

that's a bad thing to assume, you're likely to cook either you disk or the
soundcard or both. it should have a little text that says feature
connector silk screened on it. a picture of an sblive with the digital i/o
breakout card that connects via the ribbon is at:

no pci soundcard I know of includes an ide controller at this point.
