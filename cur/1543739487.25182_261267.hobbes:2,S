Ok, it seems to be related to specific hardware. I tried loading the 
exact same modules on another box in the exact same order, no crash. The 
box is actually running nicely.
I'm busy compiling the kernel again, this time with a few debug options 
ticked.
As far as I saw 2 days ago, its when I load uhci-hcd that the problem 
manifests itself... this is the order the modules are loaded in...
snd, snd_als4000, crc32, sis900, psmouse, evdev, tsdev, agpgart, 
sis_agp, pci_hotplug, usbcore, ohci_hcd, ub, ehci_hcd, ieee1394, 
ohci1394, uhci_hcd
The OOPS is  triggered from loading uhci_hcd, so it could be ohci1394 
that creates the corruption. I've had problems with ohci1394 in 26.8.1 
aswell, I cannot load it, unload it, and reload it... generates a D 
state for the modprobe.
Any tips on how i can track down the offending line in source?
