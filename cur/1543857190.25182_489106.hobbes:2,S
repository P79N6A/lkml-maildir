The kernel.org mirroring has been really flaky lately.
If you have an account, you can use master.kernel.org to get things 
without mirroring delays.
And if not, I'd be happy to push to other places too, but the reason 
kernel.org tends to occasionally get slow at mirroring is probably because 
it does get a lot of traffic. So..
