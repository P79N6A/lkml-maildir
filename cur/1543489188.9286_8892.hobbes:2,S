Hold on. We seem to be talking at cross purposes here. What Dave
Miller is suggesting is to have LE the default, but allowed specific
mmap()ed regions to be accessed with BE. It would appear to me that
that wouldn't cause the ugliness that Linus is concerned about. All
the x86 compatibility isn't affected. Normal operation wouldn't be
affected either. Only applications specifically requiring this would
use this facility, and it shouldn't impact the user<->kernel interface
either (no mucking with ioctl() data).
That's why I'm asking Linus the question whether or not such a
solution (if supported by the hardware) is acceptable.

OK. Didn't realise that this was something sensitive.
