   I don't see any better explanation right now, so I guess we just revert 
   that thing.
   
The people seeing this don't happen to be on Serverworks chipsets
are they?
I've seen a bug on serverworks where back to back PCI config
space operations can cause some to be lost or corrupted.
Another theory is that some device just dislikes being given
a 0 in one of it's base registers, but somehow ~0 is ok :-)
