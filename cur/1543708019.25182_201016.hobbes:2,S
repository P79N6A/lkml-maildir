Hello!
I've got a little problem with XSeries machines, containing two identical
builtin Broadcom NIC's. Is there any chance to get some information, which one
of the two cards is the upper, and which one is the lower card?
I need this information, because I want to install a lot of these machines
automatically.
Thank you for every hint,
kind regards,
Andreas Hartmann
