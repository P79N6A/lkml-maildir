Hey Andre,
If you need any peyote, let me know.  I think what would be **REALLY**
entertaining is to get you at a ceremony on Indian Lands (so its legal) with
your keyboard and watch what happens.  No doubt, some very interesting code
would get written (and stragne emails).
Welcome back, brother.
:-)
Jeff
