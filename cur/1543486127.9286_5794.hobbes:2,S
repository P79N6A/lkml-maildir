Subject: 2.2.1-ac6 doesn't boot.

	The boot process get stalled just after detecting the
SCSI CDROMs; it detects all the devices, then identify the CDROMs
and then it waits forever, no error messages no warnings, nothing
just waits. I have no problems with 2.2.1-ac5.
	I have a Supermicro P6DGU with an onboard AIC7890 UW2,
I compiled the kernel with SMP enabled as I have two processors.
If you need more info ask me for it.
	And finally I would like to know if there are any plans
to include the devfs filesystem in the 2.2.x series? if not why
don't you include it in your -ac series?
	Thanks,
	- german
