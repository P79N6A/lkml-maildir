Sorry. I mean transmition errors, but of course log was full of "wakeup" 
messages.

2.6.21.1 is first kernel which I'm using at this device. Earlier it was 
WindowsCE terminal. It is hardware fault. Commenting out the code is my 
way to avoid "wakeup" messages in log, but I don't want to change anything 
in vanilla kernel. I'm lucky that NIC is working at all.
Thank You
