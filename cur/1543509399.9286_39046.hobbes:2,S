Hi all,
            I'm writing driver code for the card, which is having four
ethernet contollers.We attached IRQ to each device.
When interrupt is rised,one of  two different processes  to be called
depending on the contents of the INTERRUPT CAUSE
REGISTER.Linux is new to me.So, can I know how can I create two
processes(Is there any documentation for kernel threads)
and signal them whenever required(like VXWORKS).Can I do it in "bottom
half".If so how can?Educate me.
Thanks
kams
