JS,
Thanks for the further assistance!  I checked the configuration and found only thing missing was "Virtual Terminal" part.  
Now I enable both of them as kernel build-in support and rebuild kernel.  After copied bzImage to /boot and rebooted, I still got same result:
Loading 2.5.72 ......................................
uncompressing Linux ... Ok, booting the kernel.
Then it stopped, nothing comes out from screen.
There must be something else.  
Eddie
