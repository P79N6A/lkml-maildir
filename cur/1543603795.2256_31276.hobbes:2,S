dbench wants a very unfair vm behaviour. We must penalize all tasks
except one.  I measured a x2 slowdown after Linus introduced
mark_page_accessed after 2.4.10pre11 (but still it was faster than
pre10).
If you want patches to make dbench much faster I can provide them, just
ask, at the moment I just think dbench is a very bad benchmark. I can
implement a /proc/sys/vm/dbench if people wants to post nice numbers
without having to apply patches :).
I'd also like to know what you get using -aa instead of mainline, there
are a few changes that can make a difference in the numbers.
