The answer will differ depending whether (for example) you're being ICMP
flooded, SYN-flooded, hit with a mass of HTTP 'GET /' commands, hit with a mass
of HTTP commands that invoke a resource-intensive CGI like a database search,
and so on.
We'd really need to know what the traffic involved in the DDoS is in order to
be able to comment on memory usage.
