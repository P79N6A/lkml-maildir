I've added a "sleep 2" to the arch/ia64/Makefile ... and all my
non-deterministic problems appear to have gone away.
I don't seem this re-build everything problem.  I just tried
a "touch arch/ia64/kernel/efi.c ; make" and it only recompiled
that one file.  That's with the "sleep" in the Makefile, but I
can't imagine it affects this case.
Can you give more details on what you did?
