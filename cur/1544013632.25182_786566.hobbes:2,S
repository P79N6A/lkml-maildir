in fact, either could need it.
the callee could need it when IT does a global registration (for
example to get a device number) at the end of its sequence.
We'd want that registration to happen sequential (it's basically the
equivalent of a commit/retirement of the instruction in a CPU)
the caller could need it when it wants to wait for the async function
it kicked off.
so both make total sense to me.

I had that originally... (as I described in the first mail).. but had
no users of it in the places I converted.
I'm happy to just return it; it does make sense (that's why I did this
originally)....
