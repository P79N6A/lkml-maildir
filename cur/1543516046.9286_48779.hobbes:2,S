In this case you don't need the source code:
Do you have a really noisy drive with a slow seek time?
Then you would hear the difference:
- WinNT and Linux-fork sound 'round' with lots of threads/processes, and
the performance increases.
- Linux-multithread always sounds identical (1 thread or 64); the
performance doesn't change.
You don't need to be a rocket scientist to figure out that the cause is
the mmap semaphore, ie that Linux single threads the io for
multi-threaded applications.
Linux with multiple processes or WinNT reorder the disk io, and thus
they get faster with more processes/threads.

P.S.: if you prefer to look at the source, then compare Linux-fork and
Linux-multithread.
