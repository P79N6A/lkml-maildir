that's weird. Could you try the hack below and _remove_ the 
acpi_use_timer_override flag? The change should artificially cause the 
above 4 lines to appear again, in all cases.
This would test the following aspects of your theory: is this unknown 
side-effect of the the acpi_use_timer_override flag related to the timer 
setup sequence in io_apic_32.c? If not, then the difference most likely 
lies in the different ACPI setup sequence.
