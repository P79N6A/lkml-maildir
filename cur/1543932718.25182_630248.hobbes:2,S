I think your suspicions are very unlikely.  The patch only affects
proc_get_inode() - and looking at the patch backtrace, it looks like the
system is successfully past that already (it's unlikely that
proc_reg_read+0x60/0x74 would have been reached otherwise).
If my patch to procfs is wrong, it would affect all proc files and ought be
immediately detectable.
