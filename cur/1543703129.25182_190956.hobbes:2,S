The problem with backporting is that the 2.4 scsi layer is not hot-plug aware,
so while you can make the driver detect a newly inserted or removed HBA there's
no way to tell the SCSI midlayer.

This is horribly ugly, but not your faul.  Any chance you could hide
it into some macro ala megaraid_set_host_lock(adapter, host).
Also note that in 2.6 scsi_set_host_lock should and could easily be avoided,
just let your adapter->host_lock point to host->host_lock.

This needs error return checking.  Again this no regression from the previous
version, could you please fix it in the next update?
