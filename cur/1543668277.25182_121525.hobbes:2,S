I don't think it's really bad for system responsiveness.  I think the 
problem is just that the sample is too small.  The proof is that simply 
doing sleep_time %= HZ cures most of my woes.  WRT contest and it's 
io_load, applying even the tiniest percentage of a timeslice penalty per 
activation and no other limits _dramatically_  affects the benchmark 
numbers.  (try it and you'll see. I posted a [ugly but useful for 
experimentation] patch which allows you to set these things and/or disable 
them from /proc/sys/sched)
I'm trying something right now that I think might work.  I set 
MAX_SLEEP_AVG to 10*60*HZ , start init out at max, and never allow it to 
degrade.  Everyone else is subject to boost and degradation, with the 
maximum boost being MAX_SLEEP_AVG/20 (which is still a good long sleep, and 
the max that one sleep can boost you is one priority).  When you start a 
cpu hogging task, it should drop in priority just fine, and rapid context 
switchers shouldn't gain such an advantage.  We'll see.  Tricky part is 
setting CHILD_PENALTY to the right number such that fork()->fork() kind of 
tasks don't drop down too low and have to crawl back up.  Contest falls 
into this category.
Anyway, I think that inverting the problem might cure most of the symptoms ;-)
