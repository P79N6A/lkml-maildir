I gave up trying to update the in-kernel ftape version because I my updates 
didn't come through (that was before the 2.2 and again before the 2.4 kernels 
were released). There are more pleasant wastes of time than to try to go 
through a one-man super-maintainer's eye of a needle.
Actually, the in-kernel version of ftape should be replaced or deleted, it is 
damn outdated anyway and buggy.
In principle, there were some attempts to elect a new ftape-maintainer some 
time ago (Roby Basak, if I remember right).
I could provide a kernel patch for 2.4 and 2.6 to update the in-kernel version 
of ftape if that is wanted.
Otherwise I'd suggest to remove me from the maintainer's list and/or delete 
ftape from the kernel source tree.
Greetings
Claus
