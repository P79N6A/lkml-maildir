Hi list,
I'm curious about the /sys/kernel/ namespace. I had presumed that
it is intended to replace /proc/sys/ basically with the same
functionality. I _assume_ these are system software stats and
tunables that are not exactly linked to device drivers (OTOH,
where do you draw the line? eg. Would filesystems go here? Core
network algorithm tunables might, but per interface ones probably
not...).
I don't know. Is there guidelines for sysfs (and procfs for that
matter)? Is anyone maintaining it (not the infrastructure, but
the actual content)?
It's kind of ironic that /proc/sys/ looks like one of the best
organised directories in proc, while /sys/kernel seems to be in
danger of becoming a mess: it has kexec and uevent files in the
base directory, rather than in subdirectories...
