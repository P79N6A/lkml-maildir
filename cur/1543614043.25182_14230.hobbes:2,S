Apart from the clock differences (which if actually presented to the two
cpus would cause the TSC to drift apart cause who knows what mayhem)
what is the real difference?  I think you would have to make sure you
configure for the subset of chip capabilities so you don't find the
system trying to use some capability that is only present on one cpu and
then switching the ap to the other.  As I recall, someone has already
explored this turf to some extent.  Check the archives.
But really, I was wondering what you thought needed to be done in
software?
