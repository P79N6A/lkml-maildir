I know you understand English, Pavel! Re-read what I wrote previously! The 
problem is a race. You're telling processes that process I/O to freeze at the 
same time as you're telling processes that submit I/O to freeze. If kjournald 
(eg) enters the refrigerator while dd is still running, dd is going to have a 
chance of getting stuck, waiting for some I/O to complete.
This also means your sys_sync is totally useless if anything is submitting 
I/O, since there will still be I/O being submitted after the sync is done. 
This is why (in the numbers I submitted yesterday), the current 
implementation took so much longer than the new one. The sys_sync really only 
introduces a big delay. It needs to be done after the things that generate 
I/O have been stopped.
Regards,
Nigel
