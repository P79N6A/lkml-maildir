somebody is holding a reference to your device, either through your 
modules use of the MOD_INC_USE_COUNT macro (which I believe is 
depricated), or through the use of one of the macros that the kernel 
uses to prevent module remove race conditions (dev_hold is the only one 
that jumps to mind at the moment).  You can only get the module to 
remove by balancing the MOD_INC/DEC macros, or massaging your kernel to 
release any references to your module.  However, after an oops, its 
usually best practice to reboot, lest you run a kernel with corrupted 
memory somewhere.

I don't believe you call the operation in a pci_ops structure directly. 
  check the kernel for references to 
pci_[read|write]_config_[byte|word|dword] instead.
