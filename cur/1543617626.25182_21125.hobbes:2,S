The definition of "behavioral change" you're implying here is so narrow that
if I interpreted the "agreement" that way", CML2 could do nothing worthwhile.

The danger (where there is any) from armed citizens, is only to the
*government*, not to *society*; and as long as they have nothing to
revenge in the government (which they cannot have while it is in their
own hands) there are many advantages in their being accustomed to the 
use of arms, and no possible disadvantage.
