This could be easily arranged with the new input drivers with it modular
design. Since for the ix86 platform most people will want PS/2 input
support to be built in. The only expection are the USB only users. I guess
with the Dell Latitude C600 we will have to force i8042.c to be built in. 
Vojtech what do you think about this solution?
