Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Greetings Linus,
Since __exit and __exit_call from init.h use __attribute_used__ from compiler.h
and are two of the most common macros for which files include init.h, init.h
should include compiler.h.
I think this patch would be appropriate anyway, but note the patch "Make
net/ipx/ipx_proc.c compile w/o CONFIG_PROC_FS", which I have CC-ed to all
recipients of this message, and that depends upon this patch.  Without this
patch, ipx_proc.c would need to include both init.h and compiler.h, the latter
for no other reason than to support init.h.  I don't think that's good.
Thanks,
Noah
