Hi,
Kay eased my task by enumerating all issues I have with Greg's
approach. Not all the world is udev and not all class devices have
"/dev" represetation so haveing one program being able to understand
new sysfs hierarchy is not enough IHMO.
However I do not think that "moving" class devices into /sys/devices
hierarchy is the right solution either because one physical device
could easily end up belonging to several classes. I recenty got an
e-mail from Adam Belay (whom I am pulling into the discussion)
regarding his desire to rearrange net/wireless representation. I think
it would be quite natural to have /sys/class/net/interfaces and
/sys/class/net/wireless /sys/class/net/irda, and /sys/class/net/wired
subclasses where "interfaces" would enumerate _all_ network interfaces
in the system, and the rest would show only devices of their class.
