Yes. Running fsx directly on my ext3 /home partition gets me the
BUG within a few seconds, with the exact same backtrace as below.
There don't seem to be any jbd changes from -rc1 to final 2.4.22,
so I assume the problem exists in 2.4.22 as well.
Box survives a night of memtest86, so I figure it's not a memory
problem.
