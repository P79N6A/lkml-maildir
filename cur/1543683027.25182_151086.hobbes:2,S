Is this something for the kernel config? Just below CONFIG_EXPERIMENTEL 
in the menu, add CONFIG_OBSOLETE. The 'make allyesconfig' and the like 
can ignore experimental and obsolete stuff.
This would make a reasonable Q-requirement for 2.6.0 that at least the 
kernel compiles with 'make allyesconfig'. The only thing open is to 
decide what is obsolete and what not (and needs fix). That is not 
trivial. IMHO, Linus some time ago had a good statement about it, but it 
is somewhat hard to see how long something is broken from the code alone :-)
If this is a good idea, I'll supply a patch for 2.6.0-something with at 
least some non-compiling stuff marked obsolete.
Regards,
Bas.
