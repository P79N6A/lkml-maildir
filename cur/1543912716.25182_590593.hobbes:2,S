absolutely agreed.  but in cases like that, it might just be easier to
not tag that feature *at all*.  nothing in this proposal *forces*
someone to start tagging kernel features in any way.  as you point
out, there may be cases where trying to tag a feature becomes so
hopelessly vague and special-cased, it's easier to just leave it
alone.  but that still doesn't take away from the value of being able
to use this construct elsewhere where its use *is* clear-cut and
unambiguous.
it's like the current use of "EXPERIMENTAL" -- choosing to see
features that are EXPERIMENTAL doesn't change the build process in any
way -- it just affects the choices you're allowed to make.  it doesn't
*force* you to *take* any of those choices.  that's all this new
construct is supposed to do as well.

p.s.  if i read simon's earlier patch correctly, all it's doing right
now is allowing assignment of attributes and values to kernel features
-- it does nothing in terms of being able to use that feature in the
config process.  that would be step two, after this first step is
added and seems to be correct.
