Clean file backed pages dominate memory on most boxes. They can be 
calculated by NR_FILE_PAGES - NR_FILE_DIRTY
On my 2G system that is 
Cached:        1731480 kB
Dirty:             424 kB
So for most load the patch as is will fix your issues. The problem arises 
if you have extreme loads that are making the majority of pages anonymous.
We could change min_free_kbytes to specify the number of free + clean 
pages required (if we can do atomic reclaim then we do not need it 
anymore). Then we can specify a large portion of memory for 
min_free_kbytes. 20%? That would give you 400M on my box which would 
certainly suffice.
If the amount of clean file backed pages falls below that limit then do 
the usual reclaim. If we write anonymous pages out to swap then they 
can also become clean and reclaimable.
