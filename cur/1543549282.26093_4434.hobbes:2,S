I have the same problem.  Boot from raid-1 on a Tekram LVD controller,
and have an
adaptec with an old cdrom and sometimes a disk too.  The adaptec
is detected first.
But there is an easy fix: Compile the boot controller into the kernel,
and let the other controller be modular.  Compiled-in controllers
always go before modular.
Ideally I'd like specifying controller order in menuconfig.  Perhaps a
"controller order" submenu in scsi, that display the default order
of the selected controllers.  The user can then change this.
I guess that is 2.5 stuff though.
