Yes of course.  I've seen the compressed page cache patch do this and
get fair peformance (10-20%), though on double size blocks (8KiB) it
manages almost twice as good (20-50%, averaged around 30% IIRC).  Not
great, but not bad.
On compressed filesystems you can work with 64k or 128k blocks.
Somewhere around 32-64k is usually optimal; you're not going to see
great improvements using 1M blocks instead of 512k blocks.

Yes, an intelligent algorithm decides that if the underlying compression
algorithm used produces no results, it just marks the block as
uncompressed and stores it as such.  ZLIB does this if the block gets
bigger.  LZMA might not; but higher level intrinsics (block headers)
could handle that easy (as you said).
