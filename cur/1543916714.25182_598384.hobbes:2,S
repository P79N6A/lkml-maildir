Poke around for Alan Cox's cleanup of this area of linux/ata.h.
It converts several macros to inline functions (encouraged), and also 
illustrates a nice, clean way of testing an ID word's validity. 
[obviously the final implementation varies, depending on that ID word's 
history]
Alan or Andrew, got a copy somewhere?  My feeble search skills don't 
seem to turn it up at the moment, even though I had a copy in my hands 
quite recently.
