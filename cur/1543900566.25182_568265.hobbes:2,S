Ah, so this is why you want ->next in preempt hooks.  Well, my plan for
this sort of thing (for kvm has the same issues with the *STAR family of
msrs) is to add a new hook on switching from kernel to userspace, and
swap those msrs there.  This allows not only the guest1->guest2 case to
be optimized, but also guest->kthread->guest, which is a common pattern
with I/O (and very common with -rt, which runs interrupts in threads).
