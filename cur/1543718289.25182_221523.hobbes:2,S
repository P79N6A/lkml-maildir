sorry if I did not follow this thread from the beginning, but why is distcc 
causing a BUG() in page_alloc.c? I use distcc since I don't know when and 
never had any BUG() in page_alloc with distcc, nor the specific bug at :98.
I have 7 machines in my distcc farm, and all are "remote controlled".
Could someone please clarify me? Thank you.
ciao, Marc
