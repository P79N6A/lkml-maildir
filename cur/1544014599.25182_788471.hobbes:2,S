I wasn't talking about man pages.  I already quoted the section from the
Single Unix Specification version 3 (which supersedes POSIX) that
explicitly says leap seconds are ignored (despite sometimes heated
disagreement, as seen repeated here).  The standard "seconds since the
epoch" is seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC but not including leap
seconds (00:00:00 UTC is always 86400*n seconds since the epoch).
As long as Linux wants to work like all the other POSIX systems (which
it should unless there is huge advantage in doing otherwise), time(),
gettimeofday(), etc., all must work without leap seconds.
