No, XFS does not do this, when it gets asked to write out a page which is
delayed alloc, it goes and converts the delayed alloc extent to real disk
space. It then uses the page cache/buffer heads to find all the contiguous
pages which it can turn into a singe disk I/O. The code is made more complex
by other possible states for the data. The only information internal to XFS
though is its extent structures.
