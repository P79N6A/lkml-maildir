Well, OK, but the next question is that is some form of panel of
outsiders still a useful feature?
Previous panels we've done have been:
      * Device Drivers - Inputs from vendors trying to get code into the
        kernel.  I had feedback that this was reasonably useful; the
        problem is that it tends to be composed of vendors already
        making a big effort on the open source process and not the ones
        (like graphics) who aren't.
      * Customer Panel - inputs from various users deploying linux in
        their enterprises.  This did tend to degenerate quickly to a
        list of requirements.
The one everyone seems to want is chipsets, so is this the one we want
to shoot for this year?
