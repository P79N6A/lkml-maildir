There seems to be a weird bug with /proc/meminfo or maybe the kernel is
using memory differently now or something.  Anyway, I first noticed that
may memory usage seemed REALLY low, like less than 20% of my 128MB with
X and Gnome running, which seemed quite odd.  Figuring memory usage
didn't drop by THAT much from previous kernels, I checked /proc/meminfo.
Its telling me I have 0 bytes of shared memory.   I would think there
are some shared libs somewhere.  I can post the values later if no one
else notices this (I'm not at home), but could someone verify that
/proc/meminfo looks weird?
Could be related in any way to the odd random oopes that people are
getting?
