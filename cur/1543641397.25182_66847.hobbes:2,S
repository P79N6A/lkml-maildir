Yes. However, I certainly wouldn't mind having the same interfaces as 
everybody else to set things like "aggressive" vs "powersave". Transmeta 
does all the actual _work_ behind the OS's back, but you can still tell 
the CPU what policy to take, and what frequency limits to use.

Absolutely.

...with user mode input (ie user mode can know a lot of high-level stuff
that the kernel _doesn't_ know). So the kernel does potentially need user
input on policy.
