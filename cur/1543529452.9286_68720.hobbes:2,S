I needed these changes to make 2.3.51 go:

 		}
This was changed in 2.3.48 but that change is wrong, at least I get wrong
results in fp-calculations.
Could the one who changed this please comment on it?

Simple compilation fix. RAID 0 apparently works here.

Compilation fix. Don't know whether em86 works.
This is an Alpha AXPpci33 ev4 machine. gcc 2.95.2.
