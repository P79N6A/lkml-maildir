Ok, another potential problem then :
If we fast-path the num_online_cpus == 1, then updates done after the
boot process will have to go through this code. Therefore, we would have
to disable interrupts in the early boot code.
However, I doubt it is safe to use the paravirtualized
local_irq_disable/enable before the paravirt code is executed ?
