Nah. Do it right:
Internet ----- Firewall ---- SSL Accelerator Box --+---- Webserver
         HTTPS          HTTPS                      | HTTP
                                                   |
                                                  IDS
Check out the boxes from SonicWall, they're quite nice. Expensive,
though. If your E-Commerce site can't afford them, well, then they
shouldn't be able to affore a security consulant in the first
place. :-)
