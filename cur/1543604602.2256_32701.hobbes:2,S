I've been reading throught the APM spec and code a bit further. The more
I read the more I wonder quite how our idle code is meant to work and what
kind of beer was overconsumed during its writing.
There are two glaring issues I can see right now
#1	The BIOS might sleep for a tick, but it is also is allowed to slow
	the cpu and return straight back to us.
	If it returns back to us we spin in a tight loop at the lower clock
	speed calling the APM bios. Not ideal.
	Just fixed that in my tree for the next -ac
#2	We test system_idle() nr_running==1, but we spent all our time 
	pretending we aren't running. Im not 100% sure the test is safe
	yet
