BINGO! And that's what we're complaining about.

Again, THIS is the problem. They shouldn't be outstanding. They should be
out there, in the standard kernel. If they work, they work. If they don't,
we find out. And if they don't work, then others can at least help. Right
now, if they don't work, people usually don't even know, because the
people for whom the old driver is fine will never even bother to try your
internal test-of-the-day-driver.
Resulting in that when you _do_ think it's fine, it isn't. And at that
point it's too dang hard to tell exactly what it was that broke.
The problem may be that you want to maintain a heck of a lot of drivers,
and maybe you should try to delegate a bit, so that you can give the
drivers you _really_ want to work on the priority they deserve.
