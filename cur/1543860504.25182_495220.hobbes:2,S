This should be stressed, IMHO. We have too many macros which have no
reason to live.

When giving two alternatives, the reader will thank you if you explain
when each should be used. In this case, the second form should be used
when the macro needs to return a value (and you can't use an inline
function for whatever reason), whereas the first form should be used
at all other times.
