for one, i'm using a modified version of the network FIFO queue discipline 
to inject "delay" and "drop", similar to what ippipe can do on FreeBSD.
given i'm using a kernel timer for this, HZ >= 1000 is essential for <1.5 
millisecond accuracy.
perhaps we really need a high-speed timer mechanism for parts of the kernel 
that require it (or a highly-accurate single-fire timer)?
cheers,
lincoln.
