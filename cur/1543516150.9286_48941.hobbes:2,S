I always suspected that, but it's hard to be sure - the guy was even  
named, but I forget who it was.

Actually, any character you wanted. I think the syscall for this got  
mangled into unusability around DOS 6, and COMMAND.COM stopped using it  
after 3.x.

... in COMMAND.COM. You could always use it in the syscalls.

I saw the code for this in 3.x, but I think I couldn't figure out how to  
activate it.
DOS contains a heap of dead code. From looking at the Caldera-M$ suit,  
Windoze is even worse.

It's legal in all versions of Windoze, too. Also was legal in OS/2, IIRC.
I remember when OS/2 2.0 came out, all people talking about those illegal  
filenames "EA DATA.something" that CHKDSK wouldn't remove. Well, duh -  
those were perfectly legal FAT filenames, and always had been. You just  
couldn't access them with the COMMAND.COM command line parser. (And you  
could remove them the same way the FAQs say about Unix filenames with  
weird characters.)
