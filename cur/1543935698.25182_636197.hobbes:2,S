COW is not that hard to handle, you just need to be notified of moving
blocks. If you view the patch as just a tighter integration between loop
and fs, I don't think it's necessarily that broken.
I did consider these cases, and it can be done with the existing
approach.

That does sound like a nice approach, but a lot more work. It'll behave
differently too, the advantage of what I proposed is that it behaves
like a real device.
I'm not asking you to love it (in fact I knew some people would complain
about this approach and I understand why), just tossing it out there to
get things rolling. If we end up doing it differently I don't really
care, I'm not married to any solution but merely wish to solve a
problem. If that ends up being solved differently, the outcome is the
same to me.
