The current ones are, but future ones will surely be based on future
cores (i.e. I suspect we will see Northwood-based Celerons, soon) and
this option will be applicable to those, too.
More importantly, the consumer name is just "Celeron" i.e. the box does
not mention the core or anything.  The best I think we can offer is
"P4-based Celeron" which is a nice blanket name.
