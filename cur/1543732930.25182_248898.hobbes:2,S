The kernel is NOT in sole control today on ARM platforms:

Sure, we have a weird naming scheme (red, green, amber, blue) but
that came around because that's what people were dealing with.
There's nothing really stopping us from having any name for a LED
in the existing scheme.
I just don't buy the "we must have one sysfs node for every LED"
argument.
