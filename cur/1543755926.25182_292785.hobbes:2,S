So far , the only place I can find a 0xA5 is  under the PS/2 Keyboard numbers and scan codes.
KeyNumber   Set 1 Make/Break     Set 2 Make/Break   Set 3 Make/Break   Base Case   Uppercase
38                  25/A5                        42/F0 42                 42/F0 42                 k                  K
I am not familiar with how PS/2 uses it scan code. Unlike the AT it only have one Scan code to a Key Number.
