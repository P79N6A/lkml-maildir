I'm still waiting to hear if it fixes the problem. In the meantime, here
is a slightly cleaner version, that also fixes most of those "unexpected
un/lock status" messages.

NLM: Ensure we do not Oops in the case of an unlock
In theory, NLM specs assure us that the server will only reply LCK_GRANTED
or LCK_DENIED_GRACE_PERIOD to our NLM_UNLOCK request.
In practice, we should not assume this to be the case, and the code will
currently Oops if we do.
