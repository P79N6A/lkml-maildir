in any case, i'm quite confortable about your patch now, because it just
fits into the thinking that is behind the current boosting concept. So
it's not a random tweak added here or there (like the iopl() boost), it's
an extension of the core interactivity concept, and as such it cannot have
bad effects, unless the core concept is faulty. (which i dont think it
is.)
