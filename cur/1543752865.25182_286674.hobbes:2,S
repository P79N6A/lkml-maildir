gcc is a very good hardware checker. :)
I had a gcc crashing problem. Turned out to be RAM
timing problem. memtest86 wasn't able to trigger it
for me in overnight runs. gcc does it in seconds -
if you find a "magic" set of compile options and source file.
As you correctly noticed, yu have more chances of hitting
magic in large compiles.
I grabbed crashed gcc's command line from make log
and ran it in endless loop.
I had a crash (SIGSEGV due to mangled pointer) with ~10%
probability.
