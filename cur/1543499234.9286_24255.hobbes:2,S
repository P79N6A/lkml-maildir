The only fundamental difference I can see between Ted's proposal and
the current scheme is that Ted's reflects physical properties while
yours reflects kernel properties (the driver structure).  This vaguely
implies that Ted's scheme is less likely to change with kernel changes.
It doesn't seem that the difference is a major issue, but if something
could be done about it, it would probably be good.
