Not true at all.  If you can do it with a block device, you can do it 
with a SCSI block device.
In fact, SCSI should make a few things easier, because the notion of 
host+bus topology is already present, and notion of messaging is already 
present, so you don't have to recreate that in a Xen block device 
infrastructure.

This I'll grant you.
