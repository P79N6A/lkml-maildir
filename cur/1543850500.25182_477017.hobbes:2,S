How can sata be initialised after swsusp?  Are they each using correctly
prioritised initcall levels?
If so then the problem is presumably that sata initialisation is started
before swsusp initialisation, but sata completes _after_ swsusp
initialisation has run.  In which case the as-yet-untested
drivers-wait-for-threaded-probes-between-initcall-levels.patch should fix
this.
Greg, I think I'll send vmlinuxlds-consolidate-initcall-sections.patch into
Linus for 2.6.19, make things easier for everyone.
I'll send both patches.  Please test ;)
