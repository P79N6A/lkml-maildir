Andrea, et al,
I do not wish to start a religious war about data structures.  Have you considered
the relatively new data structure called a 'skip list'?  I have replaced several
subsystems in our system at work that would have been ready candidates for AVL or
RB trees (or any of a cast of thousands of others) with skiplists to very good
effect in insertion, deletion and search speed.  I would be happy to supply
pointers if you're interested.  The code is trivial compared to any other tree
management scheme I know.  Skiplists maintain balance and give O(log2 N)
performance for insert, delete AND search.  There are variants that have no
pathologically bad performance under any circumstances.  However, I believe it's
pretty safe to use the statistically "good" versions rather than slighly slower
overall and more complicated but garanteed behavior ones for the purposes you're
talking about.
