DEF_TIMESLICE is a value used for smp balancing and has no effect on quota so 
I doubt you mean that value. The quota you're describing of not resetting is 
something like the sleep average idea of current systems where you accumulate 
bonus points by sleeping when you would be running and redeem them later. 
This is exactly the system I'm avoiding using in rsdl as you'd have to decide 
just how much sleep time it could accumulate, and over how long it would run 
out, and so on. ie that's the interactivity estimator. This is the system 
that destroys any guarantee of cpu percentage, and ends up leading to periods 
of relative starvation, is open to tuning that can either be too short or too 
long depending on the values you chose and so on.

That is not really feasible to implement. How can you guarantee latencies when 
the system is overloaded? If you have 1000 tasks all trying to get scheduled 
in say 10ms you end up running for only 10 microseconds at a time. That will 
achieve the exact opposite whereby as the load increases the runtime gets 
shorter and shorter till cpu cache trashing and no real work occurs.
