Subject: working sata_vsc driver with 2.6.20?

I'm having a hell of a time with the sata_vsc driver with 2.6.20...
2.6.21 works fine --but the driver is radically different -- is there
a method to build the 2.6.21 driver against 2.6.20?
There are a number of patches on the 2.6.20 sata driver
(it works on a PC platform, but fails with our embedded ppc board).
It seems there was a regression loss from 2.6.19 to 2.6.20 -- but I can't
easily build the 2.6.19 driver against 2.6.20...
Where is the definitive 2.6.20 sata_vsc driver?
