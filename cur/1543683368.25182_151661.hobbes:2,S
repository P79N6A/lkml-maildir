No, it would just leak memory.  Not really a concern for developers.
It's fairly trivial to hack up a backdoor "remove all freed modules
and be damned" thing for developers if there's real demand.

I already have a poisoning patch for init code, when some modules
seemed to suffer from this being discarded.  I can extend it.
Thanks!
