If you go thus far... then I think, that the Configure.help stuff should 
be embedded inside the driver source code
itself. Like for example the postfix MTA code is embedding whole *man* 
pages there. And  *man* pages would be
anyway a more appriopriate and classical place where the current 
Configure.help information should be.
Just lift the code over from there (The extraction is even proper awk 
insead of some perl crap...) and be nearly done.
