Confinement in its traditional sense (e.g. the 1973 Lampson paper, ACM
Vol 16 No 10) means information flow control, which you have agreed
AppArmor does not and cannot provide.  Yes?  As to the (genuine)
capability-based systems, have a look at the DTOS General System
Security and Assurability Assessment Report for why we have concerns
with their approach.  But that has nothing to do with AppArmor.
Look, if you would just refrain from making misleading statements about
SELinux (not only in this FAQ but throughout your documents and talks),
especially when we've previously refuted those same statements (as in
the first AppArmor submission and its discussion), and honestly
acknowledged the limitations of your approach without trying to spin
them as strengths, I think that there would be nothing to discuss here.
We could just agree to disagree, and you could just focus on addressing
the issues raised by the vfs folks about how to get your changes into an
acceptable form.
