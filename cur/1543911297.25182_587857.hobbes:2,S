Oops.  If seems that both drivers/char/hpet.c and arch/x86_64/kernel/hpet.c
both register a clocksource named "hpet".  Probably a result of bringing
back to life a long lost patch, and having someone else (John Stultz, according
to git blame) make a similar change to a different file in the intervening
time.
Presumably the thing to do would be merge the x86_64 specific version
into the drivers/char/hpet.c version?
