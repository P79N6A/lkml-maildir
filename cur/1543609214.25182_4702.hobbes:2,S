The task register is only pure, not const. It's true that it's only
initialized during cpu_init(), but different cpus in the system have
different task register values.
	get_TR();
	schedule();
	get_TR();
must reload the task register.
But the value of "current" can be considered as const: It never changes
for a running thread. The exception are fork() and clone(), but both
functions directly call asm code and run on a fresh stack after forking.

I think get_current should be inline, const. get_TR() and
smp_processor_id would be inline, pure.
