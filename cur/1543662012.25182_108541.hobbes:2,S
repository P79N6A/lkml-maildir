The original code has the property that apic_pm_state.active is
true if and only if detect_init_APIC() was called and succeeded,
which implies that apic_phys == mp_lapic_addr == APIC_DEFAULT_PHYS_BASE.
You can also see that apic_pm_resume() writes APIC_DEFAULT_PHYS_BASE
to MSR_IA32_APICBASE, which only makes sense in this situation.
You moved the apic_pm_state.active = 1 assignment from detect_init_APIC(),
which is specific to UP_APIC, to setup_local_APIC(), which is called
also in the SMP case. Do you intend to do suspend and resume on SMP boxes
as well? If this is intensional, shouldn't device_apic be per-cpu?
