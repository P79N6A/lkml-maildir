Ok I wasn't aware of that earlier.
Does it really work on a recent kernel (as in .23 or .24-rc)? I have my doubts 
especially since  the default_ldt is gone it will be probably difficult for 
an external module to implement the lcall7 and lcall27 entry points.
<reads code> Ok it seems to load its own GDT and IDT. With that lcall
might still work. It's unclear how it works on SMP and how TLS rewriting
still works. But you don't really expect us to support any kernel modules who 
do such hacks, do you? This thing is likely pure race country anyways. I hope
nobody uses it in production.
Anyways what it could still do is to register an own copy or wrapper of the 
ELF loader that is registered before the normal binfmt_elf and then
checks for its own flavour of ELF and handles that and passes all
other binaries on.
I stand by my earlier point that it doesn't make sense to have all
Linux kernels always execute these strcmps.
