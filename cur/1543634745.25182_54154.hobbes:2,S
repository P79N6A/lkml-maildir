Hi,
Is there any possibility we could:
1)  Add support to the boot/mounting process 
    so that, if a machine is being powered by
    battery, EXT3 partitions are mounted with
    EXT2, instead?
2)  While the machine is running, notice when the
    power source switches between AC and battery
    or vice versa and remount partitions EXT3
    partitions to use EXT2 whenever a battery is
    being used?
This could save laptop users a lot of power,
while keeping the benefits of EXT3 when AC
power is available.
I know that this can be accomplished with more
direct user intervention, but I am hoping a more
general and transparent solution can be created.
