I don't think any drastic reorganization is even necessary.
Mariusz Mazur <mmazur@kernel.pl> updates 
http://ep09.pld-linux.org/~mmazur/linux-libc-headers/
 for each 2.6.x 
kernel release.  linux-libc-headers are the kernel headers, with all the 
kernel-specific stuff stripped out.  i.e. userland ABI only.  Not sure 
how many distros have started picking that up yet...  I think Arjan said 
Fedora Core had, or would.
If people want to go beyond that, IMHO it would be simple and easy to 
start putting new kernel headers in include/kernel (or somesuch).  That 
way there are no massive reorganizations; kernel-specific stuff gets 
slowly migrated to a kernel-specific area.
