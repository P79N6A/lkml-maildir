First off one has to distinguish between ATA TCQ and SCSI TCQ. ATA TCQ 
is essentially abandoned, very few drives and fewer still controllers 
and matching drivers ever supported it.
SCSI TCQ has "head of queue", "ordered" and "simple" queueing modes. ATA 
NCQ effectively only has "simple" where the drive always decides what 
order to service the requests in. There is a FUA mode, which tells the 
drive that the command (normally a write) has to access the physical 
media before reporting completion.

There are cases where writes need to complete in a specific order. This 
can be done either by using FUA bits (though libata doesn't do this by 
default currently) or by issuing cache flushes before and after certain 
commands.

That's a big part of it. The kernel doesn't necessarily know what 
sectors will be the fastest to access at any given time whereas the 
drive can.
Also, NCQ has some other improvements that are independent of actually 
queueing commands - for instance, because the drive controls the DMA 
data transfer, it can transfer the data for one request in an 
out-of-order fashion instead of having to transfer to the host strictly 
from beginning to end as in traditional ATA.

I believe that they're essentially the same in that regard, though 
someone can correct me if I'm wrong..
