The underlying issue here is the notion of security mechanisms which are 
built as loadable modules.  It's not useful for any in-tree users, and 
introduces several unnecessary problems which then need to be addressed.
A better approach would be to make LSM a statically linked interface.
This would also allow us to unexport the LSM symbols and reduce the API 
abuse by third-party modules.
