Hello,
I noticed that the amount of memory used by the Linux kernel steadily
increases over time on SMP systems (x86 architecture, 32-bit kernel).
This problem disappears when I add maxcpus=1 to the kernel command
line. I have observed this behavior both on the 2.6.22.18 and 2.6.24.2
kernels. Did anyone notice anything similar ?
