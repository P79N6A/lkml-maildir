Doh.  The small (~5us) clock decrements were the work of xntpd.  I
thought it worked by reducing the size of the forward tick, but
apparently not.  Oh well.
Still, with xntpd off, stock 2.2.9 gives me large (~10-100ms) time
decrements quite frequently when running the XiG 5.0 server and
scrolling in Netscape.
I tried forcing the use of do_slow_gettimeoffset() in
arch/i386/kernel/time.c, but that only reduced my gettimeofday() count
from about 900k/sec to 120k/sec, without fixing the time warps.
Next, I changed do_fast_gettimeoffset() so that it'd only do the TSC
calculation if the same CPU that had done the timer_interrupt was
doing the do_gettimeofday (if a "wrong" CPU was doing it, it would
just use the last offset that the "right" CPU returned).  Still, no
dice.  Then I had do_fast_gettimeoffset() just return
delay_at_last_interrupt in all cases, but that was worse: I got warps
of +/-4295 seconds (!) (so I guess delay_at_last_interrupt was
frequently negative).  Finally, I put a "return 0;" at the beginning
of do_fast_gettimeoffset(), and everything works great.  So far.
I'm copying linux-smp on this in hopes that somebody who knows about
the "delay_at_last_interrupt" calculation can shed some light here.
Thanks again for your help with this!
