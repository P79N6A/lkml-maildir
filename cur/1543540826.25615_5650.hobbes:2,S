correction - the story below is from 2.4.0-test6-pre2. Now, in
2.4.0-test6-pre5 it seems to work fine when both ne and isapnp are
statically linked. The card is now (by itself, probably
assisted by some reboots into Windows, FreeBSD, Solaris and
UnixWare (or maybe BIOS did it?) in the meantime) permanently migrated to
io=0x220 and irq=5.
So, it all works now and whosoever remembers the past shall lose his eyes
(or so the russian saying goes).

Tigran
