I think 2 improvement is not exclusive.
your patch is nice, but we need David's patch too. 
because 2 patch purpose is different.
per superblock lru:   improve typical performance.
limit of unused list: prevent too long hang up.
many time hang up happend at worst case even introduce per superblock lru.
and
unused list traversal doesn't improvement even introduce limit of unused list.
I hope both.

good luck.

Why don't you make sysctl adjustable interface of dentry_unused_ratio?
