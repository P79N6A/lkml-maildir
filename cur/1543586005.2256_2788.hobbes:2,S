Every few weeks, since switching to 2.4.2, I get a series of 'NETDEV
WATCHDOG' errors. When this happens the system becomes unusable (homes
are NFS mounted) and does not recover. A small number of packets do get
out when it's in this state, but not enough to be useful. I've tried an
ifconfig up/down, all that seems to help is a reboot. The 3c905C driver
is compiled into my kernel, so I can't reload it. The machine is a Dell
Precision 220 (only one processor installed).
Has anyone else seen this problem. Is their a way to reset the interface
without rebooting? Any ideas?
                    Many thanks,
                    Clem
