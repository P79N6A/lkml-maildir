hm, i see this got changed recently - part of the networking stats went 
over to the lib/percpu_counter API recently.
The larger point still remains: the kernel dominantly uses static percpu 
variables by a margin of 10 to 1, so we cannot just brush away the static 
percpu variables and must concentrate on optimizing that side with 
priority. It's nice if the dynamic percpu-alloc side improves as well, of 
course.
