2.6.5-rc1-mm1 didn't come up for me. It loads, prints a few
early messages.  Then there is a video mode switch as it
brings up the radeon fb console. The pc reboots before the
flatscreen has time to sync, so I don't know exactly where it
goes wrong.  I might be able to try a CRT, they sync faster.
The 2.6.4-mm1 kernel works fine for me, with the same
config (including 4k stacks)
