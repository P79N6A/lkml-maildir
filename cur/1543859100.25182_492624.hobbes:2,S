How about this:
we get confused on what PG_dirty tells us, we fall back to pte_dirty,
transfer pte_dirty to PG_dirty and clear pte_dirty. Now it happens
again, however we don't have pte_dirty to fall back to anymore.
This would explain why disabling pte_mkclean() does make it go away and
non of the other tried approaches works.
We really need a way to sort out PG_dirty, independent of pte_dirty.
