Actually this isn't true. DBMS usually handle their own memory because
everything is done in blocks of the same size. Since this is configured
as part of the DBMS' parameters, it is much better at handling this
than the OS ever could be, once it has garnered the original memory
from the OS. Remember, this space is normally shared memory as well.
As for the FS, DBMS' prefer raw devices for consistency issues (as
well as speed). Raw devices prevent the use of the kernel's internal
buffers for files (thus reducing the number of memory copies involved).
