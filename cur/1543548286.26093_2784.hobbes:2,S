And for my severely depreciated $0.02 I am becoming concerned
that these guys are more concerned about some macho ideal of
generating programs while half crippled than about having things
work properly and maintainably no matter what gets in the way.
Art has flaws in it that have been painted over, often two or three
times. I grew up with a giant painting of Beethoven along side the
dinner table. It had been presented to my step-grandfather by
the Leipzig Symphony Orchestra. It captured the brooding artist
wonderfully. And in humid weather you could see his third hand,
the one the artist didn't like and painted over.
For all the zen meditation on code I begin to wonder how many of
the fixes really are fixes or painted over features that didn't quite
work out. It worries me no small bit.
<sigh> and here I thought macho didnt' fit well with people who
used their brains. I see it is as alive and well here as on the
streets of East LA.
