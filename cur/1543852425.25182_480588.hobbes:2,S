I have a vague recollection that we used to have depends in there, but
that didn't work out for other reasons (this is where my memory gets fuzzy).
I think it caused problems when you had forward referencing depends.
That may have been subsequently resolved in kconfig, so maybe its worth
trying again for .20
What's really strange is that this kconfig has been this way for a while,
and it's only really been causing problems the last few weeks. Hmm.
