You missed the beginning of the thread, I guess. The reason this thread
came to life was when Alan decided not to include some patches to knfsd &
raid in v2.2.11 (or was it 12?); thus it's pretty clear that we (at least
in the beginning of the thread) was talking of v2.2 kernels.

The problem is, that most people won't use an unstable kernel on
production systems, still they want new drivers to support their hardware.
And it's impossible to keep track of 3 kernel trees; just 2 trees is
almost one too much; some bugfixes takes quite some time to propagate from
one tree to the other.

Sunsolve... Ouch!

The only way to get stable kernels is that more persons test the unstable
kernels in my opinion. The trouble is that the circle of developers that
are most likely to test the kernels have a limited set of hardware, uses a
limited set of software, etc.
