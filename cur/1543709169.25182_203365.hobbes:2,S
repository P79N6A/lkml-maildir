Subject: include skbuff.h in userspace?

does anyone know whether it is at all possible to access sk_buff structures from
userspace? A simple
#include <linux/skbuff.h>
brings up way too many declaration conflicts between libc headerfiles and linux
headerfiles.
The reason I need this is that I've memory mapped complete sk_buffs into
userspace for a more efficient network monitoring platform (than bpf+libpcap). 
Thanks,
