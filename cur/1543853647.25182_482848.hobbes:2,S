Hi,
I have the following problem : based on the news that a working alsa
driver had just been published and pushed 2.6.19-way, I bought a new sound
card (expensive pro, if used one). Unfortunately using the out-of-tree
driver fails, so its author suggested to just try building one of the
2.6.19 rcs.
I used to do it a year ago or so when I had more free time. Since then my
hardware changed quite a lot (so did the core kernel) and it took me a few
evenings to re-assemble my build pipeline and configure a custom kernel.
Unfortunately the result does not boot. Since I haven't been using
anything but distro kernels for quite a long time I have no vanilla kernel
reference for this system.
It seems the failure occurs at md inspection time. The working distro
kernel startup messages look like this:
%<----
device-mapper: ioctl: 4.7.0-ioctl (2006-06-24) initialised:
dm-devel@redhat.com
md: Autodetecting RAID arrays.
md: autorun ...
md: considering sdb3 ...
md:  adding sdb3 ...
md: sdb1 has different UUID to sdb3
md:  adding sda3 ...
md: sda1 has different UUID to sdb3
md: created md1
md: bind<sda3>
md: bind<sdb3>
md: running: <sdb3><sda3>
raid1: raid set md1 active with 2 out of 2 mirrors
md: considering sdb1 ...
md:  adding sdb1 ...
md:  adding sda1 ...
md: created md0
md: bind<sda1>
md: bind<sdb1>
md: running: <sdb1><sda1>
raid1: raid set md0 active with 2 out of 2 mirrors
md: ... autorun DONE.
%<----
The failing kernels (I tried -rc5, -rc5-git6, -rc5-mm2 only print :
%<----
device-mapper: ioctl: 4.7.0-ioctl (2006-06-24) initialised:
dm-devel@redhat.com
md: Autodetecting RAID arrays.
md: autorun ...
md: ... autorun DONE.
%<-----
(I didn't bother copying the rest of the failing kernel dmesg, as sata
initialisation fills the first half of the screen, then dm is initialised,
then you only get the logical consequences of failing to detect the /
volume. The sata part seems fine – it prints the name of the hard drives
we want to use)
I'm attaching the dmesg for the working distro kernel (yes I know not 100%
distro kernel, but very close to one), distro config , and the config I
used in my test. If anyone could help me to figure what's wrong I'd be
grateful.
Regards,
