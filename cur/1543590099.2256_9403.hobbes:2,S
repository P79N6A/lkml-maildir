Right.  So we always need to keep heuristics in our toolbox to fallback on,
so we can run on boards with incomplete information.  However there is a lot
of things we can do that we aren't currently doing.
The example that sticks out in my head is we rely on the MP table to
tell us if the local apic is in pic_mode or in virtual wire mode.
When all we really have to do is ask it.
