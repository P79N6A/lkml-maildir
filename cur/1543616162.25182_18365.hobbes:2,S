The test has been repeated several times even with 2.2.21pre2 (although
we've run a lot more 2.2.20 tests). This was the first time we saw an oops.
The difference between this and the former 2.2.21pre2 runs is certain bios
settings. (We are still trying to isolate the one setting that triggers the
Via pci transfer corruption on HPT reads.) We'll repeat the test with these
settings and try to see if it is via bios settings / pci/quirks.c related.
There seems to be _something_ fishy in the pre2 quirks, since there is at
least one bios setting combination with which 2.2.20 does not show the pci
corruption, but 2.2.21pre2 does. It just that it is really tedious to
isolate. But we are working on it.
