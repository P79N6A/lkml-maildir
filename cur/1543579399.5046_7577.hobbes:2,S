Take a look at fghack (
http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/fghack.html
). It
opens a pipe, gives the write end to the daemon (but the daemon is not
aware of that) and monitors the read end. When the daemon process
exits, the read end of the pipe gets EOF.
If the daemon closes all filehandles, you're out of luck.
