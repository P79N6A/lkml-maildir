I like aging in principle, I just think the current aging algorithm is not
good enough. It isn't easy to design a better one, though ;-).
The per-process limits do nicely on single memory hogs, perhaps too nicely
(I remember running a synthesis job on a .5 GB memory Solaris machine, and
the synthesis process never got more than 200 MB RSS, the rest was swapped
out. Free memory: roughly another 200 MB. Ouch). But malicious attacks don't
care about per-process limits. They can just fork and produce new hogs.
