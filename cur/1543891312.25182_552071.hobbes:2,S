Your misreading the sentence above "You can have control over it" , this
means that you _can_ make lockstat use the TSC or disable itself when
the TSC is unstable.. Clock management is secondary to me, and we can
change it.. What matters more is if the "struct clocksource" provides a
better method for accessing lowlevel clocks than sched_clock() .. My
contention is that it does provide a better method.
