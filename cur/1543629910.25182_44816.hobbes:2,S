Hi all,
I've made a few small changes to the PCI Hotplug GUI tool (called
pcihpview) and released a new version of it.  I also built some .rpm
packages, to try to alleviate some of the problems people were having
when building from the tarball.
The files can be found at:
 	
http://www.kroah.com/linux/hotplug/pcihpview-0.3.tar.gz
 	
http://www.kroah.com/linux/hotplug/pcihpview-0.3-1.i386.rpm
 	
http://www.kroah.com/linux/hotplug/pcihpview-0.3-1.src.rpm
More info on the program (but not much), and the obligatory screenshot
can be found at:

The changelog entries for this version are:
	- added pcihpview.spec file so we can build rpms
	- added logging.c and logging.h to move logging messages to the
	  syslog
	- moved printk() calls to dbg().
	- added Refresh menu option.
Things that will be changing in the future are:
	- autorefresh for when slot status changes without user
	  interaction (needed when using the ACPI PCI Hotplug driver.)
	- user interface cleanups.
If anyone has any problems with the program, please let me know.
thanks,
greg k-h
