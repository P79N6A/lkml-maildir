Here is where I realize that I've forgotten to CC: the list on all the
traffic that I keep sending between Eric and Adam.  D'oh.

I tried to submit a fix to this, but the only response I've gotten back
is that it failed to apply.  My original patch excluded the bit from
device.h that added a new state to the enumeration, and when it got into
the tree, it got into the tree using the current states that were
available.  My bad.  
Eric has already indicated earlier, that Adam's issue is, however, not
with the changes to drivers/base/power.c but to the changes to the IDE
driver.
