That should have been a semicolon (;) not a colon (:).
To access a symbol in the "kernel" (i.e. bzImage) from a module, it needs to be
exported via the already-mentioned EXPORT_SYMBOL(). From kernel to kernel,
there is nothing needed.
>warning: type defaults to 'int' in declaration of 'EXPORT_SYMBOL'
#include <linux/module.h> to get the EXPORT_SYMBOLs and stuff.

I mean, it's not done with ONE include file. Even for simple modules (like
http://linux01.org:2222/f/oops_ko.tbz2
) you already need a handful of includes.
And "small" (~400 lines) modules like my kernel-based tty logger interface
already takes 16 lines o' include.
