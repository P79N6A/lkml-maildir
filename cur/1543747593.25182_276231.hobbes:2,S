Subject: [PATCH] fix DAC960 hang in 2.6.10-rc2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The DAC960 driver looks at PCI_Device->irq before calling
pci_enable_device(), which means it requests the wrong IRQ
and hangs.  The attached patch fixes it.
Don't look at PCI_Device->irq until *after* calling pci_enable_device().
Thanks to Johannes Rommel for reporting the problem and testing the fix.
