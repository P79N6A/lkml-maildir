Hi,
Does the KOBJ_NAME_LEN really means the limit of kobject name length? seems not . And if it's true, is the KOBJ_NAME_LEN of 20 enough to use?
In the kobject_set_name, the limit is 1024. Looks like either the comment or the code should be updated.
/**
 *      kobject_set_name - Set the name of an object
 *      @kobj:  object.
 *      @fmt:   format string used to build the name
 *
 *      If strlen(name) >= KOBJ_NAME_LEN, then use a dynamically allocated
 *      string that @kobj->k_name points to. Otherwise, use the static 
 *      @kobj->name array.
