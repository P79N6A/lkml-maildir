Unfortunately bug reports are sometimes lost in the noise. How many
times did you resend the bug report? Did you report all the required
information? Were you able to isolate the failing subsystem? Was there
a working kernel version? Did you try to isolate the changeset that
introduced the bug? Sometimes you have to complain many times and do a
bit of investigative work yourself. There are plenty of bug reports on
LKML which are being ignored because the original reported fails to
follow up on the problem.

IPW2200 hardware documentation is closed which narrows down the amount
of people who can help you out, sorry. Perhaps you could complain to
your vendor?
