I want it badly, but that's just me. :) The MS is about extending these
concept to apply to SMP resource allocation, which currently isn't something
that these kind of schedulers do. IMO, all of this kind of stuff is going to
be crucial for the next generation of operating systems.  Glue that scheduler
to a thread that's suppose to process network packets/io channels and you'll
have ubiquitous QoS throughout the system directly controllable by the scheduler.
That's my intuition on the subject. Time will tell.
