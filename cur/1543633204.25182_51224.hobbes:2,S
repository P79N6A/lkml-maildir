Have you guys checked out if the TCP_INFO getsockopt() would 
work for your needs? (obviously, it'll only work for TCP connections
). It gives you quite a bit of detail about what's happening 
in your TCP connection (retransmissions, window sizes etc.).
  printf("unacked: %d sacked: %d lost: %d retrans: %d fackets: %d\n",
                info.tcpi_unacked,info.tcpi_sacked,info.tcpi_lost,
                info.tcpi_retrans,info.tcpi_fackets);
  printf("pmtu: %d rcv_ssthresh: %d rtt: %d rttvar: %d snd_ssthresh:
%d\nsnd_cwnd: %d advmss:
%d reordering: %d\n",info.tcpi_pmtu,info.tcpi_rcv_ssthresh,
	 info.tcpi_rtt,info.tcpi_rttvar,info.tcpi_snd_ssthresh,info.tcpi_snd_cwnd,info.tcpi_advmss,
         info.tcpi_reordering);
