Ok, that is a reasonable constructive suggestion. The only disadvantage I
see is:
sysfs is mounted under /sys and having two distinct paths (a device node
/dev/cpu/microcode and a regular file somewhere in /sys) does not seem
worthwhile. Not necessarily illogical, just not worth the hassle, imho.
I think one filename is sufficient in this case. The fact that the same
filename may sometimes refer to a device node and other times (if devfs is
present) to a regular file may seem a little odd but it is not harmful and
since it is useful then why remove it or change it?
If you move it all the way to sysfs (i.e. no device node in /dev) then it
seems a bit odd that a device driver entry point is found somewhere other
than the usual /dev.
