I looked some more and really I think this is a bug in plip,
netif_rx() should only be invoked from software or hardware
interrupts.
If you look, the function invoking netif_rx() is called plip_bh() and
indeed I believe with that kind of funtion name it did run from
software interrupts (of BH's as they used to be called) at one point
but someone changed it over to execute from a workqueue for some
reason.
We really shouldn't punish all callers of netif_rx() just because
one call site doesn't invoke it in the correct context.
