That corresponds to enbd's default behavior.  Sigh. Guess I'll have to
make it 0-infty, instead of 0 or infty. It's easy enough - just need to
make it settable in proc (and think about which is the one line I need
to touch ...).

Making the driver "intelligent" is indeed bad news for the more
intelligent admin.  I was thinking of making it default to 0 timeout if
it knows it's running under raid, but I have a natural antipathy to
such in-driver decisions. My conscience would be slightly less on
alert if the userspace daemon did the decision-making. I suppose it
could.

Well, you can get in trouble if you allow even a single dirty page to
be outstanding to something, and have thousands of those somethings.
That's not the normal situation, however, whereas it is normal to
have a single network device and to be writing pell-mell to it
oblivious to the state of the device itself.
