Looking at the SGI implementation, it's smarter than you think.  Looks
like there's a register in the local I/O hub that lets you determine
when this write has been queued in the appropriate host->pci bridge.
So by the time __sn_mmiowb() returns, you're guaranteed no other CPU
can bypass the write because the write's got far enough.
