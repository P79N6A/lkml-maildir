This is intentional. Set3 was never meant to be translated. If you want
to use it, just pass i8042_direct=1 to the kernel (or the i8042 module).
Then you get untranslated Set3. If you're using a Set3 keyboard with a
mainboard that cannot handle Untranslation and Set3 correctly, well,
then choose a different keyboard or mainboard, they're not compatible.

Indeed this is wrong, but needed for many keyboards, which incorrectly
use the e0 prefix even in set3. However, this shoul pose no problem for
keyboards which use proper set3.

This can be fixed by restoring the i8042 chip configuration upon resume
(fix planned, I think Dmitry has one already).

I'm not very keen on going this way, see above.

Yes, there are and will be unsupported configurations. d) will be fixed
by setting i8042 to bootup values when suspending and to kernel values
when resuming. a) b) and c) will be fixed by turning off translation in
those cases and relying on it working because of d).
