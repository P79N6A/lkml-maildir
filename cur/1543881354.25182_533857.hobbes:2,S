And how about the individual FF ioctl? Did you mean registering another
chardev, which is totally ugly in my eyes or augment evdev.c to support
driver specific ioctl? i.e. either add another 'E' ioctl with pointer to
struct { code, value } as arg param or changing
if (_IOC_TYPE(cmd) != 'E'))
	return -EINVAL;
to sth. like
if (_IOC_TYPE(cmd) != 'E'))
	return dev->ioctl ? dev->ioctl(file, cmd, p) : -EINVAL;
in evdev_ioctl_handler, which is acceptable?
thanks,
