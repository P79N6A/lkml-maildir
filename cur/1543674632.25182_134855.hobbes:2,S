The reason I "eventually" "reproduced" it on 2.5 is because I
"eventually" ran an old, buggy version of my test case program that I
forgot to delete. :( 2.5 is actually not affected by this bug.
The 2.4 ioperm fix is truly, genuinely buggy, however. I'm going to send
a patch within the next few hours (if not the next few minutes).
