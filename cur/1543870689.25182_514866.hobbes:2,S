Paul Mundt has commented on setup_rt_frame() and provided a patch which
bullet-proofs that area.  I will include that patch into the next revision.
The value of ->sysenter_return is interpreted in user space by the
sysexit instruction; nobody else cares what the value is.  The kernel
is not required to provide a good value when vdso_enabled is zero,
because the kernel has not told the process that sysenter is valid
(by setting AT_SYSINFO.)  The kernel requires specific register values
for sysenter+sysexit and these values may change at the whim of the
kernel, so correct code must follow the kernel's protocol.
glibc uses sysenter only when AT_SYSINFO is present.  User code can
screw up even when vdso_enabled is non-zero, by overwriting or re-
mapping the vdso page (clobber memory at the destination of sysexit.)
Both context.vdso and sysenter_return could be set to zero whenever
vdso_enabled is zero; those two values might even be defaulted.
I'll add such a change to the next revision of the patch, if you'll
defend it against claims of "unnecessary code."

Correct.  Changing vdso_enabled from 0 to non-zero must be prepared
to lose this race if it is not prevented.  Ordinarily it won't matter
because the administrator will perform such changes at a "quiet" time.
