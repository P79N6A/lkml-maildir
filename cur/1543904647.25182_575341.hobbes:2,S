This sounds good in theory.
The practical problem with this approach is that there are always many 
people who use the old driver when the new driver doesn't work for them 
instead of reporting their problems with the new driver.
For these people a new driver will often suck when the old driver gets 
removed, but after the removal of the old driver they are finally forced 
to report their bugs resulting in a better new driver for everyone.
The sky2 driver is since nearly 2 years in the kernel and Stephen is 
usually quite good at handling bugs.
