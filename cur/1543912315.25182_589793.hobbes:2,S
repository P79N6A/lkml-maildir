Subject: regression of autofs for current git?

Hi,
I am wondering if this is a known issue, but I just built the current git
and several autofs mounts mysteriously disappeared. Restarting autofs could
fix some, but then lose others. 2.6.22 was fine.
Is there anything I could check other than bisect? (It may take some time
for me to get to it)
Thanks for your help.
Hua
