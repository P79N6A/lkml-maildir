Hi Jeff,
I'm submitting a set of bug fixes for inclusion in 2.6.21.
The patches are built against Linus'git tree.
Here is a brief description:
- Avoid deadlock when the interface is brought down
- Rework the MAC hang workaround since it was failing
  if the peer interface was brought down
- add missing RNIC register setting and CPL handler
Cheers,
Divy
