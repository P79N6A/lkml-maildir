you can work with latest release provided that you always have a fallback
to an earlier one. That way, you don't bet too much on something you don't
completely control. If it works, it tells you you'll be able to completely
exploit its new possibilities in next product release, and if it breaks,
it's easy to issue a fix to get back to earlier, well-tested version.
