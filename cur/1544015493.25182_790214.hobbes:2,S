in the 6680598..v2.6.29-rc1 window there's more than 3000 commits: there 
were libata and IDE changes, x86 changes, cpumask changes, ACPI changes 
and more. Any of those categories could produce such error symptoms as 
your box is showing.
Unless you can see some particular badness in the kernel messages 
(something that changed to the last working version) that narrows it down 
to some subsystem, i suspect this would have to be bisected ...
