Great idea.  I have similar functions in my lock-break patch...
This introduces "cond_resched_lock()" and "break_spin_lock()".  Both
take a lock has a parameter.  The former only drops the locks and
reschedules if need_resched is set.  It is optimized to only check once,
etc.  The later simply unlocks then relocks.
Patch is against your BK tree.
