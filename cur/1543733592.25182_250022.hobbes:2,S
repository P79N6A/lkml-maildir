Hello again!
SUMMARY:
I reported that i discover full cpu usage when performing disc i/o on an
sis5513 ide dma chipset. Disabling acpi and io-apic in the kernel and
passing pci=biosirq did not solve the problem. 
NEWS:
I think i found it!
I did not noticed that the /proc/stat fields changed between 2.4 and 2.6.
(my monitor util mystiriously couted/added "wating for io" to the sys cpu
time.)
That was what drived me crazy.
Yes, yes i did not check CHANGES file, sorry for the disturbing.
question: is "waiting for io" real cpu time, or can i consider this
time as idle? I was unable to figure this out by myself, sorry.
Best regards, 
Hendrik Fehr
PS: german for this is something like: "peinlich peinlich".
