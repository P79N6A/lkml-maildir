With linux 2.6.9 running at 192 MB/S network loading and protocol 
splitting drivers routing packets out of
a 2.6.9 device at full 100 mb/s (12.5 MB/S) simultaneously over 4 ports, 
the adaptec starfire driver goes into
constant Tx FIFO reconfiguration mode and after 3-4 days of constantly 
resetting the Tx FIFO window and
generating a deluge of messages such as:
ethX:  PCI bus congestion, resetting Tx FIFO window to X bytes
pouring into the system log file at a rate of a dozen per minute.  After 
several days, the PCI bus totally locks up
and hangs the system.  Need a config option to allow the starfire to 
disable this feature.  At very
high bus loading rates, the starfire card will completely lock the bus 
after 3-4 days
of constant Tx FIFO reconfiguration at very high data rates with 
protocol splitting and routing.
