You mean why is there one subsystem for all namespaces?
Convenience and no reason not to.  What advantage would there be for
the userspace tools if we have them split up?
There's no real reason other than memory waste not to split them
up - vserver users could always just mount all namespace subsystems
under one hierarchy.
But frankly I don't know where we stand right now wrt the containers
patches.  Do most people want to go with Vatsa's latest version moving
containers into nsproxy?  Has any other development been going on?
Paul, have you made any updates?
