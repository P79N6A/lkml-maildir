I can add an empty stub function, but that doesn't help to reduce the
ifdef mess as there is no /proc/<pid>/maps on nommu at all so we don't
have the struct file_operations and more important can't register it.
Maybe I need to make adding new entries for /proc/<pid>/ dynamic so
proc_mmu.c can just call
	create_proc_pid_entry("stats", &proc_maps_operations, ...)

Could be done.  Maybe Kai even has an even nicer generic version? :)
The new makefiles really need some docs..
