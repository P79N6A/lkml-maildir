It's a sign, a notice, and the reason I brought up this discussion is 
precisely because I don't think the kernel has any business being an 
enforcement mechanism - that's not what the spirit of our community is 
really about, we're about openness (as much as is possible).
If I go into an airport, open my laptop and connect to a network called 
"Free WiFi network", then I might have a good case to argue that I 
expected the WiFi to be free. If I connect to a network called "Not 
Free, Don't Use" then...I think the intent of the wording is clear.
Anyway. Are we doing this or not - the more I think about it, the more 
I'm kinda "happy" to just leave things as they are. Yes, bad people will 
continuing doing bad things no matter what we do. Do we really want to 
change stuff just to work around obvious abuse? Alan?
Jon.
