I have to feel that having a *working resume* capability is "any 
interesting features" enough. What you say about "simply never hear 
from" is unfortunately true.

The fact that Pavel thinks giving the users what they want is a problem 
certainly defines the difference between them, the populist "give them 
what they want" and the elitist "let's them make do with what I think 
they should have."
I do respect Pavel for all the stuff he has done and is doing, I wish I 
could have found a nicer way to say that.
