you recall correcty the mean :), it's 8 for data and 2 for instructions.
But I don't think the tlb is the problem, potentially it's a big win for
the big apps like database, more ram addressed via tlb and faster
pagetable lookups, it's the I/O granularity for the pageins that is
probably the most annoying part. Even if you've a fast disk, 2M instead
of kbytes is going to make difference, as well as the fact a 4M per page
and the bh on the pagecache would waste quite lots of ram with small
files.

I didn't read if P4 changes that, nor I checked the athlon yet, I read
it in the usual and a bit old system programmin manual 3.

that's the P6 family, so the PPro P2 P3 all included (only P5 excluded).
