Subject: 2.6 scheduler and "fast user switching"

Scenario:
I typically log in as 'root' on the first console. I then invoke 
fluxbox as the GUI.
# XSESSION=fluxbox startx -- :0
I then ctl-alt-F2 another console and login as 'user1'. I then 
invoke KDE as the GUI.
$ XSESSION=kde-3.1.4 startx -- :1
I may or may not ctl-alt-Fn and login as 'usern' and repeat the 
process.
Several thoughts:
1} I've seen Nick Piggin's suggestion of nicing X server to -10. 
At the moment, the only way I know to do this is something like
# XSESSION=fluxbox nice --adjustment=-10 startx -- :N
A} My default security is that only 'root' can perform nice with 
negative values. I am reluctant to play with security for such a 
crticial command.
B} All child threads inherit the new nice value. So in the example 
just above, this means all applications started from the GUI 
desktop run at a nice value of -10. I believe enhancing the X 
server nice value this way defeats the purpose of nicing it to 
begin with. Obviously, despite my readings and attempts at 
research, I'm must be missing something here.
2} I expect to travel down to Florida for Xmass to visit family. 
One of the things I had hoped to do was to set up my mother's 
computer as an X server and hang a thin client terminal {read: 
older PC} off of it. This would allowed my mother and brother to 
share a reasonably modern system at the same time.
This is not me just being cheap. I'm interested in setting up 
diskless workstations aound a good central X server. I see such 
setups as appropriate for a number of situations. If the X server 
requires 'nicing' in a single user environment, what happens in 
an LTSP environment?
My base reference environment is 2.4.20. I still actively use it 
for everything I do as everything works as expected. 
Despite my enthusiasm for 2.6, I find it difficult to get 
everything to 'just work'. I still see problems in the area of 
nForce based mobos {stupid proprietary nVidia!}, broken BIOSes, 
and scheduler issues like the above.
Flames, instruction, suggestions, thoughts would be appreciated.
FWIW, I'm not a C/C++ programmer. I'm computer literate and am not 
afraid to run bleeding edge.
