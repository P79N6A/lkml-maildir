sparsemem vmemmap is a sparsemem variant.  By that I mean that it uses all
the same infrastructure as sparsemem.  That sparsemem code is generic code
and shared with the other architectures.  There essentially is no code to
remove which is not generic and currently in use by other architectures.
The patches as they stand select the vmemmap variant unconditionally
when sparsemem is selected, we are not adding a new option for x86_64
overall -- in that sense classic sparsemem is already removed for x86_64
by these patches.
The longer plan is to pull out the other memory models where they are
no longer beneficial with a view to ending up with only one.  A good
example is the private virtual memory map implemented on ia64, which
is an early target.  As discussed at VM summit, we are also looking at
removing discontigmem for x86.  That review will continue.

I thought that a node was a unit of numa locality.  Cirtainly some
machines seem to express themselves as memory only nodes and cpu only
nodes; in the past I am sure we have also heard of IO only nodes
representing "io drawers" and the like.
