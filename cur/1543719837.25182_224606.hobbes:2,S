Yeah, I know about the problems to generate a complete call graph.
With function pointers, it is plain impossible to get it right in the
most general case.
Note the "in the most general case" part.  You can get things right if
you make some assumptions and those assumptions are actually valid.
In my case the assumptions are:
1. all relevant function pointers are stuffed into some struct and
2. no casts are used to disguise function pointer as something else.
If you stick with those rules, the resulting code is quite sane, which
is much more important than any tools being usable.  If the kernel
doesn't stick to those rules for a good reason, I'd like to know about
it, so I can adjust my tool.  And if the kernel doesn't stick to those
rules for no good reason, the code if broken and needs to be fixed.
Is this sane?
