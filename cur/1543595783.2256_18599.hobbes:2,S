As Alan said, driver versions are incredibly useful.  People use update
their drivers over top of kernel drivers all the time.  Vendors do it
too.  "Run dmesg and e-mail me the output" is 1000 times more simple for
end users.

Note that KERN_DEBUG appears in dmesg by default in 2.4, AFAICS.  This
may be a big source of complaints, right there...
