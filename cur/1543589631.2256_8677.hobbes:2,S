The README on the webpage has been updated finally.
Compile usb-storage with Freecom support, load it and osst. 
Access the device via /dev/(n)osst0. Use a blocksize of 32k.
(pipe over buffer -s 32k or use tar -b 64, see README.)
Newer versions of osst overcome this block size limitation, but those 
have not yet been merged to the mainstream kernel.
If you find trouble, please also report to osst@linux1.onstream.nl.
Enjoy!
