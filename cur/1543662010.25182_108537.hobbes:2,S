Greetings. 
I have had reported from a client that they are having problems with
backups that span more than one tape. Instead of getting an EOT error
or EOM, they are getting an I/O error wich requires the driver to be
unloaded and reloaded before the tape will work again. 
http://www.linuxtapecert.org/
 Says that the redhat 2.4.9-34 kernel is
the last one that had proper EOT handling. Indeed, if they use the
2.4.9-34 kernel, the tape works properly. Thats not a very good
solution however. 
Is this fixed in the latest 2.4.21-pres? How about in 2.5.x?
Has anyone else seen this?
I can get further details to track this down and fix it if it's not
already fixed.
