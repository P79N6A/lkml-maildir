And the other VAIO's don't.  The small picturebook VAIO, for example,
comes with firewire, USB, video, audio, modem and IR.  And nothing else. 
The only way to connect a floppy to it is through the USB (the thing
comes with a USB floppy) or with a PCMCIA card. 
Even then the video is a "compressed formfactor" thing that requires a
special cable.  Which in fact is a much better solution than the one I
have seen on larger laptops, where they often use a regular VGA
connector but then have so little space around it that many VGA cables
still do not work without whittling the plastic down from around the
connector.

I also really like the VAIO.  It's good engineering from all I can tell,
but the engineers also obviously decided that they'd be able to go the
extra mile in being compact only by depending on modern devices. A
choice I like, as I'm getting tired of all the legacy stuff around.
But easy to install? Nope.
