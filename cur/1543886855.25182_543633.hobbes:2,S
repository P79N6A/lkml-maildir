It's amazing, you appear to have taken the worst feature of bug/feature 
management systems - mandatory registration - and applied it to patch 
submission too.
Is that rejection message standard? The first part makes no sense - why 
would you hold non-subscriber emails in a submission queue and then just 
reject them because they're not subscribers?
