[4294696.252000] i2c_adapter i2c-1: SMBus Quick command not supported, 
can't probe for chips
[4294696.252000] i2c_adapter i2c-2: SMBus Quick command not supported, 
can't probe for chips
[4294696.252000] i2c_adapter i2c-3: SMBus Quick command not supported, 
can't probe for chips
My sensors continue to work fine, but up to 2.6.15, I had no issues, I 
manually compile the I2C options in that are relative to my hardware.  Are 
these errors now `normal' in 2.6.16.x?
Thanks,
Justin.
