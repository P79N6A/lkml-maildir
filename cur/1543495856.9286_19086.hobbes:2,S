I don't understand that, either.

After some investigation, this is my current impression of the  
Linux kernel:
o If you are inside the kernel, you either have exactly one user  
level program context or none (e.g. in a bottom half of an IRQ  
handler)
o A user level context means that the complete programs address  
space is accessible from the kernel (the MMU setup "fits" to that  
user process)
o There is no way that all memory regions of two processes are  
mapped at the same time.
=> to my knowledge, there is no way that the kernel can directly  
copy data from process A to process B, when the data origin is  
unrestricted
Some RTOS (real time operating systems) use a trick: they map the  
memory space of each user process somewhere in the kernel space.  
This is fine as long as the sum of concurrently running programs  
multiplied with the programs used memory (physical+swap) usage is  
much lower than the virtual address space (e.g. 4 GB).
For a RTOS with no swap and a typical total physical memsize of  
<<128MB, this will work just fine.
To my knowledge, there are two possible solutions to avoid memory  
copying:
1) user level programs use shared memory, so they don't need the  
kernel at all
2) handing over of memory (see the Doors stuff,  
http://www.rampant.org/doors/
).
I looked at both, and they have some major drawbacks (depending on  
what you want to do):
1) as of today, Linux doesn't support mutexes between processes  
(glibc mutexes work only within a process). This is mainly because  
process shared mutexes would require kernel support, and the kernel  
doesn't support that  
(
http://pauillac.inria.fr/~xleroy/linuxthreads/faq.html
).
2) the Doors implementation needs a patched kernel
