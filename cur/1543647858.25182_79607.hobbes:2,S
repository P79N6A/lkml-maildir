    Hi all, specially Marcelo :)
    This is the fourth and last time I submit this patch to Marcelo.
This little tiny bug is fixed in all trees except the official one. I
think this patch is trivial enough to be accepted, but...
    Well, the attachments included (unified diff format), is the patch
against both 2.4.19 and 2.4.20-pre10 (I've changed the kernel name
directory part to '/usr/src/linux/' so it's applicable to both
versions.
    Marcelo, if you don't want to include this patch at least let me
know, please, so I won't need to see each new prerelease for seeing
if the patch has been already included ;))) Don't take it bad.
    Raúl
