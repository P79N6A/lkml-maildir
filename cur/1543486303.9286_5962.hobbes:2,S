	If you have a way to deal with that... BTW, I strongly suspect
that any solution involving scanning potential ancestors is *not* good -
you can construct very unpleasant DoS that way.

	Could you elaborate? I am trying to figure out the way to do that
and for the case of multiple links *from the same directory* I have a
kinda-sorta solution. For generic thing... I would really like to hear

	nullfs. It was invented for such things and we can do it. With
*very* small overhead - dcache helps big way here.
