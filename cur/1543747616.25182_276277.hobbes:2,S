I just run the same test on 2.4.27 and the behaviour is completely
different.
The box seems to be stuck in a swap in/out loop for quite a long time.
During this time the box is not responsive at all. It finally stops the
forking after quite a long time of swapping with
fork() (error: resource temporarily not available). 
There is no output in dmesg, but I'm not able to remove the remaining
hackbench processes as even a kill -SIGKILL returns with 
fork() (error: resource temporarily not available)
I'm not sure, which of the two scenarios I like better :)
FYI, I tried with 2.6 UP and PREEMPT=n. The result is more horrible. The
box just gets stuck in an endless swap in/swap out and does not respond
to anything else than SysRq-T and the reset button.
With the callback the machine did not come back after 20 Minutes.
Without the callback the machine dies after about 10 Minutes and killing
all available processes except init with:
Kernel panic - not syncing: Out of memory and no killable processes...

Yeah, there are enough tasks and with preempt enabled more than one
tasks requests memory. That explains the repetitive calls to
out_of_memory(). This only happens on UP + PREEMPT=y and SMP. See above.

You meant the one in badness() right ?
Well it makes it better, but I was able to have a second invocation
before the first killed tasks exited. That's simple to explain. The task
is on the way out and releases resources, so the VM size is reduced and
the killer picks another process.

I think the callback is the only safe way to fix that. If PF_MEMDIE is
racy then I'm sure we will find a different indicator for that.

Yep, but the reentrancy blocking with the callback makes the time, count
crap and the watermark check go away, as it is safe to reenable the
killer at this point because we definitely freed memory resources. So
the watermark comes for free.
