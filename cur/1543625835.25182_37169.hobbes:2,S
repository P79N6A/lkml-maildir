Note that this is exactly what I think.
Each option is defined with a unique value used for all devices.
/usr/src/linux/drivers/usb$ grep MODULE_PARM ../net/3c59x.c                     
MODULE_PARM(debug, "i");
...
MODULE_PARM(enable_wol, "1-" __MODULE_STRING(8) "i");
MODULE_PARM(rx_copybreak, "i");
...
In a sense the vortex is more flexible. Most options are defined by a
single value but for a few you can pass a vector. 
NOTE that the 8 limit is only in the MODULE_PARM lines.
But this flexibility is no more adapted. 
$ man nameif
...
DESCRIPTION
       nameif  renames network interfaces based on mac addresses.
       When no arguments are given /etc/mactab is read. Each line
nameif solved a problem but not during the device activation (this is
the difference between rename and name). Would not it be possible to add
to hotplug a way to give back some advices to the kernel.
kernel -> hotplug : I am going to insert this device.
hotplug -> kernel : ok but use this options optionA,optionB,...
You can then still use nameif during the register phase or eventually
pass a directive earlier to avoid possible races.
