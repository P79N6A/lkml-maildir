Hi,
My disc throughput on a Intel PIIX4 with an IBM-DTTA-351010 (10 GB/hda) and a Western Digital WD800BB-00BSA0 (80 GB/hdb)
Kernel is 2.5.1-dj2
Maybe it helps a bit ;)
Little question for the masters of hardware here in the list... buffer-chache reads speed is just the speed of the cache, right?
So I think only buffered disk reads say something about the real speed of the drive. And 10 or 11 MB/sec aren't much...
