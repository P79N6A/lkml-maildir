Compiler barrier != CPU barrier.
The memory clobber is a compiler barrier that prevents its global optimizer
from moving memory references. The CPU memory ordering guarantees are completely 
independent from this.

The problem is the relationship to other operations.
This is not theoretic and we have had bugs because of this.
