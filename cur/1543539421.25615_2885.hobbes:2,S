I'm having a similar problem with 2.4-test series (and with 2.3.9x kernels
too, I haven't tried earlier ones though).  The problem seems to be with
memory detection, as if I pass mem=48M to the kernel all works fine.
Of course I just figured it was this box, and it acts odd in a lot of
situations(my guess is that the bios doesn't like the cyrix cpu for some
reason....)
