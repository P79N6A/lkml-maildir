Hi I did that already; sorry for not being clearer about it in the bug
report. For some of my systems I had patched my kernel to have the
latest source code from your site for our aic79xx machines. I ran that
kernel on these other systems and it locked up in a similar state.
 I am ready for the additional debugging options :). Thanks for your
quick response.
