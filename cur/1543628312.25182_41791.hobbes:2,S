That reminds me.
Can you get the bkbits.net interface to spit out text/plain GNU-style
patches?
IIRC the web interface currently spits out HTML-ized per-cset patches,
so I am hoping it would be trivial to get you guys to change that to
text/plain, or offer text/plain in addition to HTML.
That would IMO eliminate an objection or two about the opaqueness of BK,
and also eliminate the need for any bkbits.net user to generate per-cset
patches.  They would need only to give a URL to a CGI which spits out
text/plain GNU-style patches.
