How could losing 40% of your CPU's to spin locks NOT spank your throughtput?  
Can you copy your lockmeter data from its kernel_flag section?  Id like to 
see it.

No.  We're attempting to see if we can scale to large numbers of spindles 
with EXT3 at the moment.  Perhaps we can effect positive changes to ext3 
before giving up on it and moving to another Journaled FS.
