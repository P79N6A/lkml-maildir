you cannot generally invoke BIOS services when the operating system is
running, except for well-defined interfaces like APM or PCI BIOS. To talk
to the disk you use the services provided by Linux device driver and not
some stinking BIOS (which is only needed for booting anyway).
To summarize - Linux is the operating system, it is not a toy like the
ones made by Microsoft.
