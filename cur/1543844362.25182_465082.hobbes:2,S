To restate, readl() should read a little endian value, and return a 
CPU-endian value.  writel() should receive a CPU-endian value, and write 
a little endian value.
If your platform's readl/writel doesn't do that, it's broken.
That's why normal PCI drivers can use readl() and writel() on either 
big-endian or little-endian machines, without needing to use le32_to_cpu().
