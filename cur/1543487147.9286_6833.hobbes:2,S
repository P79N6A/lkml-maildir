Hm.   The way I understand it, CONFIG_PACKET enables the SOCK_PACKET
API and CONFIG_FILTER enables the packet filter API.   That worked in
Linux 2.2.1.   Has this changed in 2.2.2?
WRT Phillippe and Eloy's exchange, the DHCP *server* does not require
the filter - it's the client that does.  And since the distribution is
build from a common source pool, I had to pick one, so I wound up
picking the filter.  :'(
