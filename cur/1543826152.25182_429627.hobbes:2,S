I don't care where the mode setting code comes from. I don't care if
it runs in the kernel or in user space. This argument has been going
on for two years without resolution so I've started working on Mozilla
instead of graphics while I wait for it to resolve.
For a while I didn't understand why 10K of code per adapter had to be
such a controversial subject. Now I understand that this code is a
lighting rod for the causes of microkernel vs monolithic and platform
independence vs Linux specific.
I've posted my requirement for a design. I'll be happy with anything
that satisfies those requirements and works.
