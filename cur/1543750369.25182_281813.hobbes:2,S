If the single-stepping changes truly broke your program, and you know
< 2.6.9-rc1 works, try this attached diff against 2.6.10 in addition
to the other one I made.  This should effectively reverse change #2,
but like I said, the current code for change #2 actually works for me
now.  But maybe this is not enough.  You can also look here at my
original report:
http://www.winehq.org/hypermail/wine-devel/2004/11/0310.html
and reverse the original patches against 2.6.9, and see if that kernel
works then. Patch links:
