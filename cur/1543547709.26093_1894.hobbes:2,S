   Right now as I see it (pretending everything is black and white);
   you, Dave, Linus and a few other people[1] are more than happy with
   debugging aids as they exist right now in a stock kernel.
   However, there are many many other people far less talented than
   yourselves and for use less capable people having a compile time
   options of IKD or something might really be of use....
I think what it comes down to is that the folks who know the tree the
best and do the most work/fixing in it, think the debugging stuff
should remain a seperate patch.
We believe that it doesn't belong in the main source tree mainly
for two reasons:
1) It is clutter.  I don't want to see the debugging/debugger code
   when most of the time it serves no purpose.
   NOTE: This is different than "BUG()" and "ASSERT()" which serve
         a different purpose becuase they not only act as a
         consistency check, but they also _document_ how the author
	 of the code believed the world around it must behave :-)
2) It is hoped that because it isn't the default, some new people
   will take the quantum leap to actually try debugging using the
   best debugger any of us have, our brains, instead of relying on
   automated tools.
Later,
David S. Miller
