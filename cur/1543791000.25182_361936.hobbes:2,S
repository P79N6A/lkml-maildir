Thanks, I didn't realized I'd deviated from the recommended style.  In
this updated version of the patch, I've removed the ifdefs that could
sanity-check arguments to the exported entry points and adjusted the
comments to follow the guidelines.

I hope you mean -p1 vs -p0.  I tend to prefer -p0 myself, but quilt
makes it easy enough to handle either :-)  Fixed in the revised
version.

In this case, it would, because I'm adding static and two leading
underscores.  But I'll keep that in mind, since this is quite
different from the GCC style.

I hope it is as useful after the statement.  Moving it before it would
move it too far apart from what it refers to IMHO.
Thanks again for the style feedback, it's really appreciated.
Should I have retained the problem description in the patch file, or
is the Signed-off-by: line enough?
