Well, in fact my hope was, somebody from lkml would give it a quick   
look, because it again turned out the original author may not see     
minor problems :-)

Yes, I declare myself guilty. It's a nice example how a real simlpe   
patch woes.

Lots. :-)                                                             
Last event which made me think about this patch to submit (and not    
just hacking in every time I needed it), were 12. But to be honest, I 
made it work for less than 8 because I do think that 8 is a bit       
oversized for most people.

I love to in the future, now that I _know_ it. :-) Please convert it  
on your next submission to Marcelo & L. We don't wanna keep           
superfluous code.

Hm, good question. The thing is: I wanted to make 1000% sure it       
doesn't get lost. This should have been already in the first patch,   
where it was not really clear how to get the CONFIG definition.       
Additionally I feel uncomfortable with code being not complete in     
terms of symbols. You cannot grep through *.c/*.h to find             
missing/mis-spelled symbols then. I always lived with the idea that   
compile-time definitions _tune_ the code, but it should be complete   
even without. In fact it doesn't make a difference in the created     
binary.

Feel free. I in fact thought about the other way round, but that's    
only a personal viewing and reading issue.

You're welcome.                                                       
                                                                      
While reading config.c I came to the conclusion that this is pretty   
"organic" code :-) .                                                  
As in most ISDN drivers I read so far there is a whole lot of         
duplication inside. I had the strong urge to clean it up, but didn't  
want to submit a whole new file as a patch dealing with something     
completely different.                                                 
Perhaps I will in the future.                                         
                                                                      
Regards,
