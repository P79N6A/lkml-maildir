Nope, software interrupts sound more like the interface 
user -> kernel, but System.map additionaly containing
Kernel only symbols, who are not accessible directly with syscals 
(but may be used by them).

cat /proc/ksyms | grep -v "^c8" | sort 
gives a subset off System.map (the Symbols exported for module use).
