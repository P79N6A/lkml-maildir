Submitting an actual applyable patch is preferred. Makes it possible
to easily apply your changes to test the changes and then the file and
function is also part of the patch so you won't have to spell that out
explicitly.
Use   diff -up

No space for the beginning parenthesis and space before the opening
bracket is preferred:
       if ((n == 0) && (inp == NULL) && (outp == NULL) &&
               (exp==  NULL)) {

Having a printk() here certainly won't help performance.

Wouldn't it make sense to jump out at this point if there's a signal pending?
                if (signal_pending(current)) {
                        ret = -ERESTARTNOHAND;
                        goto out;
                }
Or am I missing something?

Small style thing:   usec *= (1000000 / HZ);
