Which is exactly what the next release of mdadm does.
As the patch comment said:
: With this approach the pagecache may contain data which is inconsistent with 
: what is on disk.  To alleviate the problems this can cause, md invalidates
: the pagecache when releasing the file.  If the file is to be examined
: while the array is active (a non-critical but occasionally useful function),
: O_DIRECT io must be used.  And new version of mdadm will have support for this.
