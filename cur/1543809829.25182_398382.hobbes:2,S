OK, I'll just add touch_softlockup_watchdog() if needed but first lets
wait for results of your patch.
Note that I'll invest my time on this which could be invested into other
things and I don't see it as top-priority issue if you differ in your opinion
you should be the person fixing affected drivers.
The conclusion of the rant is:  people making changes at higher layers
should start paying maintenance costs of their changes.  Over few years
of maintaining IDE I learned quite a lot about block layer, VFS, VM, ACPI,
PM, IRQ routing, scheduling, sysfs etc (I'm not talking about interface
changes but about bugs/changes which are reported by end users
and driver maintainers are end-point).  This is all good but distracts me
from my primary task and now it is turn for people hacking on generic
code to learn few driver specific things... :)
No wonder that nobody wants to hack drivers: less fame, more flames,
and actually besides knowing hardware you need to know a lot about
kernel in general to do your job right.  I hope that Andrew is reading this.
End of whining.

It is "y" by default so anybody saying "y" to DEBUG_KERNEL will get it as
added bonus and moreover DEBUG_KERNEL is "y" in x86_64 defconfig.
