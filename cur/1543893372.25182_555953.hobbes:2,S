Hi,
Here's the result of the search for the second patch that breaks resuming
from RAM on HPC nx6325 (x86_64):
ide-ide-hpa-detect-from-resume.patch
The symptom is that after the resume there's no backlight and the screen
apparently doesn't work, 100% of the time, although apart from this the system
seems to be functional.
The box doesn't even have an IDE HDD, but the DVD is handled by the atiixp
driver.
Greetings,
Rafael
