The kernel support this type of memory architecture if you enable
CONFIG_DISCONTIGMEM.  One machine which uses this feature is the Origin,
grep in arch/mips64 for CONFIG_DISCONTIGMEM.  There are also several
ARM system using it.
As support for CONFIG_DISCONTIGMEM is less than perfect you should check
if your system allows for reconfiguration of memory as a single physically
contiguous chunk.
Don't use add_memory_region() in this case; that code only works well
for small holes in memory address space.  Your holes are fairly large
so memory management would waste about 2mb if you would not use
CONFIG_DISCONTIGMEM.
