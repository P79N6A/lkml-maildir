If you care, i'd be happy doin' some testing. I own a rather old
(aren't they all?:) TechniSat[tm] PCI "Techni-PC-Sat".
On board:
ZR36120PQC, SAA5246AGP/E, UM6264DM-70LL, ITT VPX3220A-PR-CA, and some
ALPS..
.. not sure if this one will be supported. I've looked into
Documentation 3 years ago, but never had time nor a fast enough machine
to try some recording - so i never had it properly running. yet.
