I ran across something today that might help with this problem.  The web
site www.storagereview.com (?) could only test the ATA-66 drives with an
ATA-66 controller and expect the drive to work under any OS.  So now all
manufacturers but one (Fujitsu, I think), supply a DOS utility for those
without an ATA-66 controller to disable ATA-66 and just allow ATA-33. If
you don't use this utility, I think the drives run in some very slow DOS
mode (when lacking an ATA-66 controller).  If you go there, you can find
a page with links to all manufacturers' download links for this software
fix.
