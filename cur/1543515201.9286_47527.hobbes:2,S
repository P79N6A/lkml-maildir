On a multihomed Squid proxy server running RedHat 6.1 and linux 2.2.13 I get
this odd behaviour: ifconfig can't find any devices on the FIRST run. 
	# ifconfig
	: error fetching interface information: Device not found
Running ifconfig again works fine. It takes quite a while, several hours,
before ifconfig returns the same error again.
(This also happened with RedHat 6.0, which perhaps speaks against it being a
ifconfig problem.)
