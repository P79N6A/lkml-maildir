for POSIX 4 (today better: IEEE 1003.1b Real time & I/O) you should read
this document:
ftp://ftp.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/local/cip/mskuhn/misc/linux-posix.1b
because this document is not very new, there are a few changes in the linux
kernel and the glibc 2.1.
New are for example the "_POSIX_REALTIME_SIGNALS". But for the newest
possiblities you should look into the sources of the glibc or the kernel
header files! (unistd.h etc.)
Very interesting is the fact that a few features cannot be implementet.
e.g.
the POSIX function pthread_attr_setscope(), because of the "one-to-one"
model of linux threads.
