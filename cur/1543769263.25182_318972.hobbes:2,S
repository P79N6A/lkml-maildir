Thanks, this patch worked. When in 6ch mode, the boolen flag we talk about
still controls if the line jack is input or output. In 4ch mode, it is always
input. If i chech it, switching to 6ch does not toggle it. They are
independent controls.
Anyways. I can't get rid of the flag. It is initialized to on by default.
Isn't strange to have two ways of controlling this ?
Now we have:
Surround jack mode: [Shared/Independent]
Channel mode [2/4/6]
Center/LFE jack as mic [on/off]
Spread Front... [on/off]
Would not be nice something like:
Surround jacks mode: [Shared/Independent]
Line Jack: [in/surround-out/extra-front-out]
Mic Jack: [in/center-out/extra-front-out]
It looks like internally you can control all ouputs independently.
Just an idea that looks more logical/intuitive to me...
Ah, and could the input level controllers for line and mic be forced
to mute when used as inputs ?
