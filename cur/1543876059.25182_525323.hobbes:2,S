Shouldn't getting/putting the module refcount be solely done in
kobject.c? Grab the module reference when the kobject is created and
release the module reference in kobject_cleanup() after the release
function has been called. This doesn't make kobject_get() heavier, and
it ensures we don't delete the module until after the last kobject it is
supposed to clean up has been released.
