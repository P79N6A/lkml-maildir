Debian Slink (2.1), binutils is at 2.9.1.0.19a-2 in their money, but
bfd.h is not anywhere on my system according to find & locate.
Probably simplest to mail myself a copy from a RH machine at work
tomorrow.

Ok, so my cover's blown, I'm not a kernel hacker [g].  Here's my latest
offer . . .
[<c01abce3>] c01abbe8 t ppa_completion
[<co1b0378>] c01b0248 t aic7xxx_reset_current_bus
[<c01ac2c5>] c01abf58 t ppa_engine
[<c010aa65>] c010aa10 T handle_IRQ_event
[<c01abeab>] c01abe80 t ppa_interrupt
[<c0112852>] c01127f8 T tqueue_bh
[<c0119b65>] c0119ae0 T do_bottom_half
[<c0106000>] c0106000 T get_options
[<c010abbd>] c010ab70 T do_IRQ
[<c0108c9c>] c0108c9c T ret_from_intr
[<c0106000>] c0106000 T get_options
[<c0107347>] c010730c T cpu_idle
[<c01075b7>] c0107594 T kernel_thread
Well, I couldn't find any direct connection between ppa_completion (in
ppa.c) and aic7xxx_reset_current_bus, so I guess I'll have to wait for
further instructions.
Oh, and I think I've just remembered the text of another error message
(benign AFAIK) which I see occasionally during Zip access, although I
really cannot pin it down to this particular problem:
end SCSI request: buffer list destroyed
or something similar.  That might be a red herring, though.
Thanks again for assistance, the irony of backup lockups is getting
_less_ funny with the passage of time, strangely enough.
Regards,
