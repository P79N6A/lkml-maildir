   the BLKGETSIZE ioctl returns sector size of block devices (ie,
   /dev/sda1). but don't sector sizes vary as well? there doesn't seem to
   be an ioctl to get sector size, unfortunately.
No, the sector size is always 512; or at least, it should always be 512,
for the purposes of the kernel/user-mode interface.
