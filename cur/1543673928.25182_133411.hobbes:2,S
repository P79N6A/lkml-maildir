   i suspect atm doesnt use rtnl because its register/unregister
   function dont use the underlying netdevice layer (when perhaps it
   should).
There is no correlation between whether you use netdevice or not
and whether network configuration changes should be synchronized
using the RTNL semaphore :-)
   thanks for the pointer.
No problem.
   here is the the atm_dev locking patch with the __module_get change:
Ok, I'll apply this.  But long term we really need to clean out
the cobwebs here, use RTNL, do solid module refcounting etc.
