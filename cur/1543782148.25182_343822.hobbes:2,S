Configuring "preempt" gives lower latency, because then
almost anything can be interrupted (preempted).  You can then
get very quick responses to some things, i.e. interrupts and such.
The cost comes, because _something_ was interrupted, something
that instead would run to completion first in a kernel made without 
"preempt".
So that other thing, whatever it is, got slower. 
And the problem is bigger than merely "things happens in a different order".
Switching the cpu from one job to another have a big overhead.  
Particularly,
the cpu caches have to be refilled more often, which takes time.  
Running one
big job to completion fills the cache with that job's data _once_.  If 
the job
is preempted a couple of times you have to bring it into cache three
times instead, and that will cost you, performance wise.
This is not _necessarily_ your problem, but trying a 2.6 kernel without 
preempt
and with hz=100 (both things configurable through normal kernel 
configuration)
will clearly show if this is the problem in your case.  If you're lucky, 
this is all
you need to get your performance back.  If not, then at least it is an
important datapoint for those trying to figure it out.  Nobody here want
2.6 to have 1/4 of the performance of 2.4!
