That's odd.  getcwd returning an empty string.
I can only see that happening if you do the equivalent of
   chdir("/");
   chroot("/somewhere");
   getcwd(buf,sizeof(buf));
That would return an empty string with the new code but not with the
old.
But I cannot imagine gnome-vfs-daemon doing a chroot, as it does not
run as root.
You could try removing the
		if (*buffer == '/') {
			buffer++;
			buflen++;
		}
from the new __d_path.  But that still wouldn't really explain what
was happening.
Maybe also put a WARN_ON(! *buffer) just before the return to find out
exactly what is going on when the empty string is returned.
