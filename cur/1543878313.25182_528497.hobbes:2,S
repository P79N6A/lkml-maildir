I see the same thing with my nightly scripts that do syslog analysis, last year 
I trimmed 2 hours from the nightly run by processing compressed files instead of 
uncompressed ones (after I did this I configured it to compress the files as 
they are rolled, but rolling every 5 min the compression takes <20 seconds, so 
the compression is < 30 min)
now I just need to find a version of split that can compress it's output files.
