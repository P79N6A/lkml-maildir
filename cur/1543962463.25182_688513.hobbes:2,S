It happens a bit before that because when it hangs it doesn't 
print the above lines, and when it does not hang these lines are
the ones right after the point where it hangs.

Yes you are right. When I have luck and the boot succeeds my Sony laptop
is rock solid and the kernel is wonderful (even the card reader works!).

A few days ago I found this message in lkml in reply to a hpet patch
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/7/361
 in which the reporter also had 
a similar hang, which was cured by hpet=disable. 
So it is in my TODO list to try to check out if that patch is 
in the current -git and whether it can be reverted somehow (I 
added Venki to the Cc: now)
Thanks a lot for the answer!
