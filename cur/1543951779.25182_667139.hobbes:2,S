Can you please revert this change before 2.6.25 is released?
'make headers_install_all' has to be reliable.

    KVM: Export include/linux/kvm.h only if $ARCH actually supports KVM
    Currently, make headers_check barfs due to <asm/kvm.h>, which <linux/kvm.h>
    includes, not existing.  Rather than add a zillion <asm/kvm.h>s, export kvm.h
    only if the arch actually supports it.
