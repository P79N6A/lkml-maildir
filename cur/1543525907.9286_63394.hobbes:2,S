First of all, thanks to everybody who helped me in detecting correctly my hard
drive. Even though I use and work with Linux for two years, I'm still amazed by
how helpful is the people in this list. Thanks again.
OK, now my hard drive is working ( in its full 17.2 GB mode ), and of course, I
was the guilty. Andries gave me a hint in his last e-mail, to check the jumpers.
It turned out that in the manual Western Digital gives two different settings,
depending on how many pins ( 9 or 10 ) has the hard drive. 
Well, it seem sthat I used the setting for 9 pins, when the hard drive has 10 (
my only excuse is that it was 4 AM when I installed it ). Strangely, it was
being detected as an 8 GB with this configuration. I should go back to
elementary to learn how to count.
This is one of this days in which I feel very stupid and happy at the same time
:-)
Thanks to all,
Hugo
BTW: just for completeness, it works fine under 2.2.12-20 ( Red Hat version )
without having to specify linear mode nor stting up a dummy cyl/heads/sectors
configuration uin lilo.conf
