That is precisely the point I was making in my previous email. But both
that email and yours asnwer only one question:
a) should access(2) behave identical to open(2) (with switched uid)? The
answer is Yes.
but the main question still remains unanswered:
b) what should be the return of access(W_OK) (or, the same, open() for 
write with switched uid) for devices on a readonly-mounted filesystems?
Should the majority win? I.e. should we say OK, as we do now?
