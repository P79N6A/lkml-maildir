I agree.  This is a fantastic kernel - so good infact, it'll probably be
awhile before I try out a new one unless some other issue(s) comes up. 
I had a nagging problem with XF864 dying with Sig'11 on SMP and this has
completely cleared it up.  
There's probably several issues with this kernel, but as the saying goes
'It works for me.'.  Excellent work.
