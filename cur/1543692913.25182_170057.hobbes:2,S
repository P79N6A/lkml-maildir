None.  It only matters for block device inodes.  Out-of-tree fs is free to
do whatever it does with inodes of regular files/directories/etc.  
In quite a few cases you can cut down on dereferencing that way, but that's
covered by what you've mentioned.
If you take a look at the patchset you'll see
	* change of method prototypes in block devices (aka "you don't need
to start with bdev = inode->i_bdev, you get it from arguments" - check RD1--RD6
and you'll see)
	* a lot of places in mm/* that got aforementioned search-and-replace
treatment
	* very few changes in fs code, most of them of the same variety (same
search-and-replace)
	* couple of helper functions changed their prototypes:
		generic_write_checks() lost "inode" argument
		generic_osync_inode(), OTOH, got explicit address_space one.
That's it.
