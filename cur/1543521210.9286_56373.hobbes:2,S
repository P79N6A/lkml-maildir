   I guess the ext3 and RieserFS journalling are coded radically differently,
   then?  Have you looked much at the RFS journalling code, enough for a
   _real_ 'quick & dirty' comparison?  Just curious...
My understanding is that reseirfs suffers from the same VM issues as
ext3; both currently don't coexist well with soft-RAID (i.e. /dev/md),
because of different assumptions about how the buffer cache works, and
what devices like the MD devices are allowed to do.
