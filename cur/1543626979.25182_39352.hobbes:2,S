I think I have a first release candidate of the radix-tree pagecache for
the 2.5 tree.  This patch contains the following changes over the last version
 - improved OOM handling all over the place		(Andrew Morton)
 - minor fixes/cleanuos					(Andrew Morton, me)
 - switch mapping->page_lock to a r/w lock		(me)
The patch can be found at:
