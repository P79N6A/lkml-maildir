well you could already release binary drivers if you would be
concerned about it, so again all that seems to be no reason for me.
What stops Hauppauge in implementing drivers another way?
For example the USB drivers completly in userspace.

For example the UIO thing, accessing MMIO through userspace, also
accessing usb control messages from userspace. Because of that reason
since it is already possible to provide binary drivers your reason is
again not valid.
The code which the userspace tuners are connected to is GPL so what.
Beside that Hauppauge is not the only company out there although I also
have contacts there at Hauppauge Europe.

Please point me to the part where I am passionated about protecting
any of my opensource code which is currently available.
I have other arguments why to put that part into userspace.

just to achieve what you're trying to argue with that companies could
use some odd constructs which could be used to publish their drivers as
binary only. I don't see the problem there if they want to do so.

my experience is that there's no way of discussing things properly
with some guys there. Hey if someone wants to get his device work
somehow he's invited to join the whole project, what happened with
that project during the last 2 years (and probably before already)
does not seem to be an open community to anything.

I'm not sure if you are aware of that userspace usb video driver which got
published on the video4linux mailinglist. It hijacked ioctl calls and used usbfs
for having the whole driver in userspace.
I would like you to have a look at:
http://www.harmwal.nl/pccam880/
"This is a user space video4linux driver for the PC-CAM 880 and other
Zoran/Coach based USB webcams"

it helps to virtualize devices and introduces newer features for that.
Some interesting projects could be derrived out of that, there are
quite a few interesting papers floating around how drivers could be
handled in future.

I've seriously seen where senior devs lead other people during the last year,
repeatly pointing to wrong solutions and finally redoing things a completly
other way. Protecting their own interests and not seriously looking to get
more people on board for fixing up those API issues.

It doesn't really work out to work with those 3-5 "core" people who are active
there.
It starts at the point where RFCs are submitted and not answered,
discussions are avoided and finally some people start to complain.
In case of pointing people to wrong or bad solutions, one "Maintainer"
pointed out it would be like manipulating others work ... this exactly
happened with the em28xx project. It's not only about the current
implementation, as from my side I also take upcoming products into
account and how long it would take to get something which isn't
supported by the API fixed.. it's just something that is too hard and
I don't want to debate about things where I know that the outcome
is that I have to wait till someone of those 3-5 "core" people come up
with an own idea.
This is my impression of the overall situation you might
try to change it during the next few months but in case of further
implementations I will for sure try to get around that situation because
in history I only received nontechnical arguments why my stuff wasn't
accepted (again this starts at the RFCs).
If you want to comment this, please take all parts of that response into
account, especially the userspace v4l driver which I pointed to.
