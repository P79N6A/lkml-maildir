This does the job well:
1. except for rename, inodes on disk are long-term stable
2. inodes are stable for open files, even when renamed
With "open" meaning any process on the system and "inode number"
being what is reported to normal processes, the rules are:
1. Inodes are dir entry coordinates.
2. After rename, inode numbers change as soon as the file is not open.
3. If a new file gets a slot that gives it an inode which conflicts
   with the reported inode of an open file, report something else
   (really _anything_ else) until both files are no longer open.
Compared to silly_rename this is clean and easy, but it does leave
a larger (infinite vs. milliseconds) window during which a crash
would leave lost clusters.
Oh, no matter what is done here the FAT cache changes seem right.
