Right.  So having a single bit that was set and cleared wouldn't work
because it could get interpreted incorrectly for multiple pages.  But,
what about a lock?

While something like the following wouldn't be scalable, it would
functionally work, right?
+static void __page_discard(struct page *page)
+{
+	spin_lock(discard_lock);
...
+	spin_unlock(discard_lock);
+}
+void __delete_from_swap_cache(struct page *page)
+{
+	spin_lock(discard_lock);
...
+	spin_unlock(discard_lock);
+}
+void __remove_from_page_cache(struct page *page)
+{
+	spin_lock(discard_lock);
...
+	spin_unlock(discard_lock);
+}
