Not every printk() needs a loglevel.  For example:
	printk (KERN_WARN "blah...");
	some stuff...
	printk ("bleh...");
	more stuff...
	printk ("done\n");
is used in a lot of areas.
You'll also see:
#ifdef VERBOSE_DEBUG
#define FOO_DEBUG(a, b) printk ("%s: %s\n", a, b)
#else
#define FOO_DEBUG(a, b)
#endif
which is normally only used for debug builds.
The logging levels are, for the most part, common sense.  KERN_ERR for error 
conditions, KERN_INFO for informational (i. e. "driver just loaded", "new disk 
detected"), KERN_CRIT if your computer just caught on fire (!), and KERN_DEBUG for 
any kind of verbose printing.
