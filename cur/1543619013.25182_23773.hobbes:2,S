	Let me guess.... the Compaq Presario 700 series? Yes people
are aware that there is problem with sound on these machines.  There
are a few people trying to figure out what the problem is, but no
breakthrough yet has been made that I'm aware of.
	I think it's unlikely that the "volume buttons" actually
control anything in hardware. They are most probably just read
by some software in windows that then adjusts the volume. I think
the driver from compaq calls them Easy Access buttons or something
like that, I don't mess around in windows much anymore.  
	Also if you're using 2.4.17, if you are compiling with CPU
set to Athlon in the kernel config you'll want to be running one
of the 2.4.18pre kernels to correct a problem in the chipsets. You
can also get around this problem by selecting a lesser CPU in the
configuration. If you don't do either of these things you'll
quickly see Opps and programs randomly crashing when you start
to push your system.
