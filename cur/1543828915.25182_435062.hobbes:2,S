The main question was answered by Ben, so this may be a bit
offtopic, but I'll answer git questions anyway.
The author-name-email, subject, and author-date are taken from
the RFC2822 headers of the e-mail the committer feeds git-am,
but you can override them by having "From: ", "Subject: ", and
"Date: " as the first lines of the message body, like this:
    From: "For W. Arder" <forwarder@example.com>

    Subject: eth1394: replace __constant_htons by htons
    ...and __constant_ntohs, __constant_ntohl, __constant_cpu_to_be32 too
    where possible.  Htons and friends are resolved to constants in these
    places anyway.  Also fix an endianess glitch in a log message, spotted
    by Alexey Dobriyan.

Note that the latter three header-looking lines are not RFC2822
headers but part of your (eh, Mr Arder's) message body.
