Excellent tip, thanks.  I was able to reprodce the problem several times 
using this technique with nc, however the problem was intermittent (as 
nasty problems like this often are).  I used a 1.3G gzipped tarball and 
  experienced several botched transfers along with a few good ones.  To 
be fair, I also switched back to 100Fdx and repeated; I didn't get a 
single failure at this speed over 25 or so runs.
The results of two cmp's are here:

What next?
