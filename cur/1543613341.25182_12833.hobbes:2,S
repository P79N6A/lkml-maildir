Martin, you said you had asked some person named "Carsten" to write
the S390 entries.  Would you give me his email address, please?
ARM guys, I got nine entries from one of your people recently, but as
you can see there is still a little work to be done.  Please help me
wrap this up.

[The disarming of citizens] has a double effect, it palsies the hand
and brutalizes the mind: a habitual disuse of physical forces totally
destroys the moral [force]; and men lose at once the power of
protecting themselves, and of discerning the cause of their
oppression.
