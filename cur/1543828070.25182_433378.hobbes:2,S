Hi, I've found a problem with kernels after 2.6.13.5.
I have an old (2001) laptop. Any kernel I tried:
2.6.14
2.6.14.7
2.6.15.7
2.6.16.2
2.6.16.9
2.6.16.16
2.6.16.20
2.6.17-rc6
if I enable "APM support" I get a freeze at the very beginning of the
boot, without any explicit erro message, just after the PCI stuff. If
you need a transcript of the messages at boot, let me know, I will have
to write them by hand).
2.6.13.5 is ok. I need APM support to let the "Fn" key and the battery
meter work!
I'm not subscribed to the lkml so please, CC me.
Thank you
Alessio Sangalli
