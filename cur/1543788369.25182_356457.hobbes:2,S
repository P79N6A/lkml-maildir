Andi is right ... if you follow the "acpi_os_release_lock" trail, you
eventually get to include/asm-ia64/system.h with the following definition
for __local_irq_restore:
#define __local_irq_restore(x)  ia64_intrin_local_irq_restore((x) & IA64_PSR_I)
and the IA64_PSR_I bit is bit 14 ... safely in the low 32 bits.  So this is
a correct fix, but will have no effect on ia64.
