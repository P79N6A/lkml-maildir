It does not have to be done for each distribution. Modify the SysVinit
package directly to support this feature. All init needs to do is bind
itself to the allowed processors prior to its first fork(). This can be
done as part of the core init package, and thus all distributions
automatically reap the benefits.
If init is not modified, then it can be done in rc.d or wherever by
hand.

Things which can be done in user-space should be done in user-space.
There is absolutely zero reason to do this in the kernel.  init can do
it.
Submit a patch to the init maintainer to have it bind itself on boot to
a given command line value. Maybe I will do this if I find the time...
