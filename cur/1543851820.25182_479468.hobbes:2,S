I'm a little out of my depth here (obviously) but why is it "better" to
require a version check rather than the kernel simply flagging the
function change?  Rather like HAVE_COMPAT_IOCTL.
With the proposed 1-line kernel patch my drivers build against kernels
back to 2.6.9 (the earliest I have around here) without any version
checking.

Ah. I don't use the *regs arg.  The one line patch just keeps the
compiler happy. And provides a "tidy" way to detect the interface
change if necessary.

Oh well.
Thanks for your time,
