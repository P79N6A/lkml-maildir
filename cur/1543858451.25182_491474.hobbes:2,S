The FUSE file system interface provides a clean disciplined interface
which allows an fs to live in user space. The uio layer (if its ever
fixed and cleaned up) provides some basic hooks that allow a user space
program to arbitarily control hardware and make a nasty undebuggable mess.
uio also doesn't handle hotplug, pci and other "small" matters.
Now if you wanted to make uio useful at minimum you would need
-  PCI support
-  The ability to mark sets of I/O addresses for the card as
"unmappable", "read only", "read-write", "any read/root write", "root
read/write"
-  A proper IRQ handler
-  A DMA interface
-  The ability to describe sharing rules
Which actually is a description of the core of the DRM layer.
