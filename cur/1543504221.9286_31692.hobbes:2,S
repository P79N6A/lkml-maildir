Curious...
 Q> # echo 8k14318180 12 / 65536 /p | dc
 Q> 18.20650736

...since that also gives ~18.2 ticks per second, thus confirming my
claim that the MSDOS standard is ~18.2 ticks per second, rather than
one tick every 18.2 ms as claimed by the original poster.
For reference...
 Q> # echo 2k 1000 18.2 /p | dc
 Q> 54.94

...18.2 ticks per second corresponds to a tick every ~55 ms, not every
18.2 ms as was claimed.
Best wishes from Riley.
