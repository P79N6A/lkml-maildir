I'd really like feedback from people when it comes to this
change. The change /should/ fix most paging performance bugs
because it makes kswapd do the right amount of work in order
to solve the free memory shortage every time it is run.
This, in turn, should make it far less likely that user processes
will *ever* need to call try_to_free_pages() themselves, unless
the system really goes into overload mode.
It would be good to know if this change really fixes the bug or
if it only helps for certain workloads and not for others. I'd
really like to close the following bug but need confirmation
that it works first ;)
