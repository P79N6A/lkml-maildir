Ah, now (due to your explanation below) I see! But then how do you
explain that those old "small page" devices do support multiple writes
to a single page?

Well, after your last explanation I'm not sure myself how I've read that
into your statements ;)

I doubt block is relevant here, otherwise there seems to be no reason to
introduce "page" as a write unit in the first place. It seems that write
voltage is applied to entire page, and bit 1 in the data indeed leaks
some charge (less than 1/4 of those bit 0 leaks). I think block in this
context is mentioned only because it's impossible to erase single page.
