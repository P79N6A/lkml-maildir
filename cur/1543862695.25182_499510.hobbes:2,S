Agreed that the #ifdefs are rather ugly, but they were the smallest change.
Whoever wrote the original compat changes was relying on the IOC
constants being different for 32- and 64-bit userspace. This allowed the
lazy reuse of the whole ioctl function rather than having to write a complete
replacement compat_ioctl for fops.

The constants are only visible under CONFIG_COMPAT. I think they
should stay that way.

Other things I considered:
3. write a wrapper compat function that calls the original, make the
original pure 64-bit
4. macroise the case labels away somehow
5. update cmd in place (cannot do this as it re-used in the third switch)
6. add real_cmd and switch on that instead (your 2.),
   requires yet another switch and #ifdef.
It might be nicer to decode the IOC constants and use action, size and R/W flags
to control all the switches. Not sure myself.
Giuliano.
