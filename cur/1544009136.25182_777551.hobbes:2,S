This bit is crap, plain and simple.  d_count doesn't work as a proxy for
"how many times had we opened this file".  At all.
a) stat(2) and just about anything else that looks funny at the pathname
will bump d_count.
b) there may be several links to given file; all will share inode and have
different dentries.
In other words, result of that comparison happens to be junk.
