Agreed. But can't distro's give two SET's of RPMS:
   1. kernel-xyz.rpm
   2. kernel-xyz-debug.rpm
where both 1,2 are same kernels compiled w/ same config and with -g.
BUT rpm [1] is a 'strip -g' output of [2]. 
So people run [1] on their production systems. And developers analyze
core-dump from these systems using [2]. Can this be done and will it
work?
Thanks in advance,

A.
