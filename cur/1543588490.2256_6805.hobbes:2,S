One of the problems this `overdesign' can help solve is actually identifying
the parts that have semi-permanent maintainers, and the parts that don't.
One way to use the meta-information, for example, would be to use it to 
periodically poll maintainers to find out if they're still active.
Another is to be able to generate reports on exactly how much of the kernel
is in "Maintained" or "Supported" status.  I think it would be worth 
making this change just so we could know that.
