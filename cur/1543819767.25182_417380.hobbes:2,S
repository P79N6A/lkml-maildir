Hi Serge.  
We have lmbench results.  We had issues getting reproducability out of dbench
but need to look at it some more. The lmbench figures we presently have are 
from the old code (reader writer lock).  Results were good but we recently 
converted to rcu for the reader dominated rw locks.
I'm not sure there is "0 performance hit for unconfined" as you have to check
for them being unconfined :) but it's low.
If you have other benchmarks we are open to suggestions. What has been used
to benchmark SELinux?
Anyways, we need to regenerate the results, we'll try and post in the next
couple days.  ok?
Thanks
Tony
