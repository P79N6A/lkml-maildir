Hi!
Given that telephony device is nothing but soundcard with few more
functions, and slightly obscure format, why is not drivers/telephony
more similar to drivers/audio?
It gives sense to splay -d /dev/telephony0 /big/something.mp3, it
gives sense to record sounds from telephony line with exactly same
software you grab from soundcard. Yes, ixj is able to do fancy things
like DTMF detection in hardware, but don't expect that from DSP-less
winmodems. (And I'd expect winmodems to go just into
drivers/telephony, or not?)
