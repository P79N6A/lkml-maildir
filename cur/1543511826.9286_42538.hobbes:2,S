Hello,
  I had a similiar problem with the aic7xxx driver with regards to 2.2.11. My problem was caused
by my drive:
Host: scsi0 Channel: 00 Id: 00 Lun: 00
  Vendor: WDIGTL   Model: ENTERPRISE       Rev: 1.43
  Type:   Direct-Access                    ANSI SCSI revision: 02
This was because with TCQ and this drive did not work. I found 2 solutions to my problem.
1. I rolled out all patches 2.2.11 applied to the scsi branch of the kernel tree.
2. I upgraded to 2.3.18. 
In my OPION the best answer is 2.3.18. It is a better kernel and seems to me more stable. The only
problem I had with 2.3.18 is I had to upgrade my ppp utilities. Note i DO NOT suggest the use of
2.2.12 as I found problems in the math section of the emulator library.
Please note my experiences are on the Alpha/AXP system but this should map well to other more
"primative" platforms. :)
