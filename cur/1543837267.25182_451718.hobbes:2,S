Bayes and distributed filtering in SpamAssassin, although it integrates
nicely with the scoring, is so painfully slow that I've ditched it after
a short test drive. Systems such as bogofilter, spamprobe or qsf are way
faster - and can also look at tags that SpamAssassin (in local non-bayes
mode) may have added to the header.
