There is a problem with the calling cancel_rearming_delayed_work if the 
timer was not yet active.
I see this problem when netpoll_cleanup() is called without having done 
any work because it had not processed any packets yet.  The problem 
appears to be a result of the loop check 
while(!cancel_delayed_work(dwork)).    This endlessly loops because 
del_timer_sync() can return 0 or 1 for success which is passed back as a 
result to the final invariant check for the loop.  In this particular 
case zero will always be returned because the timer is not active.
It is possible that the problem exists else where, but I thought I would 
ask if this is expected?

Possible fix.
