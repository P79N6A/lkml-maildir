Hmmm...  Might one make a theoretical proof that assumed the absense
of bugs?  Wholly unrealistic, I know, but seems like a reasonable
question to ask.  Besides, isn't theory -supposed- to be wholly
unrealistic?

SMP does make it more complex, but not hopeless.  If you can bound the
number of threads, and if you can guarantee FIFO queuing on locks,
then the locks can have bounded wait times.  Not that any of the
high-performance spinlocks actually have this property...

OK.  I suppose you could migrate it back as soon as it returned to
user-mode execution.  Might or might not be useful.  The other approach
would be once it dropped all of its locks, but, as you say, this could
result in a large number of migrations...

It can be quite light-weight -- you just have to carefully lie to the
OS about what CPU it is running on.  And no doubt fix a bunch of places
where it makes assumptions about the two CPUs being real CPUs.  :-(
