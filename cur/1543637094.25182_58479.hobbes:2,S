        Okay.. I have to ask the question.. Which version of IDE does 2.5.27 
have? you're saying IDE 99. According to the changelog Linus threw out with 
2.5.27:
Martin Dalecki <dalecki@evision-ventures.com>:
  o 2.5.26 IDE 99
  o IDE 100
        With this, I'm assuming 2.5.27 has IDE 100 in it, patched up from IDE 
99. Correct me if I'm wrong.
                                                        BL.
