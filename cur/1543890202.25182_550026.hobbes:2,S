Sure, but if any of these drivers run on PPC then they're broken anyway. 
The assumption that processes will be frozen during suspend is true in 
the specific case of ACPI and some of the ARM platforms, but not true on 
PPC or APM systems. We either need to fix the drivers to stop assuming 
this or add the process freezer to the other PM systems. Right now, 
they're buggy.
