The tests that I wrote emulate the test behavior that was described to me 
by me.
The fixes in 2.6.24-rc5-mm1 improved those numbers. See 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/27/245
 which I quoted earlier to you. 
However, I have no TPC-C setup here and from what I hear it takes weeks to 
run and requires a large support team for tuning.
You can find the slab test suite for that at
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/christoph/vm.git;a=shortlog;h=tests
AFAICT the fixes in 2.6.25-rc5-mm1 result in double the alloc performance 
(fastpath) of SLAB.
There are fixes that are not merged yet (the cpu alloc patchset) that 
seem to make that factor 3 because we can use the segment register to 
avoid per cpu array lookups in the fast path.
