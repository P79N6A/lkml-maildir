I think it's too late for that in the current series, but yes, we could do 
it for 2.6.18.
There are a few valid reasons for not using SA_SHIRQ, but they tend to be 
really special. Ie you'd better _know_ that you're either some system 
device, or you're physically in an ISA slot, not just based on some old 
ISA design. And PCMCIA is no longer an excuse, exactly because of some 
systems that will route even the 16-bit interrupts through a PCI irq.
So anything in arch/ is likely ok (for example, the vm86 interrupt 
handling on x86 had _better_ be an exclusive interrupt ;)
Doing a quick grep shows a surprising amount of drivers that pass in zero, 
but I guess that they truly _are_ old ISA sound/networking drivers.
