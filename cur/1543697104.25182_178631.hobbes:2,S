Hello
While trying to fix tmscsim for 2.6, I've arrived at the Oops below, which
is caused by the BUG_ON() in dma_map_page(). In the backtrace below,
data_direction is set to DMA_BIDIRECTIONAL in sd_revalidate_disk(),
                sreq->sr_data_direction = DMA_BIDIRECTIONAL;
, but already in sd_spinup_disk() it is reset to DMA_NONE:
                        SRpnt->sr_data_direction = DMA_NONE;
So, the question is: is this the correct behaviour, and, if so - how is
the driver supposed to map this request - which direction to pass to
dma_map_*?
Thanks
Guennadi
