Okay.  One note about the above results: as Zach pointed out, my
2.95.3 number for "maps" was wrong.  I must have forgotten to collect
the data but thought I had.  In fact, there are ~10 lines in "maps"
for the 2.95.3 "cc1plus" process.  The other "maps" numbers for 3.0
and 2.96 are correct, at least within an order of magnitude.
Under 2.4.3-pre7, I get the following disappointing numbers:
    CVS gcc 3.0:          Debian gcc 2.95.3:   RedHat gcc 2.96:
    real    16m10.660s    real    7m58.874s    real    10m36.368s
    user    15m27.900s    user    7m23.090s    user    10m0.290s 
    sys     0m48.400s     sys     0m40.350s    sys     0m40.790s 
maps:   <20 lines             ~10 lines            ~10 lines
A huge win for 2.96 and absolutely no benefit whatsoever for 3.0, even
though it obviously had a 10-fold effect on maps counts.  On the
positive side, there was no performance *hit* either.
As a blind "have not looked at relevant kernel source" guess, this
looks like a hash scaling problem to me: the hash size works great for
~300 maps and falls apart in a major way at ~3000 maps, presumably
when we get multiple hits per hash bin and start walking 10-member
lists.
How this translates into a course of action---some combination of
keeping your patch, enlarging the hash, and performance tweaking the
list-walking---I'm not sure.
