Subject: [patch 088/104] jbd2: Fix buffer head leak when writing the commit block
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/3/375

2.6.27-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
From: "Theodore Ts'o" <tytso@mit.edu>
(cherry picked from commit 45a90bfd90c1215bf824c0f705b409723f52361b)
Also make sure the buffer heads are marked clean before submitting bh
for writing.  The previous code was marking the buffer head dirty,
which would have forced an unneeded write (and seek) to the journal
for no good reason.
