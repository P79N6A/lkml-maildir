Hi,
This is the right patch which will not touch original tty logic. Please ignore last one submited by me.
Regards
dave
Subject:
rfcomm_dev_del could be called twice time in release function.
one by rfcomm_tty_hangup, another by rfcomm_release_dev, this will cause the device being destructed before rfcomm_tty_close.
