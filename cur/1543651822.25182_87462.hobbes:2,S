For some reason your mtrr table was not covering the last 32 megabytes
of memory.  Probably you could also have fixed this by altering the
mtrr settings.  See Documentation/mtrr.txt in the kernel source tree.

You have to use it for something else :)
Sorry, Linux will only leave a few megabytes of memory unused,
for emergency and interrupt-time allocations.
Why is this a problem?
