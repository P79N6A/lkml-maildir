Booting the machine isn't the kernel's job, it's the bootloader's job.

Yes.
It is very dangerous to attempt a resume with a different kernel than the one
that has gone to sleep.
Different kernels may be compiled with different options that affect where or
how in-memory structures are saved.
So you suspend with a kernel which holds your filesystem data/cache/inodes at
0x1234000 and restore with a kernel that expects to see your filesystem data at
0x1235000.
Ouch.
Personally I think the kernel suspend should write a signature - similar to a
hash of the bzImage - into the suspend image so it won't even attempt a resume
if there's a mismatch. (Yes, I made this mistake once whilst playing with suspend).
