That is not correct. The default xclk for the Rage Mobility M1 is
125 MHz and this is indeed the case, for example on Geert's VAIO.
See also the e-mail below from Vernon Chiang from ATi.
On x86, I usually ask a copy of the video driver to be able to check the
driver information table of that particular implementation. Do you have
something similair from the Open Firmware?

Hi Daniel,
I've gotten confirmation that the Rage Mobility P/M engine/clock setting
should be
125MHz/83MHz.
The ltmodset program is correct.
Thanks.
