I can see volunteers line up already with this kind of incentive (-:
Sorry, already have a not so trustable SATA controller, a possibly broken IDE  
disk in a software raid5 array, and just survived another SCSI disk crash. 
This one will pass me by by lack of the mentioned controller. If someone 
sends me one, I don't have problem with testing it, machines and disks 
enough.
