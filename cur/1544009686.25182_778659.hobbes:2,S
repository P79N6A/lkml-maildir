What's wrong in having a signalfd on SIGCHLD, than doing waitpid() once 
you get the signal? Do you have cases where this wouldn't be OK?
About the code, eventually, you really want to report the PID of the 
exited child, together with the status. So maybe a non-compat-requiring 
struct would be better to be returned by read(2).

Trust the compiler, it's pretty good in not having you to add Perl-like 
extra brackets ;)
This also looks wierd:
	} if (value == -ECHILD) {
So maybe:
	return value > 0 || value == -ECHILD ? POLLIN: 0;

... looks like you're returning a sequence of status ints, with wrong data 
size returned by read(2).

Please leave space for extra flags for fds, otherwise Uli will have to 
make another sys_waitfd3().

Given that you blinded copied this from sys_wait4(), you may want to at 
least try to make sys_wait4() to re-use the new function.
Also, your patch does not apply to latest Linus tree. Which one was the 
base?
