Just taking a quick look at pktcdvd that does appear to be a case where
we want to express to the rest of the system that our block device has
a > 2KB block size.
I think it would be very useful to express to the rest of the system
that yes indeed this device has a 32K sector size (or whatever the
real limit is) instead of hiding that fact away.
Now I'm not a block layer expert and my knowledge of the page cache
is rusty.  So I can't immediately point to a way we can do this.
I'll guess that it will require cleaning up some old crufty code that
no one wants to touch.
I will point out that while this appears to require support from
upper levels it also does not require a larger physical page size
in the page cache.
Am I correct in assuming that the problem is primarily about getting
filesystems (and other upper layers) to submit BIOs that take into
consideration the larger block size of the underlying device, so
that read/modify write is not needed in the pktcdvd layer?
