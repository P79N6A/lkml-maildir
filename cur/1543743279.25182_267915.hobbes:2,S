Using the simple class tty kobject that tty_io.c keeps might work for my
needs.
However, there is one thing that stopped me from using it earlier...
The naming of the directory (tty name) in /sys/class/tty is forced to
be:
"sprintf(p, "%s%d", driver->name, index + driver->name_base);"
Is it possible we could change this to be more relaxed about the naming
scheme?
Maybe we can allow a "custom" name to be sent into the
tty_register_device() call?
Like add another option parameter called "custom_name" that if non-NULL,
is used instead of the derived name?
