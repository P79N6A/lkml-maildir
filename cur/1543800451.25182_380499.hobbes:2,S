Wrong. The "nv" driver supports xvideo, and does this better than the 
official "nvidia" driver. When I had a GeForce 2 MX 200 (now this card 
is dead), my computer was was fast enough to play DVDs with 
deinterlacing with the "nv" driver, but not with "nvidia". Probably due 
to improper MTRR setup done by the "nvidia" driver.
So the original reporter was actually just lazy or misinformed about the 
capabilities of the "nv" driver.
