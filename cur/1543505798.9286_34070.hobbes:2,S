Well, I found my error and thought I would share it so other driver
writers
would not fall into the same pit.  Early on in the writing of the
driver I
allocated 4 wait queues for each card read_inq, read_outq, write_inq and
write_outq.  I ended up using only 2 of them, read_outq and write_inq.
Those are the queues that are used for blocking reads and writes, so
they
are the ones that get passed to wake_up_interruptible when buffers are
available, or there is data to read.  Unfortunately, when I added the
poll()
method, I inadvertently used the other 2, thus the compiler didn't
complain,
but select()'s never woke up until their timer timed out.  The unused
wait
queues have now been deleted.
