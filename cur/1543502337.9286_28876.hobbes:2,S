Hello All,
    I just found a bug with 2.3.10.  If I try and debug mozilla, which
uses pthreads, then after the main program starts creating threads
I get the following errors whenever I try and start up other programs:
Bessie> clear
Trace/BPT trap (core dumped)
After I exit gdb, I can run other programs again.
Mozilla is pretty large, but if anyone needs a testcase I can put one
together.
Thanks,
Jim
