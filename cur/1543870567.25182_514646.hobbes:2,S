Folks,
my Dell Inspiron 6400 laptop has both a Ricoh R5C822 host adapter (for
SD, MMC, etc.) and a Ricoh R5C592 host adapter for memory sticks.
While the former works just fine, it seems to me that the latter
hasn't any support.  Indeed, inserting a Sony MSA-128A memory stick
causes no reaction whatsoever.  Searching with google, I haven't found
anything related to this chip; looking into the kernel source code
wasn't successful either.
Can you please shed some light on the current situation?  I'm using
kernel 2.6.20.
