Subject: [PATCH 001 of 4] md: Fix recent breakage of md/raid1 array checking
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/8/24/55

A recent patch broke the ability to do a 
user-request check of a raid1.
This patch fixes the breakage and also moves a comment that
was dislocated by the same patch.
