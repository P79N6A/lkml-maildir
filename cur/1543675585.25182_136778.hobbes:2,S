Of course it would be better if code were documented in a consistent and
canonical style.  The Documentation/kernel-doc-nano-HOWTO.txt method
should probably have a one line mention in Chapter 5: Commenting, like
this:

My purpose with the original patch was to canonify the unusual style
discussed above. 
The note about the old-style K&R prototypes being deprecated is probably
redundant and may be unnecessary, unless someone is copying and pasting
from some old System V code, and we all know that makes about as much
sense as Boeing secretly looking over the blueprints for the Douglas
DC-3.
