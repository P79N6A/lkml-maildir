Ouch, this does not look healthy. You're at 'noapic'? Seems so.
Mine is:
           CPU0       CPU1       
 17:         22         17   IO-APIC-level  BusLogic BT-958
 18:      83988      84319   IO-APIC-level  Mylex AcceleRAID 160
However, I can see no indication for misbehaviour. Let's take it off 
the list. Can you send me a driver startup dmesg?
