Hi *!
What do you think about changing a number of default configuration options?
When I look around, I see many Linux users changing always the same options.
For example: Who builds his kernel without kmod support? Are there more than
10 persons working with Linux on i386 without it? I'd like see it switched
to "yes" in out default values... OTOH, why should ATAPI CDROM support be
directly compiled into kernel? It works perfectly for me having this as a
module (because _then_ you can switch to use scsi-ide in order to use 
IDE writers). And: I think we should have almost most standard options now
compiled fix-compiled into kernel as a module. It's not a broken kernel if
it doesn't do it's work, but a broken installation (->  too few aliases in
/etc/modules.conf). If you agree I'd volunteer to collect many people's
/usr/src/linux/.config in order to go the way in the middle...
Your comments?
MfG, JBG
