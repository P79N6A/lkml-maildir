This isn't a regression strictly speaking, as 2.6.21 is known to be
affected, and older kernels might also be.
It's non-fatal and only happens under very special circumstances, so
it's definitely not a showstopper.
I don't mind being bugged about this once in a while, this is just for
clarification.
