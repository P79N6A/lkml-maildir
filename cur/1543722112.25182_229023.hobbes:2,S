Why?  XFree86 has been doing its own autorepeat, I think.
        $ xset q
        Keyboard Control:
          auto repeat:  on    key click percent:  0    LED mask:  00000000
          auto repeat delay:  660    repeat rate:  25
          auto repeating keys:  00ffffffdffffbbf
                                fa9fffffffdfe5ff
                                ffffffffffffffff
                                ffffffffffffffff
          bell percent:  50    bell pitch:  400    bell duration:  100
And I  can change it via "xset  r rate [delay [rate  ]]", according to
"xset help".  Indeed,  you can use 'xset' to  change the rate/delay to
very  extreme values,  which  exceed the  hardware  allowed on  AT/PS2
keyboards (e.g. rates > 30  cps), adjusted with the 'kbdrate' command.
So, the only  possibility for these hardware limits  to be transcended
is s/w based autorepeat.
