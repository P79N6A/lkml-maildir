The kernel makes no decision to swap just because you left the
machine.  But your distro probably runs "updatedb" at night.
Updatedb reads all the directories in all your filesystems, so
it tends to use a lot of cache.  This activity pushes
lots of other stuff into swap.
You may of course change your crontab to runn updatedb less
often, or configure updatedb to skip directory
trees where you expect little change. (/usr perhaps...)
