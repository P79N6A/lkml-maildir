Rubbish.  PIO mode ATA will be around for some years to come - there
is just too much invested there (especially in the embedded world) for
it to vanish this quickly.  For example, think about compact flash cards,
many of which are still driven using PIO mode accesses in todays PDAs.
(and in some PDAs, there isn't the hardware facilities to even think
about trying any type of DMA transfer.)
