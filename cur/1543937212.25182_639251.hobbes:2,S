Not replying for Adrian, but it happened several times to me too.
What sometimes happens when we push Git updates from home is that
we don't push all the refs. Sometimes I forget to update the tags,
sometimes the master, etc...
Just looked at the git repo itself, it looks like it has not changed
since 2008/01/08 :-/
Adrian, maybe your git-push did not succeed ?
Regards,
Willy
