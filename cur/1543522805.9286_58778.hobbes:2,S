Excellent idea!  Reasons:
  - Save memory.  I estimate about 100k on my single-user PC!
	Most tasks poll/select very few descriptors.  It's quite common
	to have a /lot/ of tasks all blocked in poll or select.
	E.g. all X applications.  Why waste a page on each one, when
	only a few bytes are required?  Use a slab cache and save
	approx. 1 page per blocked task.
  - Cache line interference
	The current implementation bangs the same places in different
	pages for different tasks doing poll() at the same time.  This
	leads to cache line collisions.  A slab cache would relieve that.
  - No fd limit, for free
To keep it scalable on SMP, you'd want a per-processor slab cache.
