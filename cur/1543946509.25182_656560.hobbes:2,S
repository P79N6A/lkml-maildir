I bisected down this one commit that causes the problem with
suspend-to-disk on Lenovo X60s (i945 chipset).
commit ba8bbcf6ff4650712f64c0ef61139c73898e2165

    i915: add suspend/resume support
    Add suspend/resume support to the i915 driver.  Moves some of the
    initialization into the driver load routine, and fixes up places where we
    assumed no dev_private existed in some of the cleanup paths.  This allows
    us to suspend/resume properly even if X isn't running.

There where problem reverting the some i915 files with the latest
linux git pull, so I copied those i915*.{h,c} prior to this commit,
and problem went away.
Suspend-to-ram, suspend-to-disk all working now.
Thanks,
Jeff.
