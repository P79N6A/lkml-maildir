Hi!
I have been trying to figure out a list of supported IDE-SCSI ATAPI
tape drive devices with 2.2.X kernels.  It seems that the HP
Colorado 8 gig tape drives are supported.  Are there any higher
capacity drives supported?  I have tried Aiwa bolt 10 gig device
and Tecmar NS 20 gig devices with little success.  (A lot of
errors regarding timeouts, etc.)  
Anyone have a list of supported IDE tape devices (I have checked
the FAQ and it is rather out of date)?
