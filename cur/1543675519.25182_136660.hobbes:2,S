All,
A new version of the 8.x series driver for Linux 2.5.x kernels has
been uploaded to SourceForge:
	
http://sourceforge.net/projects/linux-qla2xxx/
This is mostly a resync in functionality with the latest 6.x beta
driver.  Additionally, there have been some file-structure changes to
the distribution package:
	o Removal of 2300 TPX firmware in favor of 2300 IPX
	  - Driver supports both FC-SCSI and IP concurrently.
		ql2300tpx.c -> ql2300ipx.c
The next driver drop will include further refinements in file
organization: FC Generic services, HBA identification table.
Changes include:
 *	- Rework PCI I/O space configuration.
 *	- ISR fast-path clean-up.
 *	- Rework IP functionality to support 2k logins.
 *	- Resync with 6.06.00b3.
 *	- Resync with Linux Kernel 2.5.70.
Regards,
Andrew Vasquez
