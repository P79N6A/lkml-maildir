Hi, there,
  I have a question regarding kernel memory mapping. During run time,
  the kernel components, e.g., modules, may allocate some pages (both
  virtual and physical) by invoking vmalloc. The mapping will be
  reflected in the swapper_pg_dir (init_mm).
  I am wondering whether such dynamically created mappings are
  propagated to other existing processes at all.
  There must be something I don't see. If you know how it is done,
  please help. Even better, if you can compare it with other OS. 
  Thanks in advance,
-- xulu
