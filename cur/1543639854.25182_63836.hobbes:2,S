That still doesn't make it any les crap: because any thread that exits 
without calling the "magic exit-flag interface" will then silently be 
lost, with no information left around anywhere.
The whole interface is bogus.
If you want to do this, you can do it at _clone_ time, by extending on the
notion of "when I die, tell the parent using signal X" and making that
notion be a more generic "when I die, do X", where "X" migh include 
updating some parent tables instead of sending a signal.
But the magic "exit_write()" has to die.
