This would be nice but I think that full info for every new hotplugged 
device is even better. It's only 1 line :-)
Lame people, like myself, will make this rule:
BUS="scsi", SYSFS_model="CD-Writer cd4f*", KERNEL="sr*", NAME="cdrw"
When I connect a second drive (same model) /udev/cdrw will be 
overwritten. So I'd want to check the logs, find some difference between 
the two and create a new entry "myfriends-cdrw".
(I know that NAME="cdrw%n" would work but that depends on the order you 
plug things).
