If you are looking seriously at this you might want to start with the
code in the OpenVZ kernel (
http://openvz.org
) that allows a VE to
"checkpoint" to disk and "restore" on the same or a different machine.
This is, as far as I can tell, a portable implementation of this that
already handles real live userspace applications moving transparently
between two machines.
It has the advantage that it lives in an orderly world where most
devices and the file system are virtual but, hey, it works right now.
