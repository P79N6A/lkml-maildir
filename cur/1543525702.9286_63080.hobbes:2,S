I see you deleted the actual quote and presented a revised statement. I
think those who read the original statement can figure out what it said.

I never mentioned FDDI, you love to put words in other people's mouths.
Those who know me would tell you I am far too much focused on change,
rather than maintaining the staus quo. You know nothing about me--so why
make it up? Will that distract from the succinct literal meaning of the
words you have posted? You often change the topic, when you bump into a
wall. No doubt many are aware of this without me literally stating it.
I have no direct interest in this at all. I do have relevant knowledge.
These ideas are not new inside the disk drive industry. Anyone who believes
this discussion is breaking new ground is deluding themself.
