Stuart,

Great, the set command works!
I do feel the problem is dos file format xfer issue.  Under Soalris or
Unixware enviornment, if the ^M is at the end of line, it will shows up.  I
have been dealing those under Unixware and Solaris a lot. However, all my
problem lines under Linux does not show anything after "\".  Even I replaced
the rest of line after last character with a "\", it still causing problem.
That confused me.  Only similar experience I had was doing Banyan driver
where the compiler gave same headache to me.
Anyway, problem resolved and many thanks to you guys!!!

Look carefully at the bottom line of your vi screen when the file first
loads.
It probably says [dos format]. Use
:set ff=unix
:w
to convert to unix format. The difference? Dos format ends a line with
\<newline>^M
where unix format just ends
\<newline>
The extra carriage return confuses the compiler; the \ needs to be followed
by a newline to be acceptable as a line-continuation marker.
