I've had this problem for a while now.  I think 'make dep' makes a
new versions.h.  It's possible you have to make dep twice...I
forget.
Oh...to get make dep to work the first time, just touch the
versions.h file.
I make my .config file using 'make menuconfig'.  This is on at
least 2.3.36 and stretchs back a bit...
