I had this problem with the kernel debugger when it was triggered
by an ALT-SYSRQ sequence.     It turned out that I was calling the
debugger on the keypress and since the debugger accessed the keyboard
controller directly it was eating (and ignoring) the release code 
for the SYSRQ key (so a subsequent ALT-SYSRQ combination was required
to clear the ALT-SYSRQ state after leaving the debugger).  For this
reason, amongst others, I changed the kdb interrupt character to the
PAUSE key :-).
I suspect that the X-Server is eating the release codes for the 
ALT-SYSRQ sequence (i.e. it isn't coordinated with keyboard.c).   You
can reset this condition with ALT-SYSRQ.
