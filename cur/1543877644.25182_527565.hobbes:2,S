Hi Steven,
	This is a cool idea, but there are two issues with this patch.  The
first is that it's 500 lines of code: that's around +10% on lguest's
total code size!  The second is that it conflicts with the medium-term
plan to allow any user to run up lguests: this is why lg.ko never
printk()s about problems with the guest.
While it is useful for cases where a guest dies mysteriously before it
brings up the console, three alternatives come to mind:
1) Modify early_printk so Guests can use it.
2) Have a separate tool(-set?) for this kind of post-mortem.  Then you
just have to implement guest suspend! 8)
3) Put this in a CONFIG_LGUEST_DEBUG.
Note that options 1 or 2 make you do more work, but are probably better
in the long term.  I'm happy for #3 to sit as a patch in the tree for
the duration, tho!
Cheers,
Rusty.
