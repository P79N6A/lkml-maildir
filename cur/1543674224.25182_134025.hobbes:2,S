Sure.  It's be good to see an ia32 implementation which can be beaten on. 
Maybe John can look into that?
From an implementation point of view, I wonder if all platforms will need
the indirection?
If not then it would be better to just do
	update_wall_time_hook(sys_tz.tz_minuteswest * 60 * NSEC_PER_SEC);
in kernel/time.c and let the architecture decide whether it wants to add
the extra overwriteable hooks.
So include/asm/time-interpolation.h has:
	#include <asm-generic/time-interpolation.h>
and asm-generic/time-interpolation.h has:
	struct time_interpolator {
		...
	}
	static inline void update_wall_time_hook(unsigne long nsec)
	{
		time_interpolator.update_wall_time(nsec);
	}
if you get my drift.
