I think that's a separate issue?  As Jeff points out, those macros are 
intended to provide memory vs. I/O ordering, but isn't PPC the only platform 
that will reorder accesses so aggressively and independently?  I don't think 
ia64 for example will reorder them separately, so a regular memory barrier 
*should* be enough to ensure ordering in both domains.

Yeah, either way.  Not sure if adding more I/O examples to the existing doc is 
better or worse than an I/O specific document.

Sure, that's fair.  If any potential application of the more precise semantics 
is just theoretical, we may as well limit our guarantees to locks only.

Yeah, that's true (I see your point about being more worried about other 
things on PPC as well ;).

Either way is fine with me as long as we have a way to get at the fast and 
loose stuff (and required barriers of course) in a portable way.  And that we 
don't regress the existing users of mmiowb().

Oh right, a flag would be enough.  Is it good enough for -mm yet?  Might be 
fun to run on an Altix machine with a bunch of supported devices (not that I 
work with them anymore...).

Right, but unless there's a real need at this point, we probably shouldn't 
bother.  Let the poor sucker with the future machine needing the device 
argument do the work. :)
Thanks,
