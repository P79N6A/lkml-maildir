Wouldn't it make more sense to extend the current framebuffer driver
support to support v-sync? (framebuffers are already in the kernel, and
there were so many security holes with svgalib-based programs that it left
a bad taste in a lot of people's mouths)
And having gotten a v-sync interrupt, what would you *do* with it?
You'll need an API here....
