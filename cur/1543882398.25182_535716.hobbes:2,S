Nevertheless, thanks for your efforts and time spent. You did a great
job and I hope you can convince yourself to carry on.

Nobody is satisfied with pending regressions. I can completely
understand your frustration, but you need to adjust your expectations on
that as well.
Your regression lists are extremly useful, as they point folks like me
to the burning points. I try to follow LKML as far as I can, but I have
to admit that I occasionally go the easy way of marking 10000 mails as
read in one go after a week of travelling. I don't do this to my
personal inbox, so your mails get my attention.

That happens all the time. I have a dozen of boxen around and I can't do
tests on all of them continously. So trapping into some known regression
is nothing which surprises me.

Yes, it's a conflict, but one that is unresolvable except we want to go
back to the 2.4 model which sucked way more than the current one.

Maybe we need to coordinate changes better. 2.6.21 got three big updates
which affected suspend/resume - one of them is my fault. But fiddling
out which one of those - we had nested problems as well - makes it quite
hard to grok them in time, especially if they happen only on one
reporters system.
Your reports are not invalid, when Linus releases a final. They are
still there and worked on.
I believe we are getting better at that, and one reason for this is your
relentless effort to poke the experts^culprits to actually solve the
problems.

Please take a couple of days to reconsider. I personally would welcome
if you carry on.
Thanks,
