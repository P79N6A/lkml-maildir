What's wrong with the aic7xxx driver storing the "user", "goal", and
"current" transfer negotiation settings for a device in a structure
with fields by those names?  Nothing save the fact that "current" is
a #define in linux.
Anyway, I've said my peace.  The driver will properly work around
the namespace problem.
