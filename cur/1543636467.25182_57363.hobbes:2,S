Good summary. The problem is that 3a either requires a double morror or
leaving the f/s un mirrored, and 3b can take a very long time for a big
f/s.
In general mauch of this can be addressed by only backing up small f/s and
using an application backup utility to backup the big stuff. Fortunately
the most common problem apps are databases and and they include this
capability.
