Linus indicated (maybe privately) that the end of his BK usage would
be immediately after the -rc2 release.  I'm taking that to mean "no
more BK usage from Linus, period."
Thinking about it a bit, if you're asking Linus to pull your tree,
Linus would then have to extract the individual change sets as patches
to put into his new fangled patch management system.  Is that a
reasonable expectation?
However, it's ultimately up to Linus to decide. 8)
