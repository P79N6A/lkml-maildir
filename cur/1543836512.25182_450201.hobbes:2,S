Well late to the dicussion, but I still want to point out that forcing
a boolean type of a different size upon existing kernel code is not
always a great idea and can have nasty side effects for struct
alignments. Not to mention that on some architectures, accessing a u1
is a lot slower than accessing an int. If a developer really wants to
use the smaller type he/she should do so explicitly being aware of the
impact.
The kernel is written in C, not C++ or Jave or some other broken
language and C doesn't have 'bool'. This patch falls under the
'typedefs considered evil' or typedef for the sake of typedef, if you
ask me.
Regards,
Jes
