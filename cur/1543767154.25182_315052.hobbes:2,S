I run 64 threads dbench on a 4way box on a 90% full filesystem, patched
kernel is slightly faster. I think part of the reason is on a 90% full
filesystem, block bitmap scan will take a long time. Thus drop the lock
before bitmap scan will help, although there are some overhead of
drop/re-grab lock and extra window search/link/unlink before we found a
window with free block.  On a freshly created filesystem where the
regression is seen, the bitmap scan takes shorter time, thus the
overhead of drop/re-grab lock and extra window search/link/unlink
probably is probably be outstanding. 
I also run 1000 dd tests in parallel, each of them writing to different
file(2M size). Seems no gain or no regression.
Anyway, we should not hold the global reservation lock while scanning
the bitmap, that's a scalability issue and a latency issue. To drop the
lock during bitmap scan we need to do extra work, I don't think it's
avoidable.  Andrew, could you add it to mm tree? I will re-send the
patch with the change log.
Thanks,
Mingming
