It's repeatable under anything other than 2.6.8-rc4-mm1, the earliest 
kernel I have here. As a test, I attached another cdrom as hdd and got 
the same oops under 2.6.9-rc1-bk15, same problem and as far as I can 
tell anything from 2.6.8.1 onwards gives the same fault.
Now running under 2.6.8-rc4-mm1 without problems, so it looks like a 
kernel bug.
