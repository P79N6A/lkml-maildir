"POSIX says" has value only if there is at least some consensus among
implementations.  Otherwise it's worthless, simply because any program
that cares about portability can't rely on specified behaviour and
any program that doesn't couldn't care less anyway - it will rely on
actual behaviour on system it's supposed to run on.
Andries had shown that there is _no_ consensus.  Ergo, POSIX can take
a hike and we should go with the behaviour convenient for us.  It's that
simple...
