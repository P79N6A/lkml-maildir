So why are you mouting with hard,intr semantics?  At my current
SysAdmin job, we mount everything (solaris included) with 'soft,intr'
and it works well.  If an NFS server goes down, clients don't hang for
large periods of time.

 is cycles of "kill processes" and

I think the man pages are out of date, or ignoring reality.  Try
mounting with soft,intr and see how it works for you.  I think you'll
be happy.
