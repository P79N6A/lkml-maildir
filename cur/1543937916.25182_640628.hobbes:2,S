My limited understanding of markers is that you can attach something to
them that later work out any semantics you may want to associate with
them.
So I guess that as soon as the outermost marker is reached you can
just bump a counter and when the (several) inner markers are reached and
the counter is not zero you just bump it and go on with life, leaving
the latency measurement being done to the "owner" (outermost) marker.
Frank, am I talking bullshit?
