Yes, please let us know what your benchmarking measurements show.  I
take it you are planning on doing something like:
--- a/drivers/scsi/qla2xxx/qla_os.c
+++ b/drivers/scsi/qla2xxx/qla_os.c
@@ -1101,10 +1101,7 @@ qla2xxx_slave_configure(struct scsi_devi

 	struct fc_rport *rport = starget_to_rport(sdev->sdev_target);
