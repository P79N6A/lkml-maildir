certainly not more quickly than a flood of allocation of highmem pages
in anon mem. I don't see your point. kmap has to work just fine over
there and the __cli/__sti was obviously useless. (should be faster
because we won't need to invlpg at every bounce, but OTOH we'll flush
the whole tlb after the wrap around but as said above if flushing the
tlb too frequently is the issue we should simply improve kmap because
the flood of kmap will happen anyways in the very fast paths regardless
of the bounces)
