For subsystems specific dependency problems, a field as follow can be
added into struct device:
struct device *depend;
The parallel device probing code will not do probing for the device,
unless the device pointed by "depend" has been probed, that is, they are
probed serially. As for IEEE 1394 subsystem, when the subsystem adds new
devices, the different units on the same node are linked together with
the "depend" field, so that they can be probed serially. So do other
subsystems.
>Also, how can subsystems enable and disable multithreaded probes?
If subsystem needs strictly serial probing, it can accomplish this
through "depend" field as mentioned above.

Sorry, I will add it in the next version.
