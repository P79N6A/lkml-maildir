 Im my case P-MTU discovery and fragmentation should be ruled out, but
 sacks are really frequent: my hosts are connected via poor leased line.

 I only wrote that it was active when got stuck. It may be idle before -
 I do not remember, but have a habit to keep connections for weeks. :)
 As my experiments show, any connection, entering keepalive once,
 have lose its ability to send zero probes - forever.

 OK. Let us return to the "mss/mtu bug". The most mystifying thing for
 me is the dependance of the MTU threshold on the kernel version, etc.
 I also wrote that it depends on keepalive flag. It seems, it was a mistake.
 My additional experiments show that there is no distinct threshold of MTU:
 trying the same value many times, I observed loss of acks in some cases,
 and in some did not. So, the MTU boundary is not strict. Well, let it be.
 But the question is what the minimum "reliable" MTU. There are lots of
 situations when data comes rapidly in small packets (say, monitoring logs).
 Is there a danger to lose such connections on a heavily loaded host?
