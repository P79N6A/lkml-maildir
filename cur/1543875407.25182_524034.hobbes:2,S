hm, on a T60, after suspend/resume, i get an e1000 timeout:
e1000: eth0: e1000_watchdog: NIC Link is Up 1000 Mbps Full Duplex, Flow Control: RX/TX
e1000: eth0: e1000_clean_tx_irq: Detected Tx Unit Hang
  Tx Queue             <0>
  TDH                  <ec>
  TDT                  <ec>
  next_to_use          <ec>
  next_to_clean        <82>
buffer_info[next_to_clean]
  time_stamp           <fffcc3db>
  next_to_watch        <82>
  jiffies              <fffd5da0>
  next_to_watch.status <1>
it works fine after that reset. The e1000 driver didnt do this before 
after resume the network was always available immediately. So this 
appears to be a relatively new regression (post-rc3 or so). high-res 
timers was disabled.
