Hello,
I am looking for a brief status describing the current
RAID V solutions available on Linux 2.0.xx and 2.2.xx
We are using DPT SmartRaid V for a system and new
Kernel 2.0.36 RAID tools. With DPT we have no direct
link with the controller. This means in case of troubles
we need to start Window$ and debug the situation using
DPT tools intended for Window$
With Linux Kernel 2.0.36 RAID tools we face the power
failure problem where a cold restart of a test RAID
covering 4 disks with a total surface of 8 GB and
260.000 files takes 65 minutes.
We plan to set up a new RAID V covering 320GB using
36 GB disks.
Some URLs and updated HOWTO as well as experiences about?
Thanks.
