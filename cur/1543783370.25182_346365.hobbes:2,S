It must be my bad english but I wasn't implying that the patch was
reverted in 2.6.13 but that one should apply it (just apply, without -R,
because I didn't attach the original patch but a reversed version of it)
on a clean 2.6.13 tree in order to make it work. :)
However, a different fix (a real fix, not the workaround proposed above)
was discussed on lkml this week and BenH proposed a patch I haven't had
the chance to test yet (see 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/8/31/1
 ).
Stelian.
