No, if it'd jumped to a NULL pointer, we'd see 0 in EIP.

Hm, so first there were some scsi problems and then reiserfs oops?
Actually since the RAM is good, I see no good reason for this to happen.
(actually I see no good reason for valid code before _text, either).
I wonder if 2.4.21 constantly crashes like that for you, then?
