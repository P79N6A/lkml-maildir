Something like that
I've been collecting the data to get the libata driver right, and in
doing so even with the partial data I had came across some chunks of
data that are wrong in the ide/pci driver.
Its not made easier by the fact hpt seem to have taken down their own
drivers for older (now "unsupported" I suspect) chips.
The frequency and chip id data is needed to correctly tune the PLLs and
to identify the right base frequency for timing.
