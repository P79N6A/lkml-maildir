Yes. The grafting really should work pretty well for various things like
this, and at the same time I don't think it's ever going to be a huge 
problem: people may have a couple of graft-points (if you want to drop 
history, you may well have more than one point you need to "cauterize": 
you may not be able to just cut it off at 2.6.0, since there may be merges 
furhter back in history), but I don't think it's going to explode and 
become unwieldly.
I just don't see people having more than a few trees that they might want
to graft together, and while the "drop history" thing might cause more
issues, even that is bounded by the amount of development parallellism, so 
while it probably causes more graft-points than the "join trees" usage, it 
should still be just a small handful of points.
