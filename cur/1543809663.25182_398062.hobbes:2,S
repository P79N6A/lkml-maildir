When I was reading the smpboot code my brain *was* actually in the
"this is a bitmap" mode, but when I then looked at the sysfs code it
for some reason switched to "this wants to just print the number of
siblings as an integer" mode - which was obviously where I went wrong.
If it's being treated as a bitmap when it's created why would that
change when it gets printed - D'OH!
Thank you very much for that hit with the clue stick Andi.
