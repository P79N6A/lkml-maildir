(Looking at the correct patch)
Why do you need that? Your claim that binutils needs that is simply wrong, 
I compiled CVS binutils without problems against bk 2.4.0-t11. In any case, 
glibc-2.1.3 and glibc-2.2 have this stuff in sys/procfs.h, so you should 
use that instead I guess. That's at least what gdb uses.
