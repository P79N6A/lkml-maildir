That's why I added what seems to be needed for s390. For CONFIG_PTSHARE and
CONFIG_PTSHARE_PTE it's just a slightly modified Kconfig file.
For CONFIG_PTSHARE_PMD it involves adding a few more pud_* defines to
asm-generic/4level-fixup.h.
Seems to work with the pmd/pud_clear changes as far as I can tell.
Just tested this out of curiousity :)
Thanks,
Heiko
