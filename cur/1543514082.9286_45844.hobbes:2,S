For those running embedded pci systems the extra 35kb of wasted text
strings is not really nice. Especially if you are going to have to ROM the
image. For some users this could make the difference between kernel too
large for lilo, and one that works.
I thought we were trying to avoid M$-thinking, or is redmond starting to
influence developers, "16kb here, 32kb there, it won't matter".
At the very least this should be a kernel option, 
"legacy /proc/pci (obsolete)". Taking this choice out of users hands is
*bad*.

Why does the *kernel* need access to descriptive text strings of devices
in order to function?
This is purely for user convenience, hence it can be in userspace with
pciutils.
Besides, lspci is 100,000x more verbose and useful than 'cat /proc/pci'.
Is "user habit to type 'cat /proc/pci'" a good enough reason to keep it?
