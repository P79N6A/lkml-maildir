The "spirit" is no different than "intent". Different words that mean the 
exact same thing.

The intent of the GPL, as seen by the FSF, *DOESN'T* *MATTER* *AT* *ALL* when 
the software isn't licensed by the FSF. Or did you forget that part of the 
discussion?

This isn't what you've argued before. The hardware doesn't allow me to run the 
software, so its a designed-in limitation on the freedom of the end-user.

But a PPC binary won't run on an x86 either :)
No, I'm in agreement with you here. But I'm smart enough to not buy something 
that does this to me.

I use it because that is the term used in the GPLv2. And since the GPLv3 (dd4) 
is no longer specific to software "covered work" is the best choice.

Yes. But you are interpreting Linus' intentions using your own preconceived

Exactly. Tivoization doesn't make a damned bit of difference.

They complain to the manufacturer, file a report with a consumer watchdog 
agency and start advising people against buying the device.

Apply the same logic to my above statement and tell me - how much money does 
the company lose ?

It means that I agree that the GPL is about "respecting and defending

I never claimed I did. I was just pointing out that your belief that there is 
only one "spirit" of the license is complete and utter BS.

It isn't, because from my own, and other peoples, viewpoint it *IS*.

So you admit you believe what the FSF says?

If the platform doesn't allow the running of modified binaries, why would the 
modifications matter? Sure, TiVO might like them - hell, they might even pay 
for them - but would anyone else?
So modifications for that "closed execution" platform might suffer, but that 
is the *ONLY* thing that will suffer.

Yes, they are. But only because the law states that they are.

I agreed with *portions* of some of the statements. However, did I actually 
say which facts I found flawed?

I've been looking at this objectively the entire time. That you don't 
understand that is just more proof that you aren't.
