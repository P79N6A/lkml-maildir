In fact, it is. Take a look at the declaration of struct devfs_entry
and you'll see that there is one byte already taken up for the name
string. So adding the length of the string yields storage for len+1
bytes. IOW, space for the NULL-terminator. And right after the call to
kmalloc(), I call:
	memset (new, 0, sizeof *new + namelen);
which zeros everything, including the terminator.
If I missed something as basic as NULL-termination, the thing probably
wouldn't even boot!
