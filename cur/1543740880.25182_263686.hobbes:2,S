That's certainly quite reasonable.

No offense, but I strongly disagree :)
Standardizing the hardware interface lowers the cost of doing an OS 
driver for every chip maker that implements the interface.  The more 
chip makers that implement the interface, the greater the cost savings.
Concrete examples:
* IDE BMDMA interface on PCI.  Practically every ATA chipset in 
production supports this interface.  As a consequence, each individual 
ATA driver mainly involves setting chip-specific timings, and not much else.
* tulip (ethernet MAC).  Its ring and register designs were widely 
imitated across ethernet NICs; as a result, each ethernet driver is 
mainly a "paint by numbers" affair.
* the new AHCI SATA interface, which Intel has on all its new 
motherboards, and SiS soon will as well (as will others, I hope).

Ever-changing hardware and firmware interfaces are a huge pain.  I've 
been writing and maintaining drivers for years... I feel this pain every 
day :)
You want to design a hardware interface that allows you to upgrade and 
enhance your hardware over time, while keeping the changes to the 
hardware<->OS interface itself to a _bare minimum_.  That's why I 
suggested the microcontroller+GPU approach.  The microcontroller's 
firmware can be used to mask the transition between GPU revisions.
Drivers live for many years, even decades, and long after the hardware 
they support has been EOL'd.  It's in everybody's best interests to keep 
the changes to the drivers to a minimum.

Part of open source is open development.  If you develop the hardware 
interface in public, actively soliciting feedback during development, 
you'll wind up with a much better interface.
