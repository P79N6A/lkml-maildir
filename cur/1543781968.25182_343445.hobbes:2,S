I haven't touched my pam config since it was installed a long time ago - it's 
one of those things that is too annoying to fix once broked, so I leave it 
alone at the system defaults ;)
I had logged this as a Fedora bug as I figured the pam_loginuid
detection of the presence of auditing in the kernel is not very robust.  There 
was a patch modified in pam-0.80-6 at the start of August which was to fix 
this on non audit enabled kernels, which works for anything up to and older 
than 2.6.12-rc5-mm1.
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=166422
It was closed 8 mins later, and the suggestion made that I take it to a pam 
development list instead.  Redhat don't seem so interested in fixing things as 
a result of breakage when running an -mm kernel.

Done.  Posted up at

Definitely wasn't enabled.  I still have the .config that I used to build
-rc5-mm1 with and my original -rc6-mm1 and it reads:
CONFIG_SYSCTL=y
# CONFIG_AUDIT is not set
CONFIG_HOTPLUG=y
Thanks for taking a look.
