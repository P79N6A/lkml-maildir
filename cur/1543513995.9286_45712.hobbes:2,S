Hi,
i  have  problems  using  ps/2  mice  on  an  Asus  PIIBF  board  (400BX/ZX
chipset). The keyboard freezes completly, but doing a ping from another box
on this one  awakes things.  Seems like  an irq problem.  I  think i've red
something about a buggy asus bios  here but there weren't any followups any
more. Has someone  a workarround  for this, are  there any  statements from
asus?
	Regards,
	Micha.
