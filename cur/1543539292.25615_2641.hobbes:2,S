Hi,
    I recently upgraded my kernel from 2.2.14-05 (the standard kernel
included with redhat 6.2) to 2.2.16. I now seem to have problems with
the network connection dieing after a few minutes. I'm not sure if its a
tcp problem or a problem with the driver. The system is a cyrix 686 and
the card is Intel EtherExpress Pro/10 . I have attached the config file.
Any help woudl be appreciated, thanks.
