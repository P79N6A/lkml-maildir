Agreed.  I've got one of these beasts running NT Server, dual 433 non o/c,
4x12.7 gig software raid. Before i put the Promise Ultra/33 card in, i was
using the HPT366.  Random lockups every couple weeks.  Stopped using the
HPT366, machine is stable now.  In hindsight, I think the HPT366 was the cause
of the Onstream 50 gig drive that locked up frequently too, before i shipped
that back to Onstream.  One thing that did help on stability was putting a cpu
fan on the chipset.
