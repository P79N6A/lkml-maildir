The suggestion was probably to submit the whole driver as one patch
to akpm for wider testing when it is ready (it still is a bit rough
imho). Unrelated changes make more sense in incremental, isolated
patches as you used to submit before.
I have made some surgery to apply your previous patchset with
former descriptive commit messages, plus your recent codingstyle
changes and a few more.
You'll find it either in branch 'netdev-ipg' at:
git://electric-eye.fr.zoreil.com/home/romieu/linux-2.6.git
or as a serie of patches at:
http://www.fr.zoreil.com/linux/2.6.x/2.6.18-rc4/ip1000
The serie of patches comes straight from the (now old) git tree.
It applies correctly against 2.6.18-git-of-the-day.
The result should not be too far from penberg git + your all-in-one
patch but I have not checked it yet. I'd appreciate if you could
review it.
