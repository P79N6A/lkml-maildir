I avoid this in my own makeit script by mv'ing all that stuff to 
a /lib/modules/version_number.old, ditto for vmlinuz and initrd.  That 
way, if the new one doesn't work, I can choose some other kernel in the 
grub startup, boot it it, then just mv the stuff back, and voila!  
Another reboot and I'm back on the last kernel that worked.

People having trouble with vz bouncing email to me should add the word
'online' between the 'verizon', and the dot which bypasses vz's
stupid bounce rules.  I do use spamassassin too. :-)
