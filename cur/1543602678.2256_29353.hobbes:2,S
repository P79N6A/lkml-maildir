Until the call of interruptible_sleep_on_timeout(), timer interrupts
were processed. Right after the call no more output is made.

I use the function only for a short delay (switch on the device's reset,
wait and switch it off again), so the device even does not generate a
PCI interrupt.
In the time inbetween I have traced the problem: Inside the sleep_on()
functions there is the macro SLEEP_ON_HEAD containing the call
wq_write_lock_irqsave(), where the error happens. This is a macro, too,
which at last expands to
__asm__ __volatile__("pushfl ; popl %0":"=g" (x): /* no input */)
(x ist the variable where the IRQ flags are stored)
I'm not familiar with x86 assembler; is it possible that something can
go wrong here?
bye, Norbert
