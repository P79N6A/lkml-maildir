This is the result of running the Reaim test against the 
2.5.69 and 2.5.69-mm6 kernels. The -mm kernels are a bit
slower, and i'm wondering if i'm missing a tuning knob somewhere..
advice appreciated.
Re-aim is a rework of the AIM suite. (locations below)
Two data points i look at-
1. Maximum jobs per minute  
2. Number of children when Jobs/second/child less than 1.0. 
	(convergence)
Load is the new_dbase load. (AIM7 dbase load with less synch IO)
System is a 4-CPU PIII with 4GB of physical
memory, test used 4 SCSI disks on a qlogicfc adapter. 
Test is run with two different convergence methods, 3 runs each.
Peak load is the average of 3 runs, i pick the best results
regardless of convergence method. 
Kernel                Peak Load
2.5.69 - base         5216.68 Jobs/Minute
2.5.69-mm6(AS)        4963.36 JPM
2.5.69-mm6(deadline)  4966.71 JPM
2.5.69-mm7(AS)        4966.86 JPM
Load when JPS/child < 1.0 (c_ times are total for all children)
Average of six runs
Kernel             Children  JPM       RunTime  c_utime  c_systime
2.5.69 - base      88         5185.88  104.87   376.01   40.28
2.5.69-mm6(AS)     84         4894.73  106.08   374.91   45.54  
2.5.69-mm6(deadln) 84         4858.36  106.90   376.55   46.41
2.5.69-mm7(AS)     84         4853.80  106.95   378.02   46.26
Attempting a second pass of -mm7 caused the hang reported earlier.
