Same here. gettimeofday() is way too slow (dual Opteron box) for the
frequency I need to call it at. HPET is not available. But TSC is doing just
fine. Plus in my case I don't care about sync between CPUs (thread that uses
TSC is running on the isolated CPU) and I have external time source that takes
care of the drift.
So please no trapping of the RDTSC. Making it clear (bold kernel message during
boot :-) that TSC(s) are not in sync or unstable (from GTOD point of view) is of
course perfectly fine.
Thanx
Max
