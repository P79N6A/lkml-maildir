That describes the currently running kernel *as built* - so for instance
booting a RedHat kernel on almost anything will show 3 zillion things
built as modules - including 2.5 zillion things that aren't needed in the
current config (for instance, every single sound card driver may be included).
What is desired is a utility that will do an lspci/lsusb/etc and build up
a .config that matches *the current hardware* (for instance, only including
a module for the one sound card that's actually installed).
