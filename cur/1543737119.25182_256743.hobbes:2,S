I don't know.  The idea was not explained in enough detail for me to
understand if it would be simple enough to administer.  Where can I
find out more?
Does this somehow explain the need for CAP_SYS_RESOURCE when calling
mlockall()?  Comments in capability.h seem to imply that only
CAP_IPC_LOCK is required, which is not true.  I never found any
explicit CAP_SYS_RESOURCE test in mm/mlock.c, though it does check
`rlim[RLIMIT_MEMLOCK].rlim_cur'.
