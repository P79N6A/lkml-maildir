I believe the question was "which shell expects the name in argv[2]
regardless of an options given before the name".
That rules out all the ordinary shell programs.

The standard shell programs all get the name from the first non-option
argument.

I'll be astonished if the change to split the arguments breaks any
script which actually exists, except for the rare and convoluted
possibility: where the interpreter is a C program specially written to
workaround the fact that Linux doesn't split the arguments.
The backslash functionality (\t) may be more of a problem.
