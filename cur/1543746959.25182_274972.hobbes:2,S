Well, at least on s390 some effort was spent on making it work
(see e.g. asm-s390/spinlock.h). I don't really mind removing
that functionality, but I'd prefer still installing some files
into /usr/include/asm/spinlock.h et.al that contain an #error
and a pointer to an explanation, so users can complain to the
right people (i.e. not me ;-).
