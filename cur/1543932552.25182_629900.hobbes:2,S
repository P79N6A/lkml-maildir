Thanks for the review Andrew. I have some more comments, I'll reply to

Not at all ;) It relates to I2C buses being used in various devices
such as TV adapters, which do not have hardware monitoring chips and do
not like being randomly probed for I2C devices as most hardware
monitoring drivers do when you load them.
