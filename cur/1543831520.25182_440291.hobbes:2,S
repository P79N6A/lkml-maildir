Hello,
when suspending machine with hyperthreading, only Freezing cpus appears and then
it loops somewhere. I tried to catch some more info by pressing sysrq-p. Here
are some captures:

It was working just perfect in 2.6.17-rcX-mmXs, but from 2.6.17-mmX times (maybe
X>=3) it doesn't sleep anymore -- I may be lucky sometimes, and it is successful
also in 2.6.17-mm5, but most time everything I get is Freezing and nothing is
frozen but fishes in my fridge.
regards,
