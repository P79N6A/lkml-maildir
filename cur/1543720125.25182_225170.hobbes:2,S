The general rule is to locate drivers under drivers/, even the arch 
specific ones. This allows for easier grepping after users of a
given API etc.
s390 has their own directory.
arm has their own directory under driver/net/ etc.
With respect to patches, a very good approach is to follow same style
as is done for s390.
Smaller logical splitted patches, being sent out after each kernel release.
This allows LKML readers to do peer review of changes to the IDE driver,
without having to step over a lot of unrelated code.
General rule is to make easy for the reader.
