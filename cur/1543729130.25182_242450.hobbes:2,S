They do.
When hdlc is enabled as a module:
CONFIG_HDLC_MODULE is defined
CONFIG_HDLC is not defined
When hdlc is enabled in kernel:
CONFIG_HDLC_MODULE is not defined
CONFIG_HDLC is defined
The HDLC interface in the synclink modules need
to be enabled for either case.
All the conditional compilation is done
on CONFIG_HDLC, and the above fragment
defines CONFIG_HDLC when HDLC is built as a
module.
Is there a better way of handling this?
