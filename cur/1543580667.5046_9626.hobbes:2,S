We're trying to port some code that currently runs on SGI using the IRIX
direct I/O facility.  From searching the web, it appears that a similar
feature either already is or will soon be available under Linux.  Could
anyone fill me in on what the status is?
(I know about mapping block devices to raw devices, but that alone will
not work for the application we're contemplating: we'd like conventional
file-system support as well as unbuffered I/O capability).
Thanks in advance!
