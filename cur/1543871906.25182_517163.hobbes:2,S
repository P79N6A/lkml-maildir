Funny you mention this. We found some noticeable ppc64 regressions when
moving the dcache to standard list macros and had to do this to fix it
up:
static inline void prefetch(const void *x)
{
        if (unlikely(!x))
                return;
        __asm__ __volatile__ ("dcbt 0,%0" : : "r" (x));
}
Urgh :)
