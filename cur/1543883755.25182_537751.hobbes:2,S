I do completely agree with you on this.
The main parts are people doing some sorting and forwarding of an 
incoming bug (currently mostly Andrew) and someone with deeper subsystem 
knowledge looking deeper into a bug (currently often missing).

I had the regressions stored in a plain textfile.
For getting regressions reasonably grouped for my regression emails, I 
used paper, pen and scissors - and this is not a joke.
That really didn't scale when we had 36 regressions.
So some tool is needed if the bug numbers are bigger - no matter whether 
it's Bugzilla or speaking plain SQL to a database, or anything else.

It depends on how you look at bugs.
My ideal was always that reported bugs should be fixed.
If you accept that this is anyway impossible because more bugs get added 
than could get fixed you might not need any tracking at all.

If Andrew forwarded a bug reported in Bugzilla to a developer, and 
the developer doesn't answer, is this Bugzilla's fault? Or in any other 
way worse than a bug report direct to the developer?
