Any program that tries to preserve or detect hard links.  cp, mv (files
a and b are the same file).  tar, cpio, rsync -H, du, etc.
The assumption that inode numbers are unique within a mount point is
one of the reasons that NFS export does not cross mount points by
default.  man exports, look for 'nohide'.
