Hi everybody,
	Thank you for your help!
	I am going to tell you more information.
	my question is about memory fragmentation when I allocate and free a lot of
small memory pieces in a kernel module.
	Can it do a memory fragmentation problem?
	Can I solve it using 'linux/list.h' API?
	I think that is better to allocate a big piece of memory and get the nodes
from this buffer with my own memory management functions; Is this correct?.
Thanks.
