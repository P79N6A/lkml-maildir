   If the coder doesn't lock his data structures, it doesn't matter _what_
   order we execute the list modifications in - different architectures will
   do different thing with inter-CPU memory ordering, and trying to order
   memory accesses on a source level is futile.
However, if the list manipulation had some memory barriers
added to it...
The people doing the lockless reader RCU stuff could benefit from such
an interface.
