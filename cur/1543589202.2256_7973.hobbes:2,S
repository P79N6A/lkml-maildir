Fine with me. Actually in _all_ cases execept cdrom.c it's preceded by
either sync_dev() or fsync_dev(). What do you think about pulling that
into the same function? Actually, that's what I've done in namespace
patch (name being invalidate_dev(), BTW ;-) The only problem I see
here is the argument telling whether we want sync or fsync (or nothing).
OTOH, I seriously suspect that we ought replace all sync_dev() cases
with fsync_dev() anyway... Your opinion?
