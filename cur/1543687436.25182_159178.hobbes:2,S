Thanks a lot that seems to fix also the lock ups :)
acording to the config.help in 2.4 HPT do not support ATAPI devices
and not a long ago there were reports for lock-ups on promise cards
when the drive did suported only UDMA33, so i thought it might be related
i'll check later one the behaviour on "cat /pro/ide/hpt366"
(i broke my install anyway, so i'll have to reinstall, and can do some 
experiments in the mean time )
copied several Gb to LV leaving on soft-raid-5 on the 4 drives,
no problems yet :-)
best,
svetljo
