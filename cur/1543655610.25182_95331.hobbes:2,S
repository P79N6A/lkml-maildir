When I look at atyfb_check_var or aty128fb_check_var, I see that they
will alter the contents of *info->par.  Isn't this a bad thing?  My
understanding was that after calling check_var, you don't necessarily
call set_par next (particularly if check_var returned an error).
Also I notice that atyfb_set_par and aty128fb_set_par don't look at
info->var, they simply set the hardware state based on the contents of
*info->par.
Looking at skeletonfb.c, it seems that this is the wrong behaviour.  I
had fixed the aty128fb.c driver in the linuxppc-2.5 tree.  James, if
you let me know whether the current behaviour is wrong or not, I'll
fix them and send you the patch.
Paul.
