Attached. Upgraded the server to 2.4.26 in the meantime and threw out 
appletalk again since we didn't need it in the end.
A quick test with compiling it as a module produced the same unresolved 
symbols. Unless I missed another config option to set?
I don't need to set CONFIG_DEV_APPLETALK as well, right? Regardless, just 
tried, same effect.
Btw, I think I didn't mention earlier, the kernel is patched with i2c-2.8.3. 
Patch generated with mkpatch from the package and applied.
Thanks!
	Oliver
