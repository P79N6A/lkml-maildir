The following commit should have fixed the problem, at least the oops.
Care to give the current git head a shot?
commit fb4d64e78ceab77cf20f7796f74aa10ebe862032

    [PATCH] pci_iomap_regions() error handling fix
    It appears that the pcim_iomap_regions() function doesn't get the error
    handling right. It BUGs early at boot with a backtrace along the
lines of:
    ahci_init
    pci_register_driver
    driver_register
    [...]
    ahci_init_one
    pcim_iomap_region
    pcim_iounmap
    The following patch allows me to boot. Only the if(mask..) continue;
    part fixes the problem actually, the gotos where changed so that we
    don't try to unmap something we couldn't map anyway.
