Subject: vfat broken in test5-pre4?

I think I've found a bug in test5-pre4's vfat support. Here's what I
did:
1. Created a new vfat filesystem w/ mkfs.msdos
2. cp /dev/null /mnt/testvfat/test.dat
3. Here's a directory:
total 16
drwxrwx---    2 root     root        16384 Jul 24 17:58 ./
drwxr-xr-x    8 root     root          200 Jul 24 17:57 ../
-rwxrwx---    1 root     root            0 Jul 24 17:58 testdat
<===    
What happened to the dot between "test" and "dat"? This is definitely
a kernel issue, with strace output to prove it:
...
===>  open("test.dat", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC|O_LARGEFILE, 0600) = 5 
1767  fstat64(5, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0770, st_size=0, ...}) = 0
...
Furthermore, the fs gets corrupted after this, with fsck complaining
about duplicate names, etc. Sometimes the "testdat" file doesn't even
show up, yet ls -la prints out "File not found" errors and can't stat
it. This bug is intermittent: it only occurs with certain (usually
short) filenames. It does *not* affect any other filesystems, only
vfat.
Is anyone able to reproduce this or has an idea what's going on?
