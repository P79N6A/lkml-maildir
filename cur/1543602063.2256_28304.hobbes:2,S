What is the status of the integration of ftape 4.0x
into kernel 2.4.x?
I am using a Conner 3200 MB Travan 3 Streamer which
does not work properly with ftape 3.04.
I tried to compile ftape4.04a into kernel 2.4.9
using gcc 2.96 and libc-2.2.2 but get tons of errors
(the patch by stephen walter does not work either).
Any advise ?
Thanks
	Wolfgang
