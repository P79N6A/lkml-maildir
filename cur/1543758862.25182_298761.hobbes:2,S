Can you check dmesg for 2.6.11 when booted _without_ i8042.noacpi for
messages from ACPI and i8042 please? Do you see something like following:
> ACPI: PS/2 Keyboard Controller [KBC] at I/O 0x60, 0x66, irq 1
> ACPI: PS/2 Mouse Controller [PS2M] at irq 12
> i8042.c: Can't read CTR while initializing i8042.
