 At this volume I would treat this as a warning but not a critical issue. 
Inter-APIC messages get retransmitted in case of an error, but the
checksum circuit is not sophisticated -- a double-bit error might pass
unnoticed leading to a system unstability under certain conditions.  At
such a low volume of errors double-bit ones are not likely to happen. 
 It's the first report of APIC errors on a P5 system I have seen, so it's
probably not a result of a bad motherboard design.  I'd recommend to check
if the system doesn't get overheated.  You may also be unlucky to have a
faulty board.
