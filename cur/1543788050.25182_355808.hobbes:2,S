I know.

No this should have been a well controlled situation within an ioctl call.
But I guess i should probably transfer this into the user-space, even 
though it means more data transfers to user-space from kernel space. OK, I 
got it.

Yes, yes, I got it. :-)

mmap() is actually what i wanted to do automatically without the need to 
transfer all the necessary data from the kernel to the user app, and then 
let the app do it all on its own. But I see now there is probably no other 
way but to let the app do it all. Especially given that I need to do some 
things within the driver before the mmap() - I guess that should be 
possibble to do from within the fops->mmap(), but I also need to do 
something upon munmap()ping. Where should I place that? There doesn't seem 
to be any function that would be called upon user munmap(). :(

OK, sorry for bothering. I'll try rewritin it somehow.
