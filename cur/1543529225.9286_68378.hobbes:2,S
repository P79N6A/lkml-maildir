it 'freezes' no IRQ at all, the IO-APIC can have any number of outstanding
IRQs. The IO-APIC will not post any further IRQs of that vector, but that
is a welcome thing: most IRQ handlers do a loop over some status register,
so multiple requests can be coalesced. The local-APIC only accepts
higher-priority interrupts while unacked, but this was an intended change:
IRQ handlers should be atomic and must not rely on other IRQs arriving
during the handler. (This APIC handling method is btw. similar to what NT
uses.)
