yes, this does look rather ext2-like ;)
How long ago was the code cloned from ext2?  iirc there have been a
number of fairly subtle bugs fixed in ext2/dir.c over the past year or
three.  If the code was not quite recently cloned then I'd suggest that
you spend a bit of time looking through the ext2 changelogs, see if
there are any bugfixes which needs to be ported.
