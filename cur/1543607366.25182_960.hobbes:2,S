#================ config

CONFIG_PARPORT=m
CONFIG_PARPORT_PC=m
CONFIG_PARPORT_PC_CML1=m
# CONFIG_PARPORT_SERIAL is not set
CONFIG_PARPORT_PC_FIFO=y

CONFIG_PARPORT_1284=y
#================
I did set 1284 mode, and assume you have as well. I don't have super-io
set, since I have an old chipset, perhaps that's an issue as well.
