Sorry, the ITU-R "M" standard specifies 30000/1001 frames (60000/1001
fields) per second, that's close to 30/60 but not the same. Now please
please don't make use run HZ = (60000/1001 * 5) or similar ;-)
BTW it seems to me that power management using C2/C3 states will work
much more efficiently with a lower HZ because the chipset/processor will
be a larger percentage of the time in c2/c3 mode, right?
