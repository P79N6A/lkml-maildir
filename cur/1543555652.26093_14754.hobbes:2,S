Once, after a reboot:
Nov 22 17:25:50 mette kernel: hdf: status error: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
Nov 22 17:25:50 mette kernel: hdf: drive not ready for command
Nov 22 17:25:50 mette kernel: hdf: status timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }
Nov 22 17:25:50 mette kernel: hdf: drive not ready for command
Nov 22 17:25:52 mette kernel: ide2: reset: success
(But I described the situation where the data on disk was correct
and the date in core was not - almost certainly this is not an IDE problem.)
