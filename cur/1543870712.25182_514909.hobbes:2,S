Hi all...
I get this messages on my syslog:
Mar  2 23:33:41 werewolf-wl firmware.sh[4088]: Cannot find  firmware file 'intel-ucode/0f-02-09'
Mar  2 23:33:41 werewolf-wl firmware.sh[4084]: Cannot find  firmware file 'intel-ucode/0f-02-09'
Mar  2 23:33:41 werewolf-wl firmware.sh[4092]: Cannot find  firmware file 'intel-ucode/0f-02-09'
Mar  2 23:33:41 werewolf-wl kernel: IA-32 Microcode Update Driver: v1.14a <tigran@aivazian.fsnet.co.uk>
Mar  2 23:33:41 werewolf-wl firmware.sh[4096]: Cannot find  firmware file 'intel-ucode/0f-02-09'
From what I undestand, the old interface for microcode still works, but
I would like to move to the new one. I suppose I have to put the data
under /lib/firmware/intel-ucode/0f-02-09,  but where can I get the files ?
Do I just copy the file from old microcode_ctl package from Tigran ?
Or is the file in a different format ?
TIA
