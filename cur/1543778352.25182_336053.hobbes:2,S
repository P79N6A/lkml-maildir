OK.

Things _do_ go wonky, but likely only on ppc64 -- all cpus show up in
all nodes' cpumaps in sysfs.  The other architectures which provide
overrides and unconditionally include the generic topology.h define
only macros iirc.  If i386 were to include the generic topology.h it
would have similar issues since it uses functions for some things too.

I've got the changes ready, just need to test them a little more.
Thanks.
