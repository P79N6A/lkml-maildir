Okay..... this is weird.

                                                                           ^^^^^^^^
That is the bad address,

It looks like an offset of 3 from edx.  I got that from decoding:
> Code: .... <00> ba 03 00 00 00 bf a6 ff ff
which is 
   0:   00 ba 03 00 00 00         add    %bh,0x3(%rdx)
However that instruction doesn't appear in ip_fragment.
The code in ip_fragment reads:
  27:   b9 04 00 00 00            mov    $0x4,%ecx
                    ^^
  2c:   ba 03 00 00 00            mov    $0x3,%edx
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
which contains the bytes of the offending instruction.
Note that $0x4 is ICMP_FRAG_NEEDED and $0x3 is ICMP_DEST_UNREACH:
these are args to icmp_send.  So the latter is the correct disassembly
based on the C code.
So somehow the kernel is jumping to a bad address.  I don't know how
that would happening.... maybe a single bit error in memory or a
register???
