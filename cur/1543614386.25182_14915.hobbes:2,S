Merry Christmas everyone!!!
Has anyone been able to boot 2.4.17 successfully on a system
running off a Mylex RAID controllers (AcceleRAID 170/352)?
My system fails to boot after upgrading to 2.4.17. Strangely
the kernel reports about not being to locate a root file system
over NFS. It then prompts for the root file system on the floppy. After 
restoring back to the previous kernel, the machine boots successfully.
This might be a showstopper problem for users running 2.4.17 on
the Mylex RAID controllers.
Jeff
