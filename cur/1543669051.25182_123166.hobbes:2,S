Yep, you are write it's a big hole but it's not a security hole.
It is mistake of abstraction. ls show file in /proc/self/fd as symbolic links and kernel tries to work with it as symbolic links. Because there will be a problem when program can access file from cwd but cannot access from absolute path, also after chroot and after changing cwd. Therefore it just test permissions of the file and don't checks any directories in the path. It works as a program doing smth like that:
cd testdir
open testfile
open /proc/self/fd/3 (in mind: open testfile again)
it was a choice of proceed, and it's a bad choice.
I think that "open("/proc/self/fd/3", O_RDWR)" should forget anything about "testdir/testfile" and should only check permissions for proc/self/fd/3.
using your test program i got
open("testfile", O_RDONLY) = 3
open("/proc/self/fd/3", O_RDWR) = 5
and ls /proc/self/fd:
l-wx------   3 -> /.../testfile
lrwx------   5 -> /.../testfile
my proceed: if fd 3 have permission l-wx------ it cannot be opened for reading anyway only for writing and execution.
