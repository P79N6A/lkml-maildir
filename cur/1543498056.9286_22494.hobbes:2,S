True.
But at least offb (the Open Firmware frame buffer device driver we use for
boards without a real driver) should have a big endian fbcon-cfb8 since OF
provides a big endian frame buffer only. On most other boards we could use the
little endian aperture.
Besides, I think we'll end up with two versions (little and big endian) of all
fbcon-* drivers anyway on some platforms. Imagine an Amiga with APUS (PPC
board) and two graphics cards:
  - a Zorro III board on the motherboard, in big endian mode
  - a Permedia II board on the PCI bus of the APUS, in little endian mode
You can say `doh, {read,write}l() should test for the addresses and behave
different for Zorro and PCI' (either through explicit tests or through (yuck)
function pointers), but you don't really want that overhead for the text
console, do you?
