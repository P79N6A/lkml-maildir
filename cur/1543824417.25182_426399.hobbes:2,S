If the mixer controls changed between those versions, then alsactl will
be unable to completely restore the mixer state.
Otherwise the problem is with your userspace tools.  I think KDE likes
to save/restore mixer settings on its own and its ALSA support is
horribly buggy.
It would help if you determine what app is saving/restoring the mixer
settings.
