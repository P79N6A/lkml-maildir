I understand this change: objects between 4082 and 4095 bytes are 
redzoned and cause order==1 allocations, that's wrong.

Why this change? I've tested my fls(size-1)==fls(size-1-3*4) approach 
and it always returned the right result: No redzoning between 8181 and 
8192 bytes, between 16373 and 16384, etc.
