The only "problem" I can see with this idea is in the potential case
that it takes up all the IO activity, and so there is never enough IO
activity from other progams to trigger the wait mechanism because they
don't get a chance to run.
That could probably be "fixed" by capping the IO, though... (with one
of those oh-so-lovable "magic numbers" or a tunable)
That said, I don't think there are any issues with the code
compensating for its own activity in the "detect activity" mechanism
-- assuming there wasn't a major impact in e.g. maintainability or
something.
As for the burstyness... considering the "no negative impact" stance,
I can understand that. But it seems inefficient, at best...
