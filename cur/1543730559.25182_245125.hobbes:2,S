In case anyone cares, commenting out the sys_sched_setscheduler() call
in stop_machine() allows the kstopmachine threads to run and the cpu
goes offline.  However, there's still something wrong as
__stop_machine_run never returns from wait_for_completion.
Any ideas here?  Zwane and I are kinda stuck using 2.6.8.1-mm2 for cpu
hotplug work until we get this sorted out.
