... and those are what? If you create hardlinks while copying, you may 
have files duplicated instead of hardlinked in the backup. If you unlink 
hardlinks, cp will miss hardlinks too and create two copies of the same 
file (it searches the hash only for files with i_nlink > 1). If you rename 
files, the archive will be completely fscked up (either missing or 
duplicate files).

What is the relevant case where st_ino/st_dev works and samefile(char 
*path1, char *path2) doesn't?
