Its chipset specific. For example setting the latency high on a SIS5598
board trashes your video because it holds off the video fetch from
main memory.
For PC it should be a PCI quirk. Say we pick 64 as before and pci_quirk
overrides min_pci_latency and max_pci_latency ?
Would that work for you too Dave ?
