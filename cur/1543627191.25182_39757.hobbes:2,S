Hi All,
      I have been working on finding a system call that will retrieve the
current file's attributes, especially the file owner and permissions. have
seen VOP_GETATTR()  in OpenBSD, which returns such information in a
structure. Is there anything equivalent to this on the Linux kernel?
       I've been searching through the kernel code for something equivalent
but my paths have lead me nowhere.
Thanks,
Niki
