	To be exact, neither of us are really LISTMASTERS, we
	are mostly POSTMASTERS taking care of entire system
	where the lists are running at.
	Now if you truly want it, we can become nasty, and add
	machinery to censor the lists.  It is not a trivial
	thing to do, and definitely not without controversy.

	The *real* problem at VGER was running Anon-CVS,
	which ate way too many cpu cycles from the MTA.
	(And having everything in single disk which was
	 very much trashing when the activity was high..)

	For me too, and my workstation is not doing exploding, it
	is just getting its feed like all other .FI recipients..
