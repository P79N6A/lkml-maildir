Guess we live in different places then.

Again, be careful mixing hubs and switches, you can get many switches
with a bunch of 10/100 ports and one Gigabit port for resonable prices
these days.
6 PCI slots is pretty much the limit on most motherboards, if you want
more than that it tends to get _really_ expensive.

I think it is, however I happen to be in Switzerland and we get decent
prices on those cards as well.
Anyway this is becoming off-topic for linux-kernel.
