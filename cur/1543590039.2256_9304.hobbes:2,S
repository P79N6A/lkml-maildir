I want to understand why on some boots it's on while on some
boots it is off, that makes no sense.
Before the piece of code you patched, we call ops->create() which is
inet_create in net/ipv4/af_inet.c, there is sets the PMTU discovery
disposition based upon the setting in ipv4_config which should always
have the same setting at the point during boot, every boot.
You need to figure out why it sometimes gets set and sometimes does
not, then we can figure out how to fix it.
