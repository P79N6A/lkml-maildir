I went through quite a number of boards and i had trouble ever getting the
thing to reboot itself. I've just about given up since i don't have direct
access to hardware so i'll probably submit a patch to back out the driver.
I'm willing to spend some time over the week trying one last time with you
before scrapping it though.
