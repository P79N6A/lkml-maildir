Since this is broken down nicely, a line or two about what each patch 
does or doesn't address would be useful. In particular, having just 
gotten a working RSS I'm suspicious of the patch named vm-no-rss-limit 
being desirable ;-)
Nice work, but it would be nice to see what problem a patch addresses to 
check for blowback under some other load.
