no, there was another problem (which i couldnt immediately find because 
lkml.org only indexes part of the threads, i'll research it some more), 
which was some cond_resched() thing in the !PREEMPT_BKL case.

yeah. The latencies are a different problem, and indeed were reported 
against PREEMPT_BKL, and believed to be due to reiser3 and the tty code. 
(reiser3 runs almost all of its code under the BKL)
The !PREEMPT_BKL crash was some simple screwup on my part of getting 
atomicity checks wrong in cond_resched() - and it went unnoticed for a 
long time - or something like that. I'll try to find that discussion.
