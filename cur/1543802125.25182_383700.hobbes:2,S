Works for me with a 3c980-TX.  I can dig out a 905b.
Please send the exact commands which you're using to demonstrate this -
sufficient info for me to get as close as possible to what you're doing.
Have you tried enabling the NMI watchdog?  Enable CONFIG_X86_LOCAL_APIC and
boot with `nmi_watchdog=1' on the command line, make sure that the NMI line
of /proc/interrupts is incrementing.
