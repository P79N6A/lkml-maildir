Don't know...;-)
OK, I think all would be started through "rcxdm" which call "kdm" and "kdm" 
run "startkde" (SuSE 3.1 beta version included).
Wild guess: Could it be "FAST_MALLOC"?
  # Should we really enable FAM support for KDE ?
  export USE_FAM="$KDE_USE_FAM"
  # Should we use the fast malloc function from kdecore ?
  case $KDE_USE_FAST_MALLOC in
    yes|YES|1) KDE_MALLOC=1 ;;
  esac
I'll try without it, but have to rebuild my kernel with SHAREPTE before.
