How about fitting the style (casts, just one line) of the other flags,
so that these added six lines become instead just the one line:
   #define __GFP_EASYRCLM   ((__force gfp_t)0x80000u)  /* easily reclaimed pages */
(Yeah - it was probably me that asked for -more- comments sometime in
the past - consistency is not my strong suit ;).
