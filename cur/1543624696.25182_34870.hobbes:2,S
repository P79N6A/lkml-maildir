Note that "doesn't exist" is actually a _bonus_. It means that no 
controller will answer to it, which causes the IO to time out, which on a 
regular ISA bus will also take the same 1us. Which is what we want.
Real ports with real controllers can be faster - they could, for example,
be fast motherboard PCI ports and be positively decoded and be faster than
1us.
