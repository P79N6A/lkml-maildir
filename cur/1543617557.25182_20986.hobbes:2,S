Then you've got a bug.  Modern implementations that do SMP provide some
way of placing barriers around speculative execution structures to make
sure you don't, say, go out and read some memory location that changes
state in a device because that's an OK speculative action to take.
Can't really comment on x86, as I'm not very good with it, but taking
for example MIPS and Alpha, in addition to the ll-sc ops, there are a
sync and mb instructions, respectively, which provide a method for
assuring that previous operations have become visible in terms of
general machine state before going on.
