Yes it is like tmpfs. E.g. Solaris implements posix shm with tmpfs
like we do with shm fs.
But shm fs is also missing many features like directories, read/write
support for files, etc. So in the current state it is only usable for
shared memory. But it could be extended later. I am not sure if it
really makes sense. We have a very efficient cache and I once used a
RAM disk for /tmp and did not see a performance increase.
