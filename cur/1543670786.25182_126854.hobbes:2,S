well, i have myself reproduced 30+ secs worth of pid-alloc related lockups
on my box, so it's was definitely not a fata morgana, and the
pid-allocation code was definitely quadratic near the PID-space saturation
point.
There might be something else still biting your system, i'd really be
interested in hearing more about it. What workload are you using to
trigger it?
