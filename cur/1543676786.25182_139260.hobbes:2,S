Subject: [PATCH] tmpfs 3/3 little bits
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Remove shmem_nrpages, no use is made of it (even 2.4-ac, though it
counts it, does nothing with it): reintroduce if it becomes useful.
Replace GPL oneliner by the block from 2.4-ac, extend Copyright to
2003, remove two white spaces.
