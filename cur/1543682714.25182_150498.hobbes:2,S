Not for someone as lazy as me.  If you want to know for sure:
- Figure out all possible path leading to that function.
- Figure out all possible path called by that function.
- Sum up all the stack allocated variable size for both.
- Add the architecture-specific function call overhead, multiplied
  by the number of functions on both paths.
Now you have the stack consumption that you were not responsible for,
which depends on the architecture.  Substract that number from the
total stack size, which is also architecture-specific and you know how
much is left.  It is a lot of work and the hard part is finding all
the possible paths.  If you have a good idea how to automate that,
please tell me.  Else, we have to live with rules of thumb.

You end up with all sorts of architecture dependent stuff when
allocating stack.  A long is 4 or 8 bytes, same for pointers, the
amount and size of saved registers differs, the size of the stack
differs, some architectures have a seperate interrupt stack.
If you look closely at the kernel, there is currently no way of
telling whether it contains stack overflows waiting to happen, or not.
We live with lots of hope and the comforting feeling that there were
not many stack overflows in the past.  I wish we had better tools, but
we don't.
