I really understand if you are too busy answering stupid questions from
me. But I still hope someone can answer my one question.
I have six usb-devices: 3com Bluetooth, HP printer, Epson scanner,
Logitech keyboard/mouse, Kodak digital camera and a no-name memory card
reader. My motherboard have six onboard usb-ports.
The problem _only_ occur when I have a ppp-connection through the
ftdi_sio adapter. I tried disconnecting everything except the usb-serial
adapter and the Logitech. Same problem. Without an active
ppp-connection. No problems what-so-ever.
If I use a PS/2 keyboard and mouse, no problems with the rest of the usb
devices, even with a ppp connection.
Can my usb-serial converter be the flaky device, even though it's the
Logitech that is complaining, or can it be the motherboard? Since I
never-ever saw any error messages untill I recently switched my pl2303
against the ftdi_sio.
Best regards,
Stian
