From a usability perspective, an ioctl is no substitute for being able to 
resize a device with "dd".  (Or for that matter, make it sparse.)

I wouldn't say not important: The "database in RAM" people will probably love 
you, at least if they insist on using Oracle.  (Filesystem schmilesystem, 
gimme a raw block device and let me implement my own filesystem from 
userspace...)
But I'm not personally likely to care. :)

I'd be interested in that too.  I've heard it proposed a lot but not actually 
seen anyone bother to implement it yet...
