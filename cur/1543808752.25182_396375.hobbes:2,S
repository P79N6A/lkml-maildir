WTF?  You are depending on that same program to create your device
nodes.  If you don't want to use that program to do it, then use
something else, or use a static device tree, which works like always.
sysfs exports everything that userspace needs to know, if it wants to
create a device node to talk to that specific device.  udev used it to
create your /dev tree, while other programs use it to create temporary
device nodes to do other things to your devices.  Either way, the kernel
doesn't know, or care what you call those device nodes.
