What is really wanted is the -ssize=4096 option to mkfs.xfs.
This does the 4k aligned log IO Christoph is talking about
here, and also sizes a few other XFS ondisk structures such
that there is no I/O to the device that is not 4K aligned.
Neil, I wonder if we could make the message more informative?
Maybe some words about a suboptimal filesystem configuration,
or something to that effect.
cheers.
