It is important to understand _WHY_ a stable kernel is _always_ under feature
freeze.  From his previous posts, I don't believe Colin understands this.  The
reason that a development kernel is often unstable is that there are no 
features going into it.  Stable kernels are stable because there are no new 
features going in.
New features add risk.  Bug fixes decrease risk.  It is untenable to say that 
we should be increasing risk on a stable kernel.  Thus it is untenable to say
that we should be adding features to stable kernels.
