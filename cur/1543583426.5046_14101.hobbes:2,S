Some more info:
I compiled it with support for IANS and without, but I get the same outcome,
only setting E1000_IMS_RXSEQ will cause endless interrupts that cannot be
stopped not with int_disable and not with cli(), so I guess there must be a
bug somewhere, so I activated it on 2.2.x and surprisingly it works ok.
Another thing is that without E1000_IMS_RXSEQ, I can see that the interrupt
handler is being evoked, but the driver does not try to receive or send
although I try pinging in and out of my machine.
