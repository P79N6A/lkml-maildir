And if you want you can use Alexey's ip utility to rename them. Fairly
simple proceedure. For example you know that the Via always comes up on
eth0 and the tulip on eth1. What I do on my firewalls is assign a human
readable name to them before assigning any addresses.
ip link set eth0 name inet0
ip link set eth1 name internal0
Of course this must occur without the cards active - IE: before ifconfig
or ip link set <dev> up.

I have complete configuration and initialization scripts that do all of
this using Alexey's utilitites. They completely replace the init scripts
and allow you to do things like rename the interfaces and add multiple IP
addresses (not Aliases - addresses). They have been written for our
firewall systems and are being published in the Linux Networking &
Security Unleashed book from SAMS due out Jan 2000. The entire firewall
system is GPL'ed and will be released to the web sometime in Nov-Dec 1999.

Meanwhile if you want to do such naming you could use Alexey's IPROUTE2.
