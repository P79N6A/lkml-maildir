/me notes that you dislike both existing interfaces and would prefer a
third.  How likely is it that you will still like the new interface two
years down the road?  How likely is it that everyone else will agree
with you?
In the end, a painful interface is still less painful than a choice of
several incompatible ones.  I used to think different and have burned my
fingers often enough to learn the lesson. :)
