Nice.
Some remarks:
Some functions return -ENOTSUPP on error, which makes "ls -l" complain 
loudly when getxattr() fails. This should be -EOPNOTSUPP.
The module taints the kernel because of MODULE_LICENSE("LGPL").
Since all your copyright statements say it's GPL software, better change 
this to "GPL".
cheers,
Eric
