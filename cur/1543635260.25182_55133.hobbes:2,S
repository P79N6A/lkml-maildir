Hi,
I have just seen this message appear in my kernel log:
Jul  8 20:20:44 twopit kernel: do_wp_page: bogus page at address 40fb8000 (page 0xc2f96990)
Jul  8 20:20:44 twopit kernel: VM: killing process setiathome
I am running Linux-2.4.19-pre9-ac3 on a dual 733 MHz PIII, with 1.25
GB RAM, devfs, ALSA-CVS and lm_sensors 2.6.3, and this is the first
time I have *ever* seen this message. To be fair, I've been suspecting
memory corruption in 2.4.18+ kernels for a long time, and this message
did not produce an oops, but I am *particularly* spooked this time
because this it happened (only once) just *minutes* after my first
reboot since an important BIOS upgrade. Normally, the machine stays up
for about a week before it needs a maintenance reboot.
Everything still fine so far ... see that rubik's cube go...
I have previously run memtest-3.0 over all my RAM and it has checked
out.
Should I worry?
Cheers,
Chris
