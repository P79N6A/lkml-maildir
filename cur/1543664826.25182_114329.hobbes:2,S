    Of course not, it is just a symlink to a proc file ;))) I must
say that it worked OK but really only ext2 filesystems and a CDROM
were mounted, with default options. Don't know if the symlink would
have been worked if special options were used. Now that I remember,
we only use 'special' options for the CDROM (to allow mounting by
normal users) and the devpts (the permissions).
