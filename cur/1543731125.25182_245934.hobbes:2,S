Having a hook in the kernel (in GPLed code) for the explicit purpose of
allowing a binary module is not allowed.  Go read Linus's statements
about this in the archives.

Then talk to Phillips, or Nemosoft.  I didn't rip the driver out of the
kernel, only the hook.  Nemosoft asked that the driver be riped out, and
that's his option.

Great, then use the version I did without the hook.  That's fine with
me.
