I'm looking into optimizing this test. While it probably doesn't affect
the above numbers given the bytes allocated are quite similar, the
benchmark is not reliable, if you want to use it as benchmark you should
apply this patch first to make sure to compare apples to apples (not to
oranges). For example, without those fixes it allocates only 20mbytese
of ram here so it cannot swapout despite I use -p 80, because it
considers only the freeswap and freememory but on any real load all the
free memory will be allocated in cache most of the time.
the bench in short measure how fast we can push stuff to disk (just the
swapout, no the swapins).

For the mmap001 failures, they're due the max_mapped logic (the one that
was supposed to improve the swapout), I break the loop but I don't
consider I didn't scanned all the nr_inactive/vm_scan_ratio. they
triggers only with mmap001 because with mmap001 the lru gets filled by
mapped pages.
thanks for the feedback,
Andrea
