I guess I could do that, but if a distribution picks up remap_pfn_range
in an earlier kernel, that doesn't work either. If it gets back ported
to 2.4 the conditional gets a little more complicated.
Splitting the code base is a pretty harsh solution.
I am also trying to avoid an ugly hack like the following:
  VMA_PARAM_IN_REMAP=`grep remap_page_range
$PATH_LINUX_INCLUDE/linux/mm.h|grep vma`
  if [ -z "$VMA_PARAM_IN_REMAP" ]; then
    export REMAP_PAGE_RANGE_PARAM="4"
  else
    export REMAP_PAGE_RANGE_PARAM="5"
  endif
in a build script which detects if remap_page_range() has 4 or 5 parameters
and then pass an appropriate value into the code using gcc -D. [ugh]
Would it be acceptable to add a symbol like
  #define MM_VM_REMAP_PFN_RANGE
in include/linux/mm.h or is that too much of a hack as well?

I don't doubt the need to remove the old interface. But I see possible
problem areas on > 4 Gbyte machines, such as virt_to_phys defined in
linux/asm-i386/io.h, that are not getting fixed or do I misread the
way that code works.
