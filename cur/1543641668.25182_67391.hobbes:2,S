   I don't really much care how it gets fixed, I could equally well imagine
   having a dummy struct when CONFIG_HIGHMEM isn't set. Whatever makes the 
   dang thing work. There's certainly a good argument that non-broken 
   architectures shouldn't need to bother with kmap() at all..
Or that since the enumeration values are basically identical
on every system that the belong in linux/kmap_types.h :-)
