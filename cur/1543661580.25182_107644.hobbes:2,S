Whether its slower depends on the hardware; on my 128MB Celeron 933
laptop (17MB/s HDD), I can write an image of about 120MB, reboot and get
back up and running in around a minute and a half. That's about the same
as far as I remember, but has (as you say) the advantage of not still
having to get things swapped back in.

It doesn't really matter what kernel is loaded when we start a resume
anyway, does it? Could they not be different versions because one is
going to replace the other anyway?
