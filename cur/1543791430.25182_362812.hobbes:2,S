Oh, I see... I can't prevent them from being cleaned during the DMA
then... Ok, will do that.
Also, what do you suggest as a good threshold to use on the max amount
of memory I can let the X server "pin" that way ? I was thinking it as
equivalent to mlock, thus I could maybe hijack mm->locked_vm & use
RLIMIT_MEMLOCK or is that too gross ?
