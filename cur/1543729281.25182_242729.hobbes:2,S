An unpatched cdrecord does not use root privileges to access devices. It
increases its priority, locks memory and drops privileges before doing
anything else. According to its author, cdrecord is designed for this mode
of operation. I don't know if the same is true for growisofs and other
tools.
suid has no effect on the issue at hand (provided cdrecord has not
been modified), it only serves to increase burning reliability.
