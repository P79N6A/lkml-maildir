Automatically? You mean by having some kind of macro that generates
the string from its parameters or some kind of structure and than use
"file2alias" to generate the alias lines automatically?
I am not sure if that is a good idea, because people really need to
clean up their strings manually before putting them into
MODULE_ALIAS. DMI data blocks usually contain a lot of rubbish. People should
really think twice when writing down those lines.
It's not that difficult to write these strings by hand, they are not
that weird. Also, on systems with this patch applied all you need to
do is run "cat /sys/class/dmi/id/modalias" to get the proper
MODULE_ALIAS string for your respective machine. Then, just replace
all rubbish with "*" and you are done.
If required I can hack up a simple script that generates the data from
dmidecode.

All characters <= 32 and >= 127, and ':'. The latter we use for
separating the DMI fields in the modalias strings, hence we don't want
the DMI data to use that character.
