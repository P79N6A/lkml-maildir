Er, wasn't that SCTP?  If so, that's RFC 3309 and many, many drafts.  You 
might also want to look at DCCP (draft-ietf-dccp-*) and the various 
documents from the IETF's PILC group.  There is also a proposal for a new 
TCP-style protocol with a real differential controller, the name of which I 
can't recall right now.
See also draft-allman-tcp-sack for another proposal for a fix that won't 
break old stacks.  Also draft-ietf-tsvwg-tcp-eifel-alg, 
draft-ietf-tsvwg-tcp-eifel-response and many more.
I can't claim to be a TCP expert, but TCP_RTO_MIN can certainly have a 
different value for IPv6, where I believe millisecond reolution timers are 
required, so 2ms would be correct.
Unfortuntately, TCP is incredibly subtle.  So, the IETF are really 
conservative about even suggesting modifications to it, because a common 
and badly behaved stack can cause major disasters in the 'net.
