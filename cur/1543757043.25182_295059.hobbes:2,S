The keyboard is very much the issue - your typing either goes into
the VT on the primary card - or into the X session.  There is no other way
the computer can know what you mean.  I guess you're going to
run an X session that won't use kbd input at all, given the question you 
ask?
The stock 2.6.x can't do it, but take a look at the ruby patch.
Ruby is really meant for hooking up several keybaords, so you can have one
keboard for the VT's on your first card and another kbd for the X session.
This lets several users work at the same time, using only one pc.
If you don't need the scondary keyboard - don't plug one in.  Ruby can still
give you a dummy VT where no input or output happens, and X can use that VT.
Boot the ruby-patched 2.6.x kernel with the "dumbcon=1" parameter to get one
dummy console, and let X use VT17 which will be that dummy.
