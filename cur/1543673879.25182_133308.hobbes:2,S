Bah. It would work, but it's a hack. We'll get caught in a game similar to 
the leap-frogging initcalls. In fact, we could just get really twisted and 
define various levels of exitcalls. [ Or, do them implicitly with some 
linkser-section-fu by calling the modules' exit functions in the reverse 
order in which they were initialized, but that's another story. ]
I just think that system level devices need to be treated specially in 
every case. They just don't work as normal devices because of the ordering 
issue. We can keep a separate list of them and deal with them explicitly 
after regular devices. It's not that bad of a change, but will take a few 
days, unless someone wants to take a stab at it..
