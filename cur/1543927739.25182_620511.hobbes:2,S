For the legal/email bits: Start at
http://www.linux-foundation.org/en/Technical_Advisory_Board_
(TAB)
For the code you might want start by talking to
Michael Wu <flamingice@sourmilk.net> and Andrea Merello
<andreamrl@tiscali.it> who did the cleanup for the Realtek 8187 device
from Realtek reference code.
Also the wireless maintainer: John Linville (linville@tuxdriver.com)
although I suspect he'll be busy eating turkey right now.
