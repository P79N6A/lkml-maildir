The problematic workloads are much simpler than that: simply a kernel
compile when there's a lot of writeout happening to the same disk.
Truncation of files in /tmp takes a long time because it has to wait for
in-flight writeout.  If we do that synchronous I/O while holding i_sem,
nobody else can get at /tmp.
"When there is a continuous streaming write to the same disk, this patch
reduces the time for `make -j4 bzImage' from 370 seconds to 220."
Yeah, the tweak is not pretty, but that's a significant speedup.
