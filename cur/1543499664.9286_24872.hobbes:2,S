RTFM. Nope, you couldn't. Moreover, mkdir(2) was a separate syscall. Yes,
it didn't create '.' and '..'. That's what mkdir(1) did after calling
mkdir(2).
	Albert, the whole set of v1 manpages is available on the
www.cs.bell-labs.com/~dmr, along with pretty interesting texts on early
history. Could you consider *reading* them?

If the thing doesn't fit well into your idea of the world - you know where
to find NT or VMS if you need them.
