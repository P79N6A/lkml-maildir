Have a look at user-mode Linux (
http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net
).  It 
runs the kernel in userspace, so gprof and gcov can be used on it (although, 
at the moment, neither work on UML because of architectural changes I've made 
since I first made them work - these problems will be fixed in the 
medium-term).
Both gprof and gcov produce very interesting information when run on the 
kernel.
So, while you're gathering up tools and information, gather up UML and start 
playing with it.  And if you feel like it, make gcov work again on it - I 
accept patches :-)
