OK...
            I am using slack with kernel 2.0.3x . My questions are.
            How do i get myself updated to the new kernel.
            I have read the readme file in the  /usr/src/linux directory
which tells me to apply patches starting from the "next available patch".
            Does that mean, if i want to reach kernel 2.3.xx from 2.0.xx do
i need to apply all the patches in between?? if yes, please give me pointers
& websites where i can download them in order.Is kernel.org the best place??
            I am downloading the 2.3.46 kernel right now. Will that be
sufficient if i apply that as a patch.
            Please do reply back to this e-mail.
Regards
Pavan
