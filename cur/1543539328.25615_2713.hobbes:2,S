Subject: [ANNOUNCE] 3Com 3C359 Token Ring Adapter Driver Available

The driver for the 3Com 3C359 Token Ring PCI Velocity XL adapter is now
available.
There are versions for both 2.2.17pre and 2.4.0-test5 and they can be
downloaded from:
http://www.linuxtr.net/download.html
 
These are complete patch files for the respective kernels, I haven't
attached them to this e-mail due to their size (both weigh in at 41k each
gzipped due to the microcode that must be included with the driver.)
If anybody would like me to send them directly to them just let me know.
Thanks
