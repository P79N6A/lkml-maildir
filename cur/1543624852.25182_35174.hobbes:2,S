Search the kernel mailing lists at kernel.org for apic and you will find a number
of them. Of coarse this is all hear say.

I have no experience with BSD.

I see a message very similar but with the text "Broken_Bios". I don't really know
if it is related to the problem or not.
One thing for sure that I can say is that irqs 0,1,2 cannot be directed to or from
any processor on these 6400 boxes. They insist on being stuck to all 4 processors.
This I do beleive is related to the HANGS that I have.
