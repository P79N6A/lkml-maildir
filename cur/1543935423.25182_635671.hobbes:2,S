Do it step-by-step.
git checkout v2.6.15
make oldconfig
git checkout v2.6.16
make oldconfig

I can recommend that you try another distribution then.

What specific modules and which order do you need for the disks?

I do not really have to configure anything on my machine. Then again,
yours might be vastly different. I can seamlessy switch distro and
self-built kernels, with the only extra that I have to call mkinitrd
(on opensuse that works without arguments even) for the self-built one.
>(demanding crap that demands udev to edit their initrds).
mkinitrd should take care of that.
