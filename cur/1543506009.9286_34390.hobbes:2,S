Yep.

Oh.  Out of curiosity, how do you expect to do thousands of reads per
second when you have a thousandth of a second between them? :)
Seriously, you probably want to look at the PC speaker driver patch -
this did some pretty hairy modifications to the timer interrupt stuff
to have it use the RTC instead of the usual PC timer chip, I think.
It seems to have disappeared from its previous home, but
dave@infradead.org was last to be seen with it.

Platforms.  The TSC is an i386 thing, though other architectures often
have similar features.  Either way, it's only really useful for
busy-waiting and accurate timing measurements anyway.

grep the source for CONFIG_M586TSC, or visit www.intel.com.
