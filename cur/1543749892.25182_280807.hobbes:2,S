Subject: FW: [PATCH] AB-BA deadlock between uidhash_lock and tasklist_lock.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/12/22/145

We have uncovered a very difficult to trip AB-BA deadlock between the
uidhash_lock and tasklist_lock.
reparent_to_init() does write_lock_irq(&tasklist_lock) then calls
switch_uid() which calls free_uid() which grabs the uidhash_lock.
Independent of that, we have seen a different cpu call free_uid as a
result of sys_wait4 and, immediately after acquiring the uidhash_lock,
receive a timer interrupt which eventually leads to an attempt to grab
the tasklist_lock.
