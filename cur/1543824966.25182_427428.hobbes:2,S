Well I always thought that 127.0.0.1 is localhost, and _only_ localhost,
and the host's real name would rather be mapped to its IP on the real
NIC. Every interface (including local loopback) has a distinct IP;
hostnames are supposed to be resolved to one of these and need to be
somewhat unique on subnets, unless a fqdn is supplied. So here's what I
got, following that scheme:
127.0.0.1     localhost.localdomain    localhost
192.168.x.y   host.domain.tdl          host
Major catch: it presumes you have at least one NIC actually in use. If
lo is the absolute sole interface, one might map every single hostname
to that one as well. Schizophrenia is fun, solitude is gone for good : )
Larger institutions would prefer dynamic stuff like DHCP and DNS anyway,
but for distros' installers intended for home users this might be a
viable solution - never experienced any strangeness with that one so
far.
Just my .02€, with kind regards
Chris
