Or use --print-libgcc-file-name:
   	`gcc <options> --print-libgcc-file-name`
where <options> are the options normally used to compile code (ie, for example
on machines that optionally do not have a floating point use, adding
-msoft-float would select the libgcc.a that was compiled with -msoft-float).

Other than division, most of the 64 bit support functions are fairly easy to
write.  Obviously, if you do this and gcc 7.0 changes the interface to call
different functions, you are hosed.
