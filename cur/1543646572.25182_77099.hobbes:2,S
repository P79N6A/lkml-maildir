Just had my first experience with this error. Machine was up and running for 
24 days. IDE died in the middle of the night.
I have 2.4.19 without any patches, three ide harddrives, no CD-ROM.
I quite like the data on my machine, so I won't install an 2.4.20-pre on it

Forgot to look at the LED.
System responded to ping, virtual terminals were OK, no login possible.
/var/log/messages contains some NULLs.

Ditto.
