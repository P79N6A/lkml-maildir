Boy, that's complex.  It'd be nicer to have a name:value\n format, like
/proc/meminfo.  But that would really imply one /proc file per mount under
/proc/<pid>/mountinfo/...
If history teaches us anything, it is that we should make this thing
extensible in ways in which we can be confident will not break existing
parsers.
Does this format ensure that?  It's hard to see how.

The patch adds a new concept of an "id" for each vfsmount (correct?). 
Perhaps the semantics of that identifier should be captured in code
comments, probably in pnode.c.  Things like:
- They're always unique
- They are allocated on a first-fit-from-zero basis (correct?)
- They are used for... ?
They are also signed, which seems inappropriate.
The new exported-to-everyone dentry_path() probably could do with a bit
more documentation - it's the sort of thing which people keep on wanting
and using.
How does dentry_path() differ from d_path() and why do we need both and can
we get some sharing/consolidation happening here?
Why do d_path() and dentry_path() have differing conventions for displaying
a deleted file and can we fix that?
This patch adds a lot of code which is, I guess, unused if
CONFIG_PROC_FS=n.  Fixable?
