Subject: 2.4.17 - HIMEM option creates unresolved symbols for FS modules

I have a pentium 4 machine running RedHat 7.2 into which I just install 1GB of RAM.  I compiled the 2.4.17 kernel and modules with the 4GB memory option.  On rebooting the system with the new kernel several error messages where generated.  depmod -e reported unresolved symbols for many file system modules including but not limited to: nfs nfsd loop smbfs and reiserfs.
I re-complied the kernel with only one change, High Memory Support was turned off. The new kernel worked great and I had no unresolved symbols in any of the re-compiled modules.
