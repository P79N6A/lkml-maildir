Yep, this is a longstanding problem. Will look into it and a couple
other things once I get the my current batch of patches running
against -current.
BTW, did ttyso ever ACK your last set of random changes or is it safe
to assume it's unmaintained?

Not sure this is an ideal fix. We might instead have an entropy
low-water mark (say 1/2 pool size), below which /dev/urandom will not
deplete the pool. This way when we have ample entropy, both devices
will behave like TRNGs, with /dev/urandom falling back to PRNG when a
shortage is threatened.
