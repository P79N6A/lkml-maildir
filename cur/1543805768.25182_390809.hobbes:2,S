It looks such a likely candidate, doesn't it.  Unfortunately, Tejun Heo
removed that code around 6 Jan (in [BLOCK] update SCSI to use new
blk_ordered for barriers), so if it is that, then the latest kernels
should now not be leaking.
However, all the avaliable evidence does seem to point to the write
barrier enforcement.  I'll take another look over those code paths.
