The GPL'd driver that broadcom distributes.  The history of tg3.c
is that broadcom's bcm57xx driver drove the hardware correctly but
not linux so it was rewritten from scratch. 
Beyond that you need to talk to Broadcom.  But if the originator
of the bits  distributes them gpl from a redistribution point the
kernel is fine.  
It sounds like you are now looking at the question of are the
huge string of hex characters the preferred form for making
modifications to firmware.  Personally I would be surprised
but those hunks are small enough it could have been written
in machine code.
So I currently have no reason to believe that anything has been
done improperly with that code.
