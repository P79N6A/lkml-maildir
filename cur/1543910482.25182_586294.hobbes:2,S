I think you are missing the fact that there are lots of situations
where users may hit the configured process limit without that being an
indication of a fork bomb (or other) attack.
This means that there will be many systems that will trigger your
warning where there really is no problem. That's a good reason for a)
making the message KERN_INFO and b) let administrators somehow disable
it completely.
Personally I'm wondering if we even want/need this at all.
