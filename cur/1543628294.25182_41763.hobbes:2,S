I agree.
I've told myself that I shouldn't have done "-preX" releases at all in
2.5.x - the "real" numbers have become diluted by them, and I suspect the
-pre's are really just because I got used to making them during the
over-long 2.4.x time.
For development stuff, I think I personally would rather have dailies
together with a higher frequency of "real" releases. But as it is now
(because it isn't automated), the dailies would be a lot of work..
