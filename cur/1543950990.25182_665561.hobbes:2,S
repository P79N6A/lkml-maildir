It's not a warning message, it is an annoying delay that has been added 
to almost -every- local pull, impacting my main kernel workflow.
Further -- as my email demonstrated with examples -- it would repeatedly 
'git gc' on the same repository over and over again, for each 'git pull' 
or 'git rebase' that I did.  That is overly excessive.

Yes, I regularly run both 'git gc' and 'git prune'.
But since (ref original email) I was doing some rebasing, there are 
inevitably changesets left dangling after such an operation.
