The question is where the call to schedule happened. If it was between
the local_save_flags and irq_restore, then I believe the interrupts are
off and the schedule can take place.  But if it was afterwards, then this
is probably the fix since the irqrestore probably didn't restore it.
I guess we need to wait for Chuck to answer this.
