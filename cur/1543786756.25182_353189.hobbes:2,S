The attached patch uses the kernel min() macro, that is optimized has 
single compare by gcc-O2. Andrew, this goes over (hopefully ;) the bits 
you already have in -mm.
PS: It might be possible to move the currently epoll-local EP_MAX_MSTIMEO 
macro, to a MAX_LONG_MSTIMEO (or whatever name you like) somewhere in the 
tree, to be used where needed.
