Linux does not support synchronous metadata, except as a side-effect of
completely synchronous filesystems.  Stephen Tweedie (sct@redhat.com) is
working on journalling extensions to ext2 and the vfs/block device layers,
but I doubt you'll see them before mid-2.3.  They're described in a paper
at 
ftp://ftp.uk.linux.org/pub/linux/sct/fs/jfs/.
Stephen - could some of the API be exported to userspace for use by things
like databases which want similar transaction support?
