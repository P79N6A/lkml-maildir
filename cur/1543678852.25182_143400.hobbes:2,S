http://developer.osdl.org/shemminger/patches/patch-2.5.73-osdl2.bz2
No new content, just refreshing to keep up to date.
The purpose of these patches is to get more testing and exposure on
features that would be relevant to server systems running enterprise
applications like database servers.
Given the stabilty of 2.5, most of these patches are related to 
instrumentation and are most useful to the OSDL performance testing
groups needs.
Never sent out 2.5.73-osdl1 because it didn't boot on the STP
test machines (some old megaraid driver stuff that crept in).
Bug fixes:
o Allow kernel build without hotplug
Existing
o NUMA text replication			(Dave Hansen)
o Kexec 				(Eric Biederman, Andy Pfiffer)
o Linux Trace Toolkit (LTT)             (Karim Yaghmour)
  includes relayfs
o Lockmeter
o Atomic 64 bit i_size access		(Daniel McNeil)
o Pentium Performance Counters		(Mikael Pettersson)
o Kernel Config (ikconfig)		(Randy Dunlap)
o RCU statistics               		(Dipankar Sarma)
o Scheduler tunables            	(Robert Love)
