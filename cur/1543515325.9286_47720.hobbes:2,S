Fortunately, no. Otherwise one would have to recompile all programs
before booting a new kernel.

You are too brief - sufficient for what?
I have contemplated the following change:
Everywhere in the kernel, replace
	#include <linux/foo.h>
by
	#include <kernel/foo.h>
and rename linux/include/linux to linux/include/kernel.
Now create a new directory linux/include/linux, look for the
public interfaces that the outside world should see, and
create files <linux/bar.h> containing these public interfaces,
probably included by <kernel/foo.h>.
Of course this is mainly psychology, but it might help:
Changes to <linux/bar.h> (perhaps other than additions)
are serious things, while changes to <kernel/foo.h> are
routine kernel development.
