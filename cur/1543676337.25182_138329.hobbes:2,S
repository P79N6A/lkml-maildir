I checked with Dave in private email and, like I suspected, this is a
(potential) problem on sparc64 as well.  Let me be try to be even more
clear: on many 64 bit platforms, BLK_BOUNCE_ISA will be bigger than
4GB, so the BUG_ON() will trigger for IDE controllers that can DMA
only to, say, 4GB (and it's probably not even an IDE-only problem, I
think we don't see it on SCSI because our machines have SCSI
controllers that can DMA >4GB).
Manfred, I'm readdressed this mail to you because according to google,
you're the original author of the patch
(
http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/linux/linux-kernel/2002-02/0032.html
).
Like I stated earlier, I think this code simply makes no sense on a
platform with I/O MMU.  Hence my suggestion to deal with this via
dma_supported().
