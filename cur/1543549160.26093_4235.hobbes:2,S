I don't see why you call things "first stage" etc. It's perfectly
straightforward. There are two bits that matter: 
 - buffer uptodate
 - buffer mapped.
And the state is very clear and unambiguous:
	Mapped, Uptodate: regular block
	!Mapped, Uptodate: hole of zeroes
	Mapped, !Uptodate: unread
	!Mapped, !Uptodate: "pending map"
No "several states" at all.
It so happens that we forgot an important part of the "read a buffer"
equation. The "read a buffer" function is NOT just
	static int make_buffer_uptodate(struct buffer_head * bh)
	{
		ll_rw_block(READ, 1, &bh);
	}
but should instead be
	static int make_buffer_uptodate(struct page *page, struct buffer_head * bh)
	{
		if (Page_Uptodate(page)) {
			set_bit(BH_Uptodate, &bh->b_state);
			return;
		}
		ll_rw_block(READ, 1, &bh);
	}
Forget about your "stage 1" and "stage 2" complications. They shouldn't
exist.

The "uptodate !mapped" case is entirely clear: it's a hole. No ifs, no
buts, no nothing.
If a map() failed, that map() will have returned an error, and if
something turns the buffer uptodate that's a BUG.
