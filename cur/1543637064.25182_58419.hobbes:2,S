hmm, you must mean nvidia  - well, their
drivers are not GPL'd, but they did go to
the trouble of writing the best 3D drivers
available for Linux - they seem to get a lot
of heat here despite that. Yes, it would be
better if they were GPL'd - but if I have
a choice between fast, up-to-date nvidia
drivers, or unfinished, poorly performing,
crash-prone, bit-rotted GPL'd drivers, I'd
have to go with what works.
When there's 3D linux support for ATI cards
that can provide performance anywhere
near Nvidia's, I'll be glad to buy ATI cards -
but me tell you, for us 100% Linux shops,
Nvidia is really the only game in town since
3dfx went under!
