Started since when? Since recompiling and booting new kernel and/or
kernel modules or not? Because various panics and oopses often result
from hardware failure. Also, did the kernel crash just once, did it
crash several times at the same or similar address or did it crash
several times on completely different addresses?
For hard lockups, you could enable the NMI watchdog. That would give
even if it otherwise locks up completely. See
Documentation/nmi_watchdog.txt in kernel sources. However that is useful
if you don't suspect hardware (unfortunately almost anything - power
source, memory, CPU, bus controlers... - can cause seemingly random
lockups and oopses).

Absolutely sure the System.map is for the kernel that generated the
oops? Absolutely sure the same modules are loaded?
