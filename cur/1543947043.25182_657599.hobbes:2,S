Not the linker (unless each variable is put in its own section)... the 
compiler could (should!) do it... unfortunately gcc failed to provide a 
way to specify rodata, data and bss sections for a single data item (on 
the assumption that if you specified a section, you already knew were it 
should be going.)
What we really need is a new gcc extension:
__attribute__((sections("data", "rodata", "bss")))
... where gcc stuffs it into the appropriate section depending on where 
it belongs, just as it does with undecorated data items.
