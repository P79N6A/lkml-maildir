Hi,
You said (in particular):

All the details are in Documentation/spinlocks.txt which every honest
individual should study (Three Lessons of Linus). Specifically, if you
have a case where both interrupt and non-interrupt (e.g. ioctl())
code access the same data structures then you should use
spin_lock_irqsave() in the non-interrupt code and spin_lock() in the
interrupt handler as in:
my_ioctl()
{
       spin_lock_irqsave(&lock, flags);
       ...
       spin_unlock_irqrestore(&lock, flags);
}
my_irq_handler()
{
       spin_lock(&lock);
       ...
       spin_unlock(&lock);
}
In UP case, these will be reduced to save_flags(),cli/restore_flags() that
you mentioned.
This was asked recently and Alan Cox explained what to do and I even made
a simple patch to spinlocks.txt to clarify this:
