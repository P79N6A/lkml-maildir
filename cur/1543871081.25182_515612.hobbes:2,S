LogFS is designed for flash media, so it does not have to worry much
about reducing disk seeks.  It is log-structured, which simplifies
compression further.
When writing a block, it basically compresses it and appends it to the
log.  Writes only have to be byte-aligned, so no space is lost for
padding.
The bad news for posix_fallocate() is that even if libc is smart enough
to write random data, mmap() can still cause problems.  If the VM
decides to write a given page twice, the second write compresses better
and the medium has filled up between the two writes, the users will have
fun.
