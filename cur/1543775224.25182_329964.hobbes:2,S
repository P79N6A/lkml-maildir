And the API for the userspace application to do that is?  There's a comment in
patch to drivers/firmware/dell_rbu.c that says:
* contiguous and packetized. Both these methods still require having some
* application to set the CMOS bit indicating the BIOS to update itself 
* after a reboot.
but no hint *which* CMOS bit needs to be tweaked - is the drivers/char/nvram.c
driver sufficient if you know the bit/byte number to set?
