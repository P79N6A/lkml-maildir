Linux has a user API for transactions on nearly every system now
(as part of berkeley db2, part of glibc 2.1.+). Full userspace. See
the txn_* functions in /usr/include/db.h or read the documentation
on www.sleepycat.com. The interface is generic enough that it can
be used for most kinds of transactions, not only db2 table updates.
