Yes.  The only place you are likely to observe the driver
initialization problems are kernels booted with kexec.  But there
are other rare scenarios that can yield challenging boot driver
initialization scenarios.   I know soft booting from windows used
to be one of them.
As for the kdump kernel usually you won't load (or build in) any
drivers you don't intend to use.  If the drivers actually get loaded
even if you aren't using them you could have problems.
