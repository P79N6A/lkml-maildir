Correct.

There are now ~2.5k uses of kzalloc in the kernel.
kzalloc and friends implies that we need to duplicate all allocator 
functions. That was never done for NUMA allocators there was never a 
kzalloc_node f.e..
kzalloc also cannot be used in a parameterized way in a derived allocator 
where you would simply pass on the gfp flags.
__GFP_ZERO support allows all allocators to work in a consistent way. 
There is no need to special case slab zeroing allocation.
kzalloc could be removed.
