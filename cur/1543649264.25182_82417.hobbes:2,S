We've had this debate with a couple of folks before, most notably with
Ingo Molnar. Here was the essence of my reply to Ingo then:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=103272155416405&w=2
Ingo went on to provide us with a to-do list which we've complied with
100%.
Basically, there are plent of day-to-day user needs which LTT fills
perfectly. We don't expect users to recompile their kernel in order
to use a symbolic debugger and I don't see why users should need to
recompile their kernel to:
- solve complex inter-process interactions
- obtain exact measures regarding kernel vs. app time
- understand the exact dynamic interaction between their app, the
kernel and all the other processes running on the system.
- etc.

As I explained at that time to Linus, these are exactly the features we
are looking for in LTT. And since that posting, we've added precisely
those features (as I had promissed Linus, must I add), among many others
requested by folks on the LKML. If there's something we've missed, I'm
all ears.
