Stating that your system is "stable" is not very definitive.   Does 
hwclock work when full Fedora 8 is running without the port80 patch, or 
have you disabled the uses of hwclock in your init and shutdown code?   
Have you set the hwclock setting to use the extremely dangerous 
"-directisa" option - which hides the problem because it avoids the port 
80 i/o?
Try compiling and running the test program port80.c a few times.   If 
your machine doesn't hang, it would be interesting to see the results it 
gives.
The C1E patch alone does not fix the port 80 problem several of us have 
observed.  what does dmidecode say for your motherboard vendor and model?
