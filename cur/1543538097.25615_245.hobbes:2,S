Hello,
I just realized that the kernel's OOPS message does not contain the 
kernel version. It may sound trivial, but I just discovered an Oops 
from about a year ago. Now I have trouble finding out which version 
it was, because the lower-priority messages have gone away already.
So maybe kernel-version, CPU type and gcc version/options could be 
included in a future version.
Or, if not included in the kernel, klogd could try to do it. 
Currently klogd tried to resolve the symbols at least:
Call Trace: [brw_page+789/944] [ext2_bmap+245/640] 
[generic_readpage+115/128] [try_to_read_ahead+40/304] 
[try_to_read_ahead+273/304] [generic_file_read+704/1584] 
[sys_read+204/256] [system_call+85/128]
Regards,
Ulrich
