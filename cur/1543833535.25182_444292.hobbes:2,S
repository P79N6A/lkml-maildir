What you could do is to use "select INPUT_FF_MEMLESS if HID" to make it 
visible that this dependency is actually for select.
This point is a little subtle and I'm not completely happy with it, maybe 
I'm going to split this into two select variations - one which includes 
all the dependencies and one which only uses the config symbol to select.
