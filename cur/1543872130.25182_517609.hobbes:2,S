Most likely kvm doesn't implement the msrs which drive the nmi 
watchdog.  That makes it a kvm bug, not a problem with the nmi 
watchdog.  Emulating it correctly is fairly difficult, though, 
especially if we want to migrate virtual machines between different 
processor models, so I hope this goes in.
