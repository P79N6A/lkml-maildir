We already DO report the information we care about -- the SMP
weighting value -- and thus the code is correct.  The value indicates
how much data is localized to that CPU and therefore how expensive it
is to reschedule a process elsewhere.
Anything that reports anything else is buggy.  This includes things
like adding in the L1 cache in an inclusive cache design, or reporting
the L3 cache when it is a shared cache in the chipset.
