I can use Japanese keyboard.
I DO recompile console-tools with header file in linux-2.5/2.6.
Because of NR_KEYS change, as Ogawa-san said,
in 2.4 NR_KEYS=128, in 2.6 NR_KEYS= 0x200
When recompile, some tools fails compile on linux-2.6,
but 'loadkeys' compiles nicely.
Instantly, user can set new keymap to use a recompiled loadkey command.
BTW, Ogawa-san's patch is needed?
I think this fix should made on user-mode tool 'console-tools'.
As same as module-init-tools, console-tools should detect kernel version
and switch type of interface, doesn't it?
Junkio's patch looks reasonable.
