Others have reported these as well. I do not know what is going on.
Most seem to have worked around the problem by moving the card, either to
a different slot in the same machine or swapping cards with a different
machine. Magically the card then starts working (== the problem doesn't
show).
Have a look at
    
http://www.scyld.com/network/ethercard.html
On that webpage there is an errata for the rhine, 000a/0009 would indicate
a transmit error (Transmit aborted because of excessive collisions). So
you may want to check the network (cable? switch? duplex setting on the
switch vs what is autodetected by the card?)

It's certainly something to test.

On the page mentioned above there is a driver that is updated from the one
in 2.2.14. You may want to try that. You need the via-rhine.c and the
pci-scan.[ch] & kern_compat.h. Detailed instructions can be found there.
Compiling it as a module means that you do not have to replace your kernel
or reboot. Save the old module binary to quickly be able to switch back
in case there is trouble.
For me on a RH system:
% cp via-rhine.o /lib/modules/...
% /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifdown eth0
% rmmod via-rhine
% /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifup eth0
(most of the time when I do this my ssh connections are not lost :)
If you solve this I'm interested in hearing how.
