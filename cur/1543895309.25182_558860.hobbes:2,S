Cynical Economists would argue 'legal requirements' are just changes to
the cost of the various economic options. Sometimes when I look at
Microsoft's approach to various cases it seems they think that way too.

That's a nice definition but one I can see being sort of abusable
depending how you read it. We head ever more into the disposable computer
era where as a vendor putting the code on ROM is cheap and upgrades don't
matter (throw it away get a new one).
I can tell you how to upgrade it ("you can't") yet I as the manufacturer
can issue new units with modified code so I still control it even though
it is meant to be "free"
