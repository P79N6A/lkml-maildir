Hmm. We could use the res->flags for this. But I'm not sure non-PCI 
resources fill those in correctly.
A pure "busy" allocation (ie a driver marker) would generally have just 
the IORESOURCE_BUSY bit set, while a real PCI hardware resource will have 
other bits set (ie the IORESOURCE_IO/MEM bits) and not be marked BUSY.
Maybe just ignoring resources with BUSY set, as they are driver markers 
rather than actual HW resources.
