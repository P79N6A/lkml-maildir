Sounds nice to me, but there's one thing that worries me a bit: Qt. I
know it's a nice toolkit, but I have two problems with it in this case:
1) Many Linux distributions don't install it by default, which means
trouble for the ones we really need around here: The hardware and
software developers. Keep in mind that the ones behind the most
sucessful products are forced to develop for Windoze and MacOS, and many
of them haven't got much Linux experience.
2) The Licence... Ok, QPL is nice, but what about small companies that
want to release applications and plugins for Audiality/Linux, ALSA, or
whatever becomes the next audio standard? This is not a technical or
licence issue, but one of avoiding old FUD getting in our way.
My suggestion: WxWindows or some other multi target toolkit, and compile
2 or 3 versions. Would make it easier for "the Windoze tech guy who's
supposed to take a look at this new Linux development".
Or is it enough just carefully pointing out that we're demonstrating
*Linux*, and not any complete multimedia API/engine or whatever? I'm
afraid we still have to fight old FUD when we're acting outside the
Linux community, so this might be worth considering.

That's the only way to do it. Unless you're happy with using at most 10%
of the possible transfer rate... Disk caching and read-ahead is screwed
up by this kind of operation, so the simple rule is
	buffers_per_second = bytes_per_seconds_and_stream / buffer_size;
	seeks_per_second = number_of_tracks * buffers_per_second;
and the drive is completely *dead* when
	seeks_per_second == average_seek_time
Play some with this, and you'll see that you need quite big buffers even
for the fastest drives...
(...Nemesystech's Gigasampler ( 
http://www.nemesystech.com
 )...)
Use the rule above. Nemesystech do, and that's why Gigasampler 1) works
(well, reliability is another issue...) and 2) requires MASSES of RAM.
Probably obvious: Keep in mind the you must keep all start point buffers
in RAM all the time; the data can't be stored in the streaming buffers.
The starting point buffers should be handled as parts of the loaded
instruments (multitimbrality), while the streaming buffers belong to the
voices (polyphony).

70% on a 7200 rpm EIDE disk is A LOT of tracks...

Oh, I can live with some 100 tracks or so... ;-)
But people who are going to use huge multilayer sampled pianos and that
kind of things probably can't get enough tracks. Step on the pedal, play
a long, big sliding appreggio, and see almost ANY sampler or synth start
cutting notes... 128 voices are standard, and for a really good piano
sound, you need at least two voices per key for crossfading through the
layers to follow the velocity. That's 176 voices for the full scale.
No problem wasting tracks and voices, that is! :-)

If you really expect some real sampler performance, you should probably
at least have a separate disk for the soft sampler anyway, perhaps even
a separate computer. Well, with Windoze, you most likely *have* to do it
that way, but we're still dealing with the same disks and CPUs, so don't
expect great improvements in other areas than latency and reliability.
(And that's by all means good enough, IMO! :-)

PS. Look at the cc line... Time to start a new list, perhaps? :-) Or is
there any Linux multimedia list (not directly related to a project) that
actually has some activity, and is followed by the active hackers? I
guess there will soon be a need for a general Linux high end multimedia
discussion forum. And perhaps a site with an FAQ...
