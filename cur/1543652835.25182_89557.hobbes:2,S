In x86-64 (and I think sparc64) the modules (both data and code) also need
to be within 2GB of the main kernel code. This is done to avoid needing
a GOT for calls between main kernel and modules. In the old module code that
is done with a custom module_map() function. I have not looked yet on how
that could be implemented in the new code.
