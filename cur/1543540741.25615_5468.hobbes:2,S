 Hello,
 I am writing a linux kernel char device driver. I have to access a file in
 kernel driver, i used sys_open, sys_read, .. and i included <linux/fs.h>
 which has all the required declarations. Compilation was successful. But
 when i added this module into kernel, "unresolved symbol: sys_open,
 sys_read" came. Can you please help me in locating this error.
 Thanks in advance,
 Saif.
