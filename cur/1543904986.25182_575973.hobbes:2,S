Hm, does that change anything? The files need to be read at the end (so
they go into the cache) and are delete afterwards (cache gets freed I
guess?).

Here's a before/after memory usage for an updatedb run:
root@atjola:~# free -m
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:          2011       1995         15          0        269        779
-/+ buffers/cache:        946       1064
Swap:         1945          0       1945
root@atjola:~# updatedb
root@atjola:~# free -m
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:          2011       1914         96          0        209        746
-/+ buffers/cache:        958       1052
Swap:         1945          0       1944
81MB more unused RAM afterwards.
If anyone can make use of that, here's a snippet from /proc/$PID/smaps
of updatedb's sort process, when it was at about its peak memory usage
(according to the RSS column in top), which was about 50MB.

sort (GNU coreutils) 5.97
GNU updatedb version 4.2.31

Just to clarify: I'm not complaining either way, neither about not
merging swap prefetch, nor about someone wanting that to be merge. It
was rather the "discussion" that caught my attention... Just in case ;-)
