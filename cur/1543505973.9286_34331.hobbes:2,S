Ummm, no, that's worse and a different kind of race: you'll note that in
the original code I posted, the trigger for the wake up should be
started *after* the add_wait_queue.  With your change, what happens if
someone else had already triggered the interrupt and it does a wake_up
between the add_wait_queue and current->state = TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE?  The
task will then sleep until the wait queue gets another
wake_up_interruptible or a signal arrives for the task, which is wrong.
