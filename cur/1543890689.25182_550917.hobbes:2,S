I do not remember many details, but yes, JFFS2 uses zlib trickily.
Traditionally, zlib is used like this: you have an input buffer, and you have
a large enough out put buffer, you compress whole input buffer to the output
buffer.
JFFS2 needs: it has _big_ input buffer, and _small_ output buffer, and it wants
zlib to compress as much as possible from the input buffer, and make the output
buffer full or nearly full of compressed data.
This is why JFFS2 uses different hacks, but I do not remember details anymore.
Otherwise it could just use cryptoapi instead. In fact, I tried this 2
years ago, but gave up:
