The Packet Engines "Hamachi" has a driver that works 1.2.* through 2.3.*,
but you will encounter the same problem with the newer Hamchi boards as with
the Yellowfin boards: Alcatel bought P-E for their switch technology, and
seems determined to kill off the NIC products.

demonstrating an interest in backwards compatibility or API stability pretty
