FYI...after applying Neil's latest patches for raid got this (not Neil's fault)...I'm not currently using LVM so I disabled it.
Good news is that it all compiled (yeah!!! -- first time in months that I've been able to compile with RAID5)
Other question -- it looks like the 2.5 build now builds modules automagically instead of saying "make modules" ???
Hopefully I'll get chance to test 2.5 soon.
