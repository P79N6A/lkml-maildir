"solving it properly" refers to hardening the leaf node constraint
against circumvention I assume. Suppose there's a script for doing simple
on-line backups using "find". Now explain to the user why he lost his
data due to a backup script geting EACCES on a non-leaf FUSE mount. I
don't think that's acceptable. On the other hand, when the user stored
something _deliberately_ under a mountpoint, circumventing the leaf node
constraint by some trickery then it is clearly his own fault when the data
is lost. Anyway, a leaf node constraint can be hardened against misuse
later on, should it become necessary. Your bind-mount case to circumvent
this restriction is slightly flawed because it requires root interaction.

I thought that's rejected because a process doesn't automatically get the
right namespace after rsh into such a machine? And fixing it by adjusting
the name-space of a process (by whatever means) is not transparent.

See above backup scenario.
Issues (1) and (2) are tied together I'm afraid:
When using a private name-space and thus assuming an unrelated process
needs to do something very special to get that name-space then (2)
would not be needed at all.
On the other hand, Name-space inheritance by setuid processes suddenly
becomes an issue: issue (2) is re-appearing but at another place.
