agreed.

That is a beautiful patch, thank you.
Only one small point: I wonder whether it is correct to use the number 
of CPUs as criterion for this architecture. AFAICS, the Specs allow
having only 4 CPUS, but giving them APIC IDs e.g. 16,17,18,19. In this 
case, physflat32 should be used as well (in particular, the APIC ID 
broadcast and mask must be set to 0xff).

Great,
