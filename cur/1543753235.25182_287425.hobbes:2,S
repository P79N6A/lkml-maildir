I don't think that solves the problem.  B should receive copies (with
shared semantics if called for) of all mountpoints C1,..,Cn that are
children of A if A->A.  This is regardless of whether or not propagation
occurs before or after the attach.
Allowing this is like allowing directory aliasing in the sense that an
aliased directory that is nested within itself opens us to
badness/headaches 8)
I still think the only way to handle this is to disallow vfsmounts in a
p-node to have (grand)parent-child relationships.  This may have to be
extended to the 'owned by' case as well.
