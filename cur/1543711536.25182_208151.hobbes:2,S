Well, I've been told to effectively screw my idea by David Woodhouse,
so may I make the radical suggestion that rm -rf linux/sound would
also fix the problem.  No, didn't think that was acceptable either.
Ok, so, how the fsck do we fix the sound drivers?  How do we mmap()
memory provided by dma_alloc_coherent() into user space portably?
It appears from what David Woodhouse has been going on about, even
providing an architecture dma_coherent_to_page() interface isn't
acceptable.
If we can't answer that question, we might as well remove ALSA and
OSS from the kernel because they are abusing existing kernel
interfaces in ways which can not be solved.
