I think that we can handle bug reports like we handle modifications of code.
Namely, for each subsystem there can be a person (or a team) responsible
for handling bugs, by which I don't mean fixing them, but directing bug reports
at the right developers or subsystem maintainers, following the history of each
bug report etc.  [Of course, these people can choose to use the bugzilla or any
other bug tracking system they want, as long as it works for them.]
The email addresses of these people should be known (and even documented),
so that everyone can notify them if need be and so that it's clear who should
handle given bug reports.
Just an idea. :-)

Rafael
