I proposed something along these lines several months ago, poke around
for the thread.  While I agree with the patch, because it will save me a
few lines of code here and there, an idea that came out of the previous
discussion is also worth considering -- zeroing pages during system idle
time, and then handing those out from kzalloc() (or
kmalloc(GFP_ZERO|GFP_xxx) or whatever)
