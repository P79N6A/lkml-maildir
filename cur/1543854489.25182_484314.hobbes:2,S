Yes. I did not mean to suggest that vfork() should go away or that  
shells that make use of it go away. It is just that making fork()  
work has a lot of value. vfork() would always be the optimal thing to  
use, but sometimes you need the power of a real fork(). Greater  
compatibility with normal Linux is of greater value than adding more  
funky special-purpose system calls.

Yes, but some of those 10% cases can be a real pain. Also if you are  
supporting users that just want some app to run, having fewer porting  
barriers is a real help. Often the expense of fork() is only a  
startup thing anyway and not a factor in the normal steady-state  
operation of a system.
