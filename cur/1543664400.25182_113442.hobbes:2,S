For the kind of atomicity you need there probably are two
steps:
1) Quiesce the system - get to a point of consistency (when you
   can take a resumable snapshot)
2) Perform an atomic copy / snapshot
Step (1) would be different for swsusp and crash dump (not
intended to be common ). But for Step (2), do you think
what you need/do is complicated by crashed system requirements ?
