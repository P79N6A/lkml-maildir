That's a joke, right?

        ^^^^^^^^^^^
Of course long would need to be always emulated. Your patch
shows exactly why packet based protocols for this are a bad
idea. The problem is that people will get it wrong, and then
it's nearly impossible to fix for a socket based protocol
because read/write cannot be easily hooked
(with ipsec we have exactly this problem already)
ioctls at least can be fixed up. Please keep using them.

And I don't even want to know what's in there.
Andrew, please don't apply this broken patch.
