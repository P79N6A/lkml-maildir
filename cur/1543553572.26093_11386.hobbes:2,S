I'm working a project a work that is using Linux to run some very
math-intensive calculations.   One of the things we do is use the 1-minute
loadavg to determine how busy the machine is and can we fire off another
program to do more calculations.    However, there's a problem with that.
Because it's a 1 minute load average, there's quite a bit of lag time from
when 1 program finishes until the loadavg goes down below a threshold for
our control mechanism to fire off another program.
Let me give an example (all on a 1-cpu PC)
HH:MM:SS
00:00:00    		fire off 4 programs 
00:01:00		loadavg goes up to 4
00:01:30		3 of the 4 programs finish loadavg still at 4
00:02:20		load avg goes down to 1, below our threshold
00:02:21		we fire off 3 more programs.
We'd like to reduce that almost 50 second lag time.  Is it possible, in
user-space, to duplicate the loadavg calculation period, say to a 15
second load average, using the information in /proc?
The other option we looked at, besides using loadavg, was using idle pct%,
but if I read the source for top right, involves reading the entire
process table to calculate clock ticks used and then figuring out how many
weren't used.
Ideas, opinions welcome.  Yes, I read the list, so either respond direct
to me, or to the list.
