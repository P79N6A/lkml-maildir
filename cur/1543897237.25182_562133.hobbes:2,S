Thanks, and thanks for the review.
The ifdef is needed since for CONFIG_PCMCIA=n builds, the bus notifier
isn't available. I wanted to do the bus notifier registration explicitly
before the of_platform bus probe to avoid later surprises due to reordered
initcalls in case it was split up in it's own initcall.
I could add the code under ifdef as well, but it didn't seem too
critical. Once the second major board comes along I'll probably move it
out to a per-board file, there's no real need for it just yet.
