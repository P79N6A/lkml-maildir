I would put them on the touchpad device. This way you create a regular
looking touchpad and a regular looking tablet, and the user experience
will probably be best.
If you report them both, the GUI will get doubled click events (either
through /dev/input/mice or through the event X drivers), which can
result in doubleclicks where there were none when the click event is
very short.
So reporting on both is a bad idea.

No big deal, they're informative only. However, they're defined as the
expected min/max of what the device will report, so updating them when
you get the actual hardware running makes sense.

I would expect the sample rate to be somewhat limited by the fact that
the packets are very large and the serial communication will not be able
to keep up.

Why OLPC twice? Weren't you planning to say ALPS OLPC GlideSensor?
