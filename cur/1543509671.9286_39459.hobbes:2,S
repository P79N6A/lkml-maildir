Put your driver into the kernel. I'd suggest an interface similar
to the current soundcard interface, plus ioctl's to handle
phone line specifics, like hangup etc.
The realtime guarantees should be ok when using what the kernel
already provides (mlock, sched_setscheduler), as long as it
can control when exactly a waveform gets transmitted. It
can do this by sending the right amount of zero samples
to the soundcard aka modem :)
