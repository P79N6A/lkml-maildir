First of all, thanks for the quick response.

I'm sorry. I'm not familar with those applications to get any useful 
information out of them. Any quick information on what i should be doing 
with it would be appreciated.

I'm already keeping the config as clean and minimal as i can imagine.
Anyway... I recompiled the kernel (2.6.22.2 now) with pure libata, 
CONFIG_HZ to 1000 (instead of 250). No effect yet.

I'm using the default niceness which should be 10 no? I'm not re-nicing 
X if that was the question.

Well the system is low on memory (312M) but that was the last thing i 
would've been looking for since it somehow got the win32 gui and some 
games to render and work properly on it.

This shows two interesting lines:
   56.5% ( 21.6)       <interrupt> : extra timer interrupt
   11.0% (  4.2)       <interrupt> : libata

It's a pentium-3.
   model name      : Pentium III (Coppermine)
   stepping        : 10
   cpu MHz         : 1097.269

When am I supposed to check this? During idle it's like the following:
   state count:             8
   active state:            T0
   states:
      *T0:                  00%
       T1:                  12%
       T2:                  25%
       T3:                  37%
       T4:                  50%
       T5:                  62%
       T6:                  75%
       T7:                  87%
Any additional comments on this? :)
Thanks a lot.
