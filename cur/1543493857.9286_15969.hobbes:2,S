I'm in desperate need of help, I've got a strange problem
System setup:
 - Noname system, P-II 233
 - 256 MB RAM
 - Two AHA-2940UW - two 4GB disks per interface
 - One D-Link DFE-500TX (tulip) running at 100FD
 - Kernel: 2.2.6-ac1 and 2.2.4-ac1 both
          (ac patches needed for large file-array)
 - Tasks:
  + Squid (2.2.STABLE2) serving 1 mil. requests / day
    as a transparent proxy with the help of our routers.
Problem:
 - Thursday, friday and today (monday) the network card just
   stopped shuffling packets like it was physically unplugged.
 - No errormessages too be found anywhere, nothing seems to bee
   wrong anywhere.
 - After warm or cold boot everything works like a charm
   until the next day.
Theory:
 - About 14 days ago we changed from 10 to 100FD (if so,
   why now and not earlier?)
 - Too many connections (how is this possible, we only
   run 100FD at the local net, all others run T2/E2)
 - Something or someone is trashing the server (unprobable
   since the router disalows this and loggs anything else).
