OK, good.

Ask people like Rik and Andrea about reasonable upper limits. Make it
at least a day, IMO. There's probably no reason it can't effectively
be infinite. The kernel shouldn't be enforcing policy in this area.
Memory pressure would force disc writes eventually anyway.
Hack 2.4.0-test8 and test it. Then submit a to Linus and Cc: the
kernel list.
