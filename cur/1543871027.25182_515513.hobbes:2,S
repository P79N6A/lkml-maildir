good. Could you apply the patch below, enable CONFIG_PM_DEBUG and 
CONFIG_PM_TRACE and CONFIG_DISABLE_CONSOLE_SUSPEND, boot into the new 
kernel and do:
	echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/acpi_simulate_suspend_to_ram
	echo mem > /sys/power/state
and if the system still works after this point, could you send us the 
resulting dmesg? Or if it crashes, hopefully the crash should be right 
on the screen - how does it look like?
the above sequence should generate a 'fake' suspend-to-ram: it will 
execute the overwhelming majority of code that is done during 
suspend/resume, but without actually suspending the box. Hopefully this 
still triggers the bug and if it triggers, the system produces some 
useful output.

Subject: [patch] suspend debugging: simulate suspend-to-RAM
From: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
most resume bugs are due to the kernel hanging or crashing while trying 
to resume a specific device. It is extremely hard to debug such hangs 
because often when the hang happens there's no console available yet.
Make debugging such bugs easier by offering a resume mode that does not 
actually call into the BIOS to turn off the machine. This, in 
combination with earlyprintk=serial,ttyS0,115200,keep , 
CONFIG_PM_DEBUG=y, CONFIG_DISABLE_CONSOLE_SUSPEND=y and 
/sys/power/filter enables me to have a fully functional serial console 
during the full suspend/resume cycle.
I debugged two suspend bugs in the -rt kernel this way already, so it's 
pretty useful.
