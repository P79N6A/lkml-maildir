I guess that is the limitation of taskstats. One multicast socket for
every listeners.

Well, for every task exists, two sets of  data (of struct taskstats) would
be sent from kernel: one is the stats for the pid, the other is the
up-to-current stats for the thread (tgid).
Strictly speakly,  the second set of data is not per-task stats. For
accounting
subsystems that do not use thread as aggregation, 50% of the data from
the kernel is useless. The option to not sending thread data is very
important.
Of course we are betting a customer site does not run two different
application on the same system.

Probably not until some time next week. But as i point out, 50% of
traffic is
not useful to CSA.
