Like apache and linux? :-)

By the same logic we could throw away Nagle and SWS avoidance! Whatever
happened to "be conservative in what you send" (i.e. acks, in this
case)?
Frankly, I see no reason for acking PSH segments immediately. What's the
rationale for doing so? Looks like a hack to me...
I don't mean to be a pest, but it would be nice to get some technical
grounds for this behavour, since you're obviously convinced that there
are some. Please?

Oh, no. I'm not going to be dragged into that discussion! :) [Do we have
such workarounds for PMTUD detection, I wonder...]
