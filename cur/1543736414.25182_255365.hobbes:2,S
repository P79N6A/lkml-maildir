Hmm, what happens here if that vector was queued just before the local irq 
disable in spin_lock_irqsave(idesc->lock...) ? Then when we unlock we'll 
call do_IRQ to handle the irq associated with that vector. I haven't seen 
the usage but it appears that iosapic_unregister_intr requires some 
serialisation.
Thanks,
