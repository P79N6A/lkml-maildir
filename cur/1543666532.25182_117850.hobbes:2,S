By 'killing apm/acpi', I meant that the pm callback in the source
part of the kernel module call a function, certainly for saving/restoring
the state of the device, in the binary part.
But this function is not present in the binary part of the driver.
Actually, that was the case with 'older' release of the driver, but
seems to be reintroduced in the lastest one.
