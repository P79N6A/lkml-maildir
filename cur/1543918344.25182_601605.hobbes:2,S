The slab for which you are trying to set the kmem_cache_node pointer to 
NULL needs to be shrunk.

Hmmm.. Ok for cpu hotplug you could simply disregard the per cpu 
structure if the per cpu slab was flushed first.
However, the per node structure may hold slabs with no objects even after 
all objects were removed on a node. These need to be flushed by calling
kmem_cache_shrink() on the slab cache.
On the other hand: If you can guarantee that they will not be used and 
that no objects are in them and that you can recover the pages used in 
different ways then zapping the per node pointer like that is okay.
