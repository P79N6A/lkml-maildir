I don't think any of the files mentioned should be included by libc5
programs.  That said, I've sent Alan a patch that corrects the underlying
cause of the program: that kernel include files will #undef NULL and
redefine it to be ((void *)0), which causes other compile problems with
libc5 c++ programs.
