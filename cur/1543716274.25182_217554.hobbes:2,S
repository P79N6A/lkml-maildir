Guillaume,
As mentioned in my response to Christoph, keeping process aggregation 
outside the kernel (or as a module that sits atop process-centric 
patches) will work only for statistics gathering and coarse-grain 
control.
CKRM's crbce controller (will be put up on 
http://ckrm.sf.net
 within a 
day...) uses relayfs to send per-process data to a privileged user 
program (will also be included) that can use the data as it pleases, 
including doing aggregation.
We think a class-aware kernel is the right way to go and it can be 
done with sufficiently low impact that one doesn't have to 
unnecessarily limit the flexibility of users in defining process 
groups (=classes) or the time periods over which shares can be enforced.
