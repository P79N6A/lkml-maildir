It works in kernel.

The easy fix is to just export bdget.  An alternate way would be to
keep an internal table of 'pinned' devices and check it at open time
to see if it has been protected from invalidate_buffers() previously
or not.  I'll see if I can do that instead of exporting yet another
symbol.  (exporting bdget/bdput looks reasonable though)
