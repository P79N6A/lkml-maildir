I'd prefer to not apply any of this for now - there are plenty of slab
patches queued already and now is not the time to be churning things with
cleanups.  If you have actual functional improvements or bugfixes then
please separate those out and send.  Otherwise, please save this lot for a
few weeks hence when the current batch of stuff is merged up, thanks.
