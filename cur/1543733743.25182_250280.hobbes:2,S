This is the required behavior for "hard" NFS mounts.  NFS doesn't
deal with servers that drop off-line very well.
Perhaps you should use the "soft" and/or the "timeo=N" value.  A
"soft" mount will not cause your client to hang if the server goes
away.  Unfortunately, this also has implications for application
program's ideas about file integrity, but there you go.
HTH.
