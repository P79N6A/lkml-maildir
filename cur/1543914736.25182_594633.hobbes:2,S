AFAICS, Steven raised the same thoughts what i had.

I am not saying that userspace is bad. In fact i am all for userspace,
_if_ there is much of a complication. For example we have had largely
complex devices. You might like to read this thread a while back.
This was the reason why we started up libdvbapi/mti (For those who don't
know what it is, libdvbapi/mti is a userspace approach for having device
support in userspace with complicated tuning algorithms with a lot of
calculations)

For that demodulator and a successor for the same, i had finally moved
the same to in kernel with a lot of trouble. Maybe it is not as precise
as it should have been.
But what i mean is that we should use such approaches if there needs to
be a heavy valid reason and if there are many more devices going that
way, we should definitely move to userspace. Maybe the userspace idea is
a bit still immature.
That said, i don't see any such complexities with the XC3028
