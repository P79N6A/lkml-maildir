*NO*
The IDE code is the experimental code in 2.4-ac. It is _NOT_ the IDE
code in 2.4 and its a lot less tested. I don't think it has any
corruption bugs but it is most definitely not the base 2.4 code and has
plenty of non corruption bugs (PCMCIA hang, taskfile write hang, irq
blocking performance problems)
I use the 2.4-ac version of that code for day to day work. Thats about
as good a guarantee as I can give.
