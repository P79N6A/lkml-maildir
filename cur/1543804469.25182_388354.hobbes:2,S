David,
Some readers of linux kernel sources are blind.
They use a kind of terminal that 'displays' a single line of 80 'characters' 
(or even 40) called a 'Braille Display'
This kind of terminal is very expensive, and I think the 80 column one is the 
most you can get (price : about 7000$).
I am ok to be a litle bit upset by this 80 limitation that looks odd on my 
1000$ 24" display, but reminds me the fact that some human people are different.
So please don't count me as part of your _everyone_.
Thank you
Eric
