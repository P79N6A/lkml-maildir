ppc used to do a whole lot more than that, so I don't think that counts as 
a valid example.
tick_length is overwritten at every timer and modifying it would have 
barely any effect compared to other values which are already exported.

It depends on the architecture, but it's effects regularly executed code 
and every byte counts.
