How do you define reference? While you could do locked mem++ you can't
do locked mem *= 2 (or any other non trivial operation that doesn't
direct map to an memory operand x86 instruction which allows lock
prefixes)
IMHO the "barrier model" used by Linux and implemented by gcc is much
more useful for multithreaded programming, and MMIO needs other
mechanisms anyways.
I wish the C standard would adopt barriers.
