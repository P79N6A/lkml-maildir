Hi guys.
Back on board after the big shift :)

I'm not sure about suspend to ram either, but I can confirm the rest:
* Hotplugging handlers should manage the state of secondary cpus, really 
disabling NMIs on unplug and only enabling NMIs if the boot processor has 
them enabled (assuming consistent behaviour across cpus is desired). At a 
hotplug event, both the hardware state and values of variables may not match 
the state at the end of a previous hotplug event (we may have powered off, or 
may have switched from a boot kernel to a suspended-to-disk one), so even if 
you know the hotplug event is synthesised, you may still need to treat it as 
uninitialised.
* Driver suspend and resume calls should only handle cpu0, and should not 
touch other processors. The same semantics regarding hardware state and 
values of variables apply here.
If you _really_ need to store in a variable what the hardware state was at the 
last suspend call, it is possible to use _nosave variables, but this isn't 
done or recommended at the moment. (I think it's a good idea, but that's just 
my opinion). The value of a _nosave variable will persist across the atomic 
restore of a suspend to disk kernel context, and since a drivers_suspend call 
is made before doing the atomic restore, you'll never get uninitialised 
values. I'm not sure what it would be helpful for, but there may be a case.
Hope this helps.
Regards,
Nigel
