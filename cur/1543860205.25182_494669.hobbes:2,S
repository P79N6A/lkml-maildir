I am really bad with names :(  I tried using the _wq suffixes earlier and
that seemed confusing to some, but if no one else objects I'm happy to use
that. I thought aio_lock_page() might be misleading because it is
synchronous if a regular wait queue entry is passed in, but again it may not
be too bad.
What's your preference ? Does anything more intuitive come to mind ?
