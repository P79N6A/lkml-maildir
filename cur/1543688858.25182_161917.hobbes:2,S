The only x86 which will show the user non cache coherent behaviour (and
then only in a really weird situation) is SMP Pentium Pro due to the
store fence errata.
The Winchip is non SMP so you won't see CPU<->CPU store ordering changes
although I guess mmap of mmio space might show you stuff if you really
tried hard
The Geode has bus level magic so its out of order but if you ask then
you get the right answer (kind of the zen question about falling trees
implemented in silicon).
