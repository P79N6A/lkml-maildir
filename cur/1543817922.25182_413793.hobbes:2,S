It is passed from one kernel to another, and it is memorized when you load
the crash dump kernel.  If your memory layout changes you need to reload
the crash dump kernel from user space with the appropriate hotplug script.  
Unless this happens often it shouldn't be a problem. 
And yes this does leave a small race during which kexec on panic won't
work.
