As I mentioned before I have a big patchset reworking this area, so please
wait a week or two for me two finish it instead of creating lots of rejects.

Sure, but that doesn't matter here.  Exports are per-vfsmount, and
each export has the vfsmount stored in it.  So we know which of the
vfsmount we want before we even resolve the dentry.  And yes, if
I have /export/foo mounted with option but /foo now I want those
options to apply to the nfs export.  Note that we actually have another
little bug in this area currently:  if you export two different
patch that have the same underlying filesystems they actually do get
the same file handle unless using fsid=.  We probably need to put
a check into svc_export_parse so that we don't export the same
device twice without using fsid=.
