In case your interested, I tried your last patch 
(
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/4/7/308
)
on top of 2.6.12-rc2-mm2 on my Radeon Mobility M6 LY.
It works great. Switching was at least one second long with plain mm2.
Now it's almost immediat as in Linus' kernel. No more dirty colors
during the switch from X to fbcon. Not annoying at all, here.
Thanks,
Brice
