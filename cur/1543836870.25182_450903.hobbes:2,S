Hmm, it is common pratice to have the path of the source file in the
comment. If we decide to remove all these path from the comments, this
would be a perfect jobs for the kernel janitors. For now I want to keep
things consistent with the majority of the files in arch/s390.
One thing in favor of having the path in the comment: if you print the
file or copy it somewhere you still know where it came from. On the
other hand who prints files from the linux source tree ?
