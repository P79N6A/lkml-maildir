so are you saying that other 'correct' OS's have patches issued every time 
a leap second is declared so that they have an in-kernel table of them to 
use to calculate the correct time?
what about systems that have hit end of life? what about systems that 
users don't want to have to reboot to install a new kernel for a 1 second 
shift (which NTP will take care of as far as they are concerned anyway)
when the daylight savings time definitions change all the vendors had to 
issue patches, I saw those. I didn't see any patches for the leap second, 
so how do these other systems deal with it?
