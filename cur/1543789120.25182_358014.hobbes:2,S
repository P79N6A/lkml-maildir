Please search the archives for the reasons why.  In short:
	- It had unfixable bugs.
	- It was unmaintained for many years.
	- It has been marked OBSOLETE for about 1 1/2 years
	- It has been documented that it would be removed for over a
	  year.
	- It puts naming policy into the kernel, where it is not needed.
	- It is not LSB compliant.
	- there are numerous userspace solutions that do the same thing,
	  in much better ways.
thanks,
