Oh wait, the on_one_cpu() patch proposes on UP:
+static inline int on_one_cpu(int cpu, void (*func)(void *info), void *info,
+			     int retry, int wait)
+{
/* this needs a if (cpu == 0) check here, IMO */
+	local_irq_disable();
+	func(info);
+	local_irq_enable();
+	return 0;
/* else WARN and return -EINVAL; */
+}
which is broken without the suggested additions, IMHO
(this is what got me into this in the first place). There
_is_ a difference between on_each_cpu() and the
smp_call_function* semantics (as discussed on the other
thread -- gargh! my mistake for opening this discussion up
on so many threads), and in its current form on_one_cpu()
has quite confused semantics, trying to mix the two. I guess
on_one_cpu() would be better off simply being just an
atomic wrapper over smp_processor_id() and
smp_call_function_single() (which is the *real* issue that
needs solving in the first place), and do it well.
