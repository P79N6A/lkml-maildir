OK, when I switched the parameter processing to the new technique I missed
the fact that it requires specifying prefix (module name + '.') when the
module is compiled directly into the kernel. Therefore in the lastest -bk
you have to pass "psmouse.psmouse_noext=1" to the kernel for it to be.
recognized.
Since we already have an unique prefix (psmouse) for all parameters and
changing parameter names at this time is not desirable (IMHO) I propose
the patch below to restore the old behavior.
