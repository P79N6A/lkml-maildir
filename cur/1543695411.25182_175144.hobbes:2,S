Subject: [RFC][PATCH] must fix lists
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

OK, I have incorporated comments. If everyone could try to keep your entries
on the list up to date it would be nice. It might give you a bit more
bargaining power to get things in.
I'll continue to try to keep things together until people get sick of it,
but its not easy working out exactly where people are up to with most 
things.
Everyone has to work extra hard to clear this list for 2.6.0, but that
doesn't look realistic. Hopefully it can be done before 2.7 branches. I
guess the security fixes audit is the most important thing for 2.6.0.
