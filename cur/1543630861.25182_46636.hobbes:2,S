Guess what... after the first time you do it the newfangled way the
new commands will be in .bash_history too!

If you do it _that_ often, then you'll get it the same automation in no
time with any strange new commands. Or find a way to integrate them with
your cron job that downloads patches (Heck... I update gcc from CVS
nightly, build it and run its testsuite from cron). But just compiling any
random kernel that shows up is not enough...
