The PIDENTIFY_DEVICE command is sent to the drive,
and one of the data fields returned is "drive maxspeed"
which in this case the drive sets to "14 x 176KB/sec"
(176KB/sec = 1X or "original" CD speed).
Linux just displays what the drive told it.

Note that the "maxspeed" only applies to a small zone on the outer
tracks,
which is why cdroms are now advertised as "up to 32x" rather than "32x".
The *average* over the whole drive will be much lower than the maxspeed.
