To any Sparc guru,
This question relates to the effect of instruction alignment on a Sparc's
Prefetch/Dispatch unit.
Just how exactly does the branch prediction bits for instruction pairs in
the I-Cache utilized.
I'm trying to figure out the consequences of an odd word fetch into an
Instruction cache line with a the fourth
instruction being another branch.
Please cc me as I am currently not on the mailing list.
