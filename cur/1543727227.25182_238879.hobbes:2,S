VGA/serial console devices rarely need to do be bus masters so they
should be fine.

Most of those cases don't matter as the driver should always be calling
pci_set_master() on startup.  Disabling all the bus master bits on ioxapics
in pci space would likely cripple the system.  As they are architectural
hardware and rarely have pci drivers that can enable them.
In the general case it appears to be overkill, incorrect and
insufficient to disable bus mastering on all PCI devices.  Which is
why device_shutdown() calls device specific code.
