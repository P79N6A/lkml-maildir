It seems like just one sleep longer than INTERACTIVE_SLEEP is needed
kick the priority of a process all the way to MAX_BONUS-1 and boost the
sleep_avg, regardless of what the prior sleep_avg was.
So if there is a cpu hog that has long sleeps occasionally, once it woke
up, its priority will get boosted close to maximum, likely starving out
other processes for a while till its sleep_avg gets reduced.  This
behavior seems like something to avoid according to the original code
comment.  Are we boosting the priority too quickly?
