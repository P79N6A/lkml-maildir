Subject: trying to track a change to drivers/isdn/usb-gigaset.c

While looking for something else I stumbled upon an unfamiliar
change to the file drivers/isdn/usb-gigaset.c in the current
git version wrt 2.6.21. git-blame attributes it to d626f62b
which resolves to:
Author: Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo <acme@redhat.com>

    [SK_BUFF]: Introduce skb_copy_from_linear_data{_offset}
    To clearly state the intent of copying from linear sk_buffs, _offset being a
    overly long variant but interesting for the sake of saving some bytes.
    Signed-off-by: Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo <acme@redhat.com>
But I cannot remember seeing that patch via the maintainer
addresses for ISDN or the Gigaset driver, and the LKML archive
doesn't seem to have it either.
Where was that patch discussed? What is its rationale?
And more generally: is there a way to get notified if someone
submits a patch that affects a file of which I am a maintainer?
Thanks,
Tilman
