I've had a running thread about snd-ens1371 issues. And I have no clue wtf is 
going on. On mine, it refuses to detect any joystick. Yet, my problem has 
been going on since _atleast_ 2.6.7. (atleast, from what I've seen.)
Something broke, and it broke hard. Speaking of which... is there anyone out 
there with a ens1371 that actually works right with joysticks?
