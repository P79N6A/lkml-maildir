This one would _easily_ conflict with 8 space tabbing (required
for Linux Kernel coding style).

A third one (usally the one used in the kernel ;-)):
{
   void *a,*b,*b,*c;
   
   a = alloca();
   if ((b = allocb()) == NULL) goto free_a:
   if ((c = allocd()) == NULL) goto free_b:
   if ((d = allocd()) == NULL) goto free_c:
   
   do_real_work(); 
   freed(d); 
free_c:
   freec(c);
free_b:
   freeb(b); 
free_a:
   freea(a); 
}
I'm used to failed allocations. And goto is _perfect_ for
aggregated cleanups ;-)
Why? We have the same with locks, which we _don't_ know, if they
are already up()/unlock()ed. If you use counted semaphores to
assign places in queues you notice that _easily_, because you
have a greater count than the length of the queue.
And there are other examples, where alloc/free of a ressource is
semantically a block structure, which can _not_ determine the
"correct" block level.
