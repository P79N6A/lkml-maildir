How can I avoid that blocking? Or maybe another question - how can I
deliver data from disk to network with minimal copy operations, etc.

_very_ fast frontend web-server :) using as much kernel features as possible

aio does not support direct transfer file->socket. Using some hints,
like aio reading into shared memory and then sendfile from shared
memory, like lighttpd does, is not what I want. My tests showing
that aio-sendfile realization in lighttpd is slower than sendfile.
I think, sendfile uses less copy operations(maybe even zerocopy), than current aio
realizations in kernel.

20k threads and maybe more is too much :). Look at 
http://nginx.net/
senction "Architecture and scalability" for example.

all, that hardware can take and hold :)
