In the allocation path not, but it rewrites the setting algorithm, so
from somebody watching it from userspace it's a completely different
thing, usable for the first time ever in 2.6. Otherwise userspace would
be required to have knowledge about the kernel internals to be able to
set it to a sane value. Plus the new init code is much cleaner too.

Having this patch applied is a major fix. See again the google fix
thread in 2.4.1x.  2.6 is vulnerable to it again. This patch makes the
feature usable and enables the feature as well, which is definitely a
fix as far as an end user is concerned (google was the user in this case).
