Of course that may result in just another band-aid on the current 
scheduler rather than a change.

More to the point, was there a problem with plugable schedulers? It 
would be both technically and politically better to let people try, use, 
and write schedulers for special case loads, just as we have for io 
scheduling.
I didn't find staircase to be the solution to any of my problems, but it 
would be nice to let all the people who are improving schedulers have an 
easy way to try new ideas (easier than building a whole new kernel, that 
is).
