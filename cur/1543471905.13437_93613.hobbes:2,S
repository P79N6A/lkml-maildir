That was a hardware problem. I discovered that DIP switches which
control CPU voltage, bus freq and core/bus multiplier sometimes
do not maintain their settings. Too many overclocking experiments
:-)  (switches designed for 10-20 flips, I made probably 50).
Now I soldered contacts which should be closed. Keyboard works ok.
PS. But... why the hell it worked under DOS/Windoze?!
