Using the absolute numbers and/or structures (i.e. the interface)
needed to progam a device seems like a fine example of fair use, even
when the header file containing them is copyrighted.
Fair use trumps derivation.

I guess a hardware manufacturer who feels their programming
information is worth keeping secret may well argue that they _chose_
the numbers that needed to be fed to their device, and thus they're creative.
But that's silly, and we're in deep shit if ever that argument is
taken seriously because _lots_ of Linux and BSD open source drivers
were developed by studying the behaviour or code of another driver.
