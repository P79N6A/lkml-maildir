Okay. I did that now. However, `depmod -ae` shows some unresolved
symbols:
depmod: *** Unresolved symbols in /lib/modules/2.4.18/kernel/drivers
    /ieee1394/pcilynx.o
depmod: 	i2c_transfer
depmod: 	i2c_bit_del_bus
depmod: 	i2c_bit_add_bus
Since I don't use this module, maybe I am "home-free" I need to try
this on my system at home since my firewire stuff is there.
