Well, anything that shows or needs a back-trace. By definition, it's 
pretty much just debug code.
I sure as hell hope we don't have any actual _semantics_ that depend on 
back-traces, like the broken asynchronous C++ exception handling code etc 
that people have in user space (what a total brain-damage _that_ is!).
