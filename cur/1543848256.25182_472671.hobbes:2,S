In previous work I've done on this I've found that allowing
application-initiated allocations to fail is a right pain: all of userspace
gets all unreliable and applications die all the time.
I realise that it's possible to limit the failures to a particular process,
but it's also possible to let the allocations fail for _all_ processes, in
which case this problem will hurt.
What I found was a reasonable fix for this problem was to limit the
failures to those requests which did not have __GFP_HIGHMEM set.  That way,
userspace allocations work, but kernel-internal allocations are subject to
failures.
That might be worth adding as an additional tunable?
