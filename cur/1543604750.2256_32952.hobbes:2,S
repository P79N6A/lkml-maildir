Well, module unloading requires only a small fraction of the read copy
update infrastructure (synchronize_kernel()), and can be implemented
without any scheduler changes, as it's not at all speed critical.
If nothing else, this thread has served to make more kernel hackers
aware of the technique, so they can try it themselves as desired.
Cheers,
Rusty.
