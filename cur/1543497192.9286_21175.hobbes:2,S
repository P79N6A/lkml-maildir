Thcc gcc "builtins" are generally noticeably worse than the kernel
headers.
Anyway, there is a really simple choice when it comes to compilers: we
will choose the one that generates better code. For a long time it
_seemed_ that egcs would be the choice, but if we have to disable the new
alias code and/or use ugly tricks like the above then the choice is fairly
clear - gcc-2.7.2 will still continue to generate better code. 
I've asked the egcs people to give us some way to tell the compiler what's
going on, but at least so far I haven't had any replies. As I know how
gcc-2.7.2 can be made to generate the code I want, and nobody so far has
told me how to get egcs to do the same, I know which compiler _I_ will
recommend.
