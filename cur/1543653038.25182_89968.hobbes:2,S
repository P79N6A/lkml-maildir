Please CC me, I'm not subscribed.
I'm considering porting the wxWindows framework to the linux framebuffer and on
the search for alternatives I found Dinx ("
http://dinx.sourceforge.net/"
). Dinx
is an experimental windowing system working on linux framebuffer and is build as
or like a kernel module. While the idea behind  Dinx is rather promising, it is
also a rather dead project. The source
("
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=637"
) doesn't compile
anymore. Still I'd like to see Dinx working to get an impression. Is there
anyone out there who could have a look at Dinx and bring it to a usable state?
