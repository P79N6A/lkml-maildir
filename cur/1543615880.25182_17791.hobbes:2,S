Hi,
I am currently trying to install my usb-storage device to use with 2.4.17.
I have my usb device connected and switched on so when i do insmod usb-uhci 
or insmod uhci it automatically picks it up and goes to install it but a 
few seconds after its done that, linux just freezes up and i can't do 
anything except reboot via the reboot switch (keyboard does not work). My 
usb is using a shared irq with onboard sound so i disabled sound in the 
BIOS and retried, only to find it failed again. I dont have enough time to 
check for any errors so i can't figure out the problem and when i check the 
logs there seems to be nothing out of the ordinary.
Using VIA KT266 mobo chipset....
Regards,
Dylan
