Now, seems that PIO manages the default hdparm -tT block size, but DMA
doesn't; but the error messages in the kernel ring buffer aren't
specific.
I let go of hdparm -tT, installed Jörg Schilling's sdd and ran sdd
if=/dev/sr1 -onull -t bs=2048 and lo and behold, it passed and read a
data CD with up to 45x. So the remaining problem is that the ATAPI
drives stick to PIO for data reads.
I tried applying Andrew's ide-akpm on top of SuSE's kernel, to find it
crashes on boot on SuSE's hardware scan.
If that's interesting enough, I can try to dig up the crash messages
(I'll have to use a serial console for that though).
