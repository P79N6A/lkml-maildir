I feel bad asking newbie questions when everybody else seems to be
scrambling to get 2.2 stable, but I don't know where else to turn (I've
searched the list archives). So, here's my question:
I am writing a device driver that needs to handle multiple simultaneous
writes. However, something external to the device driver seems to prevent
this. If a write is pending, no other writes get through to the driver
(even though the pending process is nicely sleeping away). Other I/O calls
get through fine (a new open() call comes through while there is a write
pending, for example), but not additional writes.
Is there something I need to do to tell the "powers that be" that my
driver can handle multiple writes?
Thanks,
Mike
