I think so - lots of "Bad page state" messages as the count bounces
around the 0 mark, but not actually freed.  But when CONFIG_DEBUG_VM
you'll get BUG_ONs.  And I can't swear bad things won't happen some-
where once the count wraps to negative.  Easier to fix than work out
the consequences.
(Of course, Nick is right now proposing a patch to take us back the
other way, back to not accounting the ZERO_PAGE: so the fix needs
to go in, then he'll need to reverse that again in his patch.)
Doesn't fs/binfmt_elf_fdpic.c need the same fix?  It looks slightly
different there, but I think when you look closer there's exactly
the same issue?
