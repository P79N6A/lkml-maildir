Subject: v2.6.19-rc1 regression: printk missing klogd wakeup

Unsurprisingly, v2.6.19-rc1 still contains the problem I reported
for v2.6.18-rc1 under the subject "Linux v2.6.18-rc1: printk delays"
and later (unfortunately not before it made it into v2.6.18) tracked
down through bisecting to
[a0f1ccfd8d37457a6d8a9e01acebeefcdfcc306e] lockdep: do not recurse in printk
Problem description:
> While X is running, output from printk() appears in syslog (eg.
> /var/log/messages) only after a key is pressed on the system keyboard,
> even though it is visible with dmesg immediately.

The problem did not exist in 2.6.17, so I think it qualifies as a
regression.
The following naive patch fixes the problem for me, without any
apparent ill effects (ie. the menace of lockup never manifested
itself):

But I guess for a proper fix the if() condition should rather be
refined a bit than thrown out completely.
