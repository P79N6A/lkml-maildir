Subject: [patch] make sysctl_overcommit_memory enumeration sensible
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I see system admins often confused when they sysctl vm.overcommit_memory.
This patch makes overcommit_memory enumeration sensible.
0 - no overcommit
1 - always overcommit
2 - heuristic overcommit (default)
I don't feel this would break any userspace scripts. If it seems OK, I'll
update the documents.
