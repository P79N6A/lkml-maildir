I'm not saying initramfs is not powerful, and indeed your example is
the common way of parsing cmdline for me too. What I'm saying is that
before nfsroot stops being supported, we'll need a working replacement
(and not "### further parse $arg"), if possible within the kernel tree
so that people who used to build kernels to boot such machines will
still be able to build kernels for them, even if this implies using
an initramfs with some tools in it.
The real danger of removing support for in-kernel features like this
is to leave people with no solution at all (because they don't know
how to proceed), and their workarounds are often worse than the
problem that we tried to fix in the first place.
