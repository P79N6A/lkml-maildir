I think this one needs more thinking ... I did think about adding such a
hook, but I didn't like the idea of it, it just seems unclean. After all
the problem is limited to a very small subset of events, namely NMIs and
page fault traps. One thing I was thinking about is that in both these
cases there's always an entry event and an exit event. ltt_mux could then
coordinate using these events. IOW, if it just got an NMI entry, it
doesn't allow any other event to get logged until it sees the NMI exit
go by ... same for page faults. By doing this, we can just keep just one
hook: ltt_mux. Right?
