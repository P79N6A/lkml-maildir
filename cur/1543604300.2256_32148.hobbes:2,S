I2O provides the basic info needed to check stuff (it uses an HTML interface
bizarrely enough). The DPT/Adaptec doesn't use this so Im not sure what
its monitoring setup is
As to support
Promise sent me the card, and answered questions on firmware funnies
Adaptec wrote their own open source drivers
