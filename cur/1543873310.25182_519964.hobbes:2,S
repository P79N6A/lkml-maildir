Hello,
This patch-set contains UBI, which stands for Unsorted Block Images. This
is closely related to the memory technology devices Linux subsystem (MTD),
so this new piece of software is from drivers/mtd/ubi.
In short, UBI is kind of LVM layer but for flash (MTD) devices. It makes
it possible to dynamically create, delete and re-size volumes. But the
analogy is not full. UBI also takes care of wear-leveling and bad
eraseblocks handling, so UBI completely hides 2 aspects of flash chips
which make them very difficult to work with:
1. wear of eraseblocks;
2. bad eraseblocks.
There is some documentation available at:
http://www.linux-mtd.infradead.org/doc/ubi.html
http://www.linux-mtd.infradead.org/faq/ubi.html
The sources are available via the GIT tree:
git://git.infradead.org/ubi-2.6.git (stable)
git://git.infradead.org/~dedekind/dedekind-ubi-2.6.git (devel)
One can also browse the GIT trees at

This is the third iteration of the post which has fixed most of the stuff
pointed to previously.
