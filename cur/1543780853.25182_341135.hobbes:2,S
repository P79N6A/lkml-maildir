It's a pretty good idea, and thanks for reminding us of it.
It suffers from the general difficulty with fixes within get_user_pages,
that we need down_write(&mm->mmap_sem) to split_vma, and even just to
update vm_flags, whereas get_user_pages is entered with down_read.
Really, we'd prefer not to mess with the vma itself in get_user_pages.
Could mark the ptes instead, perhaps, but that gets very architecture-
dependent.  A separate array?  not so nice if the vma is very large
and the get_user_pages area very small.
I had toyed with leaving the ptes in the parent as writable, made
readonly just in the child; but though that violation could be excused
while get_user_pages is active, it would have to be corrected at the
end, and that gets complicated again.
