Hello. I have questions about updated retrieving routing table.
I deleted a route/entry from the routing table using 'route del...' command, 
and used 'route' to display the routing table. The routing table does not show 
the deleted entry, but the file /proc/net/route still has the deleted entry.
I would like to read the file /proc/net/route to plot a network topology, but 
this file doesn't seems to be updated whenever i deleted an entry.
What file i should i access this updated routing table? or what should i do to 
get the updated table? Any suggestion?
btw, it works fine with adding an entry....
Thank you very much
tan
