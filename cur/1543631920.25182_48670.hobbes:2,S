IIRC there have been prior reports of excessive interrupt disablement
in 2.4.x, and also IIRC it was reported against a more recent kernel.
I think it was suspected there are bug(s) where some code is leaving
interrupts off and someone later unconditionally turns them back on.
Any chance you could upgrade to a more recent kernel and try to
reproduce there? There have been a number of critical bugfixes since 2.4.7
(and although none are particularly pertinent to this issue, people would
probably rather field bug reports for 2.4.19-pre* than 2.4.7).
Cheers,
Bill
