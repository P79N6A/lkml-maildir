Group,
Here's my last try.  I've edited all of the headers (sched.h, param.h, 
limits.h) in /usr/include and /usr/src/linux, I've recompiled the 
shadow-utils and PAM.  My limit is still 32.  Am I missing something - 
obvious?  I did go ahead and upgrade to glibc-2.2-12 and kernel 2.4.3 (with 
edited headers) to no avail.  This has been a really bad problem, I greatly 
appreciate any help at all.  (thanks Jeff Garzik for your 
suggestion).  BTW, please CC me directly.

You gotta change the task struct...
