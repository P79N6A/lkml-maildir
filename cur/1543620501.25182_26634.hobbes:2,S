Ingo, are you sure that you actually saw llseek() causing problems?
And not, say it, ext2_get_block()?
If you've got a heavy holder of some lock + lots of guys who grab it
for a short periods, the real trouble is the former, not the latter.
I'm going to send ext2-without-BKL patches to Linus - tonight or tomorrow.
I really wonder what effect that would have on the things.
