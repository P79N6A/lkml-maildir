That would be fantastic.  I know a fair number of people who
would consider using IOMEGA products if the company worked with
the Linux community in an open manner.  There is such a large
market niche that IOMEGA is missing out on currently due to lack
of support, so it will be great to see them join the ranks!
I'm sure lots of people watching with purchase power will be
anxious to purchase IOMEGA products should IOMEGA become involved
directly with the Linux community in an open source manner.
