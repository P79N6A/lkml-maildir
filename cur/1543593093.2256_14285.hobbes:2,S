Can you check the firmware on the PERC 2/SC?  (You claim you tried a
different system with a dual-channel, but that would be the PERC 2/DC).
There's a bug in the megaraid driver for some versions of the PERC 2/SC
firmware which can cause an oops when the megaraid driver loads.  It's fixed
by upgrading to v3.13 firmware, available by link on
http://domsch.com/linux.
  That *shouldn't* be the problem, as I don't see
the megaraid sign-on message, but it could be.
Also, the onboard SCSI adapter isn't an Adaptec, it's a Symbios 810.
Thanks,
Matt
