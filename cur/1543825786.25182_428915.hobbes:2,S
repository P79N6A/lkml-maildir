Subject: [PATCH 010 of 10] md: Allow the write_mostly flag to be set via sysfs.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/6/1/16

It appears in /sys/mdX/md/dev-YYY/state
and can be set or cleared by writing 'writemostly' or '-writemostly'
respectively.
