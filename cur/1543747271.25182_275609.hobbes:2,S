Hi Linux-Hackers,
I posted this message first to the cdwriter mailing list (
http://www.mail-archive.com/cdwrite
%40other.debian.org/msg07041.html )
but they told me this is a kernel problem, thus I post it here again.
Because I had this DVD-Device running without problem in 2.6.8 I can
exclude that it's a cabel/hw-problem.
Thanks and regards,
 Thomas Fritzsche

Hi all,
I'm using growisofs -Z /dev/hdc=/link/to/iso.iso to burn DVD-Video's. This
works, BUT the system load is very high while burning. I'l checked DMA
setting but DMA is on (and 32 bit). I googled around but can not find a
solution. I tried again and found that after burning dma is off!? I
checked dmesg and found message:
--------------------------------------
hdc: irq timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }
hdc: irq timeout: error=0xd0LastFailedSense 0x0d
hdc: DMA disabled
hdc: ATAPI reset complete
--------------------------------------
I tested a few times and sometimes only the system load is very high but
DMA  is still set after the run, but often DMA setting is disabled and I
get the message above.
My system configuration is:
uname -a
Linux vdr.noto.de 2.4.27-ctvdr-1 #1 Fri Oct 15 18:38:29 UTC 2004 i686
GNU/Linux
hdparm -i /dev/hdc

 IORDY=yes, tPIO={min:120,w/IORDY:120}, tDMA={min:120,rec:120}
 PIO modes:  pio0 pio1 pio2 pio3 pio4
 DMA modes:  mdma0 mdma1 mdma2
 UDMA modes: udma0 udma1 *udma2
 AdvancedPM=no
 * signifies the current active mode
------------------------------
Is this a growisofs problem or a kernel problem? What causes this trouble?
What can I do to avoid this problems.
Thanks for any help and kind regards,
 Thomas Fritzsche
