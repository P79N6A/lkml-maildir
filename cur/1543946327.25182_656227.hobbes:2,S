So far I have edited only init/Kconfig, that's what these 9
patches are for. Next I'll do block/Kconfig. Eventually I expect
to get to net/Kconfig which is where NET_NS is configured,
but I don't know where UTS_NS and IPC_NS come from in 2.6.24.2.
I expect I'll have to start patching against a git tree soon,
to be sure to see the latest code. I assume this should be
Linus' tree?
Is there any actual documentation on user namespaces and friends?
I think I grasp the pid namespaces concept; I am having a little
difficulty visualising what function user namespaces performs.
"provide different user info" isn't a very useful description and
I'd fix it if I understood what it is supposed to mean.
To make a guess at it, how about:
   Enable support for user namespaces.
   This is a function used by container-based virtualisation systems
   (e.g. vservers). User namespaces ensures that processes with the
   same uid which are in different containers are isolated from each other.
   Answer Y if you require container-based virtualisation like
   vservers. If unsure, say N.
Nick.
