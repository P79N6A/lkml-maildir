No question that circular dependencies are a bug in the kernel/modules. 
I just thought, that it would be nice if modprobe would not run crazy and
end up in an endless loop, possible risking the machine to run out of mem
with all the nice side effects this has on Linux. This is especially bad,
because modprobe is called invisibly by kmod.
Here's what happened on the test machine (2.4.0-test9 on Dual Power3):
Swapping like crazy; getting unresponsive; ...
Here's the last output top was able to produce:

I'm afraid I can't wait until the machine recovers, if it ever will.
[2.2 with AA VM would have started to kill processes (which is bad) 
 till it would have finally killed modprobe (which is good);
 but I'm afraid that 2.4 will just not survive at all :-(           ]

This is a pity, because I think the current behaviour is not acceptable,
as it can kill the machine by just being invoked by kmod.
I will try to make sense out of the code and make sure that modprobe
will not go crazy, by either detecting loops (if I can do that in a way
wihtout breaking things) or by limiting the recursion depth. I'll send
you a patch.

Looking forward to it.
