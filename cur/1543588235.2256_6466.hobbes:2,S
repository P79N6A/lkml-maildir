I got that one too, PC is ASUS P2B-DS with two PII-350, 384MB RAM,
3C905B.
I've tried 3C905C to no avail.
The e401 status seems to be that there is too much load on the card to
be treated in the 20 (2.2.17) or 32 (2.2.19, 2.4.x) loops of the
interruption
check routine (stop/hit me if i'm wrong please). 
I think we should try (MM. Donald Becker or Andrew Norton, 
is this a Bad Thing ?) to change max_interrupt_work (3c59x.c, row 171)
to 64
or maybe even higher. Haven't had the guts to try on the production
machine
right now =)
