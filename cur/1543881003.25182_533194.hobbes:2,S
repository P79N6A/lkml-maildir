Considering where it failed and that 2.6.20.3 worked, I would be 
extremely surprised if this wasn't one more report of 
adjust-legacy-ide-resource-setting.patch breaking booting (and we 
already have confirmed reports for this)...
But AFAIK we still don't understand how this patch managed to break 
things.
