	This is an atrocious way to compare a real-time operating system to 
a non-real-time operating system. One would expect that real-time's 
benefits also come at a cost, otherwise all operating systems would 
be real-time operating systems.
	Perhaps Linux can handle more web clients than vxWorks, but can 
Linux guarantee that if the temperature in the core coolant exceeds 
350 degrees, the secondary pump circuit will be activated within 13 
milliseconds?
	A cheap hammer can drive in more nails than a top of the line 
screwdriver.
