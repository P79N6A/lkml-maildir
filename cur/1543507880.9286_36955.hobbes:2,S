  I think that we are not talking about BIOS calls, but about broken BIOS
tables.
  I have three SMP computers around, one has board from Gigabyte, second
from Soltek and third from Chaintech. All are based on Award core and all
do not correctly fill USB->PINTx IRQ mapping, so I have to hardcode it
manually (there is bad subdevice identification in that entry in SMP table,
0 instead of 2).
  And BTW, if you are talking about real ACPI tables, on my Gigabyte (6BXDS,
BIOS 2.5 from July 99) Win2000 do not start with something like that "It
looks like that your system supports ACPI, but we really do not understand,
what firmware filled into tables (***STOP*** 0xA5)". After disabling ACPI
Win2000 instalation was successful, with only one problem: they are not
able to use USB ("Your firmware did not provide all informations needed for
this device") (*) :-(
  I hope that we want to be better.
                                    Best regards,
                                            Petr Vandrovec
                                            vandrove@vc.cvut.cz
(*) I reported it to Gigabyte, but I want to use computer meanwhile too...
