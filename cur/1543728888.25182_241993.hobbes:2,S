I can confirm that this also happens here, on 2.6.8rc4 and possibly
earlier rcs (should probably have reported it earlier). :)
I can burn DVDs with growisofs without problem, but burning an audio
CD with cdrecord OOMs everything and the box chokes.  slabinfo did
not appear to report anything large if I remember correctly, but I'm
not certain.
