*identifier*.
It doesn't give a meaning beyond that, and if you look at other pthread
manpages (say pthread_join) it just wants that identifier back. If you
want to attach meaning to a thread identifier, please come up with a
manpage/standard that actually defines the meaning of it.

and here you 
1) look at implementation details of your specific threading
implementation and 
2) you prove that your analysis is wrong since the implementation you
look at defines it as *unsigned* so it can't be negative. So what your
app does is clearly wrong even within the implementation you look at.
Other implementations are allowed to use different types for this. In
fact, I'd be surprised if NPTL and LinuxThreads would have the same
type... (they'll have the same size for ABI compat reasons of course,
but type... not so sure).
