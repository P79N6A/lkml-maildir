Does this happen irrespective of whether you are plugged in to A/C power 
at the time? Most laptops will go to lower speeds on battery (depending 
on your setup in BIOS), and even if you plug in the power later, 
/proc/cpuinfo is not updated. So please make sure you boot up with A/C 
power and let us know if you see the same thing.
Thanks,
Rahul
