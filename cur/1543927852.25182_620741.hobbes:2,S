Thanks for the response.
I backported that patch to 2.6.23.8, but it didn't make a difference.
I also went ahead and tested 2.6.24-rc3 (with no changes to the existing
config settings):
With the new CPU_IDLE option set to "n", it still hangs, but much less
frequently than on 2.6.23.x. In 25 tries, there were 3 hangs, all after
"input: AT Translated Set 2 keyboard as /class/input/input0".
With CPU_IDLE set to "y", it didn't hang at all in 25 tries. However,
CPU_IDLE=y produces these additional messages, which may explain why:
Marking TSC unstable due to: TSC halts in idle.
...
Time: acpi_pm clocksource has been installed.
Not sure what else to try at this point...
