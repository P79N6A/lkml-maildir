No, you loose one of the nicer features of CML2.

As a specific case this needs doing anyway, to handle SCSI emulation
over IDE, irrespective of the board type.  It needs mid layer but no
SCSI driver and can be done on a PC right now.
As a general question, I prefer selecting machine type foo to mean just
that, you get the devices supported by foo.

In general this is the best option, if you create a non-standard
configuration for machine foo then it is your problem, not everybody
else's.
