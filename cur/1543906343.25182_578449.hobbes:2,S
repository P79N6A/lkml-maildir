Thanks, I used your .config against 60bfba7e8 on x86_64, and still can't 
seem to be able to reproduce the problem:
linux-w027:~ # echo "test" | ./klibc-1.5/usr/utils/shared/cat
test
linux-w027:~ # echo "test" | ./klibc-1.5/usr/utils/static/cat
test
hpa, were you successful reproducing this?
Bret, I can see that you also reported some related segfaults, what were 
your conditions that triggered it please?
