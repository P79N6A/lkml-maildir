No, of course not, but this has *nothing* to do with UDP. The IP socket 
itself is flow controlled, and so is the TX queue of the network driver.
Let me give you another example: ping -f. If what you said were true, ping -f 
would send packets as fast as the CPU can generate into the black hole 
called an IP raw socket, right? Well, that just doesn't happen, because 
sendto/sendmsg will block until there is enough space in the TX queue of 
the raw socket.
I'll state again: if data (UDP or otherwise) is lost after sendto() 
returns success but before it hits the wire, something is BROKEN in that 
IP stack.
