I won't use the word "frozen", so "chilled" is nearer the mark.  I just 
pulled Tejun's hotplug work into libata-dev.git#upstream (and thus 
#ALL).  This should be the last major API/probe-path/etc. disturbance 
until 2.6.18, and so, would be a good testing point.  Regenerate all 
your libata patches that broke :)
After merging some non-Tejun patches -- yes, others, I haven't forgotten 
you -- I'll post a full changelog and a patch that users can easily test.
