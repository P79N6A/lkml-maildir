It took several years to eliminate the old error handler, too...
If something's already broken, does it really matter how many pieces it's in?
There a siesmic changes coming to the scsi layer anyway, particularly if we 
want to implement the new tag queuing code.  The consistent alloc is virtually 
a simple conversion recipe, so it shouldn't be too difficult to tack this 
small change on to a set of much bigger ones.
