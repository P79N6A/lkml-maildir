I don't see any way of getting around virtualizing the IO port space.
(by that I mean encoding more info in the upper IO port address bits)

Well, make it a CONFIG_XXX option for your arch and the people who
insist on doing complicated things will have to live with complicated
solutions. I don't have a better idea.

Correct. For some reason, I thought alpha (or sparc? hose number?) did this
as well.

That's right. That happens after the bus walk but before drivers see
the device in pci_fixup_bus().

right.

I don't know enough about your arch to answer that.

In theory yes. But davem already wrote:

Right. I meant the underlying implementation of inb/outb.

yes.

Really? I expected ISA memory to look like reguler uncacheable memory
and the drivers would simply dereference the address. But I'm not an
expert on how ISA busses work...

I have to defer to someone like Alan Cox or Davem or someone who has
a clue about VGA. I don't. Like sparc, parisc doesn't support VGA.
Alan is the only person I know of who's even considered plugging a VGA
card into a parisc box.

In short, where the HW doesn't route transactions down the right bus

It sounds like the HW will do (some of?) the routing.
