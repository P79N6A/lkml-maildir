Hi all, I own a HP Compaq nc4000 that has an mmc card reader from the O2
Micro company. 
00:0b.0 CardBus bridge: O2 Micro, Inc. OZ711M1/MC1 4-in-1 MemoryCardBus
Controller (rev 20)
00:0b.1 CardBus bridge: O2 Micro, Inc. OZ711M1/MC1 4-in-1 MemoryCardBus
Controller (rev 20)
00:0b.2 System peripheral: O2 Micro, Inc. OZ711Mx 4-in-1 MemoryCardBus
Accelerator
I reached to the mmc wiki and found a page which had information about
this controller and others.
http://mmc.drzeus.cx/wiki/Controllers/O2/OZ711Mx
I then proceeded to contact the company asking for a driver. I got a
rapid response with a driver tarball, apparently under the GPL.
Unfortunately it did not compile because I use a 2.6.17 kernel, in which
the PCMCIA API has changed. I'm trying to fix it but my programming
knowledge is limited.
I have attached the driver to the same wiki page, and contacted their
mailing list but they pointed me to LKML.
I am ready to interact with someone and try to get this driver in shape.
Looking forward to your help.
