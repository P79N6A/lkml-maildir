Subject: [PATCH 0/7] KVM: Suspend and cpu hotplug fixes
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The following patchset makes kvm more robust wrt cpu hotunplug, and
makes suspend-to-ram actually work.  Suspend-to-disk benefits from
the cpu hotunplug improvements as well.
The major issue is that KVM wants to disable the virtualization
extensions at a point in time when no user processes are schedulable
on the victim cpu.  No current notifier exists, so a new one, CPU_DYING,
is added for the purpose.
Should there be no objections, I will submit this patchset for inclusion
in 2.6.22, and backport it to 2.6.21.stable.
