Application touching itself would be *evil*. 
You might extend my approach if something like
if ps | grep gimp; then cat /usr/bin/gimp > /dev/null; fi
or something like that. It is definitely less evil than gimp doing it
itself.

User programs should *never ever* do unneeded work. Touching itself is
unneeded and evil for memory managment.

Agreed.
