`current' is correct for reads and synchronous writes.  It is usually wrong
for normal pagecache writeback.
If we're going to do this sort of thing, the IO priority and any associated
state should be placeed into struct io_context, which is the structure with
which the IO scheduler tracks per-process stuff.
The io_context is constructed just once across teh lifetime of a process,
so we'd need to update it occasionally to pick up dynamic priority shifts,
changes in niceness, etc.  Probably do that inside a read.
I have a vague feeling that co-opting the scheduling priority information
for use as IO priority will end up being a mistake.  It may be best to
treat these things separately from the outset.
