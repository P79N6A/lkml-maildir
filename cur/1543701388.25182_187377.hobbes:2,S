Uh, Unix systems (Linux included) do not use the filename of the device
node at all.  Those are just names for you, the user.
The kernel uses the device number to understand what device user-space
is trying to access.  The kernel associates the device with a device
number.  Normally that number is static, and known a priori, so we just
create a huge /dev directory with all possible devices and their
assigned numbers (you can see these numbers with ls -la).
But if the kernel _tells_ user-space what the device number is, for each
device as it is created, we do not need a static /dev directory.  We can
assemble the directory on the fly and device numbers really no longer
matter.  This is what udev does.
