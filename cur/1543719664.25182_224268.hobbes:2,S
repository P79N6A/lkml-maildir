Root-squashing only modifies the way your client credentials are seen on
the server; it isn't applied to uid's that are returned to the client
e.g.  when listing a directory.  So if you create a new file as a user
on the client, that new file will be given anonymous uid and gid.  But
if you "ls" a directory, the uid's you see will be unaffected by
squashing.
