How large are these files?  Are they all in a single directory?  How
many files are in the directory? 
Ugh. Why don't you just write to a DB instead?  It sounds like you're
writing small records, with one record to a file.  It can work, but
when you're doing thousands per-minute, the open/close overhead is
starting to dominate.  Can you just amortize that overhead across a
bunch of writes instead by writing to a single file which is more
structured for your needs?

Netapps usually scream for NFS writes and such, so it sounds to me
that you've blown out the NVRAM cache on the box.  Can you elaborate
more on your hardware & Network & Netapp setup?  
Of course, you could also be using sucky NFS configuration, so we need
to see your mount options as well.  You are using TCP and NFSv3,
right?  And a large wsize/rsize values too?  
Have you also checked your NetApp to make sure you have the following
options turned OFF:
	nfs.per_client_stats.enable
	nfs.mountd_trace
Seeing your exports file and output of 'options nfs' would help.

The problem is that O_NONBLOCK on files open doesn't make sense.  You
either open it, or you don't.  How long it takes to comlete isn't part
of the spec.
But in this case, I think you're doing something hokey with your data
design.  You should be opening just a handful of files and then
streaming your writes to those files.   You'll get much more
performance.
Also, have you tried writing to a local disk instead of via NFS to see
how local disk speed is?

epoll isn't going to help you much here, it's the open which is
causing the delay, not the writing to the file itself.
Maybe you need to be caching more of your writes into memory on the
client side, and then streaming them to the NetApp later on when you
know you can write a bunch of data at once.
But honestly, I think you've done a bad job architecting your
application's backend data store and you really need to re-think it
through.  
Heck, I'm not even much of a programmer, I'm a SysAdmin who runs
Netapps and talks the users into more sane ways of getting better
performance out of their applications.  *grin*.
