If they open "filename" then they get what you calls the primary fork.
If they open "filename/someforkname" then they get some other fork, using
exactly the same mechanism as when they opens "directoryname/somefilename"
And if you want to use the old tools to look at some forks, just do a
$ cd filename
It will work if "filename" happens to be a file-as-dir thing, then do
$ ls
And you'll see the forks by name.  Because the "forks" are merely
plain files in a subdirectory. 
The only new thing needed is the ability for something to be both
file and directory at the same time.  Some tools will need
a update - usually only because they blindly assume that a directory
isn't a file too, or that a file can't be a directory too.  Remove the 
mistaken
assumption and things will work because the underlying system
calls (chdir or open) _will_ work.

Few advantages over directories perhaps, but other implementatins
don't have more advantages over directories than this one. 
Requiring another syscall to open forks other than the primary
breaks _all_ existing software because it obviously don't use that
syscall yet.  And then it doesn't provide any advantages over the
file-as-plain-directory way. . .

The distinction might not be important.  A directory can be seen
as a multi-stream file without the main stream.  And there's always
"stat" which should be able to tell what you're looking at.

Sure, implementing it well will take effort, wich is why it is important
to find a good way of doing it so the effort won't be wasted.
