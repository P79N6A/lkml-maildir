While you've got irq's disabled, drain_array() (the function my patch removes)
acquires the cache spin_lock, then releases it.  Cache_reap then acquires
it again (with irq's having been off the entire time).  My testing has found
that simply acquiring the lock once while irq's are off results in fewer
excessively long latencies.
Results probably vary somewhat depending on the circumstance.
