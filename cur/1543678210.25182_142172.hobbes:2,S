And further then that, we loose less precision in some of the math so we
don't have the single second wobbles that were initially seen.

Really, I'm fine with the current semantics. At boot time the system
clock may not have been correct, and was corrected only after NTP
started up later in the boot sequence. So you could have some very funky
btimes. 
Even the current definition of btime = now - uptime has its own quirks
(when systems are suspended uptime doesn't increment, etc) but I think
its more likely to be correct then any other method (assuming the time
now is more accurate then time at boot thanks to ntp or whatnot). 
I'm curious, how are people using the btime value? I'd think uptime and
gettimeofday would be more useful bits of info, so I'd like to hear
more.
thanks
