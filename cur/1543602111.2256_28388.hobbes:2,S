Hi kernel hackers, 
As soon as 2.4.10 was out, I got the patch and tested it again. 
The problem is still there and did not get better at all. 
Please have a look at that: 
How to reproduce: Get the slowest computer you have and 
execute the file creation script as mentioned in my previous e-mail 
(appended below). 
The faster the computer and the more RAM, the more files you have 
to create. Try increasing their number from 300 to 600 or 1000. 
Try running it several times; turn off swap. 
The symptomes are as follows: The file counter raises quickly until 
at some point it begins to raise slowly only (2-4 files/sec on a P100 
with 5 year old hardware). The hd is then accessed all the time and 
the hd's head is moved around continuously making things really slow. 
If you still cannot reproduce it, make sure you have some applications 
running (X, windowmanager, xterm) and try executing `sync' in 
another XTerm while the file creation script is running. 
When I tried, sync did not return until all files were created and 
the creation was awefully slow (steady hd accessed & head move). 
>Is there nobody out there who can try & reproduce this?!
To me, it seems this is either a cache/buffer/flush issue or a 
reiserfs journal congestion issue. 
Regards, 
Wolly
