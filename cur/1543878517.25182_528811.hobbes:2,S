>From SuSv3:
        If a file is removed from or added to the directory after the
        most recent call to opendir() or rewinddir(), whether a
        subsequent call to readdir() returns an entry for that file is
        unspecified.
For NFS, the results in the above case would be governed by the caching
rules: the client is not strictly required to revalidate the cache
except on opendir(). However if the client itself is the one changing
the directory, it will in practice cause the cache to be invalidated,
and the directory contents to be read in again from scratch.
