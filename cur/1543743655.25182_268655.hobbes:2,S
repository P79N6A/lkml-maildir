Yes I think you are right.

I agree it is somewhat misleading. And even if _get would synchronize
with _put taht wouldmean that the caller does not have a valid reference
and the kernel will crash there next time callers uses the object in
question.
I think we just have lay down the rules that one needs to get a reference
to an object in the following cases:
- object creation (first reference)
- linking some other object to the object in question. Every link to the
  object should increase reference count.
- before passing object to another thread of execution to guarantee that
  the object will live long enough for both threads.
This we can get rid of the litter in form:
if (get_bus(bus)) {
                sysfs_remove_file(&bus->subsys.kset.kobj, &attr->attr);
                put_bus(bus);
        }
sysfs_remove_file should do just fine by itself, if caller does not have bus
reference it's its fault.
Greg, what do you think?

I actually spent quite few days thinking about this problem and here
is what I come up with:
You have bus core module that provides generic release function for
devices on the bus. When object is registered you bump up module
count for the core module.
You also have modues that provide devices. At device unregister time
they do all device-specific cleanup, but leave attributes (and memory)
handled by core modules intact. This allows to unload device module
safely at any time and then when reference to the last generic attribute
is dropped the generic cleanup finally removes last traces of the device.

As Al Viro pointed out "rmmod module < /sys/bus/devices/xxxx/attr"
will deadlock the kernel with this scheme.

I think this is an overkill and will inflate every kobject out there,
unless you will find a hole in my scheme...
