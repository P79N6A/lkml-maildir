Well, we can find this merely by looking at the page tables
themselves, so that shouldn't be a problem.

This could only happen when you truncate a file that's
been mapped by various nonlinear VMAs, so truncate can't
get rid of the pages...
I suspect there are two ways to fix that:
1) on truncate, scan ALL the ptes inside nonlinear VMAs
   and remove the pages
2) don't allow truncate on a file that's mapped with
   nonlinear VMAs
Either would work.
