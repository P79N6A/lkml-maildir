Note, I went into the office yesterday, and tried my boot disk with Gary's
changes on the older PowerStack-1 I have in the office (603, no L2 cache, 48
meg of non-pairity memory), and it wouldn't boot due to insufficient memory.
As I mentioned, it does boot fine on my PowerStack-II (Utah, 604e, 128 meg of
memory, 512K L2 cache).
