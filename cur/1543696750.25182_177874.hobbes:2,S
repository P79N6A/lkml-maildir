thanks for your answer.
I ran memtest for a whole night yesterday (again) : nothing.
I have never had any problem with gcc. execpt that sometimes after a big
compiling I have some files damaged but _they_are_not_the_ones_used_
by_gcc_. they always are in another directory.
I ran the test with dd and bzip2 : no problem.
Yet I'm afraid it is too late. I switched to ext3 today as my all system
was gradually becoming unusable after compiling large apps. I was fed up
with rebuilding partitions.
Now, it runs fine. but it might not mean anything about my hardware ...
I 'll try this.
Anyway I'm willing to explore the problem; in particular because some
other people seem to have the same problem.
Moreover reiserfs is faster. I liked it and I'd like to come back to it.
Note: I kept the original reiserfs partition with the errors. So if
someone needs any log to figure out where the problem comes from I have
everything at hand. I'm also willing to perform other tests. 
regards.
Philippe Rouquier.
