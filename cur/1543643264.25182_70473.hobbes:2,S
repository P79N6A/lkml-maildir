Yes, this is a wonderful test.  Very real-world, easy to do and it
tickles a few fairly serious performance problems which we have.

I have issues with irman (I think - didn't read the code really
closely).
It appears to always perform file overwrites - seeking over files,
rewriting them.
This tends to cause best-case behaviour in the VM.  The affected pages
are tucked up out of the way on the active list and we do quite well.
If instead the background application is writing _new_ files then
everything falls apart.
I'd suggest that you stick with the kernel compile as the workload,
and vary the background activity a bit.  Try tiobench.
(oh, and try turning on everything in the `input' menu; that might
get the keyboard working again in 2.5)
