Subject: [RFC] [DRAFT] [udev PATCH] First attempt at vendor RAID support in 2.6
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
some time ago, I started to work on a 2.6 kernel compatible successor for
ATARAID.
Since this project is becoming bigger and bigger and I would like some
input, the current version of my raiddetect program is attached for criticism.
The fact that I did not extend Wilfried Weissmann's EVMS plugin is not
meant to discredit his work, however I found it easier to implement
something outside EVMS. I made the structure of my program as generic as
possible so integration into EVMS should be really easy if you want that.
What works:
- SilicomImage/Promise/Highpoint RAIDs are recognized and a list of disks
belonging to an ATARAID is output if you call "raiddetect -s"
What doesn't work:
- Distinguishing between disks that are part of an ATARAID array and those
 that are not if both have an ATARIAD superblock. (Well, it should work
for Highpoint)
- Setting up the ATARAID devices via device-mapper
What I need:
- People looking at the *_sb_helper functions to tell me if there is more
magic I can check for
- Criticism of coding style/ missing abstraction
- People checking the numerous FIXMEs
- More data about Medley/Highpoint vendor superblocks (can I check for
bogus values?)
- Help with sorting out who owns which copyrights
A few words about my implementation:
The hasraidmagic bitfield in struct harddisk is probably a misnomer. If a
bit is set it means that we found a superblock of the corresponding type
and the disk can not be accessed as a plain disk (i.e. we need to setup
something).
raiddetect is a patch against udev-023 and should compile cleanly against
klibc and glibc.
Executing "raiddetect" will show nearly all info gathered about the block
devices present in the system, whereas "raiddetect -s" should give you
only a list of devices currently suspected to be part of an ATARAID array.
Regards,
Carl-Daniel
