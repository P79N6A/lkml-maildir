Hi,
I  wrote a small app yesterday that updates a file by mmapping the 
file (RW), changing the thing around, and then exiting. 
This did not trigger a change in the mtime of the file. Thus rsync
didn't pick up that the file had changed.
I understand that tracking every change to a RW mmapped file is
costly, and thus unfeasable, but shouldn't then the close cause a
mtime update?
The server where this happened is running 2.6.21, so my apologies if
this has already been corrected.
	Roger.
