P2 300 (Asus P97), 128M, 
1 x eepro100 onboard
1 x aic7890 onboard
1 x eepro100 PCI
2 x Adaptec 2940 PCI
I boot from initrd, loading the eepro module first,
then the scsi module.
Afterwards, root is changed to the scsi disk and init runs.
On configuration of eth0 the system locks up hard.
What I found out is:
The BIOS always puts one SCSI-controller and the onboard
eepro on the same irq. This is usually no problem.
What happens is:
BIOS assigns IRQ, eepro loads but is not ifconfiged yet.
ifconfig eth0 shows irq 15.
aic7xxx loads, /proc/interrupts shows aic7xxx only.
if eth0 is ifconfiged now, it tries to register the irq (?)
and goes boom.
If I load the eepro, ifconfig it and then load aic7xxx
they both show up in /proc/interrupts on the same irq and work.
This problem hits few people but I think it should get fixed.
I would appreciate a hint on where to look in the code and I 
am happy to help anyone with testing.
First experienced with 2.2.0-pre5-ac1,
no problem in 2.1.125, problem remains
for 2.2.0-pre7-ac6.
