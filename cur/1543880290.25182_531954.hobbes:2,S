That is what I referred to as error path. Btw, with positive return
value we end up in subsequent call to input which will free callback
under lock as expected.
I do not object against the patch, just want to make a clear vision about
dumps - if callback is allocated to be used in dump only, then we could
just free it there without passing to next round.

So far it is only netfilter and gennetlink, we would see huge dump 
from netlink_sock_destruct.
Anyway, that is possible situation, thanks for clearing this up.
