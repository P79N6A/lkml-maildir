And probably in general:
+       for (i = 0; i < mod->num_syms; i++)
+               if (!__find_symbol(mod->syms[i].name, &owner, &crc, 1)) {
+                       name = mod->syms[i].name;
+                       ret = -ENOEXEC;
+                       goto dup;
__find_symbol returns the value, or 0 on failure.  This test is
backwards, as is the one below it.
