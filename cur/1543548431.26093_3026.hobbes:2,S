We thought about this too (filesystems are where I got into kernel hacking),
but dismissed it as a Linux only solution.  As much as I'd like it to be
otherwise, BK is not a Linux only product.  Whatever we do needs to work on
NT (shudder) as well as all the dinosaur Unixen.
We do have more to work with because we have both the revision history and
the checked out file in each work area.  So we can play games with those
to try and simulate the "what's changed since" operator.  It's NFS which
screws that up.
