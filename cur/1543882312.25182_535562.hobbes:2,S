One possible issue is that /proc/acpi/power_resource/ is an empty directory.
Otherwise, the ACPI information seems to be fine:
# cat /proc/acpi/ac_adapter/ACAD/state
state:                   on-line
# cat /proc/acpi/ac_adapter/ACAD/state
state:                   off-line
# cat /proc/acpi/battery/BAT0/state
present:                 yes
capacity state:          ok
charging state:          discharging
present rate:            0 mA
remaining capacity:      7072 mAh
present voltage:         12487 mV
When I unplug the power cable, /proc/acpi/battery/BAT0/state (present
rate) shows that current flowing from the battery.
# cat /proc/acpi/button/lid/LID0/state
state:      closed
# cat /proc/acpi/button/lid/LID0/state
state:      open
