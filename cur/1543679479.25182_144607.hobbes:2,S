Hi,
I am writing a driver code for IDE Interface, and would like to start a thread in it, which could write to a file at some initialization of proc value. But, when I do this, my kernel hangs. And the file is also not created. Could someone tell the reason for this. Is it coz I have a thread in the IDE Driver?
Thanks in advance.
