Sorry, it's a legacy from trying to debug #5112, and I've removed it
for getting the above dmesgs.  I'm not even sure what that option does
since it's not documented in the kernel-parameters.txt, but it does
increase the amount of debugging info.

For the above dmesgs I booted with acpi_dbg_level=0x10
acpi_dbg_layer=0x10 and then did two sleep-wake cycles with no thermal
module (both went fine), then one cycle with the thermal module loaded
(went fine), and then the usual failing second sleep with the thermal
module still loaded.  The sleep-wake cycles themselves (i.e. once the
system booted) were done with acpi_debug_level=0x1F rather than the
0x10 boot value.
Let me know if there's a different permutation of debug options that I
should try.  I wasn't sure whether you meant that I should leave all
the debug values at 0x10.  Or whether I should still include
acpi_debug=0xffffffff on top of the other options.
