Please justify your assertion that using cramfs on flash is dumb.
What would be not dumb?  In an embedded system with addressable Flash
the linear addressing cramfs is simple and elegant solution.
Removing support for block based access would drastically reduce the
complexity of cramfs.  The non-block access bits of code are trivial
in comparison.  Specifically which part of my patch represents
unwarranted, unfixable cludge?

There is often no need for the complexity of the MTD for a readonly
compressed filesystem in the embedded world.   I am intrigued by the
suggestion of a generic get_xip_page() for mtd-based devices.  I fail
to see how get_xip_page() is not highly filesystem dependant.  How
might a generic one work?
