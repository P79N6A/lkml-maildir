Hi,
According to 
http://www.kernel.org
, the latest stable kernel version is
2.4.2. The latest prepatch version is 2.4.3-pre3.
In order to get a full 2.4.3-pre8 kernel do I have to:
A. download linux-2.4.2.tar.gz and all the patch-2.4.3-preX.gz and apply
them in succession or,
B. download linux-2.4.3.tar.gz (exists ?) and then apply the all patches or,
C. download linux-2.4.3-pre7.tar.gz (exists ?) and apply only
patch-2.4.3-pre8.gz ?
