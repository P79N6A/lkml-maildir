  Hi, all. I've just released version 1.2.2 of my devfsd (devfs
daemon) at: 
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/
This works with devfs-patch-v111.
The main change is that devfsd now supports variable expansion. This
makes the config file far more flexible. The config file format has
changed and now allows multiple arguments to be passed to external
programmes.
In addition, devfsd now creates mandatory symlinks (/dev/fd,
/dev/stdin, /dev/stdout and /dev/stderr). A special boot script is now
no longer needed.
				Regards,
					Richard....
