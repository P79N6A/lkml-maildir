I didn't have any actual nfs mounts at the time but I tried it
with an otherwise similar system. It went through, got to freeing
memory, showed me a bunch of fullstops being drawn and then went
into an endless BUG loop. All I could pick out (after many a moment
of staring) was 'schedule in atmoic'.
I'll do a proper test with a console cable present in a few days. I
can't atm cos I'm not on the same network and don't have a 2nd 
computer to hook up the null-modem cable to.
Pre-empt is on btw.

Martin's distress was in contrast to the bitter satisfaction of some
of his fellow marines as they surveyed the scene. "The Iraqis are sick
people and we are the chemotherapy," said Corporal Ryan Dupre. "I am
starting to hate this country. Wait till I get hold of a friggin' Iraqi.
No, I won't get hold of one. I'll just kill him."
