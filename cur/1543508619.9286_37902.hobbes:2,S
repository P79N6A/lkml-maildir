Hi Juan,
  no, it is not possible. It would require user authentication in kernel
space (which is impossible due to U.S. crypto laws & maybe some patents)
or tight connection to some userspace daemon (which I'm lazy to write...).
  Also, I do not see any reason for this. Of course, it could be nice if
you can modify object properties by dd/cat/vi, but I do not think that it is
good idea. You can write some nice userspace tool like 'netadmin'...
Infrastructure should be there in ncpfs-2.2.0.17 (delayed for another
month).
  Maybe I'll forced to implement some kernel-level NDS support
after Novell finishes DSS (distributed storage services), but last time
I asked there was even no API for >4GB files (they are accessible from
server only :-( ), and everything about 'junctions', sharing physical
space between volumes and so on was only on paper, pre-alpha or demo...
Maybe this changed during vacation, but I do not believe.
  If you have some problem for which you need NDS access, please mail
me directly (or through linware@sh.cvut.cz list, which is right place
to ask NCP/NDS questions)...
                                                    Best regards,
                                                        Petr Vandrovec
                                                        vandrove@vc.cvut.cz
