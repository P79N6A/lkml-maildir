Has anybody thought implementing some kind on tmpfs so that the
disk space consumed by swap partition(s) and swap files is also
used as /tmp?
I do normally use 128 MB swap and /tmp partitions on every system
by default. Usually either /tmp or swap space is too small.
Additional swap files help when running out of swap, but nothing
helps if /tmp is full. It would be neat if I could get more
(temporary) space to /tmp by creating additional swap files.
