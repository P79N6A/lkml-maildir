Ok, that's a different (opposite) question and so if the answer previously
was "Yes" then obviously the answer to this one is "No". I.e. it is not
worth retaking the lock for the sake of reducing contention on the
lock. And it is not just a couple of extra instructions but it is also a
bus lock (or cache lock if you are lucky, on P6 only). And that is exactly
what my patch does -- removes the unnecessary bus locking and at least 2
instructions.

PS. Your previous statement (when clarified and explained by you in this
message) made me think that you misread the patch, i.e. saw "+" when there
was "-" -- I removed those lines and not added them... Here is the patch
again for you to see it clearer:
