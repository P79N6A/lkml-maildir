I have no idea who else would be using such a feature. Relaxing the tight 
memory restrictions on stack use may allow placing larger structures on 
the stack in general.
I have some concerns about the medium NUMA systems (a few dozen of nodes) 
also running out of stack since more data is placed on the stack through 
the policy layer and since we may end up with a couple of stacked 
filesystems. Most of the current NUMA systems on x86_64 are basically 
two nodes on one motherboard. The use of NUMA controls is likely 
limited there and the complexity of the filesystems is also not high.
