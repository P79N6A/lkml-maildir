	Except that you all havn't been looking at actual kernel code.  Here's
an actual segment of code from the kernel (arch/sparc64/kernel/traps.c):
        printk("SHIT[%s:%d]: "
               "(PP[%016lx] CACH[%016lx] CTX[%x] g1g3[%016lx] g2[%016lx]) ",
               current->comm, current->pid,
               pgd_phys, pgd_cache, ctx, g1_or_g3, g2);
        printk("SHIT[%s:%d]: "
               "[PP[%016lx] CACH[%016lx] CTX[%x:%x]] PC[%016lx:%016lx]\n",
               current->comm, current->pid,
               __pa(current->mm->pgd),
               pgd_val(current->mm->pgd[0]),
               current->mm->context & 0x3ff,
               current->tss.ctx,
               regs->tpc, regs->tnpc);
	As you can see, LOTS of info is printed out.  I don't really follow what
it all means, except the 'SHIT', which happily tells me something BAD happened. :)
	Of course, for all I know 'SHIT' could be a valid reister. ;)
