You only want 8K if you are talking to a machine with the BSD vfs [1]
and 8K page size - otherwise 4K is faster. At that point you are really into
"user tune it right" not into making amd guess it right. I don't think picking
4K and forcing the user to set 8K when talking to Solaris sparc, and the like
is a bug.
[1] BSD systems are only generally capable of doing page sized I/O and NFS I/O
is synchronous. The page sized I/O is not an issue except when dealing
with an awkward NFS client. BSD libc's and apps naturally use page or
multipage I/O and its a win for lots of other stuff. When it combines with
the BSD UFS fragment behaviour you really don't want to be doing synchronous
I/O under page size.
