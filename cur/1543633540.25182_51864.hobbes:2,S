Maybe.
I have an oldish OSB4 here and beating on it only with the CDROM
(disks are all SCSI) I don't ever seem to see this problem:
00:00.0 Host bridge: ServerWorks CNB20LE Host Bridge (rev 05)
        Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 48
00:00.1 Host bridge: ServerWorks CNB20LE Host Bridge (rev 05)
        Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 48
I think what is really required is input from ServerWorks/Broadcom
about this.
