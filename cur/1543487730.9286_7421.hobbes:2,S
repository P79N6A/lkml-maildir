After I posted my last message on MOSIX, I went and scoured their
website for information.  My current understanding is that MOSIX
is a NON-GPL binary only module, and that the modifications to
the kernel that they make, and that are needed for proper MOSIX
operation *ARE* GPL'd.
This opens up some "Gates" IMHO.  So, if someone wants to hack a
feature into the kernel, and it requires kernel source
modification, they can just GPL their kernel source mods, and
then put whatever they like into binary modules?
IMHO, this SUCKS.  I say, *NO* thanks.  Then Microsoft can put a
big 10Mb GPL'd mod in the kernel that provides what is needed for
their external embrace and extend addon binary modules, and we
are FUCKED.
I'm getting sick of seeing stuff like this, and loopholes found
in our licensing mechanisms.  I love free software, but every day
that passes by, I'm feeling more and more in agreement with
Richard Stallman.  Perhaps RMS is much more visionary than he
gets credit for.
As a side note.  How difficult would it really be for someone to
SQUASH MOSIX by releasing a FULLY GPL'd product that is as
functional or more?
I guess this aspect will win in the end.  Long live GPL!
