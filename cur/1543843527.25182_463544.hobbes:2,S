Right, I've been sidetracked with some other things, but I'm hoping to
get back on it soon.

Right, you'll probably never be able to mmap to a "tail page".   I'm
actually trying a couple different approaches to compare the trade-off
between performance and intrusiveness.  On the less intrusive end, data
would be copied into a smaller buffer after it is read into a full page.
The more ambitious approach would have the smaller buffers aligned to
the sector size (and sized to the block size), and data is read, and
sometimes written, directly into them.

Peter, thanks for cc'ing me.
