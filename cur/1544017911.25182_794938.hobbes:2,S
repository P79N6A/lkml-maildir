The problem comes when we want to instrument a library, not the
executable itself. In this case, we would only have to relink the
library, not the application. In some cases, with a proprietary
application, it would be impossible to recompile the application per se.
So I don't see this as a clean solution. I just looked at SIGWINCH,
which is used in libraries (at least by ncurses), which looked rather
promising, but even there, ncurses detects if it is set to the default
handler and if not, it will refuse to connect to it. :(
Maybe we could create a new sigaction sa_flag which would give us the
ability to add a signal handler prior to the standard signal chain ?
e.g. :
SA_CHAIN
        Adds a signal handler to this signal's signal handler chain.
        The signal handler is called at the beginning of the chain.
        If sigaction() is called again with the same sa_sigaction with
        the SA_CHAIN flag set, it will return the next handler in the
        chain in "oldact". Standard sigaction() and signal() users
        should not notice any difference with the standard behavior.
        Using sa_sigaction (rather than sa_handler) is mandatory.
        SA_CHAIN implies SA_SIGINFO.
SA_UNCHAIN
        Removes a signal handler from this signal's signal handler
        chain.
Example use :
#include <signal.h>
#include <stdio.h>
void sigio_tracing_handler(int signum, siginfo_t *siginfo, void *ucontext)
{
  struct sigaction thissig, nextsig;
  thissig.sa_flags = SA_CHAIN;
  thissig.sa_sigaction = sigio_tracing_handler;
  if (!sigaction(signum, &thissig, &nextsig)) {
    if (nextsig.sa_handler != SIG_IGN && nextsig.sa_handler != SIG_DFL)
      if (nextsig.sa_flags & SA_SIGINFO)
        nextsig.sa_sigaction(signum, siginfo, ucontext);
      else
        nextsig.sa_handler(signum);  /*
                                      * Next in chain is standard (not
                                      * SA_CHAIN not SA_SIGINFO) signal
                                      * handler.
                                      */
  }
}
int main(void)
{
  struct sigaction act, oldact;
  int ret;
 
  /* signal handler installation */
  act.sa_flags = SA_CHAIN;
  act.sa_sigaction = sigio_tracing_handler;
  ret = sigaction(SIGIO, &act, &oldact);
  if (ret) {
    printf("Problem installing sigio_tracing_handler SIGIO handler\n");
    exit(1);
