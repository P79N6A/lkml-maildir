is this normal, that we dont have a rate limit in those functions? And even
worse, that there is no error handling like signalling this back to the
channel? In this case this looks especially annoying, since it is a state
changing event, if when lost may totally screw up the state engine (if i
understand the comment "Send event (connection, disconnection, etc) to X.25
socket layer" right.
