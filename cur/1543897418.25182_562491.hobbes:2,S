GPLv2 section 3.
    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
    making modifications to it.
I believe this states that the source code has to be in the preferred
form for making modifications and not some other form that sucks rocks.
As far as your argument that making it difficult or impossible to obtain
the source code could be in compliance. I don't see how (intentionally)
making something difficult could not be interpreted as a restriction so
it still violates section 6 of the GPLv2.
And yes, I do realize that you intentionally tried to come up with your
example to somehow bring tivoization to the source code. However
although the GPLv2 doesn't address the freedom to use (and specifically
does not grants the user a right to run a modified version of the
program on some specific piece of hardware), it does (try) to address
the recipients rights to copy, distribute and modify.
