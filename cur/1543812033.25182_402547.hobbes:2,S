Hello, I use SUSE 10.0 with all updates and actual kernel 2.6.13-15.8 as 
provided from SUSE (just self compiled to optimize for Athlon64, SMP, 
and HZ=100), with an Asus A8N-E motherboard, and an Athlon64x2 CPU. 
This host is used with VMware GSX server running 6 Linux client and one 
Windows client host. There's a SW-RAID1 using 2 SATA HDs.
When we wanted to install a new client, and inserted a DVD into the PC, 
it behaved like on drugs, showing the following output 
in /var/log/warn:
Feb 28 15:19:30 baum kernel: rtc: lost some interrupts at 256Hz.

After that, the SW RAID stopped it's work, some VMware clients crashed 
and so on. Not a good situation.
I found this in dmesg:
CPU 0: aperture @ b6c6000000 size 32 MB
Aperture from northbridge cpu 0 too small (32 MB)
No AGP bridge found
Your BIOS doesn't leave a aperture memory hole
Please enable the IOMMU option in the BIOS setup
This costs you 64 MB of RAM
Mapping aperture over 65536 KB of RAM @ 8000000
PCI-DMA: Disabling AGP.
PCI-DMA: aperture base @ 8000000 size 65536 KB
PCI-DMA: Reserving 64MB of IOMMU area in the AGP aperture
The problem is, it's an ASUS A8N-E, and doesn't have AGP but PCI-Express 
- and therefore no more BIOS setting for the AGP aperture size.
The kernel set that IOMMU to 64MB, but it still seems to small. There's 
a kernel boot option "iommu=...", but using "iommu=off" lead to a 
frozen system during boot, and "iommu=128M" didn't boot at all.
I found a message from Andi Kleen of SUSE suggesting using 
"iommu=memaper=3", and that helped - at least until now. I just wanted 
to say thank you for that, and document this fact here for others 
possibly running into the same problem.
