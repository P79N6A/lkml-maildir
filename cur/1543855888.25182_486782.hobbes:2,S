Does anyone know what determines the size of a core
dump? I have a process running out of memory (it
allocates about 3GB) - but the size of core varies
(between 2-3GB) depending on how much the process
wrote on the allocated memory.
Also, the time it takes to write the core (same size)
varies??
I briefly looked at elf_core_dump and get_user_pages()
in binfmt_elf.c. Is there any documentation on this?
Or anyone knows how it works?
TIA
