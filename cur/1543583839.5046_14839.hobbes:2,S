I am doing this very thing on linux 2.2.18.  My kernel has both the hd.c and
ide.c drivers installed.
I had to specify ide0=0x1f0 to the kernel to prevent the kernel's hd.c driver
from remapping the first two drives to hda/hdb.  With the ide0 setting the
kernel preserves the true partition mapping.  My boot partition is on
/dev/hde and my root is on /dev/hdg.
Since my UDMA 100 controller is an addon controller I had to instruct my
system's BIOS to specify boot order as ATA/SCSI, and to boot from "SCSI"
rather than HDD0.
