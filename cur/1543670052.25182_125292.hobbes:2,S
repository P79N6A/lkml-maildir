Mmmm. wouldn't that just optimise away the BUG_ONs, but not the BUGs ?
Which will tell you something, but I'm not sure anything interesting.
My impression is that if I do:
if (foo)
	do {} while (0);
the compiler will just ditch the whole thing, and not evaluate foo.
I'll admit to not having checked that, but still ....
