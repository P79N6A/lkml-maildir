Hi,
tried the patch. The problem looks gone, although i've placed
the system under even some more load than before (8.9, maybe not
impressive but first time for this one).
The reiserfsck showed up some nasty looking errors:
 shrink_id_map: objectid map shrinked: used 4096, 5 blocks
 grow_id_map: objectid map expanded: used 5120, 5 blocks
 grow_id_map: objectid map expanded: used 10240, 10 blocks
 bad_leaf: block 211482 has wrong order of items
 ...more of that...
 free block count 1326452 mismatches with a correct one 1326458.
 on-disk bitmap does not match to the correct one. 1 bytes differ
"reiserfsck --rebuild-tree" cured them without visible damages for now.
There were some messages about deleted blocks, expanded objectid map,
shrinked map and one "dir 1 2 has wrong sd_size 120, has to be 152".
I can send you logs, if needed.
Does the 2.5.4-pre2 contains this patch ?
