Yeah, that patch is not actually converting the pfn_valid() users to only
trust VM_IO, it only does a few special cases (notably the follow_pages()  
thing, which wasn't the issue here).
So the patch would have to be expanded to cover _all_ of the page table
following functions. It probably isn't that much, just looking for code
that checks for PageReserved() will pinpoint the needed users pretty well.
So I think the VM_IO approach could fix this, but it would need to be 
fleshed out more. In the meantime, fixing pfn_valid() is definitely the 
right thing to do.
