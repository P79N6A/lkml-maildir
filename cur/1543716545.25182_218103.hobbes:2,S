I seem to recall that this was intentional.  When I first wrote the
code I wanted to leave the splicing code to just splice things, and
when the code that cared about disconnected-ness (in knfsd) discovered
that something really was connected, it would clear the bit
(find_exported_dentry does this). 
However if we want to ensure that there is at-most one disconnected
dentry for an inode, we do need to set the bit more aggressively.
I'll try and review the code with that in mind.  Thanks.

One problem with this is that (in include/asm-i386/atomic.h at least):
  static __inline__ void atomic_inc(atomic_t *v)
atomic_inc returns "void".
