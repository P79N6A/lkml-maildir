You have a terminally buggy piece of shit compiler.
Lookie here:
 - the bug happens on this:
	char c = *p++;
 - which has been compiled into
	8b 3a		mov    (%edx),%edi
   which is a *word* access.
 - the pointer is at the end of a page (very much on purpose):
	edx: f2a3fffe	
 - and as a result you get an exception on the *next* page:
	BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address f2a40000
and btw, there is no question what-so-ever about whether your compiler 
might be doing a legal optimization - the compiler really is wrong, and is 
total shit. You need to make a gcc bug-report. Because this is not a 
question of "the standard is ambiguous", this is a question of "the 
compiler turned good code into code that could SIGSEGV in user space too, 
if 'malloc()' happened to return a pointer at the end of an allocation".
