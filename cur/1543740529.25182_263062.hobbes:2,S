There are at least two ways:
a) Set a new page flag in invalidate, test+clear that at fault time
b) shoot down all pte's mapping the locked page at invalidate time, mark the
   page not uptodate.
The latter is complex but has the advantage of fixing the current
half-assed situation wherein existing mmaps are seeing invalidated data.

We could just remove the BUG in mpage_writepage() (which I assume is the
one which was being hit) but we might still have a not uptodate page with
uptodate buffers and I suspect that the kernel will either go BUG there
instead or will bring the page uptodate again without performing any I/O. 
But I haven't checked that.
