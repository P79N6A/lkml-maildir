No errors reported on either interface.
Interesting results, in one direction though.  It seems highly likely 
the problem is only with the 82545EM as I couldn't get a botched 
transfer FROM it to the 82547EI after 20 or so attempts, (both of these 
are onboard unfortunately so no swapping).  Several transfers TO it did 
yield bad files, though (using my big 1.6G gzipped tarball).
Now, on to the patterns.  I didn't get a _single_ failure in either 
directions using what that code snippet generated in over 20 attempts. 
Perhaps we're failing on larger amounts of more complex data?
