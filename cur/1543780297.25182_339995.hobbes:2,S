You do that (size * LDT_ENTRY_SIZE / PAGE_SIZE) operation an awfully
large number of times.  Could you consider introducing a little helper,
say ldt_size_pages()?  
Or, could you have a helper like make_ldt_readonly()?  You don't have to
export it, just use it in that one file.

Could you please explain what this is for?  It doesn't appear to be part
of the abstraction.  
Every call path I can see to init_new_context() is immediately preceded
by mm_alloc(), which memsets the entire mm.  The context is a direct
member of mm_struct, and should be zeroed along with the mm_alloc()
memset.  So, this seems a bit superfluous.
In any future patches that you might post, please do one thing per
patch, it makes them much easier to audit.
