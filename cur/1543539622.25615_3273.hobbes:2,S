Yep.

Agreed.  The key being that it is implemented properly, and that
proper security guru's were involved in the process, not some MS
Visual Basic programmer.

The fear being that a fair number of companies would likely
downplay the security issue and take a cut corner approach, or
mis-implement something that THEY thought was secure, but which
was not.
I get a laugh for example from the console game systems.  Every
one that comes out claims that their games can not be cracked
because of some new super crypto thing.  3 days later some hacker
has cracked it and exposed all details...  ;o)

Exactly. That is the only way IMHO.

Sory, what I meant by "filter" is that the drive "filters" the
update sent to it by ensureing it is a true update via encrypted
sig or whatnot.  If the sig doesn't match, the drive filters it
to the go away pile.

Sorry, my choice of the word "filter" was bad, its not what I
meant.
