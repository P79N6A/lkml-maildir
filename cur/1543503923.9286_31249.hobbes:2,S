I've got a high traffic shell machine and with 2.2.10 virutal memory usage
is very odd.  It grows at about 5 megs an hour until it uses all swap
space, the odd part about it is that there is no process that is useing the
swap sapce.  It looks as if there is a leak someplace but I can't find it.
Has anyone seen this happen?  This is happening on an (21164) Alpha.
