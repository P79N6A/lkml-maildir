Oh well... i've though about it too, and decided that I was not ready to
try it. For one, the problem you mention, with the pile of embedded
junk. I made the design decision to define an OF client interface as the
standard & mandatory entry mecanism to the ppc64 kernel (except legacy
iSeries of course, but I don't want that to multiply). That or the
kexec-like entrypoint passing a flattened device-tree in.
Also, there are other significant differences in other areas. At this
point, I think the differences are  bigger than the common code.
What would be interesting would be to proceed incrementally, having a
directory somewhere to put the "common" ppc/ppc64 code, and slowly
moving things there.
Ben.
