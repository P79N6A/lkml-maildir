Hi,
in [1] Linus states that CONFIG_PARAVIRT implies usage of inferior locks.
Looking at the code, I wonder whether are we in fact really using byte 
locks in CONFIG_PARAVIRT situation? Where are we actually setting 
pv_lock_ops.spin_lock pointer to point to __byte_spin_lock?
Such initialization seems to happen only in paravirt_use_bytelocks()
function, but my blind eyes prevent me from finding a callsite from which
this function would eventually get called.
It seems to me that paravirt_use_bytelocks() is a dead code that gets 
never called, and the same applies to the implementations of write locks. 
What did I miss?
