In an earlier post to the list I described a hard lockup condition
that occurs on linux kernels 2.4.22, 2.6.13, and 2.6.17 when using
a 4 port 10/100 fast ethernet card.  The lockup is easily repeatable
and occurs on 2 out of 3 computers.
Further testing has revealed that the lockup can be prevented on all
computers by making sure the card is installed on the primary PCI bus.
If the card is installed in a slot on the secondary PCI bus (behind a
PCI to PCI bridge) the lockup occurs.
Are there any PCI tuning registers that I can tweak to get around
this problem?  Any changes I could make to the e100 driver to fix this?
Any help appreciated.
Regards,
Wm
