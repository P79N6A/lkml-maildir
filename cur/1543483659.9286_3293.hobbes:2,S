the aha1542 and NCR53c8xx drivers seem to be 'buggy' in 2.2.1 - they
worked fine on identical hardware in 2.2.0pre9, but now these drivers will
only intermittently recognize certain devices attached (device setup is
fine, works great in 2.0.x, 2.1.x, 2.2.0pre9). .... and cdrecord won't
work at all...
also, the DEC nic drivers are incorrectly reporting stats in /proc/net/dev
(ie, every packet reported as an error packet, but performance is OK).
This was not present in 2.2.0pre9.
What happened?  Or do I need a '-DDONT_BREAK_DRIVERS' in the Makefile
somewhere? :)
