Like your SLAB adventures. I thought it was a bit bizzare that it was
made fully preemptable and it any time you get another developer able
to hammer on this, like you, is alway an encouraging sign for the rest
of us on this project. :)
Unfortunately, jackd is only one program and what's needed is a broader
set of apps that can push the system much harder, along with jackd, to
see where things blow up. SMP is a likely trigger for all of this stuff.
In particular, shared-exclusive lock semantics under high contention
situations, vma access, etc... We'll see.
