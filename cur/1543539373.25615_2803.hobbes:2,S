During installing Linux the first time from RH CD, I select "Everything"
from the option.  But a lot of HD space will be occupied.  What I need to
know is the package list essential to be installed at the beginning for the
use of future installing A NEW LINUX KERNEL and/or other applications.
I am sorry not having the forgoing explained clear in my previous posting.
Thanks
Stephen
