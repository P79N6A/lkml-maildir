Recent 2.5 kernels will crash with a null pointer dereference on my
powerbook (PowerPC laptop) when I try to suspend.  I tracked it down
to cardbus_suspend() in drivers/pcmcia/pci-socket.c calling
pcmcia_suspend_socket() with a NULL argument.  It turns out that
socket->pcmcia_socket is never set in the current code.
This changeset seems to be the culprit:
ChangeSet 1.1017 2003/02/15 12:42:51 linux@brodo.de
  [PATCH] pcmcia: use device_class->add_device/remove_device
  This patch removes the {un}register_ss_entry/pcmcia_{un}register_socket
  calls, and replaces them with generic driver-model-compatible functions.
  
  Also, update the CodingStyle of these cs.c functions to what's recommended
  in the Linux kernel.
Paul.
