Hi all,
 Is it possible to force an assembly instruction to execute
on a specific CPU in a userspace app ?
If not, I guess it'll have to be done using an insertable kernel
module with a routine such as..
	for number_of_CPUs {
		scheduling magic to switch to desired CPU
		instruction
	}
Any pointers on how to write the scheduling part ?
regards,
Dave.
