I won't try to say anything about III, but I is not really suitable,
it breaks code currently using capabilities.  Or at least makes them
less secure.  With sub-capabilities the interface diverges from the
POSIX capabilities interfaces, but at least one can keep backward
compatibilities.
An alternative would be to keep the existing capabilities, and add new
ones for all the cases which need splitting.  If the old value is
set/reset, all the split-out values are "magically" affected as well. 
This would help keeping the interfaces in line with POSIX and no
additions to the userlevel libcap would be needed.  Yes, new cap[gs]et
syscalls would be needed, but this fact is hidden from the user.
