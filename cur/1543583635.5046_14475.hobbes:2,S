Good day, all,
	Sorry for the offtopic post; I sincerely believe this will be
useful to developers with multiple copies of, say, the linux kernel tree
on their drives.  I'll be brief.  Please followup to private mail -
thanks.
	Freedups scans the directories you give it for identical files and
hardlinks them together to save drive space.  Please see
ftp://ftp.stearns.org/pub/freedups
 .  V0.2.1 is up there; it has received
some testing, but may yet contain bugs.
	I was able to recover ~676M by running it against 8 different
2.4.x kernel trees with different patches that originally contained ~948M
of files.  YMMV.
	I do understand there are better ways to handle this problem (cp
-av --link, cvs? Bitkeeper, deleting unneeded trees, tarring up trees,
etc.).  See the readme for a little discussion on this.  This is just one
approach that may be useful in some situations.
	Cheers,
	- Bill
