Agreed. The dangling _s is a redundant carry over from an earlier
version of the patch. It was there as I had used same name cstate_entry
for a variable and I wanted to make sure differentiate the structure and
variable and not to inadvarently misuse them. It can be safely removed
now.

Agreed again. Infact, just '{}' will do as well.. As both the issues are
coding style/cosmetic kind I will hold onto sending a updates until the
patch goes mainline. Will send changes through trivial list at that
time.
Thanks for reviewing.
