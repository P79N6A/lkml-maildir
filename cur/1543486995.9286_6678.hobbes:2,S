There are already separate lists for license issues and
far-off discussions regarding the future of the Linux
kernel, as well as a kernel documentation bug.
Now there's a new list for the discussion of new and
still alpha-quality patches.

I agree that would be wrong.

Hmm, what do you think we could do to reduce the traffic
on linux-kernel?  The way it is now it's so busy that it
actually hampers the debugging of the kernel and helping
people with problems.
It is clear that something has to be done in order to
avoid this list becoming so clogged up that nobody can
keep up anymore.  If it were 'only' 2k messages/month,
I think a lot more people would be able to keep an eye
on the list, thus avoiding the repetetive FAQing when
a new bug is released...
