I was under the impression that a file handle would be returned.
I'm not so sure that is a sane way to handle hot-plug though.
First of all, in general, it's going to be like this:

Those who care might best be served by SIGBUS with si_code
and si_info set appropriately. Perhaps a revoke() syscall
that handled mmap() would work the same way.
