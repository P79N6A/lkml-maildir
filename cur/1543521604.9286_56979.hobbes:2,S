Well, you've got all the time in the world then.  Well, at least
20 years...  (hint - look at the date on your message)

2.0.0
I believe all arch's support SMP that have SMP hardware avail, or
close to all.

Much faster SMP with finer grained locks rather than a global
kernel lock.

I can't help you there.  SMP is strewn throughout the kernel I
believe, and is not in one place.

I believe even much more finer grained locks, allowing for
multiple processors to be doing more stuff simultaneously rather
than waiting for a lock to become freed.

Again - can't help you there.

I believe from what I've read that 2.3.x is getting very very
very good and that NT had better watch out.  ;o)
No comment on BSD as it would just start a flamewar.  ;o)
