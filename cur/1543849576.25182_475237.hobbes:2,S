OK, a pattern.

I will find a common header. kernel.h probably.

I very much ask to do both.
I want build system, compiler, headers etc to do everything against
compiling buggy code. Similar to dropping rogue packets, you drop them
at the first firewall, even if your central box runs OpenBSD with all
ports closed.
In most cases it is impossible, in some cases it's cheap and simple.
So far the tower of usefullness is
	a) compiler refuses to compile
	b) linker refuses to link
	c) compiler spits warning
	d) sparse spits (endian) warning
a) is paragon of escalation.
b) is close: developer patches code, test-compile _just_one_ file and happily
   send patch. Maintatiner gets patch, does allmodconfig before sending to
   Linus, swears, fixes.
c) is also very visible, except GCC 4 doing strong as default compiler in
   distros, deprecation and must check threats; folks also drink coffee while
   Linux compiles. IIRC, there was seriously looking bug because of missed
   header => missed prototype => missed warning
			      => compiler pushes junk to stack
d) is OK, except number of people runnning sparse is orders of magnitude
   smaller that number of people compiling, consequently noticed by
   sparse bugs stay longer in tree. Add non-x86 and endian warnings not
   being default to the picture.
Enough words. The closer to a) you are, the better. There is cheap and
simple way to be there.
> If it spits a warning then it'll get fixed soon enough.
:^) You apply patch to -mm and start waiting on how soon someone will fix
gregkh-driver-nozomi.patch so it wouldn't do
	u32 flags;
but
	unsigned long flags;
everywhere.
