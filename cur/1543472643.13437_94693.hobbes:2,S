So what? That just tells you that you don't know everything:  A lot of people
could show you how it is done reliably with of the shelf hardware and software.

No it is not, ever heard of OS/400? 
And in addition a filesystem can not do all the things databases would like
it to do unless the filesystem was specially tailored for the specific
database APPLICATION.
RAW DEVICES are simply a short cut of the system to allow databases to use
"filesystems" specially tailored for the specific application (the on site
application, not the database as distributed by the vendor). Not more and not
less.  So why don't they use the VFS API provided by most (but not all!)
systems? Simple: because this makes the database system-dependant and
unnecessary complex. And complexity kills software.
Above you were stating that special filesystems would be the solutions
to the problem. They are and the only system independant way to do this are
raw devices.
