Jens, should sg_next ever return the sg containing the chain link?
If sg points at the entry right before the link entry, don't we
want to skip it?
E.g.:
static inline struct scatterlist *sg_next(struct scatterlist *sg)
{
	struct scatterlist *next;
	/* just in case, shouldn't really ever be here */
	if (sg_is_chain(sg))
		return sg_chain_ptr(sg);
	next = sg + 1;
	if (sg_is_chain(next))
		return sg_chain_ptr(next);
	return next;
}
