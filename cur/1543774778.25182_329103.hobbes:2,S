Hi,
Vojtech, thanks for the great description.

Hmm, but isn't that exactly the kind of data that is printed by the
ibm_acpi kernel module in "/proc/acpi/ibm/ecdump" then?
According to the README "this feature dumps the values of 256 embedded
controller registers." So shouldn't the reading of the accelerometers
be included in these values as well?
Or could this mean that the embedded controller might have more than
these 256 registers that could be read out? Or does it need to be "told"
to poll the accelerometer for these values repeatedly?
Many register values in there change automatically (e.g. fan speed), but
so far we have not seen a pattern of register value changes that look
like they are related to acceleration of the laptop in any direction.
Bye,
	LenZ
