Doesn't cut it: It is _exactly_ what capabilities are designed to avoid.
You can get (some) backwards compatibility by setting capabilities
adequately.

Unless you cleanly separate UID/GID from capabilities, and place that under
the direct control of the kernel (i.e., into the filesystem) all you get is
an ugly hybrid with old and new problems.

Why can't it be done in this proposal? Binding to a low port is a
capability (or should be made one, as it is one of the special powers root
enjoys right now).
