Hello,
I work for a small company involved in broadcast.
For the past year, we've been looking for a PCI board that meets
at least the following requirements:
1. Serial Digital Interface input
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Digital_Interface
2. On-board (hardware) MPEG-2 encoder (our app runs on a low-spec PC) 
which returns a smooth CBR Transport Stream
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_stream
3. Robust Linux 2.6 device driver
AFAIU, the major player in this space is Optibase's MovieMaker 230 
Publisher. AFAICT, they only support 2.4 kernels, and the board is 
overpriced.
I had hoped that Greg Kroah-Hartman's offer would change the landscape, 
but I don't think it has.
At this point, I am definitely open to any and all comments, 
suggestions, and ideas.
Regards.
