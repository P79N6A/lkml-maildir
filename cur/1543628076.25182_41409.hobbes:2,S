Hi,
reading through my dmesg output I found the following:
--
hda: drive_cmd: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hda: drive_cmd: error=0x04 { DriveStatusError }
hdc: drive_cmd: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hdc: drive_cmd: error=0x04 { DriveStatusError }
--
This is the first time I see this error for my HD's.
HD information from dmesg:
--
Uniform Multi-Platform E-IDE driver ver.:7.0.0
ide: system bus speed 33MHz
hda: QUANTUM FIREBALL640A, ATA DISK drive
hdc: QUANTUM FIREBALL640A, ATA DISK drive

I changed nothing in my .config from earlier -dj kernels
So what can be wrong?
There is also some other problem with kernels 2.5 for my system
since every kernel I have tried locked up after one of the HD's
(mostly hdc) had lost its interrupt, sometimes after an hour,
sometimes after almost a week... keeping the hdc1 (/usr) partition
mounted ro increased the lifetime of the running system.
Is this a problem of my (old) hardware giving up on me or is the
new IDE driver not fully capable of handling my hardware?
It also appeared that the -dj kernels were better then the normal
kernels.
If you want more information please ask,
Rudmer
