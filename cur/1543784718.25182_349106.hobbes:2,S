It's not a solution if it doesn't /work/. If you think this works for
anyone who likes devfs, you clearly still don't understand what said
people like about devfs in the first place.

What version of alsa libraries are you using that can deal with the
device nodes in the root of /dev? I'm grepping the latest source code
right now and I don't see it. Or is this yet another one of those facts
you just made up? In what sense can alsa be said to work if zero alsa
programs work?

You can use ndevfs, if you don't care about your device nodes working.
However that kind of defeats the purpose. To have a /working/ devfs-like
solution you need the names, and currently the only way to get those is
the devfs hooks.
Nobody is obligating you to provide a working ndevfs, but don't claim
it's a solution when it's not. A devfs-like solution whose device nodes
have random names which break programs is copying the form of devfs
(exporting nodes from kernel space) and ignoring the point of devfs.
