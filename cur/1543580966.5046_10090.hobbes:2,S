ciped is great for this.  I use it to tunnel ssh from my home dialup
to work.  Very stable, and with cipe's shared keys, there's nothing
too taxing about setting it up.
I just have a call to /etc/init.d/ciped restart in my ppp up script.
freeswan was another way I looked at , but ip/sec was horrible at
the time and didn't (maybe still doesn't) deal with dynamic ip
assignment nicely.
Cheers,
Mark
