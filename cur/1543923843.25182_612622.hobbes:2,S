The real problem here is that ip_compute_csum is part of lib-y, but is also
exported for modules.  This problem has come up before, for instance your
patch for csum_partial()
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/3/209
Or the problem with kasprintf and the lg module:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/24/15
The general lib-y vs EXPORT_SYMBOL problem:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/25/17
The only reason the net stuff works, is because CONFIG_NET includes igmp.c,
which can't be compiled as a module.  That means ip_compute_csum() will get
pulled out of the lib.a file for igmp, and thus be present for the net modules
that use it too.  If igmp could be turned off, made a module, or stopped using
ip_compute_csum(), then the users of ip_compute_csum() that do depend on
CONFIG_NET would have the same problem as bttv does.
It seems a shame to create a new ip checksum function in the bttv driver when
a perfectly good one already exists and will already be present in just about
every kernel out there.  Honestly, how common is NET=n and VIDEO_BT848=m
outside of randconfig?
