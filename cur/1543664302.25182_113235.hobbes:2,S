Well, if that's all you're asking for, it's easy - I don't know if
you'll agree that the syntax is sane, but it's there.  From the GCC 3.3
manual:
`may_alias'
     Accesses to objects with types with this attribute are not
     subjected to type-based alias analysis, but are instead assumed to
     be able to alias any other type of objects, just like the `char'
     type.  See `-fstrict-aliasing' for more information on aliasing
     issues.
     Example of use:
          typedef short __attribute__((__may_alias__)) short_a;
          int
          main (void)
          { 
            int a = 0x12345678;
            short_a *b = (short_a *) &a;
            b[1] = 0;
            if (a == 0x12345678)
              abort();
            exit(0);
          }
     If you replaced `short_a' with `short' in the variable
     declaration, the above program would abort when compiled with
     `-fstrict-aliasing', which is on by default at `-O2' or above in
     recent GCC versions.
So you define a typedef for unsigned long which has the __may_alias__
attribute, and you go to town writing memcpy inline with that type
instead of a normal unsigned long.
