Question; is de read-ahead of the rz1000 chipset (on p90 plato
mobo's) the same as the read-ahead you can swith on with hdparm
-A1? Or is the last one for the harddisk itself? (-> that it is
reading ahead in its own internal buffers or something)
If it's not for the harddisk, but specifically for the chipset;
I might have solved the fs corruption I saw with 2.2.12 on my
P90 :-)
