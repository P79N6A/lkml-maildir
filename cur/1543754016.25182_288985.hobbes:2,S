I went for the simplest and safest fix first as this is a data
corruption problem and I want assurance that this fixes device-mapper
striping.
I didn't want to change it to do_div() without first checking
it would not slow down the code on the main architectures: on the contrary
I would hope that use of an optimised library inline speeds it up, but 
want to be sure.  You don't need the 64-bit mod until you have hundreds
of TB in a single logical volume block device, filesystem...
So far, I've only seen two test reports, both of which say they
are still seeing data corruption in a filesystem on top of dm-stripe
after applying this patch.  But none of this information so far
is specific enough to say whether the remaining problem(s) is/are
in device-mapper.
