The FreeBSD folks have a whole host of benchmark results (MySQL,
PostgreSQL, BIND, NSD, ebizzy, SPECjbb, etc.) located at
http://people.freebsd.org/~kris/scaling/
 that demonstrate that the
2.6.23+ scheduler is worse than the 2.6.22 scheduler and both are worse
than FreeBSD 7.
The interesting thing is that they've been running these tests
constantly for years now to demonstrate that their new scheduler hasn't
regressed compared to their old scheduler and as a benchmark against the
competition (i.e. Linux).
Does anybody even do this at all for Linux?
(Also, ignoring MySQL because it's a terrible piece of software at least
when regarding it's scalability is a bad idea. It's the M in LAMP, it
has a huge user base, and FreeBSD manages to outperform Linux with the
same unscalable piece of software.)
