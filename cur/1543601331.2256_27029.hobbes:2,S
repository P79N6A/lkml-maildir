Hi everyone,
just a short question (probably a still unknown bug, I didn't find
anything about this): 
 My Box: a AdvanSys SCSI Low Cost Controller
         a TEAC CDR 55S CD-Burner connected to it
			a new motherboard (Asus) with ACPI, without APM support
now, when i enable ACPI Processor support (nothing else) and i try to
mount a CD, the computer crashes sometimes, but if it doesn't crash on
mounting, it crashes later while accessing the CD. The Display goes
black and the computer doesn't make a move anymore. The software power
switch doesn't work any longer. 
I guess, that this is a bug in the kernel, for the CD works when i
disable the ACPI support and for i never had any problems under *BSD.
But I wasn't able to track the problem down in the source. 
Anyone any ideas?
Thanks
Holger
