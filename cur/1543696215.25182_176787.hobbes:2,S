But then it is a bug: In menuconfig nothing is activated or please tell 
me how through the menu it is possible to set this to "no". The beauty 
is: I tested mm1 again, and yes, NO problems. I even threw out the 
forcedeth driver of mm2 just to have identical config and it doesn't 
make a change (still mouse stuttering). Further more mm1's .config had a 
CONFIG_SCSI=y as well, but no probs, so somewhere is a bug...
