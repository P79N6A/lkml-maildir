For what it's worth (I know: not much), I like the named asserts in
Reiser4/Reiserfs.  Although I haven't been bitten by any BUGs yet (maybe
I'm just lucky), whenever I see these on the mailing list, it gives the
impression that the users are interacting more directly with the
developers, and it helps us to get to know the developers better.
If people really want more standard-looking identifiers, I think Namesys
should keep the names and make a hybrid identifier, like
"nikita-123(<file>:<line>)"
