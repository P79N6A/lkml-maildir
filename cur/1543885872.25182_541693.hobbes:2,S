Basically I prefer be64 over __be64 for similar reasons that most people
prefer u64 over __u64.  Others prefer uint64_t over both, but C99 hasn't
defined beint64_t yet.
Maybe I should secretly patch include/linux/types.h to add these three
lines and bribe akpm's evil twin to merge that?  It definitely makes
more sense to have such a typedef in generic code or not at all.
