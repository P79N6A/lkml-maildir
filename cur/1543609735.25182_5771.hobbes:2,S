Ouch. I used Mandrake 8.0... It seems my hda 6 os overlapping my hda4.
If I delete my extended partition, restart to windows and use dos fdisk
to create a new d:, there is the risk of this d: overwriting something
more important than my evolution install. I'm going to try this anyway.
I can always set up a swap *file* instead.
Partition table:
