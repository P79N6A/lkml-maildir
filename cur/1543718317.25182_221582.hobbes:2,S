Ok, the story is ... fbdevs do have optional accel hooks for copyarea,
rectfill, and imageblit. However, the current fbcon console subsystem
doesn't properly adapt it's drawing techniques based on the accel
capabilities (blit + redraw is more efficient for example when you have
a fast accelerated copyarea, while full redraw is better in other cases,
etc...)
This patch adds "hints" provided by the fbdev to inform fbcon what are
its accel capabilities.
