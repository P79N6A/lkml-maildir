It's a problem caused by the design in the Linux kernel and not a problem of
libscg or cdrecord. 
The point is that Linux constantly invents new ugly and unneeded things and
after I found a workaround, people try to prevent the workaround from
being usable. 
In 1998, I did send a patch against the sg.c driver that introduced
everything that is needed for Generic SCSI transport. I am still waiting 
for even the needed features to appear........
