I do not.  The command line, through grub after the kernel spec is, ro 
root=/dev/hda5 hdc=ide-scsi
By the way I thought of some more information that may, or may not, 
matter in this case.  This is all based on RH90, upgraded based on the 
Documentation/Changes file of course, and I'm using gcc version  3.2.2 
200330222 (Red Hat Linux 3.2.2-5).
Thanks for the response,
Gary
