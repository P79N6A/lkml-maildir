MMF basically means the "Transaction Translating" (TT) Hub had data
for the host, but the host didn't collect it in time ... so that some
data was lost.  In this context, it's only for periodic transfers,
meaning interrupt (for HID keyboards, mice, etc) or isochronous (mostly
audio or video, but sometimes ATM).
Unfortunately, that's the type of fault that's especially hard to
recover from.  Plus, very few of the upper layer drivers have even
a minor clue about fault recovery strategies during I/O ... it's not
supposed to happen for interrupt transfers, one hopes the drivers
will at least die gracefully.   With ISO, faults are expected (since
it's "best effort" delivery, time-priority).
On the plus side, MMF errors have been vanishingly rare until this
cpufreq interaction came up ... which of course implies the downside
that those "handle the result" code paths are all but untested.

There could be such problems, yes.  But in practice, I don't know
that we've ever seen them.
(There's a first time for everthing, yes.  I *just* fetched a webpage
where an image got overwritten about half way through fetching it.
Top half was today's, bottom half was tomorrow's, update 12 midnight EST.
Strangest looking JPG ever!  ;)

That's pretty much how I feel about VIA's USB stuff:
buggy crap that I actively steer people away from.
And that's why it doesn't seem odd to me to add even
more workarounds for VIA-only bugs.

I don't think we always have the option not to cope with
broken hardware.  We may have some options about *how* we
cope with it though ...

Well, see above about why retrying wouldn't work well.  Data lost, and
not recoverable ... although if the events are only USB keyboards/mice,
then the user might be able to recover.  (Stuart?)
Alternatively, if Broadcom then just veto cpufreq changes whenever
there are USB interrupt transfers active.  (We *can* veto changes
in notifiers, yes?)
