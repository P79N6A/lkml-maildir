FWIW, Updating the BIOS on my Tyan Tiger MP did sort out some (I *think* APIC
related) problems I had with a PCI ethernet card under 2.4.18. I agree with
your `if it ain't broke don't fix it' approach in general, but in this case
updating the BIOS fixed for me a problem that I had not attributed to it!
