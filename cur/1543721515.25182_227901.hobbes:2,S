So your conclusion is that data=journal mode is useless if you do not
want a correct mtime?
It would be a littles sense in developing the data=journal mode if this
is the only benefit, don't you think?
>From the Linux/Documentation/filesystems/ext3.txt
data=journal            All data are committed into the journal prior
                        to being written into the main file system.
data=ordered    (*)     All data are forced directly out to the main
file                    system prior to its metadata being committed to
                        the journal.
My problem is that ext3 in the latest kernel, 2.6.x and the latest
2.4.x, are not well documented around the web. Whitepapers and so are
pretty old. Much have changed I belive in ext3 since it was first
introduced by Dr. Tweedie. The first release was journaling both data
and metadata, se also the transcript from Dr. Tweedie from the Ottawa
Linux Symposium 20th July 2000.
http://olstrans.sourceforge.net/release/OLS2000-ext3/OLS2000-ext3.html
There he says that they are journaling both metadata and data, but that
the design goal is not to do that. So can this be interpreted that mode
data=journal is only there for historic reasons?

I would belive that the goal for such a mode data=journal would gain
extra data integrity because it also journals data. Why should it not? I
would belive that it makes sense to have these different modes so people
can choose the best mode for there applications.

Are you sure?
