Of course that means that it's not really type-safe, since it has no way 
to check whether the object is embedded in the right type of struct, right 
;) (But I think that's okay, C doesn't have provisions for real 
inheritance)

Have you considered just putting in the embedded part via some macro - 
I think that's what NTFS does for compilers which don't support unnamed 
structs.
Basically
#define EMB_ATTRIBUTE \
	int emb1;
	int emb2
struct my_attribute {
	EMB_ATTRIBUTE
	int my1;
	int my2;
};
That'll work with named initializers just fine, so the users don't have to 
deal with ugly DEVICE_ATTR macros, where one forgets if parameter #3 was 
show or store ;) - It follows the common way of hiding away unavoidable 
ugliness in some header.

Why would stringify (include/linux/stringify.h) not work? However, Al Viro 
may get mad at you for generating ungreppable symbols either way ;-)
