Simple answer, don't wait in tx_timeout :)
These days drivers often need quite a while for hardware reset.  I am 
pushing to move this code, long term, into process context.  So, in 
tx_timeout:
* disable NIC and interrupts as best you can, quickly
* schedule_task/schedule_work to schedule the full hardware reset
