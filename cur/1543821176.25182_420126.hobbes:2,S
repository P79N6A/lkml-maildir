No sudo.
Besides, the next command after make modules_install is mount.
Besides, if it weren't the fact that the tarball has world-writable files, this
would be more secure than compiling as a normal user. Instead of just
hijacking some user account, they now have to do that followed by
somehow getting my root password.
I disallowed password authentication for root over ssh some time ago.
