Alan,
The following is submitted based on your comment.
I was intrigued by your proposal for a binary license, so I
discussed it with my business associates.
We offer to kernel.org the sum of $50,000.00 US for a one time
license to the Linux Kernel Source for a single snapshot of
a single Linux version by release number.  This offer must be
accepted by **ALL** copyright holders and this snapshot will
subsequently convert the GPL license into a BSD style license
for the code.  In other words, what we are asking for is the ability
to snapshot kernel.org at 50K a pop for a license to each
2.<even number> release, then take any even number release
private.  This allows all changes to a 2.<even number>
release to be used for a particular release per license without
returning changes.  This money will be made payable to kernel.org
and must be accepted by everyone. 
If you think this is a good idea, we are prepared to actually
execute on this proposal.  This is for real, and let me know
who to make the check out to. 
Please advise.
Jeff
