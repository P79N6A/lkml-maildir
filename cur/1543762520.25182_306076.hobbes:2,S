I think it again varies, and the driver would have to decide what to
do if it can not resume hardware. Take for example USB - i believe USB
guys are shooting at being able to disconnect device while the box is
suspended and have it removed from the system when resuming. In
Probably every driver that has even a slighest notion of
hot-pluggability should just properly clean up after itself and not
signal error to the core.

It is not suspend/freeze here that gets us but resume and with resume
the driver (at least for now) does not have any idea if it is
"unfreeze" or "full-resume". I mean I could have serio just ignore
"unfreeze" requests (as I doubt anyone would ever try to suspend over
PS/2 port ;) ) but I think it should be really handled by the core.
