If that problem has been fixed, this would imply that SKAS should
work on x86-64... or not? Well, I remember that problem being on IA32
emulation and IA32 wasn't included in the patch (for what I can see).
Can you ask more information about this? Also, could you verify if at
least with noprocmm and a host SKAS-V9 it works? Two things are to
check:
* Uml64 should use /proc/mm64 (unimplemented)
* Uml64 should use the right version of PTRACE_FAULTINFO (I don't
remember what I did, if I introduced PTRACE_EX_FAULTINFO or if I
directly added the missing trap_no field in PTRACE_FAULTINFO; please
verify).
I won't have the time to check this at least until the 22 June.
Bye
