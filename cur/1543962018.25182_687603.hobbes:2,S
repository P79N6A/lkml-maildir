We don't need to.

To be exact, we control what we merge and when.  There's no rule saying that
every patch has to be merged as soon as it appears to be ready for merging,
or during the nearest merge window, AFAICS.

This was an argument agaist starting a separate development branch in analogy
with 2.5, IIRC, and I agree with that.
Still, I think we don't need to merge patches at the current rate and it might
help improve their overall quality if we didn't.  Of course, the latter is only
a speculation, although it's based on my experience.
