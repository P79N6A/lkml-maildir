Not according to my close(2) man page:
       A successful close does not guarantee that  the  data  has
       been  successfully  saved  to  disk,  as the kernel defers
       writes. It is not common for a  filesystem  to  flush  the
       buffers  when the stream is closed. If you need to be sure
       that the data is physically stored use fsync(2).  (It will
       depend on the disk hardware at this point.)
Note that this means writing a truly reliable shell or Perl script is
tricky.  I suppose you can "use POSIX qw(fsync);" in Perl.  But what
do you do for a shell script?  /bin/sync :-) ?

Hm.  Does BSD with soft updates guarantee anything about write
ordering on fsync()?  In particular, does it promise to commit the
data before the metadata?

Without marking completion, there is no safe bet.  Without calling
fsync(), you *never* know when the data will hit the disk.  It is very
hard to build a reliable system that way...  For an MTA, for example,
you can never safely inform the remote mailer that you have accepted
the message.  But this problem goes beyond MTAs; very few applications
live in a vacuum.
Reliable systems are tricky.  I guess this is why Oracle and Sybase
make all that money.
