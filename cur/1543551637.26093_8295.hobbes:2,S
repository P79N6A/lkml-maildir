I'm seeing a similar problem with the Xircom Realport card
which uses the 'xircom_tulip_cb' driver.
Workaround: 
Putting the card into promiscuous mode seems to get it going again.
If feels like (but I haven't investigated further) the ARP table isn't
being updated properly.
This was discovered by finding that running 'tcpdump' on the interface
make it work again.

I (was) using 2.2.17 - which had problems you mentioned (different module).
2.4.0-test9 has the same problem.
