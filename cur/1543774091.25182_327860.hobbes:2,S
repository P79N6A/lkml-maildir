Yes it does.  On one processor, it goes down, but goes up on another.
So I'm not sure if I completely understand the behavior.
			vmalloc'ed	__get_free_pages
3.0GHz Xeon, 8MB	6.46ms	 7.05ms
3.4GHz Xeon, 2MB	0.93ms	 1.22ms
1.6GHz ia64, 9MB	9.72ms	10.06ms
What I'm really after though is to have the parameter close to an
experimentally determined optimal value.  So either algorithm with
__get_free_pages appears to be closer.

Yes, it is based on my favorite "industry standard transaction processing
database" bench (I probably should use a shorter name like OLTP).
