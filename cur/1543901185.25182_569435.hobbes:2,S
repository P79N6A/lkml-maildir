To be more clear, your solution is incorrect unless the pci_dev_put() 
occurs after the last reference to hw.{elsa,diva,hfc,njet,...}.dev, 
which is where the HiSax ISDN drivers store their reference to struct 
pci_dev during the runtime life of the PCI device.
Am I missing where your patch does this?
By way of further interest, a few hours _before_ (yes, really) I saw 
your patches, I resumed converting the ISDN HiSax PCI drivers to use the 
PCI driver API.  You can find this work in 
git://git.kernel.org/.../jgarzik/misc-2.6.git#isdn-pci.
If you fix your patches' lifetime problems, I will ACK them myself, 
since my effort is a spare time effort.  But just wanted you to be aware 
that I am deep into the code you are fixing, and can at least speak 
somewhat knowledgeably on the specific lines of code you are changing.
