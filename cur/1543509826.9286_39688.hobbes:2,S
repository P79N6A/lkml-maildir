Subject: SysKonnect driver broken in new kernels?

I have been trying to get the SysKonnect token ring driver
(drivers/net[/tokenring]/sktr.c) to work on an equivelent PCI board.  
Firstly, sktr_wait() doesn't do its job very well.  For one, it hangs for
a practically infinite time period no matter what value its given (so
practically infinite that I have yet to see it stop waiting).  Gutting
that function and replacing it with a udelay() gets the card started.  I
suppose this function use to work as specified, but I don't know how many
kernel versions ago that was.  sktr_wait() does not work in 2.2.13pre9 or
2.3.16.  
After that, it can ifconfig, recieve, and transmit just fine; it just
doesn't know it.  For recieve, the counters increase, and the driver
copies the data into the skb and calls netif_rx().  After that, it gets
lost.  I haven't analysed transmits yet, but looking at 'tcpdump -i tr0'
shows the transmission working just fine, and even shows the response from
the other end (pings).  But again, the recieved frame gets lost after
netif_rx().
Any suggestions?  Kernels 2.3.16 and 2.2.13pre9 tried.  I don't know when
the syskonnect driver stopped working release-wise.
