I'd like to hear back on if suspend/resume works with it, as that is one 
of the areas I couldn't test.  The patch set is completely incremental, 
so we could merge the bits of it in a couple of steps.  The mb() in 
smpboot.c is an important bug fix and should be considered for immediate 
inclusion.
