Hello.
When I'm loading modules for my GUS PnP card, I get "No PnP cards found! Trying
standard ones..." message from the ad1848 module. Can you tell me if this is
an error or correct behaviour?
Do I have to give the ad1848 module some parameters? It has io, irq, dma and
dma2 parameters.
I also don't know which pnp driver/tool use to initialize the card. When I use
isapnp tools (and set io=0x220 irq=11,12 dma=5,7) and then read /proc/isapnp, I
get really WEIRD output. I'm using lates 1.26 version of isapnp tools.
Card 1 'GRV0001:Advanced Gravis InterWave Audio' PnP version 1.0 Product version 1.0
  Logical device 0 'GRV0000:Synth & Codec'
    Supported registers 0x2
    Device is active
    Active port 0xffff,0xffff,0xffff,0xffff,0xffff,0xffff,0xffff,0xffff
    Active IRQ 255 [0xff],255 [0xff]
    Active DMA 255,255
    Active memory 0xffffffff,0xffffffff,0xffffffff,0xffffffff
When I set the values using cat > /proc/isapnp (as described in
Documentation/isapnp.txt) and then cat /proc/isapnp, the values are correct.
That means one of (or both ;-) ) either isa-pnp module or isapnp tools ISN'T
ABLE to setup the PnP card. Can you tell me which one is the bad working?
Thanx
