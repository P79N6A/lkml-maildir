Per kevent fd.
I have some ideas about better mmap ring implementation, which would
dinamically grow it's buffer when events are added and reuse the same
place for next events, but there are some nitpics unresolved yet.
Let's not see there in next releases (no merge of course), until better 
solution is ready. I will change that area when other things are ready.
