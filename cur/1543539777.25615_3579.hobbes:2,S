Good. You're now describing (to the best of my knowledge) the current
situation. In the case of SCSI, we have the SCSI drivers for each SCSI
controller, which use an additional layer of SCSI code, plus the
generic SCSI driver. This last one handles features that "don't
qualify" for a common API. 'nuff said ?
Oh, did I mention that you can probably destroy some SCSI devices with
sg ?
