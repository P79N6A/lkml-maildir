Subject: 2.2.9 - e2 filesystem corruption?

I have a dual pentium with an NCR53c810, two SCSI disks and SCSI cdrom.
Since I run 2.2.9 I notice that if (for whatever reason) I have to
boot without syncing filesystems, e2fsck fails fo fix filesystems
in automatic mode, and when run in manual mode, it finds weired
inconsistensies, moves files to lost+found, fixes insane number of
links etc.  Happend *very* rarely with previous kernels, and happends
almost *every* time with 2.2.9.
Do I need to do more investigation?
