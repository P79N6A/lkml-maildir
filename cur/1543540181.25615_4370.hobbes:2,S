It is something to do with some BIOSes placing their EBDA in some exotic
place in memory. For most practical purposes, if you edit lilo.h
CL_LENGTH        = 0x4e
and set it to higher value, it should work. I cc'd Werner Almesberger who
is the author of LILO so he knows better about the reasons and also if it
is going to be fixed any time soon or not.
