> we can do 32-bit ffz by doing 4x 8-bit ffz's though:
There are better algorithms than the branching one already. You can
do it a 32bit one with a multiply shift and 6 bit lookup if your multiply
is ok, or for non superscalar processors using shift and adds. 
64bit is 32bit ffz(x.low|x.high) and a single bit test
I can dig out the 32bit one if need be (its from a NetBSD mailing list)
