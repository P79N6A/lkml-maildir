   	- lower overhead for SMP systems.  We can use UP kernels local 
   	  to each CPU.  Should make kernel compiles faster. ;-)
Actually, this isn't what is being proposed.  Something like
"4 cpu" SMP kernels.
   At the very least it is well worth investigating.  Bootstrapping the 
   ccCluster work shouldn't take more than a week or so, which will let 
   us attach some hard numbers to the kind of impact it has on purely 
   cpu local tasks.
I think it is worth considering too, but I don't know if a week
estimate is sane or not :-)
