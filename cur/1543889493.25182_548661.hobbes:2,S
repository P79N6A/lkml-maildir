Yeah, the make-kpkg clean is highly annoying, and eventually made me
give up on using that tool. Instead, I've been using the deb-pkg
target that ships with the kernel. When bisecting, I use a script like
the one below to test a new kernel with a minimum of interaction. It
should give you a good idea of how to do all the steps by hand.
And yeah, paring down the .config is critical :-).
#!/bin/bash
sudo -v
make oldconfig
fakeroot make -j2 deb-pkg
sudo dpkg -i ../linux-2.6.20_2.6.20_amd64.deb
sudo update-initramfs -c -k 2.6.20
