Nicolas, Larry has not said he won't make the changes that Roman
wants, instead he has said he won't make the changes for FREE!.  There
is a perfectly reasonable solution. Raise the funds to pay for the
needed changes.
It is just not reasonable to expect Larry to fund work whose sole
purpose is to compete with himself. He is going a long way in saying
he will do the work if paid at standard rates.
Again, this is not Larry's fault, it is Linus that picked the tool.
