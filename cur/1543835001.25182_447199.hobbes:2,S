I don't know why the location of the hang changed.  It suggests you're up 
against some kind of race against the hardware.
The new location you found is in the driver core, and a bug was fixed in 
that region just about at the same time as you ran your test.  You might 
try redoing everything with the current -mm tree plus hotfixes.
And try running each test a few times.  If there is a race, you could get 
different results each time.
