hm.  So if I have
	struct bar {
		unsigned long b;
	} __attribute__((packed));
	struct foo {
		unsigned long u;
		struct bar b;
	};
then the compiler can see that foo.b.b is well-aligned, regardless of the
packedness.
Plus some crazy people compile the kernel with icc (or at least they used
to).  What happens there?
