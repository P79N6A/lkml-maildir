Subject: bootable lk 2.5 defconfig which

Anybody have a list of which lk 2.5 defconfig commonly do boot?
Or indeed the subset of that list that support loop.ko?  And X-Windows?
So far here I have only found that 2.5.56 boots clean.  2.5.26 gives me
results without gui.  2.5.47 does not loop.  2.5.37 2.5.41 2.5.51 do not
boot.  2.5.1 and 2.5.15 have no defconfig.
Seemingly irrelevant Google searches include:
