I guess so, since I've been upgrading steadily since I installed FC6 
some time ago.

Ah. I did see that, but stopped reading when I read it was fixed in 
later versions ... didn't get to the part where it still needed to be 
repaired/etc.

It did, and I did, and another xfs_check produced no output.
Do I need to do anything else to correct it? xfs_repair produced a whole 
bunch of stuff that I don't understand...this is the bit that looks most 
significant :

That last line looks suspicious...furthermore, when I mount the 
filesystem, I don't see a 'lost+found' directory (which I've been used 
to seeing on IRIX). Ah, perhaps the '...' with *nothing* after it means 
it didn't do any moving. Am I right?
