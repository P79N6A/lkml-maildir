For single shot I mean that once you receive one event, you will not
receive more events for that fd if you do not rearm it. Suppose you
receive 1000 bytes of data and you get an event (EPOLLIN). If after 10
seconds you receive another 1000 bytes, you will receive another event.
This is not single shot.
