Maybe I'm missing something, but xmms run OK with zero load, right? The 
problem is that, when building the kernel and the entire kde tree, each 
with make -j 16, xmms skips a few times? Well, tough luck...
And the user *can* do something about it, just nice -n 19 the builds and 
left xmms alone. (Or you can use other player... :-)
With this patch you can even say that each of the build processes can 
only hog 5% (at the most!) of the CPU (maybe the build is not a good 
example for mandatory CPU time caps, but it is usefull).
Besides, this implements a true run-only-when-noone-else-wants-to-run 
nice mode wich, combined with the absolut cpu time caps, hits some of my 
wish list for a complete scheduler :-) so I can't wait to test it :-)
A final note to John Lee: you may want to check the Class-based Kernel 
Resource Management (CKRM) at:
