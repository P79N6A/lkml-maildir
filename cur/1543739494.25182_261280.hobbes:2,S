Do you mean that you applied a patch, or had one and decided not to 
use it?  I just looked at mm/memory.c didn't notice anything 
substantially different in remap_page_range().  To which module was 
the patch applied?
Thanks for verifying that the approach I took was correct, which was
to use u64 for the phys address for remap_page_range().
