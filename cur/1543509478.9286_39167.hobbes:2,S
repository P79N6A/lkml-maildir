There are two valid cases, no fbdev + X, or fbdev + XF86_FBDev (a
special X server).  The third case, fbdev + non-XF86_FBDev server, often
works, but is just asking for trouble.

If the kernel driver allocated MTRRs, it should communicate that to the
Xserver fbdev support module.
Under fbdev, the X server is simply one among any number of graphics
applications.  The kernel cannot simply drop its MTRRs when the fbdev
device is opened by a user application.  And writing special case code
in fbdev just for X is the wrong way to go, IMHO.
