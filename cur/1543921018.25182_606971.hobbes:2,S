Ok - i actually didn't default to backward compatibility because I was
pretty sure you would object to it on the grounds that old userspace
might get unexpected behavior.  But I guess since all high caps should be
new ones for new features, it'll require new userspace to exploit
anyway.

Thanks.  I'll try to get a backward-compatible patch out today (again
just for rfc)  If not today, at least tomorrow.
