OK,  I have tried it without the delay, and with Ross' timer patch.  It will obviously lockup, and nmi_watchdog doesn't work.  Added the disconnect quirk patch, and lockups are gone and nmi_watchdog works.  So there is no difference between the disconnect patch or the ACK delay patch.  Though I found nmi_watchdog does depend on having either the disconnect patch or the delay patch (not an io_apic patch).  You think the disconnect patch is better?  In any event, they both indicate a behavior, and there maybe a better solution to all of it.
