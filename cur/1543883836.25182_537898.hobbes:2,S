Tejun helpfully posted a bunch of clashing patches for all the ACPI 
stuff :)  You might be better off dropping and getting a resend after 
the dust settles.
That LED trigger patch seems technically correct, but also filling a 
need that few have.  IMO it craps up the hot path for little gain.
The other stuff should be in my mbox to be reviewed and applied

8139too: needs review w/ attention paid to historical usage, and I 
haven't had time for months.  Not sure its right.
sundance: I really think this is phy-dependent, and should not be 
universally applied.  In the standard MII PHY, phy 0 is a ghost of 
another id.
forcedeth: TX NAPI wants more than that minimum effort
other stuff: in mbox

Usually PPP is paulus -> jgarzik -> linus, but you can bounce it 
straight to me if Paulus doesn't respond

I really wish "add ID" patches would not get buried in this tree.
Certainly they are trivial enough to go straight to Linus, but it would 
be nice to go through subsystem maintainers, some of whom have also 
picked up these new-id patches.
We don't send new-id patches for PCI drivers to GregKH, and we should 
similarly /not/ direct PCMCIA id patches to the PCMCIA bus tree.  It's 
far more scalable to send new-id patches to the maintainers dealing with 
the subsystem under which each driver falls (net, scsi, IDE, ...)

HP was kind enough to dig up another machine for me.  Other machines are 
appearing with x86 PCI domains (aka PCI segments) these days, so I need 
to get this into upstream.
