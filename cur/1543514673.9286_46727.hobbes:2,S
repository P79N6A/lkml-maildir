Hi,
We've got $SUBJECT, and an IDE disk (UDMA/33). Of course we want to install
Linux onto it. Which Linux kernel version will support this system well ?
I heard about hangs on IDE+SMP, so please mention a version which must be
run on this machine well. 2.2.13smp gives 'CPU TBL STUCK' or similar
messages, or hangs simply without any message. 2.2.14pre3-smp is similar.
Must I use 2.3.x kernel instead ?
Another interesting symptom : kernel compiling (it's for testing stability
with 'make -j 30') stops, but does not exit or so ... Alt+sysreq combos
reports 13 processes with 'R" state. Machine was usable for a while on
other terminals.
(kernels was compiled with gcc 2.7.2.3)
Thanx : Gabor,
