Thanks for the bugreport, be sure to CC me for opl3sa2 issues. I can check 
further and see where its dying. You can try running the latest -pre or 
newer -ac (careful about Alan's *fun* bits though ;) as that has a 
slightly updated version. I'm running 2.4.19-pre2-ac3 and can safely cat 
/proc/ioports.
Cheers,
