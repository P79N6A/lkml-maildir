A lot of the time you're right and it is just cosmetic.  But if memory
gets tight and it should be using swap, it mistakenly fails to do so,
so you may end up getting OOM-killed.  Patch below is a temporary hack
workaround against that.  The Mapped count also affects when dirty file
writeback kicks in, but the effect there appears to be less serious.
More worrying is, what else might sparc64 gcc-3.4 be getting wrong?
(if it really is to blame: looks to be so but not yet proven)
