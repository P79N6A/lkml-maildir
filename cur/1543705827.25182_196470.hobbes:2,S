My motherboard is k7n2-delta-l from MSI, and my mouse is Logitech PS/2 Optical Mouse Whell,
512mb of ram, no swap partitions
Well, always which compiling large sources like kde-3.2 and using XFree86-4.3.0 in parallel,
this bug is appears several times. Maybe not related with disks DMA/apic/acpi/preempt/agp issues,
Near of isolate bug is on VM system(stress it, like compiling kde-3.2 with no swap partitions) or 
I2C/ACPI Thermal zone/ACPI fans. Both have related with input system?
With lower load I newer take is bug. Anyone take?
