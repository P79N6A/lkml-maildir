Hmm... I have a bad feeling about that. I don't have the thing at hands
(didn't follow 2.2 for a while), but 99 times of 100 "stupid gcc
complaining about uninitialized variables" actually has a good reason for
such complaints. IOW, such change is _not_ a trivial cleanup. It may be
correct fix, but it may be turning random bug into deterministic one _and_
removing a hint that something may be amiss here.
