Definately a bug.
It is the same in 2.6 kernels (serial/8250.c).
One way or another, the interrupt must be cleared.

In my opinion, this is the correct way to handle the problem.
This is what I do in the SyncLink drivers.

The flip buffer and N_TTY line disciplines are
generic facilities for all tty drivers. They can't
directly perform device specific tasks like
enabling/disabling UART interrupts.
Adding notification to the driver to do these
tasks does not seem like a win either.
On a receive IRQ, the UART Rx FIFO
is already running out of space. If you
disable the rx IRQ, you will likely still lose
data shortly after.
That said, the flip buffer code could be improved
to provide better buffering to prevent lost data.
There may also be synchronization problems:
The driver usually calls tty_flip_buffer_push at
hard IRQ context to queue a task (flush_to_ldisc)
to feed the data to the line discipline. In the case
of a full flip buffer, the driver calls flush_to_ldisc
directly (via tty->flip.tqueue.routine) at hard IRQ context.
I don't see any locking in the flip buffer code
to synchronize this.
