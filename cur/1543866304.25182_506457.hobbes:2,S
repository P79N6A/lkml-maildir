Subject: [PATCH] block: blk_max_pfn is somtimes wrong
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

There is a small problem in handling page bounce.
At the moment blk_max_pfn equals max_pfn, which is in fact
not maximum possible _number_ of a page frame,  but the _amount_
of page frames. For example for the 32bit x86 node with 4Gb RAM,
max_pfn = 0x100000, but not 0xFFFF.
request_queue structure has a member q->bounce_pfn and queue needs
bounce pages for the pages _above_ this limit. This routine is handled
by blk_queue_bounce(), where the following check is produced:
	if (q->bounce_pfn >= blk_max_pfn)
		return;
Assume, that a driver has set q->bounce_pfn to 0xFFFF, but
blk_max_pfn equals 0x10000. In such situation the check above
fails and for each bio we always fall down for iterating over
pages tied to the bio.
I want to notice, that for quite a big range of device drivers
(ide, md, ...) such problem doesn't happen because they use
BLK_BOUNCE_ANY for bounce_pfn. BLK_BOUNCE_ANY is defined as
blk_max_pfn << PAGE_SHIFT, and then the check above doesn't fail.
But for other drivers, which obtain reuired value from drivers,
it fails. For example sata_nv uses ATA_DMA_MASK or dev->dma_mask.
I propose to use (max_pfn - 1) for blk_max_pfn. And the
same for blk_max_low_pfn. The patch also cleanses some checks
related with bounce_pfn.
