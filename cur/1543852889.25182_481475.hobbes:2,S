Hmmm, I didn't know such a thing existed.

Just make sure it gets submitted upstream so it gets no lost.
I don't have a particular use for the accelerometer myself, I was just
digging thru the pile of my local patches and I noticed that all the
work (mine, yours and others) on the ams device seemed on its way to be
lost, since nobody picked up the patch.
But if you're still actively working on it and plan to submit it later,
that's perfectly ok with me.
Stelian.
