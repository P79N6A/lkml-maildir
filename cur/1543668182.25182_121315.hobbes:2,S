Don't think so.  You were getting 0xff when reading all PCI registers.  In
this case it is only the MAC address (which comes from an external eeprom)
which is coming up as 0xff.
0xff in the PCI regisers is a PCI setup problem, 0xff in the eeprom is a
power management problem.
(But the PCI IDs are read out of the eeprom into the PCI interface hardware
by the hardware.  So the EEPROM must have been powered up and down again at
some point.)
