Yes, but this is not so strange, this means the queueing in progress. Most
probably the "owner" of WORK_STRUCT_PENDING bit spins waiting for cwq->lock.
We will retry in this case. Of course, if we have a workqueue with the single
work which just re-arms itself via queue_work() (without delay) and does nothing
more, we may need a lot of looping.

It is useable, at least for me. I hope you will re-ack when I actually send
the patch. Note that the "else" branch above doesn't need cwq->lock, and we
should start with del_timer(), because the pending timer is the most common
case.
