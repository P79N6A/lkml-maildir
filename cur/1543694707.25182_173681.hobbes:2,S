I have been corrected!  While /dev/md0 may not be correctly detected in
Macintosh (PPC) partitions, they should be recognized in MSDOS and SUN
partition tables.  You probably won't need a 'md0=...' command line for
most configurations.
I apologize for any confusion i may have created.  Thank you very much
for the correction, Andre.

P.S.  I believe the relevant HOW-TO is:
    
http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Boot
+Root+Raid+LILO.html
    Boot+Root+Raid+LILO, Boot + Root + Raid + Lilo : Software Raid mini-HOWTO
    Updated: July 2000. A cookbook for setting up root raid using the 0.90
    raidtools for bootable raid mounted on root using standard LILO. 
Good luck!
