Subject: [RFC][PATCH 6/6][v3] Protect cinit from blocked fatal signals
Normally SIG_DFL signals to global and container-init are dropped early.
But if a signal is blocked when it is posted, we cannot drop the signal
since the receiver may install a handler before unblocking the signal.
Once this signal is queued however, the receiver container-init has
no way of knowing if the signal was sent from an ancestor or descendant
namespace.  This patch ensures that contianer-init drop all SIG_DFL
signals in get_signal_to_deliver() except SIGKILL/SIGSTOP.
If SIGSTOP/SIGKILL originate from a descendant of container-init they
are never queued (i.e dropped in sig_ignored() in an earler patch).
If SIGSTOP/SIGKILL originate from parent namespace, the signal is queued
and container-init processes the signal.
See comments in patch below for details.
