Argh.   That should read
+                   if (status & (1<<8) && status & 0x1800)
I'm tempted to change some of these magical numbers into #defines...
That would make it a bit easier to read, but have no functional
changes--would such a patch be accepted into the various trees?
Just my two bits.  ;)
