I've been experiencing a particular kind of hang for many versions
(since 2.3.99 days, recently seen with 2.4.1, 2.4.2, and 2.4.2-ac4) on
the alpha architecture.  The symptom is that any program that tries to
access the process table will hang. (ps, w, top) The hang will go away
by itself after ~10minutes - 1 hour or so.  When it hangs I run ps and
see that it gets halfway through the process list and hangs.  The
process that comes next in the list (after hang goes away) almost always
has nonsensical memory numbers, like multi-gigabyte SIZE.
