Beats me, but then the prefetch code in 2.6 seems broken from
5 seconds of inspection anyway. We are testing the XMM feature
and using prefetchnta for Athlon, thats wrong for lots of athlon
processors that dont have XMM but do have prefetch/prefetchw,
(which btw also seem to work properly on all these processors
 while prefetchnta seems to do funky things)
Perhaps someone should fix prefetch() before they worry about 
the rest of the mess ?
For Athlon we should be testing 3Dnow, and using prefetch/prefetchw
for Intel cases we want to go for prefetchnta if XMM is set (PIII, PIV)
