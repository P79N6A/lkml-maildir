Yes acpi=off solved the APM problem.
I am able to suspend my laptop again!
In Mandrake Control Center, in the Lilo parameter options the acpi=off or 
acpi=on is prepared! There is a second option which can be set: "noapic". 
There is no other option.
But by default, it was acpi=on and apic.
Thanks  a lot!
