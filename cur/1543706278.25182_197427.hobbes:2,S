[PATCH] PCI: fix "pcibus_class" Device Class, release function

You're right that the class device isn't currently unregistered, and
that was an oversight in the patch I originally sent.  Attatched is a
patch that remedies that situation.  pci_remove_bus_device() *is* the
natural place to unregister the class_dev, and that's just what the
patch does.

Yep.  The patch pulls the kfree() out of pci_remove_bus_device() and
calls class_device_unregister() in it's place.  This will put() the
bridge device and free the pci_bus as needed.  put() does need to be
called twice because the bridge device is get()'d twice: once when the
device is registered and once when it's bus device grabs a reference to it.
