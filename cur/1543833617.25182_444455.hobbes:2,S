Jeff (Garzik), the above error is specific to glibc 2.4. There is a workaround 
patch (which is wrong, but makes UML compile - and the affected code is not 
normally used except for debugging).
Jeff (Dike), please choose one of the "simple" patches I suggested (comment 
out offending code, for instance) since you (correctly) deferred the real fix 
(incorporating klibc's setjmp implementation) to later.
