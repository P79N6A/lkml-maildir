I'd rather suggest to really throw it outta the kernel. Nobody seems to
maintain it so it can be considered dead. IMHO, it's better to lack such a
driver that have one that does not compile, less for work.
Not that I have such a card around, but it's aestetically dissapointing to
have something in the kernel which does not and probably will not compile
and work in foreseable future...
