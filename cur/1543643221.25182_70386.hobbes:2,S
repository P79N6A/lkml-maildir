  Yes I'd just logged in and manually mounted it.

It looked around 1/4 to 1/2 done with dbench 32.  I'm not sure if it was 
the 1st or second run.  I run dbench from a script:
sync
sync
./dbench 2
sync
sync
./dbench 4
sync
sync
./dbench 8
sync
sync
./dbench 16
sync
sync
./dbench 32
sync
sync
./dbench 64
sync
sync

  I generally use this script narrow down which configurations seem to 
be most promising.

4G ram, and 4G swap.
