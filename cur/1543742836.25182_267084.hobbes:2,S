I did notice that patch from a while ago. 
The code in DRM CVS works and it has no DRM() macros, inter_module_xx
is gone, and it splits DRM in to DRM-core plus personality modules.
Now all we have to do is get it merged into the kernel.  The diffs are
huge due to lindent reformatting and removal of DRM() macros.

I'm still working on the merged fbdev/DRM but it doesn't work right
yet. Making fbdev understand multiple heads is causing considerable
changes to fbdev since the fb_info structure does not separate per
head variables from per card ones. I don't have the split sorted out
yet.
The code is based off from DRM CVS. bk://mesa3d@bkbits.net/drm-fb
