This isn't acceptable in stable kernels. FreeBSD has a very tight
policy, newer kernels off the same branch support older user space. The
upgrade path is clear, reboot into new kernel, have it spit a few
reminders that your userspace needs update (Linux also has this, for
instance, with SG_IO and its predecessors) but still everything works.
Requiring new userspace at a patchlevel kernel upgrade is nothing but
impertinent, unless that updated userspace ships as part of the kernel.
