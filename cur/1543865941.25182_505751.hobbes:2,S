You are referring to current Linux implementation?
The AMD64 architecture increased physical address size in PSE mode to
40 bits. So at least it would be possible to use more than 32 bits.

I was afraid you'ld say that.

No, I don't have access to such a box. Would be nice though.

Right you are!

Ok, it is best to do (3).
I will come up with another patch asap.
