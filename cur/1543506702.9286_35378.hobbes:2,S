Hi All,
  I've just installed 2.3.14 and have tried to put on pcmcia-cs-3.0.14
(which I have done before on previous kernels). However when I go to compile
it, it just falls over. Is there anything that has been addred into the
kernel recently which interferes with the compilation As far as I can tell
it is falling over in cardbus.c in function cb_setup_cis_mem
