Hi Jussi,
        I found out that the problem was not the Promise controller
but a bug in the ALI chipset. Disabling the specific driver for that
chipset (and DMA as well :/ ) gives me atleast the possibility to work.
The bug for the ALI was discussed in another thread.
What makes me worried now is that 2/3 people are reporting a similar
problem but using different chipsets. Can be a problem located somewhere
else???? Dunno..... just a guess.
Fabio
