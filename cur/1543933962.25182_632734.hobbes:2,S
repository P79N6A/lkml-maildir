This NIC (a Networth UTP16B) has a National Semiconductor DP83905 AT/LANTIC 
for which I'm reading the software developers guide now. It doesn't seem to 
list specific delays...
I also just now dug up a "WDC (C) 1987" WD8003EBT and a "Novell, Inc (C) 
1990" NE1000, both 8-bit ISA NICs and the ownership of which, I would 
suggest, makes me a really cool person. Both are coax and a little clumsy to 
test but that 1987 one is probably going to be close to the oldest type around.
I've been testing with the 386's own 2.2.26 kernel upto now but I'll try and 
compile a 2.6 system on there with uclibc and busybox or some such and test 
more.
Rene.
