Is there some other preferred call we could be making 
instead of set_cpus_allowed() ?  We need to be able to
program the MSRs on that specific core, and as far as
I know, the only way to do that is to guarantee that
we are scheduled on that particular core.  
If there's a better way to hop to a specific core, I'll
gladly rewrite the code in question.
