Subject: Invalid module format?

I have two device drivers for two separate PCI cards.
Using the 2.6.15.6 I can compile and insert both of these drivers.
I copy my sources to my 2.6.16.16 tree and recompile them.  One driver
inserts just fine (and works) and the other gives me this:
FATAL: Error inserting ibb
(/lib/modules/2.6.16.16/kernel/drivers/mvp/ibb.ko): Invalid module
format
The same source file between both kernels and I get no errors at compile
time.
This is a Fedora Core 3 system running on a Dell PE1800.
:b!
