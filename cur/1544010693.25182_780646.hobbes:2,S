Subject: [PATCH 0/22] more AMD IOMMU updates for 2.6.29

Hi,
this is the rest of AMD IOMMU updates for the 2.6.29 merge window (the
other part is contained in the KVM device passthrough patchsets posted
before).
These patches include some cleanups and improvements for PCI device
hotplug. The most interesting part is the new stats collection facility.
Once enabled, the user can see various high-level statistics about what
the IOMMU code (mostly limited to DMA-API) is doing in debugfs. This can
be used to optimize this and other code (e.g. pv-dma in KVM) in the
future.
Joerg
