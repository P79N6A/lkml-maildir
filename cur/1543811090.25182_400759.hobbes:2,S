I've raised the MTU from 1500 to 3000 and still reproduced the hang. Would you 
mind sending me a patch for forcing rx_buffer_size to 4k, so I can try that, 
or is no sense in that, given that raising the MTU didn't help?
Concerning information on chip behavior, are you missing vendor specs, or 
could I be helpful by reproducing the hang with an instrumented driver that 
gives more information about the chip status at hang time?
Another thing that may be worth to find out is why 0.13 with Carl-Daniel 
Hailfingers fix works. I didn't see a single hang with that version. I'm 
currently resorting to that version, but well ...
I'd really like to help get this driver working robustly. I'm not enough into 
networking to help by coding, but yes I'll give feedback on any driver 
version you send me. I'd just like to provide you more helpful data than 
repeating "new version still hangs" ;-)
