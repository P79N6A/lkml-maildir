I dont think its good idea to add capabilities
this way: make fs capabilities drop only, and
if you want to raise, make it setuid root.
Kernel will see its suid, will raise capabilities, and
then drop them according to the fs fields.
Thats okay, and old apps will see its suid root
and treat it with care.
The only bad thing about this is how to make
something suid games, addcap hw access.
