Has anyone thought of adding a feature of disabling the infamous
Intel Pentium III processor serial number, which any application
can get using CPUID instruction? According to CPUID specs [1],
the PSN can be disabled (part 3.3, disabling PSN) with a single
CPUID call, until next reboot. This could be configured with
/proc/sys/kernel entry, writing 1 would disable the PSN. Any
subsequent calls would be ignored.
