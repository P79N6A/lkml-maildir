No I don't think it would -- this is an internal Philips IP block number AFAIK and was given there only for reference.
Funny is that people from Philips Semi asked me about a year ago not to use internal IP block numbers in the code. I know you're also from Philips... Well, what does that prove? It proves that everything can't be in alignment in such a big company. ;-)

IIRC, PNX5220 has a slightly different register map. Of course the main registers are the same but putting first N regs into common header and putting others into arch header would have made even less sense.
