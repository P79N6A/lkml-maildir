OK, sorry for a delay in reply - I haven't rebooted since last mail.
I have something _really_ peculiar ongoing on here (ignoring PnP - this isn't 
my issue now, I feel).
Info (lspci):
00:0f.0 Multimedia audio controller: Creative Labs SB Live! EMU10k1 (rev 07)
00:0f.1 Input device controller: Creative Labs SB Live! MIDI/Game Port (rev 
07)
This morning I built and installed 2.6.15.4.  On reboot, I got control errors 
again ('alsactl restore' is run from rc.local):
Sorting SB Live! sound (alsactl restore)...
alsactl: set_control:894: warning: name mismatch (Sigmatel Surround Playback 
Volume/Sigmatel Surround Playback Switch) for control #47
alsactl: set_control:896: warning: index mismatch (0/0) for control #47
alsactl: set_control:1008: bad control.47.value index
Ummm.  At the command line, same errors also.  So I deleted /etc/asound.state 
and reconfigured alsamixer from scratch.  Then following 'alsactl store', 
'alsactl restore' completes without issue (i.e. works clean).
If I then reboot, the same damn control #47 errors happen again.  It's as if 
something changes my asound.state file at boot time time?
Ideas?  This is driving me potty.
Nick
