I was prepared to write such a gatway.
We discussed it, and found that the combination of BitKeeper license
and BitMover's control over the kernel repository prevents it.  This
was the subject of a heated debate.
I believe that debate was the reason BitMover wrote and now host the
BK->CVS gateway, which other gateways are built upon.
It's a brilliant solution, and thank you, I am glad of your work,
but let's not pretend that a 3rd party is in a position to offer such
a gateway.
(You need either the BK protocol, the right to run BK, or a copy of
the BK repository files to extract data from, and none of these are
available to a 3rd party who wants to write and support a BK->whatever
gateway for the kernel tree.  I asked; all 3 were refused).
