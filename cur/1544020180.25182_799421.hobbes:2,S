I recognized that everything seems to work just fine *on console only*.
At least I could suspend and resume via s2ram >3 times in a row.
What also worked was to just start plain X (no window manager or
anything) and suspend/resume then. However with compiz running I am
seeing the garbage/hang on resume.
Are you by chance to having an ATI card + use a compositing window
manager?
