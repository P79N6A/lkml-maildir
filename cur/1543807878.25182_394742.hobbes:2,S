  Agree with this. At the time the code was written I did not run into
any issues with it, hence it was the default. Unfortunately, I do not
remember exact platforms. (yes, platforms, not BIOS versions -
unfortunately, lots of bugs are introduced during tailoring BIOS to
particular platform).

Frankly, we are still not doing it early enough. On some platforms it
causes huge delays during some of ACPI code, and quirks are working
afterward... Moving handoff earlier resolves the issue, but this may be
a bit of extreme...

No, it's been like this all the time. Compare 'switch' and 'if'
statements in the patch against single original 'if' but with 2
conditions. Your patch is actually different in the following ways:
- it goes over all possible capabilities instead of processing just
first one - right thing to do;
- it always sets OS ownership, even if BIOS did not have it.
- it always disables SMI, not just in case when handoff failed. This
probably right way to cleanup after BIOS which does handoff, but does
not disable SMI afterward.
  In other words, it does stop doing what previous code was doing, it
just extends it. And according to Greg, it extends it in right way ;-)

Agree.
