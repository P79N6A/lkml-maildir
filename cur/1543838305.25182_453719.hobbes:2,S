It was impossible to get. I set the 'init' kernel option to a dedicated
script to dump dmesg, but even that went way past the messages.
It seems however that I managed to get everything a-ok now, I just
booted with 'i8042.noaux=1' and that seemed to have resolved everything.
This lappy is proving a challenge to get perfect (but I'm getting
there!)
