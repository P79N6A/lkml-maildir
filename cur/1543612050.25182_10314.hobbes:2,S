There seems to be a little misunderstanding here; from what
I gathered when talking to Larry, the idea behind ccClusters
is that they provide a single system image in a NUMA box, but
with separated operating system kernels.
Of course, this is close to what a "single" NUMA kernel often
ends up doing with much ugliness, so I think Larry's idea to
construct NUMA OSes by putting individual kernels of nodes to
work together makes a lot of sense.

Rik
