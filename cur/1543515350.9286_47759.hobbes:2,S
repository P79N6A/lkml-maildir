Hehe, not only.
It also depends on how many modules are already registered !
I've benchmarked it and if you have more than some 1000 modules
in the kernel (I tried it with dummy modules (insmod -o dummy1 dummy.o;
insmod -o dummy2 dummy.o)) then the insert is very slow because
of the linked-list and resolving design (insert can take some seconds
for a do nothing module).
But the module code it self looks extremely clever to me.
