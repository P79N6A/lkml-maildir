It isn't a terribly gross hack.  I have a patch (somewhere...) which
adds an ASID: field to /proc/<pid>/status, which simply contains the mm
pointer (as an opaque identifier token).  If you were worried about
exposing (yet another) kernel pointer value, I suppose you could mush it
about a bit, but I think that would give the illusion of obscurity
rather than any actual increase in security.
