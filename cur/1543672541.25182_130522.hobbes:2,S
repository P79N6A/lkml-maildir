Which is a different behaviour, now you can't create a device node
manually anymor.  Also note that the feature you rely on here (devfs
presetting file->private_data) will go away in the next round of patches,
see Al Viro's patchit for a generic replacement that works with or
without devfs.

Okay, you're right I should have read more of the code to get the global
picture.  You still wan't an owner field for at least struct dvb_device
device, though - but the try_module_get must go into dvb_generic_open
and maybe in more other places where you use the "backend" modules.
