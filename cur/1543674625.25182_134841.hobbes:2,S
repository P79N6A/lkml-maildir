I am not sure of the exact environment install_page() is meant
to run in, does it always know that no mapping exists at that
address?
If not, something (either there or higher up) needs to be doing
a flush_cache_page(...) at a minimum.
The things that some platforms use flush_icache_page() for are
handled by other platforms using other mechanisms in clever ways (for
example, at update_mmu_cache() or instruction TLB miss time, older
sparc64's use special D/I cache flush block stores to handle the I-cache
coherency problem there).
