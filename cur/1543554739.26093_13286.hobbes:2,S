So in shm_swap_out I check if the page is already in the swap
cache. If not I put the page into it and note the swap entry in the
shadow pte of shm. Right?
So does the page live all the time in the swap cache? This would lead
to a vastly increased swap usage since we would have to preallocate
the swap entries on page allocation.
