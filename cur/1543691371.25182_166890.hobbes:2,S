Hi Aki,
  what do you expect without enabling driver for your IDE chipset?
Enable it, and hdparm will work...
  You are supposed to run 'make oldconfig' after each kernel upgrade,
and answer all new questions it asks you... Otherwise you'll not
notice that IDE driver got split to the couple of chipset modules.
