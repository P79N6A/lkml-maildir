We have those as well. (Supermicro P4SCT+ which have a rev 03 88sx8041
part.)

I have a totally different set of source code files for the 
MV88SX50[4|8][0|1] chips, also open-source from Marvell (although I have
to check the exact license).
Looking at the Highpoint source code, they seem to have taken some of 
the Marvell source code (mv*.*) and adapted it for their RAID system.
I am interested in doing some maintenance work on the Marvell driver,
which indeed mostly needs attention to proper locking. Also, it did
not yet support the rev 03 hardware when I downloaded it.
I found the driver source on 
ftp://ftp.supermicro.com
, but it seems to
have been removed lately. Supermicro forwards me to Adaptec who writes
the BIOS raid system (ugh).
Regards,
Leon.
