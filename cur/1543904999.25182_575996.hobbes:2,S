Im still not so keen about this, Ingo never did get CFS to match SD in
smoothness for 3d applications, where my test subjects are quake(s),
world of warcraft via wine, unreal tournament 2004. And this is despite
many patches he sent me to try and tweak it. As far as im concerned, i
may be forced to unofficially maintain SD for my own systems(allthough
lots in the gaming community is bound to be interrested, as it does make
games lots better)
