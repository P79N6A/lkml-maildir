It is pretty hard to implement kobject handling correctly. Consider the
following:
	rmmod device_driver < /sys/devices/pci0000:00/...../power/state
for a driver that creates/destroys device objects.
 
Opening 'state' attribute will pin device structure into memory but will
not increase _your_ module's refcount. It is nice if you have a subsystem
core split from drivers code - then you can keep core module reference
until device objects are gone and allow individual drivers be unloaded
freely. But for single-module system it is pretty hard, that's why
platform devices are popular.
