In the past I have only done patches against the 2.6.x kernels. I'm
thinking, however, of requesting space on kernel.org for patches against
-rcX and -mm kernels. You're the second person to ask. If I get asked
some more, I might do it :> (It's not that it's hard, just that it takes
time and today is my last day working on the code full time).
