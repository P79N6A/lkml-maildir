I'm no expert on x86, but if an interrupt was messing with %ebx, you'd
have random crashes verywhere - userspace, kernel space in unpredicatable
ways.

Well, compared with your previous report, your latest report is different.
Your first report had  both EIP and %ebx being zero (because they got
corrupted when returning from serial_in).  This time only %ebx was
corrupted.
Consequently, this time we oopsed in the subsequent serial_in() rather
than trying to return to serial8250_startup() as last time.

From that I take it that you removed the test in serial8250_startup which
sets UART_BUG_TXEN, and the problem persisted.  That tends to suggest
that it's not the culpret.

Would be nice to know.

The one which sets UART_BUG_TXEN.
