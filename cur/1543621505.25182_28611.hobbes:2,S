That's right.  This is a CML2 require/prohibit construct.  CML1 cannot
express this, and it's essential for side-effect forcing to work.  Jeff's
observation about being tempted to introduce a `require' turns out actually 
to be equivalent once you see how both problems generalize.
You can't deduce these constraints from graph analysis, because they're 
not implicit in the if/then tree structure that is the only thing CML1
knows about.
Jeff and Alan have now almost caught up to where I was two years ago when
I realized the CMl1 formalism was inadequate.
This is going in the FAQ.
