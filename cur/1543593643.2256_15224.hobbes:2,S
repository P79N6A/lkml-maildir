Both of these are slow, actually. I'm getting 7.5-8MB/s when receiving 
from a 100Mbit box (tulip or starfire, doesn't seem to matter). 
Transmitting is still slow for me, but that is most likely a different 
problem -- and I'm looking into it.
Moreover, I'm getting 9+MB/s in both directions when using the other 
driver (xircom_tulip_cb), patched to do half-duplex only. So the card can 
definitely transfer at network speeds.

Looking forward to seeing them...
Thanks,
