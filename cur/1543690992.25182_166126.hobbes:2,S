"smaller and simpler" hmm.  And _more_ buggy.  Let's take this case:
	add_wait_queue(&wq, &wait);
	for (;;) {
		set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE);
		if (condition)
			break;
		if (file->f_flags & O_NONBLOCK) {
			ret = -EAGAIN;
			break;
		}
		if (signal_pending(current)) {
			ret = -ERESTARTSYS;
			break;
		}
		schedule();
	}
	__set_current_state(TASK_RUNNING);
	remove_wait_queue(&wq, &wait);
There are cases like the above which make the wait_event*() macros
inappropriate:
- needing to test for extra conditions to set "ret" accordingly (eg,
  non-blocking IO)
- needing to atomically dequeue some data
I've yet to see anyone using wait_event*() in these circumstances -
they're great for your simple "did something happen" case which the
majority of drivers use, but there are use cases where wait_event*()
is not appropriate.
