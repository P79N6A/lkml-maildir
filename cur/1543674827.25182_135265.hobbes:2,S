As a FWIW, this driver is mainly intended as a Serial ATA driver.
It just happens to do PATA by coincedence (i.e. because it makes devel 
easier for me).
For example, current Intel SATA is "PATA, but without the timing junk."
I think with SATA + drivers/ide, you reach a point of diminishing 
returns versus amount of time spent on mid-layer coding.
