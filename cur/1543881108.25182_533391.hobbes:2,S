It is a user interface, not a print statement.  Your suggested change
would be vetoed by any number of people.  
So either we have all mounts having owners, AND have /proc/mounts add
"user=0" to all mounts.  While I don't _think_ this would actually
break userspace, it would definitely make people complain.
The other choice is what the current patchset does: is to have
"legacy" mounts without owners, and "new generation" mounts with
owners having "user=UID" in /proc/mounts, regardless of the value of
UID.

You don't.  Unprivileged mounts _imply_ MS_SETUSER.

Well, OK.  I'll do the user_struct thing then.
