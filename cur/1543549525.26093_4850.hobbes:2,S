Subject: 2.4 kernels do not boot on UX (Alpha)

I tried to boot recent 2.4.0 kernels (the last one 2.4.0-test9-pre5)
on Ruffian type of Alpha, also known as UX, with a notable lack
of success.  So far I had not a single succesful boot.  My test
machine ran without any hiccups various 2.2 kernels, patched and
upatched, and before that a long list of 2.0 kernels.
Here are excerpts from boot messages, transcribed from a screen,
which seem to be relevant to the problem:

and a kernel panic because my root file system on /dev/sda2 cannot be
mounted.  The machine is dead with even a keyboard gone.
There is also another failure mode when some messages are scrolling
up the screen too fast to be of any use because a screen is flooded
with repeated messages:
pc_keyb: controller jammed (0xFF).
followed by:
keyboard timed out [1].
and a kernel hangs the moment it should print 
hda: IBM-DJNA-370910, ATA DISK drive
line. The second failure mode happens apparently less often but
apparently at random.
For comparison here are similar lines from a correct boot of a kernel
from 2.2 series on the same machine:

In particular note differences in a detected SCSI controller and lack
of problems on a partition check. I also do not know from where
"DECchip 21052" is coming with 2.4 kernel.  The real ethernet
controller is DS21143 Tulip rev. 48.
This is a PCI layout as reported by 'lspci -tv':
-[00]-+-0d.0-[01]--+-0a.0  Trident Microsystems 4DWave DX
      |            \-0d.0  Symbios Logic Inc. (formerly NCR) 53c875

      +-0f.0  Digital Equipment Corporation DECchip 21142/43
      \-11.0  Texas Instruments TVP4020 [Permedia 2]
Any ideas what gives here?
