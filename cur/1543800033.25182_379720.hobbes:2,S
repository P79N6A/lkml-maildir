The MMC password support seems to be a subset of the operations
possible on modern ATA drives. IMHO, any interface you introduce
should be usable for both types of devices.
The only interface I could find for ATA is through HDIO_DRIVE_CMD.
This is currently used by hdparm, but it does not look like it
fits the MMC problem well.
Has anyone already done an ioctl or sysfs implementation of ATA
password user interfaces, or is perhaps the one proposed here
sufficient for ATA drives as well?
