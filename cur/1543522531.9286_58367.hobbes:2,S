This behavior is entirely consistent with my previous reply.  The new
version of the bios probably dropped E801 reporting.

I don't believe this is a kernel problem. I had a similar experience with
the
2.2.13 kernel when I flashed my Abit BH6 v1.1 BIOS to the latest image.
After
eliminating the other possiblities (I had added more RAM at the same time),
I
flashed back to the original image and all the RAM was detected
automatically
again. I am a little mystified as to the mechanism, but I was sufficiently
careful in my troubleshooting to believe the BIOS is the problem, and your
note
confirms this.
I'd recommend you send a note to Abit telling them to undo whatever change
they've made to RAM detection/initialization for all their most recent
BIOSes.
