I get this problem both in Linux and Windows, so I won't
rule out hardware/bios bugs, but I find that often when my
monitor (backlight) gets turned off automatically after a
long period of non-use, the computer freezes up.  I think it
only happens when I've left it that way for a long time,
though.  If I move the mouse immediately after the screen is
blacked, I have no trouble, but if I leave it for a long
time, when I get back the monitor won't unblack,
ctrl-alt-backspace does nothing, ctrl-alt-delete does
nothing,  Fn-Suspend, Fn-A don't do anything, and the
capslock and numlock keys don't do anything either.  I
haven't tried reaching the machine from outside yet, but I
will if someone wants.  Possibly useful note: when the
computer is in this state and I remove the (PCMCIA) network
card and re-insert it, it does not get reset.  This could
indicate a complete lockup.
