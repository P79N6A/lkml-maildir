Is this failure with suspend to RAM or to disk?
How about if you try this patch?
http://linux-acpi.bkbits.net:8080/to-akpm/cset@423b4875tyauh4CrSSoQfXOEPDkmUw
patch -Rp1 from 2.6.12-rc1-mm and see if it stops being broken
or patch -Np1 to 2.6.12-rc and see if it starts being broken.
This one removes an earlier attempt at resuming PCI links -- now
putting the onus on the drivers to be properly written
to release and acquire their interrupt for a successful suspend/resume.
In theory, this is taken care of something like this:
driver.resume
	pci_enable_device
		pci_enable_device_bars
			pcibios_enable_device
				pcibios_enable_irq
					acpi_pci_irq_enable
but if the patch above makes a difference, then theory != practice:-)
I'd believe that ohci_hcd and ehci_hcd are fragile since glancing
at their lengthy .resume routines it isn't immediately obvious
that they do this.  But yenta_dev_resume has a pci_enable_device(),
so that failure may be less straightforward.
cheers,

ps. if point me to a full dmesg -s64000 from 2.6.12-rc1 acpi-enabled
boot, that would help -- for it will show if we're even using pci
interrupt links (and programming them) for these devices on this box.
