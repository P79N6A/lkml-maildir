Yeah, PREEMPT would be able to show most races like this too. In fact, 
some races show up much better with preemption than they do with real SMP.
But I haven't looked at what exactly reiserfs does. I did check that the 
VM layer definitely does the remove_vma() stuff (that actually closes the 
files) _after_ it has unmapped everything. It would have surprised me if 
we had had that kind of bug, but still..
