You're saying that you consider it acceptable to bounce email to
5000 to 10000 people, possibly thousands of messages?  And that
you knew it may occur in advance?  I would think the responsible
thing to do would be to unsubscribe from the mailing list
temporarily until your problem is solved.  Anything less is
purely apathetic on your part.

Signature poll:  I'm planning on getting a 12 or 16 port autosensing
10/100 ethernet switch soon for home use, and am interested in hearing
others recommendations on what to buy.  Cost isn't as important as is
functionality and quality.  Any suggestions appreciated.
