There don't seem to be any users of this. How do you know it hasn't
already bitrotted?
It seems quite overcomplicated to me. Has the complexity been justified?

Also it needs another review round I guess. And some beta testing by
more people.

Didn't he have one already? There was a relatively simple readahead
