    [XFS] implement generic xfs_btree_delete/delrec
    Make the btree delete code generic. Based on a patch from David Chinner
    with lots of changes to follow the original btree implementations more
    closely. While this loses some of the generic helper routines for
    inserting/moving/removing records it also solves some of the one off bugs
    in the original code and makes it easier to verify.
