It really was. Directories were historically largely just files too, 
although with the special "lookup" operation. 
Historic unix didn't have readdir/rmdir/mkdir/rename or really much _any_
special directory handling. Directories were just files, and you read them 
like files.
Of course, even in that early unix, "directories" were very much a 
reality even apart from the fact that they happened to be implemented 
pretty much like files. Nobody has ever claimed that the UNIX way is 
"everything is _one_ file", after all ;)

Yes. Highly likely. However, something like that _does_ end up what a 
Windows fileserver wants. IOW, even if it's broken, _something_ is likely 
forced on us by that nasty thing we call "real users". Damn them.
