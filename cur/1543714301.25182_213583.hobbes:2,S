With due respect to Realtek and others, some pesky bugs in the driver
were really (c) by me.
The issues related to 64 bit host and/or link recovery seem to be gone.
If people experience issues with the r8169 driver in -mm/-netdev whereas
the vanilla driver works fine, I am interested to hear from them.
Preferably now.
