But PM and your migrate code can be not the only users of it.

It is almost ok, but it is still not fine :)
look what happens if you call freeze/unfreeze in a loop:
refrigerator:
awakes
freezer:
check PF_FROZEN, it is still set, skips task and thinks it is finished 
freezing.
refrigerator:
clears PF_FROZEN and TIF_FREEZE and returns.
I think you can fix this by moving PF_FROZEN check and set in both 
places under siglock.
