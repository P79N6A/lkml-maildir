Hi,
Many drivers have their probe routines declared as __devinit which is
a no-op unless CONFIG_HOTPLUG is set. However driver's bind/unbind
attributes are created unconditionally, as fas as I can see. Would not
it cause an oops if someone tries to use these attributes with
CONFIG_HOTPLUG=N? Am I missing something?
Also, unbind implementation does not seem safe - we check the driver
before taking device's semaphore so we risk unbinding wrong driver (in
the unlikely event that we manage to unbind and bind another driver in
another thread).
