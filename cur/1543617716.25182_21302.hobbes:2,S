Hi all,
thank you very much for your convenience and effort.
I've now located the real reason for all my problems.
It was just a bad memory modul. Believe me, i'd tested them before
carefully.
But i had to learn that even ECC-modules installed in brand motherboards
dont tell you that they are not working correctly.
After trying all new kernel versions and patches i was really
desperated.
All the discussions in the LKLM concerning the new vm +swap
frustated me since i was really thinking that the stable kernel tree is
not really stable.
I'm a user of linux since 0.99pl2 so this would have been a new
experience to me.
All in all i'm still wondering that the system was working anyway.
So finding the real error was just inspiration and luck.
Thanx for all hints
	Klaus
