IA-64 is also trying to be helpful by putting the message where
the user may actually see it (following the dquot precedent).  But
the whole subject of whether we should print any messages for
unaligned accesses at all is rather controversial.  So its a 50-50
shot whether I'll fix it by adding the mutex_lock/mutex_unlock
around the use of current->signal->tty, or just rip this out and
just leave the printk().
