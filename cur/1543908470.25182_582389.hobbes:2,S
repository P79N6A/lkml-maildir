Reordering due to compiler optimizations.  CPU reordering does not
affect interactions with interrupt handlers on a given CPU, but
reordering due to compiler code-movement optimization does.  Since
volatile can in some cases suppress code-movement optimizations,
it can affect interactions with interrupt handlers.
