There seems to be a conflict between the new changes to the input
system (as in 2.6.9-rc2-mm4 and 2.6.9-rc2-bk13) and the alps patch.
I tried both with mm4 with the already included alps patch and with
bk11 and bk13 with the patch manually applied. In both cases when
starting X with the alps driver input is completely dead in X, both
mouse and keyboard, including sysrq keys and num-lock/caps-lock.
I can ssh in, kill X and everything is functional again (although the
keyboard behaves as if num-lock is presses, enabling/disabling it
solves that).
If I start X with the ImPS/2 driver with the same kernel then the input
works fine except for the mouse being a bit slow.
In console everything is working fine.
The same setup works in 2.6.9-rc2 and backward with the alps patch.
I've mostly exhausted my knowledge. Will be happy for pointers/ideas to
locate the cause.
