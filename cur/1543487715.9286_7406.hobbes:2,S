Compiling with/without SMP doesn't change anything (have only one cpu).  
I spend the last hours to go back the kernel tree. It appears that 
2.1.127 is the first kernel where the stall happens. But it is much
harder to reproduce. I had to play around with different read and
write sizes. So I wouldn't take it for too sure that the bug really
was intoduced with 2.1.127 and not earlier.
