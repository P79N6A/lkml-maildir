    Libc6 is an wad of regrettable design decisions that, fortunately,
    are not yet required to run a Linux kernel.
    Converting dev_t into a 64 bit number (and thus making an earlier
    regrettable design decision -- having the filesystem contain magic
    numbers for device access -- into a regrettable design decision that's
    buttressed by nonstandard GNU constructs) is comparable to putting
    the Mississippi in concrete culvert because it overflowed levees
    that were put up to make the floodplain safe for subdivisions.
