Subject: [PATCH 2.6.19 4/6] tgafb: Fix the mode register setting
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/12/13/161

 There is no need to set the GE bit (Win32 compatibility) in the mode 
register; it shall get cleared with the next subsequent update to the 
register anyway.

---
 The driver uses a number of magic constants throughout.  The hardware is 
fully documented, so my plan is to fix up them all and provide macros for 
all the used bits and perhaps more once I have finished with updating the 
driver.
 Please apply.
