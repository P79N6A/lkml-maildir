I think there is a misunderstanding.
My view was that PLL setting (and setting of a fixed mode) would be done 
in DRM driver. This way it would be able to restore previous settings 
after a lockup or respond to FB request to change modes.
However the decision of which mode to set, as well as where the 
framebuffer is located is done in user-space. (So that subtleties of
layout of offscreen memory are not in the kernel).
Jon - did I understand you correctly ?
