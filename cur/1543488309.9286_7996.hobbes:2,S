    I am interested at being able to use IEEE802.1Q VLAN tagging capable
    switch to supply a large number of separate routing domains to my
    Linux box doing routing.   Although using e.g. cisco WS-2926XL-EN
    to supply such external port multiplexer may at first sound stupid,
    (port prices being around USD 100 with that), you will get very soon
    into state where you can't add enough network cards into your machine
    to do routing in single box anyway, nor much in the staggered lan/box
    setup either.
    Now having a 802.1Q tagged virtual interface layer would be very
    interesting:
         eth0(802.1Q) --- VLAN1: eth0.0001 --- IP AA.BB.1.*
                       |- VLAN2: eth0.0002 --- IP AA.BB.2.*, IPX
                       |- VLAN3: eth0.0003 --- IP AA.BB.3.*, IPV6
		....
    Do note that this is *not* the same as IP-aliases!
    You would do 'ifup' to 'eth0.0001', which is VLAN entity.
