It _is_ functionality for its own sake, because the design of the
capabilities system gives you the tools you need. We will have filesystem
support soon. Once you have that, the solution becomes one of userspace
setup rather than kernel support. Complexity is better in userspace than
the kernel.
We don't want to introduce temporary kernel tweaks between now and such
time as we have filesystem support for capabilities, because then people
will _use_ that support and we could get stuck with it.
Cheers
Chris
