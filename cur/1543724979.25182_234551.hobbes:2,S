Hm. It looks like it gets now even more unclear. If ZONE_NORMAL pages do
not go to swap what goes where, ie on low memory boxes which do not have
HIGHMEM  ?

OOM is better than Lockup but still not good at all.  The problem is
from user standpoint one can control only general memory allocation, the
zones kernel internally is transparent on this level, so if one has OOM
killer or lockup  having allocated just ie 3G out of 4G this just looks
like a bug, well if it is documented I would call it gotcha.

Right.  On other hand whatever performance problem is other class of the
problem than lockups and OOM kills.  Poor performance is much less
critical problem than lockups and firing OOM without good reason,
especially if user has a way to tune kernel to improve performance.
