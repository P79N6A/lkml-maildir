For my humble laptop, I'm still stuck with the 2.0.x kernels due to the fact
that the psaux-device can't be opened for any of the 2.2.x kernels that I tried
(including the very latest 2.2.12final), and neither for 2.3.14pre2.
I'm aware of the problem ever since SuSE6.1 came out and have posted a message
on here before, however, never got an answer ... and the neither is the problem
fixed, alas! :-)
I get the problem both with the stock suse kernel (2.2.5) and with selfcompiled
kernels, and I know that there are also Debian users which have this problem.
However, not all laptops have this problem, as my gf's laptop runs 2.2.x kernels
without a problem!
I made an strace and got the following output:
execve("/bin/cat", ["cat", "/dev/psaux"], [/* 46 vars */]) = 0
[...]
personality(PER_LINUX)                  = 0
getpid()                                = 269
brk(0)                                  = 0x804ba5c
brk(0x804ba94)                          = 0x804ba94
brk(0x804c000)                          = 0x804c000

open("/dev/psaux", O_RDONLY)            = -1 ENOSYS (Function not implemented)
open("/dev/psaux", O_RDONLY)            = -1 ENODEV (Operation not supported by
device)
write(2, "cat: ", 5cat: )                    = 5
write(2, "/dev/psaux", 10/dev/psaux)              = 10
write(2, ": Operation not supported by dev"..., 35: Operation not supported by
device) = 35
write(2, "\n", 1
)                       = 1
close(1)                                = 0
_exit(1)                                = ?
(This strace was made running 2.3.14pre2).
If more info is needed, let me know what is wanted. I'm staying in the UK at the
moment and should be able to find a spare weekend to visit any interested
UK-based Linux hackers with the laptop in question under my arms, so that they
can have a personal look at what's going on :-) In return I can offer to abuse
their kitchen for cooking them a vegetarian dinner (altho, warning, I haven't
had to cook for the last 4 weeks ;-)
Kind regards and Happy Hacking,
--Tim :-)
