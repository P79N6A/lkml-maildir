Subject: [PATCH 0/2] Markers Implementation for RCU Tracing - Ver II
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi Ingo,
	Please accept these patches into the rt tree which convert the
existing RCU tracing mechanism for Preempt RCU and RCU Boost into
markers.
These patches are based upon the 2.6.24-rc5-rt1 kernel tree.
Along with marker transition, the RCU Tracing infrastructure has also
been modularised to be built as a kernel module, thereby enabling
runtime changes to the RCU Tracing infrastructure.
Patch [1/2] - Patch that converts the Preempt RCU tracing in
rcupreempt.c into markers.
Patch [1/2] - Patch that converts the Preempt RCU Boost tracing in
rcupreempt-boost.c into markers.
Thanks,
K.Prasad
