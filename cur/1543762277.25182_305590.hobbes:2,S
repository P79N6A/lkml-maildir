Tom,
Yes, well a cut down version of the kernel module anyway.  Its in the
attached tar ball.  The kernel module requires pagg as well as relayfs
to work.  Basically the module tracks kernel events - in this case
process execs.  
I've tested it on 2.6.10 with the pagg and relayfs patches from
http://www.opersys.com/ftp/pub/relayfs/patch-relayfs-2.6.10-050113
 
and
ftp://oss.sgi.com/projects/pagg/download/linux-2.6.10-pagg.patch-4
read() gives me a zero still once about a page of data has been read.
Many thanks,
