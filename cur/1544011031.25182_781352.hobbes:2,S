2.6.27-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
From: Manfred Spraul <manfred@colorfullife.com>
commit 711a49a07f84f914aac26a52143f6e7526571143 upstream.
The last patch to lib/idr.c caused a bug if idr_get_new_above() was
called on an empty idr.
Usually, nodes stay on the same layer.  New layers are added to the top
of the tree.
The exception is idr_get_new_above() on an empty tree: In this case, the
new root node is first added on layer 0, then moved upwards.  p->layer
was not updated.
As usual: You shall never rely on the source code comments, they will
only mislead you.
