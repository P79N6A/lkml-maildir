Srivatsa, I'm completely new to cpu-hotplug, so please correct me if I'm
wrong (in fact I _hope_ I am wrong) but as I see it, the hotplug/workqueue
interaction is broken by design, it can't be fixed by changing just locking.
Once again. CPU dies, CPU_DEAD calls kthread_stop() and sleeps until
cwq->thread exits. To do so, this thread must at least complete the
currently running work->func().
work->func() calls flush_workque(WQ), it does lock_cpu_hotplug() or
_whatever_. Now the question, does it block?
if YES:
	This is what the stable tree does - deadlock.
if NOT:
	This is what we have with Andrew's s/mutex_lock/preempt_disable/
	patch - race or deadlock, we have a choice.
	Suppose that WQ has pending works on that dead CPU. Note that
	at this point this CPU does not present on cpu_online_map.
	This means that (without other changes) we have lost.
		- flush_workque(WQ) can't return until CPU_DEAD transfers
		  these works to some another CPU on the cpu_online_map.
		- CPU_DEAD can't do take_over_work() untill flush_workque()
		  returns.
Andrew, Ingo, this also means that freezer can't solve this particular
problem either (if i am right).
Thoughts?
Oleg.
