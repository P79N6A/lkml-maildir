Hi,
after creating several GB of data in small files on the SMP highmem box
the
kjournald: page allocation failure. order:1, mode:0x20
start flooding the logs, load goes to sth around 1k, writing processes
get stuck in D state and the system needs hard reset.
Anyone else is experiencing that kind of problems?
Im running sw raid1 on that box, not preemtible kernel.
Krzysztof
