I don't know much about XVideo.
For DRI support, look at:
http://dri.freedesktop.org/wiki/Status?action=highlight&value=CategoryHardware
Many of the cards listed there are a few years old, but several of them
are still available as cheap alternatives in shops.  I had no problem buying
a radeon 9200 and a matrox G550 for example.
Also, the VIA graphichs chips found on current mini-itx motherboards
have both opengl and mpeg2-acceleration.  A mini-itx thing is hardly what
you use as a power desktop machine, but the small size and fanless operation
means they're popular for homemade media player/entertainment boxes.
I got one in my car; mostly for playing CDs and gps navigation. But
it will also play DVDs, play tuxracer using opengl, as well as
the usual web surfing and word processing.
