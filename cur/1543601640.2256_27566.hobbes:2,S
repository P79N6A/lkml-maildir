   That I think is a significant cost.
My own personal feeling, after having tried to implement a much
lighter weight scheme involving "anon areas", is that reverse maps or
something similar should be looked at as a latch ditch effort.
We are tons faster than anyone else in fork/exec/exit precisely
because we keep track of so little state for anonymous pages.
