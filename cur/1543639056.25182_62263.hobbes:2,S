Would that be acceptable for you?  (ok that would not cover ppc32 for 
example, but they may have other issues with the driver)

I don't see it as a that big problem. It just needs a few more negated
generic symbols defined (e.g. CONFIG_32BIT CONFIG_4GB_ONLY 
CONFIG_LITTLE_ENDIAN), then it could be easily expressed with dep_... even 
in the traditional configuration language. I also don't think it would
be particularly unmaintainable to have these things in Config.

They will discover it when they don't find a driver for an device and
can then find the disabled configuration and look into fixing it
(for someone able to fix the driver checking the configuration should
be trivial) 
In my opinion it is just not acceptable when the enable the driver by
mistake or load the wrong module and it crashes.

That will be likely done anyways, but it is not enough.
