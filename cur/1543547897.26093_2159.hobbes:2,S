Gdb stub has been available for quite some time, so the 'no debugger'
argument doesn't fly ;-)  The learning curve _is_ steep, but a debugger
doesn't flatten it one bit.  It's all that conceptual stuff that makes
it so steep, and (drat) debuggers don't have a grok-concept command.

Kdb is available to all.  I think it should be _integrated_ mostly
because of the (potential) improvement in bug report quality.
If it _were_ integrated, more folks would be tempted to rummage around
trying to solve problems by themselves.  Having that resource at your
disposal dares you to make an attempt.. and learn in the process.  It
encourages growth.
