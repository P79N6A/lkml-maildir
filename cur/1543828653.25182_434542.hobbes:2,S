You already have that.  You already stated the mapping of device memory.
The only thing we are asking to do is have a block of device memory
which has its pfn inserted at first touch.  The device is essentially
available on each node.  It is not something the generic parts of the
VM need to manage.  What benefit are we going to get from having
struct page * behind the pages when the struct page need to be marked
as reserved and uncached?
Thanks,
