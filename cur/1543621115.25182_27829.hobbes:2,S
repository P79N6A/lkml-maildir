A module can get displaced as easily as a plain text file, and the wrong
"configutarion module" version won't do any good in any case.
Just teach /sbin/installkernel (or arch/i386/install.sh) to stash it away
somewhere. You'll need to fix arch/i386/Makefile to pass the name of
.config to the script (note that it now takes 3 or 4 arguments, to get
backwards compatibility when taking 3, 4 or 5 will be tricky, unless you
play games with the name of the files passed into it to figure out where
.config lives). Or call a new script  if it is there and only give that one
.config plus the standard stuff.
