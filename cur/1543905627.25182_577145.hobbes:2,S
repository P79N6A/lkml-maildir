Ditto. LRO hw assists (or full LRO offload, meaning that the merge
happens in the ASIC but the merge criteria are set by the host) are
quite beneficial, especially as the number of LRO connections gets very
large (Neterion has IP around fw/hw LRO and will release full hw LRO
offload in the next ASIC), but as Andrew indicated sw-only LRO
implementation can be done for any NIC and provides good results -
especially for non-jumbo workloads.
