   Fine if you don't mind an indirect function call pointer somewhere in the TCP
   hash path.
The hashes are sized at boot time, we can just reduce
the size when the boot time option says "small machine"
or whatever.
Why in the world do we need indirection function call pointers
in TCP to handle that?
Franks a lot,
