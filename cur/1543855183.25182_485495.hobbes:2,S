One more reason to perform more code reviews helped with automated tools.
We found this one and the rio's one while discussing with Jean Delvare
about such bugs, and firing a random grep to illustrate how easy it could
be to spot bugs similar to Alexey's "&&" instead of "&" ...
I think that we should at least take a look at all lines in the pre-processed
code having both '!' and '&' on the same line. There are a lot of them, but
divided by a sufficient number of volunteers, we might catch a bunch of them.
BTW, has anyone a good idea on how to make gcc dump the preprocessed files
for everything it builds ? I mean, just by changing some variables in the
Makefile.
