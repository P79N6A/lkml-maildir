I thought of that about five minutes after I hit 'send'.
I have a feeling that there might still be a few cases
not perfectly covered by the strict overcommit patch.
Say, memory allocations due to incoming network traffic.
I guess if memory runs out during incoming traffic, the kernel
should simply drop the traffic.  Until all those situations
are nicely ironed out, there's still some chance the OOM killer
might run even on a strict overcommit system.
But enough talking; I need to go try it.
