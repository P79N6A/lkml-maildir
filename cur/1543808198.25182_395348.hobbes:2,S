Hmm... I don't think the semantics of cpu_possible_map allow to change it.
Also any code that uses for_each_cpu() may allocate memory _before_
cpu_possible_map is changed back to reflect a smaller number of cpus.
Doesn't look like the correct way to fix this.
Thinking a bit longer this was probably a reason why initialization of
this map was done in smp_prepare_cpus() before it silently moved to
setup_arch().
