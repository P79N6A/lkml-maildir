Well, my one remaining child said today that "I got so much time on 
webkinz today - yesterday the mouse locked up after five minutes".
Apparently it hadn't had the mouse lock up at all today.
So I really do believe that that 196705c9bb commit caused problems on 
intel-only USB machines too ("ondemand" cpufreq governor, switching 
between 1.0-1.66 Ghz using acpi-cpufreq: totally bog-standard in all 
respects, in other words).
