That's a _really_ naive statement, that proves you haven't even looked 
at what you are talking about.
The currently released RHAS is based off 2.4.9, with a lot of tweaks 
specifically for the VM/VFS layer as it existed at that time. 
(Remember, the VM was basically replaced in 2.4.10)  That's a totally 
dead end branch (from a mainline perspective) with very little mergeable 
worth.
Still, if you want to create a "2.4-features++" branch, I think that 
there is value there.  Just PLEASE don't put the junk in mainline.

That's no excuse for sloppiness in 2.4.

I agree that we are disagreeing about what should be mainline 2.4 :)
"People are shipping it, so it must be good" is the proverbial 
road-to-hell-paved-with-good-intentions.
