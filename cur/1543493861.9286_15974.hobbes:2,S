Not easily. If you know roughly where things line up you can hunt for the
unix superblocks and FAT tables. Keeping a copy of your partition tables
on postits taped to the case isnt a bad idea. Its a bit late for that
though.
If you set one partition for the whole disk, that should let you back up the
first partition you had at least. It may also let you know a size so you can
hunt the next one
