Well of course that's not a concern for people who work against the git
trees - scsi/usb/ia64/whatever developers.
But yes, sometimes people's work does clash just too much with things which
are already in subsystem trees or in -mm.  Fortunately it's relatively
rare, and I do think it's best to ask people to develop against latest
-linus rather than against a crazy -mmoving target.
Especially as lots of people are stuck using git, rather than high-tech
patch management technologies ;)
Actually, I disagree with you - it's at 2.6.x release-time that all trees,
including -mm are at their most divergent.  Presumably these developers are
working against the relevant subsystem git tree, and hence can merge into
the subsystem maintainer at any time.
