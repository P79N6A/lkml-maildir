There are four versions of this that I know of. They come from 
MontaVista, LynuxWorks, Ziatech, and myself. Mine is based on code 
originally written for ARM by Mark van Doesburg, and ported to PowerPC 
by myself. This is probably what you know from the Strongarm Beowulf 
project. I made quite large changes, which haven't been completely 
ported back to ARM. I also added a console over PCI, to avoid the need 
for a serial cable to each plug-in card. This code is available as a 
patch for 2.2 kernels at:
