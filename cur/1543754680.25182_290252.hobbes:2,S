Don't forget the comment (it's still there in 2.6) :-)

Neither do we. :-)
I just found it when trying to figure out if the kernel actually used
any of the rlimits and if so how.

Since we don't use it i can't really test it, but a visual inspection is
good enough in this simple case. And since this is the only place in 2.4
that RLIMIT_RSS is used, the problem is solved.
BTW do you know if there is any plans for 2.6++ to actually use
RLIMIT_RSS? I saw a hint in that direction in mm/thrash.c
grab_swap_token but it is commented out and only skeleton code...
I'm asking since the above code piece has been removed.
