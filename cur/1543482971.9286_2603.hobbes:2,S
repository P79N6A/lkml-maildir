I   believe   that  serial   interrupts   have   never  been   reported   in
/proc/interrupt,  unless the  serial port  is  actually being  used by  some
application. As far as I can remember, this is not a new behavior for 2.2.0
If  you open  the serial  port with  minicom or  such, you  should see  your
interrupt.
