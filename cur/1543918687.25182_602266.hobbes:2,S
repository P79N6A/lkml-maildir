He said he was using software floating point which from a kernel perspective
really just is integer stuff anyway.
Hardware floating point in a MIPS kernel would be require solving a few
interesting problems; the kernel floating point assist software is only
designed to support userspace.  Or alternativle well written FP code
that avoids all the corner cases which would normally be handled by the
kernel fp software.
The biggest argument against floating point use in the kernel is that most
of the time it's an indicator for poor division of work between kernel
and userspace.
