Why bother ?
In most places where we update mm->rss, we are *already*
holding the spinlock anyway, this correction is just for
a few places.
The big patch Rasmus made seems to contain spin_lock(&foo)
in places where we already have the lock, leading to
instant SMP deadlock. I suspect Rasmus' patch should be
about half the size it is currently...

Rik
