Well, there's the thing with RAW IO being done into a
process' address space and the data arriving only after
the page gets unmapped from the process.
Then you have the RAW IO data in a swapcache page, but
the VM doesn't know how to swap it out and the page
becomes either unswappable or the data gets lost
(depending on at which stage the page is at that
moment).
But granted, this probably isn't a show-stopper for
most people and -since the fix has to support NFS
too, with its credentials stuff- a fix isn't even
underway yet...

Lets just hope he doesn't need RAW IO ;)
cheers,
