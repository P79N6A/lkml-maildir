I know Rik have some plans but I don't know the time table.
On the other hand do you really need swap partitions how about using swap
files? That way you don't need to manage alot of partitons and you can test if
you really do need to go all the way to 2xRAM. It dose look a bit silly to have
16GB swap. Are you really going to load the machine with work that needs more
than 8GB?? if not you don't really need any swap.
I have not created any swap partitons in years and mostly run without any swap
whatsoever. It's easy to create one temporary if I know I'am going to use more
memory than I have. Obviously on a server it's better to be safe than sorry.
