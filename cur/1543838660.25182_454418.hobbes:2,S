Why not have another system call for getting the current limits?
But as I said in previous mail, configfs seems like a better choice for
user interface.  That way user has to go to one place to read/write
limits, see the current usage and other stats.

I think there should be a check here for seeing if the new limits are
lower than the current usage of a resource.  If so then take appropriate
action.
