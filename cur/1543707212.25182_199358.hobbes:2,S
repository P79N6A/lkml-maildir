Subject: Linux 2.6.3-rc4 Massive strange corruption with new radeonfb

Upon bootup, radeonfb is obviously not initializing the hardware 
correctly.  Massive amounts of random-looking garbage, plus a weird 
effect I've never seen before, like someone pouring milk _up_ the
screen. (Yeah, it's the best I could come up with)
It's a Dell Inspiron 8600 with Mobile Radeon 9600 and 1920x1200 LCD.
Here's the relevant parts from dmesg:
radeonfb_pci_register BEGIN
radeonfb: probed SDR SGRAM 131072k videoram
radeonfb: mapped 16384k videoram

Obviously, it isn't detecting the screen size properly.  I even tried 
hard-coding the resolution in the detection code, to no avail.
Any suggestions?
Thanks.
