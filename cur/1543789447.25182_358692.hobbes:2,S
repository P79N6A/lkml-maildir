Maybe because nobody understood your description ;)

The patch is of course pretty unwelcome: lots of weird stuff in the core
VFS which everyone has to maintain but probably will not test.
So I think we need a better understanding of what the locking inversion
problem is, so we can perhaps find a better solution.  Bear in mind that
ext3 has (rare, unsolved) lock inversion problems in this area as well, so
commonality will be sought for.

"active pages in the page cache" means present pagecache pages in the node
which holds pages in its pagecache, yes?

So where is the lock inversion?
Perhaps if you were to cook up one of those little threadA/threadB ascii
diagrams we could see where the inversion occurs?
