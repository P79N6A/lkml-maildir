Yes of course :
[   44.013100] NET: Registered protocol family 16                               
[   44.066308] geode-mfgpt:  IRQ MSR=0:0                                        
[   44.110161] geode-mfgpt:  NMI MSR=0:0                                        
[   44.154037] geode-mfgpt:  Unrestricted sources=0                             
Then it hangs here.
In another mail I sent privately to Andres, I noticed that it was the
following line which hangs at first iteration (i == 0) :
                val = geode_mfgpt_read(i, MFGPT_REG_SETUP);
I have a tinybios 0.98 with no workaround option configurable. I also
have CONFIG_GEODE_MFGPT_TIMER=n.
Hoping this helps,
Willy
