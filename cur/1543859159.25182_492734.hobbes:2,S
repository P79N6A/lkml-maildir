Just evil suggestion, but if you contact someone else than HP, they
might be _very_ interested in taking HP's place and providing whatever
you need to get their name on www.kernel.org. Sun and IBM do such
monter machines too. That would not be very kind to HP, but it might
help getting hardware faster.

Couldn't we disable gitweb for as long as we don't get newer machines ?
I've been using it in the past, but it was just a convenience. If needed,
we can explode all the recent patches with a "git-format-patch -k -m" in a
directory.

I did not imagine FTP and rsync being so much used !

BTW, yesterday my 2.4 patches were not published, but I noticed that
they were not even signed not bziped on hera. At first I simply thought
it was related, but right now I have a doubt. Maybe the automatic script
has been temporarily been disabled on hera too ?
