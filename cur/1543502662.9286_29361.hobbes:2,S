Pop over to linux-ha; Johnnie Peters from Motorola just posted a set of
patches Motorola used for their demo of PCI hot-swap at Linux Expo:
http://www.progressive-comp.com/Lists/?l=linux-ha&m=93190413829205&w=2
and
http://www.progressive-comp.com/Lists/?l=linux-ha&m=93190689531692&w=2
...and the list in general:
http://www.progressive-comp.com/Lists/?l=linux-ha&r=1&w=2#linux-ha
He's not very specific about what the current patch set supports, just
"this is what we used for our hot-swap demo".  As I've been living under a
rock lately I don't know if that demo included just swapping PCI cards, or
CPUs as well (I doubt it, tho).
