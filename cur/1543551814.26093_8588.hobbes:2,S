You are correct that in C the rightmost argument is always
at the open end of the stack, and that varargs require that.
The opposite is called the Pascal convention.
This thread has incorrectly identified the order of
expression evaluation with the physical stack layout of the
resulting values. The two properties are orthogonal. The
compiler is free to evaluate arguments in any order, and
knows which stack slot gets each result.
For instance, evaluation reordering might be done to
optimize cache coherency. It is conceivable that a SMP-aware
compiler would evaluate heavyweight arguments in parallel
(though currently Linux would not support that).
