AFAIK noone has even tested it yet to see what it does to performance! Eg
it might slow down memory access so that athlon-optimized memcopy is now
slower than non-athlon-optimized memcopy. And if it turns out to be the
case, we might as well just use the non-athlon-optimized memcopy instead
of twiddling undocumented northbridge bits...
