FWIW, Dave & I did some testing/debugging on 32-bit powerpc, and it is
indeed only xfs_lowbit64 which is doing the wrong thing on that arch,
because generic find_next_bit is doing the wrong thing on big-endian
32-bit systems, for sizes > 32 bits, near as I can tell.
Rather than reverting it all, I think just changing xfs_lowbit64 back to:
int
xfs_lowbit64(
       __uint64_t      v)
{
       __uint32_t      w = (__uint32_t)v;
       int             n = 0;
       if (w) {        /* lower bits */
               n = ffs(w);
       } else {        /* upper bits */
               w = (__uint32_t)(v >> 32);
               if (w && (n = ffs(w)))
                       n += 32;
       }
       return n - 1;
}
for now should fix it (this is essentially just ffs64())
