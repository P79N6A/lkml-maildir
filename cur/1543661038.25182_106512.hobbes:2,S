cPCI hotswap as defined in the PICMG 2.1 specification is a different 
beast from PCMCIA because it was purposely defined to give software a 
chance to do something before the device disappears.  The specification
even goes so far as to say that the system is in an undefined state if
a device is yanked without waiting for the system software indicating it
is safe to do so.  In reality, handling someone yanking a board is indeed 
desireable, although it seems unlikely that the vast array of PCI device
drivers will ever get updated to handle it.
