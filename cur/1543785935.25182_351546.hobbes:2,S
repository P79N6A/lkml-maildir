XFS does have a nice feature set, sure.  So does Reiser4.
XFS can "freeze" the filesystem, take a live snapshot, and do some 
other, similar tricks.  Reiser4 can show file metadata as files 
themselves, compress on-the-fly (last I checked, the compression code is 
in there, just not being used), and pack small files incredibly well.
XFS has xattrs.  Reiser has metas, and will eventually provide an xattr 
interface to them.
You may not value Reiser's feature set, but that doesn't make it less 
complex.  Romfs is actually simpler than ext2, and its whole "feature" 
seems to be having a tiny implementation.
