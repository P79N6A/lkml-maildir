To the contrary, I believe my original message to you was pretty neutral. I
even took great care not to be offensive.  I however stated some _facts_
which aren't coherent with your credit/naming policy so you could clarify
them.  You instead chose to qualify the core of my mail as unfriendly and
avoided the issue altogether.

At least you might have avoided the bad one.

I was one of them, but since you chose to qualify most of my points as not
"worth responding" since they challenge your agenda, I can only conclude
that it's not possible to have a reasonable conversation with this
narrow-minded attitude of yours.
Someone else replied to my original mail in private.  We agreed to disagree
after some really interesting exchanges, yet I didn't lose any respect for
that person at all.
