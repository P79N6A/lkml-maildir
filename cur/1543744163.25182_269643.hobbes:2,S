Actually I needed it to respond to CTS going away, and it provides a
notification *before* the data are *sent*. Which lets me know that the
first bytes of my packet were dropped by the automatic contention
detection circuitry and I need to flush the rest of the packet from the
FIFO rather than letting the hardware driver wait for CTS to come back
then then send a corrupt half-packet.

That solves a different problem, and isn't quite as useful to me. I want
to be able to respond to CTS going low as quickly as possible, by
flushing the rest of the characters from the outgoing queue. I was happy
enough with using a tasklet to actually call the flush method, to avoid
the deadlock you pointed out without changing the locking of all the
hardware drivers).

I'll submit the bit which makes the flush_buffer method work on its own.
Alan, would you care to offer a viable alternative which solves the
problem I'm interested in?
