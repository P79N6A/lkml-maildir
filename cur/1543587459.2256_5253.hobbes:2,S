Hi,
Upgraded to ac5 tonight.  Problems with 8139too.o
caused a few crashes and scrambled a few files.
Restoring them was fun.  Seems that while ide-tape
can write to my 'HP Colorado 20G' drive, it gets
an I/O error when it trys to read...  If I flip to 
ide-scsi and friends (much slower for backups btw)
the restore works.
What is needed to debug this?
