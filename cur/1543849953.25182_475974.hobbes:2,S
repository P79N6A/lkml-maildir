Heh, OK. I'll look at that. Thanks.

Er, yes. The whole point in this is so we can standardise on a proper
battery API. I'm only really supposed to be adding support for the
battery on the $100 laptop, but I just couldn't bring myself to do yet
another different battery driver without trying to bring in some sanity.
I sincerely hope that those responsible for the various other different
userspace interfaces for PMU, ACPI, etc. are all hanging their heads in
shame at this point :)
