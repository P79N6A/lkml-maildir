If all accesses to the spinlock are taken under a semaphore, then the
spinlock is not needed (i.e. the down'ed semaphore provides the same
protection), or am I missing something?
If this is not the case - e.g. there are other accesses to these locks -
then you cannot sleep, no?
I really can think of no case in which it is safe to sleep while holding
a spinlock or otherwise atomic.  If it is, then the atomicity is not
needed, sort of by definition.
