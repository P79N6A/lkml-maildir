I see the above case will be not handled right by the logic I was
proposing, but I don't see how kpiod is helping that case right now.
write(fd, buff-in-swap, 1giga) will down() the inode->i_sem, then kpiod
will remains stuck until the write will finish. This doesn't only mean
that kpiod won't be able to flush out anything from the shared mapping,
but it also means kpiod won't be able to write out anything also from
other shared mappings that could be instead flushed, while with my logic
we could at least flush dirty pages form the other mappings.
Implementing the testcase you described above looks very worty.

Of course. I was thinking at the worst case, for ext2 it should be trivial
for example (just a current->fs_locks++ together with down(&i_sem) and
embedded in lock_super should be enough to support the new logic).

What do you mean exactly with "disabling file reap"?
