Actually my understanding is that __attribute_used__ is intended for
exactly that: to let the compiler know that something that is
apparently unused by the C code is actually used by inline assembly.
I'm sure your solution is fine as well but I think this type of
situation is exactly what __attribute_used__ is for.  For example it
is attached to the modversions ____versions array so that it is not
discarded by the compiler.
Best,
