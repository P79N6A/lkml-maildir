Extra architecture support added to release 2.4:
  kbuild-2.5-ppc-2.5.14-1.bz2 from Paul Mackerras
  kbuild-2.5-sparc64-2.5.14-1.bz2 from Tom Duffy
  kbuild-2.5-sh-2.5.12-1.bz2 from Greg Banks
  Read the start of each patch for special instructions.
kbuild-2.5-core-12.bz2 added to release 2.4
  Changes from core-11.
    Verify that KBUILD_OBJTREE points to an objtree directory during
    make clean/mrproper.  Old object trees will get a warning,
      echo "must not be empty" > $KBUILD_OBJTREE/_objtree
    to mark old objtrees, only needed once.
    Change message when switching from normal mode to NO_MAKEFILE_GEN
    mode, document why the switch requires additional processing.
    Fix standardization of file names in commands.
    pp_ programs are compiled with -O2 -NDEBUG=1.
    Tune database layout to improve speed, especially for small builds.
    The new database format requires and will force a complete rebuild.
