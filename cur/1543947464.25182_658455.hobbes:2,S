Subject: [PATCH spelling] Tighten up the use of loose
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/22/571

'Lose' is when you don't win or you've lost something, and 'loose'
is when something isn't tight. I just want to tighten up the
spelling a bit regarding some loose comments.

Yes, this is a digression.
