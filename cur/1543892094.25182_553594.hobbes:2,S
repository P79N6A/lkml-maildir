But with the patch the process would be able to terminate. There is no 
global OOM situation. If there would be a global OOM situation then 
TIF_MEMDIE would not help.

So its seems that the patch is addressing an imagined situation?
I think the allocation outside of our mems_allowed is fine when it serves 
to terminate the process and thereby release resources. It is certainly 
better than having the process corrupt data by only partially writing back 
its data.
