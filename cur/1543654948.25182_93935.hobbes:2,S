Subject: Why does the Comtrol Rocketport card not have a major assigned?

Perhaps it's a silly question but I'd like to know why it is the way it 
is:
The 2.2, 2.4 and 2.5 kernels include a driver for the Comtrol Rocketport 
card (drivers/char/dtlk.c) which uses a local major (it does a
  "register_chrdev(0, "dtlk", &dtlk_fops);
). Is there a reason why it doesn't have a fixed major assigned?
TIA
Adrian
