Is needed for WARN_CONSOLE_UNLOCKED().
It just happens that WARN_CONSOLE_UNLOCKED() is currently only using in
vt.c, which just happens to not support modular usage.
But disabling this export would make WARN_CONSOLE_UNLOCKED() pretty useless
for driver development.
So I'd suggest that we either leave this symbol exported for driver
developers or we nuke WARN_CONSOLE_UNLOCKED() altogether.
Ben, do you still want it?
