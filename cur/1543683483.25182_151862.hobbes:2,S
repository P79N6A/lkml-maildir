Forgive me for answering your question with a question, but, wouldn't 
you want to do it at the block device layer?  If no, then it would not 
be hard to code a block allocation plugin for it.  Probably the main 
problem would be with the super block and bitmaps, which have fixed 
locations (and are written twice but we don't normally care because they 
are small and insignificant to performance.)

0, but an application can still write to two files, and if it does not 
use our atomic infrastructure (at this time none of them do;-) ), the 
two separate files will not be certain to be updated as one atom atomically.

I don't have numbers, someone else will have to answer/measure it for you.
