Yeah, I'm having the same troubles. Carefully watching the iwconfig
results showed me that only half of the time did my `iwconfig eth1 essid
AccessPointName` actually take. (It listed the essid of the ap I told it
to associate with, but then showed "Access Point: Invalid" or words to
that effect, until I issued the exact same iwconfig again.)
So, try it twice, double check the iwconfig output, then try bringing up
the interface. Though that seems awfully difficult to do as well (DHCP
is just sending out stuff with nothing coming back).
When I switch consoles while DHCP is plaintively asking for an IP, and
issue *another* iwconfig with the same essid, then it seems to kick
something in the driver and DHCP immediately associates. Happened twice
for me so far, though that could merely be a coincidence.
