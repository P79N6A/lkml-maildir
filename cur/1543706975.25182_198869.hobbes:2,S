You mean beacause the caller can block and this affects other devices
with free requests too. Hmm.

I have to call queue_work with a work_struct. queue_work will most
likely be called from interrupt context. The bio will be decrypted on
the same cpu as the interrupt occurs. If the driver returns a bunch of
bio's at once they would all be decrypted on the same cpu sequentally.
So it depends on the irq balancing.
What could be done (probably not with work queues) is: If there is a bio
to decrypt the end_io handler finds a free cpu (empty queue) and puts
the bio there. Another possibility: If there is work it gets just added
to a global list and all threads on all cpu's get fired. The fastest one
will pick a bio, the next one the second... monster cache trashing? I
don't know.
