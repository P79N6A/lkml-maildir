Ok. I thought if overriding MP tables works in SMP case then it should work
in UP case too. But anyway, here is the take2. This one is little ugly and
hackish but limits the impact to only UP kernels and that too if CRASH_DUMP
is enabled. 
o Kdump second kernel boot fails after a system crash if second kernel
  is UP and acpi=off and if crash occurred on a non-boot cpu. 
o Issue here is that MP tables report boot cpu lapic id as 0 but second
  kernel is booting on a different processor and MP table data is stale
  in this context. Hence apic_id_registered() check fails in setup_local_APIC()
  when called from APIC_init_uniprocessor(). 
o Problem is not seen if ACPI is enabled as in that case
  boot_cpu_physical_apicid is read from the LAPIC.
o Problem is not seen with SMP kernels as well because in this case also
  boot_cpu_physical_apicid is read from LAPIC. (smp_boot_cpus()).
o The problem is fixed by reading boot_cpu_physical_apicid from LAPIC 
  if it is a UP kernel and CRASH_DUMP is enabled.
