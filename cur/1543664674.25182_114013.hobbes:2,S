I'm not sure that it would because we don't know how much compression
we're going to get ahead of time, so we don't know how many extra pages
we can save. The compression/decompression also takes extra time and
puts more drain on a potentially low battery.
I suppose it could be included as an option if it was going to already
be there for LKCD anyway, but I'm not sure it would be helpful for the
usual use of swsusp.

Nigel
