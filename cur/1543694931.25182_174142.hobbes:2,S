As I noted elsewhere, this depends on the past being a predictor of the
future. I don't think we will see a major improvement in behaviour until
disk, CPU, and VM management are all integrated. Given that the
implementors don't agree on any one part of this I find that unlikely.
At least the scheduler folks are all civil and acknowledge the good
points of all work, resulting in progress even thought they are taking
different approaches. With that model perhaps integration of all
resource managers would be possible.
On the other hand... the pissing contest with suspend makes good soap
opera, but does not seem to have resulted in even one widely functional
implementation. The phrase "does not play well with others" comes to
mind.
