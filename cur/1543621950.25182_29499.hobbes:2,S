I agree (not just because Stelian mentioned my script ;-).  To burden
bkbits.net or any other site to keep a BK repository online just to
submit a trivial change from an occasional contributor is too much.
BK can easily handle CSETs sent inline with the mail, and if Linus 
has the original email saying "pull from here" it could just as well
have a small CSET attached at the end.  Proposed wording:
	For occasional contributors who want to use BK, it is possible
	to send a BK changeset directly in the mail.  In order to make
	it easier to view what is in the changeset, you need to include
	a good description of the change (as always) and both a unified
	diff and the changeset.  Since the unified diff is the readable
	part of the message, it makes sense to make the BK changeset part
	as small as possible.  This can be done by using one of the BK
	wrappers when generating the changeset.  For example:
	To: <maintainer>
	Subject: [PATCH] fixes to FAT filesystem detection
	This change fixes the FAT filesystem code so that it does not
	break when we try to mount something that isn't a FAT filesystem.
	You can import this changeset into BK by piping this whole message to
	'bk receive [path to repository]' or apply the patch as usual.
	=================================================================
	<changeset comment: 'bk changes -r<rev>'>
	<patch summary: 'bk export -t patch -du -h -r<rev> | diffstat'>
	<unified diff: 'bk export -t patch -du -h -r<rev>'>
	=================================================================
	<compressed changeset: 'bk send -wgzip_uu -r<rev> -'>
(this may become part of BK itself so at that time we can just say "use
'bk send -linus -r<rev>' to format the output".
New version of script which includes diffstat output below.
Cheers, Andreas
