Hello,
I am just wondering if anyone thinks the same way.  I am thinking 
about going to BSD for good because of these things.
Linux is starting to include code written under non-disclosure 
agreements and other nasties, and for me this kills the magic of 
Linux.  Doesn't stop anyone from reading the code, but it's the 
principle that counts.
I don't know.  I feel Linux has lost the plot.  It's supposed to be 
getting bigger and better (well, at least bigger -- to borrow words 
from Andy Tanenbaum.  He was referring to the onslaught of 
"improvements" to Minix being submitted, but now this applies to 
Linux as well.)
True, there are lots of nice improvements and binary only drivers 
cannot use ksysms, so I've read somewhere.  (True?  Nice.)  But NDAs?  
Come on, where do you get off on that?
End rant.
Thanks,
James
