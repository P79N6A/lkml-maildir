It should be safe.

fbset -a .... Switching with noaccel takes longer time, so it happenned
sooner. There is almost sure something trying to reenter console subsystem 
on your machine.

If you are using fastfont, there is no need for noaccel.

Probably not. I was thinking about some apps like I'm running - teletext
grabber which continously displays received stream, top running with
zero delay (but top spends tons of time reading proc, so it does not count)
or running DataFlex 2.0 engine for SCO displaying menu (it sends cursor
move at full speed).

Hm, there is patch for console reentering during scrollback (used by
SuSE and I did not hear complaints (*)) - did you shift-pageup & console 
switch together? Patch can be downloaded from 
ftp://vana.vc.cvut.cz/private/fbdev/consolefix.diff.gz.
 It is from
June 22, 1999, so it will apply with some offset, probably.
It adds disable_bh/enable_bh around cursor operations, as since
softscrollback patches these operations can do putc/putcs for repainting
whole screen. If you switch console during that... (video=scrollback:0
is alternate solution).

Ok.

There is no need if it crashed without X.

(*) I did not sent it to Alan because of I observed lockups in dualhead
system with that patch. Now, when reason for lockup was found in
fbcon_softback_note, I should try to resend it to Alan...
