Our group ran into this problem last summer while we were developing the
Oasis+ DSM system.  We worked around it by utilizing the following code
fragment:
void fault_handler(int sig, siginfo_t *sip, ucontext_t *ucp)
{
	void *addr;
	addr = (void *) ucp->uc_mcontext.cr2;
	...
}
Hope that helps.
Regards,
David
