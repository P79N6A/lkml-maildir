Please don't read into what I wrote.
I didn't say "URB's shouldn't go in before 2.4". I said "I don't think
the code is ready yet".
What that means is that I think both a) the design has a couple of
(relatively minor) issues that need to be ironed out and b) the
implementation has issues that need to be ironed out.
Right now, the current code in the kernel is more stable than the URB
code you have submitted. I don't think there are any issues that can't
be overcome, but I'd like to fix the big problems first before they go
into the kernel.
