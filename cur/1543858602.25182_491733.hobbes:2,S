No, the 8-character indents are made of one ASCII TAB character.

That's usually (preferably) done with tab(s).  Sometimes it is done
with a few spaces instead.  (and we put up with it :)

I take [1] to mean that this example:
	if (condition) do_this;
	  do_something_everytime;
is broken in at least 3 ways:
1/ do_this(); should be on a separate line;
2/ do_something_everytime() should not be indented more than the "if"
	above it; and
3/ *if* do_something_everytime() were to be indented more than it is,
	it should be done with a tab, not spaces.
