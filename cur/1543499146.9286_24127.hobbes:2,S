I disagree. Have a look:
[root@bucephalus /root]# hdparm -tT /dev/md0
/dev/md0:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  0.96 seconds =133.33 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  2.97 seconds =21.55 MB/sec
[root@bucephalus /root]# killall rc5des
[root@bucephalus /root]# hdparm -tT /dev/md0
/dev/md0:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  0.93 seconds =137.63 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  2.95 seconds =21.69 MB/sec
Yes, the results without rc5des are a bit higher, but not that much.
I'm running two Maxtor DiamondMax 8.4 GB disk in RAID0 setup, each
one on it's own IDE controller. Doing a 'dd if=/dev/md0 of=/dev/null
bs=4096' gives an average transferrate of about 21 MB/sec with 26%
CPU use.
Btw. This box is sitting beside my desk, has lots of memory (>256M)
and is doing absolutely nothing (apart from running rc5des).
My $.02,
Mathijs
