If people didn't use email clients, but rather a patch sending script,
it would work better.  It is easier to send patch sets this way (you get
to edit all the vital fields, such as Subject, To and Cc lists, in your
favorite text editor), and the usual failures that mess up patch
sending are avoided.
The script I'm using is in good shape, and several others besides
myself are successfully using it to send patches to lkml.
See the embedded Usage string for documentation.

It handles sending one or several related patches, to a list of email
addresses.  You prepare a text directive file with the addresses,
subjects and pathnames to the files containing the message contents.
Then you send it all off with a single invocation of this 'sendpatchset'
script.
