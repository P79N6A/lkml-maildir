Greg is electing new official maintainers, but Greg is doing other
weird things as well:

I'm certainly not happy with you as an official maintainer of a kernel
that could potentially be used by lot of people (I say potentially
because I doubt many would use it) given that recently you claimed to
be happy with ext2, and you discredited the great work of many people
that are testing new features and reporting feedback. I also don't
trust you to act in the interest of all parties involved in the kernel
community (given that most of them are funded by companies filing lots
of US software patents). I don't need to comment on your signature
since that's explicit enough without me needing to add anything.
