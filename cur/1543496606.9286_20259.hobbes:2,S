Maybe we should look into the "overlay" functionality of the S3 cards. The
Virge definitely has it, not sure about Trio64.
The overlay functionality lets you lay one screen over another (with black
behaving as transparent in the top layer). It is done in hardware. The
colours and resolution are limited when using this feature though
