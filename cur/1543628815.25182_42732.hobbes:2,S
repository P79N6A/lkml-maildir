The behavior you originally described, and the bootup output (where the 
kernel reports the CPUs as XPs) might indicate you're really running XPs.
Especially the part where the system runs fine when only 1 CPU is 
installed. That's what a lot of XP users report.
I know you checked the box, but maybe to be sure you can emove the heatsink 
(make sure you have spare thermal compound handy for when you replace it) 
and check on the core, is it a 1900XP or 1900MP.
I have several Tyan 2466N and 2466N-4M and all report the CPUs as 1900+ MPs 
when the kernel boots.
Another user reported stability issues that turned out to be his MP CPUs. 
He was able to move them to other motherboards and cause the stability 
problems. In the end he had to swap CPUs. I'll ask him to email you 
directly perhaps he can help. He has your motherboard as well.
