i have an MSI K7N2, the original NFORCE2
chipset that doesn't do over 200MHz FSB,
running an overclocked Barton 2500 at
195MHz FSB, on 1Gig RAM.
These patches have worked for me.  At
apic_tack=2 been up for close to two days
running the kind of load that before would
lock up the box in less than an hour.
So nice to have a reliable box again.
Season's Greetings; many thanks,
