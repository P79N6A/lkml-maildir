10 gige becomes more of an interesting beast. Not sure if we would see
servers with 10gige real soon now. Your proposal does make sense although
compute power would still be a player. I think the key would be
parallelization;
Now if it wasnt for the stupid way TCP options were designed
you could easily do remote DMA instead. Would be relatively easy to add
NIC support for that. Maybe SCTP would save us ;-> however, if history
could be used to predict the future, i think TCP will continue to be
"hacked" and fit the throughput requirements so no chance for SCTP to be
a big player i am afraid .
cheers,
jamal
