I think I've isolated the problem child: MSI's Dynamic Overclocking features...
The MSI "Core Cell" chipset will modify the CPU frequency within
certain parameters as the CPU needs more oomph (like a kernel
recompile :^P ), but will drop it once it heats up or things become
"unstable" or the CPU is getting idle again.
What I still need to ascertain, is whether the MSI K8N Neo Platinum
(nForce2 250) *do* have a HPET implementation or not, as my timer.c
only reports a PIT timer :(
