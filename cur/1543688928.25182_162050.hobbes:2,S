Hi!
If I try to compile latest kernel with "make C=1" I'll get many warning
messages from sparse saying:
warning: include/linux/bitmap.h:85:2: bad constant expression
warning: include/linux/bitmap.h:98:2: bad constant expression
Sparse doesn't seem to like DECLARE_BITMAP macros.
#define DECLARE_BITMAP(name,bits) \
        unsigned long name[BITS_TO_LONGS(bits)]
So what is wrong with this and how it could be fixed so that sparse
wouldn't complain?
Best regards,
Petri Koistinen
