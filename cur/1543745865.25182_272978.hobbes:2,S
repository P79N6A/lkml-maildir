That's a pretty serious issue and the one that actually compelled work
to be done on remap_pfn_range(), though it was known to be an issue
for other reasons sufficiently compelling for mainline inclusion in
isolation. You might say that the "ulterior motive" on my part with
remap_pfn_range() was to ultimately leverage it to help resolve the
io_remap_page_range() issue though it directly benefits ia32 and ppc440.
A bit of research is needed to deal with the six-argument variants for
that effort that hasn't been wrapped up yet, and that's really the only
thing holding back the io_remap_pfn_range() sweep to unify the 5 and 6
argument conventions. I do have the hardware to test the 6 argument
architectures, which should make testing easy once I dredge up the info.
