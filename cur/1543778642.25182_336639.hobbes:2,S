What about having a small static array of security blob pointers for the 
common case (e.g. SELinux + capabilities + perhaps something else), the 
total number of which is compile-time configurable.  Reserve one pointer 
at the end for the hlist.
When a module registers with stacker, if there's room in the array, it 
reserves a slot for the module.  This slot value can be stored by stacker 
in a handle held by the module (along with the stacker ID etc. perhaps).
Calls to security_get_value() etc. can then be very fast and simple for 
the common case, where the security blob is a pointer offset by an index 
in a small array.  The arbitrarily sized hlist would then be a fallback 
with a higher performance hit.
