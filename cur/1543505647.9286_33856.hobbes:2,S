>i assume you're looking at a late 2.3 kernel?  :)
Err, yes, 2.3.12 and 2.3.13 (I think). I'm away from my machine at the
moment so I can't check, but I was using whatever was current when I posted
the message. The simplest option seemed to be to stick a
if (!new_page)
    new_page = page_cache_alloc();
just before we attempt to copy to new_page, but I was wondering if we could
overlap the page allocation for new_page and the previous ->readpage()..
