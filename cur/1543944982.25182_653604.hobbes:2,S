There is a much more interesting 'problem' with a "/dev/null directory".
Q: Why would you need such a directory?
A: To temporarily fool a program into believing it wrote something.
Q: Should all files disappear? (e.g. "unlink after open")
A: Maybe not, programs may stat() the file right afterwards and
   get confused by the "inexistence".
Q: What if a program attempts to mkdir /dev/nullmnt/foo to just
   create a file /dev/nullmnt/foo/barfile?
A: /dev/nullmnt/foo must continue to exist or be accepted for a while,
   or perhaps for eternity.
Been there, done that, -

and hit that wall of unanswerable questions.
