Hurray! a bug report :)

I suspect you want to specify --append="root=/dev/xyz" when calling kexec.

Generally you want to put kexec -e your shutdown scripts just before
the call to reboot.  And then you can just say: kexec ...
and the you get a clean system shutdown.  Dropping to run level 1
before calling kexec tends to get most of the user space shutdown
called as well.  It is definitely a good idea to be certain X is
shutdown before calling kexec. 
With respect to USB it is quite possible something in the USB drivers
does not shutdown correctly on a reboot, and the driver then has trouble
reinitializing the device.
Since you got to the point of mounting root earlier when you did not
specify anything I wonder if you some of your command line arguments
made the situation worse.  
Which kernel are you booting with kexec anyway?
This is actually an expected failure mode, but one I have not seen
much of yet.  The new kernel not coming up because the old drivers
left the hardware in a state the new drivers cannot handle.
