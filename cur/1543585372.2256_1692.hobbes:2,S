<checking 2.2.0>
Nope, no calls into ext2/*. do_revalidate() seeing NULL ->i_revalidate
and doing nothing, lnamei() doing usual lookup, cp_old_stat() not touching
fs code at all...
The only change was s/lnamei()/user_path_walk_link()/ and they are
equivalent, modulo different API (filling nameidata vs. returning
dentry).
