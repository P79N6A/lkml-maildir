I am not doing this to reduce the size of the Config.in files.  I am doing it 
because my main project (writing a script to provide stripped-down versions 
of the Linux kernel source code for people over slower connections) all but 
requires everything neat and in it's own directory for optimal performance.  
I could use a lot of grep/gawk but that would cause more problems for people 
who wanted to download the stripped source code.
Besides, it's The Right Thing To Do {tm}
