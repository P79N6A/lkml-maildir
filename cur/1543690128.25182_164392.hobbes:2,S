As others noted, a Mandrake-specific list is a better choice in this
instance, but the problem you noted below happens occasionally in 2.4
bleeding edge stuff, so I'm posting something for you to look for.

Try something like this in your /usr/src/linux directory:
$ find . -name [Cc]onfig.in | xargs grep "'y'"
./drivers/char/Config.in:if [ "$CONFIG_IA64_GENERIC" = "y" -o "$CONFIG_IA64_SGI_SN2" = 'y' ] ; then
See the 'y' above?  That's a mistake in 2.4.23-pre3.  I don't have the
Mandrake 9.2rc1 kernel source, but you do, so find the bug and report it
to Mandrake. They most likely have this problem already fixed in cooker,
but at least you may be able to get your local system fixed.
There are other ways to cause make xconfig to fail as you described, but
this is one of the more common.
