no - that would introduce a small race: if an exception (say an NMI or 
MCE, or a debug trap) happens in that small window then the exception 
context thinks that it's on the IRQ stack already, and would use the task 
stack.
So if we want to move them to IRQ stacks all the time, we have to check 
that condition atomically - the safest way of which is to check RSP 
against the (static) pda:[irqstackptr-16K+64..irqstackptr] range.
