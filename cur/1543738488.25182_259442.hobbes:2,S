After reviewing the thread, this seems to be the most important reason
why this patch can't be included.  So I thought, "Hey, I'll fix that."
But put_user, get_user, etc. may sleep (of course).
They're also "user context only".
This is a hardware trap handler.  What sort of context is that?  Is
it really "user context"?  Worse, we're attempting to emulate an
*atomic* instruction (CMPXCHG).
So how do I guarantee:
(1) the original process doesn't get resumed during the sleep
(perhaps this is guaranteed by other things?)
(2) nobody else messes with the data we're messing with, so that this is
actually atomic.  (Note that we're assuming there's no SMP, because this
is an i386 and there are no known i386 SMP machines supported by Linux.
So the only problem is stuff woken during sleep.)  Basically, this means
no other process which might share the memory can be woken up during the
sleep either.  :-P
Is this possible, or hopelessly difficult?
