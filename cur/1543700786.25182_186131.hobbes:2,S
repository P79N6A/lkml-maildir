There seem to be some other unnecessary patches in there, like
init_fixmap_vma.diff.patch. I cannot imagine why a file system should
need to change that. Same with spinlock-owner.diff.patch. Is that
really needed? If yes porting it to all architectures will be a lot of
work.
I would suggest separating your debug patches, like page-owner.diff.patch
And your webserver is misconfigured: I thinks READ.ME is a troff
document.
The other changes look reasonable, although a lot of the EXPORT_SYMBOLs
should be probably EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL and carry some more comments about
their purpose.
