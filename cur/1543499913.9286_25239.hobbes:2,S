Please don't guess/exaggerate: I've already posted fsck benchmark
times to this mailing list a month ago. In particular, fsck for a
43 GB ext2 filesystem (4K blocks) with 30 GB in use took 13 minutes.
Disk usage was 25 directories each with a copy of the Linux 2.2.1
source tree (63MB, 4000 files) and each with 200 subdirectories
holding 5 files of 1MB.
That was with a single SCSI bus connected to a (software) RAID5 array
of 6 x 9GB (10K RPM) disks. Triple that to a three-way SCSI adapter
connected to one 43 GB array each and fscking the whole damn lot will
run in parallel and take about the same time: 13 minutes. Not 3 hours.
The person you replied to who said an additional 10 minutes for fsck
was far closer then your guess.
If you want to treat 100 GB of disk like tape with slow access then
fsck will take longer but any decently configured system with a lot of
disk should also have a decent I/O subsystem.
