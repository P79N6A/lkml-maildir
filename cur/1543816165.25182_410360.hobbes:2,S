Subject: [PATCH 001 of 3] md: Remove bi_end_io call out from under a spinlock.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

raid5 overloads bi_phys_segments to count the number of blocks that
the request was broken in to so that it knows when the bio is completely handled. 
Accessing this must  always be done under a spinlock.   In one case we
also call bi_end_io under that spinlock, which probably isn't ideal as
bi_end_io could be expensive (even though it isn't allowed to sleep).
So we reducde the range of the spinlock to just accessing bi_phys_segments.
