Hi,
I think that one good partial solution to security with modules anyway could
be:
    - extending the module (/binary?) format in 2.4/2.5 to include digital
signatures
    - digitally signing modules via an encrypted digest
    - done by known, trusted organisation (eg Linus)
    - possibly enforced for 2.4/2.5 - ultimately this is required
    - integrated into the kernel
then
    - modifying modutils
        - add digital signature checking
        - maybe refuse to load module unless overridden with some flag in eg
/etc/modules.conf
        - log all non-trusted loading of modules
This should work well, since the user will know whether the modules loading
are trusted or not.
I think this is a step in the right direction. Really, it shouldn't be hard
to implement, apart from encryption exporting
eg need to use 40-bit RSA encryption rather than 56-bit or 128-bit. IIRC
there may have been a change about US policy regarding encryption export
recently. 40-bit is a start anyway.
Maybe an interim bonus would be to add a module checksum or something to see
if it has been modified/hacked/infected, etc.
Any ideas?
