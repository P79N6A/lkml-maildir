Is this mthca code unique?
Would not it be better to teach lockdep about this scenario somehow?

This moves code out of a common function and so results in code duplication
and has memory cost.

And then we'll have to remember to update this comment when lock
is moved to another place?

Looks wrong, to me. Is it a good idea to fix correct code?
Assuming its important, can we maybe add some annotations to make lockdep shut
up, instead?
