This slows down boot process because probing for mice and keyboards
takes too long (for some touchpads it takes about 4 seconds to do
reset). We could change allocation from GFP_ATOMIC to GFP_KERNEL for
SERIO_REGISTER_DRIVER events to make it more robust but otherwise I'd
leave serio_register_driver return void. You could also add a flag to
serio driver indicating whether registration is complete and check
that flag in serio_unregister_driver so it does not do stupid things.
