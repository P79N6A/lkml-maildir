That comment isn't right.  del_timer_sync works perfectly well even if
the timer routine re-enables itself, provided it stops doing so after a
small number of iterations.

You don't have to worry about any of that stuff.  Just check the 
insuspend flag and don't re-enable the timer if it is set.  Even 
without any memory barriers, the timer routine won't iterate more than 
once or twice.
