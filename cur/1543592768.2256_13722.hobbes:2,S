Also, what compiler are you using?  Depending on your current compiler,
switching to another compiler according to one of the following
permutations would be very instructive for us debugging the problem, at
least.
	gcc-2.96-RH -> gcc-2.95.3
	gcc-2.95.2 -> gcc-2.95.3
	gcc-2.95.3 -> egcs-1.1.2
Regards,
	Jeff
