gfs went proprietary - you want opengfs
A lot of good work on the rest of that multi-node clustering is going on
already - take a look at the compaq open source site.
cccluster is more for numa boxes, but it needs the management and SSI views
that the compaq stuff offers simply because most programmers won't program
for a cccluster or manage one.
