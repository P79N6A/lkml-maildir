Someone take a look at pc_keyb.c and figure out how to disable the
compiling of this file into the kernel. USB support if found and enabled
precludes the need for pc_keyb.c as demonstrated by the kernel warning:
"keyboard: Timeout - AT keyboard not present?"
My system tested out with compiled 2.4.0 Test2 and 5 with this error,
even though my keyboard and mouse were detected and subsequently
properly loaded at kernel boot.
As found in pc_keyb.c :
---------------------------------------------------------------
unsigned long timeout = KBD_TIMEOUT;
  acknowledge = 0; /* Set by interrupt routine on receipt of ACK. */
  resend = 0;
  reply_expected = 1;
  kbd_write_output_w(data);
  for (;;) {
   if (acknowledge)
    return 1;
   if (resend)
    break;
   mdelay(1);
   if (!--timeout) {
#ifdef KBD_REPORT_TIMEOUTS
    printk(KERN_WARNING "keyboard: Timeout - AT keyboard not present?\n");
#endif
    return 0;
---------------------------------------------------------------
No point if it's detected at kernel boot with USB support.
