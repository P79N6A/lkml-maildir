Do we really still think USB deserves the Experimental label?
I use it all the time and it seems about as solid as any of
the other subsystems.  I know drivers continue to evolve, get
bugs fixed and new ones get added, but is that a good reason
to mark all USB support experimental?
Just wondering what the criteria are,
