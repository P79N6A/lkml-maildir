I'd say go for it. drivers/char/ is looking quite cluttered, and this
has the added advantage of decreasing the size of the Config.in and
config.help files too.
One thing though, please do the move first, and submit that, then do the
cleanups and submit seperatly. It makes things much easier to track
whats going on.
