Charles, would you mind trying the patch below against -git13 on your 
machine. I tested it with wine and firefox on a 32 bit P4 with HT and it's 
working fine.
Andrew, do not even look at it. Comments are totally broken, and for sure 
does not apply over the latest tree after you pushed the other epoll bits.
I'll repost a polished version once it has been verfied.
