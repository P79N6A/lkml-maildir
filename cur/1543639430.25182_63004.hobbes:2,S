Use e100 driver from Intel [1] with the following parameters:
insmod e100.o BundleSmallFr=1 IntDelay=0x600 ucode=1
Intel's driver supports all the interrupt saving features (interrupt
delay and small packet bundling) present in EEPro/100 cards. The driver
is now GPL, so it should get back to the mainstream kernel.
