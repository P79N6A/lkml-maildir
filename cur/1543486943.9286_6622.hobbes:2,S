Given what Linus says, perhaps the best solution is to do #2 for 2.2
in order to preserve module compatibility, and #1 for 2.3.
If we could do it in a way that the NFS filehandles remain the same
going from 2.2 to 2.3 for at least ext2, it would be ideal, I think.
Having all of your filehandles go south on you just because your Linux
NFS server was upgraded should happen as rarely as possible (never is
best, but I agree that we need to add the generation number, and I
don't know if we can add it without breaking filehandles once).
