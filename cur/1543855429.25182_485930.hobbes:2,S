My original reply to this seemed to disappear into my email system
somewhere, so apologies if this is the second copy you get.
The DLM shouldn't depend upon SYSFS at all. I believe that its perfectly
ok whether or not thats compiled in. There is a patch relating to the
Kconfig for DLM which is in my -nmw tree:
http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/steve/gfs2-2.6-nmw.git;a=commitdiff;h=8758fbc8724c2da8a6a062f2b61d79c8f2a55c5f
This applies after the patch adding the TCP communications layer to DLM
which is also in -nmw. The patches in -nmw (next merge window) are a
superset of the ones I just requested that Linus pull since it contains
the newer features and more involved bug fixes and clean ups.
I believe that the Kconfig in -nmw is correct for DLM, though I'm
willing to be proved wrong. I'm also copying in Patrick in case he wants
to comment further as its more his area than mine,
Steve.
