Really?
A Jack Russell is a dog because anything you say about a dog can
also be said about a Jack Russell.
A counting semaphore is a mutex for the same reason (and observe
that 99% of users use the semaphore as a mutex). A mutex definitely
is not a counting semaphore. David's implementation of mutexes
don't count at all.
If you want to use a semaphore as a mutex, DECLARE_SEM_MUTEX isn't
a terrible name.
