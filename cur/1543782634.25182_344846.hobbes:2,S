Subject: [patch 03/18] remap_file_pages protection support: make mprotect skip pagetables on nonuniform
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

There is IMHO no reason to support using mprotect on non-uniform VMAs. The
only exception is to change the VMA's default protection (which is used for
non-individually remapped pages), but it must still ignore the page tables, as
done in this patch.
The only unsatisfied need is if I want to change protections without changing
the indexes, which with remap_file_pages you must do one page at a time and
re-specifying the indexes.
It is more reasonable to allow remap_file_pages to change protections on a PTE
range without changing the offsets. I've not implemented this, but if wanted I
can. For sure, UML doesn't currently need this interface.
However, for now I've implemented only this change to mprotect(), I'd like to
get some feedback about this choice.
