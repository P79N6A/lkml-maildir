Hello again,
was my report so complicated? Perhaps I shouldn't have included so many 
oprofile outputs. Anyway, if anyone wants to have a look, the most important 
is two_discs_bad.txt oprofile output, attached on my original message. The 
problem is 100% reproducible for me so I would appreciate if anyone told me 
he has similar experiences. 
Thanks, 
Dimitris
