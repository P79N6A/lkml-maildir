I never seen it to vary 30% on the same kernel.
Anyways dbench tells you mostly about elevator etc... it's a good test
to check the elevator is working properly, the ++ must be mixed with the
dots etc... if the elevator is aggressive enough. Of course that means
the elevator is not perfectly fair but that's the whole point about
having an elevator. It is also an interesting test for page replacement,
but with page replacement it would be possible to write a broken
algorithm that produces good numbers, that's the thing I believe to be
bad about dbench (oh, like tiotest fake numbers too of course). Other
than this it just shows rmap12a has an elevator not aggressive enough
which is probably true, I doubt it has anything to do with the VM
changes in rmap (of course rmap design significant overhead is helping
to slow it down too though), more likely the bomb_segments logic from
Andrew that Rik has included, infact the broken page replacement that
lefts old stuff in cache if something might generate more unfairness
that should generate faster dbench numbers for rmap, but on this last
bit I'm not 100% sure (AFIK to get a fast dbench by cheating with the vm
you need to make sure to cache lots of the readahead as well (also the
one not used yet), but I'm not 100% sure on the effect of lefting old
pollution in cache rather than recycling it, I never attempted it).
