That's fairly weird.  Overloading ptraceability is awkward, but also the
*direction* is wrong.  It's saying "if I can ptrace you, you can read my
data".  I'd have expected to see "if you can ptrace me, you can access my
data".

hrm.  Makes some sense.

It's ugly ;)
But the problem you're addressing here largely revolves around the fact that
the filesystem implementation is a userspace process which is potentially
owned by a different user.  So you need to prevent the mount owner from
peeking at the fs user's activity.  That problem is unique to FUSE and so a
solution within fuse is appropriate.
This security feature doesn't sounds terribly important to me.  So the fuse
server can find out what files I'm looking at.  But I've already
deliberately given the fuse server the ability to ptrace my process?
Can we enhance private namespaces so they can squash setuid/setgid?  If so,
is that adequate?
