I understand that this is a concern of yours based on some experience you
had with earlier controllers.  In general, this behavior would be considered
incorrect - link power management should not translate to disk parking, even
on PATA->SATA brigdes, and if it does, then that's completely broken.  That 
said, I would believe you if you said broken hardware exists, and when you 
get specific examples of it, you can add it to the blacklist for this feature.
