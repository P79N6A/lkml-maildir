Subject: [PATCH] sched domain debug sysctl fixes
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The following 5 patches provide fixes for the sysctl code added under
CONFIG_DEBUG_SCHED.   After debugging a boot failure dereferencing
not per-cpu data for an impossible cpu, I found the other issues by
inspection.
Following these fixes, /proc/sysctl/kernel/sched_debug/ should work with
exclusive cpusets, cpu hotplug, offline and not present cpus, and will
show all 11 files.
