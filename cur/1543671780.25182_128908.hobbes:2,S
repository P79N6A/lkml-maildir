Well, gee.  It's so pretty it's hard to say no.  :)
I've wanted this capability, dynamically adding PCI ids to drivers, for
a while.  In addition to this feature, it also makes the existing code
a bit better.  And it certainly seems sysfs-friendly, though getting
an expert in that area to look over the sysfs parts would be nice, too.
