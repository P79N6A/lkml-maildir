[hash_conntrack(&ct->tuplehash[IP_CT_DIR_REPLY].tuple)].
i've wrestled quite a bit with this problem, but never really could
figure out the correct answers.  some people blamed the compiler, but
different versions of the compiler still produced it.
i saw it in 2.4.18 and 2.4.19pre kernels on my dual athlon.
in the end i found switching from snat to masqerading for my internal
network seemed to eliminate it.  also i found that if i eliminated my
udp outgoing remote log stream from syslog-ng, i could keep the snat
and have the box still live.
i'm now running nicely with 2.4.19, snat firewall rules, and no remote
logging.
