I got the clue to add the following to /etc/modules.conf, which solved
my problem.  I would like to echo the question of where this is
documented:
alias ppp-compress-21 bsd_comp
alias ppp-compress-24 ppp_deflate
alias ppp-compress-26 ppp_deflate
I do have a followup.  I'm also getting the following module message
which totally flummoxed me.  I knew there was an alias documented
somewhere I could use to turn on the magic.  I didn't even know there
WAS a module for /dev/ttyS0!
