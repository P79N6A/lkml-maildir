	Doesn't it make sense to decide on a feature set and method of
implementation _before_ you begin coding? Or does it make sense to just
start coding something that might never work or do what anybody wants?
	When you decide to implement something, do you usually code before you
decide exactly what it is you're trying to implement and whether anybody
wants it? I certainly don't.
	This isn't a very good example because this a rather bad idea overall. But
if you think it's stupid and will never work, just say that. Kill with legal
blows, especially when you're right.
