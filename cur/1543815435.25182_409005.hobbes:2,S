Fascinating, gave up on dprobes, not really! I thought the kernel community
felt it was the wrong implementation. We did remove all the RPN stuff to a
loadable kernel module and left behind a minimal API set - krpobes - which
comprised the kernel probing mechanism, user-space probes extensions and
watchpoint probes extension. The result was identical functionality to the
original dprobes but with a minimal patch to the mainline kernel. But in
addition it provided a very much more generalized interface that would
allow other utilities to exploit the kernel interface, which they have. In
this sense dprobes still exists and can be used on top of krpobes. What
would you recommend be retained from  dprobes? And what further
modifications?
