As some people pointed out (THANKS!):
Like half of the times (and fortunately, I'm not the only one that this
applies to), I forgot to really attach the patch. Grrr!
[It seems the problem is that you can't specify the attachment during
 writing but only after. Unfortunately, this can't be solved w/o MUA/editor
 inegration, which I also don't like]
