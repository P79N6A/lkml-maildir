It would call pskb_expand_head() otherwise, so we'd hit the same
warning.

I think the idea is build skb, hand off to netlink layer and never think
about it again.  Fire and forget, what's not to like? ;-))

This has some issues w.r.t. truesize and socket buffer space.  The trim
is done to keep accounting sane, so we'd either have to trim ourselves
or take into account the change in size.  And ultimately, we'd still get
trimmed by netlink, so the GFP issue is still there.  Ideally, gfp_any()
would really be _any_
