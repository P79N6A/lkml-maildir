If it was correctly designed, it would be possible to change the
hardware or even the kernel through a STD cycle.  And that would be
damn interesting on servers.
In any case, if I could trust it, I'd use it when I need to move
servers around and I don't want to lose what is running.  Riding power
cuts that way would be nice.
