I was not talking about checkpatch warnings.
I'm talking about checkpatch errors for code like
						if ((page_count!=0)&&(page_count<<12)-(region->offset&(4096-1))>=region->length)
I have to accept that Linus prefers to have the driver merged first and 
let janitors make the code readable in subsequent patches, but if GNU 
indent wasn't unable to properly cope with the fact that this driver has 
over 2000 lines that are over 80 characters long I'd simply run this 
driver through scripts/Lindent .
