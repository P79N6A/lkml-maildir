On my system it says:
[root@capsize /root]# x11amp
socket: Too many open files
Whooops... You caught a bug, please mail psy@x11amp.ml.org and describe what 
you were doing.
[root@capsize /root]#
I have tried it with 2.1.132, 2.1.132-ac2, and 2.1.133-pre1.  The problem
is most definatly caused by some patch between 2.1.131 and 2.1.132.
BTW, I tried running it as root and with and without suid but it refuses
to work on my system.
If anyone needs details about my system to help debug this, please let me
know what I can do...
Until its fixed I'll guess I'll have to stick with 2.1.131 (without those
nice speed improvements :(
