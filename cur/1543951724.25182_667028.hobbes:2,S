Yes, code is only one part of a balanced architecture.
It's pretty weak at conveying any "big picture" issues,
especially with only one underlying implementation.  If
I can't get that picture without reviewing 100+ KBytes
of code, then something critical is missing...
I've been pushing for clear explanations in part because,
well, nobody else has.  I've come across clear needs for
basic power switching, to manage sections of both SOCs and
boards; and less clear needs for voltage adjustment.  I've
been hoping some of the other folk who have looked at these
issues would chime in.
