Subject: [PATCH encrypted swsusp 0/3] encrypted swsusp image
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The following patches allow for encryption of the on-disk swsusp image
to prevent data gathering of e.g. in-kernel keys or mlocked data after
resume.
For this purpose the aes cipher must be compiled into the kernel as
module load is not possible at resume time.
A random key is generated at suspend time, stored in the suspend header
on disk and deleted from the header at resume time. If you don't resume
a mkswap on the suspend partition will also delete the temporary key.
Only the data pages are encrypted as only these may contain sensitive data.
This works on my x86_64 laptop (64bit mode) and probably needs testing
on other platforms.
