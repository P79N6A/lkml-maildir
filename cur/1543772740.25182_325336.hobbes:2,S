I agree. But, I thought that it is better than soft/hard dichotomy
of real-time, which makes even less sense in reality. Or, worse the
dichotomy of non real-time and real-time -- which is the point I was
trying to make. And, even though, in practice we talk about real-time
operating systems vs non real-time operating systems -- the difference
is not that fundamental as some would like to believe.
