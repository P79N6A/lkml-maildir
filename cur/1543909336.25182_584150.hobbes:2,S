David Airlie was listed as the owner on several of the files and in 
maintainers for "DRM", which was my best to: guess for 
/drivers/char/drm (which was patch 3 in this series).
If there was a better list, or just to linux-kernel, please let me 
know as tracking down the 'right' list for these kernel-janitor 
kind of tasks can be tricky....
