Or something else changed that he didn't realize.  Just the other day, I
applied a one-line patch that hit one .c file, and *the entire kernel*

Took me a while to figure out that I'd been looking for something else, and
done a 'vi Makefile' in the top level, and exited with 'ZZ' rather than ':q' ;)
