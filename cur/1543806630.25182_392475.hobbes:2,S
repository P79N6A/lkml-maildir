Oops, sorry about that.  Perhaps I should repeat that MCE for the sake
of discuss@, as decoded by mcelog:
MCE 0
CPU 0 4 northbridge TSC 91ec03f09330
ADDR 104500000
  Northbridge GART error
       bit61 = error uncorrected
  TLB error 'generic transaction, level generic'
STATUS a40000000005001b MCGSTATUS 0
>> The spurious MCE is TLB-related.  I *think* the bit for the correct

Someone tried to track these messages down together with someone else
from AMD, but they never got it finished.
For reference, here's the lspci -n output for the system.  It's a
two-way Opteron box (248, 2.2 GHz, stepping 10) with 8 GB of RAM.
(BIOS and chipset details are not available to me at the moment.)
The MCEs only appeared after a switch to a 64-bit kernel (2.6.15.2),
adding the second CPU, along with 4 GB of RAM.  Previously, the box
ran 2.6.13 in 32-bit mode, and no MCEs appeared regularly.
In the history of the system, there was one more MCE, but we thought
at that time it was related to thermal issues (it happened after
someone had switched off air conditioning in the server room *cough*).
