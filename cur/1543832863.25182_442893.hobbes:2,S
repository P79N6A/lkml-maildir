Please look at what the code changes.
Please recognize how very bad the current code is behaving.
As for the rest sure go ahead and create a patch to address it
but that really is a separate issue and thus a separate patch.
I'm just trying to keep the kernel from calling BUG_ON the first
time a msi irq is allocated on a kernel with a maximum NR_CPUS
configuration, and from wasting memory the rest of the time.
Or you know how bad the msi code is when every patch to fix a major
issue is followed up comments on how to improve the code even further.
