I don't know but I think it would be the better approach to find it. That
also separates notification of state to parents from the general problem
of wanting to know when a service has died, which seems to be an ever
more common point of interest on the desktop in particular.
File content change notification for /proc is hard because the contents
don't exist in the normal way and get updated but can be done if there is
a wait queue for the job. Actual changes to structure (new directories
etc) is in part a similar problem but there are clear points already in
existence when the proc nodes are created/destroyed and thus notification
can occur.
