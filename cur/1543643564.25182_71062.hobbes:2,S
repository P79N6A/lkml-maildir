Once again. BS. 99% of the cases where I had to work on foreign code,
it was a codebase where someone with a clue wrote something nice, and
then lots of people without clue "improved" that code. Then I start to
work on it and have to clean up the mess. First thing is that you want
to everytime is, to _understand_ what the original author wanted to do
with the code and what the clueless did to this idea. A debugger is a
decent toy for this. commons-logging another.
Code which was written like you describe is never hard to
understand. Clueful people know that they have to comment their
"tricks".
Ask me about Bean-Setters with a return value. Now that's clever. =:-(
