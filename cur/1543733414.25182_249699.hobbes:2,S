And drum roll please...
The dri cvs snapshot works fine on both it's own kernel module, and
the one that comes
with 2.6.8.1. So now what? (And does this mean it isn't a kernel bug?)
<rant>
Also, what happens to r200 users who happen to use Debian? Using dri
cvs snapshots
obviously isn't an option for everyone (though I don't mind at all)
and upgrading to Xorg
(when Xorg gets this fix if it doesn't already) is even less of an
option. The official word
from the Debian X Strike Force is not to switch to Xorg until debriX
(modular X) gets
somewhere.
