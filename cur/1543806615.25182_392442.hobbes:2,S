I cannot disagree with the obvious trend to date, but rather than argue the 
many reasons why ram prices are artificially high right now, instead just 
grab a stick of ram in your left hand, and the heavy lump of precision 
engineered metal that is a hard drive in your right, and see if you can 
convince yourself that the one on the right will still be ahead of the curve 
in another 14 years.
Maybe it will. Drop me a mail in 2020 and I'll shout you dinner if you're 
right ;)
