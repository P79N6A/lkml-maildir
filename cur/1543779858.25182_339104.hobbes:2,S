First step would be to look in /proc/partitions (and the system logfile)
to get an idea of what the kernel thinks is there.  When you call
add_disk(), the kernel should emit some messages noting the partitions
that it sees.  My guess is a mismatch of minor numbers between your
device nodes and what the kernel sees (it's hard for me to make complete
sense out of your minor number logic), but I could be wrong.
