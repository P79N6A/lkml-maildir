Either that, or start down the path to true evilness... work out how to 
interface a WinModem VXD from the kernel, using WINE code segments in the
kernel if required and some kind of abstraction layer.
(I don't know if VXDs can call DLLs - if they can, then you need to be really
sick and twisted to do this)
Advantage:
   might be successful some time in the next few centuries
   expandable to support other unsupported hardware in just a few decades
   VXD format is probably more documented than WinModems
Disadvantages:
   big, unstable, buggy kernel would result, running untrusted binary modules
   need to meet WinModem's scheduling constraints
   need to make ultra-mega-bzImage
   need to make emulate other VXDs which are used by VXD in question(?)
   idea has no signs of sanity
   nobody in their right mind would accept the patches
On the subject of undocumented proprietary hardware, Toshiba also use Lucent
DSPs in their notebooks.  Maybe Toshiba notebook owners could try and pressure
them for the specs of the DSPs - but then, nobody's managed to get any success
on the matter of Toshiba's FIR ports yet either :-(
