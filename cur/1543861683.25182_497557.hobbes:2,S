Yeah. I have to say, that with my main goal for 2.6.20 being a stability 
release, and the APIC setup scaring me too, I'm starting to strongly lean 
towards just reverting the thing, and then having this whole thing 
re-introduced early during the 2.6.21 cycle with the new information we 
have (ie the clues about exactly why the dang thing broke in the first 
place).
After all, the only reason I didn't want to revert the commit initially 
was that it did clean things up, and I wanted to understand why it didn't 
work. I think we understand why it caused problems, and I think we can fix 
them, but on the other hand, we're already deep into -rc4 with this, so 
let's just revert for now and then clean it up correctly after the 2.6.20 
release.
