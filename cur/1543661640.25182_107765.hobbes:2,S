I always see the logo twice. The first time it's erased by the text (because
initially fbcon thinks logo_height = 0), the second time it's displayed
correctly.
So I also wondered why it's drawn twice?

OK for me.

Why would it increase kernel size that much? The logos were there before as
well (unless you enable all of them, of course :-).
