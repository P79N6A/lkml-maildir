...and it sucks.  Same problem as with updatedb - 99% of all work is
bogus, but you don't know which 99%, because the one knowing about it,
the kernel, doesn't tell you a thing.
Maybe a simple notification mechanism would sufficiently solve this as
well, so all the rest can be done in userspace.  Basically a file with
a simple format like this:
#path	offset	len
/tmp/foo	0	12
Meaning that bytes 0-11 of /tmp/foo have changed in whatever way.
Something like that, the details don't matter too much.
