Mainline is suffering too - lots of people I know running 2.6 on production
systems have noted a marked increase in problems, crashes, odd things. 
I'd bet you get a lot of people who'd vote for a timeout right now to figure
out what's going wrong.
There is the distinct impression that we are going down hill in this series.
My personal feeling is that this trend started almost immediately after OLS.
I can try to gather the general reports I hear from people - it might well
be that we are not reporting the bugs properly. I'm sitting on a couple of
odd things myself that need to be written up.
Thanks.
