If W2k can tell if I enable HT or not, I assume it's really on.
Particularly if it then tells me I have more than two CPUs, my license
doesn't cover that, and it doesn't love me anymore.
Actually, 2.5.recent can get this right using APCI and will also work.
Guess the rumor is true, although I would say "many P4" rather than "all
P4" because I believe Intel disables one sibling at the bonding step
(based on information elsewhere) for some CPUs.
