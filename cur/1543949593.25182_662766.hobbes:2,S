Mandatory alignment are specified as a parameter to kmem_cache_create not 
as flags. Ycan specify the alignment as a parameter. i.e. L1_CACHE_BYTES 
or cache_line_size().
Maybe we should drop SLAB_HWCACHE_ALIGN because of the confusion is 
creates because it seems that flags can be used to enforce alignments?
