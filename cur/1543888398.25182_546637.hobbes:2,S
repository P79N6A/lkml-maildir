And the fix is to use select.
Compare the handling of options like IRQ_CPU in arch/mips/Kconfig in 
current kernels with the handling in kernel 2.6.0 .
Or as an exercise, change drivers/net/Kconfig to no longer use
"select MII". When you are finished, ensure that you are handling it 
properly although the option is user visible...
There are cases where "default .. if .." is the right idiom, but there 
are also cases where "select" is the right idiom. And for helper code 
like ATARI_KBD_CORE, "select" is the right idiom.
