Found the references.  This seems to imply that EDD overwrites the area 
used by LILO 22.6.1.  LILO 22.6.1 uses the new boot protocol, with the 
full pointer, and seems to obey the spec as far as I can read the code. 
  I'm going to try to run it in simulation and observe the failure that way.
However, something is still seriously out of joint.  The EDD data 
actually overlays the setup code, not the bootsect code, and thus there 
"shouldn't" be any way that this could interfere.  My best guess at this 
time is that either the EDD code or LILO uses memory it's not supposed 
to use, and the simulation should hopefully reveal that.
Sorry if I seem snarky on this, but if we can't get to the bottom of 
this we can't ever fix it.
