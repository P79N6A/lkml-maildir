On a three of my machines, I have the same problem. I have found that
making the following changes to drivers/net/eepro100.c appears to fix the
problem (at least, it silences the messages, and all appears to work
fine). It may be important to note that I compile the eepro100 driver into
the kernel, rather than as a module.
In drivers/net/eepro100.c:
line 36, change "static int txfifo = 8" to "static int txfifo = 15"
line 37, change "static int rxfifo = 8" to "static int rxfifo = 15"
line 60, change "#define TX_RING_SIZE	32"
   to "#define TX_RING_SIZE	64"
line 61, change "#define RX_RING_SIZE        32"   
   to "#define RX_RING_SIZE     64"
This has silenced the errors on my machines (one Athlon on an Asus K7M
with two eepro100 cards, one Athlon on an Abit KA7 with one eepro100, and
one K6-2 on a DFI P5-BV3+ with one eepro100); I have seen no adverse
reactions to these changes.
