Sorry to follow up myself.
I want to add, that it also occurs without having update started.
The processes hang in D state in down_failed. They are not killable.
I got a hard hang. SysRq works, though. The disk I bonnied had a lot of
wrongly allocated blocks, in spite of Syncing and Umounting.
I did not see anything like that with plain 2.2.8
