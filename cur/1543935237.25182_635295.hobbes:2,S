Thanks for the answer.
I'm using whatever is the default mount option (which I think is
data=ordered). The only other mount option I use is nodiratime,noatime.
Note that a large part of the processes in D state are "waiting" in
__mutex_lock from generic_file_aio_write.
Another large part is coming from balance_dirty_pages_ratelimited_nr.
It seems that there was some writeback congestion to the block device.
All the /proc/sys/vm/* files are at their defaults.
This looks like if it wasn't possible to write to the block device anymore.
Could a block device write error (ie hardware failure) be the root cause?
Any other idea?
What should I try the next time it freezes?
