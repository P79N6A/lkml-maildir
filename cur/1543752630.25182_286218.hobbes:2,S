True.  
But there may be other, better solutions to the deadlock problem.
Several years ago, Roger Larsson wrote a completely user-space
realtime monitor program that works perfectly well for revoking
realtime privileges when it detects CPU starvation.  I still use it
occasionally to help debug problems if the built-in JACK watchdog
timer doesn't catch them.
In my view, Con Kolivas' SCHED_ISO prototype is a good avenue to
explore for mainstream kernel support.  With that approach, it is
relatively easy to build in protection against programs that abuse
their promised cycle reservations.  This appears to be similar to what
Apple is doing.
SCHED_OTHER is so timesharing oriented, that I seriously doubt its
appropriateness for soft realtime.  I say this naively without any
first-hand study of the current Linux implementation.  I do understand
traditional Unix schedulers (at one time in detail).  The general idea
was to punish CPU-bound processes and reward I/O-bound processes.

We already do.  That's why I was able to experiment with nice --20 so
quickly.  In fact, SCHED_OTHER is the default.  Users have to specify
-R (--realtime) before JACK requests SCHED_FIFO privileges.

Sure.
I didn't write that test script, BTW.  (I'd like to know who did.)
IIUC, it is one Lee Revell and Rui Nuno Capela have been using to test
Ingo's RP patches.  I got it from Rui.  I chose it because it was
handy and I figured Ingo would be familiar with its output.
We are considering including it (or some variant) in the JACK sources,
so any interested user can download JACK, configure, compile, and then
run `make test'.
It is a fairly heavy test.  The system takes an interrupt from the
audio card every 1.45 msec, then must schedule 22 realtime threads
belonging to 21 different processes (the JACK server and twenty
clients) before the next interrupt arrives.  An XRUN means the system
was late servicing the interrupt (very bad).  The "DSP load" indicates
that these threads are using a little over 1/3 of the total bandwidth
of my 1.5GHz Athlon XP.

Several people continue working with him on that.  Lee and Rui have
been instrumental in testing with Ingo's kernels and in developing
JACK patches to gather needed information.  Much of their
instrumentation will be included in the next JACK release.
We are all highly motivated to help.  We want Linux to have the best
soft realtime possible, while working within the very real constraints
of what it is practical to do in a general-purpose OS.  
I hate for the OSX folks to do better.
