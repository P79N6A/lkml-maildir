This is an _excellent_ patch and you should proffer it to Linus and Alan
when you are done.  I would recommend diffing off 2.4.14 instead of
2.4.13, to this end.
I haven't gone over the actual loglevel warnings, but I plan to.  A
quick glimpse shows you are changing what needs to be changed.  Good
job.
