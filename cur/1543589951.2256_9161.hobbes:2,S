Subject: pdc20267 both channels share one IRQ

Is it ok for an Promise Ultra 100 to have both channels
assigned the same IRQ?
I have one DTLA-307030 attached as master to each channel
and get transfer rates at around 12 - 16 MB/s.
As I have heard people reporting transfer rates of about 24 - 28 MB/s
I was wondering if there were some connections.
Is it me just being dumb and ignoring obvious facts or something 
misconfigured weirdly with my system?
