I'll make a SD-based version and send it to Con.

Ok, thanks.
btw, just out of curiosity. The very first approach I was thinking of
- was to move a task from the "expired" to the "active" array when its
priority is boosted (like rt_mutex_setprio() does for rt tasks).
Reasoning: getting a higher static_prio means getting an additional
quota of timeslice which still could be used during this rotation.
delta = task_timeslice(p->static_prio) - task_timeslice(old_static_prio)
Aha.. /here I'm looking at the mainline now/ another funny thing is
that a time_slice is not immediately affected by the change of
static_prio in set_user_nice(). If a task is in the expired array, it
will run the next rotation with the *old* time_slice (i.e. calculated
in task_running_tick() before putting the task in the expired array
and based on the *old* static_prio).
In theory, set_user_nice() could adjust a p->time_slice with "delta"
being calculated as shown above.. But ok, it's not more than a minor
inconsistency (of course, if I'm not missing something).

I apologize for this. Will fix.
