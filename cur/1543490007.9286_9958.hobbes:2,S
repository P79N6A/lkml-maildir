The thing to realize is that you're shutting down a 5M transistor
chip. When it's going full blast, expect say 1M of the transistors to
be "working". Running just a 64bit counter is keeping just a few
hundred transistors. Consider 10 bit-sections of the counter
"active". The rest accounts for less than a thousandth. Say 14
transistors per counter-section, so 140 transistors are active. So the
counter is just using about 1 6000th of the power of the whole
chip. So, indeed there is about a milliamp to win by turning it off,
but that is neglegible to what the rest of the system is using.
(At the electrical outlet, I measured a system: 55W when active, 40W
when CPU idle. So the CPU (Celeron-300) draws close to 12W (+/- 80%
efficiency in the powersupply), So shutting down the TSC would've cut
down another 2mw from the 40 that keeps the rest of the computer
spinning)
