i don't think it is dns related problems because the
other computers on the network can still use the same
dns server and rebooting fixes the problem. one other
thing i should add is that if i have already connect
to something like aim i can continue using it or
anything else that i already have established a
connection to. i have tried what someone else
suggested and let tcpdump run for a few minutes and it
seems to clear up the problem.
