Just curious -- how do you want to fix it for real? 
As far as I can see a delalloc counter needs to be exact to avoid OOM
deadlocks, but making it per CPU would require doing the accounting inexact.
The only way I can imagine is to use the 'cookie jar' trick by grabbing
some amount per CPU and only going back to the global counter when the 
local jar is used up, but that seems to have some drawbacks too, like 
keeping a lot of pages free with higher CPU counts.
