Wrong perspective.  The problem is that they may _appear_ to work as
described, but not actually work in the intended way.  That's a bug,
and it's a _hard_ bug to locate.

Cloud cuckoo land.  In the embedded world, there are folk still want
to have the security aspects as well.  Moreover, there are far more
folk who do _NOT_ want to have things like "disable the scheduler" -
think the realtime folk.

That's actually more of a reason to take away the toys they shouldn't
be playing with in the first place - the only reason these (wrong)
interfaces are being used is because they're easily accessible.  Had
they _never_ been visible to userspace, no one would've attempted to
use them in the first place.
So, take away the "easily accessible" bit on the common architectures
and they'll find different ways to meet their needs.  Hopefully, that
will be some portable solution instead of one where racy code goes by
unnoticed.  If it isn't, at least there will be build errors to tell
you something needs to be fixed (probably from the assembler!)
