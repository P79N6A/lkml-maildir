Hai ,
            Can you suggest me some url which discuss all these things .
Actually  i didn't get the point . You say kernel is not preemptive but it
can yield to other process when it is waiting for some resources . Well
then why it is not made preemptive .  Is SMP used to multiprocessor machine
. Do it have anything to do with preemtion .
regards
aneesh
