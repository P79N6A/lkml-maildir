I just experienced corruption with 2.3.41-pre2.  Config:  ASUS Dual-PII,
single IDE drive (UDMA/33), no SCSI.
Was doing a vendor "build everything" kernel build, which failed.  :) 
So after correcting the error and restarting, I/O errors on regular
files started appearing, mainly during really big 'rm' runs.
Haven't seen any corruption yet on my K6-2 (UP) box, but it doesn't see
really heavy disk usage like the SMP box.
Regards,
	Jeff
