Subject: [patch] __flush_one_page() on i386

On i386 we are doing a flush_tlb_current_task() when a __flush_one_page()
is requested. This is plain wrong as if there isn't the `invlpg` asm
instruction we should revert to the only bit more larger (and CPU local)
operation by moving back and forth the %%cr3 register so doing a full
flush of the local tlb and nothing more.
This bug is on both 2.2.x and 2.3.x.
In 2.3.18 __flush_one_page() actually is called by flush_tlb_page() in
smp.c and flush_tlb_page is called by kswapd. kswapd has no current->mm so
then flush_tlb_current_page() oopses because current->mm is null and it's
trying to dereference it to flush the mm of the current (kswapd) task.
Fix against 2.3.18ac4:
