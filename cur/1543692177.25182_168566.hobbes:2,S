Before replying, I should let you know that I have made an Arch
repository containing every version of Linux since 0.01 clear through
2.6.0-test5 available at 
http://arch.debian.org/.
  Please see the docs
there for more info.  While I have learned a lot about Arch since then
(particularly relating to proper naming of categories), you should
still be able to use it to experiment with the strengths and
weaknesses of arch, particularly relating to branching and marging.

That is completely wrong wrt arch; in fact, I would say it is the most
intrinsically distributed of any VC system I've seen.  Please see:
