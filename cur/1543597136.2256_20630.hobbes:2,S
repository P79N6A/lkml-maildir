How often would a company that demands 24x7 uptime /want/ to upgrade their 
kernel?  It seems to me that when the choice been decided to take that 
kind of a step in a production environment, that someone has done lots of 
tests with the new target kernel, so that even if they don't have the 
extra hardware to bring up another server in parallel, the most downtime 
that would be suffered would be the time it takes to do two boots (boot 
the new kernel, find out it doesn't work, reboot the old one.)
Not to discourage anyone, but is this really necessary, or is it something 
to be worked on just to say that it can be done?
Just a random comment from someone who knows very little.
Regards,
Mike
