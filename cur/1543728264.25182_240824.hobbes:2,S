The interactive bonus may interfere with fairness (the throughput bonus 
should actually help it for tasks with equal nice) so you could try 
setting max_ia_bonus to zero (and possibly increasing max_tpt_bonus). 
With "eb" mode this should still give good interactive response but 
expect interactive response to suffer a little in "pb" mode however 
renicing the X server to a negative value should help.

PS There's a primitive GUI available for setting the scheduler 
parameters at 
<
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/cpuse/gcpuctl_hydra-1.3.tar.gz?download>
this is just a Python script with a Glade XML file (gcpuctl_hydra.glade) 
which needs to be in the same directory that you run the script from.
