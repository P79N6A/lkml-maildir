Does anyone have performace figure for sx8 driver which is for promise SATAII150
8 port PCI-X adapter?
Someone reports that on a platform with sx8 driver, multiple hdparms on
different disks those are connected to the same adapter (there are 8 ports) can
not get more than 45MB/sec in total, whereas a SCSI based driver for the same
adapter gets around 150MB/sec.
Any comment on this?
