There's nothing in 2.4 which increments these, nor was there in 2.6.  Which
tends to imply that they weren't very important.
We could sort-of do this - move them into mm_struct (doing it in
task_struct was always wrong) and increment them in the VM.  But we'd need
some reason why these statistics are interesting, and we'd need an
explanation of what nswap and cnswap are actually supposed to represent.
