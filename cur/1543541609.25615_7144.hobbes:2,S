While I'm not neccissarily an "NTFS person," I feel 
compelled to point out that NTFS named streams operate 
as normal files, and are accessed via a namespace 
extension, the ":" character. BeFS, HPFS, etc. Extended 
Attributes can be built on top of NTFS-style Named 
Streams by providing accessor functions that simply 
opening a stream, writing a chunk of data to it, and 
closing it again. NTFS is the only FS, AFAIK, that 
supports such a generic view of streams. BeFS, the Mac,
etc. all use Extended Attributes available as name-value 
pairs only via special functions.
I am also not interested in a filesystem-specific hack.  
It just seems that the NTFS method of making streams 
usable by open(), read(), write(), seek(), etc. makes 
sense as a foundation for all types of EAs. You could 
even mmap() streams for the benefit of the accessor 
functions.
