The WDT in the 7101 is almost USELESS from user-space.  It has a MAXIMUM 1
second timeout, and is tied straight to RESET.  If you miss ONE feeding,
you reboot.  In our kernel we have a 1/4 second timer to feed the watchdog,
and we still have to hack into some stuff to ensure that it gets met.
There are places where (drivers mostly) think it is OK to spin for multiple
seconds with interrupts off.  If you put the responsibility for feeding the
WDT into user-space, I'll bet dollars to dimes you'll start experiencing
random reboots.  If I was allowed to, I would have used the WDT for reboot
ONLY, and had it off otherwise - it is WAAAAY finicky.
