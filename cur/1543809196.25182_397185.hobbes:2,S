No, he's suggesting that precedent should apply across unixen.  It makes
sense to Joerg, who programs for the lot of them like they share object
inheritance.  This is sometimes more problematic than others (vis a vis
cdrecord).  Joerg is disinclined to support the kind of compulsive
re-engineering that Linus encourages, even though you might do it because
it would make more sense re-engineered a certain way.  If I've understood
correctly (and charitably), he prefers compatibility over novelty.
I myself like functional novelty over conformant compatibility in the
adiaphora.
