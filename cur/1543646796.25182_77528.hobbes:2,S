s/every/& generic/.  Other than that, seconded.  BTW, one of the pending
changes is taking the last more or less generic ioctl (HDIO_GETGEO) into
a separate method...
->ioctl() is for driver-specific crud; stuff that won't be used by
any generic application.  "Make a cuckoo jump out of drive and sing
'1000 bottles of beer'" is a valid ioctl.  "Get drive size" isn't.
