"Contributing a cleanup" is what the Kernel Janitor Project
already offers.
But "Contributing an actual feature" is much harder:
You need a feature:
- with a realistic chance of being included and
- hard enough that the person suggesting it doesn't simply implement it
  himself instead of requesting it and
- easy enough that a newbie can implement it.
And the code should then be in a reasonable shape for being merged.
IMHO that's nearly impossible.
Realistically, offering a TODO item for a feature would require the one 
proposing it to do an amount of mentoring work that is not smaller than 
the amount of work he had to spend if implementing it himself.
This might be worth it if you know for sure the person you are mentoring 
stays active after completion of the feature - but this assumption is 
too often not true.
