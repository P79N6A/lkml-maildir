It might have come about because struct zone's lru_lock really does need
the irq disabled (because of things that happen at I/O completion time).
But I don't think struct mem_cgroup_per_zone's lru_lock needs it.

Ah, yes, I completely missed that, thank you.

Perhaps... my grasp on this is much too weak to be sure:
I'm pretty sceptical about changing control_type altogether.
Let me reply to Balbir, who still sees no issue there.
