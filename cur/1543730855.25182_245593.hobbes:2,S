  How  so?  The whole idea is that the underlaying OS that handles the
  copying  should  also  know  to  copy  everything, otherwise you can
  implement  everything  into  applications  and  just  skip the whole
  filesystem part.
  Of  course,  it  won't  work if applications themselves are actually
  transferring  the  data  and  create the new files directly onto the
  filesystem. This just seem so wrong.
