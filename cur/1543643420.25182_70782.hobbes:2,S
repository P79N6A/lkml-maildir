Perhaps it would be better to report the times in ticks using 
jiffies_to_clock_t(), and let the userland do further conversions?
The macro above has an overflow problem, it creates a counter
that wraps at 2^32 / HZ (instead of 2^32), and theoretically, the
userland doesn't even know what the internal HZ is.  The overflow
can be avoided with something like
#define MSEC(x) (((x) / HZ) * 1000 + ((x) % HZ) * 1000 / HZ)
but I think it would be cleaner just to change the units to ticks,
especially if we're moving it to a different file and procps will
need to be changed anyway.
