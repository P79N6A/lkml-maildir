It means two things:
(a) There is a bug in drivers/ide/pci/pdc202xx_new.c:init_hwif_pdc202new(),
    hwif->autodma shouldn't be set to 0 or "idex=dma" parameter won't work.
(b) If you don't use autodma you have to tune desired mode _explicitly_ first,
    because most of ->ide_dma_check() implementations (for pdc202xx_new.c
    it is pdcnew_config_drive_xfer_rate()) check for hwif->autodma.
