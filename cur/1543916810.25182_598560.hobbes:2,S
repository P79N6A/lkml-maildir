Hi,
This patch from Andi:
x86_64-mm-cpa-einval.patch
makes the hda_intel audio driver stop working on my HP nx6325.
The following line appears in dmesg (from 2.6.23-rc7-mm1:
ALSA /home/rafael/src/mm/linux-2.6.23-rc7-mm1/sound/pci/hda/hda_intel.c:1755: hd
a-intel: ioremap error
and the driver doesn't work afterwards.
Still, I'm not sure if the patch above is wrong or rather it exposes a problem
in the driver.
Greetings,
Rafael
