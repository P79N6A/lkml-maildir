Using aic7xxx and kernel v2.2.13.  Was running 2.2.5 for many months
w/o problem before moving to 2.2.13 about a week ago (i.e. I don't think
this is a controller/disk/cable/memory problem).  Today I got this
error in /var/log/messages:
Nov  3 15:10:58 yoda kernel: attempt to access beyond end of device
Nov  3 15:10:58 yoda kernel: 08:02: rw=0, want=1952540007, limit=8859847

Note there's no oops....
I've seen this before in 2.2.10 and a reboot would solve the problem.
I haven't rebooted this machine yet, I'm willing to leave this machine up
for a little while to help anybody debug.  However, please respond to me
directly saying whether or not you actually want me to do anything -- I
need to get this machine into a steady state sometime soon.
