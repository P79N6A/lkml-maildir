yeah. And by moving them next to each other, people actually have the 
real incentive to look and ponder: "these two files do similar things 
but they look so different. Does it _have_ to be so?". Often the answer 
is: no, it could really be shared.
And even when things will continue to be different, it's nice to have 
them side by side for documentation purposes as well. "we do this 
differently on 64-bit, because ...".
Key to starting all these cleanups is to create plain and simple 
physical proximity - and our transition arch/x86 and include/asm-x86 
achieves that - nothing more, nothing less.
