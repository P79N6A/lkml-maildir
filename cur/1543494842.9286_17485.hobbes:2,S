We have quite a few solaris boxes in school, and they are not too
stable. Our ss1000 server was so bad that we changed to _experimental
version of sparc64linux_, and yes it improved a bit. So if you'd trust
solaris for your bank account, you could as well go linux.

PS: every now and then, I go around solaris boxes and L1-A b them
because their console crashes. (To be fair I have to say that I L1-A b
2.1.74 boxes even more often than those solaris')
