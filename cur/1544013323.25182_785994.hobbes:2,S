Hi Andi, thanks for looking at things.

Grin, lots of the code needs to be cleaned, but locking.c is really just
a few wrappers around the mutex calls.  I don't think I had it at the
top of my to-be-cleaned list ;)

Sure, I'm happy to use a generic framework there (or help create one).
They are definitely a win for btrfs, and show up in most benchmarks.

Projects that are out of mainline have a difficult task of making sure
development can continue until they are in mainline and being clean
enough to merge.  I'd rather get rid of the small amount of compat code
that I have left after btrfs is in (compat.h is 32 lines).  
It isn't hurting anything, and taking it out makes it much more
difficult for our current users.

Yes, I tried to mark those as I did them (a very small number of
functions).  In general they were copied to avoid adding exports, and
that is easily fixed.

Christoph added a CAP_SYS_ADMIN check to the trans start ioctl, but I do
need to add one to the device add/remove/balance code as well.
The subvol/snapshot creation is meant to be user callable (controlled by
something similar to quotas later on).

Yes, there's quite some work to do in the error handling paths.

I don't disagree, please do keep in mind that I'm not suggesting anyone
use this in production yet.
