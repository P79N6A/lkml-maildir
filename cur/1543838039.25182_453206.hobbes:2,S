Thanks. I will try to look into this within a few days - it looks
strange. But you pstree is a great way to see when it happens.
I have been tossing around with an idea to do some of the veru initial
steps in a shell script rather than in make. This should allow us to
bring down the make invocations but this bug needs to be understood
first.
