I got this today:
	ls -U <big directory> 
	ls: Memory exhausted
Since this occured while nothing else was active, it's probably a MM bug
and I will chase it further.  However, it also shows that ls is well and
truly borked.  If anybody is going to work on it I'd suggest not only
improving the in-memory sort but adding a custom file-based sort or exec
sort as a fallback.
