Hi all.
This weekend i've installed 2.2.0-final, and i stay with just one little
trouble. In 2.2.0-pre5 my printer was recognited as it is:
darkstar:/# insmod parport
darkstar:/# insmod parport_pc
darkstar:/# insmod parport_probe
darkstar:/# _
And in the /proc/parport/0/autoprobe:
HP DESKJET 660C (some other thing i don't remember exactly, but is about my
printer ...)
But now, it says: Unknown printer (no IEE-18... compatible found) or
something like that.
Is there any thing i've forgot (except the exact messages)?
Thanks in advance, more info on request.
