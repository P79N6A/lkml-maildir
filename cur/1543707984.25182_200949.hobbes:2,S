I actually would prefer that cipher algorithm and cipher mode are seperated.
It's just a matter of personal taste that I'd like to stick things where I
think they belong. So imho it would be nicer to split this string into two
seperate: one for the cipher algorithm, the other for the mode of operation,
namely, "ecb" or "cbc-<ivmode>".

No obvious flaws for me. I've already argued in private different IV mode,
but one more time for the public ;) : I embraced the principal of reusing
components in security systems instead of depending on a large number on
different subsystems. The only IV mode which can finally make sence for me
is the use of cipher algorithm as hash algorithm. This will keep the risk of
breakage of the system by the insecurity of one component to a minimum. A
pratical reason for using one algorithm is that just one algorithm has to be
optimized (f.e. assembler optimized or hardware offloading). I'd like to
submit a patch for this as soon as dm-crypt is merged. Andrew: any ideas if
this will happen soon?

"""exploit""".
