I'd love to help others with the same problem that I have.  I know
basically nothing of e2fsck though, and I don't have time to research
and write a whole tutorial.  Maybe there's a wiki somewhere where I
can start something out with a structure and some information
regarding the stuff I've seen?

What kind of economic scale where you thinking about?

OTOH, the open source community rigorously PR Linux as an alternative
to Windows.
While the above attitude is fine by me, you're going to have to expect
to see some sad faces from Windows users when they create a filesystem
on a loop device and don't realize that the loop driver destroys
journaling expectancies and results in all their photos and home
videos going down the drain, all because nobody implemented a simple
"warning!" message in the software.
(Or whatever.  Lots of similar examples exist to show you that the "no
warranty: you use our software, you learn to hack it to do what you
want yourself or it's your own fault" argument is fallacious.)
