I tested 2.6.24-rc5 on my T60 (Intel e1000 built with NAPI) and installed
vsftp/apache with sendfile and enabled all offload options incl. TSO.
Repeated downloads of >500 MB with ftp or wget over the NIC onto ram- or
physical disk gives no corruption whatsoever. Speed of download to ramdisk
is a nice continuous 125 MB/sec.
Looks like the r8169 or the driver after all..
