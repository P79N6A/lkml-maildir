Well, I know why you get these errors with mm2. mm2 ibmvscsi
allows transferring longer scatterlists between the initiator
and the target than before. However that breaks compatibility
with the older target that was shipped with SLES 9.  Longer
scatterlists ARE supported with the target I recently posted
as an RFC.
I'm thinking we'll have to add a module paramter to limit
scatterlist sizes that defaults to the old behaviour.  Let
me sleep on that and kick it around with Linda tomorrow and
we'll figure out some kind of solution.
As Anton already reported, mm3 has an additional set of
breakages...
