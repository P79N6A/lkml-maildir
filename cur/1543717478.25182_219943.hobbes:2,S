The first reason to use a shift of 12 bits is:
you can see easily what the address of the owner's task structure is.
In addition, with page size of 16 Kbytes, you've got only 16 Tbytes
in the identity mapped kernel address space any way.
Should we move to a page size of 64 Kbytes, you can use a shift of
16 bits and you keep the address human readable ;-)
