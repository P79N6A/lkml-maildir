Like Pavel said, this won't work.

For PCI devices at least, DMA _can_ be disabled in a uniform way as 
devices are discovered.  Some platforms might not want to do this for fear 
it would kill the initial console display.
IRQs _cannot_ be disabled in a uniform way.  So they remain a problem.

But at some point you have to enable local IRQs, and then you're in
trouble if a device without a driver is generating requests.  Unless the 
new kernel can run with interrupts entirely disabled?  Seems pretty 
unlikely.
The real problem is that, in general, hardware _can't_ be reset properly
by a new kernel.  There are things that can help, like the PCI USB quirks
code.  That might be enough to handle the most pressing existing problems;  
certainly it would avoid the USB issues we've seen.  (But it needs to be
updated to avoid interfering with normal operations during
resume-from-disk.)
