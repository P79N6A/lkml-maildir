	I believe that assembly AES processes about 50MB/second on a
1GHz machine, but Tom is talking about the difference between 125kB/sec.
and 50kB/sec.  The C versus assembly issue is not on the scale that
Tom is asking about.
	Tom, although I'm not sure that I'll immediately have the time
to dig into your problem, I think it would increase the likelihood of
someone tracking it down if you could answer the following questions.
	In which direction did you take these benchmarks, inbound to the
Linux box, outbound from the Linux box, or both?  If both, is
there a difference between inbound and outbound performance?  What
private key algorithm are you configuring (aes, des, serpent)?  How
is your DSL connected (via ethernet, via USB, such as with SpeedStream)?
What kind of CPU are you using (probably doesn't matter, even if you're
using a 16MHz 386, but it would help in reproducing your problem to
know what the benchmarks should look like on a different system).
