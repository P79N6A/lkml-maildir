That was what I was afraid of. :-)
The only other kernel that I have tried was 2.4.7, from a Slackware 8.0
bootdisk, found at 
http://www.alphacent.com/opensource,
 which I needed to use
to be able to install the system. I then used this kernel as a temporary
measure for booting, no problems with it either, but I guess a lot has
changed since then...
Is there anything I can do to help? I can provide the kernel config if that
would be useful, (I can't get at it until tomorrow morning), which is the same
one I used on all three kernel builds. The box isn't in production use,
(funny, that), so I can run some tests if needs be.
Cheers
Matt
