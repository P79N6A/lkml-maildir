 If that is the case then EV6 is seriously flawed.  You normally have
non-cached locations buffered (since you don't always need peripheral
device accesses to be posted immediately) and can force a writeback with a
memory barrier.  I don't have my 21264 handbook handy, so I can't check
EV6 details at the moment, especially why it is different.
