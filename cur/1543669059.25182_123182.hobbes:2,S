Well it could still be an NFS problem.  Turning off htree on the server could
cause filenames to be returned in a different order (or is that illegal?) or
changed timing or such.
If Robert is seeing it on non-htree servers then we'd need to see that fixed
up before deciding if there is also an(other) htree bug.
First thing we need to do is to debug it.  Trond would have a better idea of
how to set about that than I.  Possibly a tcpdump of the traffic?
