Okay, I'll bite.
So what's root_dev_names in init/do_mounts.c?  If a default naming policy is 
so unacceptably evil, is that being removed in 2.5 and everybody being told 
to use major/minor for the root device?
By the way, why doesn't imposing consistent predefined major/minor numbers 
(0x0301 instead of "hda1") count as "policy"?   I'm honestly curious...
