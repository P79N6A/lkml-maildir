Shailabh,
Some of us find that it is easier and more reliable to use a special
purpose script to send patches, rather than trying to do so via our
email client.  Even though my email client, Sylpheed, probably sends
patches just fine, I enjoy the convenience of preparing the patches
and mailing instructions in my editor, before sending them off with
such a utility.
One possible such utility is 'sendpatchset', which I maintain:
  
http://www.speakeasy.org/~pj99/sgi/sendpatchset
It's a script, with the documentation embedded as the help message.
Especially when sending off multiple patches as a set, it provides
more reliable results than trying to prepare and send multiple such
simultaneous messages from the typical email client.
