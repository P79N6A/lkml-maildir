ACK!  sorry.  it's not the kernel code, it's raidstop.  it seems to open
/dev/md0 an extra time for what reason i'm not sure.  it even does it when
you're referring to other md devices.  for example:
# strace raidstop /dev/md3
...
open("/dev/md0", O_RDONLY)              = 4
ioctl(4, 0x800c0910, 0x804fd1c)         = 0
open("/dev/md3", O_RDWR)                = 5
fstat64(5, {st_mode=S_IFBLK|0660, st_rdev=makedev(9, 3), ...}) = 0
ioctl(5, 0x932, 0)                      = 0
...
mdctl doesn't have this problem.
fwiw dpkg tells me i've got raidtools 0.90.20010914-9
