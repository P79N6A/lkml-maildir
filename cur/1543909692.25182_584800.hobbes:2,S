Irrespective of whatever the standard says, EVERY platform and  
compiler anybody makes nowadays has a NULL pointer value with all  
bits clear.  Theoretically the standard allows otherwise, but such a  
decision would break so much code.  Linux especially, we rely on the  
uninitialized data to have all bits clear and we depend on that  
producing NULL pointers; if a NULL pointer was not bitwise exactly 0  
then the test "if (some_ptr != NULL)" would fail and we would start  
dereferencing garbage.
