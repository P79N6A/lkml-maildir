Second issue was fixed by "ecryptfs-resolve-lower-page-unlocking-problem.patch",
but first issue was't.
[LOG]
  Function ecryptfs_do_readpage() calls flush_dcache_page(lower_page),
  but lower_page was't changed here. Even if it was changed by 
  lower_a_ops->readpage() dcache was flushed by readpage() itself.
  So remove this unnecessary line.
