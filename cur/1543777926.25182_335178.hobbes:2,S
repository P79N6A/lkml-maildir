	In turn, let me clarify a little where configfs fits in to
things.  Configfs is merely a convenient and transparent method to
communicate configuration to kernel objects.  It's not a place for
uevents, for netlink sockets, or for fancy communication.  It allows
userspace to create an in-kernel object and set/get values on that
object.  It also allows userspace and kernelspace to share the same
representation of that object and its values.
	For more complex interaction, sysfs and procfs are often more
appropriate.  While you might "configure" all known nodes in configfs,
the node up/down state might live in sysfs.  A netlink socket for
up/down events might live in procfs.  And so on.
