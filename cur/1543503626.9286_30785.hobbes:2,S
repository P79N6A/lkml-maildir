Correction : 
this happens only when going through the NAt code. 
I just tested and only time when it crashes is when one of the ends is in
NAT 
( i haven tested with both endss in NAT but thats rare to find anyways ) 
so to resume: 
kernel 2.2.10 
ip utility 
ipchains 
one of the networks is NAT-ed 
ping -R a NAT ed ip from a real ip ( it has to go through the fw ) 
or ping -R  a real ip from a NATed one 
fw has to be below hop 9 on this road otherwise it doesnt work. 
Result : complete kernel panic 
my ip nat rules are rather simple . 
so i belive anyone should be able to reproduce the problem. 
comments ? 
fixes ?

hello , 
i belive this is an old problem since this is not the first time i heard
about it. 
ping ing with ping -R from through a firewall machine make the firewall go
into kernel panic 
tried to kill idle task 
not syncing 
etc. etc. 
does anyone know a fix for the problem ? 
or a set of rules that will fix the problem ? 
i believe ping -R works only on about nine hops... what bothers me 
is that nine hops can be a lot of subnets :( 
Thanks for any help
