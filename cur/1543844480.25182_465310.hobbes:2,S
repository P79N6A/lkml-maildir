As a user-interface, "read the number from dmesg that swapon printk'd
and add that to your boot command line" is pretty damned awful.
It means that it's next to impossible for a distro installer to
support suspend-to-swapfile.  It's also incredibly fragile to rely
on that file always remaining in that part of the disk.
