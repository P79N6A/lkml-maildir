Ooooops! I did it...
Generally speaking "complete drive name" is ALREADY IN quirklist about a
month at least...
but it does not help me the same way as if it has been written on a fence
:-)
For any case I send you little attachment to check it.
("QUANTUM FIREBALLlct08 08" - that's what we are talking about)
I suspect there is some fundamental lowlevel drawback somewhere,
or there is some specific in my hardware set which makes imposible to use
2.4.0-kernel in the future at all :-)
For instance I have found that version of my Ultra66 BIOS is 1.15
while you design everything (as far as I can get it) with expectation of
ver.1.11
Sorry I'm not sure I can update BIOS ver.1.15 of my onboard
Ultra66-controller up to ver.1.29,
I never  read anything about such possibility at least.

Mike
