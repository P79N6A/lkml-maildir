I have released software on more on one occasion where I have given a 
very liberal license (like MIT), and then put a "however, if you like 
this, X would be appreciated."  I wouldn't consider it unethical if 
someone didn't obey the optional request (it's optional for a reason), 
however, it does mean that I do genuinely appreciate someone doing X.
So there is a difference between what is legal and ethical, and what is 
the nice/friendly thing to do.
