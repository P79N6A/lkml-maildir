I don't understand how this can happen ..
journal_unmap_buffer() zapping the buffer since its not attached to any
transaction. 
journal_unmap_buffer():[fs/jbd/transaction.c:1789] not on any
transaction: zap
     b_state:0x10402f b_jlist:BJ_None cpu:0 b_count:3 b_blocknr:52735707
     b_jbd:1 b_frozen_data:0000000000000000
b_committed_data:0000000000000000
     b_transaction:0 b_next_transaction:0 b_cp_transaction:0
b_trans_is_running:0
     b_trans_is_comitting:0 b_jcount:2 pg_dirty:1
journal_dirty_data() would do submit_bh() ONLY if its part of the older
transaction.
I need to take a closer look to understand the race.
BTW, is this 1k or 2k filesystem ? How easy is to reproduce the
problem ?
Thanks,
Badari
