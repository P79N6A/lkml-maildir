This is presumably active mmapped memory.  executable text.

That's a lot of active memory.

That's an awful lot of mapped memory.  Have you been altering
/proc/sys/vm/swappiness?  Has some application run berzerk
and used tons of memory?

You've lost 60 megabytes in hugepages!  Bill's patch (which is in .47)
changes the initial number of hugetlb pages to zero, which is rather
kinder.
So I don't _think_ there's a leak here.  It could be that your
normal workload fits OK ito 256 megs, but thrashes when it is
squeezed into 196 megs.
Suggest you do `echo 0 > /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages' and retest.
