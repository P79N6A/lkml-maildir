A little teaser for those that haven't tried it yet. This is the
blktrace stats of doing a dd from a device and piping to md5sum. Just
meant to test that I got the same data back with chained sglists.
Snips from the blktrace data:
  8,16   2     1302    14.958707808     0  C   R 983040 + 10240 [0]
  8,16   2     1303    14.959619712     0  D   R 1005568 + 13312 [swapper]
  8,16   2     1304    15.066257952     0  C   R 993280 + 12288 [0]
  8,16   2     1305    15.067238272     0  D   R 1018880 + 13312 [swapper]
That's completion of a 5120kb request, dispatch of a 6656kb request,
completion of a 6144kb request, and finally dispatch of a 6656kb request
again. Average io size for reading half a gig of data:
 Read Dispatches:      110,  524,288KiB
or ~4766kb average IO size. 6656 are the largest requests in this test,
it's running into the hw sg limit at that point. Just doing a plain
O_DIRECT dd from the device makes basically all requests reach the max,
giving an average io size above 6mb/request.
