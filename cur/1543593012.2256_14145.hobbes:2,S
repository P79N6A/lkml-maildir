First of all, the unit of time is the second (s), not the siemens (S).
Second, I think we're talking about different things.  I'm talking about
interfaces (/proc, ioctl, etc.) in which durations are specified in
jiffies.  This is unacceptable.
What you seem to be talking about is user-space insight into the
scheduling algorithm, which is another matter.
