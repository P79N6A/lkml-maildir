You need assign netns to netdevice after alloc_netdev().
This should fix much confusion and non-bugs mentioned in this thread.
After that struct ppp shouldn't need netns pointer as it will be netns
of it's netdevice.
current->nsproxy->net_ns while being correct in ioctl context
(it's synchronous) is easy to screwup. For example, in netfilter code netns
is taken from socket on which ioctl is done.
Regardless of netns, try_module_get() calls by hand are suspicious
and they're copied to netns init hook.
