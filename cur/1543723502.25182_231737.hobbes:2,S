This is actually an X bug, which I thought I had fixed a long time ago
when I was still doing 3Dfx stuff.
On console switch not all the state is being restored properly,
specificly the font is getting screwed up, simply reloading the font
should work fine though.
I no longer have either an X tree to easily play in, nor a 3Dfx card in
a box to test with, so I'm afraid that you're going to have to bug the X
people.

Has anyone got a reference cynic? I think I need to recalibrate myself.
