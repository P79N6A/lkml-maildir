I think you just misread.  I said that the Evil Linker has cheerfully
shipped the source code of the modified POP server.  He may not have
given you the compiler he compiled it with, wihout which the source
code is a nice piece of literature but of no engineering utility; but
that's the situation the GPL is DESIGNED TO PRODUCE.
Cheers,
