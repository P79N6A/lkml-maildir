Anyone else have any suggestions on what I could do to start debugging this 
problem? I don't like to ask again, but I figure this is too good a chance to 
miss.
I'd like to get my laptop working with 2.6, sure, but more importantly a 
problem like this that affects hardware I own is the perfect chance for me to 
poke my head into the kernel sources and start learning. ;)
