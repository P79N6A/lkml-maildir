What would you suppose time_past(xxx) to do?
I agree this calls for some action to prevent confusion in the future.
However, I'm not sure how a new macro could help here.
Andreas Dilger once did a patch to clarify the documentation of
time_[before,after] a bit.

I think there is an implicit notational convention to have the volatile 
argument, i.e. jiffies, first. This would express that the condition 
evaluates as true *before* some fixed point in time:
   if (drive->sleep && time_before(jiffies, drive->sleep))
Maybe sticking to this convention would suffice to keep the 
semantics of the condition obvious.
