No it doesn't.
Do a
	git grep '".*Linux version .*"'
on the kernel, and see just how CRAP that "get_kernel_version" test is, 
and has always been.
But let's hope that CIFS is never compiled into a SLES kernel. Because 
this isn't worth fixing at that point, and the SLES people should just fix 
their piece of crap initrd script.
And next time somebody says "random vmlinux binary" to me, I'll blacklist 
their email address. You shouldn't do initrd for "random binaries". Just 
pass the release name somewhere (maybe in the name of the binary, for 
example, and if the name doesn't have a version in it, tough titties).
