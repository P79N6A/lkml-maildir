I need this for differing Option "XkbModel" in Xorg, so I can bind to each
device it's model and has correct xev's scancodes based on model.
So I prefer to have as Phis just only BDADDR, because for me this doesn't make 
sense to have there device to which keyboard connect. Then I should have 1 
section for each receiver, which is stupid.
Section "InputDevice"
        Identifier  "Bluetooth Keyboard"
        Driver      "kbd"
        Option  "Name"  "Bluetooth HID Boot Protocol Device"
        Option  "Phis"        "BDADDR"
        Option      "XkbRules"  "xfree86"
        Option      "XkbModel"  "dinovo"
        Option      "XkbLayout" "us"
EndSection
and so on for every other BT keyboard I own.
