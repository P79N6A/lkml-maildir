Isn't this what you'd get if you accidentally removed .git/MERGE_HEAD 
while trying to resolve a merge, and then absent-mindedly described what 
you'd done in the commit message (forgetting that it ought to have 
generated the commit message for you in this situation)?
I expect the source of the bad commit is losing that, although I don't 
know any obvious way to lose it (and still have the index contents which 
you're merging).
