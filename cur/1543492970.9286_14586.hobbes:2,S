Do you really need 2G partitions?  Linux has a 2G filesize limit,
sure, but you can access low-level disk partitions beyond that easily:
there is a 64-bit lseek function to let you go beyond 2G.  Can
Informix not use that?
Other than that, no, you really are limited to 15 partitions.  There
are other ways of dividing up the drive space into smaller chunks,
however; for example, you might try out the LVM code on
http://linux.msede.com/lvm/.
