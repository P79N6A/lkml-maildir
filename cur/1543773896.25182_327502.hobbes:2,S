Personally I'm more concerned about the design issues - I can't see how
any of the other options are sustainable / workable. Things that require
maintaining their own driver base are just insane. Things that dump from
the panicing kernel are just broken. People want to be able to dump to 
disk / network / flash-ram card / god-knows-what, so we need something
that's flexible.
I don't think kdump is perfect and bug-free yet, but at least it has a 
design that looks like it'll be workable and sustainable through the future. 
Plus it's a small patch on top of kexec, which is useful in it's own right
(for fast reboot, etc) so we get to reuse a lot of code.
We could go into how crashdump itself is important (eg. first time failure 
capture is critical for customers, less downtime, I can ship you better 
data on bugs I find in test, etc, etc) but I kind of assumed most people
were convinced of that by now. Even Linus seemed to think kdump was the
sensible way forward (at KS last year), and he seems to be one of the 
most ardent sceptics of crashdump I've ever met ;-)
