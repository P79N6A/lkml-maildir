I dont think this is true. Neighter was is true in the past nor is it
desireable in all cases. We may define a range of releases, where the ABI
will be stable, but I am not sure we find a text everybody agrees on.
I do think it is not a bead idea to keep deprecated values at least
commented out, to avoid reuse, whenever possible.
Otherwise I love the idea. Have you checked back with the Glibc folks?

can we clean that up? with shifting, without shifting, with comments and without comments? I suggest to use the linuxdoc comments mandatory for the abi files.

i also suggest to think twice about using the word old somewhere.
valid-since, deprecated-after may be used in conjunction with version
identifiers. And not including deprecated symbols is also a good start.
