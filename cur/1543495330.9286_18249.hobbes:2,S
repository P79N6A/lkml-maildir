Darn... I see what happened, but how... You've got the following nice
combination:
	a) extra pointer to dentry. OK, that would normally give you
KERN_CRIT-level printk followed by forced oops.
	b) non-NULL d_parent not equal to dentry in question.
	c) NULL (or otherwise invalid) pointer in parent's d_name.
That way you got an oops trying to pass arguments to printk.
Sheesh... It may be a random memory corruption from whatever reason, but
since you have it reproducably I suspect that it's a real dcache corruption.
Could you try the following:
--- fs/dcache.c	Thu Apr 29 07:48:57 1999
+++ fs/dcache.c.new	Tue May 11 04:21:13 1999

+			kdev_t_to_nr(dentry->d_inode->i_dev));
+	}
+	if (dentry->d_name)
+		printk(KERN_CRIT " d_name.name=%s\n", dentry->d_name.name);
+	if (dentry->d_parent && dentry->d_parent->d_name)
+		printk(KERN_CRIT " parent: d_name.name=%s\n",
+			dentry->d_parent->d_name.name);
 	*(int *)0 = 0;	
 }
 
... and look what it will give. inode number and device may at least hint
where the hell it happens.
	It's not the first report indicating that something is wrong with
dcache and this one at least may narrow the things down. Please, post the
resulting log as soon as you'll reproduce the oops with the patched
variant in place, OK?
