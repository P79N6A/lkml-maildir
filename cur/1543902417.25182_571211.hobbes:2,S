I suppose low/highmem is an issue on x86? I was reading the tail packing 
paper Dave posted a link to earlier:
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/shaggy/OLS-2006/kleikamp.pdf
It says that highmem is not an issue due to no such thing as highmem even 
existing on the machines with support for larger hard pagesizes, but this 
wouldn't hold for soft pages. Sort of went "damn" in an x86 context upon 
reading that.
Rene.
