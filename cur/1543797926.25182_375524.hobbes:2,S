Thanks a lot for your answer!
I just tried out interruptible_sleep_on(), but couriously I got the same delay as before. On the hardware side, everything seems to be okay, because the data I'm transferring is relayed to a printhead of a laser printer (by an FPGA on the PCI-Board), whose LEDs light up as expected. The programmer of the FPGA (sitting next to me) says there would be no interrupt in the case of an error (so probably I should sleep with a timeout). But as there is an interrupt (and MY_DMA_COUNT_REGISTER contains really 0) in fact, I think the dma transfer succeeds, or could that be misleading? The only problem seems to be, that the interrupt comes much later, if I put the user process to sleep than let it do busy waiting. Do you have any idea, what could cause this strange behaviour? Could it be concerned with my SMP kernel (I use a processor with 2 cores)?
At first I used interruptible_sleep_on(), but then I changed to wait_event_interruptible(), because I read that the probability of a race condition is higher than with wait_event_interruptible(), so one shouldn't use this function any longer. Do you think interruptible_sleep_on() is okay for this case?
Kind regards,
Burkhard
