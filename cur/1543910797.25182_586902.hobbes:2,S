We reclaim the clean pages that there are (removing the executable 
pages from memory) and then we do writeback.
The quick OOM is due to throttling not working right AFAIK.

Yes and that occurs now too.

Cleaning dirty pages through writeout consumes memory. Writing dirty pages 
out early makes the memory situation even worse.
