All these processes lying around eating memory may be what causes the
do_try_to_free_pages phenomenon.  Yes, there's something wrong with his
configuration, but that doesn't exclude the possibility of something being
wrong with his system.
This phenomenon has been witnessed by myself and Chip Salzenberg, I
believe he posted something relevant to this a few days ago.  Since
2.2.16, my run-in test software (VA-CTCS, otherwise known as Cerberus)
can cause this message to appear within 2 minutes of crunching on a box.

I think Chip found a combination of experimental patches that makes it go
away, see his posting a couple days ago.  The pausing he mentioned was
accompanied by the same message this person has seen.
