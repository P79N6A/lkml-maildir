Well I wrote the driver. Thanks for the clarification. If I recall correctly I 
looked how this part should be done from others drivers. Now while checking
what happened to the file, seems Rafael added something related.

maybe it does exist?  CPU_DOWN_PREPARE ?
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=blob;f=Documentation/cpu-hotplug.txt;hb=HEAD
Unfortunately I'm not very familiar with this, calling the 
coretemp_device_remove from CPU_DOWN_PREPARE would help? Looking at microcode 
driver, seems it just hide sysfs interface from user.
Thanks,
Rudolf
