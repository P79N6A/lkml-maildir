Ok. That may be a problem for i386. After the removal of the GFP_DMA 
and ZONE_DMA stuff it is then be possible to redefine ZONE_DMA (or 
whatever we may call it ZONE_RESERVE?) to an arbitrary size a the 
beginning of memory. Then alloc_pages_range() can dynamically decide to 
tap that pool if necessary. I already have checks for ZONE_DMA and 
ZONE_DMA32 in there. If we just rename those then what you wanted would 
be there. If additional memory pools are available then they
are used if the allocation restrictions fit to avoid a lengthy search.
This may mean that i386 and x86_64 will still have two zones. Its somewhat 
better.
However, on IA64 we would not need this since our DMA limit has been 
4GB in the past.
