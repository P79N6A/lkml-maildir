Ramdisk does reserve its buffers, at least until you start deleting
files on the ramdisk (which is the only place we would clear the
protected flag).

Adding swap is the only recommended the way to avoid painful VM deaths
like this, I'm afraid.  Otherwise, just make the ramdisk as small as
possible: using mke2fs options to reduce the number of inodes on the
ramdisk, or even using the minix fs, might help.
