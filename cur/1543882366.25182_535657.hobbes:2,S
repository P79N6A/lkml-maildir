I've tested the patch on a Pavillon zv5000 laptop (amd64) and
apparently the kernel still hangs when one of the script in the
initramfs [0] tries to run udevsettle.
Booting with noapic doesn't seem to help, and differently from the
2.6.21-rc6-rt0 release [1] this time the kernel won't boot even with
qemu.
Here's the config I used:
