If you are sooo attached to this, just keep a distribution for which
vendors give you drivers. But when the vendor decides the product has to
die to get you to buy the next "completely redone" (== minor fixes and
updates) version, you are stranded for good.

And when 2.7 opens, very few developers will tend 2.6; and as 2.7 diverges
from it, fewer and fewer fixes will find their way back. And so you finally
get a rock-stable (== unchanging) 2.6, but hopelessly out of date and thus
unfixable (if nothing else because there are no people around who remember
how it worked).
