Subject: [RFC][PATCH 03/30] check for null vfsmount in dentry_open()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/8/482

Make sure no-one calls dentry_open with a NULL vfsmount argument and crap
out with a stacktrace otherwise.  A NULL file->f_vfsmnt has always been
problematic, but with the per-mount r/o tracking we can't accept anymore
at all.
