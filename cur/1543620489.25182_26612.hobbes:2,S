It seems to me that there was an issue with timers not being set up 
properly, or changing their settings during startup, which could cause a 
machine to behave like it was running slow.  On more recent 2.2.x kernels 
you would see a line like 'timer configuration lost' in dmesg, which meant 
that the computer had the problem, and a workaround was being implimented. 
On kernels that didn't detect the timer problem you could sometimes boot 
with no problem, but other times you'd get a kernel that seemed to run very 
slowly.
I don't remember if it affected the bogomips reporting, but I would think 
that it could.
BTW, I think that the kernels I had the problems with were pre 2.2.17, 
though I'm not positive. 2.2.20 and 2.2.19 do not exhibit the problem. i.e. 
they detect the problem and work around it.
