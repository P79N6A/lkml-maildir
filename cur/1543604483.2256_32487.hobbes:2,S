Okay, I just tried this, and the pertinant results were: 
$ gdb find
GNU gdb 4.18

This GDB was configured as "ppc-yellowdog-linux"...(no debugging symbols
found)...
(gdb) attach 31075
Attaching to program: /usr/bin/find, Pid 31075
At this point it hangs and ctrl-C has no effect and I have to kill it from
another console.
Attaching to another program worked fine.
Any other ideas?
Chris
