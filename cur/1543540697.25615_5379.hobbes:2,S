He has.  He also pointed out how it was broken and how to fix it;  at that
point my impression was tytso had the fix in his driver and it would be in
the next released version.

At the very least, you need an additional serial_in(info, UART_RX); here
(which will read the 0 byte that ends up in our FIFO when a break is
received).  I am not sure that will work as it should though.

That is the yucky version.  serial.c really should check sysrq_enabled
itself.
