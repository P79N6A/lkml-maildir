In short, you have a dataflow model with infinite parallelism,
implemented using threads of control mapped willy-nilly onto the
underlying hardware.  This has not proven to be a successful model in
the past.

That's a big part of why Linux scales poorly for workloads that
involve a large volume of in-flight I/O transactions.  Unless you
essentially lock one application thread to each CPU core, with a
complete understanding of its cache sharing and latency relationships
to all the other cores, and do your own userspace I/O scheduling and
dispatching state machine -- which is what all industrial-strength
databases and other sorts of transaction engines currently do -- you
get the same old best-effort context-thrashing scheduler we've had
since Solaris 2.0.
Let's do something genuinely better this time, OK?
Cheers,
