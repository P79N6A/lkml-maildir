Argh, can't remember, can't find it with archive grep.  I just have a
mental note that it got fixed somehow.  Perhaps by uprevving the compiler
version?  We certainly have a ton of uninitialised DEFINE_PER_CPUs in there
nowadays and people's kernels aren't crashing.
Rusty, do you recall if/how we fixed the
DEFINE_PER_CPU-needs-explicit-initialisation thing?
