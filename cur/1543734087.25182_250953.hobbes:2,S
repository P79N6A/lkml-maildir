I'd be very surprised if you're wrong.
I remarked on that in the ChangeLog comment: "Though I suppose
it's possible that we'll find that vmscan makes better progress with
trylocks than spinning - we're free to choose trylocks again if so."
I'm quite content to go back to a trylock in page_referenced_one - and
in try_to_unmap_one?  But yours is the first report of an issue there,
so I'm inclined to wait for more reports (which should come flooding in
now you mention it!), and input from those with a better grasp than I
of how vmscan pans out in practice (Andrew, Nick, Con spring to mind).
