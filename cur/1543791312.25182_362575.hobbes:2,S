Well I think it can satisfy hugepage allocations simply because
we can be reasonably sure of being able to free contiguous regions.
Of course it will be memory no longer easily reclaimable, same as
the case for the frag patches. Nor would be name ZONE_REMOVABLE any
longer be the most appropriate!
But my point is, the basic mechanism is there and is workable.
Hugepages and memory unplug are the two main reasons for IBM to be
pushing this AFAIKS.
