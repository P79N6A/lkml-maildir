Background:  I get a kernel panic when I boot 2.4.2{2,3,4} with ACPI on
my dual-processor Abit VP6.  Compiling the kernel with CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB
turned on allows it to boot, as does booting with "idle=poll".
I do not believe that the panic occurs anywhere in the ACPI code.  From
what I can tell, the transition to ACPI mode causes the idle thread on
the other processor to panic.
I believe that I have identified the line of code that triggers the
panic.  It is the actual transition to ACPI mode at
drivers/acpi/hardware/hwacpi.c, line 143.  If I insert an infinite loop
before the call to acpi_os_write_port, the boot process simply hangs.
If I move the loop below the call to acpi_os_write_port, I get the same
old panic message.
How can I debug this further?
Thanks!
