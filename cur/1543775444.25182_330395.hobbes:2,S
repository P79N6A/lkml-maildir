Trasnlation:  They really, honestly, have no way at all of knowing if my 
GPG-encrypted 450 meg tarball violates their terms.  They have legally 
given themselves the right to delete it just because they think it might 
violate their terms, but it wouldn't make sense for them to delete a 
file called "backup.tar.bz2.gpg" when there are no doubt a lot of other 
encrypted files on their servers.  It wouldn't make sense because they 
would either have to delete such files completely at random, or they'd 
have to delete all of them at once.
Further translation:  This was probably put here to keep the lawyers 
happy.  They don't want to be held liable for illegal stuff on their 
servers, for example, so they have at least spelled out, in legalese, 
that illegal stuff (and probably a few other categories) is not allowed 
on their servers, and that encyrpting it doesn't magically make it legal.
This kind of stuff makes lawyers happy, even if it *practically* does 
nothing at all.
Regardless, I feel reasonably safe with a backup there.  If I ever start 
to feel unsafe, I can always back up the most critical stuff to gmail, 
and create a few permanent copies on DVDs.  But I feel considerably 
safer with Streamload than with Gmail, because using Gmail for my own 
custom backup app directly violates their terms of service.
I think we should officially kill this particular thread.
