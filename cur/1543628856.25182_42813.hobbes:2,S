But that's kind of the point.  You can *never* do:
	ptr = lookup("foo");
	if (!ptr) {
		if (request_module("mymod-foo") == 0)
			ptr = lookup("foo");
		else
			goto out;
	}
	... Assume ptr is non-null...

Yes, we don't try to cache failures, and you must *never* loop on request_module.

Yes, and modules pulled in indirectly (see "pre-install")...

I had some code to do this and threw it out.  It assumes alot about the nature
of modprobe (ie. won't get reparented to init).  Having a special inherited
"I am modprobe" flag in the task struct which is inherited across exec & fork,
and is checked in request_module is the "correct" way.  Barf.

<SIGH>.
Wanna get ambitious?  Replace all occurances of:
	ptr = find(xxx);
	if (!ptr && request_module(SOMENAME) == 0)
		ptr = find(xxx);
With a more generic global registration mechanism:
	/* Find in list, try loading module (sleeps) */
	void *find_feature(const char *, int);
	/* Static registration of feature */
	#define FEATURE(name, desc, feature) ...
	/* Dynamic registration of feature */
	int feature(const char *name, int desc, void *feature);
	void unfeature(const char *name, int desc);
Both module loading and the boot code gather and register all the
FEATUREs mentioned in the macro.  modprobe then loads by FEATURE,
not module name.
If we then go down the path that FreeBSD is, then we can have a
context during soft interrupts, allowing us to sleep almost anywhere.
This means we can, for example on receipt of a network packet:
	struct packet_type *ptype;
	ptype = find_feature("net-packet-type", skb->protocol);
	...
ie. As IPX packets come in, we load the ipx module.
This should give us the microkernel we're all waiting for!
