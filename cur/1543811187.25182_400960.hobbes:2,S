I totally agree with the fact that the Linux driver gets the ports wrong
when compared to the BIOS, Windows and surely contradicts the port
numbers printed on the board. I doubt we all got samples on the one
bad batch...
It *is* a real problem and if the solution is correct then I support it.
Maybe we need a quick feedback from current users: do you guys find
that the ports are detected as they are labelled (white silk screen)
on the board or do they show up out of order (as listed above by
Milan)?
