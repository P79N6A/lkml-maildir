Ok, I've solved my problem by changing SATA cables. I have tested controller 
with massive I/O operations with both enabled and disabled write-caching. 
Admittedly next day TK server crashed with NMI, parity errors and so on, but 
now I have new mainboard, new riser and everything works just fine. 
I use tw_cli to maintain the RAID. 
Regards
