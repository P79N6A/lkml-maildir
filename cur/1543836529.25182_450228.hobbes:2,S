to some degree the in kernel balancer cannot really make the level of decisions that a
userspace balancer can make, at least not without making all kernel developers vomit ;)
(for example the userspace balancer looks in /proc/interrupts and parses that to see
which interrupts are used by networking versus which by storage etc, and has different
balancing policies for those and other classes; the networking policy basically comes down to
"pin the interrupt unless some higher networking interrupt really gets in the way")
