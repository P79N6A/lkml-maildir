However, the kfifo_get()/kfifo_put() interfaces use the internal lock,
which cannot be used by the caller to protect other code surrounding
the call to kfifo_get()/kfifo_put().  See for example the ISCSI use,
where they have a session->lock that, among other things, protects their
__kfifo_get()/__kfifo_put() calls.

If we require the caller to supply the locks for __kfifo_get() and
__kfifo_put(), then we have -both- correctness -and- better performance.
And the only current user of __kfifo_get()/__kfifo_put() stated that
they could easily expand their session->lock to cover all such calls,
and that doing so would not hurt their performance.
So, are you sure?  And if so, why?
						Thanx, Paul
