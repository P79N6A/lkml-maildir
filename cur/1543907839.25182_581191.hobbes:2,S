Based on recent discussion, it's pretty clear that there's a lot of 
confusion about this.  A lot of people (myself included, until I thought 
about it long and hard) will reasonably assume that calling 
atomic_read() will actually read the value from memory.  Leaving out the 
volatile declaration seems like a pessimization to me.  If you force 
people to use barrier() everywhere they're working with atomic_t, it 
will force re-reads of all the non-atomic data in use as well, which 
will cause more memory fetches of things that generally don't need 
barrier().  That and it's a bug waiting to happen.
Andi -- your thoughts on the matter?
