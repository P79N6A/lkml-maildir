   Erm, you forgot COW semantics. The accesses to buffer are actually all
   going to the same physical address. As CPU caches work on physical
   addresses AFAIK (everything else would be just stupid ;-), there are
   no cache misses (disregarding a few produced by IRQs/scheduling etc.).
ROFL, ignore that part of my postings then :-)
