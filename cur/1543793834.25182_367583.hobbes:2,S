I worry that this is just adding more thrash to a historically unstable
implementation.  How long do we users have to wait for a swsusp
implementation where we don't have to worry about breaking from one
kernel release to the next?
I agree with this post 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/9/15/125
 and note that
making too large of a change thrashes the users a lot and if it doesn't
solve a real problem or enable something critical, why make the changes?
