Neither do I now but not for your reasons :)
I looked again we are o.k. but just barely.  mmput explicitly checks
to see if it is freeing the swap_mm, and fixes if we are.  It is a
nasty interplay with the swap_mm global, but the code is correct.
My apologies for freaking out I but I couldn't imagine mmput doing
something like that.
