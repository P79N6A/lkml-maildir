Why do you think the kernel uses "-fno-strict-aliasing"?
The gcc people are more interested in trying to find out what can be
allowed by the c99 specs than about making things actually _work_. The
aliasing code in particular is not even worth enabling, it's just not
possible to sanely tell gcc when some things can alias.

The "problem" is that we inline the memcpy(), at which point gcc won't
care about the fact that it can alias, so they'll just re-order
everything and claim it's out own fault.  Even though there is no sane
way for us to even tell gcc about it. 
I tried to get a sane way a few years ago, and the gcc developers really
didn't care about the real world in this area. I'd be surprised if that
had changed, judging by the replies I have already seen.
I'm not going to bother to fight it.
