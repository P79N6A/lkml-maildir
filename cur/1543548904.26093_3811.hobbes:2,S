Hi,
I'm trying to figure out a way to immediately boot a 
new kernel from within a running system.  I do not
care about gracefully shutting down the first kernel..
once I decide to run the new kernel, I'll abandon the
first.
I'm running from a system that consists of a kernel + 
initrd, and I'm running completely from the ramdisk.  
No disk, no lilo.  This is a PowerPC system.
Let's say I fetch a znetboot.initrd from somewhere.  
How do I get this new system to boot from my running
system?
Another way to look at this is that I want to use the 
first Linux kernel as a boot loader for the second.
Some of the issues I see so far...  I need to get the
znetboot.initrd image into contiguous physical memory,
without having previously reserved a sufficiently large
space, so I can force a jump to the proper entry point, 
and initiate the normal Linux boot.  It's trivial to
get the image into a contiguous virtual space, but how
does one allocate several megabytes of contiguous RAM
in physical space, on the fly in a running system?
Please CC: replies to me as I'm not subscribed to this

Thanks,
Frank.
