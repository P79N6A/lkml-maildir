When you do your first submission can you please submit the minimal
possible configuration.
I tried enabling the AVM!Fritz and I could see that with this
driver alone the following files got build:
avm_fritz.c layer3.c l3_udss1.c capi.c contr.c listen.c appl.c
plci.c app_plci.c ncci.c
asn1.c asn1_aoc.c asn1_comp.c asn1_generic.c asn1_diversion.c asn1_basic_service.c asn1_address.c asn1_enc.c
capi_enc.c supp_serv.c core.c stack.c udevice.c helper.c debug.c fsm.c channel.c l3helper.c sysfs_obj.c
sysfs_inst.c sysfs_st.c dtmf.c isac.c arcofi.c
layer1.c layer2.c tei.c
x25_dte.c x25_l3.c
And that a *lot* to review in one go.
So if you could squeze that down to less files it would be nice.
And only one simple HW drivers (I randomly selected avm_fritz above).
When we get this in shape you can follow up with more HW drivers.
Thanks,
