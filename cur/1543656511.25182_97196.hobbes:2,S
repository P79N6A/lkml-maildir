Those kind of NDA's are quite normal. You'll see them elsewhere too. You
get this maze of NDA's between vendors about hardware flaws. So promise 
might do a workaround for an ibm disk but have NDA's with IBM that says
they can't tell people. (Thats an example I'm not saying there is a real
IBM case)
Ditto with AGP and AMD for example. They have magic fixup registers for
timings, but won't tell us the fixups for various vendors cards (which
is dumb because its not hard to find out in windows!)
