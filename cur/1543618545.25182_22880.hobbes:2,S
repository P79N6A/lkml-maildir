You should check your /var/log/messages directly for this nifty little
message. 
kernel: ACPI: APM is already active, exiting
If you compiled in apm at the time you did that test,  acpi wasn't even
active and thus the special athlon disconnect patch wasn't even
working.   So all of that better cooling would be psychoschomatic.  
Wouldn't be the first time better cooling/performance was all in the
head of the person using the hardware...although if you didn't have apm
compiled in then none of this matters and it was all working. But i
doubt that is true due to the 42C idle after some use no matter which
kernel was being used.  
Furthermore, I haven't heard of anyone where the patch actually makes an
improvement in temp with the patch.  But i have heard of people saying
it affected performance detrimentally. If it is helping and the cpu fans
decrease due to the lower temp, add fan speeds in different loads/temps
to reflect this.  
lowering the fan speed and thus noise is more than a welcome change.
