It's been a long time since disks were so slow that compression speeded
things up.
_uncompression_ is often faster than disk speeds, but that's a
fundamentally easier problem to solve. That means that a mostly read-only
medium tends to work better with compressed contents, but in this case we
have a write-once, read-once thing where compression is likely to lose.
Yes, laptops have slow disks, but they often have slow memory and seldom
have the fastest CPU's available.
