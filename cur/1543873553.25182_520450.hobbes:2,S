Yes, for vserver the pid namespace is a good proxy for resource
control groupings. But my point was that it's not universally
suitable.

Right, I think those diagrams agree with the point I wanted to make -
that resource control shouldn't be tied to the pid namespace.

There are some things that benefit from having an abstract
container-like object available to store state, e.g. "is this
container deleted?", "should userspace get a callback when this
container is empty?". But this indirection object wouldn't need to be
on the fast path for subsystem access to their per-taskgroup state.

OK, so shouldn't that be listed as an overhead for your rcfs version
too? In practice, most subsystems that I've written tend to have the
subsys object at the beginning of the per-subsys state, so X = 0 and
is optimized out by the compiler. Even if it wasn't, X is constant and
so won't hurt much or at all.

That's an implementation detail - we have more important points to
agree on right now ...
