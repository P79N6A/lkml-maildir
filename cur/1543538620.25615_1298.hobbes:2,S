The ironic thing is that it _is_ identical in almost every block device - 
each of which adds the appropriate start_sect value to the sector in each 
request, then treats it as a request on the raw device. 
It's only in the cache that it's broken.
We're doing the partition translation at the wrong level. We should shift 
it up so that the cache is coherent, and the same partition munging doesn't 
have to be replicated in _every_ block device which wants to handle 
partitions.
