Ok, now we have reached the absurd.  UBI quite fundamentally cannot do
wear leveling as good as LogFS can.  Simply because UBI has zero
knowledge of the _contents_ of its blocks.  Knowing whether a block is
90% garbage or not makes a great difference.
Also LogFS currently requires erasesizes of 2^n.
Thomas, I can give you my opinion on this flamewar in private - after
you have cooled off.
