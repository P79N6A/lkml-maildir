No, it is designed this way on purpose.  Think about devices that can be
added or removed at any point in time.  Failing a module load if a
device isn't present at this point in time is not good if the device is
plugged in a while later.
It also would not allow you to bind a driver to a device while the
kernel is running that the driver doesn't originally know about.  See
the pci sysfs file "new_id" for how you can do this today.  If we didn't
allow the driver to load that would not be possible at all.

Why not just build this in the kernel?  Once the driver is bound to the
device, the user can eventually press a key.  Perhaps make your timeout
longer (1 minute)?

Run your dhcp connect script after the device is bound to the driver
through the hotplug interface (the default hotplug scripts do this
today.)  No waiting, no guessing, no additional scripting, it just works
exactly when the device is ready for it to work.

Sorry, but your situation is very unusual, and based on my suggestions,
I don't think it is needed.
But hey, you have the source, if you don't like it, feel free to change
the code :)
