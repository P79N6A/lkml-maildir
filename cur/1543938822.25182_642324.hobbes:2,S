the original code was 63 but 63 is 128/2-1 so to not change the
original idea of 'use a half size in this case' I made it like
that.

just after that poin in the original code a call to kallsyms_lookup_name
is done - so i think it could be an overflow (of course it depends
on what *exactly* the name is being searched, and Paulo - I didn't
managed to get *the whole picture* of what is going on in this
code - so the thoughs were like: kallsyms_lookup_name could find
a quite long name restricted by KSYM_NAME_LEN (dunno how it could
happens - due to buggy code or due to memory corruption outside,
it does not matter - the only matter - it *could* find that long
name).
Anyway - it's just an attempt ;) we always could drop it far-far away ;)

Thanks a lot for review Paulo!
