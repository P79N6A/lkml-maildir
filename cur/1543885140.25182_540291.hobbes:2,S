Hi forward this message to dri-devel Mailing List, where you could find
more tester on i815 DRI drives .
I hope I don't had made a loop :)

Took way longer than I'd have wanted it to (nice daughter and stuff ;),
but here it is.
- add .suspend handler and pci_set_power_state() calls
- add i815-specific function agp_i815_remember_state() to remember important
  i815 register values
- add generic DEBUG_AGP_PM framework which will allow people to resume properly
  and help identify which registers need attention
- add obvious and detailed log message to make people sit up and take notice
  about long-standing AGP resume issues
- spelling fixes
Patch against 2.6.21-rc7-mm2, my Inspiron 8000 (i815 with Radeon AGP card,
internal Intel VGA unit NOT active) resumes fine with both
either i815-specific register saving or generic DEBUG_AGP_PM mechanism enabled.
(of course my notebook needs vbetool post and manual saving of video card
PCI space, too, but even when doing all this I still had X.org lockups before
whenever DRI/3D was enabled)
After resume I'm now still able to run both glxgears and glxinfo without
anomalies.
Right now all I care about is that this gets into mainline relatively soon,
since I'm rather certain that many other machines suffer from similar
AGP resume lockup issues that could be debugged this way (e.g. some Thinkpads,
as witnessed accidentally via IRC chats, and from the well-known "don't enable
DRI, that will lock up on resume!" chants).
Yes, this code is a cludge and somewhat far from a nicely generic
extended PCI space resume framework, but we've spent almost 10 (TEN!) years
without anything even remotely resembling a working cludge for
AGP suspend/resume in combination with DRI, so...
Feel free to offer thoughts on how this missing generic extended PCI space
restore functionality could be implemented, to be used by intel-agp and
various other drivers. No promise that it will be me who implements that,
though ;)
> Whitelist entry would still be welcome.
OK, I'll work on this next.
Thanks!
