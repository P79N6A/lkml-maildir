Dynamically handler registration seemed a good idea to me when I wrote
the original code, but there never was a real-world user for all I know,
so I'm fine with removing the rwlock. (The rest of the code can stay the
same.)

I would just remove the simple_ to get xattr_register, xattr_unregister,
xattr_resolve_name, xattr_handler.
simple_xattr_list makes no sense in the general case, so this seems to
fit.
If we decide to remove dynamic handler registration, simple_xattr_list
should go as well, and the listxattr iops can enumerate all existing
handlers explicitly.
