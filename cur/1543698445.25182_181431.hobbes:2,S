No, a break would be wrong: The test detects already dead tasks that are 
still listed in the task list. If such a task is found, then it 
shouldn't be listed in /proc/, but the readdir call should continue to 
scan the task list.
But I don't understand the oops:
__exit_sighand clears current->sighand, and then in the next line 
__unhash_process removes the thread from the task list. But that's under 
write_lock_irq(&tasklist_lock), and get_tid_list runs under 
read_lock(&tasklist_lock). It should be impossible that ->sighand is 
NULL and the task is still listed in the task list.
