Perhaps they weren't working properly in 2.6.6, or something else is 
buggy in
2.6.9. 16MB in 2.6.9 should definitely give a a larger atomic reserve 
than 900K
in 2.6.6... so if it isn't an issue with network buffer behaviour, then the
only other possibility AFAIKS is that page reclaim latency or efficiency has
got much worse. This would be unlikely as it should cause problems and
regressions on other workloads.
