Doesn't seem to work here, but maybe I'm doing something wrong.
I set up cpuset "all" containing cpu 0-1 (all, 1.something cpus I have;)
exactly as you created grp_a.  I then creaded sub-groups mikeg and root,
and gave them 20% and 80% sub-group/cpu_quota respectively, and plunked
one shell in mikeg/tasks, and two in root/tasks.
In each root shell, I started a proggy that munches ~80% cpu.
top - 10:51:12 up 32 min, 10 users,  load average: 2.00, 2.81, 2.69
Tasks: 114 total,   3 running, 111 sleeping,   0 stopped,   0 zombie
Cpu(s): 79.7% us,  0.0% sy,  0.0% ni, 20.3% id,  0.0% wa,  0.0% hi,  0.0% si
  PID USER      PR  NI  VIRT  RES  SHR S %CPU %MEM    TIME+  COMMAND
 6503 root      15   0  1368  276  228 S   79  0.0   0:31.03 f
 6504 root      15   0  1368  280  228 R   78  0.0   0:29.17 f
I then add the same to the mikeg shell.
top - 10:54:37 up 35 min, 10 users,  load average: 3.80, 2.95, 2.74
Tasks: 115 total,   6 running, 109 sleeping,   0 stopped,   0 zombie
Cpu(s): 94.7% us,  0.5% sy,  0.0% ni,  4.8% id,  0.0% wa,  0.0% hi,  0.0% si
  PID USER      PR  NI  VIRT  RES  SHR S %CPU %MEM    TIME+  COMMAND
 6503 root      15   0  1368  276  228 S   65  0.0   3:12.86 f
 6505 mikeg     15   0  1368  276  228 R   64  0.0   0:11.77 f
 6504 root      16   0  1368  280  228 R   59  0.0   3:10.58 f
If I add a third to root, the percentages go to roughly 50% per.
