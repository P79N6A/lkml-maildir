Remove the BROKEN, and it builds, and runs just fine on most systems.
(Or it least it did, until this intentional breakage occured).

Yes. Don't remove symbols that are referenced by code in the rest of the
tree (even if it isn't buildable).  It's not as though leaving those
symbols there breaks anything, or even bloats the kernel.

At least 2 distros are carrying patches removing the BROKEN attribute
on the advansys Kconfig for some architectures. The users of those kernels
using their advansys controllers without any issue at all.
Even if this were not the case, randomly removing bits of a driver so that
it has no chance of working isn't how we schedule removal.
