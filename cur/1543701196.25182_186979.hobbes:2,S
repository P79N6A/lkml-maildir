I've had the same problem.  I've tried using radeonfb and it's never 
worked yet since 2.5.69.  In 2.6.0, no matter what mode I select, I get 
a horizontal frequency of 140kHz and a ~90Hz vertical sync.  My monitor 
blanks and pops up the on-screen menu with the horizontal frequency 
high-lighted in red.  My monitor supports up to 110kHz horizontal 
according to my X log.
I compiled just the vesafb in as well, but it does the exact same 
thing.  It doesn't matter what values or modes I put in the vga/video 
parameter.  Only the text mode works now, and after only 2 days uptime 
I've noticed I no longer have the full vertical screen.  When I type, 
random text or colored/flashing blocks appear in the bottom (roughly) 
1/5th of the screen.  Actually, anytime I run an ncurse app in my 
console, it gets smaller.  Now my console only occupies 1/2 the screen, 
but it doesn't seem to get any smaller than that.  I'm using the boot 
parameter "vga=0x132".
My point is maybe your screen isn't blank, but rather the horizontal 
frequency is out of your monitor's range?
Certainly, something has changed, because with 2.6.0-test11 I was 
running "vga=0x31B video=vesafb:ywrap" and it worked great, whereas now 
it doesn't work at all with any fb modes.
