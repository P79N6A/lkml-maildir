Ok, as I'm converting the drivers, I find that some have the option of
modular compilation, like isapnp and irda. In theory, it seems that each
of the bus drivers could be compiled modular. But, how do you define it in
the section?
I was thinking something like this:
#ifdef MODULE
#define __devsubsys_init(fn) \
	module_init(fn);
#else
#define __devsubsys_init(fn) \
	static initcall_t __devsubsys_##fn __devsubsys_call = fn;
#endif
Thoughts?
