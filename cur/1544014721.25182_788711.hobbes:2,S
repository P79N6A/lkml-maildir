Why not do the reset in mmc_omap_irq() like the other resets?
e.g.
static irqreturn_t mmc_omap_irq(int irq, void *dev_id)
{
	struct mmc_omap_host *host = dev_id;
	struct mmc_data *data;
	int end_cmd = 0, end_trans = 0, status;
	if (host->cmd == NULL && host->data == NULL) {
		OMAP_HSMMC_WRITE(host->base, STAT,
			OMAP_HSMMC_READ(host->base, STAT));
		return IRQ_HANDLED;
	}
	data = host->data;
	status = OMAP_HSMMC_READ(host->base, STAT);
	dev_dbg(mmc_dev(host->mmc), "IRQ Status is %x\n", status);
	if (status & ERR) {
#ifdef CONFIG_MMC_DEBUG
		mmc_omap_report_irq(host, status);
#endif
		if ((status & CMD_TIMEOUT) ||
			(status & CMD_CRC)) {
			if (host->cmd) {
				if (status & CMD_TIMEOUT) {
					OMAP_HSMMC_WRITE(host->base, SYSCTL,
						OMAP_HSMMC_READ(host->base,
								SYSCTL) | SRC);
					while (OMAP_HSMMC_READ(host->base,
							SYSCTL) & SRC)
						;
					host->cmd->error = -ETIMEDOUT;
				} else {
					host->cmd->error = -EILSEQ;
				}
				end_cmd = 1;
			}
-			if (host->data)
+			if (host->data) {
				mmc_dma_cleanup(host);
+				OMAP_HSMMC_WRITE(host->base, SYSCTL,
+					OMAP_HSMMC_READ(host->base,
+							SYSCTL) | SRD);

		}

					mmc_dma_cleanup(host);

					host->data->error = -EILSEQ;
