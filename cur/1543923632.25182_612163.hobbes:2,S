Yes, that looks fine. It also matches the kinds of things drivers already 
have to do (ie enable DMA, MSI etc), both conceptually and from a purely 
syntactic/practical standpoint.
I think mmconfig and MSI have a lot in common, in that both are relatively 
new features and both have had issues that made them not work well.

Well, let's see if "pci_enable_mmconfig()" works out first. There probably 
aren't more than a few drivers that would be interested in this anyway, so 
it's probably fine.
And by the time mmconfig is commonly used, probably all the teething 
problems are long gone, so we could plan on a "in five years, maybe we 
could even enable it by default" thing?
