	Hi Marcelo,
Can we please have a fix for vesafb in the next -pre*? Currently it maps 8
times too much memory due to a bits/bytes confusion.
For your convenience, I rediffed against the latest trees and appended the
patch below. This includes the fixed vram size handling and the documentation
for the new vram parameter.
Thanks!
