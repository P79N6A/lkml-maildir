Hi
sorry for late responce.
but I thought I should investigate BSD behavior at first.
and I've installed FreeBSD on my PC and tested it.
I'll post this test case and my proposal patch soon.

BSD inherit maxrss at exec(), but Jiri's patch doesn't.

xacct is linux specific feature.
it doesn't need other os compatibility.

your idea is nice. but it is incompatibility to bsd.
I beilieve incompatibility of compatibility feature is worthless.
BSD return 1GB at above case. then I like this behavior.

you are absolutely right.
I was crap thinking. thanks clarification.
