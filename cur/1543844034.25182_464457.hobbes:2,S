Stuart -- thanks, added for man-pages-2.41.
Interestingly, at this point in the man pages source there
is the following commented out text:
.\" FIXME . Is it a good idea to document that? It is a dubious feature.
.\" On
.\" .B SOCK_STREAM
.\" sockets,
.\" .I IP_RECVERR
.\" has slightly different semantics. Instead of
.\" saving the errors for the next timeout, it passes all incoming
.\" errors immediately to the user.
.\" This might be useful for very short-lived TCP connections which
.\" need fast error handling. Use this option with care:
.\" it makes TCP unreliable
.\" by not allowing it to recover properly from routing
.\" shifts and other normal
.\" conditions and breaks the protocol specification.
Cheers,
Michael
