fsync() on the file(s) in the directory then fsync() on the directory
itself. For this, one can open the directory as though it was
just a file, you don't need opendir().
FYI, this is what `man fsync` promises. It may be broken. Last
time I checked, one needed to umount() the file-system to make
sure the directories were updated. The problem may be that
somebody can have either the directory or a file within it
open. Until they get out, the directory entry may not actually
be finalized. Oh,... Unix/Linux doesn't have "folders". That's
some M$ thing. Real operating systems have directories. Your
GUI may have folders, just like it may have little houses,
trash-cans, red hats, and other odd widgets. However, the
operating system doesn't.
