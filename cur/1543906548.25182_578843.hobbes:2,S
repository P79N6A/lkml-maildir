So we have hardware which has problems when we are not doing the
handoff, and hardware which has
problems when we are  doing the handoff...
What is the best way to solve the problem? Maybe a kernel parameter, a
config flag or an automatic
hardware dependent check of the system?
In fact it is hard to find a solution which works for both as long as
the hardware has this bugs.
Thanks
