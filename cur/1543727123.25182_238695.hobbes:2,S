Subject: [RFC][PATCH] Updated RCU documentation improvement
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/8/4/119

Hello!
Updated based on feedback, and to apply to 2.6.8-rc3.  I will be
adding more detailed documentation to the Documentation directory
in a separate patch.
Thoughts?
							Thanx, Paul

+/**
+ * rcu_read_lock - mark the beginning of an RCU read-side critical section.
+ *
+ * When synchronize_kernel() is invoked on one CPU while other CPUs
+ * are within RCU read-side critical sections, then the
+ * synchronize_kernel() is guaranteed to block until after all the other
+ * CPUs exit their critical sections.  Similarly, if call_rcu() is invoked
+ * on one CPU while other CPUs are within RCU read-side critical
+ * sections, invocation of the corresponding RCU callback is deferred
+ * until after the all the other CPUs exit their critical sections.
+ *
+ * Note, however, that RCU callbacks are permitted to run concurrently
+ * with RCU read-side critical sections.  One way that this can happen
+ * is via the following sequence of events: (1) CPU 0 enters an RCU
+ * read-side critical section, (2) CPU 1 invokes call_rcu() to register
+ * an RCU callback, (3) CPU 0 exits the RCU read-side critical section,
+ * (4) CPU 2 enters a RCU read-side critical section, (5) the RCU
+ * callback is invoked.  This is legal, because the RCU read-side critical
+ * section that was running concurrently with the call_rcu() (and which
+ * therefore might be referencing something that the corresponding RCU
+ * callback would free up) has completed before the corresponding
+ * RCU callback is invoked.
+ *
+ * RCU read-side critical sections may be nested.  Any deferred actions
+ * will be deferred until the outermost RCU read-side critical section
+ * completes.
+ *
+ * It is illegal to block while in an RCU read-side critical section.

+ * Of course, writers must coordinate with each other.  The normal
