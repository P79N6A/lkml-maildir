It means that systems (like Linux) that make IP addresses owned by the
host instead of specific interfaces cannot correctly interoperate with
such remote systems.
It is also the case that a host cannot possibly be aware of all
subnets present on a given LAN, therefore is should be liberal in it's
replies to ARP requests.
Finally, it violates the most basic rule of IP networking:
"Be liberal in what you accept, and conservative in what you send"
-Jon Postel
In general, when a host posses the information necessary to allow
other hosts to communicate, it should provide that information
whenever possible.
