I really didn't want to go back and forth on this (my fingers are still sore from
our convo on ltc-interlock :-)), but I might as well oblige.

Sure, by watching a directory with Inotify, you receive notification upon rename() 
events.  Now, as far as Inotify is concerned, how this is finally interpreted is up to 
the user space programs it's feeding.  In terms of audit, there must never be a
chance for subversion.  If this feature were implemented in terms of Inotify as it 
stands now, the processing we do in fs/dcache.c would need to be shifted to a
user space app which is obviously out of the question.  One alternative, the one 
I believe you're in favor of, is to augment Inotify itself.  But, AFAICT, nothing in 
Inotify's documentation leads me to believe that this adds anything to Inotify itself 
(with the exception of complication and obfuscation), especially in terms of event 
notification.  IMO, by tieing our logic to Inotify we'd inadvertently be dooming it to 
the dreaded Second-system syndrome:

I've yet to be convinced that merging these two projects or implementing 
one in terms of the other has any real benefit to either project in terms of
their individual goals and requirements.
The only real similarty between the two projects from my POV is that they 
are both interested in reporting a subset of file system activity and could 
benefit from a set of common hooks (ie: fsnotify) where it makes sense.

Where functionality is the same or similar, we can address that, but surely 
in the interim the inclusion of this patch into -mm would be beneficial to the 
98% of dissimilar functionality :)

Well I guess this boils down to what you consider an issue.  In terms of audit 
and this patch, tagging audit info to the inode ensures that it's auditable from 
any namespace.  When a location and name is audited, the administrator does 
so from what they consider a meaningful namespace and device (ie: for most, 
the path /etc/shadow is meaningful, so by "watching" it, you've made a file 
containing security secrets auditable and not your favorite LOTR ascii art) .
