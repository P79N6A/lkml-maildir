   Yes. I see. C goes in direction of C++.
   For me cast in C is always "forget original type and assume this type."
   From this standpoint it makes a lot of sense. Is just like
((stuct { char a,b,c,d;})4).a - never tryed it in gcc (3.3 does not 
accept it), but IIRC was possible on old PC C compilers - Turbo C 2/3 - 
not sure name/version, but I used it. (Yes! recalled - M$VC/winbase.h 
use this kind of macros for manipulating bytes/words/dwords/etc)
   And in old C classes it was always said that in C you can convert 
anything to everything, it just size of types must be the same.
   Why not after all?

   No Nice, But Accepted.
   I have just checked my code base - I do not use this feature in any 
way ;-)

  calculated with micrometric precisions from vague
