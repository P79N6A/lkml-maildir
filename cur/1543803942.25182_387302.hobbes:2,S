What about I said was inaccurate?  I never said that it increases 
exponentially or anything like that, just that it does increase, which 
you've proven.  I was speaking in the case of a RAID-5 set, where the 
minimum is 3 drives, so every additional drive increases the chance of a 
double fault condition.  Now if we're including mirrors and stripes/etc, 
then that means we do have to look at the 2 spindle case, but the third 
spindle and beyond keeps increasing.  If you've a 1% failure rate, and you 
have 100+ drives, chances are pretty good you're going to see a failure. 
Yes it's a LOT more complicated than that.
