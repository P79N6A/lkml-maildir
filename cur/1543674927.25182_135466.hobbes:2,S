Why can't you have a module id in the notifier chain, and use a boolean
to tell if it is set, or something similar to that?  That way you could
mix them, if the bool is set then do the try_in_module_count thing, if
not then just call the function.  It does add some components to the
register structure, but that shouldn't hurt anything besides taking a
little more memory.

You don't understand how the RCU code works.  The race is as you
describe.  If notifier_chain_unregister() removes the item from the list
and then calls synchronize_kernel(), and all the notifier calls are in
unpreemptable sections, you guarantee that no one can be left that can
call the notifier, they will all have left their preemptable sections
before synchronize_kernel() will return.  It's a little wierd, but it
does work.
If the calls to the notifier chain are outside unpreemptable sections,
though, then there's no guaranteed of when they will run (with a
preemptable kernel) so this won't work.
