	Well, clearly I'm not so familiar with the code, either; I
should have examined the code paths more thoroughly...  I'd say that
the simplest thing to do is to move the sk->dport and sk->daddr
assignments in itcp_ipv4.c up 22 lines, between the sk->rcv_saddr
assignment and the if (!sk->num) {.
	I don't see inet_stream_connect() calling inet_autobind() in
linux-2.3.15/net/ipve/af_inet.c.  However, inet_dgram_connect(),
inet_recvmsg(), and inet_sendmsg() all call inet_autobind(), and these
call sites also need review and possible change.
