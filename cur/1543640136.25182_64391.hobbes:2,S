See this:
	process X
	fork()			
			------->	Process Y
					clone()
								----> thread Z
					exit()
					THIS MUST NOT
					WRITE TO MEMORY
					IN Z!!
Notice how the exit() in Y will never be able to write into the address 
space of X - it would only write into the address space of Z, and Z is not 
expecting that at all!
