Why are their lifetimes different? Usually, if I hold on to the device,
I also want to be able to use the structure that embeds the device.

They must do this in the ->remove callback.

device_create() would need to not expect a class then, or it's not
universally usable. Also, the driver would need a method to get back
from the device to my_device. We're practically back at the first
option again, only that now the ->release function is sitting in the
driver core instead of the subsystem.

Discoupling of sysfs and kobject lifetime rules definetly eliminates a
lot of issues.
