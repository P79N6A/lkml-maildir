Hi,
Over the past week, I've posted various messages to Linux kernel about
various NFS and sound problems on 2.3.99, some of them have turned out
to be bugs in the ARM code, but there is one in particular which has
been difficult to find.
This problem is where I play mp3s on a machine, and the mp3s are stored
remotely.
By adding various debugs and so forth to the kernel, I think I've found
the culprit: kswapd.
kswapd appears to take a long time to complete its task regularly (200ms+
on occasion).  Here is the messages that indicate this:
0000e943: RPC: 2426 removed from queue c103a048 "xprt_pending"
0000e943: RPC: 2426 added to queue c01ad5d4 "schedq"
0000e943: need_resched = 1, comm = mxaudio
0000e943: RPC:      __rpc_wake_up done
kswapd: awake at 59715
0000e943: RPC: 2427 __rpc_wake_up (now 59715 inh 0)

Sometimes it takes around 10ms to do its job, other times it can be as high
as 400ms.  Obviously this is not good for interactive performance, let alone
using anything like sound under Linux.
I'm not sure if this is an ARM specific problem, but I wouldn't have thought
so.  It may be related to the problem where the cached data takes over all
the memory, but I'm not sure.
/proc/meminfo indicates:
        total:    used:    free:  shared: buffers:  cached:
Mem:  30887936 30339072   548864        0    86016 20320256
Swap: 66056192        0 66056192
