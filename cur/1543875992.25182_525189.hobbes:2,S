People get frustrated that it doesn't work then start doing stupid
things like sending it to the actual list, like this person did.
Of course they always fail to consider doing the proper thing which is
to ask postmaster@vger.kernel.org or the list owner
(linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org in this case) for help if it is
the case that their email has changed and they no longer have a way to
send from the subscribed address.

To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in
the body of a message to majordomo@vger.kernel.org
