no, even if latency was smaller, the CPU simply does not overlap inb/outb
with preceding/succeeding instructions. even worse, it 'syncs' the
pipeline basically, so by moving instructions _between_ IO instructions
you increase latency. (because we lose the integration effect otherwise
that instruction could get)

this is not necessarily robust. Timekeeping so far was pretty much
independent of the cycle counter. (micro-time is not, but generic
timekeeping yes). Now with your patch if the cycle counter produces
something funny, we'd not only get a message, but also broken time.
i think Andrea you are losing the generic picture. 10 msecs is _alot_ of
time, especially on systems that have a time stamp counter. We should
_not_ block interrupts for more than 10 msecs. If we do then yes we've
lost a few ticks (we've lost them in previous Linux versions too, so this
is certainly nothing new), but now we also get a message so people can fix
it. You've just increased complexity in an already complex and hard to
maintain piece of code to 'fix' the symptom of a fundamentally broken and
rare case, instead of just detecting and fixing the real reason.
