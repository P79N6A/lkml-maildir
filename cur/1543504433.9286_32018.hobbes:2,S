Hmm.. I ran 2.2.10ac10 for just under two days before my SCSI drive was
corrupted. Unfortunately it happened a couple of days before I was due to
leave the company I was working for, so didnt have time to grab anything
of use from it. The controller was an Adaptec AIC-7871 (IIRC), drive was
from the same batch as this one:
Vendor: IBM       Model: DCAS-32160W       Rev: S65A
Type:   Direct-Access                      ANSI SCSI revision: 02
I did manage to salvage a kern.log, but the last entry was the drive being
remounted as readonly (obviously) after an error. Will see if I can find
the log again. The new kernel wasnt configured any differently from the
2.2.3 kernel which was on there since it was released.
