API is API, if in-kernel, in-X-lib, or in-userland-VFS-lib is completely
irrelevant.

It's your only option... or get them together and define a common
framework.
But then again, what would I want to do with metadata in bash? If needed,
it is probably much easier to write tools to extract whatever is needed, no
reason to futz around with the shell. That simple idea was the single most
important advance Unix introduced: The shell is a /simple/ program, it
doesn't do word processing and coffee brewing for you. That is handled by
other programs, one for each task.

Or just keep only their own obscure userspace system, no need to have to
mess with our own format and a kernel system.

Again: API is API. If in kernel or in a standard library makes no
difference. Libary is /much/ easier to develop, and hugely more
flexible. It is for a reason that printf(3) and qsort(3) are /not/
in-kernel.

So the metadata facility in kernel won't be used, for portability's sake.
