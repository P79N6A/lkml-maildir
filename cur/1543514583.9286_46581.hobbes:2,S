Only when the kernel code in question does interruptible sleeps.  This
seems not to be true in your case and the code deadlocked somewhere. 
You apparantly encountered a kernel bug.
Try again with a more informative bug report (which processes are
unkillable, in which function do they sleep ('ps axl', WCHAN field)). 
The usual stuff.

You can avoid the fsck when you remount the filesystem read-only.  You
can do this either with 'mount yourfs -o remount,ro' or 'umount -a -r'.
