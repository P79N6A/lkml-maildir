Hey there,
I have a bunch of web servers all running RedHat 6.0 that use 2.2.10-13 
kernels.  The servers are a collection of PPro,  PII, and PIII's with 
different motherboards, scsi, network and video cards.  Since moving to 
2.2.x kernels, these servers have not been very stable under load.  Back 
with 2.0.x kernels, I would have 90+ days of uptime.
But after doing fresh installs of Redhat 6.0 and rebuilding the kernels, I 
only get uptimes of a week or less before the different boxes lock up 
solid.  When one locks up, I don't see any Oops or kernel panics or 
anything else that might give a hint as to what happended.
About the only thing common between all of these servers is that they all 
run serial consoles with this line in lilo.conf
   append="console=tty0 console=ttyS1,19200n8"
Now I haven't tested this extensively yet, but it appears that when I 
reverse the ordering or drop the serial consoles, the servers appear to be 
more stable.
Is this just a coincident or could there be a problem somewhere in the 
kernel that would cause the system to be less stable when a serial console 
is used as the default for /dev/console?   Or am I just missing something 
else more obvious?  I ran memtest on everything and they all come back 
error free, also all these boxes ran 2.0.x kernels without problems.
I'm just not sure what else to try, any suggestions?
David
