A bad change for several reasons.
(i) more object code is generated
(ii) the code is slower
(iii) you change something
Straight line code is cheap, jumps are expensive.
Replacing an assignment by a jump is not an improvement.
But far worse: this is a purposeless microoptimization.
At least one out of every hundred trivial patches is broken.
Thus, a stream of trivial changes will only break the kernel, for no gain.
