Uhm, it already is multithreaded.  Kind Of.  That is how a monolithic
kernel ends up working -- the exported floppy interface is threaded to
each running process that uses it.  So each user space thread runs the
the kernel code in its context and you get a result of the floppy driver
being multithreaded.
Then you have the backend...the block and VM layers that obviously
aren't all in the context of a user space application.  The system will
scale fine to your one floppy drive and multiple CPUs.
