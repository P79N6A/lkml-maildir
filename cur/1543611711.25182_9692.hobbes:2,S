I verified your problem using 2.4.16 (with gdb-20010813(MI_OUT)) and 
2.2.15pre18 (with gdb-4.18).  Thinking about it, I remembered that in the 
past there have been some problems with newer versions of gdb with threaded 
programs.  So, I tried using gdb-4.18 on 2.4.16 and it worked fine.
Methinks that this looks like a gdb issue.
As further testing I added a couple of statements after the strtod() call:
         printf( "%f\n", d);
         return;
If I step through the program, I see the nan value displayed by gdb and 
also printed by printf().  If I put a breakpoint at the printf() and run 
the program, the proper value is printed out.  This looks a whole lot like 
gdb is having a problem when stepping over the strtod() call.
I will forward a copy of this message to the gdb mailing list.
