I currently believe we can do it without TestSetPageLocked in
do_wp_page(): just with a few memory barriers added.  But that
belief may evaporate once I actually focus on each site: it
wouldn't be the first time I've fooled myself like that, so
please keep on the alert, Nick.

Hmm, an actual lock_page, that wasn't what I was intending.
Would be simple, I'm trying to remember why I ruled it out earlier.
Oh, yes, we're holding the pte lock there, that's why.

Well, yes, we wouldn't have all these problems if we didn't have
to respect COW.  But generally a process can, one way or another,
make sure it won't get into those problems: Yingchao is concerned
with the way the TestSetPageLocked unpredictably upsets correctness.
I'd say it's a more serious error than the general problems with COW.

Most processes won't fork, and exec has freed them from sharing
their parents pages, and their private file mappings aren't being
used as buffers.  Maybe Yingchao will later have to worry about
those cases, but for now it seems not.

(madvise MADV_DONTFORK)
For the longest time I couldn't understand you there at all, perhaps
distracted by your parenthetical line: at last I think you're proposing
we tweak mprotect to behave differently on a VM_DONTCOPY area.
But differently in what way?  Allow it to ignore Copy-On-Write?
No, of course not.  Go down to the struct page level (one of the
nice things about mprotect is that it doesn't need to look at struct
pages at present, except perhaps inside the ia64 lazy_mmu_prot_update),
and decide if it has to do the copying itself instead?  Doesn't sound
a good place to do it; and would involve just the same problematic
TestSetPageLocked within pte lock that do_wp_page is doing,
so wouldn't solve anything.
Or I'm still misunderstanding you.
