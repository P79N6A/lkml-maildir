Subject: [PATCH] fix madvise vma merging
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Better late than never, I've at last reviewed the madvise vma merging
going into 2.6.13.  Remove a pointless check and fix two little bugs -
a simple test (with /proc/<pid>/maps hacked to show ReadHints) showed
both mismerges in practice: though being madvise, neither was disastrous.
1. Correct placement of the success label in madvise_behavior: as in
   mprotect_fixup and mlock_fixup, it is necessary to update vm_flags
   when vma_merge succeeds (to handle the exceptional Case 8 noted in
   the comments above vma_merge itself).
2. Correct initial value of prev when starting part way into a vma: as
   in sys_mprotect and do_mlock, it needs to be set to vma in this case
   (vma_merge handles only that minimum of cases shown in its comments).
3. If find_vma_prev sets prev, then the vma it returns is prev->vm_next,
   so it's pointless to make that same assignment again in sys_madvise.
