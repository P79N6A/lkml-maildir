Of course, this is what I meant.

It probably still is, but not every *user* that might want to compile a
kernel himself has the ncurses development files installed. Instead of
installing those he might as well install python (which most normal
users can use probably a lot better since the kernel wouldn't be the
only thing depending on it)...

I have to admit that I don't really know anything about CML at all (so
my points might be wrong), but I personally would favour a nice
replacement of 'make menuconfig' written in python.
