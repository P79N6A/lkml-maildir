This is a more complex scenario, It sounds like B/C and D should be
hard limited to 2G or another value, depending on how much you want to
pre-reserve for A (all B/C and D should be in the same cgroup). Then
you want to use soft limits within the B/C/D cgroup. You don't want to
hard limit A, but just setup a 2G soft limit for it.
The notion of prioritized jobs and reservation does not exist yet, but
once we support soft limits and overcommit via soft limits, we could
consider looking at what design aspects would help with it.
