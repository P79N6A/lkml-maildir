Subject: [PATCH] Fix 32/64-bit bug in ext3
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The following patch fixes a 32/64-bit bug in ext3.  We assign the number
of bytes written to an int instead of a ssize_t, which causes the top
32-bits of the return value from write() to be lopped off.  Please
apply to 2.6.0-test tree.  Thanks!!
