With respect to the ix86:
The current HZ value of 100 is definitely archaic, best suitable for a
386SX at 16MHz. The performance potential of increasing HZ with respect to
realtime and interactivite responsiveness is so huge, it simply cannot be
overlooked. 
I have a patch for the user RTC upper limit, making it somewhat
proportional to BogoMips. This is of course pretty vague, but works well
enough in practice. Perhaps a similar method could be used for HZ? A
selection based on processor type would also work, I guess (something along
100 for i386, 256 for i486, 512 for i586, 1024 for i686). 
How difficult is it to fix the uptime wraparound issue by use of a long 
long?
