Indeed there does seem to be new firmware out as of 2/23/05. I ran my 
tests with the 9/10/04 firmware but I did not adjust the CARM_MAX_Q 
value. Do either of you happen to know what firmware revisions you 
tested under?
I've put the machine with the SX8 controller into production despite the 
performance issues so I'm not going to be of any use for testing 
revisions to the driver :(
