It was renamed to ioremap and moved to arch/<arch>/mm/ioremap.c .
But this part of the patch looks bad to me anyway; it stops anyone from
mapping part of the hole to VM, but presumably anything that does this
knows what it's doing (probably a driver mapping memory straight from an
ISA card).  Or am I missing something?

Doesn't look worth saving, as Stephen Early's patch looks more flexible
(not to mention supporting far more machines).
