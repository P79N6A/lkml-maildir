Subject: Reproducible 2.6.11.9 NFS Kernel Crashing Bug!
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

When I run the following command over NFS:
dd if=/dev/hde of=/remote/disk5/file.img bs=1M
After > 30-60 seconds, it kills the remote machine.
I cannot ping the machine, nor can I wake up the monitor to see what 
happened.
The mount options I am using are:
rw,hard,intr,rsize=65536,wsize=65536,nfsvers=3 0 0
1] /dev/hde is on a promise controller on an abit-ic7-g
2] /remote/disk5 is on a promise controller on another abit-ic7-g
Both filesystems are XFS.
The network interface is 1000mbpx full duplex.
Log of what happens, the packet loss begins when the dd starts moving the 
bits over to the other box.
# The following is right before I ran the dd command.

Oh, and incase one may think there is a network issue, there is not, 
during normal operation when I am not running dd, there are no network 
problems, as shown below.
