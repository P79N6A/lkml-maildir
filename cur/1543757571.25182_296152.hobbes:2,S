If you added this, you've done much more than just adding it.  Look 
two lines above and realise that you've just changed what the "else"
clause conditionalises.

So, with your printk in place, we try pci_bus_alloc_resource.  If that
succeeds or fails, we completely stomp on that with allocate_resource.
Bad.  Very bad.
The first thing that needs solving is why you're getting the "odd IO
request" crap.  That may explain why the resource can't be allocated.
