Well, /proc/stat, and kstat_cpu is very inaccurate. There's a project going
on to get better statistics for usage by cpufreq governors. And you really
don't want to export all sorts of statistics every, or every tenth timer 
tick to userspace. But if it's done in kernel-space, and if it's done right,
it may cost really few percentage points of performance.
Even though the governor proposed by Venkatesh may be done as well in
userspace [which I doubt], it's only one of several possible dynamic 
cpufreq governors, most of which will be much faster, leaner and meaner in
kernel space.
