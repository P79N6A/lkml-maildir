There are a few places in the Makefile where options would need to be
entered.  This just brings those places together in a clean manner and
allows for one to set the flags via the configuration interface.
Though it would be excellent if the kernel had more gcc
micro-optimization (facilitated by such features as the upcoming gcc
4.3's -finstrument-functions-exclude-function-list option), general
CFLAGS used for the entire kernel do not impact the safety of the
kernel build, assuming that the options are sane.  It would be
interesting, however, to see an initiative to tune gcc flags for
important functions and  sections within the kernel for optimal
performance given some sort of envisioned usage.  (*hint, kernel devs,
hint*)

Sorry about that.  I didn't mean to portray it as "shouting" so much
as a very visible and stern warning.

Something else that could be included is a link to the manual for the
(currently used) gcc's command flags
(
http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.2.3/gcc/index.html#toc_Invoking-GCC
)
or at least to the online docs, considering that specifying one
specific gcc version's manual would yield various issues.

I feel that perhaps it is a bit silly to put in such description, as
one using the flags should only do so in knowing specifically which
ones they wish to use and why ahead of time.  However, it cannot hurt
to put in more help documentation, so it's a fine suggestion.

Can anyone tell me if the implementation I chose looks alright?  The
kernel has an, understandably, large, complex, and tad messy
buildsystem, so it is troublesome to discover whether all the
appropriate codepaths are being hit that involve using these flags.
