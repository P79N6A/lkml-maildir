Some other poor bastard can sign their NDA's to write their drivers.

Right, I count the number of fingers I have before and after I shake hands
with the folks in their camp.  If I get an extra, I feel sorry for the
poor bastard who was there before me.
I still have 4 fingers and 1 thumb on each hand, and I plan to keep it
that way.
