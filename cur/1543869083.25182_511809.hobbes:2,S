I think we can merge krealloc without unionfs. I'll whoop up a new patch 
as per Christoph's suggestions. I think at least XFS already has its own 
realloc and there might be some other open-coded users. It's not 
_changing_ the slab as much as adding new functionality that makes sense 
fron a general point of view.
The ksize exports we can add later if unionfs is to be merged.
