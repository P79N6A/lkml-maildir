	If CVS is the "preferred form", then it is CVS you must distribute. 
What other tools provide what other information is irrelevant. The 
GPL is quite clear that the preferred form of the source for making 
modifications is what you must distribute.

	The GPL doesn't care about whether you're better off or worse off. 
The GPL just says you have to distribute the source in its preferred 
form for making modifications.

	It sounds like you and I are in violent agreement. But it's not 
purely hypothetical -- there are GPL projects today that keep their 
source in proprietary file formats. (For example, many of the ones 
using Visual C++.)
