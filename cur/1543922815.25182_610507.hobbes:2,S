I am.  Taking every single reference to a page into account simply
won't scale to systems with 1TB of RAM.  This is why I am working
on implementing:
http://linux-mm.org/PageReplacementDesign
At the moment I only have the basic "plumbing" of the split VM
working and am fixing some bugs in that.  Expect a patch series
with that soon, so you guys can review that code and tell me
where to beat it into shape some more :)
After that I will work on the policy bits, where we can really
get performance benefits.  The patch series should be mergeable
in smaller increments, so we can take things slowly if desired.
