Sometimes writing 512 bytes is not a big problem.  If 99% of the writes
are large, everything will be fine.  But with a 32x increase from 512
byte writes, those really should be rare.

That is correct.  Noticing this will take a while, though.  Even the
worst chips sold today seem to have a manufacturer guarantee of 10.000
erases per block.  Across a 16MB area, that means you have to write
160GB of data to that one area before you enter the danger zone.
Significantly less with static data around, but still a lot.
And even when that happens, the chips doesn't suddenly explode on the
10.001st erase.  Your chances of getting correctable or uncorrectable
errors will increase, though.
For the majority of use cases, such a behaviour is good enough.  It
beats floppies hands down.  You will never wear them out with your
digital camera or mp3 player.  Using it instead of a hard disk in your
notebook may be a little risky, though.

It doesn't matter much what I mean.  The question is how the
manufacturer of your device interpreted it.  Most likely ext2 will work
just fine within the limitations I've outlined.
What changes is the failure mode.  Floppies died from storing them in a
dark and cool place.  Some were sold brand-new and dead.  Disks die from
random, mostly mechanical, failures at a rate of 7% per years in a
Google setup.  Flash usually dies from writing to it, the more you write
the faster it dies.
So as long as you rarely write, pick any filesystem you like.  The
choice only matters when you write a lot.

Wear leveling across the whole device, not just one area.

No worries!
