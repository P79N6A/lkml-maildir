Cc linux-kernel on 3 patches "specific to some subsystem" that add the 
word "select" to Kconfig files and I'll catch at least one bug before it 
enters your tree...

It should be enough to trust maintainers that they follow the rules.
And in the unlikely case someone didn't follow them you know whom you 
have to watch closely during his next merge requests...

There's a middle way.
Requiring the submission of bigger changes and new drivers to be Cc'ed 
to linux-kernel can help and shouldn't cause real problems.
And requiring this kind of patches to be in linux-next for some time
should also be possible.
Both can improve the quality of the kernel.
Trivial patches and bugfixes might not have to follow these rules, but 
that's similar to e.g. the current merge window process also having 
exceptions for new drivers.
