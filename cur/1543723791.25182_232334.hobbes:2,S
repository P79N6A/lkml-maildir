My own project is a block driver, that's not a filesystem, right?  
Cluster membership services as implemented by Sistina are generic, 
symmetric and (hopefully) raceless.  See:
  
http://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/als00/2000papers/papers/full_papers/preslan/preslan.pdf
There is much overlap between the OpenAIS and Sistina's Symmetric 
Cluster Architecture.  You are right, we do need to get together.
By the way, how do I get your source code if I don't agree with the 
BitKeeper license?
Regards,
Daniel
