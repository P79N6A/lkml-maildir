If you've already got a filesystem, may I recommend you drop cramfs,
and use jffs over readonly compressed loopback?  That way you don't
need the cramfs code (or its in-built limitations), and you get much
better compression (in fact, despite its cuteness, I believe cramfs is
the wrong solution for everything).  I hacked together a compressed
loopback one afternoon for the Linuxcare Bootable Business Card: I
think the source is on the LC site somewhere.
Several people have fixed bugs in that version of cloop.c, and I'm
told that it dies badly on SMP; I don't like the block layer at all,
so I'm not surprised, but someone like Ted can probably fix this with
a glance...
Cheers,
Rusty.
PS. EMail me and I'll forward you the accumulated (untested) fixes...
