Arguments to what?  The path for sending the NMI_VECTOR is
send_IPI_allbutself -> {cluster,flat,physflat}_send_IPI_allbutself ->
{__send_IPI_shortcut, physflat_send_IPI_mask, cluster_send_IPI_mask} ->
send_IPI_mask_sequence -> __prepare_ICR.
Pushing the check for NMI_VECTOR any higher than __prepare_ICR needs
multiple tests for NMI_VECTOR.
