This is probably a naive question but I haven't found the solution through
normal docs.
Where can I find explanations of the kernel bootup options passed on the
command line?
I am loading a new system with Slackware 7.0 and get a kernel panic at
boot time which complains about a missing init and suggests setting an
init= option for the kernel.  These are new complaints (to me) and I can't
find any reference to the kernel parameters.  Thanks for your patience.
