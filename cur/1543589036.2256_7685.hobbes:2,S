what work around what? right now it's the kernel who thinks that root
is special, and applications work around that because there's a
division of super-user and plain user. is that a must?
it's trivial to say that in multi-user system, one user shall not mess
with other user. in multi-process, a process shall not mess with other
process.
but when it comes to a computer which only has one user, why would
it stop a user. because the kernel thinks it isn't right? if he
felt like killing random process, which is owned by other than the
user, is it a wrong thing to do? he owns the computer, he may do
anything he wants.
and i'm not even trying to convince anyone. communicating is
closer.

i wrote somewhere that it was my mistake to call it single-user when i
mean all user has the same root cap, and reduce "user" (account) to
"profile".
