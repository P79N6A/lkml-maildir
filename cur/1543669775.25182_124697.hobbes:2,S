On a hyper-threaded CPU, it seems to me that there could be a lot of
cache-thrashing if the two processes running are completely unrelated.  On
the other hand, if one process has two threads, then they would benefit (or
hurt less) from the cache-sharing, because they share the same memory space.
Does the HT-aware scheduler attempt to take this into account by scheduling
two related threads to run simultaneously on the same CPU as often as
possible (unless you're in a multi-processor system and another CPU would
otherwise be idle)?
