  Sorry, no you didn't. What you didn't say was if this was a bug fix or
speedup or ??? Not trying to devalue your comment, but non-fp system are
usually embedded and do so little fp that any speedup would not matter,
while result errors matter and actual crashes would be high priority. The
line is long enough for specifying stuff like that, and gives a quick read
on the relevance of a patch. If would be useful to narrow "fix" a bit, and
I think that's what the O.P. was asking.

I'll suggest that "signal handling, ptrace, int disable and IP cksum" 
would fit and give a general feel for what was being addressed. That's the
flavor of what would be more useful to me, and I wouldn't mind having the
whole paragraph if that's what it takes, I read text faster than code;-) 
Like having a NIC driver "multicast icmp packet loss" is more
informational than "obscure corner case fix."
