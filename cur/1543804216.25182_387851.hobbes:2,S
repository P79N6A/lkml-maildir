The problem -- 30 seconds for each disk IO operation, followed by
syslog messages such as:
  ata1: slow completion (cmd ef)
  ata2: slow completion (cmd ef)
  ata1: command 0x25 timeout, stat 0x50 host_stat 24
  ata2: command 0x25 timeout, stat 0x50 host_stat 24
The cause -- the ASUS A7V-E with the sata_via driver does not
receive interupts without ACPI enabled (yet another Via IRQ quirk,
or incomplete handing or the currently known quirks?).  Once ACPI
is enabled, the SATA works perfectly, on both a A7V-E SE and a
A7V-E Deluxe.
These VT8237R based boards use a VT6420 Serial ATA chip
(attention

 maintainer!).
The next problems seem to be 64-bit regions being used for the
ethernet (SKGE) and Nvida 7800GTX on a 32-bit kernel causing
the drivers for these devices to refuse to load.
David.
