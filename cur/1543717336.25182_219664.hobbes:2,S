It would not be helpful to take a userspace request to perform a file
(or directory) copy operation and break it into open/sendfile/close by
passing file handles to the network filesystem and have this work for
SMB/CIFS - there is no equivalent network protocol operation.  It also
makes the operation much, much harder to make atomic (since two systems
are involved) and makes error handling and recovery for network
filesystems much harder since inconsistent client and server state have
to be considered if the copy operation is broken into pieces on the
clien (it is also slower - a single copy operation on the network is the
absolute optimal case - minimizes the expensive network latency - the
roundtrip delay - open/sendfile/close sends at a minimum three times as
many but likely four with an extra lookup or two)
Currently copy file (or copy directory for that matter) as both speced
(and is implemented in various servers) in the SMB/CIFS network
filesystem protocol takes in effect four parameters (there is no handle
based file copy):
a source pathname,  and source export (actually SMB tree identifier for
a share, but in effect the same thing) 
a target pathname, and target export (actually SMB tree identifier for a
share, but in effect the same thing) 
And the shares (exports) referenced have to be on the same server
Trying to ignore the 1st file open
