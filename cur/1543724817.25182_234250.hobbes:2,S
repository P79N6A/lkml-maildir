Though most of the current cond_resched invocations in mainline (and the
future ones too) should be optimized away with preempt enabled, so maybe
it's simpler to just implement a cond_resched_force() that isn't
optimized away with preempt enabled and use it in lock_kernel? I'm
missing where cond_resched is needed inside lock_kernel though,
preempt_schedule already checks TIF_NEED_RESCHED by hand (on the top of
my mind I don't recall cond_rescheds that shouldn't be optimized away
with preempt enabled).

I also had instability with it and I've seen debug checks in ext3 too
(but it's not finished anyways), and I've still a bit of printk flooding
so I'm uncertain if it's my mistake due the more strict debugging I
added in schedule() or an issue in the newer cond_resched but thanks for
the info (sounds like not all the debug checks triggering are my mistake ;).
