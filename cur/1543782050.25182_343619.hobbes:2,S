Laughter was not wholly unexpected, though I wasn't joking.  I'm trying
to be realistic about the lifetime of any given hardware, and IOC4 is
several years old at this point.  Couple that with a sincere desire to
preserve application source compatability when (not if) new hardware
appears, and an abstraction layer seemed to be a logical choice.  I'm
more than happy to discuss problems in the abstraction layer's interface
and make appropriate changes -- I'm nothing if not obliging.
I do recognize that the code is a bit excessive given that there's
only one known device (IOC4) that is currently supported.  However,
the abstraction isn't really all that complicated.  The low-level
driver simply provides to the abstraction layer a structure containing
a handful of functions pointers: get/set output modes and timings,
get/set interrupt sources, get timing roundoff information and device
ID.  The abstraction layer provides a function to call whenever an
interrupt occurs.  Then add in a bit of registration/deregistration
glue so that kernel modules can load and unload.  That's pretty much it
-- nothing fancier than needed to decouple hardware implementation details
from the programming interface.
Yes, I suppose I could implement completely seperate hardware drivers
with a consistent interface, and do away with the abstraction layer.
However, that leads to code duplication, which has its own downfalls.
Personally, if I had to pick one poison or the other I'd take
overengineering over maintaining divergent implementations, but the
patch apparently made my predeliction obvious :).
Thanks,
