It's not broken, it's just not included yet.
There is a patch somewhere out there, which could fix your issue.
Just to give it a name, it's something like:
linux-2.6-sata-promise-pata-ports.patch
I patched a 2.6.18.1 and didn't run into any troubles with it with
lots of i/o. So, i take it as "works for me". But Jeff knows when it's
the right time to push that. :-)
Greets,
Clemens Koller
