Subject: Making thread time visible to `ps`

Hello,
This is the kernel thread in a module. It gets awakened
to do some work as a result of an interrupt. It does
the right thing and works.
But.... `ps` never shows it using ANY cpu time!  I know
that the procedure, read_fifo() takes about 600,000 cpu
clocks, measured with rdtsc, so I would expect that
that time would be visible. Does anybody know how to
make the time that a kernel thread uses, become visible
to `ps` ???
static int32_t local_thread(void *unused)
{
     DAEMONIZE;                                  // In config.h
     SET_PRIORITY(-19);                          // In config.h
     memcpy(current->comm, task_name, sizeof(task_name));
     set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE);
     schedule_timeout(0);                        // Let insmod complete
     __asm__ __volatile__("thread:\n.global thread\n");
     for(;;)
     {
         set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE);
         if(signal_pending(current))
             complete_and_exit(&info->quit, 0);
         interruptible_sleep_on(&info->twait);
         set_current_state(TASK_RUNNING);
         read_fifo();
     }
     return 0;	// Just quiet the compiler
}
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
