This is bugged. e.g. the following line will hit this exception check:
	int i = some_function(a, b, c);

This is a royal pain, since it now throws an ERROR for the obviously preferable 
piece of code below:
if (err) {
	do_something();
	return -ERR;
} else {
	do_somthing_else();
}
Also, CondingStyle explicitly permits this style (even encourages it):
---
Do not unnecessarily use braces where a single statement will do.
if (condition)
	action();
This does not apply if one branch of a conditional statement is a single
statement. Use braces in both branches.
if (condition) {
	do_this();
	do_that();
} else {
	otherwise();
}
---
So, IMO this test needs to go, unless the script becomes smart enough to know 
that either side of the else requires braces. It's definately not an ERROR.
