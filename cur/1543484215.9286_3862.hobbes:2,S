This addressed to the kernel developers who dropped the attempt to merge
message queue improvements to 2.2 because it was causing compatibility 
complexities ?
I think everyone tries to avoid stuff like that. Internal to kernel stability
is very hard to do. External API's should _never_ need to become incompatible,
at worst they will bite incorrectly coded programs tht perhaps assume a
reserved field will end up zero.

Actually the RH tree had all the security holes fixed. I never had good
experience with 5.3+linxuthreads and since this code ticks over nicely in
glibc Im inclined to assume 5.3 had bugs there.
