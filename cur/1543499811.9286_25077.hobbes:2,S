Hello all, hello Linus,
I watched that thread with great interrest and now I have to add something
to it. I have two systems: One is an AMD K6-2 350 MHz the other is a new
dual Pentium III 450 Mhz. By the time I installed the dual cpu system I
upgraded my kernel to 2.2.9 and saw the same file corruption.
Then I changed my RAM timings to lower values and everything worked. I
thought it was a RAM issue, but today I took the time and installed my new
RAM's from the dual system into the AMD system and they are working without
problems at high settings.
File corruption occurs when I untar two linux-tarballs and do a diff between
the two. I can see random bit flipping and and excahnged lines of source.
Theese corruptions also happen when I use an UP kernel on the dual cpu machine
and do _not_ happen on the AMD system. I disagree that it's hardware-related,
because both systems are running at 100 Mhz bus speed and were both under
heavy load during these tests.
I think it's a hard-to-trigger timing issue in the kernel, because using 2.2.6
on the dual machine at high ram timings do not show corruptions.
cheers,
Patrick
PS: Sorry this mail sounds confused, but I'm willing to do any tests you want
    on both machines.
