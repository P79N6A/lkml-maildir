You can't.  There is no LSM for userspace; LSM specifically disavowed
any common userspace API, and that was one of our original
objections/concerns about it.

Nope, they would all have their own libraries, if they have a library at
all.  But that isn't your problem - your kernel interface should be
generic, and your LSM hooks should be generic, but your userspace isn't
required to be.  Have a look at how many programs in the distribution
currently link against libselinux, whether directly or by dlopen'ing it.

Karl isn't a maintainer of the SELinux kernel code.  And I had thought
that even he had reconsidered this idea after further discussion.

Well, you could do that, if that meets your needs, but it doesn't sound
very optimal either.  Why are you opposed to having userspace determine
the context and write it to a cachefiles interface, and just have the
kernel authorize it (invoke a hook to check permissions between the
daemon's context and the specified label), and make it the acting
context when appropriate (invoke a different hook to set it as the
acting context)?
