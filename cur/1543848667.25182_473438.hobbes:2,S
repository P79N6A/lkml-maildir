That's not quite true.  You could acquire dev->parent->sem always, just to
be certain.  However USB shouldn't use this form of multithreaded probing
in any case; it should instead use multiple threads for khubd.

It's a peculiarity of the way USB works that some commands (Set
Configuration and port reset) affect the entire device, even though they
may be needed only by a driver for a single interface.  Some interface
drivers do need to issue these commands when they are probed.  The only
safe way to do it is to insure that their probe routines are called with
both the device and the interface semaphores held.

Because driver_probe_device() checks device_is_registered(dev) before 
doing anything else.

How so?  We shouldn't call bus->remove if a driver isn't bound.
Some other things were left out of the patch.  Since we can no longer know 
whether any drivers will get bound at all, device_attach() should now 
return void.  This means that bus_attach_device() can be simplified and 
should also return void.
