Hi!
I was testing 2.4.27-rc3 to see if the IDE fixes had fixed a problem I'm
suffering with a 200MB old HD, and instead of finding that fixed, I found
the kernel shouting this:
RTNL: assertion failed at br_ioctl.c(244)
This message is shown aproximately since the bridge is bringed up and till
it starts forwarding.
I don't know what other info to provide, this bridge interface right now has
just one card added to it, the machine is a pentium 133.
If you feel that any other info or any testing may be needed don't hesitate
to ask.
Regards...
