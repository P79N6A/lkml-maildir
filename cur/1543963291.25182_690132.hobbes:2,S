Hm, in my opinion seq_write() would fit more into the already existing
naming scheme of seq_file interface functions. The beauty of the idea
behind seq_file is that a user can just pretend to write to the buffer
that is read by a userspace application without having to worry about
full buffers, partial reads or seeks. In this context, the read becomes
a write and function names such as seq_printf(), seq_putc(), seq_puts()
or the suggested seq_write() seem to best fit this idea.
