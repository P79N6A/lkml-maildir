I can reproduce it with 2.4.5, 6, 13-ac7, 18-pre3 with and without Trond's
NFS-ALL patches applied. I don't understand your question, but testing this
implied several reboots of the server and some dozen reboots on the client.
The lm_sensors build reproduced it pretty stable (with a few exceptions,
and on different commands of the range ar, gcc and ln)
Test is pretty simple: clean make of lm_sensors almost all the time 
triggers it. If not, just rm lib/libsensors* and make again. This
created certainly stale files lib/libsensors.so|lib/libsensors.so.1
from within the client. You can only get rid of them by rebooting or
removing them on the server.

Please, try to reproduce it, and let us know, if you can reproduce it.
