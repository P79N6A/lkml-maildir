Also another way of doing this is having every network ask the kernel
for its key, and checking it. If it doesn't match a certified key,
then not allowing you to access the network.
Besides the fact that this would be a very costly approach, having
every network needing to update their certified keys list every time
TiVo and every other DVR vendor updates their kernels, it would also
prevent any form of modified software to give you any of the TiVo's
expected functionality: it would load, you would be able to play pong
on it, but not watch or record TV, and they can't be blamed for it,
because if the kernel's been tampered with, it might have been made so
it saves the video unencrypted on the Harddrive, and it certainly *is*
the network's right to stop you from doing so. So what the fuck do you
want from them?
