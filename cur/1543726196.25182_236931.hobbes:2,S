Right, this is definitely more obvious now.  I think I can pretty much
remove the comments now that the element names make sense.

Converted to what/how?  I am confused by your question.

It is freed in hvcs_free_partner_info() because the partner info that is
allocated needs to have scope outside of the hvcs_get_partner_info()
call.

I'll make future patches against 2.6.8-rc2.

Randy, here's an explanation given by Hollis Blanchard and Paul
Mackerras that I'll add to the code as a comment.
The hcall interface involves putting 8 chars into each of two registers.
We load up those 2 registers (in arch/ppc64/hvconsole.c) by casting
char[16] to long[2].  It would work without __ALIGNED__, but a little
(tiny) bit slower because an unaligned load is slower than aligned load.
I took care of all the other formatting things you pointed out.
Thanks for the suggestions Randy.  Hopefully I'll have a patch out this
afternoon encompassing your suggestions.
