Ah, sorry.  I was meaning the Microsoft kind of switching is stupid. 
You have tech reasons, great do them.  Mr. McVoy, sorry about my blanket
statement.  You obviously weren't just acting the way I thought you
were.

Now that is a fantastic idea, kind of like cvs meets bugzilla in one
product.  I hope you are able to do it.
Anyway, please, everyone either take it private with me, or leave me out
of it.  At this point everyone knows how I feel about the issue and why
I do.  All of these arguments only seem to reinforce those feelings and
thoughts.
RMS thank you for the good you do.  Linus and all, thank you VERY much
for all the good you do.  Larry, thank you for your kind response.
Good day to you all.
Trever
