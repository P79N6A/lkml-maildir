Joseph,
we cannot reproduce the BUG you report. We have identified a potential 
source (spinlock around mutex_init). I have attached a small patch that 
removes this lock from the initialization of the hash table. I have 
tested the patch but I cannot verify if this resolves the problem you 
are seeing.
If you can reproduce the problem, would you mind to apply this patch and 
let us know if this solves the problem?
Thanks
Reiner
