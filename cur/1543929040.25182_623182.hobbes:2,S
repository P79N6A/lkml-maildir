Subject: [PATCH 25/28] blk_end_request: add callback feature (take 3)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/30/322

This patch adds a variant of the interface, blk_end_request_callback(),
which has driver callback feature.
There are 2 drivers which need to do special works between
end_that_request_first() and end_that_request_last():
ide-cd and scsi bidi.
For such drivers, blk_end_request_callback() allows it to pass
a callback function which is called between end_that_request_first()
and end_that_request_last().
This interface should/will be removed, after the drivers remove
such tricky behaviors.
o ide-cd (cdrom_newpc_intr())
  cdrom_newpc_intr() needs to:
    1. call post_transform_command() to modify request contents
    2. wait completing request until DRQ_STAT is cleared
  after end_that_request_first() and before end_that_request_last().
  As for the second one, ide-cd will wait for the interrupt from device.
  So end_that_request_first() and end_that_request_last() are called
  separately in ide-cd.
  This means blk_end_request_callback() has to return without
  completing request even if no leftover in the request.
  To satisfy the requirement, callback function has return value
  so that drivers can tell blk_end_request_callback() to return
  without completing request.
o scsi mid-layer for bidi request (scsi_end_bidi_request())
  Bidi sets its specific value to rq->data_len before the request is
  completed so that upper-layer can read it.
  This setting must be between end_that_request_chunk() and
  end_that_request_last(), because rq->data_len may be used
  in end_that_request_chunk() by blk_trace and so on.

+ * blk_end_request_callback - Special helper function for tricky drivers
+ * @rq:           the request being processed
+ * @uptodate:     1 for success, 0 for I/O error, < 0 for specific error
+ * @nr_bytes:     number of bytes to complete
+ * @drv_callback: function called between completion of bios in the request
+ *                and completion of the request.
+ *                If the callback returns non 0, this helper returns without
+ *                completion of the request.
+ *
+ * Description:
+ *     Ends I/O on a number of bytes attached to @rq.
+ *     If @rq has leftover, sets it up for the next range of segments.
+ *
+ *     This special helper function is used only for existing tricky drivers.
+ *     (e.g. cdrom_newpc_intr() of ide-cd)
+ *     This interface will be removed when such drivers are rewritten.
+ *     Don't use this interface in other places anymore.
+ *
+ * Return:
+ *     0 - we are done with this request
+ *     1 - this request is not freed yet.
+ *         this request still has pending buffers or
+ *         the driver doesn't want to finish this request yet.
