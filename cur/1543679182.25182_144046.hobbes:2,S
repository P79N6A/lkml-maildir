Further info on this, x86info gives the following results:

Found 2 CPUs
CPU #1
Family: 6 Model: 6 Stepping: 1 [Athlon 4 (Palomino core) Rev A2]
Processor name string: AMD Athlon(tm) MP
PowerNOW! Technology information
Available features:
        Temperature sensing diode present.
CPU #2
Family: 6 Model: 6 Stepping: 2 [Athlon MP]
Processor name string: AMD Athlon(tm) Processor
PowerNOW! Technology information
Available features:
        Temperature sensing diode present.
It looks like the processors may have been from two different batches!
How bizarre. Should this make any difference?
