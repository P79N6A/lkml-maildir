Subject: [PATCH 114/114] x86/Voyager: move to the X86_32_NON_STANDARD code section
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2009/1/28/598

Make Voyager depend on X86_32_NON_STANDARD - it is a non-standard 32-bit
SMP architecture.
