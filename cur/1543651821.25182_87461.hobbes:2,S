I've toyed with this idea, but wondered if perhaps a seperate
document would be a better idea. Ie, keep this one as a
end-users guide, and have a seperate programmers guide
covering things like API changes and the likes.
The latter would likely be more time consuming than the former,
we'll see how things go..

Wasn't there also some issue in various drivers ? I believe Alan cited
the 8390 net driver as one example.

*sigh* politics. I changed that text after Albert mailed me complaining
about the original. Something tells me I'm not going to be able to
please both of you.  I'll mangle it again, and see which one of you
complains next time 8-)
All other suggestions added/changed/etc.
Thanks for the feedback
