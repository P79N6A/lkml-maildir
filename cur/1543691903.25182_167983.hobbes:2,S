Subject: Multiple TCP connections serving the same NFS mount?

Has anyone seen or tried an NFS client which uses multiple parallel TCP connections for a single
mount
 to an NFS server?
This could be helpful when the server side (outside our control) has a very conservative send
window, 
but the bandwidth and latency between the two is large. 
TIA
