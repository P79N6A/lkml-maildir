I derived from the code that the cache is actually another block device
and not memory. Maybe you should give a little more description and
a sample 'dmsetup create' statement.

Yes, I like the idea. It would be also possible to use NV-Ram 
as write back cache, for example in notebooks, to avoid 
disk spin-ups or to improve transaction performance in
enterprise applications.
Maybe it would also make sense to prefill the cache contents
on startup with a bulk I/O request?
Comments on the code:
- The data of the write back cache should be flushed on suspend and not
  in the destructor.
- You don't keep track of I/O on the fly to the cache that is mapped
  directly in cache_hit(). How do you make sure that this I/O is completed 
  before you replace a cache block?
- The cache block index is hashed, this means the cache data blocks are not 
  clustered. I don't think you can solve this problem with a proper hash function. 
  Perhaps you should consider a (B-)Tree structure for that.
Best,
Jens
