I have local patches which do the same and have been using them for about
a year too (also at 115k). Regarding the parallel port aspect of the card,
i have tested using shared IRQs by running an epat cdrom via said port and
generating a high amount of serial i/o
00:10.0 Communication controller: NetMos Technology 222N-2 I/O Card (2S+1P) (rev 01)
Last time i posted regarding this, Tim Waugh says that the cards brought
about a number of issues, of which i am unable to recollect.
