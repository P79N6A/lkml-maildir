Ok, I did my own versions, since (a) I had already started and your
patches wouldn't apply, and (b) I hate adding a zillion lines of extra
copyright notices for a 5-line function and (c) I think your patch had
EXPORT_SYMBOL wrong.
In particular, if any architecture ever decides to roll their own
version of strlcpy/strlcat, the EXPORT_SYMBOL() in ksyms.c would be the
wrong thing to do. 
The current BK tree has my totally untested versions of these functions
("Famous last words: 'how hard can it be?'"), along with what I think
is the proper way to export them.
