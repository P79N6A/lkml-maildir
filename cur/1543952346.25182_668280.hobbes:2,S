Great idea.  Except that the disk array has millisecond level latency,
when what we trying to achieve is microsecond level latency.

So you could potentially connect to a _huge_ disk array and write deltas
to it.  The disk array would have to support roughly 3 Gbytes/second of
write bandwidth to keep up with the Violin ramdisk.  Doable, but you are
now in the serious heavy iron zone.
Personally, I like my nice simple design a lot more.  Just mirror it, as
many times as you need to satisfy your paranoia.  Or how about go write
your own?
