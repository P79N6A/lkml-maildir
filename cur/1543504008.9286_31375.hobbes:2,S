Hmmm... Well, I will grant that your experience with UPS's is
certainly FAR FAR greater than mine.  No contest.
I prefer BEST nonetheless due to experiences of others with
compatibility, and lots of very good reports from Best users.
And some from first hand experience.  I've never seen a Best UPS
die, nor heard of it from anyone I deal with.  However, as I
said, you're expertise in this is certainly much more extensive.
I've had very good experience talking with Best, and with working
with their hardware.  As such, I prefer them over APC.  My
viewpoint however is different though as well, so...

I agree.  ;o)

Hehhe.  My fuse just gets lit in a rather uncontrollable way when
I see some company abusing GPL and the other free software
projects that I advocate and stand up for.  I feel someone needs
to protect what we have or it doesn't mean much.  It has caused
some very heated debate and name calling though!  For the most
part every time things work out good in the end, and the fire
settles with much agreement and things worked out.  ;o)

Hheheeh.  That shows them how "special" their protocol is doesn't
it?  ;o)

A very admirable effort indeed!

I wasn't aware of that part.  What part of international law
affected the project's release?

Well, now that your program is GPL, I am certainly fairly
indifferent to APC from the point of attacking them and whatnot.
I vote with my wallet, and encourage others to do the same,
however if APC were to "see the light" in an honest way, I could
very well change my strong opinion of them indeed.
If I could obtain new batteries for my UPS at a reasonable cost
(or free) and could actually evaluate the fruit of all of the
debate (and your labors) I'd possibly feel better about the
company as well.  My UPS unfortunately has dead batteries now,
which met their untimely demise approx 2 days prior to your GPL
release... ;o(

That just made it more fun...  come on, admit it.  ;o)

I can't really give an opinion on that as I haven't really
looked.

A lot of things must be considered to answer that, and it will
vary from individual to individual, from experience, and from
morals/values/ethics/cause/whatever...
For company:  Best
because they do support Linux to start with, even if some people
feel that it isn't the best form of support.
Hardware: Best
Why?  Because I've had nothing but trouble with my APC UPS, and
other people that I've discussed with as well. So although my
statistics may be wrong in the bigger picture, I have no way of
knowing currently, as I can only postulate based on my own
experience, and Best UPS's have not had any problems in my
experience, and that of close others..
Having the APC UPS for about 10 months or so without any working
software in Linux caused a big problem for me a couple of times,
and as such, their UPS was unreliable in my situation.  Mostly
due to lack of Linux support from them, and the fact that I
couldn't get the apcupsd to work which was ALSO their fault
because of the way they forced you more or less to not release
source.  I was ticked off as you know, and am glad that you won
in the end!  Certainly a victory for us, and open-source indeed!

Well, that said, I agree from a software perspective, however I
still have a bad taste about APC - the company.  I don't want to
support them partially for a similar reason I won't support
Microsoft.  I like friendly companies that are more open,
companies like Corel for example, or open-source companies.
Companies that choose to not support my platform, and not to
allow others to do so as well, are simply not going to get used
by me or recommended by me, even if they are the superior product
- except in certain circumstances where it is in my best interest
for a particular situation.
Nonetheless, it is interesting seeing this discussion resurface a
bit in a more casual way.  Much better than the lava discussions
last year!  ;o)
Take care Andre!
P.S.  <CHOKE>Do you know a good place I could buy APC batteries
for my SmartUPS 600?  Even though it would be supporting them.
;o)  </CHOKE>
Even better, if APC were to send them to me for free, I could
possibly be swayed a bit, and gargle the bad taste away with some
Lavoris...  ;o)
