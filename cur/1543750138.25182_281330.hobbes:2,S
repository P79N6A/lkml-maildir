IMHO this is counter productive.
Most of these options are pure braindamage (they were obsoleted to
verify what is what) and they paper over real bugs in core or host drivers.
What do you need 'serialize' option for?

It is on purpose, we really don't need 'ide_' prefix in ide_hwif_t.
The rest of ide_dma_* functions will lose ide_* prefix over time.
