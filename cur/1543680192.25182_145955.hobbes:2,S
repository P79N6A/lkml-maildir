That's no unclean. It is the purpose of the patch. You can do now :
	/* Remotely */
	dup2(3, 4);
	...
	evt.data.ptr = mydata0;
	evt.event = EPOLLIN | EPOLLET;
	epoll_ctl(epfd, EPOLL_CTL_ADD, 3, &evt);
	evt.data.ptr = mydata1;
	evt.event = EPOLLOUT | EPOLLET;
	epoll_ctl(epfd, EPOLL_CTL_ADD, 4, &evt);
And receive two different events for "mydata0" and "mydata1". That's what
you really link to.

This is false. Internally it's the file* that is the sink for events. So
they will receive events as long as the originator file* is alive.

This is false too. When the last user (file count) of the underneath file*
will drop it, it will be cleaned. This is not a memory leak in books where
I studied. Is like saying that :
int main() {
	int i;
	for (i = 0; i < 1000; i++)
		open(...);
	for (;;)
		sleep(1);
	return 0;
}
is a memory leak ;)

The architecture is all based on the file*, it is there that events shows
up. The (file*, fd) key is a constraint.
