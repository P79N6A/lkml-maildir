I assume this is using the ondemand governor and not userspace?
(some older distros mistakingly used "userspace" and yes, that will
suck)
# cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor 
ondemand
(to make it easily cut-n-pastable to check)

if you can give a simple recipe for one of these, we can add it to our
workload testsuite that at least some of us use every time we change
either the C states or the cpufreq stuff....
(and yes we want to improve things)
