Those patches did only the conversion of
static spinlock_t lock = SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED;
       lock = SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED;
to
static DEFINE_SPINLOCK(lock);
       spin_lock_init(lock);
If you want to do static initialization inside of structures, then you
have to define a seperate MACRO similar to the static initialization of
list_head's inside of structures:
static struct sysfs_dirent sysfs_root = {
        .s_sibling      = LIST_HEAD_INIT(sysfs_root.s_sibling),
