EIP:    0010:[swap_out+95/220]
The problem is that klogd stamps on the log entries before ksymoops
even sees them, klogd removes critical information.  Either start klogd
with the -x option (do not resolve oops in klogd) or apply patch
ftp://ftp.ocs.com.au/pub/ksymoops/patch-sysklogd-1-3-31-ksymoops-1.gz
The latter patch doubles up the output lines, you get one set with
klogd's symbol conversion and one set with raw data for ksymoops to
use.
