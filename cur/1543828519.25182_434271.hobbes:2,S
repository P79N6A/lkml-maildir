The main issue is that the mapping between pthread_t and and PID is only 
known by NPTL.  A thread can find it's own PID (for purposes of resource 
groups) but it can't find the PID of other threads given their pthread_t.
Essentially I'm looking for cpu-group equivalents to:
pthread_setschedparam()
pthread_getschedparam()
pthread_attr_setschedpolicy()
pthread_attr_getschedpolicy()
It's not absolutely critical, but we did add it to our current NPTL.
