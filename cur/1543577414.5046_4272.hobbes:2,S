Alright.
I hear about the 2.4.0 release.  I have, in my mailbox, many messages
titled "Re: And oh, btw...", BUT NO ORIGINAL MESSAGE!  What happened?
Is my stupid mailserver selective or something?
Anyways.  My bug report is: "linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org does not send
me important mails that are important and that should be sent due to
their high importancy."
