No, we need to just change the kernel to sit and spin for a while if the
root partition is not found.  This is the main problem right now for
booting off of a USB device (or any other "slow" to discover device.)
It's a known kernel issue, and there are patches for 2.4 for this, but
no one has taken the time to update them for 2.6.

Yes, for most drivers they are broken.  Like sound, usb, and others.

Fine with me, I've been wanting to do that for years.  Are you willing
to handle the fallout of such a patch though?  :)

What do you mean?  What kind of relationship do you need explained about
them?
