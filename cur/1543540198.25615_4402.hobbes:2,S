Debian policy say it's other way around ( see
http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch3.html#s3.1.2
 ) ... I think it's
correct: it's easy to understood that if you have /usr/local/share/emacs
directory that you can put files there. It MUCH harder to notice that
if you'll CREATE directory there and THEN put stuff in there emacs will
spot it.

Yeah ? Where to point it then ?

Not all programs have such automagic installation mechanism in place. When
it's enough to put file in there it really looks like overkill to develop
one.
