first of all, apart from this oops all other oopses I reported were with a 
not-tainted kernel. You might want to read the other mails I have sent.
Also, besides of the reiser4 patch there is no other patch added to the 
kernel. And since people have had  successfully reported problems with 
heavily distro-patched kernels in the past it looks a little bit hypocritical 
to put my reports aside because of one single patch - don't you think?
Glück Auf,
Volker
