I'll add that it doesn't support all Lucent winmodems yet -- just
the Toshiba laptop ones and any compatibles.
But soon it will support every Lucent winmodem we know about.

want to make sure we have a suitable interface to the DSPs too at I
intend to use them.

I don't think so.  Ingo's low latency patch should give us all the
guarantee we need.
