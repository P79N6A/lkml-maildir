I had to rebuild it 2 extra times to get all the options right, partially 
my fault.  But once my usual .config was achieved, it back to business as 
usual, complete with my logs being littered with this message:
Oct  5 11:14:40 coyote kernel: usb 3-2.1: reset low speed USB device using 
ohci_hcd and address 3
This is my only (so far) minor nit to pick.
[root@coyote linux-2.6.19-rc1]# lsusb
[...]
Bus 003 Device 003: ID 045e:008c Microsoft Corp.
[...]
Now, I'd assume its referring to my mouse, the Microsoft Corp entry above, 
which has had a fresh set of batteries installed without effecting this, 
and I even removed the batteries from another usb/bluetooth mouse I use on 
my lappy when its powered up, all without effecting this apparently 
innocuous error as the mouse itself works just fine.  The receiver is 
about 3 feet away as the tower is at least 5 feet away, under an adjacent 
desk.
This started at about the same time I jumped from a 2.6.16-something to the 
2nd rc of 2.6.18, and has continued more or less un-abated since.  Doing a 
reset/reconfigure on the mouse and base station does not appear to 
generate any log messages, nor to effect the random logging of the above 
messages.
Does anyone have a suggestion?
