I didn't know a K6-2 had mtrr support (I thought it wasn't that much PPro
based).
Anyway you probably got this from the text file in the documentation
directory. That file is wrong. You have to append it not force overwrite
it. So this would be:
echo "base=0xe8000000 size=0x10000000 type=write-combining" >> /proc/mtrr
