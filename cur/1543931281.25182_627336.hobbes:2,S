That is a *terrible* disgusting way to use yield.  Better options:
   (1) inotify/dnotify
   (2) create a "foo.lock" file and put the mutex in that
   (3) just start with the check-file-and-sleep loop.

It works better than doing the wait-loop from the start?  What  
evidence do you provide to support this assertion?  Specifically, in  
the first case you tell the kernel "I'm waiting for something but I  
don't know what it is or how long it will take"; while in the second  
case you tell the kernel "I'm waiting for something that will take  
exactly X milliseconds, even though I don't know what it is.  If you  
really want something similar to the old behavior then just replace  
the "sched_yield()" call with a proper sleep for the estimated time  
it will take the program to create the file.

We weren't looking for "actual uses", especially not in binary-only  
apps.  What we are looking for is optimal uses of sched_yield(); ones  
where that is the best alternative.  This... certainly isn't.
