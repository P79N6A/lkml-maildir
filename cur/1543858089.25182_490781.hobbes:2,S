What system call interface do Mach-O binaries use? Is it the old stupid 
"lcall 7,0" thing, or does it use "sysenter" or something like that?
If it's sysenter, it's going to be "interesting". That code currently 
doesn't support any kind of emulation, and the whole "sysenter" interface 
is pretty grotty at a CPU level (it doesn't even save eip etc). So you'd 
need to delve into x86 asm and arch/i386/kernel/entry.S (or the x86-64 
equivalent).
