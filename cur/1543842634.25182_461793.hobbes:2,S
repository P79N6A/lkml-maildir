Subject: DVB build fails without I2C

In an effort to speed up my all-filesystems build, I disabled several 
things in my allyesconfig-generated .config.  As luck would have it, I 
wound up disabling I2C but did not disable DVB.
This led to a link failure at the end of the build, with the linker 
complaining that many I2C-related symbols were not present.
Recommended solution:  Add I2C as a dependency (or select) in DVB Kconfig.
