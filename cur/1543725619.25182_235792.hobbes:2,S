I have to agree with Adrian, the first thing I always do with a new
distro is rip out the kernel and drop in a vanilla from kernel.org.
I've been biten too many times by distro kernels. :(

imho, I feel there are two main concerns with changing the development
model:
	1.) Need to have readily identifiable stable versions w/o
	    following lkml.
	2.) Understanding the changing of version numbers in light of
	    this change of strategy.
Ideas:
wrt (1), I think the -rc? system would be simplest.  2.6.20 is stable,
2.6.20-rc3 is not.  
wrt (2), assuming the naming stays the same:
	major++ = major overhaul of core system.
	minor++ = overhaul to drivers (or subset thereof).
	patch++ = testing patches survived, appear stable.
	extra++ = next set of testing patches applied.
Sure, this would mean version numbers start to creap up, but nothing is
stopping a kernel version 2.11.x (what?! where's my 3.0.1?  We were
definitely supposed to have a 3.0 around here somewhere... Where's my
meds? *frowns*).
tia,
Cooper.
