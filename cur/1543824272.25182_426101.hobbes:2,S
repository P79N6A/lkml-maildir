RHAT ships the same mmap() and stack randomization mainline does; plus
heap randomization.  paxtest claims RHAT does something like 1 or 2 more
bits of mmap() randomization than mainline does on i386 as of FC5; but
that regression test in paxtest is a bit flakey.  It nails the stack
randomization dead on.
I think if RHAT did break Oracle, Oracle would just ship with
PT_GNU_STACK, which enables an executable stack (!) and disables stack
and mmap() randomization (!!).  Who would notice anyway?  Maybe auditors
looking at every flag set on every binary on the system.
Now, if RHAT had to write SELinux policy, and upped randomization to
better protect Apache, but had to explicitly keep it low for Oracle,
that would be very transparent to the RHAT developers and to policy
auditors.  Would anyone notice?  Probably not.
If RHAT FORCED Oracle to use higher randomization, it would break.
Oracle Inc. would then recommend against using RHAT, instead advising
the use of Solaris or Win2k3.  Why?  It's easier to advise migration
than fix code, especially when you can point out exactly what the
platform you broke on changed and prove that it's not really your fault.

It's a command line option.  It happens as soon as you change menu.lst
or lilo.conf or screw with the command line at boot time.  Do you want
me to write some kind of Documentation/address-randomization.txt
explaining it?
Remember in the future I want to buff out the command line option (two
short functions, just delete them outright along with the __setup()
below them) for SELinux policy controls.  The impacts and possible
problems could be documented right in the SELinux policy controls.
At the very least a user has to do some digging to find out these are
there; then he has to determine what they do and figure out if this is a
good thing.  Writing right in the documents, "Turning entropy up too
high may cause certain programs to segfault," will place the more timid
users in a "Let's not touch this" state most of the time; if it doesn't,
they're the ones that break something we warned them would break and
then ask us about it anyway.
