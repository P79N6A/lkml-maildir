Well the 450 cylinders there is right, so why is the driver passing info
down to user space saying the device has 448 cylinders?  Somehow you are
loosing 2 cylinders in your driver somewhere.

Well if the partition table/fs size is larger than the device currently
claims to be, the FS will fail and mount will fail.  Nothing wrong in
mount, just broken device driver.

Perhaps adding more debuging to your driver wherever user space calls in
to get the size of the device, to make sure you have the right
information passed along.  Heads and sectors looks fine, but the
cylinder count needs fixing since it is currently reporting 2 less than
it really is.  This has to be 100% a problem in the device driver.
