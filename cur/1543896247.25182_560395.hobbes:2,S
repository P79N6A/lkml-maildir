OK, I see now:

This format is just awful for parsing.  It's pretty clearly totally
ad-hoc.  It's not even self-consistent (it uses different separators,
etc, in the same file!)  It's reasonably compact for human consumption,
but it doesn't show what the arrays mean.
Heck, XML would have been better than this mess...
