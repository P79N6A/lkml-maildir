Probably. But I'll like leave the 2.4 driver alone. I'm about to fork my
bk repository into 2.2, 2.4 and 2.5 streams and put the 2.4 version into
maintenance mode. 
It turns out that there are other reasons why I maintain an internal
queue that have to do more with hiding fibre channel issues. For
example, if I get a LIP or an RSCN, I have to go out and re-evaluate the
loop/fabric and make sure I've tracked any changes in the identity of
the devices. The cleanest way to handle this right now for linux is to
accept comamnds, disable the scsi timer on them, and restart them once I
get things sorted out again. Maybe this will change for 2.5.
