Actually, the correct fix is to check in ext2_read_super() whether the
blocksize is larger than EXT2_MAX_BLOCK_SIZE like ext3 does, and maybe
even fix up the code drift between that part of ext2_read_super() and
ext3_read_super()...
Both ext2 and ext3 will in theory support a blocksize up to PAGE_SIZE,
but nobody with access to a > 4kB PAGE_SIZE system has bothered to test
whether it works, so EXT[23]_MAX_BLOCK_SIZE has not been increased.
Any e2fsprogs from the last year or so will support larger blocksizes,
but it has never been tested AFAIK.
Cheers, Andreas
