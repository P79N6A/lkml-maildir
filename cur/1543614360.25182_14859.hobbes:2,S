Here are some patches to get broken SCSI drivers going
in lk 2.5.2-pre1 :
http://www.torque.net/sg/p/advansys.c252p1min.diff
is a minimal hack to get the advansys adapter driver
going. Hopefully a more solid patch from its
maintainer will follow shortly.
http://www.torque.net/sg/p/sg252p1_2.diff.gz
 resyncs
the sg driver with lk 2.4.17 and adds some scatterlist
changes required by 2.5 .
http://www.torque.net/sg/p/scsi_debug252p1.diff.gz
 replaces
the existing scsi_debug "fake" adapter driver with something
that is like a ram disk, that can accept fdisk, mkfs, mount
etc. I have used it in the past to test Richard Gooch's
sd-many patch.
