Can the folks submitting all of the kprobe stuff at least consult me
when they can't figure out how to implement the sparc64 kprobe variant
for new features?
Currently, the sparc64 build is broken by recent kprobe
changes:
kernel/built-in.o: In function `init_kprobes':
: undefined reference to `arch_init'
Also, can we use a more namespace friendly name for this kprobe layer
specific function other than "arch_init()"?
Thanks.
