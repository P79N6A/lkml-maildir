What happens if you 'field upgrade' ext2 to ext3 by adding a journal? That 
doesn't magically convert !utf-8 to utf-8.

Hold up. Unless the original encoding is 'wrong' and has two mapped characters 
that, in reality, are the same character, no such uniqueness should stop. 
(This implies the encoding that we switched to 'fixed' said 'bug')

Thats a fault of the file system design, not of the encoding. File systems 
should not have very short filenames.
