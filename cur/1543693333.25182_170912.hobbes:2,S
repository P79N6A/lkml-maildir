Eek, thanks to you I just figured out that one of my fileserver
harddrives has degraded its connection settings. After reactivating DMA
though I have the usual speeds also on a K7S5A:
egger@karin:~$ sudo hdparm -tT /dev/hdc
/dev/hdc:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   800 MB in  2.00 seconds = 400.00 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  120 MB in  3.01 seconds =  39.87 MB/sec
egger@karin:~$ sudo hdparm -tT /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   800 MB in  2.00 seconds = 400.00 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:   82 MB in  3.00 seconds =  27.33 MB/sec

Servus,
