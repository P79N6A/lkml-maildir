Hi,
my system runs on an Epox 8KHA+ Via KT266A (VT8366/A + VT8233) with 4
IDE devices: hda, hdb and hdc are harddrives, hdd is a Teac CD-W512E.
All devices are at least UDMA2 capable and DMA is turned on via hdparm.
Writing to a CD works fine with cdrecord and ide-scsi-emulation. But
whenever I access hdc, cdrecord stops with
[...]
Track 01:   0 of 630 MB written.cdrecord: Input/output error. write_g1:
scsi sendcmd: no error
CDB:  2A 00 00 00 01 36 00 00 1F 00
status: 0x2 (CHECK CONDITION)
Sense Bytes: 70 00 05 00 00 00 00 0A 00 00 00 00 24 00 00 00
Sense Key: 0x5 Illegal Request, Segment 0
Sense Code: 0x24 Qual 0x00 (invalid field in cdb) Fru 0x0

Sense Bytes: 70 00 00 00 00 00 00 0A 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
and
hdd: status error: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
hdd: drive not ready for command
hdd: status error: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
hdd: drive not ready for command
hdd: status error: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
hdd: drive not ready for command
in /var/log/messages. This happens under 2.4.18 and 2.4.19 if
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_VIA82CXXX is set. Without support for the chipset
everything works fine and transfer rates of 30MB/s to/from hdc while
burning with nearly no load are possible. Why does the support for the
chipset make so much problems?
Regards,
Torsten
