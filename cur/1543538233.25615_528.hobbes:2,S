Hi.
When booting a stock RH 6.2 system with 2.2.17pre10 kernel I get the
following during boot (I also get it with 2.2.16 and the stock RH 6.2
kernel):
Partition check:
 hda:hda: set_multmode: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hda: set_multmode: error=0x04 { DriveStatusError }
 hda1 hda2 < hda5 hda6 hda7 hda8 hda9 hda10 >
I have trawled the archives and found a patch (2.2.7.uniform-ide-6.19.
golf.patch) from Andre Hedrick that I read as fixing this. But I also
gathered that it should have been folded into 2.2.9 (or so) and thus
already applied in the kernels I use. So is this a known error (and in that
case is the error fatal for me?), is it a hardware error or is it my fault?
I have tried to compile the kernel without default dma, without
generic bus-mastering DMA PCI support and without generic PCI IDE
chipset support. None made a difference (and I dont know if they
should have, I was just flailing in the dark).
I sure to have missed something obvious to include in this mail so
please mail me for more info.
The system:
Pentium 200, 64MB RAM. hda is a seagate st33221A 3.2GB disk.
