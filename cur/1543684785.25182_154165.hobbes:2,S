Actually, the above is "undefined behaviour", since it has _two_ 
assignments in the same thing. Exactly because "do_div()" modifies both 
the first argument _and_ returns a value. So depending on the 
implementation of do_div() (whether there are any sequence points etc) and 
on random compiler behaviour (if there are no sequence points in do_div() 
internally), in the example above "nativeMb" migth be totally undefined 
after the above.
And yes, as a special case, it might be the divisor.
I agree that "do_div()" has strange semantics and is very likely misnamed,
but they are kind of forced upon us by the fact that C functions cannot
return two values. Renaming do_div() at this point is just going to make
it harder to write kernel- portable source, so I suspect we're better off
just commenting it, and making people aware of how do_div() works.
Not very many people should use "do_div()" directly (and a quick grep
shows that not very many people do). It's generally a mistake to do so, I
suspect. The thing was originally written explicitly for "printk()" and
nothing else.
