I'd rather we kept printk messages as one printk if at all possible.
How about encapsulating both of these conditions into an inline
function:
static inline int mmc_blk_readonly(struct mmc_card *card)
{
	return mmc_card_readonly(card) ||
	       !(card->csd.cmdclass & CCC_BLOCK_WRITE);
}

As a bonus, I think this makes the code a lot more readable... but
then I am biased. 8)
