Yes there a risk of wrapping, but it is very small. You can add the command
line arguments to the file name if you want, like this :
#!/bin/sh
exec strace -f -o "output.$$.${*//\//_}" /bin/real.tar $@
It will name the output file "output.<pid>.<args>", replacing slashes with
underscores. This is very dirty but can help.
Cheers,
