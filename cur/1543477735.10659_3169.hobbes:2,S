I disagree here.  Although perhaps the exact terminology should be changed,
it does need to be stressed how many different platforms that Linux can
run on.  After all, that's one of our strengths over the Microsoft Operating
Systems, right?
Something like: "Not only does Linux run on the Intel architecture which
features
in the majority of the world's PCs, it also runs on....." etc.
An aside about the fact that people have even got it booting on Palm Pilots
and
the like would be cute too. ;)
