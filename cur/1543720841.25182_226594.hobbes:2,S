Note my refining email elsewhere in this thread...
I am talking about the default handling of programs that are not marked PT_GNU_STACK.
The proposed /proc/self/NX file tweak does nothing to programs with the protected
stack flag (they are "locked" against executable data, instead of just resistant to
it).
It is better to protect "most of" these uncontrollable, old, legacy, or closed source
apps by default, and provide a means for those that must have it otherwise (e.g.
WINE) to exercise some control as to when or if the exposure is granted.
Consider a "sort of savvy normal user." I go and get this kernel, and build it, and
put it on my existing box.  My security level has changed not-at-all because none of
my apps are marked PT_GNU_STACK.  I don't actually see any improvement until I
recompile my distro.
With the proposed change the default can be everything-is-NX but unmarked apps can
"demote themselves" to the old behavior.  I discover that I have some app that breaks
hideously.  I can use a shim "LD_PRELOAD=libEX.so app" that opens the NX restriction
for that app.
Yes, this "raises the exposure" for all the "protected by default" apps if the
program is broken enough and the attacker is savvy enough, but these old apps have no
protection under the new system anyway, so better to protect most of them, and let
some of them slip-by if they need to, than protect none of them at all.
Rob.

It clearly wouldn't be safe, and that keeps it from being effective. 
Like having a great lock and burglar alarm, then putting the key and 
entry code under the mat. NX is to prevent abuse by BAD PEOPLE and 
therefore should not have any way to defeat it from within a program.
