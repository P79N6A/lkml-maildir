Ok, I just got your usage cases confused.
The argument stays the same: some controllers/drivers may have subtle 
behavioural differences that come from the IO limits themselves.
So it wasn't AACRAID, it was CCISS+LVM. The argument is the same: it may 
well be that the *bigger* IO sizes are actually what hurts, even if the 
conventional wisdom is traditionally that bigger submissions are better.

I think you need to ask the MD/DM people for suggestions.. Who aren't cc'd 
here.
