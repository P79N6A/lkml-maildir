If sync_file_range isn't safe, it should get replaced by a noop
implementation.  There really is no point in promising "a little"
safety.
One interesting aspect of this comes with COW filesystems like btrfs or
logfs.  Writing out data pages is not sufficient, because those will get
lost unless their referencing metadata is written as well.  So either we
have to call fsync for those filesystems or add another callback and let
filesystems override the default implementation.
