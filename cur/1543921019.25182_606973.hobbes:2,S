It's not really any different than issuing capget(0x19980330) (assuming
capget64 is different), and getting -EINVAL when the actual in-use
caps are > 32 bits wide.  In either case the rules are the same --
old interface works fine as long as you don't have new caps involved.
Only advantage I see to using the extant interface is that the cap[sg]et
interface is already designed to be future-proof (albeit in an unusual
way compared with most other kernel syscalls).
