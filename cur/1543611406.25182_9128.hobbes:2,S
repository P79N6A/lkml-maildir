hi all,
I upgrade my thinkpad with Mandrake 8.1 and with my "old" kernel 2.4.14.
When I try to bring up the eth0 interface the following message appears:
    Cannot open netlink socket: Address family not supported by protocol
but all semms to work fine.
Please can tell me if I miss somethig in my kernel config file?
Thanks in advance for your help.
