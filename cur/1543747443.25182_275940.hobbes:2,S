thats good to hear.

i.e. pipe(2) rather than mkfifo(2) ?
it would be a complete pain because the pipes have to be
"discoverable" across processes. we would have to do fd passing, which
is still really quite ugly in linux (and other *nix systems). it
would quite difficult, though not impossible.

i am still trying to find the time to investigate futexes. they seem
close to the desired object, but have a slightly more general semantic
than i can fit into my head right now;)
