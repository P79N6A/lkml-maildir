Hi,
I've got an luser question. :-)
While running 2.4 i was able to use the following broadcom cards just
fine:
Broadcom Gigabit Ethernet Driver bcm5700 with Broadcom NIC
Extension
(NICE) ver.
 6.0.5 (04/14/03)
eth0: Broadcom BCM5703 1000Base-T found at mem fcf10000, IRQ 28, node addr
000bd
be76f62
eth0: Broadcom BCM5703 Integrated Copper transceiver found
eth0: Scatter-gather ON, 64-bit DMA ON, Tx Checksum ON, Rx Checksum ON
eth1: Broadcom BCM5703 1000Base-T found at mem fcf00000, IRQ 29, node addr
000bd
be76f63
eth1: Broadcom BCM5703 Integrated Copper transceiver found
eth1: Scatter-gather ON, 64-bit DMA ON, Tx Checksum ON, Rx Checksum ON
bcm5700: eth0 NIC Link is UP, 100 Mbps full duplex
bcm5700: eth1 NIC Link is UP, 100 Mbps full duplex
Now i build a 2.6.3 kernel and im looking where there is support for these
cards. In menuconfig i went to:
Device Drivers -> Networking Support -> Ethernet 1000mbit
And in here i only see broadcom tigon3 support
And in Ethernet 10-100Mbit i only see:
Broadcom 4400 ethernet support
No where appears to be bcm5703 support.
Where should i be in the config of the kernel to enable bcm5703 support?
Thanks,
Mipam.
