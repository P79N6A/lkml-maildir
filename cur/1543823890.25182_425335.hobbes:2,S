Modern machines have ability to be "speed controlled" - Perhaps
they can cut their speed by 1/3 or 1/2, but run slower anyway
in the name of energy conservation.
Another approach (not thinking on multiprocessor systems now)
is to somehow gobble up system performance into some "hoarder"
(highest scheduling priority, eats up 90% of time slices doing
excellent waste of CPU resources..)
Combine that with internal timer ticking at 1000 or 1024 Hz, and
you do get fairly good approximation of a machine running at 1/10
of its real speed.
Kernel IO tasks might skew statistics a bit, but that is another story.
In multiprocessor systems similar hoarders do work combined with
CPU Affinity - one hoarder for each processor.
