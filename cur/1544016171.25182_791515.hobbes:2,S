Your oom_adj scores should never need to be changed unless you're tuning 
the inherited value of a child; it simply represents your input into when 
a specific task should be considered rogue enough to target.
However, patches to improve the documentation of the oom killer, or any 
other kernel feature, are always welcome.

Children are already preferred over the chosen parent task, as I've 
explained a few times.  When a task is identified for oom kill by the 
badness heuristics, the oom killer attempts to kill a child that does not 
share the same mm first, which is exactly what you're asking for here.  If 
the parent shares the mm, it needs to exit as well before memory freeing 
may occur.
