Could you comment next couple lines of code (2.4.19-vanilla):
==========================================
#else /* !CONFIG_PDC202XX_FORCE */
[ ... skipped ... ]
        {DEVID_PDC20265,"PDC20265" .... OFF_BOARD ..... },
                                        ^^^^^^^^^
[ ... skipped ... ]
#endif
==========================================
Another bug? Just typo?
Why author put PDC20265 in off-board list ?
