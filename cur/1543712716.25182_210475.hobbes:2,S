I will, it just wasn't high prio enough at this time (I mean, I still
have pending some prio-tree bit to fixup with the xfs, that was higher
prio since it impacts functionality, and the mremap race may also be
higher prio).
My point is that merging in your program will work fine, this is what
matters to me, it doesn't right now because I didn't fixup the merging
code yet, but there's nothing that will prevent your program to use just
1 single vma for the whole thing (after I fixup the merging code ;). The
bonus is that after I fixup the merging, it'll use 1 vma even for the
file mappings, not just for anonymous memory, something that is not true
with anonmm (and the complexity of doing file merging or anon-vma
merging is the same, so I will do both at the same cost).
