Wow, congratulations! Not too many endevour into this land, and even fewer 
succeed:-) You'd probably be better off asking this on linuxppc-dev, but 
anyway...

That interrupt numbers are different as under 2.4 is correct, however, I 
get 16 and 17 for ttyS0 and ttyS1 on a kuroboxHG, are you sure you're 
getting 17 and 18?

And here you get IRQ 16, which indeed should be ttyS0. And ttyS0 is 
connected to the power-management microcontroller (AVR). Wait, what 
userspace are you running? Have you swapped ttyS0 and ttyS1 everywhere? in 
/etc/inittab for example? Besides, if you are running any vendor provided 
(or community) tools to handle the AVR - they use ttyS1 by default, as it 
was under 2.4 ans under "traditional" 2.6, whereas the 2.6 mainline kernel 
for kurobox/linkstation uses the traditional for these CPUs port 
numbering. I think this is your problem. Some user-space programme(s) are 
accessing wrong tty.
Thanks
