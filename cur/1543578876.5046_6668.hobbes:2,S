Well actually there seems to be a way to do this. Quoting "System Management
BIOS Reference Specification" v2.3.1 (p.51):
   3.3.10 System Slots (Type 9)
   The information in this structure defines the attributes of a system
   slot. One structure is provided for each slot in the system.
And later in table 3.3.10.5 (p.53):
   Identifies the value present in the Slot Number field of the PCI Interrupt
   Routing Table entry that is associated with this slot, in offset 09h [...]
   Software can determine the PCI bus number and device associated with the
   slot by matching the "Slot ID" to an entry in the routing table... and
   ultimately determine what device is present in that slot.
Right now Linux' SMBIOS implementation use only the first 3 tables to determine
the manufacturer of system and BIOS to blacklist known buggy APM/ACPI
implementations.  Since i have the SMBIOS specs at hand i will have a lot.
Is there a PCI spec available on the net? www.pcisig.org asks for a password
when you try to download the specs... (don't you just love "secret" standards?)
Yours,
