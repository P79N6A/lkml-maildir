Trouble? Why would USB do DMA unless there was a device activity?

That could hurt the polling performance, all right. ;-)

Isn't that more or less what on demand does?
Thanks for the feedback, I can probably just say that DMA wakes the CPU 
from C3 and let it ride, I don't want to skip it, but neither do I need 
to go into detail.
