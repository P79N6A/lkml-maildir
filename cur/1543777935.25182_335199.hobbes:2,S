You can do lots of modes with relayfs already - no ping-pong buffer,
n-buffer, lossy, not lossy etc etc.
I currently use it in 'flight-recorder' mode where new messages overwrite
old ones.
It might be good to document different possible ways of using relayfs.

It's currently pretty limited - but you can add more features on top of it,
in a modular fashion. I tend not to use the complex stuff, but you can layer
it if you want.
It'd be nice if we had some basic relaying infrastructure available that'd
cover most needs successfully. Advanced users can do advanced things if they
want.
Btw, the diskstat tools (
http://ds9a.nl/diskstat
) require relayfs. It'll be
released this Friday or so.
