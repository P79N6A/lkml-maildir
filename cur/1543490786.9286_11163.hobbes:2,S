Hi,
A long time ago I wrote a toy kernel module (called Time Travel) which
intercepts all time-related system calls and shifts a particular program
into the future or past by the specified ammount.
The only SMP-consideration I encountered is that I had to compile with
-D__SMP__, otherwise things like current->comm will be NULL.
Btw, TimeTravel is available from
