It may, that wasn't my point. Your original patch had BUG_ON(1) which
by itself was weird (use BUG() instead). But then it was in the else
part of an if statement. So it read like:
if (bh) {
   ...
} else {
  if (1)
     BUG(); /* stop kernel */
}
BUG is for reporting things that should never happen (otherwise you'd
actually handle them) and so should be used in such a way that they
don't complicate the code flow.

Probably ought to go through Ogawa, if he can be convinced to take it.
Please take a look at adding -o sync and -o async options to override
the superblock flag first.
