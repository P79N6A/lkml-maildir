Well at least let's do it the Linux Kernel Way(tm):  separate out the
zerocopy stuff such that there are minimal ifdefs in the code...  For
example:
	/* add these functions... */
	#ifdef ZEROCOPY
	static inline setup_txrx_rings(...) { /*...*/ }
	#else
	static inline setup_txrx_rings(...) { /*...*/ }
	#endif
then in the code itself, where the TxRx ring setup occurs now (ie. where
ifdefs exist in the code) simply call the new static inline functions.

You totally missed my point.  It's unclean.  If you have some code that
will not work at all in the current tree, it should not be in the
current tree.  If Alan or Linus applies a starfire.c patch that includes
ZEROCOPY support while the tree as a whole does not include such
support, you are effectively including a developer-local change in the
global tree.  With your patch but without zercopy infrastructure,
defining ZEROCOPY is completely pointless without an additional,
experimental patch.
The #ifdef ZEROCOPY code you added is a classic example of the kind of
code I -remove- from the kernel tree.

excellent :)
