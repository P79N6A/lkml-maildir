There are hundreds of files in the kernel with "all rights reserved"
as part of the copyright, including things merged as recently as
ocfs2.  I don't see how this could possibly be an issue.
    Andi> 1? If it's called memcpy it should get a byte argument, no? 
    Andi> If not name it something else, otherwise everybody will be

The kernel doc for the function says
+ * @count: number of 32-bit quantities to copy
but maybe that's not the clearest way to define such a function.
    Andi> movsq? I thought you wanted 32bit IO?
The idea is to do I/O in at least 32-bit chunks to cope with hardware
that can't handle 8-bit or 16-bit accesses.  64-bit chunks are OK for
Pathscale hardware.
    Andi> The movsd also looks weird.
I think it's OK.  The code is doing:
 > +	movl %edx,%ecx
 > +	shrl $1,%ecx
 > +	andl $1,%edx
 > +	rep movsq
 > +	movl %edx,%ecx
 > +	rep movsd
 > +	ret
so it does the copy in 64-bit chunks, and then it does "rep movsd" to
copy either 0 or 1 more 32-bit words.
