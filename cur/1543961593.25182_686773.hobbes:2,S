I start to understand the problem, and I'm currently wondering why 
powerpc uses CONFIG_NVRAM although the code CONFIG_NVRAM enables on 
other platforms is not enabled on powerpc.
Can we rename it and move drivers/char/generic_nvram.c under 
arch/powerpc/ ?
Can some powerpc person bring some background what's going on and why 
it's this way?
