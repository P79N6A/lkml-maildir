That is what I would expect.

Well, the disk is slow but not that slow... For example dd creating this 
file goes at about 20-25MB/s and takes about 10 minutes IIRC, so it is not 
*that* bad...
The disk is not full or even close to:
/dev/hda4          /mnt/data        52552,1  27343,6  24140,4  54%  ext3
and file count is not that high too:
/dev/hda4            6836224   42333 6793891    1% /mnt/data
and it should not be fragmented in any way. It is rather new (3 months 
old) filesystem with several bigger files and small amount of smaller. 
Used mainly as a data store and backup. Very infrequently written to (new 
blocks/files).
I think I will test new kernel soon. Maybe with and without -ck. Maybe 
disk scheduler (probably CFQ) does something stupid... Or swap prefetch... 
Or anything...
Thanks,
