Wasn't the idea once banded about of a 2-stage unload that went
something like:
1. ->cleanup() - unregister IRQ handlers, timers, etc.
2. Quiesce the system
3. Safe to unload
surely if nothing is registered and all CPUs do a voluntary schedule()
then there can be no chance of calling back in to the module.
LOL. Or am I kidding myself here? :)
