But with multiple PCI buses, the base_address cannot be a simple bus
address, because the PCI bus number must be coded in there. For example,
on alpha the PCI_HANDLE from include/asm-alpha/pci.h is or'ed into the
base_address.
As far as I can tell, the base_address[] is always correct for ioremap.
But are the following two tricks valid:
1) Using the contents of base_address[] as an offset when mmapping
/dev/mem from userspace? 
2) Using the contents of base_address[] as a target address for peer to
peer DMA on PCI?
