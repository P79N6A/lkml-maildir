are you really sure that it is the right fix?
I mean, the batching has a basic problem (I was discussing it with Jens
two days ago and he said he's already addressed in 2.5, I wonder if that
could also have an influence on the fact 2.5 is so much better in
fariness)
the issue with batching in 2.4, is that it is blocking at 0 and waking
at batch_requests. But it's not blocking new get_request to eat requests
in the way back from 0 to batch_requests. I mean, there are two
directions, when we move from batch_requests to 0 get_requests should
return requests. in the way back from 0 to batch_requests the
get_request should block (and it doesn't in 2.4, that is the problem)
