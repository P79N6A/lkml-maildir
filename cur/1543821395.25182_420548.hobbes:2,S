Yes, the hard one would be _not_ to impact normal I/Os in any way.
A simple solution for the case of deadline scheduler would be:
- static const int read_expire = HZ / 2;  /* max time before a read is submitted. */
+ static const int read_expire = HZ / 2;  /* max time before a impending read is submitted. */
+ static const int reada_expire = HZ * 30;  /* max time before a read-ahead is submitted. */
