Hum, what's the status of the IDE stuff? Last time I looked, the Hedrick
IDE patches were for 2.2.19, and I find those rather necessary to use e.
g.  PDC20265 or UDMA on VIA chip sets. I could understand if there were
not being merged into 2.2.x because it's stable and not playground
release, but who is maintaining them now? Or did I miss anything about
2.2.20?
