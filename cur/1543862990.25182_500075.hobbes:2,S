Subject: Do SIG_DFL handlers have SA_RESTART?

Do the default signal handlers for Linux behave as if they were installed with 
SA_RESTART, or not?  (I tried querying 'em with sigaction but the defaults 
all have sa_flags 0.)
I remember years ago hitting a bug where ctrl-z followed by fg would cause 
pipelined processes to drop data, and would like to avoid that without having 
to wrap every darn syscall and check for -EINTR.  I _think_ that I just have 
to feed SA_RESTART to the signals I register handlers for myself, but I'd 
like to confirm that.
