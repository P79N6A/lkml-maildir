Subject: [2.6 patch] fs/reiserfs/stree.c: make MAX_KEY static
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/5/12/222

Since MAX_KEY no longer has any user in other files, it can be made 
static.
