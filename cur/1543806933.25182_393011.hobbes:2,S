None of the Dells we use at work (various models) handle suspend (both
ram and disk) reliably.  Got everything from not resuming when pushing
the button (PWRF not giving an ACPI event while PWRC does), screen not
coming back (as usual), system not coming back the second time (go
figure) or resume eating up / from time to time.  At that point people
there are buying Macs.
I'm going to get a sacrificial (but modern) dell laptop in a month or
two.  I'll try to make things actually reliable on that one, including
video.  I don't have great hopes though.
'course the current state of the drm/fb interaction is yet another can
of worms, one in a good way of being solved though.
  OG.
