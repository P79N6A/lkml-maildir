I've put an updated version of the rule engine on
ftp.linux.org.uk:pub/linux/alan/cml1-load.c
This allows for then to be on a line of its own and the use of 'unset' which
is an unofficial bogosity the alpha people seem to have invented
Haven't fixed the TODO items yet
Example output:
Variable CONFIG_DMA_NONPCI: 
{
    {
    All of:
        $CONFIG_IDE!= n
    }
    AND
    {
    Not all of:
        $CONFIG_BLK_DEV_TIVO= y
    }
    AND
    {
    Subset of:
        n
    }
}
OR
{
    {
    All of:
        $CONFIG_IDE!= n
    }
    AND
    {
    All of:
        $CONFIG_BLK_DEV_TIVO= y
    }
    AND
    {
    Subset of:
        y
    }
}
