There are a couple of performance related patches that should be applied
to stock 2.6.0/2.6.1. One handles a problem with remove_suid()
generating a whole load of SETATTR calls if you are writing to a file
that has the "x" bit set. The other handles an efficiency issue related
to random write + read combinations.
Either look for them on my website (under
http://www.fys.uio.no/~trondmy/src
), or apply Andrew's 2.6.1-mm2 patch.
Cheers,
