Patch support for 2.6.11 was terminated when 2.6.12 was released (and 
support for 2.6.12 was then terminated when 2.6.13 was released)
this is the way kernel development works.
anyone (including you) is allowed to pick a release and provide patch 
support for i, including backporting features from later kernels. most 
distributions do this to a greater or lesser degree.
don't expect patches from leter kernels to apply cleanly. if they do you 
are lucky, if they don't then you need to apply the 'modification; you 
mention in point3 until they do work, however you will be pretty much on 
your own for doing that work.
I can't answer your specific questions about AIO so I'll leave it at that.

There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.
