Not quite
The problem with having a library perform the operation and not kernel space
drivers is that it would require that you ship the buffer to be encrypted
over the PCI bus to the crypto accelerator, have it encrypt, ship it back
over the PCI bus to the library that would pass it on to the stack that
would ship it over the PCI bus to the NIC to go out on the wire...
While that is what you have to do for a generic hardware crypto accelerator,
I am talking about having the crypto accelerator on the NIC itself.  What I
want to do is frame the packet, build a structure to pass to the nic Out of
Band (which is how at least Intel's NIC works) that tells the nic how to
apply security.  Pass the whole packet over the PCI bus to the NIC, then
have the NIC encrypt (or decrypt) and spit it out the wire...
Doing this I can get around 80 Mbit/Sec throughput using about 1/2 of a
Celeron 500 processor on Win2K running IPsec, only doing software encryption
I can get about 12 Mbit/Sec using 100% of the same processor.  YMMV
