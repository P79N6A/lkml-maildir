Hi Adrian,
> I might be blind, but I'm not seeing what should be removed.
[wim@infomag linux-2.6]$ grep -i tco Documentation/watchdog/*
Documentation/watchdog/watchdog-api.txt:i810-tco.c -- Intel 810 chipset
Documentation/watchdog/watchdog.txt:The i810 TCO watchdog modules can be configured with the "i810_margin"
Documentation/watchdog/watchdog.txt:The i810 TCO watchdog driver also implements the WDIOC_GETSTATUS and
Documentation/watchdog/watchdog.txt:and WDIOC_GETBOOTSTATUS returns the value of TCO2 Status Register (see Intel's
Documentation/watchdog/watchdog.txt:            WDT501P         WDT500P         Software        Berkshire       i810 TCO    SA1100WD

I'll create a new patch for this that deals with the complete watchdog Documentation.
Greetings,
Wim.
