I don't think kernel.org mirrors the private home directories, so it you
do _temporary_ trees, just make them readable in your private home
directory rather than in /pub/linux/kernel/people. For people with 
kernel.org accounts, we can use that as the "bkbits.net" thing.
For really public hosting, we need to find some other approach.
