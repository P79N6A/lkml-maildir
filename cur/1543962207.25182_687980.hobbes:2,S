Well, I have an interest in collecting bits of useful infrastructure
everyone and their dog has reimplemented somewhere in the tree.

Somewhat, I debated between the kernel.h route and adding an out-of-line
version to hexdump.c.  While gcc/ld has gotten better about this, may
as well make it easy.

...you didn't even blink at my last-minute change from returning int
to u8 that was, how to say, ill-advised now that I look again :(
In any event, I'll go the lib/hexdump route and send that in a bit.
