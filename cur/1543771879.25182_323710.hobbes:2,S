Here is one possibility:
Since rc6 the difference between TASK_UNMAPPED_64 and TASK_UNMAPPED_32 is gone
and both are now merged into TASK_UNMAPPED_BASE.  Therefore we can no longer
check our local base against TASK_UNMAPPED_BASE to see if we are running in 32bit
emulation mode.  The appended patch uses other (hopefully the right) means.
Tested on x86_64 in 32 and 64 mode (64 bit fragments as desired, 32 bit
collapses as desired).
