Well, this probably should not be posted here, but who knows ? =)
Well, on arch/i386/boot/compressed/head.S line 65 we call
decompress_kernel that decompresses the kernel starting at $0x100000.
If we were loaded high, we first move the code back to $0x1000 before
ljmp'ing it.
My question is: why, when loaded high, we care to disable interrupts
(cli  # make sure we don't get interrupted) while otherwise, we don't
do that ? in both cases, aren't we supposed to disable cli (as they
can happen in both situations) ?
Since currently, the kernel boots fine for everybody in the world, I
know that this is not a bug... but why don't disable interruptions on
both cases ?
Thanks !
