I've found some problems with the 2.3.31.. The first and most glaring problem
is that someone seems to have changed the SB16 driver, I get a complaint that
the device is busy or not responding.. It still works in 2.3.29.
The second problem is PPP isn't coming up, here's what I see in my log files:
Dec  9 19:17:22 localhost ifup-ppp: pppd started for ppp2 on 		/dev/modem at
115200
Dec  9 19:17:22 localhost pppd[1464]: pppd 2.3.10 started by root, uid 0
Dec  9 19:17:45 localhost pppd[1464]: Serial connection established.
Dec  9 19:17:45 localhost modprobe: can't locate module tty-ldisc-3
Dec  9 19:17:45 localhost pppd[1464]: ioctl(TIOCSETD): Invalid argument(22)
Dec  9 19:17:46 localhost pppd[1464]: Exit.
Dec  9 19:17:46 localhost ifup-ppp: pppd started for ppp2 on /dev/modem at
115200
Dec  9 19:17:46 localhost pppd[1474]: pppd 2.3.10 started by root, uid 0
Dec  9 19:17:54 localhost chat[1482]: Can't restore terminal parameters:
Input/output error

Also, I'm still getting APIC error messages:
Dec  9 19:17:22 localhost kernel: APIC error interrupt on CPU#1, should never
happen.
Dec  9 19:17:22 localhost kernel: ... APIC ESR0: 00000002
Dec  9 19:17:22 localhost kernel: ... APIC ESR1: 00000002
Dec  9 19:17:22 localhost kernel: ... bit 1: APIC Receive CS Error (hw
problem).

I've got an Abit BP6 with a pair of Celeron 400's.. I never get APIC errors
under 2.2 kernels. I get them all the time under 2.3, not sure if it's just a
debugging feature tho. Hope this helps make a better kernel, if you have
questions, lemme know.
