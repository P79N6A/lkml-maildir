Once a long time ago I tried already to do the fixups myself, and got
to the stage of init starting... It wasn't THAT difficult. However
somehow encouraged by the compiler comparisions between gcc and intel's
free compiler, which use the register passing for anything local
to the actual code, where the speed gains are up to 20% im currently
quite inclined to do the redo and finish the experiment.
BTW.> It's not just asm fixpus that have to be done for this
to work. For example all the c files with -fno-omit-frame-pointer
as additional compilatoin flag have to be looked seriously at
again. And of course UML makes the debugging of at least this easier.
