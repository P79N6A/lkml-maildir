More than ridiculous.  Completely agree.
I tried to send 1 patch over the last couple of days.
Unfortunately, it's > 100KB and disappears into the void.
How about 10 patches or so?
What about maintainer sign offs?
Personally, I don't think it's necessary, but for
the subsystem maintainers like you, if or when the
get_maintainers.pl get integrated into patch
generation mechanisms, you might get more emails.
Perhaps more than you want.
Suggestions?
One good thing by emailing all the listed maintainers,
I've gotten several bounces for invalid addresses.
