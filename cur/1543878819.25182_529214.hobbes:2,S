When vm.overcommit_memory = 2 and there appears to be about 2M of memory
readily available and about 12M of memory allocated to pagecache (this
is info gathered from /proc/meminfo) , a call to malloc(5000000) returns
NULL.  I would have expected that somehow, the call to malloc(5000000)
would request the memory in pagecache to be released for use by the app.

Yes.

Shouldn't be, what makes you think this is happening?

Not as far as I know, it's unlikely this would be of any benefit.
