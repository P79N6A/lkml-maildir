vmalloc_to_page() does not work on kmalloc/kmap'd memory.
On many system kmalloc memory is not even represented in the
page tables because the mapping goes through a direct bypass
window.
You need to know where the object came from to convert it
into a page properly.  You should be allocating and passing
around pages internally anyways.
