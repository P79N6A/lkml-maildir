It's had a few incarnations with minor tweaks.  But they each did
provide a limit, an upper bound, on how the user could prioritize it's
task with the scheduler (both nice values and rt priorities).

It's got that slippery slope feeling.  When do you decided that you're
just punting everything to an rlimit and it becomes an unmanaged mess?
However, in this case, at least it's easy to justify cpu time as a
resource.  I'll repost in the AM...sleep calls.
