There is a hook in the kernel immediately after enteing protected mode
for *exactly* this reason -- it was added to support LOADLIN.  The
whole point is that your boot loader obtains control at that point so
you can put things back where they need to go (such as 0x100000 for
the main part of the kernel, which you will *never* get from an
HMA-enabled DOS.)  The algorithm for that is pretty straightforward;
you can even deal with the case where you have scattered pages all
over memory.
