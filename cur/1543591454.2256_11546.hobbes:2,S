First off you have to decide where you want to run your 'get data'.  There
are three context you can pick from: user priority or from the kernel.  If
you run the loop below from a user context then you will have a very
unresponsive system but at least other things will still run.  If you run
that from a kernel context nothing else will run... unless you explicitly
call the scheduler.

You mentioned a timer... it runs in kernel context but at least it
will not end up hanging your system up.  This is how you would use one:
struct tq_struct timer;
init_timer(&timer);
timer.routine = func;
timer.data = something;
mod_timer(&timer, 5*HZ); // 5 seconds from now
void func( unsigned long something ) {
	get_data( something );
	mod_timer(&timer, 5*HZ); // again in 5 seconds
}
Make sure you call 'del_timer_sync' once you are done.

Since you are getting data every 5 seconds you may as well use a user
space program.  It does not seem like you are looking for phenomenal
responsiveness here.
