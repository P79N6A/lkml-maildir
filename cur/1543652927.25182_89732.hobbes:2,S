So what's the vote on this?  It's a decision between clearing only the
obvious bit (BH_Dirty) on the one hand, and keeping the code as
unchanged as possible to reduce the possibility of introducing new
bugs.
But frankly I can't see any convincing argument for clearing anything
except the dirty state in this case.
