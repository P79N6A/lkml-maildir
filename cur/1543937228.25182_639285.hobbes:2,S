Subject: [PATCH] [0/36] Great change_page_attr patch series v3
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Changes to previous versions: 
- Ported to the latest git-x86 including the PAT patchkit
This undoes some changes in the PAT patches and reimplements them
in a different way. End result should be equivalent, but this
made it easier for me to merge the patches.
- Fix NX bit handling (I think even after Jeremy's fixes it was
still not completely right) 
- Minor fixes based on feedback
