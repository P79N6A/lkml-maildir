"hda: FUJITSU MPB3032ATU, 3093MB w/0kB Cache, CHS=785/128/63, UDMA"
my kernel says at boot time.
I have the same problem since years (in 2.0.xx too), but I blindly trust
in 
Linux (the salesman didn't told me that the disk had some cache and he
told my 
that it was UDMA), so I thought that I got a bad hard disk drive (it was
really 
cheap, maybe too much cheap and anyway it works).
But it seems to me that your reply maybe it's a bit too much
"political":
it is in a general and ignorant (I speak for me and not for my employer) 
way there are at least 2 manner for a such result; it is 
1) the drive says buffer size equal 0 and Linux kernel reports it
2) the drive says correctly some buffer size different from 0 and Linux
kernel 
   doesn't understand and shows and use 0.
Why are you completely sure that 2) in such cases is false?
