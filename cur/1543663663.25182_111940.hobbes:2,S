If you are thinking of this it dose look like people was not using it I
know I'm not.It reduces memory for instructions but that is all and
memory is seems is not a problem at least not for instructions. 
It dose not exist in new cpu's from IBM I don't know the official reason
for the removal.
If you really do mean compressed cache I don't think anybody has done
that for real.
