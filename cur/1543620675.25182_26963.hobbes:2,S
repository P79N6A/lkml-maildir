What?
Ok, I changed the 10mbit to 100mbit because this is my LAN speed
here. I first didn't see, that the root handle is per device.
But
tc qdisc add dev $DEV root handle 1: cbq avpkt 1000 bandwidth 10mbit
is exactly the line from your HOWTO. So what will be proper values
for my DSL Line with 128kbit up and 768kbit downstream?
