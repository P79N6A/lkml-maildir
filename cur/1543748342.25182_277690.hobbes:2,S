No, there comes a point where the vm pressure overrides the value of 
swappiness and we start swapping. It is better in 2.6.7 and before with 
issues yet to be resolved in the latest mainline trees. My tree (-ck) has a 
slightly different tuning and a hard maplimit option for just such a reason 
but are unlikely to be of interest to the mainline maintainers so I've never 
promoted them.
