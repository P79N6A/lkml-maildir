Hello...
I`m also in the moment testing with my raid-problem where one drive
falls out of the raid...till now it did not happen with the old driver,
but that means nothing as it only happened once a week or so.
Something other made me wonder:
I ran the machine several times with the *new* aic7xxx-driver (TCQ=32)
and the "aic7xxx=verbose" commandline, and i noticed the following:
At every reboot (made by "reboot", RH7.1), the machine was not able to
stop the raid5 correctly...it un-mounted the mountpoint (/home) and then
it normaly wants to stop the raid...(you see the messages "mdrecoveryd
got waken up...") but that did not work and after some time (30sec) the
kernel Ooopsed. This was reproducable and only occured if booted with
the "aic7xxx=verbose" kernel-parameter.
The effect after reboot was, that the raid had to be resynced because
one partition (that which always falls out) was damaged or at least
seemed to.
(The filesystem was clean, that was already unmounted as the oops
occured.)
Perhaps someone can test if this is reproducable with his machine
too...i use kernel 2.4.3, raid is built-in, also the aic7xxx, there are
three raid-disks (LVD, aic7xxx-controller on Mobo) in a raid5 mounted as
/home.
Solong...
Frank.

Microsoft isn't the answer.
Microsoft is the question, and the answer is NO.
