Not speaking for a major distro, just for me writing HPET (high
performance event timer ...) support for x86-64 (and it happens to exist
on ia64 as well, and possibly might be in new Intel P4 chipsets, too).
It's a very nice piece of hardware that allows very fine granularity
aperiodic interrupts (in each interrupt you set when the next one will
happen), without much overhead.
It'd be a shame to just set this timer to 1kHz periodic just use that as
a base timer, when you can do much better resolution and latency-wise.
HPET has a base clock > 10 MHz.

When HPET becomes a standard (yes, it's a MS requirement for new PCs),
it won't be expensive on i386 anymore.
