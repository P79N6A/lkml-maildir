Which means you also cannot easily keep track of which driver supports
suspend/resume and which doesn't, as there will always be drivers where a
missing suspend/resume function is correct.
Wouldn't it be more sensible to have
    .suspend = suspend_nothing_to_do
instead, and reserve NULL for `not yet implemented'?
