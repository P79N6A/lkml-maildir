I was wrong: what prevents it is that proc_fops isn't used at all in these
paths!  However it is used in proc_get_inode thusly:
                if (de->proc_fops)
                        inode->i_fop = de->proc_fops;
What if proc_fops is set to NULL between these two?  Putting it into a
local variable should take care of this one, but since I'm not sure if
it's really needed I'll leave that to you!
Otherwise, here's a patch that adds memory barriers (maybe these can be
SMP memory barriers) since the atomic ops you are using do not imply
such barriers according to Documentation/atomic_ops.txt.  The memory
barriers are needed, since you need to know that if you saw a non-NULL
proc_fops, then remove_proc_entry saw your increased pde_users count.
If the proc_fops write was re-ordered after the pde_users read, or the
proc_fops read was re-ordered before the pde_users write, then this may
not be true.
Also, I removed the early checks for NULL proc_fops.  True, they avoid
an atomic operation and a memory barrier, however they only avoid them
in the error path, when -EIO is going to be returned, which is hardly a
fast path.  In the common case, they represent a pointless check.
Ciao,
Duncan.
PS: Compiles, but otherwise untested.
