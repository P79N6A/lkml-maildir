I think the big question is whether or not ACPI will exist on Alpha, or
other non-x86 platforms.  Since Athlon and AXP will be sharing
motherboard technology it would not surprise me.
If that is the case, all the direct mem references would need to
eventually be purged from the driver.  If the inline assembler is
required, it should probably ifdef'd CONFIG_X86 in a header somewhere if
nothing else.
As an aside, USB is _already_ on AXP, so inline assembler and other
x86-isms in the USB code needs to be examined and compartmentalized, or
purged...
