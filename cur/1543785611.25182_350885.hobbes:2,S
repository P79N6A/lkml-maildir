They are devices - class devices :). I have the following distinction
in my head - "normal" devices (bus devices) are real hardware devices
and their drivers need to do resource and/or power management. Class
devices represent virtual devices - some kind of abstraction - that
unify and combine "real" devices from several buses into one class.
And of course nothing shoudl stop us from building class devices on
top of other class devices, if needed.
Anyway, I think if Greg gives up and agrees on nesting classes all of
it can go in -mm for now and I will contact other maintainers to
verify that changes work. IIRC video/dvb mainatiners prefered all
changes to go through them.
In any case I don't expect it reach Linus until after 2.6.14 released
- do you agree?
