It is not a function of the bootloader, this is irrelevent.
Also, I believe that the original posters message was an April Fool's
joke (was posted on the 1st April to the linux-arm lists).
However, the problem it describes is not, and I do have a fix in my
tree, but the delta between my last patch and my current tree is one
line, which hardly seems worth putting out a new ARM patch.
