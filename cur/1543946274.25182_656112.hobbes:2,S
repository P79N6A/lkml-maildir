Without having any opinion here or understanding what the problem is, I just
want to remind everyone that ISDN in the linux kernel (isdn4linux) is not

There are drivers for common devices/interfaces, the CAPI interface and of
course hardware drivers for other ISDN cards like the active ones as well.
