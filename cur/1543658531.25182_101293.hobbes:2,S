I am partial to HTML Tidy for a few reasons:
1) cross-platform, reentrant C library
2) very forgiving of sloppy, malformed markup
3) produces clean markup - XHTML if requested
4) C++, Perl, Pascal, COM and .NET bindings available,
    others easily done with SWIG
But I must admit, as one of the primary developers, I am probably 
biased.  But if you need to get your markup cleaned up so that you can 
apply XML tools to it, it is probably the best game in town.

take it easy,
Charlie
