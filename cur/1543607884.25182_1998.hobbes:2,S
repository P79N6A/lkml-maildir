Ahh, are you a new convert from a 2.2 kernel?
In 2.4 the kernel will swap out much earlier to make room for the running
programs, and disk cache.  This is normal.
Earlier 2.4 kernels didn't do so well, but I won't go into detail because
there is already enough about that in the archives...
When you watch vmstat, if you see a lot of swapping traffic without much
good reason, then you should probably report something...
