You should have CCed Andrew originally.
All objections I've seen so far have been vague, from folks that
don't/or refuse to understand the fundamentals of how this patch
works nor has tracked the development of it carefully. Until
specific questions and objections are articulated, nothing can be
addressed at this time. I'm biased to ignoring all talk until
then.
