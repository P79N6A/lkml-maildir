I have been testing interactivity now for for a while.  The only
symptom (subjective) that I can see is occasional but repeatable
(if you get what I mean) video _only_ skips in xine.  The audio
does not skip.  The video skips are very short, only a 4-5 frames
at most.
They occur _only_ when performing such operations as rendering a 
large bitmap to the screen.  They do _not_ occur when dragging
windows (with contents visible during drag,) nor does CPU load
seem to have an effect.
Playing games with nice/renice on xine or on other processes,
especially GIMP etc., does not seem to have an effect.  
From this it seems to my limited view that the remaining skips
might be XFree86 issues?
Some pertinent details:
2 x P4 Xeon 2.4 Mhz, 512Mb ram.
Radeon VQ + Matrox Mystique.
Premptive kernel
Hyperthreading enabled.
IDE DVD, no SCSI in system.
No problems at all, only minor niggles since 2.5.67.  (I have
been following -mm patches.)
Thanks for the wonderful work!
