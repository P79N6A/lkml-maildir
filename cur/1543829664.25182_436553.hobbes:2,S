There are valid places in the kernel where the allocated size is
different from the type's one. That's why I added the
memleak_padding().

OK, I'll try to add the infrastructure for type ids but default to
sizeof initially.

There are two leaks reported in ACPI but I only posted a patch for one
as I didn't have time to track the other (a reference count doesn't
get to zero and the structure not freed).
There is another leak in legacy_init_iomem_resources() in
arch/i386/setup.c (request_resource() fails but the memory is not
freed - see the attached patch). I initially marked this as a false
positive but it wasn't (I have to revisit the false positives).
