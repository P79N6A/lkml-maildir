Seconded (thirded?), this is a very good idea (and as it's just a queue
flush is probably quite easy to do).
That way those of us who are paranoid can upgrade our experimental boxes
immediately, apply the latest -stable to the non-experimental boxes, and
then cautiously upgrade those boxes when the experimental ones seem to
be working OK. Currently whenever there's a non-stable kernel rev I'm
filled with trepidation: do I upgrade the stable boxes and risk
instability, or leave them as they are and risk insecurity?
