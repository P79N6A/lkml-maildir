Thats good. So we have atleast one way of detecting the "closed fd without
deregistering" within taskstats itself.

As far as API is concerned, even a taskstats listener is not being
prevented from opening multiple sockets. As Andrew also pointed out,
everything needs to be done per-socket.

That was the design earlier. In the past week, the design has changed to
one where there are still many listeners in user space but messages
get unicast to each of them. Earlier listeners would get messages generated
on task exit from every cpu, now they get it only from cpus for which
they have explicitly registered interest (via a cpumask passed in through
another genetlink command).

Yes. When the listener registers interest in a set of cpus, as described
above, its (genl_info->pid) is being stored in the per-cpu list of
listeners for those cpus. When a task exits on one of those cpus, the
exit data is only sent via genetlink_unicast to those pids
(really, nl_pids) who are on that cpu's listener list.
Now that I think more about it, netlink is really maintaining a pidhash
of nl_pids, not process pids, right ? So if one userapp were to open
multiple sockets using NETLINK_GENERIC protocol (regardless of how many
of those are for the taskstats), each of them would have to use a
different nl_pid. Hence, it would be valid for the taskstats layer to use 
netlink_lookup() at any time to see if the corresponding socket were
closed ?
