64Mb (effective usable size) is HUGE. sure. but you share it
with all other vmalloc users. I agree with Pete that kmalloc is the
superior solution; I mentioned vmalloc to him before because that would
have been the minimal fix; Pete decided to fix it for real... 
(also vmalloc is also rather slow for hotpaths due to tlb effects)
