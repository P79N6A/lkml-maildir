Ok, either way removal of LSM isn't an issue in that case.

My concerns with low water mark were noted in
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-security-module&m=113232319627338&w=2

I also pointed out examples of how low water mark has
compatibility/useability problems of its own in that discussion.  And it
has only has the two options available to all such "simple" models when
reality conflicts with their model:  preserve the model and break the
functionality or make the process a trusted subject fully capable of
violating the model (at which point you are only pretending to enforce
the model).  Versus being able to configure the policy to match reality,
as in SELinux.

If such models can demonstrate their viability, then you can ultimately
submit a patch to extend SELinux/Flask to support them - I have no
problem with that (again, if they can be shown to be viable and
implementation is correct).  But first you have to show that.  In the
meantime, your work can be done via a kernel patch that you carry; it
doesn't justify keeping LSM in mainline.  Note too that LSM seems to me
to be harmful to such work, because many of the mistakes you made in the
first place might have been avoided if you had started by extending the
existing SELinux/Flask infrastructure (which had much more defined
semantics) than using LSM (which is just a skeletal framework with no
real semantics).  Plus it might have encouraged you to propose each
change as a small patch to SELinux along the way and gotten you valuable
feedback sooner.
