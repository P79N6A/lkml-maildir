We do have limits to avoid memory getting too full.

The common solution is to have a reserve (min_free_kbytes). The problem 
with the network stack seems to be that the amount of reserve needed 
cannot be predicted accurately.
The solution may be as simple as configuring the reserves right and 
avoid the unbounded memory allocations. That is possible if one 
would make sure that the network layer triggers reclaim once in a 
while.
