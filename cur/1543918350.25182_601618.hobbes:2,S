Yes, there are such cases.
If tasks are running in a cpuset, and someone changes the
'cpus' of that cpuset, the tasks already in that cpuset don't
move.  They stay with their task structs cpus_allowed pointing
to the old value.  The only code path that user space can trigger
that leads to changing an existing tasks cpus_allowed mask is to
write that tasks pid to a cpuset 'tasks' file.
So after changing the 'cpus' of a cpuset, you (something in
user space) then has to rewrite every pid in that cpusets
tasks file back to that same tasks file, in order to get the
change to be applied to each of those tasks, and get them to
start running on their new CPUs.
