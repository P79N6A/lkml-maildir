We've got many flavors of the patch discussed in this thread, so this
needs a little qualification.  When get_request_wait_wakeup wakes one of
the waiters (as in the patch I sent yesterday), you want to make sure
that after you wake the first waiter there is a request available for
the proccess he is going to wake up, and so on for each other waiter.  
I did a quick test of this yesterday, and under the 20 proc iozone test,
turning off batch_requests more than doubled the number of context
switches hit during the run, I'm assuming this was from wakeups that
failed to find requests.
I'm doing a few tests with Andrea's new get_request_wait_wakeup ideas
and wake_up_nr.
