Subject: [PATCH][BUGFIX] : Another Megaraid patch for 2.6 (please apply)

Hi all,
This bug was discussed on linux-scsi a few weeks back, but it appears to
have slipped through the cracks. This fix was originally proposed by
Christoph Hellwig, but I am reposting it, since I have the hardware :-)
Anyway, the problem that this fixes is that megaraid doesn't set the
moduler owner for the host_template, this means that the module can be
removed, even when it is in use.
Cheers,
Paul
