Ugh, I'd rather not if we don't have to.
It seems like you could get this behaviour from issuing a poll/select 
(really?)/epoll as one of the async calls to complete.  (And you  
mention this in a later email? :))
Part of my thinking on this is that we might want it to be really  
trivial to create and wait on groups of ops.. maybe as a context.   
One of the things posix AIO wants is the notion of submitting and  
waiting on a group of ops as a "list".  That sounds like we might be  
able to implement it by issuing ops against a context, created as  
part of the submission, and then waiting for it to drain.
Being able to wait on that with file->poll() obviously requires  
juggling file-> associations which sounds like more weight than we  
might want.  Or it'd be optional and we'd get more moving parts and  
divergent paths to test.
So, sure, it's possible and not terribly difficult, but I'd rather  
avoid it if people can be convinced to get the same behaviour by  
issuing an async instance of their favourite readiness syscall.
