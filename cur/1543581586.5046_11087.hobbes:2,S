I want to use this for embedded systems. For example, last weekend I was
on a bus where the advertising screen at the front went through a
complete (uncustomised) Windows 2000 boot. I want to do better than
that, and build an application specific splash screen early into the
boot process, with the detailed messages coming out through the serial
port.
