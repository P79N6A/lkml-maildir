hmm, okay I'll try ...
linux-vserver is a combination of kernel patch and
userspace tools to create 'virtual servers' similar
to UML, but sharing the resources (and kernel).
to do this, it uses process isolation, network
isolation and disk space separation (tagging). 
in addition it does resource management (accounting
and limits) for various aspects (CPU, memory, 
processes, sockets, filehandles, ...)
the jail module is recreating a limited subset of
the isolation aspect via LSM (similar to the BSD
jail) which allows to confine a process (and it's
children) to a chroot() environment under certain
limitations (resources)
best,
Herbert
