The whole system...  If I can not get a webpage on my workstation I  try
to connect to my router using ssh but the xterm close  immeiately  which
mean, the system is entirely crashed
Then if I use my KVM switch onthe router, the screen is black, and as  I
have already written, no kernel messages from the crash in the logs.
If there is an option I can activate to get logs dumps or  such,  please
let me know.
Note:   Currently I retry to get my broken develstation running  again
        and then I can try to compile new kernels, but this takes time
        currently...  (no money for parts, since it is an SCSI system)
Thanks, Greetings and nice Day/Evening
