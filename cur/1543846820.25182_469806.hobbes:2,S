I think you lack of LOWMEM, since you use a 32bits kernel.
Could you post here the result of these commands when your system is using 
more than 100.000 connections (and before the OOM :) )
cat /proc/meminfo
cat /proc/slabinfo
cat /proc/net/sockstat
cat /proc/net/stat/rt_cache
cat /proc/buddyinfo
grep . /proc/sys/net/ipv4/*
grep . /proc/sys/net/ipv4/route/*
