a) sftp is path based protocol, there's no separate lookup
b) sftp doesn't transfer st_ino or st_dev, they are both made up on
the client side

That is fine.  It's clearly a superior sulution when the info is
available.  With sshfs the server simply doesn't care about mounts,
and so this is basically out of the question.
