I needed to move that notify_change out of the loop, to fix the truncation
problem, but had great difficulty understanding the loop.  So, just as you
say, made the code cleanup first in 3/4, then fixed the problem in 4/4.
But that cleanup does need your review and testing.

Exactly.  The familiar "fsx foo -q -c 100 -l 10000000" on its own is
enough to trigger it, though my habit is to run that while forcing
swapout and swapoff too.  The problem isn't peculiar to tmpfs,
but I expect other filesystems are more likely just to fail the
fsx test rather than oops.

Any kernel without the unionfs 4/4 should show the problem, but
differently with different sets of patches.  A lot of my testing
was with an earlier set of tmpfs patches for unionfs (I didn't
realize the tmpfs 5/9 issue until later on), and with those it
manifested as fsx failure.
But if you run without any of these patches,
I believe it manifests as shmem_writepage's
		BUG_ON(!(info->flags & SHMEM_TRUNCATE));
or its
		BUG_ON(!entry);
Whereas in tmpfs 4/9 I removed that latter BUG_ON(!entry) -
we don't usually bother to BUG on NULL pointers, just let the
dereference oops.
