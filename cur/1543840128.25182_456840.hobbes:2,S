So what you are saying is that after the move to a new box and a new 
mobo a sector has gone bad on that raid slice? Weird, as I was very 
careful this those drives when I moved them.
I mean, the raid controller is the same, the cpus are the same, just 
more of them, the pci-x bus the same so I didn't expect any problems at 
all.
I was also under the impression that SATA raid controllers work like 
SCSI raid controllers in the way that if a bad sector is encountered the 
controller moves what it can and the mark the sector as bad. I might be 
very wrong about that, though.
However, if I have a bad sector I would like to have that one marked as 
bad so the kernel never tries to read it again. Any suggestions how I do 
that. I assume I have to boot something like Knoppix as sda is my system 
disk.
Regards,
Johan
