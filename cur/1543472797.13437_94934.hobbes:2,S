What would be wrong with a program named repeat ?
echo -n "echo this " | repeat 
Or 
echo -n "echo this" > file
while true
do
cat file
done
Why aren't expr, eval, sed, tr etc not implemented as
devices ?
I am sure it would be fun to implement something like
this as a starter to learn something about the kernel,
but I don't think it should be more than that.
