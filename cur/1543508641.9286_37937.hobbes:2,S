I think I read the whole thread. At least on the archive aerver, it never
mentioned 2.2 or 2.3 until I brought it up.
I was also aware of the earlier RAID thread which was clearly about 2.2.
Actually, Alan included the new RAID code and Linus rejected it.

Production systems already have the drivers they need. If they didn't,
they couldn't be running in production, could they?

Obviously, more testing would help, but how to get more people to test?
Also, it is clearly not the _only_ way to get better stability, as I have
suggested another way.
