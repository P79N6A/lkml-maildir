It fits into suspend-to-disk as a disk-writing mechanism. But most
tricks of suspend-to-disk will be no longer necessary in kexec based
hibernation.

The devices should be put quiescent state to stop DMA like things. But
they do not need to be put in low power state.
"Do not put devices into low power state" vs. "power on devices during
boot-up"
Which one is easier?
