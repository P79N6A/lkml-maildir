Process context.

Yup.

Not really.  Bits 8-19 of preempt_count() count the IRQ depth and bits 0..7
count the inc_preempt_count() depth.  If CONFIG_PREEMPT is enabled,
spin_lock() does inc_preempt_count().  See the definitions of
hardirq_count(), softirq_count() and irq_count().

umm, look at the implementation of schedule_work()?
	if (!test_and_set_bit(0, &work->pending)) {
it's already pending (the scheduled work has not run yet).  You need to
design you schedule_work() caller to queue things up and you need to design
your schedule_work() handler to consume all the thus-far-queued work items.
Just ignore the return value of schedule_work().
