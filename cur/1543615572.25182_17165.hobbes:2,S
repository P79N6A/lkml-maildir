That was the case. I said that it didn't had the board. But I planned to
get one that Riel has on his test (iirc) machine to test the patch. Now you
have fixed it, thanks.
I'll take a look at your patch and see if with your changes the
scsi_assign_lock patch that probably will appear in pre8 is still needed
for the advansys driver.
