thanks - this is a serious showstopper for the ticket spinlock patch. 
( which has otherwise been performing very well in x86.git so far - it 
  has passed a few thousand bootup tests on 64-bit and 32-bit as well, 
  so we are close to it being in a mergable state. Would be a pity to
  lose it due to the 256 cpus limit. )
