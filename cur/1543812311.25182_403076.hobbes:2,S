All right, i'll repost in a minute..

True, but i can't submit those as long as i use tomtom specific cpu-type 
registers (see reply to other post later today).

Hmm, i disagree.. The term (mdiv+8) is multiplied by 2 for s3c2412, this 
is not the case for s3c2410..
I changed it to use the 64 bit arithmetic like s3c2410_get_pll and 
you'll notice the difference is this line:
+       fvco = (uint64_t)baseclk * ((mdiv + 8)<<1);
Maybe it is better to use one get_pll and add an extra parameter to 
indicate the multiplication of (mdiv+8) ?

Done.

Ok, cleaned that up..

Ok, cleaned that up a bit too.. As for the core-ID remark, i will try 
and have a look at it today, but as it is my last day at this firm today 
i can't make any guarantees. Maybe Dimitry Andric will pick this up when 
i'm gone..
Best,
Koen
