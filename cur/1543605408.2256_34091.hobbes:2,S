Hi,
On my machine HDD is slow with all ac-kernels I've tried so far.
There is even more simple test -- hdparm.
2.4.12-ac3:
# hdparm -tT /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  0.70 seconds =182.86 MB/sec
Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  2.88 seconds = 22.22 MB/sec
2.4.13-pre3:
# hdparm -tT /dev/hda
/dev/hda
Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  0.63 seconds =203.00 MB/sec
Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  1.57 seconds = 40.76 MB/sec
Same config options in both kernels. Same hardware.
# hdparm /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
multcount    = 16 (on)
I/O support  =  1 (32-bit)
unmaskirq    =  1 (on)
using_dma    =  1 (on)
keepsettings =  1 (on)
nowerr       =  0 (off)
readonly     =  0 (off)
readahead    =  8 (on)
geometry     = 4865/255/63, sectors = 78165360, start = 0
This is on Athlon-1.4Ghz, chipset amd761/via8231, 
IDE Seagate Barracuda ATA-IV ST340016A 40G.
Can somebody explain such results?
