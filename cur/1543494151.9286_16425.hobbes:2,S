Greetings.
Since I was one of the people who'd reported problems with the 2.2.x kernels
talking to MS-Windows NT 4.0 clients, I'm very happy to confirm that the new
2.2.7 kernel no longer has that problem in our case. We're now seeing
equivalent performance to 2.0.36 for serving up large files and better
performance than 2.0.36 for small files with our product.
My compliments to the people responsible for the fix.
//Mark
