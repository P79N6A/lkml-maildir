ah! I suspected something like this, that's why i looked at the source,
but i didnt check dependent libs ...

yes, very definitely broken. For one, it does not provide predictable
timing - 1000 loops of sched_yield() can be very different on different
CPUs. But the main problem is that on 2.6 sched_yield() is much more
agressive. Something like this was fixed in OpenOffice earlier this
year, and it improved interactivity quite visibly. Could you remove the
sched_yield() and replace it with a 20 msec nanosleep (and keep the rety
loop to 100)? Does that make any difference?
