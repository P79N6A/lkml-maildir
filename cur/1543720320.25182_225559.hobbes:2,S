The openssl library seems to have a strange love for getpid() too. At
least, my old-ish version "openssl-0.9.6b-35.7" does.
My strace logs show over 50 consecutive getpid() calls during the
processing of the SSL_accept() routine. (I'm adding SSL support to vsftpd;
SSL_accept() is called every client connect and also to accept passive
data connections).
Cheers
Chris
