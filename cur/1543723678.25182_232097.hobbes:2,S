Not without more changes, because pd->bdev is only non-NULL when the
device is actually opened by someone. When the device is setup (ie
mapped to a real device) but not opened, pd->bdev (a struct
block_device *) is NULL and pd->dev (a dev_t) is the only thing that
keeps track of the mapping between the packet device and the real
device.
Maybe that's a bad design though. Perhaps pd->dev can be eliminated
altogether.
But anyway, if __bdevname() leaks a module reference it should get
fixed, right?
