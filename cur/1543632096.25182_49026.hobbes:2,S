Dear Gerald please look closer. The hdparm -i is executing the
drive id command directly and does *not* rely on the internally
permanently dragged around id structure. So the change I did
is entierly fine. Just go ahead and check whatever hdparm -i /dev/hdx
reports the proper thing after changing some dma setting.
It does - I did check it :-).
BTW> The next thing to be gone is simple the fact that we drag
around the id information permanently, where infact only
some capabilitie fields are sucked out of it and the
device identification string is only needed for reporting
during boot-up.
