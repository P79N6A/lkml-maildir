What kind of PCI device do you have? I had this problem once with
an PCI-Matchmaker[1] based board (for which we still have the wrong
PCI-ID btw, but my patch was rejected twice...).

With 2.2 I also had this without APIC. 
I have been flooded with interrupts which have been intended for
the Cyclone card (3c905B 100BaseTX), and exited the ISR quickly
after querying the interrupt register of my Matchmaker board
without any ACKing, but the Cyclone never got these interrupts
anymore.
But is doesn't seem to be a 3c905 based problem, as I have 
 11:   95772726          XT-PIC  es1371, eth0, eth1
in /proc/interrupts where eth0 and eth1 are both Cyclones.
Even the vga card has IRQ 11 assigned.
So this is not really unknown ;-)
