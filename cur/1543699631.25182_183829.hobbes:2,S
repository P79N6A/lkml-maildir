Ah.
Truncate doesn't look at the contents of the file, it just frees the space 
regardless of what the data was.  (It doesn't have to load the contents of 
the blocks into memory and look at them in order to make the file's length 
shorter in the metadata and de-allocate those blocks.)
What was suggested a bit earlier was automatically looking at the contents of 
the data being written to disk, and not allocating actual blocks if the data 
is all zeroes.  (A bit like looking at pages of memory and copy-on-write 
aliasing them to the zero page whenever the page is entirely zeroes.)
Truncate doesn't do any of that.  Truncate only plays with metadata, and 
doesn't care about the contents of the file.
