KERN_ALERT is two steps higher in priority (lower number) than
KERN_ERR.  Why on earth would we see KERN_ERR messages but not
KERN_ALERT messages?
In fact die() should probably be using KERN_EMERG.
Messages without a loglevel are by default logged at KERN_WARNING
level, one step lower in priority than KERN_ERR.
This all sounds to me like there is something wacky going on
somewhere, and we need to get to the bottom of it rather than just
remove printk tags.
Paul.
