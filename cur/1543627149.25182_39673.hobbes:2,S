Have you tried to change MPS mode to 1.1 from 1.4 (I see addres message timeouts
in your log)?

My VP6 died on me recently with some funny symptoms:
it hangs in X when I start netscape and move mouse, or if I do
bk clone on kernel tree, it dies with
kernel BUG at /usr/src/linux-2.4.18/include/asm/smplock.h:62!
BUG in various places pretty soon.
(this BUG is only appears if 2 CPUs are present in motherboard).
So if your troubles began only recently, you might want to try another
motherboard just to be sure.
Bye,
