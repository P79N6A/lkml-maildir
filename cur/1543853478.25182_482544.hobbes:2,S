I confirm a got this one too.
On a working kernel on an Opteron, we have normally 4 directories 
in /dev/oprofile :
# ls -ld /dev/oprofile/?
drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 0 15. Nov 12:38 /dev/oprofile/0
drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 0 15. Nov 12:38 /dev/oprofile/1
drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 0 15. Nov 12:38 /dev/oprofile/2
drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 0 15. Nov 12:38 /dev/oprofile/3
With linux-2.6.19-rc5, the first one (0) is missing and we get 1,2,3
Maybe the 'bug' is in oprofile tools, that currently expect to find '0'
