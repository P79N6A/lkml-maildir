Should the git daemon take a look at objects/info/alternates to check
that if it exists, it
points to a repository that also has a "git-daemon-export-ok" file?  
I don't see that this
could be used for anything nasty, but it does provide a loophole where
the daemon may
open files outside the initial repository ... so a sanity check seems in order.
