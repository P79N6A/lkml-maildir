Hmm... Isn't it somewhat big change for them?
Do you mean that they can add a text file at root containing 
the command-line?
It is not so good... Since currently many scripts looks at 
/proc/cmdline and get the arguments they are interested in... 
The initramfs will not allow this... And there is no access to 
initramfs files after control is passed to root, since most 
distributions erase its contents in order to free memory...

Thanks!!!
But why not making it a configuration option?
For example, I think it should be at least 1024...
Will this patch update the document?
If it does please don't specify maximum size,
The boot loader should be instructed to put unlimited 
string... OK... there is no thing like unlimited, so max 16K :)
Only the kernel should truncate it to the right size.
