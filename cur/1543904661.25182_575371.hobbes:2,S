I did two major changes when upgrading from 22-rc6-mm1 to 23-rc1-mm1.
I switched from DISCONTIGMEM to SPARSEMEM and from SLAB to SLUB.
The other combinations:
SPARSEMEM+SLAB:
[    0.000000] early_node_map[4] active PFN ranges
[    0.000000]     0:        0 ->      159
[    0.000000]     0:      256 ->   524288
[    0.000000]     1:   524288 ->   917488
[    0.000000]     1:  1048576 ->  1179648
PANIC: early exception rip ffffffff807c4ac5 error 2 cr2 ffffe20003000010
[    0.000000]
[    0.000000] Call Trace:
DISCONTIGMEM+SLUB:
[   39.833272] ..MP-BIOS bug: 8254 timer not connected to IO-APIC
[   40.016659] Kernel panic - not syncing: IO-APIC + timer doesn't
work! Try using the 'noapic' kernel parameter
DISCONTIGMEM+SLAB:
Boots until it can't find / because I didn't append the correct initrd
It also hit the MP-BIOS bug, but was not bothered by it:
[   36.696965] ..MP-BIOS bug: 8254 timer not connected to IO-APIC
[   36.880537] Using local APIC timer interrupts.
[   36.932215] result 12500283
[   36.940581] Detected 12.500 MHz APIC timer.
So I think, I will postpone SPARSEMEM until -mm2, as there are seem to
be some problems in that area (Re: 2.6.23-rc1-mm1 sparsemem_vmemamp
fix)
But maybee I will get SLUB to work. ;)
