Banks run their databases on real iron. Machines with downtimes in the
realm of seconds per year. Where you can upgrade your OS, Kernel,
hardware and almost everything else while running. No bank runs a
database on Microsoft software. Machines you can fire bullets at and
they continue to run.

So what? These are ATM machines. If they're down, you don't lose
money.  If your database server is down, you do.
