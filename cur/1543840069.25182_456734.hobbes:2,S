Subject: [PATCH] Remove redundant up() in stop_machine(2.6.18-rc4)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/8/23/118

 An up() is called in kernel/stop_machine.c on failure, and also in
the caller unconditionally. I have reported, but now it is still here.
