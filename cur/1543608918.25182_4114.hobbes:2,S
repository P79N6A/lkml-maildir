HI!
I noticed with great happiness that the via timer bugfix had made it into linus'
version of the kernel as of 2.4.10.
but it seems that the patch was incomplete: The bug is still triggered on my
computer using 2.4.14, but the bugfix seems to work whith -ac kernels.
now I diffed the ac-version of that file whith the current version of linus'
kernel:
# diff -u arch/i386/kernel/time.c ../linux-2.4.10-ac12/arch/i386/kernel/time.c

                spin_unlock(&i8253_lock);
 
                count = ((LATCH-1) - count) * TICK_SIZE;
you can see what's missing to actually work around the via timer bug. I hope
this will go into 2.4.15.
