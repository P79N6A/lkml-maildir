Which is why the functionality is still there.

Please respond to the technical explanation I provided, and stop
referring to the functionality ** which is still there and works **
as being disabled.
The fact that PCI exposes a mechanism that conflicts with that is
a separate issue.
Whining does not help.
I can't help it if that schedule.txt patch took until 2.6.19 to get
upstream; ISTR it was available before 2.6.18 shipped.  Maybe patches
to that file should be accelerated, even into the stable series.

So I'm amused that the problem you refer to is the direct consequence
of Linus' patch to add the suspend_late()/resume_early() mechanism
into the PCI driver framework.  (Again, see the technical explanation;
and please try to have a technical discussion, not a flamefest.)
One of the missing steps in Linus' formulation there is that not all
interfaces are equivalent in terms of support guarantee.  Bugs are
interfaces, for example, and sometimes folk wrongly depend on them
when they persist for a long time (like, cough, this one).
His comment was specifically about breaking a widely used API that
many people have been relying on since, oh, about 1996, and had been
well proven in that time.  And the change was a "system doesn't work"
level change.
In contrast, the /sys/devices/.../power/state API has never had many
users beyond developers trying to test their drivers (without taking
the whole system into a low power state, which probably didn't work
in any case), and has *always* been problematic.  And the change you
object to doesn't "break" anything fundamental, either.  Everything
still works.
In terms of any reasonable expectations about support, those two
changes aren't comparable.
