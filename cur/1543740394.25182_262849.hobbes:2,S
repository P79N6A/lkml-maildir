Actually you need to have another kind of semaphore based on a new kind of
wait-queue: Priority based. I.e. the task with the highest priority get
woken up first. Then on top of that you build your mutex.
I was planning to start to look at it and try to see if I could get
anything to work, but I must admit I haven't got much further than
just getting Igno's -U8.1 up running.
An idea I had was to make a macro in list.h called
 list_insert_sorted(list, element, condition_statement)
and use that in this kind of wait_queue...
To get a mutex with priority inheritance add an element pointing to the
current owner and a field where you store the owners original priority
which it has to be set back to when it relases the mutex (I am not sure
how this will work out if someone holds several mutexes!)
