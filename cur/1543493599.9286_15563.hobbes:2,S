472 + 37 == 509.  Except the "ps aux | wc" counts as two processes, the
./fork is only one, so you only had 508 during the first test.
MIN_TASKS_LEFT_FOR_ROOT defaults to 4, and the NR_TASKS upper limit
defaults to 512.  
508 + 4 = 512.
tasks_I_had_running + tasks_left_for_root = max_nr_tasks.
Everything adds up: this is expected behaviour if you don't increase
NR_TASKS.  You can increase NR_TASKS in include/linux/tasks.h (but not
too much: I think you hit LDT limits above about 4090, though Ingo has a
patch to remove that limit).
