I've personally always had a preference for ObjC
over the bloat of C++. Beautiful simplicity that
barely touches the C syntax (in fact can be done
as little more than macros) and if well written
gives clean understandable code without a lot
of hidden overhead. 
However I don't think I'd use inheritance on
a scheduler object other than for academic
papers :-)
There are times to KISS...
