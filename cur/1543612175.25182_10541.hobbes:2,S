Well. You're really easy may do this only in such dumb test example
then you do something real between mmaps even memory allocation in
multi threaded program you will not able to track it.

Well but it's not really easy and right thing to do as you will also
need to write your own memory allocator (as standard one uses mmap so
you can get in recursive loop).  And also it will be really
platform/kernel dependent as different kernels may use different
addresses there user part of address space available for mmaping
starts.

Yes. I'm quite agree with that.  Also if you have one tree implemented
it should not be too hard to have a second tree indexed by other
field.

I understand it but does it start so search standard way from the low
addresses or it looks it above the hint address before looking at
lower addresses ?
