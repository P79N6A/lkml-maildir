Also note that the current code *should* "gracefully" handle the failure.
In that, it will not reclaim the page on a write error, so it isn't going
to cause a data loss...
It's just that it currently results in unswappable pages.
Handling it more gracefully by allowing the page to be retried with another
swap entry is OK I guess, but given the added complexity, I'm not even sure
it is worthwhile.
Perhaps we should just do the ClearPageError in the try_to_unuse path,
because the sysadmin should take down that swap device on failure. So if a
new device is added, we want to be able to unpin the failed pages.
