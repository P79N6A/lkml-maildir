That u64 needs to become a dma_addr_t.  That means that
ib_dma_mapping_ops.alloc_coherent() and ib_dma_mapping_ops.free_coherent() are
wrong as well.

I'd have picked this up if it had been in git-infiniband for even a couple
of days.  I'm assuming this all got slammed into mainline because of the
merge window thing.
I cannot find these patches on the kernel mailing list.  I cannot find the
pull request anywhere.

no, dma_map_single() returns a dma_addr_t.
