It does, but once it gets the file list down to the size
where it finds that a fair number of the pages were
referenced, it will back off the pressure automatically.
Also, we do not apply the used-once algorithm to mapped
pages, meaning that mapped pages with the accessed bit
set always get rotated back onto the active list, while
unmapped pages do not.

It will be hard to merge that "on its own" without the
split queues.  I can't really think of a good way to
split this patch up into multiple functional bits...
