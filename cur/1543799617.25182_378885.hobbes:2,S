Hello,
Sorry in advance if this has already been asked. Anyway:
1. Would it be possible for the IPv6 REJECT netfilter module to be 
backported to 2.4?
2. Apparently the quota_v2 module in 2.4 still lacks the licence macro 
and taints the kernel, even though the same module in 2.6 is correctly 
tagged as GPL. Any chance of seeing this corrected? In case it makes 
things any easier, I am enclosing an appropriate patch.
Merry Christmas, everyone!
