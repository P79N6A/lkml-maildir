Well, so write a different governor, and feel free to use Venkatesh's code
as a base [it's GPLed, after all...]. I prefer to have several different 
governors available, so that different users with different needs
can use different "policies".

They can't -- If the driver for Transmeta CPUs is loaded, 
cpufreq governors cannot be started.

Such a "tweaking by sysfs" patch can be added later.
