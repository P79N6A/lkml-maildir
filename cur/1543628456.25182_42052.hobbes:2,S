Well, load balancing or bridging is an option, but not the one I
want... I will use the first nic as "normal" (firewalled, traffic
shaped, ...) interface for my customer's websites, and eth1 as the
"backup" and maintenance nic in case something goes wrong ...
I don't understand why it should be illegal to have to nics on the
same server on the same subnet ...
Regarding static arps: am I correct these should be added to all
machines on the subnet and to the router? (That last is not possible,
I don't have permission to change stuff on the router)
