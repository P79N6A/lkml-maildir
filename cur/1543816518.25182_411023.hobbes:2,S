Hello,
I completely agree with rules 1, 2 and 5. However, IMHO rule 4 should 
just be the inverse of rule 5: The stuff in include/linux should always 
be independent from KABI (and userspace of course). Simply because the 
way we _implement_ things in the kernel has to be different from the 
things that we _specify_ in the kernel ABI. They just append to be both 
written in C language, but it's not a reason to mix them. The kernel 
developers has to be free of doing any kludge, clever things, 
compatibility workarounds without affecting the userspace applications. 
Otherwise, you'll end up with another include/linux after few months! 
Separating the implementation and the binary specification has the 
additional advantage that if some kernel hacker mistakenly change the 
ABI, it's easy to say : "see, after your commit xxxxxxxx, the linux 
header and the kabi header are semantically different. You did something 
Wrong".
As for rule 3, if you have independent headers, this should be much less 
necessary. Additionally, keeping all the names identical to what they 
are already called will allow userspace to just use include/kabi/ as the 
/usr/include/linux/ directory. Avoiding smelly things like:
linux/foo.h:
   #define __kabi_foo foo
   #include <kabi/foo.h>
That was my 2 cents :-)
Regards,
Eric
