Now that you mention this, I believe that there were som fixes to the ext2/3
code to not overflow some calcs, but I don't recall the specifics.  It sure
seems unusual to have such easy-to-reproduce errors.

Do you expect to have so many small files in this huge filesystem?
Basically, the "-i" parameter is telling mke2fs what you think the
average file size will be, so 4kB is very small.
Cheers, Andreas
