hmm, thanks.
I'm not sure that volanomark is very representative of any real-world
thing.

Could we please see test5 versus test5 plus Andrew's patch?
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.0-test4/2.6.0-test4-mm6/broken-out/sched-CAN_MIGRATE_TASK-fix.patch
and if you have time, also test5 plus sched-CAN_MIGRATE_TASK-fix.patch plus
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.0-test4/2.6.0-test4-mm6/broken-out/sched-balance-fix-2.6.0-test3-mm3-A0.patch
What I'm afraid of is that those patches will yield improved results over
test5, and that adding
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.0-test4/2.6.0-test4-mm6/broken-out/sched-2.6.0-test2-mm2-A3.patch
will slow things down again.
