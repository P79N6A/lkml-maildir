Hi,
is it intentional that
echo foo >/dev/hda1
doesn't update the mtime of the device node, but
echo foo >/dev/tty10
does update the mtime of the device node?
And no, mounting with the noatime flag doesn't help because the
mtime is updated. IIRC some time ago this behaviour was different,
but I could easily be mistaken.
Regards,
Carl-Daniel
