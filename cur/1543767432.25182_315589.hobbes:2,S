	It is right, though.  monotonic_clock() is defined as returning
nanoseconds, not a value based on HZ.  It's supported on x86 and x86-64,
hence using CONFIG_X86 to check.  Someday, John will get it implemented
for the other platforms, and we'll have less mess in hangcheck-timer.c.
He already thinks that he should have the prototype in timer.h or so (so
I don't have to extern declare it), but he hasn't gotten around to it
yet.
