Yes.. And I agree almost completely. Except for binfmt_misc! (see below)

Ah. But this thread started with the notion that disabling (through
#ifdef's, but holds also for dummy-functions) /proc for binfmt_misc is
not a good idea since it no longer is usable (you need to configure it
through /proc!). You said something like: It better generate an error than
to compile and not work, since you wouldn't know why the h*ll it doesn't
work in runtime.
For binfmt_misc, a true dependency exists, which cannot be resolved with
the current "make config". There are other cases like this, where a
"forward dependency" is the problem (*). One way of solving this is with a
"Requires" statement (Alan suggests that). I have done some preliminary
work on "Requires", a script that does this can be found at
