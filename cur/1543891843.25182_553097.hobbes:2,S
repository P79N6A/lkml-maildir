My patch was actually written with ARM machines in mind and has been
extremely well tested on it. A version which doesn't run on ARM is not
acceptable. Its also ironic that "platform conditional code" is what a
lot of that bloat you're so keen to remove is about.

Adrian's covered this. I also know how hard updating something like zlib
is (I was the last person to do it).

I *have* spent some time on it.
My speed comments were actually pretty positive. Yes, I screwed up one
of the benchmarks (as have others proving its easily done) but I did
admit to it. My others were fair comment and some issues were addressed
as a result (but not all).
I'm going to stop here. I don't agree with the rest of your email and
you've a distorted view of whats been said.
