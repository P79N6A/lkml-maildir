NFSv4 also has support for "named attributes"/forks/streams.  As far as
I can recall, though, the only requests I've seen for it (aside from
people just running through NFSv4 feature checklists) have been from
people that really just wanted extended attributes.
And it'd probably actually be pretty easy to extend the v4 protocol to
support extended attributes if someone wanted to.
