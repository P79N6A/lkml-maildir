Great for you, when I was testing sk98lin crashed my machine on
overnight stress run. My intuition is that there is a bug in sk98lin
on Yukon EC-U chips (those without ram buffer) and a hardware
problem on Yukon XL chips (those with ram buffer) and the sky2
driver doesn't have workaround for getting the ram buffer stuck (yet).
I don't like putting workarounds in for problems I can't reproduce.
After KS, I'll rerun more stress tests on all the chip flavors
and see if the hang is reproducible.
