It's not explained by slow start. Ping times are <200ms, so even with
the congestion window reduced to size 1 my machine still should have
only been waiting about 100ms for an ACK before transmitting the next
packet.
It could be congestion avoidance, but I fail to see why this should be
triggered when I'm uploading over a 33.6kbps ppp link to a machine on
an ethernet.  It's transfers in the other direction that should
trigger congestion avoidance.
In fact, what seems to be happening is that eventually it's settling
on a congestion window size of 1, waiting for each ack before sending
another packet.  This basically agrees with what I observed after it
sped up again, but still doesn't explain the period of time where it
only was sending about 1 packet per second.  It also doesn't explain
why it didn't increase the congestion window during this.
BTW, I only brought it up because I haven't observed this behavior
with 2.0.x.
