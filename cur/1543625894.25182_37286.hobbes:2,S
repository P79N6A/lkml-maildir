You could reason that since the immutable flag is set at i_mode, and i_mode
stores file modes, it should be legal to change the inode (mtime) as long as
you do not change the contents of the file.
Or at least that that would be the intention of chattr, if you re-read the
page:
       A  file with the i' attribute cannot be modified: it can<AD>
       not be deleted or renamed, no link can be created to  this
       file  and  no  data  can  be written to the file. Only the
       superuser can set or clear this attribute.
Even if you obviate the inode/file difference, by changing mtime you aren't
either deleting, renaming, linking or writing data to the file, so you are
consistent to the pubished documentation.
