And just to confirm that, I just tested the current DRM modules against a 
2.6.23.15 kernel.  It suspends to disk correctly (w/o a hang) and doesn't 
give me a green screen, so something in 2.6.25 must be causing that (even 
2.6.25-rc1 seems to have the problem).
Also, this patch against 2.6.25-rc1 seemed to prevent the 'green screen' 
problem.  2.6.25-rc2 already has part of it...
Anyway, let me know how your testing goes.
Thanks,
Jesse
