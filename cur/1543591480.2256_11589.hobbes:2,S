Excuse me?
Alan, it sounds very much like you just said something stupid.  This
seems sufficiently unlikely that I am shaking my head in disbelief and
fingernailing wax out of both ears (and if you think doing both those
things at once is easy try it sometime :-)).
Do you really believe that anyone is going to maintain the CML1 tools
for as long as a nanosecond after they get dropped out of the kernel tree?
Even supposing somebody were loony enough to do that, how would preserving
an old interface in amber do anything to explore new UI possibilities?
Perhaps I'm just unusually dense this morning.
