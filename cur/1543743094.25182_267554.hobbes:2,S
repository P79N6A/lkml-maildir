you're asking about spending one byte?  one byte extra for code which 
could perform better on more CPUs?
i could equally well say "k8 is not the only x86-64 cpu on the planet".
i really don't care whether this change is made or not, i only mentioned a 
general perf rule.
go ahead and use -Os for the rest of the kernel if you're worried about 
size, it'll likely go faster.  but spending 1 byte in code which is perf 
critical is nothing.
