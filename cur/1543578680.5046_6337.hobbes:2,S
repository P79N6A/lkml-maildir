Hm, could it be that the fact that network throughput is halved causes the
problem not to appear? Remember, it only appears under HEAVY network load. A
single nfs cp -rd <big_dir> was not enough to hang my network, I needed to add
at least another cp -rd or some streaming audio or something else...
