I was wondering if someone can offer some advice as to how I can track this 
scsi error down.  Below is the message printed to the console before the 
system locked up.
scsi : aborting command due to timeout : pid 236637, scsi0, channel 0, id 
0, lun
  0 Write (10) 00 00 3a b0 1b 00 00 02 00
scsi0: Unable to Abort Command to Target 0 - CCB Reset
SCSI host 0 abort (pid 236615) timed out - resetting
SCSI bus is being reset for host 0 channel 0.
scsi0: Resetting BusLogic BT-930 due to Target 0
scsi0: *** BusLogic BT-930 Initialized Successfully ***
Kernel panic: scsi_free:Trying to free unused memory
In swapper task - not syncing
Thanks, David
