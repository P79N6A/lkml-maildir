OK, would calling it "*-2.4" or something help?

Execing the older binary is a good way to make a clean break in the
source.  It means we can keep separate maintainers and not worry about
syncing issues, too (Keith has said he doesn't want to maintain
modules in 2.5, fair enough)
There are other ways to do the same thing, bu this seemed simplest.

Sorry if I was a bit sharp.  I've been surprised by the "I'm going to
have to abandon 2.5 kernel development now" reaction.  Some people
seem upset that I didn't respond to mail for 12 hours 8( I also
haven't spoken to my wife for over 48 hours because I've been on the
modem in my hotel room every time she's been awake.

Unfortunately the Alpha ELF spec is in RTH's head.  I have a userspace
framework I can send you (faster than debugging linking inside the
kernel) which you can hack for Alpha.
To see what's coming, look for the "Modules" section:
