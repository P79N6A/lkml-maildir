Grin, I'm partial to changing sync_supers to allow the FS to leave
s_dirt set in its write_super call.
I see what ext3 gains from your current patch in the unmount case, but
the sync case is really unchanged because of interaction with kupdate. 
Other filesystems trying to use the sync_fs() call might think adding
one is enough to always get called on sync, and I think that will lead
to unreliable sync implementations.
