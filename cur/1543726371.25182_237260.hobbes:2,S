I messed with that at one point and didn't have a noticible improvement in
getting the crash to happen.  I'd recommend not going lower than sleep(1)
since that still gives irqbalance some time to amass stats prior to the
next iteration.

You mean like what does "cat /proc/interrupts" show?  One thing I could do
is have a "watch -n 1 cat /proc/interrupts" running in one screen while
the tests are running, and then when the crash happens copy/paste the
results.  Would that be useful?

I've had mixed results with this.  In theory the list corruption can
happen while irqbalance has been running, and then after stopping it, days
later the crash can happen when a corrupted list item is finally accessed.
Should I try the run-once/oneshot feature of irqbalance on boot, and then
leave it off and see if anything happens?
Thanks,
Chris
