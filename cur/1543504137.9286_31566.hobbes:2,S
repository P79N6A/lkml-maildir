Then perhaps the best compromise is to make SCHED_IDLE a compile
time option.  If you want to support "true" SCHED_IDLE you must take
the performance hit in schedule() to be safe from lock starvation.
If you don't compile "true" SCHED_IDLE into the kernel it would
just get mapped to be the same as 'nice 19' or whatever.
