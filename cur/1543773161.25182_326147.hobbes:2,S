btw., you have this enabled in your config:
   CONFIG_DEBUG_RT_LOCKING_MODE=y
this causes old-style spinlocking to be activated by default. I.e. you 
dont get most of the benefits of PREEMPT_RT. You can reactivate it via:
	echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/preempt_locks
but obviously this runtime flag involves some runtime overhead in the 
locking code. This .config option is mainly meant to enable the 
measurement of the locking overhead of PREEMPT_RT, and to debug boot 
problems that might be related to PREEMPT_RT locking.  So you'd almost 
always want to run with DEBUG_RT_LOCKING_MODE turned off.
