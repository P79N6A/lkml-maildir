I have recently upgraded to an AMD processor that is exhibiting the
problems with the AMD speculative caching bug. Kernel 2.4.19 seems to
fix the problem with the temporary work-around (adv-spec-cache patch). I
have noticed that the patch has been removed from 2.4.20 and I am
wondering if there is some other mechanism that is supposed to address
this issue. Currently I have a  2.4.20 kernel with same configuration as
my 2.4.19 and the problem seems to have reappeared.
			Thanks for any information.
