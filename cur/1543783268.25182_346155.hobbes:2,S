How can we handle it, if we do not even know that it failed? How should the
user recognize something is broken?

Well, regarding speedstep-centrino, it is news to me that the MSR write can
fail... if it can fail, we should check for it.

It looks to me as somebody had experienced that the transition only
succeeded after waiting for some time.
But well, as you do know the ACPI spec better than I do, I'll accept your
evaluation that this patch won't cause any trouble.
