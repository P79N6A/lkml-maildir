Interesting. If this is true (non-root 'pushes the shellstack' (what's
meant by that?) and executes code as root), then it's a serious security
issue.
However, it's completely separate from the disk-destroyer case,
because if he can do that, then with the couple bytes of code he can
gain normal root access and that's much more dangerous than just frying
the system.
