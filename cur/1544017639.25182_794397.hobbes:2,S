Hi,
I am building kernels on x86 and there is a problems with include2/asm
symbolic link
when building the with 'make O=./HOST".
- with 2.6.28.x the include/asm-x86 is moved to arch/x86/include/asm
  so this code is no more valid:
  ln -fsn $(srctree)/include/asm-$(SRCARCH) include2/asm;
That line of code should be made ARCH aware? I don't know how to do that, I can
only change that for x86 only.
BTW: I am not subscribed to lkml, please CC when replying, thanks
