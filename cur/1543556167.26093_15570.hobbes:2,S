This is a followup to my own message to report that the mixer is
working again after I disabled the CONFIG_SOUND_TVMIXER option. I
don't know what exactly this option does (no help text), but since I
have a Hauppauge (BT878) TV-card, I did enable this option. In
test11, drivers/media/video/tvmixer.c was modified so that it now
looks for tvmixer devices, and it actually finds one:
  tvmixer: debug: MSP3415D-A2 
  tvmixer: MSP3415D-A2 (bt848 #0) registered with minor 0 
  tvmixer: debug: (unset) 
This mixer probably replaces the normal AC97 mixer device. So, in
what situations do you need CONFIG_SOUND_TVMIXER? It would be nice if
someone could come up with an entry for Documentation/Configure.help.
