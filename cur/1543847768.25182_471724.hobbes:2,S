Why should Openswan touch /dev/hw_random directly?

 The rngd daemon acts as a bridge between a Hardware TRNG (true random number
 generator) such as the ones in some Intel/AMD/VIA chipsets, and the kernel's
 PRNG (pseudo-random number generator).
 .
 It tests the data received from the TRNG using the FIPS 140-2 (2002-10-10)
 tests to verify that it is indeed random, and feeds the random data to the
       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 kernel entropy pool.
 [...]
There is a good reason why /dev/hw_random is different from /dev/random...
