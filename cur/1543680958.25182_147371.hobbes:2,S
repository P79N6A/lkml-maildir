Well, you probably did want Linus to answer, but I see some new stuff
here.

If those panic()s happen for the users, then this is bugfix.

This is bugfix.

This seems extremely hard to do right. If you can do it right and not
rewrite half of kernel, that's okay, but I don't think you can do that.

That seems like missfeature. We don't want joe random user that is at
the console to prevent suspend by just pressing Escape. Maybe magic
