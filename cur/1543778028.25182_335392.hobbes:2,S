The bugs were in the patches for the 2.6.10 kernel not SuSE's 2.6.5 
kernel.  I reported some of them to the ckrm-tech mailing list at the 
time.  There were changes to the vanilla scheduler between 2.6.5 and 
2.6.10 that were not handled properly when the CKRM scheduler was 
upgraded to the 2.6.10 kernel.
