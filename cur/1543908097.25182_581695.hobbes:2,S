As long as the security labels are themselves not being exported to the 
kernel to be used e.g. for display or transport, then I agree, and we 
should avoid passing them around outside the LSM entirely if possible.
Usually, they're attached to a significant kernel object, which you 
typically pass around as part of the interface anyway.
David, I've looked at the code and can't see that you need to access the 
label itself outside the LSM.  Could you instead simply pass the inode 
pointer around?
(I know it's not always possible, but much preferred).
