OK, fingers crossed.  Juergen, it would be great if you could test Oleg's
patch sometime.
Oleg, could you please review the changelog in
timers-fixes-improvements.patch sometime, make sure that it's all accurate
and complete?
Also, please review the comments in timer.c - some of the info which you
placed in that changelog really should be brought into the code itself so
people can understand the data structures and their interactions without
having to trawl the changelogs and mailing list archives.
For example, in __mod_timer:
	if (timer_pending(timer)) {
		detach_timer(timer, 0);
		ret = 1;
	}
	new_base = &__get_cpu_var(tvec_bases);
	if (base != &new_base->t_base) {
		/*
		 * We really need a comment here explaining what
		 * (base != &new_base->t_base) *means*
		 */
		if (unlikely(base->running_timer == timer)) {
