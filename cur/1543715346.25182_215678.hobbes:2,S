Hi,
     I've been trying all day to get 2.6.3 booting on my server from 
2.4.22. I've run into a major issue with the initrd, and I can't figure 
out what's going on. The kernel finds the initrd and mounts it on root, 
but then the first command I have (mount /proc) fails with an error that 
it can't create a lock on mtab because there is no space left on the 
device. Everything else after that blows up. I thought I'd be clever and 
create a bogus file on the initrd, then delete it as the first step in 
linuxrc so that there is space on the device, but I still get the same 
error. My 2.4.22 kernel works find with a very similar initrd, so I'm 
having trouble figuring out what is different here. I've done all kinds 
of google searches on this and haven't found anything very helpful other 
than some references to initramfs. Any thoughts?
Thanks,
Derek
