Yeah, you're right, that wouldn't be a good thing to do.  I guess I'll have to 
hang a different structure off of the pci_dev so we can tell the sysfs rom 
handling code where to get the rom.  Doing it that way would allow us to deal 
with cards that really need a copy made too, though the default behavior 
would be to read it directly.
How does that sound?
