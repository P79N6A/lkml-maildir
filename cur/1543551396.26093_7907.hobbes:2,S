} Are you sure? I just I tried it 2.91.66 and it works. With 
} -fomit-frame-pointer only __builtin_return_address(0) works, but that is
} true for any version.
I've found, with several versions of gcc, that leaf functions will give
bad results (sometimes resulting in a bad access fault) with calls to
__builtin_return_address(0).  The workaround in the kernel and RTLinux is
making a call do your function isn't a leaf.
