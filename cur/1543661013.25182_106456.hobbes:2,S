Well, what do you do (think 2.5.x) when you don't have keyboard drivers
compiled in? I currently do use them as loaded modules, *if* at all I do
need them. Most of the time, my alphas only have two (or three) cables
plugged in: power, network and possibly serial console... If there's a
monitor, it's wired to a monitor switch (so you can see the messages,
but basically, since there's no keyboard support loaded, it's useless),
but it won't be used. Serial console is my way to go...
