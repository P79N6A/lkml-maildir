I'm a bit uncertain about the whole UIO idea, really.  I have this vague
feeling that we'd prefer to encourage people to move device drivers into
GPL'ed kernel rather than encouraging them to do closed-source userspace
implementations which will probably end up being slower, less reliable and
unavailable on various architectures, distros, etc.
But I don't think I have the capacity to actually think about this further
- just tossing it out there ;)

eh?  How come a particular device requires 156 lines of kernel code to
support a userspace driver?  Doesn't that kind of defeat the point?
