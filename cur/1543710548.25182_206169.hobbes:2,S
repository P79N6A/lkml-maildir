it is. Linus simply provided a solution to the mremap issue, that is to
make it impossible to share anonymous pages through an mremap, that
solves the problem indeed at some cpu and memory cost after an mremap.
I realized you could solve it also by walking the whole list of vmas in
every mm->mmap list but that complexity would be way too high.

It still looks like quite an hack to me, though I must agree in a
desktop scenario with swapoff -a, it will save around 24 bytes per
anonymous vma and 12 bytes per file vma plus it doesn't restrict the vma
merging in any way, compared to my anon_vma, and it avoids me to worry
about people doing a flood of vma_splits that will generate a long list
of vmas for every anon_vma.
I still feel anon_vma is more preferable than
anonmm+linus-unshare-mremap if one needs to swap, and while the
prio_tree on i_mmap{shared} in practice is needed only for 32bit apps, I
know some app with hundred of processes allocating huge chunks of direct
anon memory each and swapping a lot at the same time.
