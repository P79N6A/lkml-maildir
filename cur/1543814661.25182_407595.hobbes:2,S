Hmm.  Which of the implementations that you've seen will return
something not backed by a struct page?  On the half dozen arches I've
looked at (i386/x86_64, powerpc, sparc64, ia64, mips), every one uses
either kmalloc, __get_free_pages, or __alloc_pages at some point, and I
think they all have struct pages behind them.

Bleh.  Perhaps I'm being dense here, but if I'm making a request of
non-zero order and the slab has already been allocated, won't it be
populated with compound pages anyway?  Or will it have been allocated as
a single giant compound page, just handing me back individual hunks of
the appropriate size?
I ask this because I seemed to be getting compound pages out of
dma_alloc_coherent even when I *wasn't* passing in __GFP_COMP.  This is
apparently why PG_private was set on the individual pages I was getting
back.
