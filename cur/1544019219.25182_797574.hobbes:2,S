It is probably worth adding casts to avoid the potential for overflow,
but it's not likely that this would ever be a problem in practice.
Someone would need a pretty big per-device memory area for this to ever
overflow anyways, and if the device has that much memory, people are
probably going to want to do something else with it besides designating
all of it for DMA buffer usage ;-)
