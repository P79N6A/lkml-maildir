Yes.  I think this behaviour is considered to be desperately broken by 
the gcc developers and has been fixed in all recent gccs.  There are a 
couple of broken versions, and there have been patches floating around 
to just refuse to use them; otherwise __weak is effectively unusable.  
(Ah, I see Adrian has posted it again and everyone agrees with it.)
On the other hand, I have seen a couple of instances of "inline __weak" 
which is insane, but I don't know if gcc does anything crazy with it, or 
if its common enough to bother warning about.
