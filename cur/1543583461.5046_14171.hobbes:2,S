Debian Sid currently includes a binutils that drops the option the kernel
uses. If you look through the archive you'll find a patch to do deal with
this, or you can just go back to a slightly older binutils
Also gcc 2.95.3 cvs snapshots aren't yet a recommended build tool for the 
kernel. They are probably ok though. I've had no evidence to suggest they
miscompile anything.
