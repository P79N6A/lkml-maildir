Sorry..  didn't mean to offend anyone..  I'm not refering to PID
wrap here, I'm refering to a freshly booted system in which once
everything is up and running, the lowest PID of a running service
is 300 to 600 or more.  Nothing under 100 except kernel threads.
3 root@asdf:/stuff# ps ax
  PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
    1 ?        S      0:05 init

Assuming or generalizing things will be at certain PID's or below
certain PID's is very bad because it is 99% unpredicatable.  That
is the important thing that I had to say - put into more verbose
terms for those that couldn't derive it..
Again, sorry if I was a bit brief about it... 
take care,
TTYL
