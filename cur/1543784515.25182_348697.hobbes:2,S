The sk98lin driver is wrapped around VPD for it's silly proprietary
network management interface.

Skge doesn't use VPD for anything, it works fine on my D-Link card.
The same data is available for applications that have a need
(like linux-diag lsvpd) via the standard pci interface in sysfs.
Now that skge is in 2.6.13, perhaps the proper thing to do is to take
DGE-530T out of the PCI table for sk98lin?
