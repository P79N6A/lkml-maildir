Hi,
I have hard-linked the prepatches I have been able to find into 
/pub/linux/kernel/v*.*/testing/old/, following the "modern" naming 
scheme, so the incdiff robot could produce incrementals against them.
First, I wanted to let you know what the deal was... they are just 
hardlinks against what is elsewhere (/pub/linux/testing or 
/pub/linux/people), with different names.
Second, there were several prepatches that did not apply cleanly, which 
broke the robot, and which I had to remove from the testing/old 
directories (I did not touch the original link, of course.)  The only 
one that was anywhere close to recent and might be worth fixing was 
2.0.40-pre2; the other ones were 2.2.18 versions (-pre1,2,3,4, and 26.)
I mostly wanted to give you everyone a heads-up.
