Those bits are used today for page_zone() and page_to_nid().  I assume
that you don't support NUMA, but how do you get around the page_zone()
definition?  (a quick grep in asm-sparc64 didn't show anything obvious)
        static inline struct zone *page_zone(struct page *page)
        {
                return zone_table[page->flags >> NODEZONE_SHIFT];
        }
        
BTW, in theory, the new patch should allow page->flags to be better
managed by a variety of users, including special arch users.  An
architecture should be able to relatively easily add the necessary
pieces to reserve them.  We could even have a ARCH_RESERVED_BITS macro
or something.
