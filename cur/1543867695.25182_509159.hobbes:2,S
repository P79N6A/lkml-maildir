What about a setsockopt or just random port selection patch? :)

It is only about one syscall in get and set/swap context, btw, so it
should not be a main factor, doesn't it?
As an advertisement note, but if you have a lot of network events per epoll 
read try to use kevent - its socket notifications do not require
additional traverse of the list of ready events as in poll usage.
