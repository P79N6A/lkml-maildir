hello:
Yes, it was missing module-init-tools. Now I have my kernel compiled but when I try to boot, I can only see 
Uncompressing Kernel... booting linux....
and then I cannot see nothing more but the HD is going up and down during half a minute, so I think something is happening but my screen is not updating.
What can I test in order to boot my system?
I'm behing a Sony Vaio N505-VE laptop.
Thanks.
