A few weeks ago I did check the state of Linux's handling of big files
(> 2 GB). From that I got the strong impression that the more and more
annoying 2 GB limit is pretty strongly enforced by the VFS layer if
Linux is running on a 32 bit CPU like the x86. That limit seems to be
independent of the basic capabilities of the file system.
I would love to be proved wrong but I don't have much hope. Is there a
realistic chance that a normal Linux system running on a 32 bit CPU will
eventually overcome the 2 GB file size limit?
