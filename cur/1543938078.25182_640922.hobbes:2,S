You seem to be under the illusion that iBCS2 support works currently
in mainline and that only this patch would break it. That's not 
the case.
It's a significant patchkit that was only available in 2.4 and is
now missing a lot of infrastructure and would probably be significant
non-trivial work to forward port. Now if someone does that work
they can as well readd the few hunks I'm removing here.
