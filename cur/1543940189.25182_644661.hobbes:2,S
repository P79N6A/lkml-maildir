Subject: [2.6 patch] x86: allow 64bit setting in Kconfig
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Recently someone told me he had a bug on x86 and to reproduce
it I should "'make allyesconfig' and disable CONFIG_HOTPLUG=y".
But I didn't see it.
"make allyesconfig" is ambiguous on x86 and he had a 64bit computer.
There go another two hours compile time.
It makes sense to have the Kconfig default and the defconfig based on 
whether you are on a 32bit or a 64bit machine, but it's complete 
nonsense to not offer the Kconfig variable unless you had explicitely 
given ARCH=x86 (in which case you could as well immediately set the ARCH 
to i386 or x86_64).
