Yes, it is GPL-compatible.

Linus, you are mixing two completely different rights here; re-distribution
right and re-licensing right. Original license grants you GPL-compatible
re-distribution rights, which means that the code can be distributed and
linked with GPL code just fine. To relicense the code under more restrictive
license you need permission from all authors of the code. You clearly do not
have such permission from all authors. Therefore, you can not re-license the
code.
