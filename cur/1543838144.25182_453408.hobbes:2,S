Fix: don't try to swap over the network.  Yes, there may be some scenarios
where people have no local storage, but it's reasonable to expect anyone
who is using Linux as an "enterprise storage platform" to stick a local
disk on the thing for swap.
That leaves MAP_SHARED, but mm-tracking-shared-dirty-pages.patch will fix
that, will it not?
