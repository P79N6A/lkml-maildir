This function is not really rt-mutex-related at all, is it?  It's just a
piece of new scheduler functionality which various things might use.
If so, it should be named something non-mutexy and should be under a
different CONFIG_option which CONFIG_RT_MUTEXES selects.
Of course, we can do all that later on, if/when something else needs this
facility.
