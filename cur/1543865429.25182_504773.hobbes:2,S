That would explain why I see link status changes but 0 interrupt count 
in /proc/interrupts. However, on >= 2.6.19 the link state never changes. 
Ever. It's always down. On <= 2.6.18 the link state does change but with 
0 interupt count.

This does not seem to work on 2.6.19+. Unless the watchdog interval is 
tens of minutes. I've waited at least 5 minutes and link never went up.

Will continue to dig.
