If you had LTC's Event Logging installed, and you had your kernel
configured to forward printk messages to the event log, you could
do something like this:
evlnotify -f 'data~"NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth0: transmit timed out"' \
	-a 'ifconfig eth0 down; ifconfig eth0 up'
That would cause the ifconfig down/up to run each time the indicated
printk happened.
