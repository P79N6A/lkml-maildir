So the above was obviously tongue-in-cheek, but you should really think 
about the context here.
We're discussing doing *single* system calls. There is absolutely zero 
point to try to parallelize the work over multiple CPU's or threads. We're 
literally talking about doing things where the actual CPU cost is in the 
hundreds of nanoseconds, and where traditionally a rather noticeable part 
of the cost is not the code itself, but the high cost of taking a system 
call trap, and saving all the register state.
When parallelising "real work", I absolutely agree with you: we should use 
threads. But you need to look at what it is we parallelize here, and ask 
yourself why we're doing what we're doing, and why people aren't *already* 
just using a separate thread for it.
