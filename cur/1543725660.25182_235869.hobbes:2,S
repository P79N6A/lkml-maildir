ok, rebooted ignored the kudzu stuff about the old 8139too, fired up x 
and used redhat-config-network to deactive both (which now had the 
same MAC address) and rebuilt a new eth0 using the relabeled 
forcedeth driver, moved the cable and restarted the network.  It all 
works.
So, lemme go get the /etc/sysconfig/iptables file and include it, 
because I cannot see anything that makes use of the MAC address in 
any of it.  As you can see from the accounting, lots of data has 
moved.

---------------------
The BitTorrent stuff didn't work :(, but I've not removed it...
Probhably something in the router, a linksys BEFSR41 w/latest flash.
If there is nothing above thats responsible, then it seems to me it 
has to be arp related.  I've just now started studying the manpages 
there, and I'm not too sure what I need to do there in order to 
restore full function to the new MAC address if and when I put it 
back to something nvidia related.  Pointers welcome in any case.
