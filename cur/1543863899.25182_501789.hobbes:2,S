Btw, aio_sendfile and aio_sendfile_path use naive and actually the 
simplest approach of async IO - it just stupidly blocks on sending or 
resends (like repeated sending approach) - I'm a bit lazy to use kevent 
there, since there is _no_ gain after a bit more deep analysis 
(hint: there are multiple IO threads, some of them might block), 
and network AIO does not exist (yet, kevent status is in hinged state,
and I was asked to postpone additional feature addons, which otherwise
could happen a bit more frequently then current kevent/kernel releases), 
due to kevent future is indeterminate...
