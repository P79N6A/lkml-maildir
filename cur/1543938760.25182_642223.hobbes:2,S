I think not allowing MFGPT timers for broken BIOSen is the right way to go.
We can do  just-in-time detection the first time one of the drivers (timer
tick or watchdog) asks for a timer, instead of the current way of probing
automatically.
That way, you can go merrily on your way if you don't try to use any of
the MFGPTs.  TinyBIOS users can compile out CONFIG_GEODE_MFGPT_TIMER and
boot.
I'll write up a patch.
Thanks,
Jordan
