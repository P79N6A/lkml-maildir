BS. This has nothing to do with "accepting connections from addresses":

You may guess now, which the _real_ IP address of "mail.intermeta.de"
is.  Yes, "that other mailer" leaks this information. But only for its
own, local IP address.
More "real world" you can't get as in this example. The box transfers
about 1000 Mails per day which may not be much in todays internet but
is fine as "my little mail home". Percentage of failed mails because
of [ip-addr] adressing: 0.00%
So where lies the problem with all this? If the current reporting of
the netmasks is a bug: Fine, fix it, get on with life.  
I agree totally with Alan here. If the config can be reported by the
4.3 API, then it should be and be correct. If it can't: Well tough
luck for "really, really" portable mailers.
	Regards
