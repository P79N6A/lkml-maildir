This is something that could be addressed by the Makefiles.  It can be
argued that "make install" should put a system map in a version-specific
directory or give it a version-specific name, for example.  (It can also
be persuasively argued that the Makefiles should do nothing of the sort.)
Somewhat related to this:  is there some well-maintained document (other
than the scattered sources) which describes *all* of the sensible make
targets for the kernel?  "install", for example, exists and is quite
useful, but I can't even find it in the toplevel Makefile, let alone in
documentation from the kernel package.  And I never heard of
/sbin/installkernel until I went source diving to track down "install".
