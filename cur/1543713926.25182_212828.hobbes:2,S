I said above per-arch abstraction, a per-arch abstraction isn't an irq
safe spinlock, we cannot add an irq safe spinlock there, it'd be too bad
for all the common archs that don't need to walk those lists (actually
trees in my -aa tree) from irq context.
if you implement the locking abstraction with an irq safe spinlock it's
your own business then.
