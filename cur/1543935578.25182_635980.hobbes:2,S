This shouldn't be necessary.  The old 64-bit code defined everything 
without _PAGE_GLOBAL, but then used a MAKE_GLOBAL() macro to OR it in 
later.  This seemed a bit roundabout to me, so I just put it in from the 
outset.

You mean _PAGE_KERNEL_EXEC, which is assigned to the 32-bit 
__PAGE_KERNEL_EXEC variable?  It gets ORed in when it determines that 
the processor has the global capability.
If not, I'm not sure what you mean.
