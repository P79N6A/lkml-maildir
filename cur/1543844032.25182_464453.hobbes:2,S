Oddly enough, I identified exactly the same problem last week and 
submitted a nearly-identical patch just a few minutes ago.  The problem 
occurs only when CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND isn't set, and it stems from the fact 
that without this addition, the device's dev.power.power_state.event field 
doesn't get set properly during the resume.
