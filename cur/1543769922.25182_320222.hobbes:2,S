it's not really a problem - they integrate nicely. They also found 
dozens of hard-to-catch bugs already so if you dont care about embedded 
systems at all then worst-case you can consider it a spinlock debugging 
mechanism, with the difference that DEBUG_SPINLOCK is far uglier ;) 
Anyway, this discussion is premature, as i'm not submitting all these 
patches yet.
