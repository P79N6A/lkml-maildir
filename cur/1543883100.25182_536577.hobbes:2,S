It should be fixed 37 hours ago by
http://git.infradead.org/?p=users/cbou/battery2-2.6.git;a=commit;h=cbb1e1b9e3a2cbf62ce4c13ef95d146ebc5e7274
Should I ask git-pull when such fixes happens? And I wonder why it isn't
already in -mm, because you've added this git repository after that
commit...
Though, I'm doing "allmodconfig" once again, to be sure, it will take
some time. (I've done defconfig, with modular W1, BATTERY,
DS2760_BATTERY already, and error doesn't show up).

Also, much thanks for accepting it to the -mm.
I have one question though... battery2-2.6 have two branches,
"linus" (clean Linus' tree) and "master" (with battery stuff).
When I'll want to sync battery tree with Linus' once again,
should I just pull from linus, or it's better to rebase master against
linus, and then "git push -f" to the battery2-2.6 master branch?
Or it will break something on your side (as commits will change their
hash)?
Thanks,
