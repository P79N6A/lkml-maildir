Hi!
I'd posted here before, but no right answer yet:(
On my PC ( Celeron (Coppermine) 850Mhz RAM 256Mb i810)  2.4.x kernel runs
VERY SLOW, like at old i386. The SAME kernel works good on (iP200MMX + 96MB
+ iTX430) and on (Duron 888Mhz + 128MB + VIA KT133A). 2.2.19 kernel works
fine on all systems, but I like netfilter very much:)
I try many different configuration (APM,ACPI,no ACPI, no APM,APM+ACPI,no at
all) but no chance.
I try to enable/disable APM/ACPI in my BIOS - the same results :(
Any ideas?
