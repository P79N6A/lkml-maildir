Hi people , i am thinking about process migration.
And the idea to transfer a simples task is:
Thread1 in NODE A    <-------TCP CONN----------->   Thread2 in NODE B

- select task by
    -verify the availability  of these virtual addresses.
if it busy , free the memory of these virtual addresses.
- get structs mm , vma , task , zone , page
  and copy all buffers existing in the
         -alloc all the buffer of task.
- send all buffers to
        -re-build structs (alloc_task_struct,page_zone,pte_page...)
                                                                            
               -INIT_LIST_HEAD()
                                                                            
               -wake_up_process()
-send all virtual addresses to thread2
Please , i´d like some comments/ideas about this.
thanks
