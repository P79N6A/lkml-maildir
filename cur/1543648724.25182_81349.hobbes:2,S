I'd disagree.  I would like to see selinux included in the mainstream
kernel someday, but I know that selinux needs quite a bit of work
(Christoph says "rewrite") to make it acceptable.  It also doesn't make
much sense to submit selinux until after the remainder of LSM has been
submitted for possible merging and after some level of pruning
and refinement of LSM has occurred.  I would also expect other security
modules, e.g. DTE, to be submitted by their authors eventually.  If there
aren't any in-tree users of LSM, then there is little motivation for the
kernel developers to retain LSM.
