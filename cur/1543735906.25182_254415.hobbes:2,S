What problem is this supposed to fix?  ESP is __not__ corrupted
when returning to protected-mode or a different privilege level.
You don't 'return' to protected mode from a virtual-8086 mode,
even though you (can) use an `iret`instruction. The fundamental
change is though the EFLAGS register stored in the TSS.
The so-called bug is that when in real mode or in virtual-8086
mode, the high word of ESP is not changed. It is not a bug
because the high word doesn't even exist when in VM-86 mode!!
It is possible to use the 32-bit prefix, when in 16-bit mode,
to muck with the high word of the stack, but that's not
a documented procedure, but a side-effect of such an undocumented
instruction.
There is no bug to fix. When the VM-86 mode transitions to
32-bit protected mode, the stack is restored to the condition
it was just prior to the transition to VM-86 mode, therefore you
don't "use up" any stack. The so-called bug is only cosmetic
when somebody is prowling around in undocumented shadows.
Please, somebody from Intel tell these guys to leave the thing
alone. I, for one, don't want a bunch of "fixes" that do nothing
except consume valuable RAM, making it near impossible to
use later versions of Linux in embedded systems.
