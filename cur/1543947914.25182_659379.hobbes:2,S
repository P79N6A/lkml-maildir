Arjan , sorry for the lag.
With your patch from 
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=120336371506283&w=2
 I don't have a warning anymore.
There are the 2 dmesg's , one from 2.6.25-rc3 and other from 2.6.25-rc3+your patch:
http://frugalware.org/~crazy/dmesg/dmesg
http://frugalware.org/~crazy/dmesg/dmesg_with_patch
It seems I'm not alone with that :)
Have a look at
