CONFIG_TULIP_MWI is duplicated in
linux-2.4.21-pre7/Documentation/Configure.help. Which one is correct?
New Tulip bus configuration
CONFIG_TULIP_MWI 
  This configures your Tulip card specifically for the card and
  system cache line size type you are using.
  This is experimental code, not yet tested on many boards.
  If unsure, say N.

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
