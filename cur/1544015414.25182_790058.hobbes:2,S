drivers/pci/probe.c: In function 'pci_bus_show_cpuaffinity':
drivers/pci/probe.c:56: error: implicit declaration of function 'cpumask_of_pcibus'

    cpumask: update pci_bus_show_cpuaffinity to use new cpumask API
    Impact: use new cpumask API to reduce stack usage
    Replace the local cpumask_t variable with a pointer to the
    const cpumask that needs to be printed.

I'm surprised linux-next builds didn't catch this.
