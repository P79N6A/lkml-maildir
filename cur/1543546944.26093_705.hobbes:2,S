In other words, with three threads we have
read(fd1...)					fd2=dup(fd1);
			close(fd1);
...
[here read() would succeed]
...
						close(fd2);
_not_ aborting read() and in absence of the third thread we _do_ abort
read(). QED: close(dup(fd1)) changes the behaviour of program.
IIRC, you've agreed that it was wrong just a couple of posts upthread.

Yes? How about close() right _after_ read() returns? Should it
retroactively change the return value to -EBADF? You have the race
anyway.
Look: you are asking for completely new mechanism for aborting blocked
IO operations. Occam's Razor applies.
Arguments against that mechanism:
	* doesn't work unless caller has all references to file at hands
and remembers about them.
	* doesn't provide anything new compared to kill(2).
	* in the case when read would succeed it introduces a new effect -
close(dup(fd)) changes the program behaviour.
What are your arguments for the inclusion of this mechanism, aside of the
fact that Solaris has it?
It's not fixing a bug. Application does blocking operation and then uses a
mechanism that would abort that operation on Solaris. This mechanism
doesn't work on Linux. There is another mechanism that works on both; as
the matter of fact it works on every UNIX. You are asking to add the
former to Linux. Question: what for? It's not a demagogy, I honestly don't
see the rationale for that change. That's my problem with your suggestion
and I would really like to hear the explantion on that point.
