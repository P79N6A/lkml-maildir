Uniform Multi-Platform E-IDE driver Revision: 7.00alpha2
ide: Assuming 33MHz system bus speed for PIO modes; override with
idebus=xx
ide0: I/O resource 0x1F0-0x1F7 not free.
ide0: ports already in use, skipping probe
Probing IDE interface ide1...
hdc: HTS721060G9AT00, ATA DISK drive
Appears first and that's where the other driver has taken control of the
drives. I had the same issue on my thinkpad, getting rid of the whole
IDE stuff solved the problem (because the other drivers does no longer
grab the drive).
This ThinkWiki entry should apply to your laptop just as well, just
replace /dev/hda with /dev/hdc.

Probably ide0 is pure SATA, while ide1 has the PATA adapters (just a
guess).
