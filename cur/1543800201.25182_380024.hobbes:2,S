If you're carrying around a mostly current tree, you should probably not
use "rsync" (which is probably why you're seeing that pack line)
Run this:
	sed -i.old -e 's/rsync/git/' .git/remotes/origin
and your pulls should go significantly faster.
(The file named "origin" might be in .git/branches/, also.)
You want the file to contain pretty much just this line:
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git
Also, out of curiosity, do:
	du -sh .git/objects/ .git/objects/pack/
You shouldn't see a .git/objects/pack/ much greater than 200 meg, in
fact, on freshly cloned tree it would only be about 100 meg:
