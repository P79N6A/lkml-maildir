NULL is equivalent to &proc_root in that context; moreover, it's better
style - drivers really shouldn't be refering to what is procfs-private

That's not something allowed outside of procfs code - lifetime rules

but if your code really uses that stuff, I want details on the intended
use.  In that case your design is almost certainly asking for trouble.
