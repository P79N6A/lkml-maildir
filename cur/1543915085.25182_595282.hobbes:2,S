I've got code for this in RHEL 3, but never bothered to
merge it upstream since I thought people with large memory
systems would be running 64 bit kernels by now.
Obviously I was wrong.  Andrew, are you interested in a
fix for this problem?
IIRC I simply kept a list of all buffer heads and walked
that to reclaim pages when the number of buffer heads is
too high (and we need memory).  This list can be maintained
in places where we already hold the lock for the buffer head
freelist, so there should be no additional locking overhead
(again, IIRC).
