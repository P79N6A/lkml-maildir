This only works if head->next == entry otherwise you lose half your
list.  Also, none of this is SMP-safe.
I think you need something like this (but with locking!)
/*
 * remove entry from list starting at head
 * Return 0 if successful, non-zero otherwise.
 */
static inline int slist_del(struct slist *head, struct slist *entry)
{
	struct slist **p;
	for (p = &head->next; *p; p = &(*p)->next)
	    if (*p == entry) {
	       *p = entry->next;
	       entry->next = NULL;
	       return 0;
        }
        return -1;
}
