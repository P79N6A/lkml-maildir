oh, it has a bunch of problems :)  over-threading created complexity in
the fast path.  It always spends memory on a contiguous header region for
each connection, which may not be valid in the days of zero copy sendmsg.
It does IO in the fast path.  And looking back at it, I'm struck by how
naive most of the code is :) :)
I've always been tempted to go back and take a real swing at a
nice content server, but there's only so many hours in the day, and
apache+thttpd+tux complete the problem space.  If X15 isn't released
with an open license, I may be tempted yet again :)
