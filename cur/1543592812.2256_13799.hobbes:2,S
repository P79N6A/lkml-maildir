Not an error.
The new PDC20268 has all the register data hidden form the user.
Another anti-user-friendly reaction by Promise Technology.
However, the up side is that they were smart enough to make the taskfile
registers for the setfeatures command auto set the host values.
Basically there are no data points that can be read from the new TX2 that
have any real trustable world meaning.
Cheers,
