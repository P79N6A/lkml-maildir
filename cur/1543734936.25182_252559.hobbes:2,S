Hi,
I do not think that taking/releasing spinlock here serves any purpose as
len can get canged right after releasing the lock and therefore no longer
valid... And relying on result of kfifo_len to decide if the FIF can be
drained is not reliable so probably the inteface is better off without this
function.
Also I think that most users would put only sertain structures (homogenous?)
in their FIFOs so maybe it should be:
struct kfifo *kfifo_alloc(unsigned int el_size, unsigned int len)
unsigned int kfifo_put(struct kfifo *fifo, void *buffer)
unsigned int kfifo_get(struct kfifo *fifo, void *buffer)
Also, don't we have a rule that for functions the opening curly brace should
be on a new line?
