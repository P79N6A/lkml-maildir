Unfortunately it isn't, because the whole thing occurs because
of a race between truncate and the page fault path.  Whatever
check we do, it's still possible for the race to hit us.
This is because vmtruncate walks the mms one by one, so the mms
already passed by vmtruncate can still fault in the not yet
truncated pages from the file.  I've stared at this thing for a
while and didn't come up with a way to prevent this, but maybe
somebody will find it ;)

According to Andrew it actually increases performance so it
doesn't seem as bad as it sounds.
