Subject: [RFC] [PATCH] Add 'make' with no target as preferred build command
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hello,
It seems for 2.5/2.6 'make' is the preferred command for building the
kernel tree (also stated in davej's 2.6 "what to expect" document). That
scenario however isn't even presented when the user finishes the kernel
configuration. This is a simple patch to scripts/kconfig/mconf.c which
tackles that, perhaps not in the best fashion but certainly in the
simplest.
Applies on top of bk-curr. Please consider.
