I am not a kernel hacker, but I think I have a kernel bug to report.
I have a hard time believing something so basic can be broken, but I
have ruled out every other explanation I can think of.
[1.] One line summary of the problem:
The CPU utilization reported through /proc/stat and the times()
syscall varies significantly (e.g., factors over 2) even when I think
the actual CPU consumption is essentially constant (e.g., varying by
less than 10%).
[2.] Full description of the problem/report:
I have this problem with network services but not programs with
narrower footprints (e.g., a simple loop).  I noticed this problem
when working with a more complex network service, but I have produced
a very simple network service that illustrates the problem (sources
are attached to this message).  The simple server is a non-threaded C
program.  It listens on a TCP socket, accepts one connection at a
time, and for that connection copies the input to the output, as long
as there is input, through fixed buffers (no explicit malloc nor free
in the loop).  The multithreaded client connects to the server and
then one thread goes into a simple loop that alternately sleeps and
writes a fixed buffer, while another thread reads and verifies the
echoes.  I have some instrumentation built into the server program,
and also use `procmeter3`, `ps`, and `top` to observe CPU and network
throughput from both client and server machines.  I see essentially
constant throughput, in bytes/second averaged over each reporting
period, as observed by `procmeter3` on both client and server, and
also as reported by the instrumentation in my server program.  I also
wrote an instrumented user-level idle loop, and when I run it,
`nice`d, in parallel with my simple server, it also reports counting
at essentially (+- 1%) a constant rate, as averaged over each
reporting period.  But the reported CPU utilization of the simple
network server varies over the same reporting periods.  And when I run
the `nice`d user-level idle loop in parallel, its reported CPU
utilization also varies (so that the sum of the two is essentially
100%).  The CPU utilization numbers get from the kernel to my eyes in
the following ways.  For one, I run procmeter3 (which get its CPU
utilization information from /proc/stat) on the server machine, and
ask it to show me "Stat-CPU" / "CPU" in graphical form (a snapshot is
attached to this message).  For another, my simple server reads the
CPU line of /proc/stat every reporting period, and reports
whole-machine CPU utilization based on that.  Finally, my simple
server also calls times() each loop iteration, and reports its
per-process CPU utilization based on that, aggregated over each
reporting period.
The CPU utilization can vary quite a lot.  In one case, it varied from
under 0.1% to about 50%, with a one-minute reporting period.  That is,
aggregated over one particular minute, less than one thousandth of the
machine's CPU goes to my simple server, while it's half the CPU over
the course of a different minute.
The variation usually has a fairly clearly-defined periodic shape.  I
have seen periods as low as 63 seconds and as high as 114 minutes;
colleagues report seeing periods up to about 150 minutes.  I have not
been able to determine what the period correlates with.  It holds
fairly constant for a given <client machine, client program &
parameters, server machine, server program & parameters> tuple.  I can
vary some of the parameters without significantly changing the period.
For fixed programs and parameters, the period can vary greatly for
different choices of <client machine, server machine>.
I have looked for this problem on uniprocessor Pentium machines
assembled by IBM, and seen it on every such machine at which I looked.
They have been Intellistation M-Pro and PC 300 machines.  When the
simple server was run on an Intellistation M-Pro, the CPU variation's
period was in the 1 to 3 minute range, and a one minute reporting
period was too short to make the pattern clear.  I saw the pattern
with a reporting period of 10 seconds, and saw it more clearly with a
reporting period of 5 seconds.  When the simple server was run on a PC
300 machine, the CPU variation's period was 5 minutes or more, and a
one minute reporting period was adequate to show the problem.  This
message reports some specifics from runs with the server on a PC
300PL.
I have looked for this problem on a uniprocessor RS/6000 machine
running AIX 4.3.3.  There I did not see a clearly defined CPU
variation of significant magnitude.
I have run my simple test client and server at various points within
the LAN in my office building.  The most common configuration involves
a box my support people describe as "an ethernet switch with IP
routing capability" --- but my client and server are on the same IP
subnet.  Between each of my machines and the abovementioned "box" is a
"smart ethernet hub" or "switch" concentrating 3 or 4 of my machines
onto a single connection to that "box".  All links are 100 Mb/s
ethernet.
I have attached a JPEG of the part of a procmeter3 display covering
about three cycles of one run.  You see horizontal lines for 0%, 20%,
40%, and 60% CPU utilization.  I have procmeter3's reporting period
set to 60 seconds, and the CPU variation's period is about 20 minutes.
Here are two excerpts from a run of both the simple server and the
`nice`d user-level idle loop, showing very different alleged CPU
utilizations by the simple test server and the user-level idle loop
--- and their own observations of constant progress:

Here is a brief guide to the output.  The first two blocks of text you
see are from the simple test server, at the end of a reporting period;
the third is from the instrumented user-level idle loop at the end of
one of its reporting periods.  This pattern repeats regularly in the
full typescript.  The excerpts above focus on two idle loop reports
and their surrounding test server reports (because the reporting
periods are not aligned).  The simple test server begins by reporting
the time at the end of the reporting period, with the number of
iterations and microseconds since the last report.  Then there is a
statistical summary of the numbers of bytes input by the read() calls
over the last period.  The summary's contents are: min, avg +-
std.dev., max, sum.  Then come statistical summaries of the elapsed
times (in microseconds) taken in the three phases of the server's loop
body (over the last reporting period): Input, copy & Munge, and
Output.  Then come statistical summaries of the CPU utilizations
reported for the server process by differencing times() for each
iteration in the last reporting period; "both" is the sum of the user
and system times.  The second text block from the simple test server
reports the breakdown from the CPU line of /proc/stat: first the raw
cumulative numbers, then the differences from the last report, and
finally each difference as a percentage of the sum of the differences.
The block from the instrumented user-level idle loop reports current
and differenced time and outer loop iterations, and then the ratio of
the two differences.
In all reports excerpted above, the simple test server says it has
echoed about 82 MB over the past approx. 60 seconds, and the
user-level idle loop does 476 +- 1 outer loop iterations over the past
approx. 60 seconds.  But the CPU utilization alleged for the test
server varies from about 38% to about 1%, while the idle loop's CPU
varies from about 52% to about 99%.  I don't have space to include
it here, but the procmeter3 display
also shows essentially constant network input and output throughput.
When I run the simple test server alone (without the idle loop in
parallel), I see no `nice`-level CPU usage, so I know all the `nice`
exhibited above is due to my `nice`d user-level idle loop.
[3.] Keywords (i.e., modules, networking, kernel):
networking, kernel, CPU utilization
[4.] Kernel version (from /proc/version):
I have seen this on Linux 2.2.something (RedHat 6.2), 2.4.something
(stock RedHat 7.1), 2.4.9-12, and 2.4.9-21 (the latest patch level of
RedHat 7.1).  For the last, here is /proc/version:
Linux version 2.4.9-21 (bhcompile@stripples.devel.redhat.com) (gcc
version 2.96 20000731 (Red Hat Linux 7.1 2.96-98)) #1 Thu Jan 17
14:09:42 EST 2002
[6.] A small shell script or example program which triggers the
     problem (if possible)
I have attached the sources for the client and server for my simple
test service, along with my instrumented user-level idle loop (strip
the .txt off the file names before you use them; they are ordinary C
and Java sources).  On the server machine, here is a compilation and
an example usage:
$ cc -o sserver -g sserver.c -lm
$ cc -o idle    -g idle.c
$ ./sserver 60 0 & nice ./idle 60
That invocation asks for a reporting period of 60 seconds in both the
simple server and the user-level idle loop.  The second parameter of
the server program gives the number of iterations of an inner loop
that can be used to bulk up the CPU consumption; it's not needed to
show the effect, and a value of 0 cuts it out.  The server program
reports the ephemeral port number on which it is listening for
connections; you'll need to pass that to the client program.
The client test program is written in Java.  It should compile and run
with any non-antique Java; I use IBM's JDK 1.3.0.  Put the client
source in test/client.java; here's an example of compilation and
usage:
$ javac test/client.java
$ java test.client eutil2 32800 1 10 20 25000
There "eutil2" is the name of the machine running the server, and
"32800" is the port on which it is listening (your number will vary).
"1" restricts the client to one connection at a time (necessary for
this very simple test server).  On each iteration, the client picks
(uniform random choice) a sleep time from a given interval, 10--20
milliseconds in this case.  The length of the buffer written is
specified above to be 25000 bytes.
You probably want to run the client and server on different machines;
the one time I tried them both on the same machine the period was
about 4 days.
