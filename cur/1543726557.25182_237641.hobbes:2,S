... for which the config space access code already sets the precedent --
there exist (rare) devices which have configuration registers with side
effects on reads, making it possible to produce SCSI errors or even crash
the system by just dumping the config space. Even on these devices, the
kernel does not attempt to forbid reading of these registers via sysfs.

A bug in the code is worth two in the documentation.
