Agreed. We already have an interface layer for reporting multiple
dimensions of motion control - the joystick interface. I think we really
ought to use that with some way to spot that its HDAPS etc so drivers
can decide to use it for its intended purpose (eg a different device
name scheme). The joystick compatibility would also mean it can "just
work" if you tell games to use the device.
