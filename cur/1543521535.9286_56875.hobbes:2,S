The market for 8 bit embedded processors is obviously at least as large as the
market for Celerons and Pentium IIIs, since every motherboard has an embedded
8048 keyboard controller.
Of course, the market for 8 bit embedded processors is actually many time the
size of the market for 32 and 64 bit parts, and will almost certainly still be
so in 2038. Whatever developments occur in server and desktop processors, I
don't think toasters and coffee makers are going to get a 64 processor to scan
a few switches, run a timer, and possibly cooperate through some simple mains
wiring network.
Anyone who thinks the world is moving totally to 32 and 64 bit processors
hasn't the slightest idea how high volume embedded applications are developed.
A development group might be working on a project the scrape 2 cents of the BOM
of a high volume product.
Does this have any relevance to Linux? Well, yes I think it does. I see real
potential for high volume embedded applications, on low end 16 bit processors
running a very stripped down Linux.
