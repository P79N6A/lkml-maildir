The glibc interfaces dont change according to the kernel configuration.
The kernel simply turns down PF_INET sockets and returns the appropriate
errors. So any kernel with glibc 2.1 can do AAAA record resolution and has
useful stuff like the posix getaddrinfo().

Sounds like an application design bug.
