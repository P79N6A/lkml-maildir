Yes it does but the problem continues, i still got the "hda: lost
interrupt" message and bye bye baby the system is hanged!. Now i'm using
the old hd driver ("Use old disk-only driver on primary interface->
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_HD_IDE" option) that never gave me any problems when i used
the 2.0.X
series and it is still hanging! I don't know why! and i also have to give 
it the hda=hed,cyl,sec option in order to recognises the disk it never
needed that option for the 2.0.X kernels. I tried booting with
the 2.0.36 kernel and now it hangs but with other messages and sometimes
it loses control for a while and then recovers, maybe something in the 2.2
kernel or in the programs updated (Documentation/Changes) waked up the
problem.
I have seen a driver for the HOLTEK HT6560B chip and i thought that could
be usefull to know that the MainBoard has a HOLTEK HT65521R chip (maybe it
doesn't even is an IDE chip or maybe it is) i tried to used but it didn't
worked (no wonder why).  
I have also noticed that the problem comes out when the system is running
doom or quake or compiling a huge program and any other kind of thing that
uses many resources.
I hope this problem have any solution 'cause i'm felling like i'm back in
winbugs.
I'm sending the output of "cat /proc/ide/ide0/config" again just in case
that
you haven't recived my last mail.
