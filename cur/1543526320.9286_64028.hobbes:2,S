I thought of the following: Another daemon, separate from acpid, manages
all decisions. User programs can connect to this daemon and request
temporary policy changes or notifications. This approach keeps the policy
stuff out of the kernel, so we can move acpid's functionality into the
kernel when (note I'm not writing "if") this becomes necessary.
