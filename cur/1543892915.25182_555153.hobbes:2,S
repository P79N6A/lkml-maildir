Nitbit: Sooner or later the point/unpoint should get replaced by
something with page granularity.  Something also needs to keep lists of
mapped pages and invalidate them whenever the device is written to.
That could be done in the filesystem or device driver.  I believe the
device driver would be a better solution.
