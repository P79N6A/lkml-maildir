i686, UP; egcs-19990907 + a patch for illegal salb instructions,
binutils-2.9.5.0.11; else mostly stock RedHat 6.0 + updates. (Yes, I know
this isn't a supported configuration. Don't flame; read or discard at your
discretion.)
After compiling successfully, some files had been exchanged for others
(nls_cp850.c was suddenly an executable). I thought this was just a random
accident or a leftover from ealier fallout. After a night humming along,
not doing anything really, the syslog was full of complaints about freeing
free blocks, reading after end of the device and such. After reboot, fsck
found many problems in /usr/src: duplicate blocks, files in use with dtime
set, unlinked files, seemingly files in directories named "???" (not mine!)
et al.
Caveat.
