Hello,
i am not sure if this is a kernel/module problem but so it seems to me.
My computer is an AMD 2000+ with an ABIT motherboard, my kernel version 
is 2.4.21-0.13mdk (but i tried it with 2.4.21-0.18mdk too and it doesn't 
work either).
If i give this command:
  dd if=/dev/zero of=./xxx bs=1024 count=100
it will work perfectly. But if i try to do the same reading from 
/dev/random with this command:
  dd if=/dev/random of=./xxx bs=1024 count=100
it will just sit there and stare at me until i move the mouse... and 
then the program will exit without any error message (i checked in 
/var/log/messages too and there is no message there either about this).
Is this a bug? If yes... do you have any idea that would help me fix it?
Thank you,
     Luca
