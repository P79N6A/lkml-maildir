Tough. I'm not going to commit to adding support for multiple
filehandles. The fact is that RFC3530 contains masses of rope with which
to allow server and client vendors to hang themselves. The fact that the
protocol claims support for servers that use multiple filehandles per
inode does not mean it is necessarily a good idea. It adds unnecessary
code complexity, it screws with server scalability (extra GETATTR calls
just in order to probe existing filehandles), and it is insufficiently
well documented in the RFC: SECINFO information is, for instance, given
out on a per-filehandle basis, does that mean that the server will have
different security policies? In some places, people haven't even started
to think about the consequences:
      If GETATTR directed to the two filehandles does not return the
      fileid attribute for both of the handles, then it cannot be
      determined whether the two objects are the same.  Therefore,
      operations which depend on that knowledge (e.g., client side data
      caching) cannot be done reliably.
This implies the combination is legal, but offers no indication as to
how you would match OPEN/CLOSE requests via different paths. AFAICS you
would have to do non-cached I/O with no share modes (i.e. NFSv3-style
"special" stateids). There is no way in hell we will ever support
non-cached I/O in NFS other than the special case of O_DIRECT.
...and no, I'm certainly not interested in "fixing" the RFC on this
point in any way other than getting this crap dropped from the spec. I
see no use for it at all.
