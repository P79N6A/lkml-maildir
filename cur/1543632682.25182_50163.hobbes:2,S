Hi, 
The swim3 floppy driver does not let you open the floppy device for
writing (O_RDWR) if the drive contains a write-protected floppy.  Since
the FDEJECT IOCTL works if the device has been opened read only, the
open can safely be changed to use O_RDONLY. 
This patch (against 2.4.19pre9) has been tested on an ANS (swim3), but
has not been tested using the standard floppy driver.  However, there is
a comment in the standard floppy driver code to indicate that it should
work, as shown below: 
/* Allow ioctls if we have write-permissions even if read-only open. 
 * Needed so that programs such as fdrawcmd still can work on write 
 * protected disks */ 
if ((filp->f_mode & 2) || 
    (inode->i_sb && (permission(inode,2) == 0))) 
    filp->private_data = (void*) 8; 
Cheers, 
Leigh.
