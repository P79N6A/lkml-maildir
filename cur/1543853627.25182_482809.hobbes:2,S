We're not using ->writepage().

Huh? There has never been a requirement to lock the page if all you want
to do is call set_page_writeback(). The only reason why we want to do
that at all is to allow the VM to track that the page is under I/O. All
other operations involved in scheduling writes are protected by internal
NFS locks.
