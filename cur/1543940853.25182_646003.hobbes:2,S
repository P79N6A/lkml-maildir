The patch was carelessly prepared, was not runtine-tested and was not
passed through checkpatch, which detects this error.  Please fix these
things, permanently.
It's hard to overemphasise how out-of-balance the economics are here.  You
saved maybe thirty person-seconds by skipping the review and checkpatch
steps.  But the cost (if this bug had gone into mainline) would be many
many thousands times higher than this.
