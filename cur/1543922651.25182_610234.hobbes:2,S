Yes, when using cpusets for resource control.  If memory pressure is being 
felt for that cpuset and additional mems are added to alleviate possible 
OOM conditions, it is insufficient to allow tasks within that cpuset to 
continue using memory policies that prohibit them from taking advantage of 
the extra memory.
The best remedy for that situation is to give the cpuset owner the option 
of allowing tasks with MPOL_INTERLEAVE policies to always interleave over 
the entire set of available mems so they can be dynamically expanded and 
contracted at will without triggering OOM conditions.
