  I think the delays in the driver *were* just working around PCI posting 
effects.  I tested by removing all the delays and instead putting 
something like:
        writew(val, addr);
        (void) read(addr);
instead, to flush the PCI cache.  Things seem to be happy. 
Is this the best way to make sure the PCI cache is flushed for writes that 
need to happen immediately?  I don't see many other drivers doing it...
