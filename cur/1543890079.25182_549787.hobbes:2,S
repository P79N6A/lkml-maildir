Subject: RTC_DRV_CMOS can break userspace interface

f5f72b46c349fefcfd4421b2213c6ffb324c5e56 appears to break the userspace 
interface to the CMOS alarm. This could previously be accessed via 
/proc/acpi/alarm, but if RTC_DRV_CMOS is enabled that vanishes. The help 
text for the module doesn't mention this, which makes tracking it down a 
touch irritating.
I'm not actually sure why this is the case. It doesn't look like the two 
interfaces are fundamentally incompatible. I agree that removing the 
proc code is a good long-term aim, but it'd be nice to be able to test 
the new RTC code without removing existing functionality.
(It doesn't really help that rtc-cmos doesn't load on this machine, but 
I'll try to track that down later - right now I suspect some sort of PNP 
issue)
