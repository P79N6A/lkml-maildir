Big mouth'o mine :-| 
Let me re-phrase then: it is a must have only on PI, to make sure 
you don't have a loop when doing it. Maybe is a consequence of the
algorithm I chose. -However- it should be possible to disable it
in cases where you are reasonably sure it won't happen (such as
kernel code). In any case, AFAIR, I still did not implement it.
Was this more useful?
