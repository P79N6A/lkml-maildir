Yeah I figured. Screw this legacy tech... Anyway here is the patch
for that printk:
---
Subject: Fix debug output of ark3116
Fix debug output. Previously, it would output "0xFFFFFFB0" on 32-bit 
archs (and probably "0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFB0" on 64-bits), because buf is 
taken as signed char, which is promoted to signed int, while %x always 
expects an unsigned int.
