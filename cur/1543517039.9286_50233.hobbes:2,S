There isn't. When I rewrote the inode allocation from scratch I got rid of
such stuff. Now the icache gets shrunk only when the memory goes low and
now the icache is populated only by _caching_ entities.

You aren't missing nothing, it's SMP-safe and can be safely called without
the big kernel lock.
