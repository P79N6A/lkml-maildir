I would like to perform more PCMCIA/Cardbus testing
on a wider array of systems.  I am considering buying
a Ratoc Cardbus PC Adapter (model number CBS51U).
Here are the specs:
	PCI-CardBus Bridge adapter board
	Allows CardBus PC Cards to be shared by both portable and desktop PC.
	Supplied ISA-IRQ routing board allows you to use 16-bit PC Cards.
	Automatic detection between 16-bit and CardBus PC Card.
	ACPI support
	for PC with PCI slot/ISA slot
	Bus type : Type II CardBus
	Bus mastering : Yes
	Data Transfer Rate
	Compression : (Native/Uncompressed)
The specs mention Win98 support.  Hopefully that doesn't
mean this is some sort of "WinCardbus Reader" heap of junk.
Has anyone gotten this board or a similar one from
another manufacturer to work?
Thanks,
	Miles
