Nope. Again, this whole mentality is WRONG.
It DOES NOT WORK. No architecture does per-device interrupts portably, 
which means that you'll always see sharing. 
And once you see sharing, you have small "details" like the harddisk 
interrupt or network interrupt that the user-land driver will depend on.
Oops. Instant deadlock.

No. The point really is that it fundamentally _cannot_ work. Not in the 
real world.
It can only work in some alternate reality where you can always disable 
interrupts per-device, and even in that alternate reality it would be 
wrong to use that quoted interrupt handler: not only do you need to 
disable the irq, you need to have an "acknowledge" phase too
So you'd actually have to fix things _architecturally_, not just add some 
code to the irq handler.
