Jens, Torben,
I want to thank both of you for the time you've spent on this so far.
But, I've had to make an executive decision regarding the tower, and
that is that the SCSI LUN expander card is broken.  So, I've basically
ripped it out of the box, and will be just addressing the CD drives
in the tower by their individual SCSI target ids from here on out.
This decision came about after the following operating systems were
unable to make any sense of the tower:
SunOS
SCO
Windows 98
Windows 2000
Linux 2.2.17
I figured if _none_ of these could work with the tower, each one of
them having their own SCSI Host Adapter, it wasn't the SCSI cards or
the Operating Systems that were bad.  The only piece of electronics
in the tower was the LUN expander, so, bye bye.
Thanks again for your help to this point.
Mark Post

Okay, first of all my statement about TUR (TEST_UNIT_READY) was
bogus as this is a 2.2 kernel.
Could you try turning on some of the scsi scan debugging, so we
could have a look at the result. Also, if its possible for you,
please try eliminating different hardware (swap controller, etc.)
