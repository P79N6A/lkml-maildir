Sorry for creating confusion by what I said earlier, I do understand
exactly what cpu_exclusive means. Its just that when I started
working on this (a long time ago) I had a different notion and that is
what I was referring to, I probably should never have brought that up

And my current implementation has no such restriction, I was only
suggesting that to simplify the code.

See my other note explaining how things work currently. I do feel that
this restriction is not good
