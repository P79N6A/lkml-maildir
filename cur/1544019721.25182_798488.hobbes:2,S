Hi all,
I don't think the "rlim_infinity" patch should be reverted. Let me try
to explain why.
First, code which sets limits to RLIM_INFINITY is very bad idea and
that code is Debian specific. I downloaded original pam 0.79 (stripped):
for(i = 0; i < RLIM_NLIMITS; i++) {
	...
	int r = getrlimit(i, &pl->limits[i].limit);
	...
as you can see original pam sets limits to inherited defaults. After
code written above Debian adds their patch:
if (limits_not_defined_in_limits_conf) {
	...
	case RLIMIT_NOFILE:
	...
		pl->limits[i].limit.rlim_cur = RLIM_INFINITY;
		pl->limits[i].limit.rlim_max = RLIM_INFINITY;
	...
}
so as you can see inherited default limits are overriden to infinity.
In my opinion Debian should revert their patch which is, at least,
pretty incorrect and unsecure.
Next argument is POSIX compatibility (from setrlimit() specification):
"The value RLIM_INFINITY, defined in <sys/resource.h>, shall be
considered to be larger than any other limit value. If a call to
getrlimit() returns RLIM_INFINITY for a resource, it means the
implementation shall not enforce limits on that resource. Specifying
RLIM_INFINITY as any resource limit value on a successful call to
setrlimit() shall inhibit enforcement of that resource limit."
So kernel does what is expected. If you want "unlimited" number of
descriptors, you have it.
Please consider again where exactly problem is, if in Debian patch or
in kernel patch. From my point of view Debian patch should be
reverted, not the kernel one.
Please add me to CC, I'm not member of the list.
