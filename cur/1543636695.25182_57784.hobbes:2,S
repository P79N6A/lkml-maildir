i tried ehe eepro100 NAPI driver on linux2.4.19. the kernel was compiled successfully. but when i tested the throughput of the system,i met some problem.
i tested the system with smartbits. when the frame size is 64bytes, in the beginning the system can receive and transmit packets. but after a while, the network card would not receive and transmit packets any more. 
then with frame size bigger than 128bytes, it worked well. the throughput was improved. (but sometimes it also has some problem just like 64bytes frames).
so what's the problem? is there something wrong with the driver?
please cc. thanks.
