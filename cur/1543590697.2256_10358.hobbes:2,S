Subject: [PATCH] drivers/char/serial.c bug in ST16C654 detection
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2001/5/11/171

This fixes a bug in the autoconfig_startech_uarts function in
serial.c.  The problem is that 0's are written to the baud rate
registers in order to detect an XR16C850 or XR16C854.  This makes the
Exar ST16C654 go kablooey.  Saving and restoring the baud rate
registers after the test fixes it.
I'm assuming that the XR16C85[04] detection works as is and doesn't
need the original baud rate restored.  If I'm wrong, I'll rewrite the
patch.
