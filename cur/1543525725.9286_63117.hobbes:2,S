This was where I had to make a couple of reverse engineering decisions
in the rewrite of the generic read_prco.  I decided there were three and
maybe more modes of use:
    0) 1 page files (< 4k)
    1) more than single page files
    2) files where client controls ppos
    3) files where the client software supplies the buffer
0) is signalled in the old code by start=0. Maintained.
1) is signalled in the old code by start<page. Needs changing.
2) not entirely sure.
3) is signalled in the old code by start>=page. Yerrghhh.

At least mode 1 needs preserving!

You have access to the table of rules?  Add and maintain an offset and
len (in terms of chars of printout) for each entry.  You can do this
in a separate table, which has these two fields.  You need to print the
rule into a buffer when it is first added in order to see how long it
prints out as.

I don't see that. See above.
