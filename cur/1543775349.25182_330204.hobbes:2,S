The reasons you have to repeat yourself are (a) you lack communications 
skills and expect people to read past your insults, (b) you're just 
technically wrong in some cases, such as saying that the results would 
be different if the kernel were compiled in an unrealistic way.

s/standard/common/
I doubt that single core CPUs are going to vanish, there are too many 
power critical (heat critical) embedded applications. In many the 
response time is important but the total CPU capability isn't an issue 
while battery life or fanless operation is.
Your point that SMP operation is important is true, but I see no reason 
to think Ingo has missed that.
