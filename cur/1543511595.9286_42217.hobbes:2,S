Hi kernel hackers,
well by the way the bug was not in the kernel
but in the libc.
The man page says :
RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1  is  returned,
       and errno is set appropriately.
But the code of the libc for ptrace under i386
does a special thing with all the PEEK stuff.
There must be an absurd historical reason behind
it, nope ? :)
Sorry for the noise, the next time I'll check
further before to annoy you.
Sed.
