Is not the ubuntu or debian way to take hours to compile. Is that you
have to trim the config and enable the only modules you need for your
hardware, then a rebuild cycle could last 10-15 min.
You will spend one hour once to cut down the configuration, but then
you can reuse the .config for new kernels too with make oldconfig.
To find the minimum configuration for you hardware use lspci -v,
menuconfig help, and look at chapter 7 and 8 of Linux Kernel in a
Nutshell:

Also, pasting "lspci -n" output in the following page can be of some help:

Hope this helps.
