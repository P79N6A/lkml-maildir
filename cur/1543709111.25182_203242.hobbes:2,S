hi marcelo-
your "fix" will break readahead again for NFS.  with the ">=" as you
propose, the read ahead code will never be able to read the last page of
the file as a coalesced read, it will always be a separate 4KB read.
the problem is not the readahead code, it is the driver code that tries
to read beyond the end of the device.  my change merely exposed this
misbehavior.
so there is a broken assumption somewhere about how the index of the last
page of a file/device is computed.  i think it is a problem when the file
ends exactly on a page boundary.
alain, if you don't use the NFS client, marcelo's fix should work just
fine for you.  but i believe that in general it is incorrect.
