IBM stuff may have been expensive.
There was gcc for os/2 though, which was nice for hobbyists.
The way I remember it, drivers wasn't the big problem.  The lack of drivers
could have become a problem if the lack of software was solved.  But it
wasn't - no need to drive a device for which you don't have an app . . .
Having gcc meant one could port some gpl software, which usually
originated on linux or other unixes.  But using such software on
linux was always easier, and so I switched os.
