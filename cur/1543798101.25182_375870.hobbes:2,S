This is not correct. Using interruptible_sleep_on, there is no way to 
prevent the race where the condition being waited on happens between the 
test to see if it has become true and calling interruptible_sleep_on. 
wait_event_interruptible puts the caller into the wait queue before 
testing the condition, which prevents the race.
interruptible_sleep_on is, with good reason, no longer recommended for use.
