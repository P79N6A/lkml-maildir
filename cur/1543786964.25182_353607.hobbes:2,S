Subject: [PATCH] When L3 is present show its size in /proc/cpuinfo
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/9/26/244

The code that prints the cache size assumes that L3 always lives in chipset and
is shared across CPUs. Which is not really true.
I think all the cachesizes reported by cpuid are in the processor itself. The
attached patch changes the code to reflect that.
Dave, any idea where that original comment in the code came from? Are there any
systems which reports the L3 cache size in cpuid, when L3 sits in northbridge?
Thanks,
Venki
