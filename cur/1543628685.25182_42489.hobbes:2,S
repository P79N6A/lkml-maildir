I've run into a similar problem combining ssh with IP Masquerading.  
Specificallly, IP Masquerading has a timeout: after a certain period of 
inactivity it forgets about a connection.  (It doesn't seem to clean up the 
connection and send close packets, it just silently drops it from its 
internal routing tables.)
The really FUN part is that, depending on how your firewall rules are set up, 
when you try to send a packet along an expired NAT connection it may just 
silently drop it (rather than sending back a "what, are you NUTS?" packet to 
let you know that's not a good connection anymore).
I believe the NAT Masquerading timeout defaults to 15 minutes (it probably 
has a configuration entry under /proc somewhere, but am not caffienated 
enough to remember where.  Try Documentation/filesystems/procfs.txt in the 
linux source tarball.)
It's also possible that something like "echo 600 > 
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_time" might help.  (Make keepalive timeout 
happen faster than IP masquerading timeout.)  You never know. :)
