Thanks for copying me on this. If, in the future, it seems reasonable,
I will supply a patch for the new read/write SEEPROM stuff needed for
embedded systems.
If you need to check if this device has a SEEPROM. If it doesn't,
you need to set up about 15 registers that would have been set
upon hard-reset, by the contents of the SEEPROM. Otherwise you
have a very dumb poorly performing chip.
Cheers,
