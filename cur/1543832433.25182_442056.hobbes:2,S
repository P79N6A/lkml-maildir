I would be happy for suspend2 and swsusp to coexist for at least at while. 
That's why I've made suspend2 play nicely with swsusp ever since I ported it 
to 2.6.

I just about have one. I just have one issue (the removal of name_to_dev_t by 
klibc) to address. A really simple or short-term solution would be to re-add 
it, but I want to think the issue through more carefully first.
