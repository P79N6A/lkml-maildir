1) You can do inb/outb access from userland. If you're root, you don't
   need any ioctl to issue a command that'd violate the ATA
   specification to the drive.
   Should you have any trouble programming the IDE from straigth
   userland, you can load a kernel module to help you.
   So your fix doesn't help against mailicous software (trojan horses,
   whatever).
   If the root wants to kill his system, he has much simpler ways to do
   this. 
2) I can't imagine newbie would experiment with ioctls like this. They
   usually don't know what an ioctl is.
   So it doesn't help them either.
So why all the screaming and shouting?
