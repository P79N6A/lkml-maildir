The logo.c bit I've sent out a few weeks ago so I'm just waiting for that
patch to resurface at the other end of the wormhole.
The jazzsonic breakage was caused by the not very well done "[NET]:
Introduce and use print_mac() and DECLARE_MAC_BUF()" patch aka
0795af5729b18218767fab27c44b1384f72dc9ad.
(No need to mail me about build failures of default configurations; there
is an autobuilder building them regularly ...)
