Subject: [PATCH][MIPS] Malta: Fix reading the PCI clock frequency on big-endian
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/14/354

The JMPRS register on Malta boards keeps a 32-bit CPU-endian
value. The readw() function assumes that the value it reads is a
little-endian 16-bit number. Therefore, using readw() to obtain
the value of the JMPRS register is a mistake. This error leads
to incorrect reading of the PCI clock frequency on big-endian
during board start-up.
Change readw() to __raw_readl().
This was tested by injecting a call to printk() and verifying
that the value of the jmpr variable was consistent with current
setting of the JP4 "PCI CLK" jumper.
