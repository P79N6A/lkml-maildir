I am using Debian. This is a good point. However, I have no component of
fam installed on this Debian machine at all.
And why does the eject command work? I decided to strace it to see where
it gets this invalid argument from..
open("/dev/hdc", O_RDONLY|O_NONBLOCK)   = 3
ioctl(3, 0x5309, 0xbffff948)            = -1 EIO (Input/output error)
ioctl(3, FIBMAP, 0xbffff7f0)            = 0
ioctl(3, FIBMAP, 0xbffff7f0)            = 0
ioctl(3, FIBMAP, 0xbffff7f0)            = 0
ioctl(3, BLKRRPART, 0xbffff7f0)         = -1 EINVAL (Invalid argument)
ioctl(3, FDEJECT, 0xbffff948)           = -1 EINVAL (Invalid argument)
ioctl(3, SNDCTL_MIDI_MPUMODE, 0xbffff900) = -1 EINVAL (Invalid argument)
It wasn't as revealing as I thought it would be, but does this mean
anything to someone more knowledgeable than I?
Note that as mentioned in a previous message, eject _does_ eject the CD.
