No, snd_pcm_suspend_all() must be called.  All PCM streams are
supposed to be moved to SUSPENDED state when the suspend happens.
Keeping other states doesn't guaratee the proper resume process.
The problem of ali5451 driver was that it forgot to call
snd_power_change_state() at the end of suspend callback.
This was already fixed.
So, don't apply this patch, please.
