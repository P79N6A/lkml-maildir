Subject: [PATCH] 2.5.68 fs/ext3/super.c fix for orphan recovery error path
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/4/21/180

Stephen/Andrew, please consider applying this patch to reverse the order
of checks in ext3_orphan_cleanup() for read-only mounts and prior errors.
The problem resolved by this patch is that if a root file system has an
error recorded from a previous mount, and then (when rebooting) the orphan
recovery procedure is initiated, the recovery is correctly skipped but the
file system is incorrectly left in a writable state.
This causes the subsequent fsck to fail due to the root file system
being dirty, and then requires manual intervention to get the system
fully booted.
Thanks in advance.  -ernie
