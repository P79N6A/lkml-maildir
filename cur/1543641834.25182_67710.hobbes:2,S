OK, fine, my point here is that there's no real excuse for contention on the
lru lock.  Without departing radically from the current design the most you
can possibly spend on page reclaiming is 100% of one cpu, and we ought to
simply aim at getting the most bang for the buck out of that one cpu.  It
follows that we want only one copy of shrink_cache or refill_inactive running
at a time, otherwise we're tossing away cycles spinning on locks and getting
nothing back.
If lru_cache_add is costly then we can kill both the lock contention and the
cacheline pingponging by feeding the new pages into a local list, then
grafting the whole list onto the inactive list when we start to scan.  We
want to do something like that for nonsucky readahead as well.
