In the hopes that somebody from Linksys is reading this thread, I'll add my 
$0.02.  I have one of these routers.  I'd buy a second instantly, if only I 
could build the firmware and fix some bugs in it.  I love the overall 
concept, but the buggy html interface is more than a little annoying.
Furthermore, I can think of a lot of uses for this little box, other than just 
a router.  If I had the source, I'd try some out, and if the results turned 
out as well expected, I'd make that public.  It's hard to see how this would 
be bad for Linksys.
Regards,
Daniel
