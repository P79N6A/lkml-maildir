right, access_ok deals with memory, rw_verify_area deals with files, but 
both serve a similar purpose - validating access to a region. That's why I 
thought it would make sense to have them named similarly (as they used to 
be).

Perhaps I went a tad too far, or perhaps I misunderstood the point of 
rw_verify_area(), that's certainly a possibility. In any case, it's no big 
deal, I just thought it was the logical thing to do - I'll leave it in 
Andrews capable hands to decide.
