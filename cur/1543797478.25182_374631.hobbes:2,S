ok. This is not nice since we might fail without any _real_ need. Can we
make this parameter userspace-tweakable, so that my userspace app can do
something like (pseudocode):
    echo 500 > /sys/power/swsusp/imagesize
    echo disk > /sys/power/state
    R=$?
    if [ $R -eq $ENOMEM ]; then
        echo 100 > /sys/power/swsusp/imagesize # try again
        echo disk > /sys/power/state
        R=$?
    fi
    if [ $R -ne 0 ]; then
        pop_up_some_loud_beeping_window "suspend failed!"
    fi
This would at least give us a chance for a second try. I know that Pavel
dislikes userspace tunables, but i dislike failing suspends ;-)
Best regards,
    Stefan
