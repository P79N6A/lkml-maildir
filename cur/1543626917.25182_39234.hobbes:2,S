Practically speaking System.map is often wrongly installed. Additionally
Keith Owens has (sensibly I think) refused to support this sort of
thing.

This would be OK for us, iff it was on by default. We want to avoid

Currently it's just a matter of install the module and go, which is
undeniably very useful.
