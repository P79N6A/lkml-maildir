Hey, dont forget this one:
void ipgre_err(struct sk_buff *skb, u32 info)
{
#ifndef I_WISH_WORLD_WERE_PERFECT
/* It is not :-( All the routers (except for Linux) return only
   8 bytes of packet payload. It means, that precise relaying of
   ICMP in the real Internet is absolutely infeasible.
   Moreover, Cisco "wise men" put GRE key to the third word
   in GRE header. It makes impossible maintaining even soft state for keyed
   GRE tunnels with enabled checksum. Tell them "thank you".
   Well, I wonder, rfc1812 was written by Cisco employee,
   what the hell these idiots break standrads established
   by themself???

        struct iphdr *iph = (struct iphdr*)skb->data;
