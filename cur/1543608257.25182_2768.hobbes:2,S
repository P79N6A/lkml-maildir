Sorry for followup on my own mail, but there is another thing that    
comes to my mind:                                                     
swap_out is currently in no way priority-dependant. But it could be   
(the parameter is there). How about swapping more pages in tighter    
memory situation? The basic idea is that if there is a rising need for
mem it cannot be wrong to do a bit more than under normal             
circumstances. One could achieve this simply by:                      
        int counter, nr_pages = SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX;                     
                                                                      
to                                                                    
                                                                      
        int counter, nr_pages = SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX * DEF_PRIORITY /     
priority;                                                             
                                                                      
in swap_out.                                                          
The idea behind is to reduce the overhead in finding out if swapping  
is needed by simply swapping more everytime we already gone "the long 
way to knowing".                                                      
                                                                      
Regards,
