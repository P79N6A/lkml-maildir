It also seems somewhat pointless to measure it under artificial
conditions. Interrupts happen often anyway and you probably want to
measure the effects of real drivers and kernel subsystems on the time
it takes for the blocked task to resume in userspace for real loads.
By the time you've done up custom drivers and interrupt load generators
you've completely divorced whatever you're measuring from whatever will
affect runtime in the field.
