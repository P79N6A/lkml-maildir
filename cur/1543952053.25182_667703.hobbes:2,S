The test is about using the blktrace network feature on a 64 bit s390
guest on z/VM. I don't know if 64 bit and z/VM are related to the
problem scenario, it is the only setup i tested. To reproduce, start
somewhere 'blktrace -l' as a server and issue 
blktrace -h tracehostname
dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/null
to start blktrace and some I/O load.
