Interesting.
Note that sym-2.1.9 status is probably far better than beta. I just
haven't information enough to know how reliable this driver version
actually is. FYI, I use sym-2.1.x under Linux and FreeBSD since several
months. The NetBSD port is still work in progress, but the driver works
just fine for me under this O/S too.

Would be interesting to know how cdrecord calculates the residual. It
should probably use the return value from read()/write(). Does it ?

This message is not normal given the device that for sure supports 
synchronous data transfers. I will look into this problem, first.

This one could have been triggerred by previous errors ???.

If you mean that the ncr53c8xx driver gets the same error, then the cause
can be a either common bug in sym53c8xx and ncr53c8xx, or caused by a
difference between sym53c8xx/ncr53c8xx and sym-2.1.9.
The main difference that comes to mind is that sym-2 uses the new error
handling interface but sym53c8xx/ncr53c8xx use the old one. If it is the
cause, then the sg driver might get involved in the failure.

No more than the above for now.
Will let you know if I get better ones.
