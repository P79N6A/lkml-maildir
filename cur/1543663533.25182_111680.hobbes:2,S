Some toshiba stuff seems to hide the cardbus/pcmcia and fake the attached
CD-ROM used for booting as a native IDE device. I assume this is for 
windows 95/98 installation. Vaio's do something similar but do not hide
the cardbus. When the cardbus is initialised on the vaio the magic IDE
mapping vanishes
