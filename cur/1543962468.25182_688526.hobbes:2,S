How do you know what pages have excessive errors? And how is excessive defined?
Surely you don't keep  a per page error count? It's unclear from your patch. 
Anyways I don't think this should be ia64 specific, but generic code.
I also have my doubts about making such small code subsystems modules. Modules
always get rounded to pages so it ultimatively just wastes memory.
