Albert, if you can buy a PDP-10 - do it and please, pay a shipment fee
and send it to me. I'll pay electricity bill and will port Linux to the
beast. Now, *that* will be the port of Linux to *real* hardware. Please,
find a KL-based box. KA's pager sucked boulders through the straw. SMP
KL-10 would be especially nice, but UP is OK too. Oh, if you can buy me a
TOED-1 I'ld be more than grateful. It's just $10000-$100000. Not a big
deal, right?

Or maybe you just want an Alpha. Or UltraSparc. Or XKL-10 ;-) Now,
36bit-clean UNIX would be something... AFAIK there is a port of gcc to
XKL-10, so it could be done.
