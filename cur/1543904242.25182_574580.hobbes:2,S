Hi,
IMHO, the randconfig option make no sense sometimes. For me, My
computer need some must-have config options, like SATA and USB
keyboard config options. I think many other people maybe have similar
problems.
So, what about improve the randconfig?  let's add some basic options ,
like oldconfig.   We can use randconfig based user-defined options,
randing except the pre-defined ones.
What's your opinons?
