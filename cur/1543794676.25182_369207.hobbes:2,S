Could you try hdparm tests on the two drives in parallel?
   hdparm -t /dev/hdb & hdparm -t /dev/hdd
It could be that the controller doesn't handle parallel traffic very
well.

raid0 has essentially 0 cpu overhead.  It would be maybe a couple of
hundred instructions which would be lost in the noise.  It just
figures out which drive each request should go to, and directs it
there.

The kerneltrap reference is about raid5.
raid5 is implemented very differently to raid0.
It might be worth experimenting with different read-ahead values using
the 'blockdev' command.  Alternately use a larger chunk size.
I don't think there is a de facto standard.  Many people use md.  Many
use dm.
