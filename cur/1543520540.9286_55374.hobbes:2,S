Where's this supposed to get hooked from?  In the driver sometime
long after pcibios_init?  This could get really ugly, since we
might have to re-do pci_set_bus_ranges.
I would much rather see this sort of thing somehow handled during
quirks fixup header, as then we don't have to duplicate work.

I disagree.  At issue is that those arguments are to protect allocation
on top of "magic" legacy i/o and mem regions.  Specific devices such
as IDE *will* be allocating out of that region.
