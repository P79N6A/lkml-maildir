	Andi, forgive my ignorance. I've searched around and can't seem to
find any references to IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP and how to use it. I did perform an
fgrep() and found the switch in net/ipv4/ip_socketglue.c, but where do I
implement it or how do I call it? Is this something I place in
/etc/sysconfig/network-scriptsifcfg-eth<x> file? Any help would be
appreciated.

It depends on what you want to do, but this "fix" is the same
equivalent to executing IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP twice with 2 and 3 in the
imr_ifindex field (except that the later doesn't break any programs)
