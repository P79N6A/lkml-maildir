My personnel opinion is that strength reduction should be disabled on register
limited machines like the x86 family, since the gains that come from losing the
multiply are lost due to the additional register pressure the extra register
uses.  However, I lost that battle many years ago (RMS wanted -O2 to be
consistant across machines), and have not openned it up much since then.
