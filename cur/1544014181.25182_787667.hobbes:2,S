Many thanks to Bart (and Alan) for this patch:
just what I'd been hoping for when I wrote (25 Nov)
But how to get my SD card, accessed by USB card reader, reported as NONROT?
However, may I join Kai in protesting the negative boolean flag?
I've never quite recovered from CONFIG_SCHED_NO_NO_OMIT_FRAME_POINTER;
and while this is obviously nowhere near the same league, I'd much
rather stay well away.
I don't like the "nonrot" or "rotational" at all myself: though you
may be able to advance convincing arguments why it's not accidental,
isn't the rotationality pretty much incidental to whether the seeks
are cheap?  I imagine a long bar loaded with data, which zips back
and forth through the reader: nothing rotational, but expensive seeks.
(I had been going to propose magnetic tape, but the rotation of the
spools muddies that argument.)
When doing the swap patch, though I toed the line with SWP_NONROT
for quite a while (I do dislike using different names for the same
notion at different levels), I couldn't stomach it in the end, and
went for SWP_SOLIDSTATE.
But I particularly like Sitsofe's "cheapseek".  Is that is an accurate
representation of how the I/O schedulers treat it?  then please can we
name the user-visible sysfs file accordingly?
The kernel-internal name is much less important, though I'd be pretty
happy to have CHEAPSEEK instead of NONROT throughout there too.
Oh, another problem with NONROT: flash rots a lot sooner than disk,
doesn't it?
