No, you can have a fixed port for any socket. (It's just a question whether 
you actually get the socket, because it might be in use.)
See 
http://linux01.org:2222/f/UHXT/examples/src/fastsock.c
 , which contains an 
example on how to choose a fixed port.

Looks normal to me. It might select a random port upon "libc invocation" and 
use it for all further requests. This is in fact very valid, because UDP is 
connectionless; packets can go from anywhere to anywhere without any 
pre-work.

Then, the firewall UDP implementation is broken. Note, an UDP connection *can 
not be closed*, because it never was "open". If it's trying to do something 
like 
	iptables -p udp -m state --state RELATED
it is doing it wrong, because that is an impossible situation.
