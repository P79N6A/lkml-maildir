Subject: [PATCH] Keep de2104x quiet

Jeff,
The included patch tries to keep the de2104x driver quiet if there is
link change. Without this patch, I'm getting lots of :
eth0: link up, media 10baseT-HD
eth0: link up, media 10baseT-HD
eth0: link up, media 10baseT-HD
about one a minute... Quite annoying. With this patch, the driver only
logs when state changes (which is already taken care of in
de_link_up()).
Tested on an AlphaStation-500 (21040, UP).
Thanks,
        M.
