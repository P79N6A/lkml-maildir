All right.

What exactly do you mean? In my test, files larger than a
page were handled perfectly, as well.

Is that the answer to my "sendfile is now obsolete"?
Sure we cannot remove sendfile now, as some applications
depends on it, but that's not what I wanted.
I made this patch, so that _portable_ applications (and sendfile
is miles away from beeing portable - even if the target has a
sendfile systemcall, its highly unlikely that it has the same
semantics as Linux' sendfile) are sped up.
However, I didn't like the VM waste either, but I believe there
is no other way.

Hehe. In fact that wasn't a really serious claim. My tests
were (as explicitly stated by me) done over the Loopback-
Interface. And as far as I know TUX can handle interrupts
from the network card directly, which probably makes it by
far faster.
As I neither have the time nor the infrastructure to do a real
test, I cannot really say whether TUX or my (currently unreleased)
Webserver is faster.
BTW: My webservers maps files only once, so there shouldn't be
a problem with parallel transfers.

But it worked? If I didn't misunderstood #1 then I don't see a
problem for integrating it into the current kernel.
