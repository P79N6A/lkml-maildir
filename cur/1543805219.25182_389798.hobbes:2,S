I am working on a kernel filesystem driver. I have found plenty of
documentation on
how to communicate between the VFS and the filesystem driver, but nothing
on how to communicate between the block device and the filesystem driver.
I found sb_bread() but there is no corrisponding sb_bwrite().
I presume that if ((struct superblock *)s) -> bdev is the block
device handle, but I cannot find the read/write pair of functions.
