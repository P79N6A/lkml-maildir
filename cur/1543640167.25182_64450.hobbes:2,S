Greetings Markus,
It is a fair question of which I do not have a nice answer.
I am working on fresh atapi-packet-generic engine but it is not a joy.
There are oddities like bus-phases or bus-states which their setup and
feeding of the DMA engine requires a more eligant hammer.
As much as I hate to concept of a DMA mempool, it looks like the direction
to follow.  Games such as HOST<>DEVICE || feast<>famine of buffer streams
appear to be the norm to push vast amounts of atapi-dma.  The alternative
is to have device level request queues and have the queues carry the SG or
PRD list for that portion.
I am open to suggestions for direction.
Cheers,
Andre Hedrick
