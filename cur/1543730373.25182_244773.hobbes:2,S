No, this is straight out of the memburn output (after I'd fixed the 
printf formatting strings to actually print full 8 character 
hexidecimal, but not the address of the error, thats in decimal)
I don't know enough about this to nail it to a physical address 
unforch.
And right now I have one of the two sticks pulled, trying to figure 
out which one has the tummy ache, but himem is still compiled in and 
cc1plus is going crazy, eating all ram and 500Megs of swap trying to 
build the libsmoke stuff in the new 3.3 kde.  So I'm about to reboot 
to a no himem support kernel since I only have half a Gig with just 
one stick installed, and see if that fixes cc1plus.
Thanks for asking.  I appreciate it.
