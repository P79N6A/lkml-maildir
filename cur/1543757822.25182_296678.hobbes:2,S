it is the latest Robert Love posted against -mm kernels, but in
inotify_ignore():
static int inotify_ignore(struct inotify_device *dev, s32 wd)
{
	struct inotify_watch *watch;
	int ret = 0;
	spin_lock(&dev->lock);
	watch = dev_find_wd(dev, wd);
	spin_unlock(&dev->lock); <------------- lock is released, but
	if (!watch) {
		ret = -EINVAL;
		goto out;
	}
	__remove_watch(watch, dev); <---------- must be called with lock held
out:
	spin_unlock(&dev->lock); <------------- anyway, lock is 
	return ret;                             released and sub_preempt_count
}                                               BUG's on SMP and PREEMPT
__remove_watch() must be called with ->lock held on dev.
Anyway, ->lock is released after label out.
