Well, first, failover is not all of HA. But that's a different diversion
again.

Ok.

I doubt that assessment, the DLM is going to be somewhat controversial
already and requires the dragging in of membership, inter-node
messaging, fencing and quorum. The problem is that you cannot easily
separate out the different pieces.
I'd humbly suggest to start with the changes in the VFS layers which the
CFS's of the different kinds require, regardless of which infrastructure
they use.
Of all the cluster-subsystems, the fencing system is likely the most
important. If the various implementations don't step on eachothers toes
there, the duplication of membership/messaging/etc is only inefficient,
but not actively harmful.

When you argue whether or not you can mandate quorum for a given cluster
implementation, and which layers of the cluster are allowed to require
quorum (some will refuse to even tell you the membership without quorum;
some will require quorum before they fence, others will recover quorum
by fencing), this discussion is fairly complex.
Again, let's see what kernel hooks these require, and defer all the rest
of the discussions as far as possible.

Ah, that in itself is a very data-centric point of view and not exactly
applicable to the needs of shared-nothing clusters. (I'm not trying to
nitpick, just trying to make you aware of all the hidden assumptions you
may not be aware of yourself.) Of course, this is perfectly fine for
something such as GFS (which, being SAN based, of course requires
these), but a cluster infrastructure in the kernel may not be limitted
to this.

Ah, okay.

Two-node clusters are reasonably easy, true.

Ok, this is essentially what heartbeat does, but it gets more complex
with >2 nodes. In which case your cluster block device is going to run
into interesting synchronization issues, too, I'd venture. (Or at least
drbd does, where we look at replicating across >2 nodes.)

Frankly, I'm kind of disappointed; why are you cooking up your own once
more? When we set out to write a new dependency-based flexible resource
manager, we explicitly made it clear that it wasn't just meant to run on
top of heartbeat, but in theory on top of any cluster infrastructure.
I know this is the course of Open Source development, and that
"community project" basically means "my wheel be better than your wheel,
and you are allowed to get behind it after we are done, but don't
interfere before that", but I'd have expected some discussions or at
least solicitation of them on the established public mailing lists, just
to keep up the pretense ;-)
