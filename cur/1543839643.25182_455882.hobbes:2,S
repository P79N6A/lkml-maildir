Thanks Adrian.

Andrew, there is definitely something screwed up.  If you look at
my tree this patch is already in the top changeset that was
supposedly picked up by yout pull:

    [CRYPTO] Kconfig: Added missing selects on BLKCIPHER
    Since padlock-aes and aes-s390/des-s390 now use the block cipher interface,
    they need to select the BLKCIPHER Kconfig option.
    Signed-off-by: Herbert Xu <herbert@gondor.apana.org.au>
Indeed, the s390 bits are there.  However, the padlock bits have
gong missing.  Perhaps there was a problem when it was merged with
the geode tree? This could explain why the Makefile bits for padlock
went missing too.
Cheers,
