As far as I am aware Red Hat, and most of the other vendors ship with the
win95 work around enabled as that (at least was) the normal platform, and
crashing win95 boxes would give Linux a bad name, even if it wasnt Linux
fault.
The real big problem is that the WIN95 workaround isnt a mount option. Or
better yet autodetected.
