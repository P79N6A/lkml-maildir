Registered RAM sticks look somewhat different from normal (ECC or not)
RAM sticks.  They have a few more ICs on the stick, and are usually
bigger than their normal counterparts.
(The "register" bit refers to, I believe, those buffers on the
sticks.)

If you compile a kernel without any Athlon optimizations, it should
work on the Tyan Tiger.  Try that first, and then try out the
optimizations when you've got that working.
