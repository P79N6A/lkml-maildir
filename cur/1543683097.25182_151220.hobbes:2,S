Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi all...
Here is a version of -jam just on top of mainline, instead of -aa
( jam1_m_), as bproc does not mix well with -aa. This works with bproc,
out cluster runs it now...
Anyways, vm behaviour in mainline should be far better now than time ago.
When I have the time will put again all this on top of -aa.
Novelties:
- 17-dcache-fastwalk.bz2: reduce cache bouncing while traversing paths
  already in cache. Hanna Linder <hannal@us.ibm.com>
- 19-struct_thread-pad.bz2: reorder thread info struct to kill some holes
  and reduce its size. Albert Cahalan <albert@users.sf.net>
- 34-zlib-1.1.4.bz2: zlib update and cleanup
- 50-perfctr-2.5.6-pre2.bz2: performance counter update.
- 70-i2c-2.8.0.bz2, 71-i2c-2.8.0-kbuild.bz2, 72-i2c-2.8.0-drivers.bz2,
  75-lm_sensors-2.8.0.bz2: I2C+SENSORS update to 2.8.0.
  It also includes the changes to build systems and in-kernel drivers that
  use i2c (taken from 
http://www.ensicaen.ismra.fr/~delvare/devel/i2c/
)
- 80-bproc-3.2.5-2.bz2, updated patch that could resolve some rare race.
An the usual bug-fixes, cleanups and features: O_STREAMING, -march adds,
PII split, fence ops for barriers in modern processors, CONFIG_NR_CPUS,
ext3-update-orlov-htree.
