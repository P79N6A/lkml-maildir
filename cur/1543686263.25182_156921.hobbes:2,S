With backboost, you take everything that overflows MAX_SLEEP_AVG and give 
it all to the waker... you always pull-up.  With back-theft (blech;), 
there's constant pull-up and push-down for all parties instead of only 
those who reach MAX_SLEEP_AVG, so while you'll still tend to group tasks 
which are related (the original goal of backboost), it shouldn't (wild 
theory) go raging out of control.
