Okay, maybe. But not by adding 3 new callbacks that mirror existing
functionality.

If drivers really need to know system state and reason, just put it
into pm_message_t. I wanted to add "flags" there from the begining,
serving similar purpose as your "reason".

If it is similar to PMSG_FREEZE, just pass PMSG_FREEZE and put
* sys_state  and reason into pm_message_t.

Now, here you have a point. resume() should get pm_message_t,
too. This should be rather easy to change (simple matter of coding),
and we have agreed before that it is good idea. Patches welcome.
