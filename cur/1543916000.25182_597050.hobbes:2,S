Hmm.  This is an interesting problem.  Sharing a swap file or a swap
partition with the actual swap of user space pages does seem to be
a limitation of this approach.
Although the fact that it is simple to write to a separate file may
be a reasonable compensation.

More binary size yes not more code to maintain.
As for the rest the current implementation is small enough and allows
for enough beyond hibernation I think it makes sense to eventually
merge assuming a good clean implementation can be achieved.
