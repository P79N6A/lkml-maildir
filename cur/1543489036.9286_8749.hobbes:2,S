Hi!
I hope this is the right question for this list.
I use 2.0.32 (RH 5.0)
There is a struct ifnet	*rt_ifp; in include/linux/route.h line 36. But I
cannot find the definition for this struct anywhere. Can anyone point me
to where this is defined ?
Also in struct addr in if.h, where the hell is struct iface defined?
Actually I was going thru' R. Stevens. Vol II and trying to see how Linux
TCP worked. In BSD, what it does is keeps a struct ifnet with associated
ifaddr structs. How does Linux do this?
Is there any resource onthe web which describes Linux TCP code like
Stevens' book? 
I am not subscribed to this list so pl. cc. replies to me.
