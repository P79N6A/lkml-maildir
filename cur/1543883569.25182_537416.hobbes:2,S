Have you seen/used RT? -> 
http://bestpractical.com/rt
We use it here at work and it works great.  People can report bugs  
both by email or via web interface.  We get everything that comes in  
emailed to us and we can respond by email and RT recognizes the  
responses being in the same thread and lumps them into the same bug   
(and when the origin was by email that is even without evil bug  
numbers appearing in the subject with the help of some perl scrip  
magic (aka RT action script)).  The only time I ever go into the web  
interface is about once a week to have a look at my list of open bugs  
and to do some tidying like merging bug reports and things like that.
It also has some cool features like "extract this into the FAQ" and  
there is a "FAQ" in RT that contains an autogenerated FAQ from what  
people have pulled out in that way.
Only problem is for the kernel we would need a beefy system (needs  
fast database or it gets very slow when you get into 100k+ bugs  
region) and someone who knows RT well and has a lot of spare time to  
set it up to your liking and then to maintain it...  (RT takes a  
while to set up because you can tweak just about everything and you  
can add/modify/remove functionality at will as it is very modular and  
written in Perl so pretty much anyone can adapt it to do exactly what  
they want without even needing to wait for lengthy recompiles to  
happen...)
You could for example automate sorting of bug reports into queues  
(e.g. SCSI, Net, FS, etc) by grepping the emailed bug report (or  
website generated one although on the website people can choose the  
queue by hand if they want) and sorting appropriately.  Admittedly  
for this to be at all useful someone would have to spend some time  
working out intelligent things to grep for or all bugs would match to  
all queues when they contain dmesg output for example... (-;
This might not be perfect but in comparison to bugzilla it is  
actually usable and at least we here at work like it so much we  
adopted it into our workflow voluntarily which says something...
Best regards,
	Anton
