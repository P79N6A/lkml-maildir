Because while its design center is small systems, there's
actually no technical dependency there.  The Kconfig for
EMBEDDED also says it's for disabling or tweaking standard
settings ... ergo, not *adding* subsystems or drivers.
Oddly enough, most things that work on small systems can
also be used on bigger ones.  :)
