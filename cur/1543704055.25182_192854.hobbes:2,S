That's true. And being on the linux-dvb list I can't see why they
would want to give it as a maintainer address. 
AFAIR, recently there was only one guy from convergence sending in
patches for the kernel anyway. But maybe they have some problems
within the company so they don't want to name one single person as a 
maintainer. 
Still they could give some joint mailing address. I don't think it is
necessary to discuss all patches on the list, especially since those
coming from people that are not on the list will probably be quite
trivial or more kernel related than DVB hardware related.
