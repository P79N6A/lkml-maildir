Do you really call it cross-compilation if you are working on a 32-bit linux
(Opteron driven) and try to compile a new kernel for the very same box?
I guess it should indeed be possible to recognise that at least opterons are
able to support multiple platforms. That's why I think one should be able to
select them at menuconfig rather than via make options. Sure this processor is
somehow unique, on the other hand you are as well able to compile for 386 on a
P4. I know this is not really comparable but it points roughly in the same
direction...
