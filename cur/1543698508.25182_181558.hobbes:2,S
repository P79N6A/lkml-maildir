Please. Several vendors now have 1U boxes with 2 swappable SATA
drives, and many of those vendors (e.g. supermicro) use
motherboards with the ICH5 SATA chipset.
We're about to buy a few too, and we intend to use the drivers
in RAID0 mode. The ability to swap a drive without powering down
the whole box is quite essential.
