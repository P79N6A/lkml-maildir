FWIW, I must apologize for delay with getting the damn tree open on
kernel.org ;-/   The last couple of weeks had been Not Fun(tm) in a
lot of respects.
Hopefully I'll finish putting the damn thing into publishable shape by
tomorrow.  As for the stuff mentioned above...  ro-bind series - definitely
yes, mountinfo - IMO needs a sane discussion of what and how should be shown
wrt propagation state, unprivileged mounts - in the "need to finish reviewing"
pile.
