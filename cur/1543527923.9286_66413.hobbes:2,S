Errr.....Now I'm totally confused...
From the comments made earlier, I understood this bug affected
behaviour both when mounting a Win9x share from Linux and when
mounting a Linux Samba share from Win9x. However, your comment
appears to imply that it only affects the former ???
My query was relating specifically to the latter: How does one
export a Samba share from Linux in such a way that it can be
mounted simoultaneously by both Win95 and Win98 systems?
Best wishes from Riley.
