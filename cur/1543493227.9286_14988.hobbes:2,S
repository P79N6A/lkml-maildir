Exactly.  This is an assumption I've been kind of making, but it hasn't
been said out loud enough yet.  Not to say that a few normal users might
not have a few bits set in pI...

Well, we should certainly get rid of all uid=0=special code; treatment for
fI and fE should be configurable (under /proc somewhere?), as you'll want
differnt defaults during development of a new, capability-enhanced distro.

OK, I think the min and max values are already implicit in the fI and fP,
you merely insure that neither fI nor fP is a superset of the max caps
from the get-go.  For the minimum, it's possible the binary will get caps
from fP and fI that still won't be sufficient; I say just let it fail,
much as 'chown bin myfile' always failed in the past.
cheers,
