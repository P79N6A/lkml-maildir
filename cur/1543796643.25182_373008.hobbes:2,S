None of them made it into the kernel tree.  As soon as we'll have an
acceptable one everyone will have to use and improve it.  I personally
couldn't care less what we start with.

That's because you still don't get how we do development.  The last thing
we want is full-scale rewrites.  Submit patches to fix things based on
whatever you want but do it incremental.  Anything that just moves existing
functionaly out of the place and adds duplicates with more functionality/
cleaner API/<buzzword of the day> is simply not acceptable.
