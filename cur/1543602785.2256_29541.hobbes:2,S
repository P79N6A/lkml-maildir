I have tried 2.4.9-xfs against 2.4.10-xfs with dbench.
The machine has 384 MB ram.
The throughput is roughly the same for both with dbench 2.
dbench 32 runs fine on 2.4.9-xfs but does not finish on 2.4.10-xfs.
dbench 24 will finish on 2.4.10 but it takes a very very long time.
All dbench processes are stuck in D state after 10 seconds.
I am not sure if it is the xfs part, the VM or both.
Can you give the dbench 32 a try ?
Regards
Gerold
