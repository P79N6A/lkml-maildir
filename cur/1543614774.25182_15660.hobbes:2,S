Exactly what I was thinking of: 'linux-patches@kernel.org'.  The idea is, 
instead of putting [PATCH] on your subject line and cc'ing it to Linus, you 
mail it to linux-patches with a cc to lkml if you like (depending on size of 
patch, how interesting, etc).  In any event, linux-patches will forward a 
copy to Linus.
