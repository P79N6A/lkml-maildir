Hmmm, crypto_alloc_tfm does:
        tfm = kmalloc(sizeof(*tfm) + alg->cra_ctxsize, GFP_KERNEL);
So I'm not clear on how the necessary size can be anything else at
copy time?

Either way.

Not terribly concerned about the naming, so long as the header file
makes it clear that every copy needs a matching cleanup call and not a
free.
