it could either a bug in the lowlatency patchset (likely), or a bug in the
kernel (less likely but possible). Could you remove all lowlatency changes
that are in the sync_buffers() function, or buffer.c/fs.h functions called
by sync_buffers()? It's tough to debug problems like this (apart from
considering all the changes done) - some sort of blind searching might
help. It's likely a change in fs.h or buffer.c.
the b_count++; schedule(); b_count-- solution is buggy as is but
conceptually ok - do a 'b_count++; schedule(); b_count--; goto repeat;'
and everything should be fine. (careful, there is one codepath where 'goto
repeat2;' is the correct solution because there are more loops within one
function)
