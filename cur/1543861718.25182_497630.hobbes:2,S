I think the problem is not just with CPU_DEAD. Anyone who calls
cleanup_workqueue_thread (say destroy_workqueue?) will see this race. 
Do you see any problems if cleanup_workqueue_thread is changed as:
cleanup_workqueue_thread()
{
	kthread_stop(p);
	spin_lock(cwq->lock);
	cwq->thread = NULL;
	spin_unlock(cwq->lock);
}

Ok ..yes a cpu_event_waits_for_lock() helper will help here.

I dont see as of now. I suspect we will know better when we implement
the patch to eliminate CPU_DEAD handling in workqueue.c
