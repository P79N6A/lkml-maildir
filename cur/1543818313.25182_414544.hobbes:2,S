I am assuming that this is the problem where the TSC doesn't roll over
correctly on the SC1100 and SC1200.

If that is the case, then the enable-tsc-for-amd-geode-gx-lx.patch is still
safe since the TSC on the GX and LX doesn't have that same problem.
For what its worth, we used to have a fix for the TSC issue back
in the 2.4 days that looked something like this:
#ifdef CONFIG_GEODE_SC1200
#define rdtsc(low,high) \
	__asm__ __volatile__("rdtsc" : "=a" (low), "=d" (high)); \
	if ((unsigned long) low > 0xFFFFFFFC) high--
#else
#define rdtsc(low,high) \
	__asm__ __volatile__("rdtsc" : "=a" (low), "=d" (high))
#endif
That seemed to work, but it is ugly, and I didn't bring it forward
when we moved to 2.6.  Perhaps we can revive it if there are SC1100/SC1200
users who need it.
Thanks,
Jordan
