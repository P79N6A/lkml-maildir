It turned out to be a configuration issue (as expected).  My routine of
"cp ../`uname -r`/.config .config; make oldconfig" did not do the right
thing when doing that upgrade - I ended up with
# CONFIG_CPU_FREQ_GOV_ONDEMAND is not set
CONFIG_X86_SPEEDSTEP_CENTRINO=m
CONFIG_X86_SPEEDSTEP_CENTRINO_ACPI=y
which resulted in speedstep being disabled with no obvious clues what to
do to turn it on.  After some poking, I'm now running 2.6.17-rc1-mm3
with
CONFIG_CPU_FREQ_GOV_ONDEMAND=m
CONFIG_X86_SPEEDSTEP_CENTRINO=y
CONFIG_X86_SPEEDSTEP_CENTRINO_TABLE=y
and everything is working fine.
