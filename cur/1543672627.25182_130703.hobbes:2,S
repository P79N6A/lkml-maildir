Subject: [PATCH] 2.4 devfs deadlock on concurrent lookups on non-existent entry

This problem has first been reported for over two years ago. Usually it 
happened during system boot using RH initscripts with two minilogds hanging 
on access to /dev/log and blocking rc.sysinit; this condition was triggered 
by unrelated bug in minilogd.
Pavel Roskin provided detailed debug info for this problem; details including 
stack are available at 
<
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=85621>.
 It turned out a 
deadlock between devfs_lookup and devfs_d_revalidate_wait for cases when 
->d_revalidate was called under parent->i_sem (mostly all places where 
lookup_hash was used). The deadlock looked like:
                               path_lookup("dev/log", LOOKUP_PARENT, &nd);
                                -> yields dentry for  </dev>
path_lookup("dev/log", LOOKUP_PARENT, &nd);
   -> yields dentry for  </dev>
down(</dev>->i_sem) holds i_sem
                                        down(</dev>->i_sem) - sleeps
lookup_hash("log", </dev>)                          .
devfs_lookup(</dev>, "log")                         .
   MISS                                             .
try_modload
set "log"->d_op to &devfs_wait_dops;                .
init "log"->wait_queue                              .
up(</dev>->i_sem)                                   .
                                                    .
                                             obtains i_sem
                                 lookup_hash("log", </dev>);
                                 cached_lookup(</dev>, "log", 0)
                                 devfs_d_revalidate_wait("log", 0)
                                 wait on "log"->wait_queue
                                ... waits to be waked up by devfs_lookup
down(</dev>->i_sem)
the patch fixes it by moving i_sem re-acquire after 
wake_up(&lookup_info.wait_queue). It does not look like it adds any 
additional races. Please check.
Pavel said it applies unchanged to 2.5 tree. Which may indicate it has the 
same race condition. I do not have 2.5 available.
please consider for 2.4.21
