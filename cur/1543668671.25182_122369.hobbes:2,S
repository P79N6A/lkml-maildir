Hi,
i am using radvd on my router to provide addresses for ipv6 enabled hosts.
The hosts on bootup 'ask' for an address and they receive a reply.
How do i force linux to 'ask' again?
Via sysctl? I have seen some knobs but nothing that i could use to
rediscover the address again.
(sorry, i do not remember if the correct name is neighbor discovery,
router solicitation, address autoconfiguration, or something else,
i am a ipv6 newbe)
Regards,
Maciej Soltysiak
