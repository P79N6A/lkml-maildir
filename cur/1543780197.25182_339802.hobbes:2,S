Yup, with one or two semi-exceptions, all the patches up to this series
seem to be good general cleanups - certainly it's good to move all those
open-coded asm statements into single-site inlines and macros: people keep
on screwing them up.
We do need to wake the Xen poeple up, make sure that these changes suit
them as well, or at least don't screw them over (hard to see how it could
though).

Yes this later series is in a different category and will require more
review/coordination/discussion/waking-up from the Xen team.
