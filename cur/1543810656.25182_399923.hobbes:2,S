That's not an API breakage.  The API is left untouched, the driver
now just reports the attached device as what it is.  If HAL wasn't
a piece of cargo-cult programming crap you'd see in the relevant
standards what scsi device types exist, or even better stop relying
on such low-level knowledge.  It's a disk if sd_mod attaches to it
is a much better rule than relying on lowlevel SAM details.
