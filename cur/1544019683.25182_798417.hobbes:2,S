Hi,
please could someone explain me under which circumstances a pagefault,
either generated from kernel code or from userland code, can occur on
pages which are pinned with get_user_pages()?
So far my understanding was that this can _never_ happen but I seems to
be wrong. Under high memory pressure I get PFs on such pages raised from
kernel code and the PFs are handled by do_swap_page(). When this happens,
page_count is 3 but page_mapped() returns false.
Thanks in advance,
Frank
