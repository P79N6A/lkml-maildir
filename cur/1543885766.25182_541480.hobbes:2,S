No.
I am *not* reverting that patch. The whole PCI bus-level multi-threaded 
stuff was an incredibly broken idea.
If you have problems with probing, it's not going to be about the host 
bus. It might be things like SCSI buses etc, and if somebody makes *those* 
be more threaded, I'm ok with it. But I'm not going to accept another 
broken PCI bus probe threading patch.

No. No. No. 
Probing the core bus was broken. Not "experimental". Broken. It not only 
threaded the wrogn area entirely, it also totally screwed up several 
driver subsystems (like IDE).
