  Well, I followed the logic from posix-timers.c, but it may be a poor
choice ;-)
  For a start, the SIGEV_* flags are quite confusing (for me at least).
SIGEV_SIGNAL is defined as 0, SIGEV_NONE as 1 and SIGEV_THREAD_ID as 4. I
would rather have seen SIGEV_NONE defined as 0 to avoid all this.
  I also wish I knew why those SIGEV_* constants were defined that way.

  Yep, as SIGEV_SIGNAL is 0, this in fact checks that notify is SIGEV_THREAD_ID.
It could have been written as:
	if (notify->notify == SIGEV_THREAD_ID)
  And the target pointer is always store because at this point notify is either
SIGEV_SIGNAL or SIGEV_THREAD_ID.

  Again, if it's not SIGEV_NONE, then it's either SIGEV_SIGNAL or
SIGEV_THREAD_ID.

  Could have been if (req->ki_notify.notify == SIGEV_THREAD_ID)

  No, I don't think so, notify == (SIGEV_SIGNAL|SIGEV_THREAD_ID) really means
notify == SIGEV_THREAD_ID which leaves out notify == SIGEV_SIGNAL. Or
am I grossly mistaken?
  Thanks,
