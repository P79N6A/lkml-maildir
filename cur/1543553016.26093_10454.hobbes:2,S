Go download it and try it, then come back with that smirk wiped off your face.
I'll enjoy it.....

And as I told, you, your code has nothing to do with it, it's the fact it 
goes on at all.  Ingo, go get a copy of NetWare 3.12 (I'll even send you
one -- I've got extra licensed copies), install it, put a load of 5000
connections on it, with 4 adapters.  Dual boot Linux on it, and attempt 
the same with SAMBA or MARS-NWE, and watch it oink.  
Go do it.  What's your address to I can ship you the CD's for 3.12.  Then come
back and tell me how TUX is going to solve the File and Print performance
issues in Linux.
:-)
