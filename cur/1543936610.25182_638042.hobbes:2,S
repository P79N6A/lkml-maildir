I understand your wish, but...
You told me that your plaform doesn't implement the generic gpio interface
(yet?), so this driver can't work for you.

This is not the only function to be changed, start, stop and keepalive (and
probably suspend/resume) should be changed, and when the 'Uniform Watchdog
Device Driver' will be merged, writing your driver dealing with more gpio will
be almost trivial.
Please make sure to look a the right place, the git tree for the unified
driver you have given is 17 month old... here is the latest:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/wim/linux-2.6-watchdog-mm.git;a=summary
I'm trying to get this work merged because I use it, it works for me and I'm
almost sure I haven't got the only embedded system using a max823 connected
to a gpio.
Let me know if you want some help implementing your driver!

Marc
