There are few issues we found with the user level daemon approach.
   Static binding compatibility: With the user level daemon, users can
not  
use the /proc/irq/i/smp_affinity interface for the static binding of
interrupts.
  There is some information which is only available in the kernel today,
Also the future implementation might need more kernel data. This is
important for interfaces such as NAPI, where interrupts handling changes
on the fly.
Thanks,
Nitin
