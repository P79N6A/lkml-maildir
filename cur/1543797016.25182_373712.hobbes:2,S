I don't think that having clear definitions of certain terms is playing
with words.  I don't neccessarily care which words are used, but it's
always useful to have common, well-defined terminology.
I also wouldn't call the TCP code a stack, if it hadn't all the state
engine in it.

Yes.

I did not state that it has to be replaced.  I'm much in favour of
gradual changes myself.
