I don't really understand the objection here.  Is it likely to cause
security breaches?  None of the proposed solutions seem particularly
elegant, so arguing that the current approach is a hack doesn't hold
much water with me.

Christoph, are you objecting to this behavior as well?  This seems
like the desired outcome.  Do you think there is buggy behavior here,
or do you just have issues with David's design?  Can you suggest any
alternatives of your own?
