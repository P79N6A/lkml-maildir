Hmm, not sure I'm following you, but I did try with the released
v2.6.18 (fourth stacktrace in my first email in this thread). The
2.6.13-rc3 (d94a041519f3ab1ac023bf917619cd8c4a7d3c01) version was
tested only as the result of git-bisect, and is the first kernel that
crashed in this way. But v2.6.18 crashed in a similar way as well.
Are you saying v2.6.18 should contain a fix preventing it from crashing?

Making sure my post was clear: that's what v2.6.18 + termination does.
Sorry if I misunderstood you.
