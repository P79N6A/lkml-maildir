You are playing games with semantics because you are wrong.
The code in fs/select.c about line 101, adds the current caller
to the wait-queue. This wait-queue is the mechanism by which the
current caller sleeps, i.e., gives the CPU up to somebody else.
That caller's thread will not return past that line until
a wake_up_interruptible() call has been made for/from the
driver or interface handling that file descriptor. In this manner
any number of file discriptors may be handled because the poll()
routine for each of then makes its own entry into the wait-queue
using the described mechanism.

Explained above.
