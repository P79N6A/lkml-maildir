diskdump adds polling mode disk I/O, but the polling code is tied to
the diskdump code path, so it cannot easily be used by other dump code.
It was while I was trying to generalize diskdump that I realized we
keep reinventing this particular wheel, both in kernel and user space.
diskdump only handles one device, that device cannot be used for other
dump tools and it needs special user space tools to extract the data.
As I said further down the original RFC, I am using the polling code
from diskdump but converting it to a clean API that can be used by any
dump code, as well as removing the need for special user space tools to
dig into partitions to see what has been dumped.
