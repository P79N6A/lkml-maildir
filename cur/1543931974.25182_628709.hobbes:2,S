Subject: [PATCH 2/2] DRM: i915, fix oops after killing X
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

i915, fix oops after killing X
Null sarea_priv, because next lastclose would have bad address in it if
initialization is not called in the meantime.
This is a problem in setups, where drm are closed after X starts. Next
lastclose is invoked on X kill. Newer intel drivers (2.2) with EXA support
hold the device whole time while X runs.
