Seems to me these programs needs fixing then!
You usually don't need a pseudo-random generator
at all, because you can get better random numbers
from /dev/random (or /dev/urandom) anyway.
If you really need a seed for a repeatable
pseudo-random generator, consider pulling the seed from
/dev/random.
