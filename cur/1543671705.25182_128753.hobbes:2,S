Actually, I'd like a central compression library with a large
assortment of algorithms. That way the really common code is shared
between both (or more) projects is shared.
Also, yet another unused compression algorithm hurts about as bad, as
yet another unused device driver. It just grows the kernel .tar.bz2.
