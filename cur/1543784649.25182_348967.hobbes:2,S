if it has no such limits then it indeed does!

I think you are way out of line here. James is very prudent in
separating his job at SteelEye and his maintainership.

yet you post this without having had ANY discussion or earlier reviews
in the recent months. IN fact to the outside world it looks like you sat
on this code for a long time for competative reasons and just posted it
now that Christoph is getting his layer finished.

well EMD's failure was 100% Adaptecs fault. Adaptec was warned EARLY ON
that a dmraid like solution was going to be needed. It was just that
Adaptec decided to ignore this advice (and focus only on 2.4 and ignore
2.6 entirely) that caused Adaptec to waste all the time and money on it.

so do you.

What previous maintainer?
