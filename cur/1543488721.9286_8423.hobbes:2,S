Hey stuck in wait_on_bh people,
I stuck 2.2.2ac1 on the server that was getting the wait_on_bh stuckups
and left on vacation for a week.  When I got back, the logs show that the
machine got a bunch of SCSI timeouts (around 30), which started to occur
in the first place when the motherboard was swapped (probably a dumb
problem somewhere), but also something rather interesting -- two of the
timeouts were immediately followed by wait_on_bh messages...and the box
recovered!  Perhaps something in the SCSI code was fixed?  The box has now
been up 9 days and it hasn't locked up yet.
Has anybody else noticed this as well?

If you want to try ac7 and you use aic7xxx SCSI, you may want to apply the
attached patch to revert a hunk to from the aic7xxx driver version 5.1.11
-> 5.1.12 patch that does some changes to the code that sets the
"DSCOMMAND0" register -- I needed to do this to avoid seeing even more
SCSI timeouts all over the place (but only one some revisions of the 7880
chipset).
I also attached my silly little perl script to less-painfully find stuff
in System.map when it's not in an oops format.  ksymoops probably already
does it somehow, but why not.
