Can deadlock occur here, since qstor.c is already using schedule_work()
as part of it's internal bottom-half handling for abnormal conditions?
Eg.  hotplug event -> schedule_work -> mid-layer -> queuecommand
       --> sleep  :: interrupt -> schedule_work -> deadlock?
Just checking.. we all want this to function well.
