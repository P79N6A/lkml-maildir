I had problems with the ac97 driver and newer kernels until toggling Mute 
on the headphone sense channel.  Alsa has too many bells and whistles that 
need to be properly incanted for machines to emit sound.  Just try futzing 
with the channels in alsamixer.  Otoh, that's a good way to end up with a 
config that doesn't work, too...
