Greetings!
I've been playing around with some minor tweaks to the network and disk
buffer layers of linux (kernel 2.3.99-2) to improve user-level file
serving performance by avoiding unnecessary data copies (**).  The mods
I have in mind are relatively small, but I'm not entirely sure they are
all safe.  ;-)  I'm hoping one of the kernel uberhackers on this list
can help me out with a couple of questions.....
1)  A number of the sk_buff manipulation routines (skb_push, skb_pull,
skb_reserve, etc.)  assume that the packet data pointed to by skb->data
is contiguous.  This is not the case when doing scatter/gather
communications b/w memory and a NIC.  Fortunately, it seems likely that
all of these routines are only manipulating packet headers, and
shouldn't ever go into the user-specified payload bytes (except when
doing checksums - see Q2).  Is this actually the case?  Are there other
problems that might crop up due to non-contiguous sk_buff data, either
durring data transmission or reception?
2) For incoming packets, skb->ip_summed is used to tell the network
stack that the NIC has already verified the packet's checksum.  This
flag seems to be ignored when sending packets (presumably b/c it is easy
to do the checksum while copying the packet data, so without gather
writes to the NIC it wouldn't help).  It looks like the right place to
check this flag for outgoing TCP packets would be in tcp_sendmsg, in
tcp.c.  Does anyone see any problems with this?
3) Finally, does anyone have any tips on places I should look, or
techniques I should use for better understanding the flow of control
through the network stack?  My current thought is to set up a serial
console with another machine, and use gdb to step through the network
processing, but I'd be very interested to hear if people have better
suggestions.
Thanks much!

(**) Before anyone jumps on my case for this, I _have_ read the zero
copy discussions from the list archives.  Using the SGI kernel profiling
patches, I consistently see over 50% of the cpu time spent doing copies
when I run my test app - so in _this_ case, zero copy will be a win.... 
;-)  Additionally, I _don't_ need to look at the bytes in user level, so
all of the usual page remaping tricks discussed in the research
literature are completely unnecessary, as are the complications they
entail.
