No. Let's not do that.
We ban only things that do not make sense. That was true of trying to 
share signal handlers with different address spaces. But it is _not_ true 
of having separate file descriptors for different threads.
I don't imagine anybody cares _that_ deeply about fuser that it can't 
afford to recurse into thread directories.
And it may or may not make sense to not have a "/proc/<nn>/task/<yy>/fd"
directory at all if the thread shares file descriptors with the thread 
group leader. That would be a fairly easy optimization.
