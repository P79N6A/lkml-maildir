It provides an API for remote DAV fs access, which AVFS/FUSE uses for the
dav module.  I wrote the initial DAV support, hence the reply ;)
There are some problems with it, namely that FUSE would work better with a
block-oriented GET/PUT api instead of a file-oriented one which Neon
provides.  So it should probably be replaced with calls to a HTTP client
implementation anyway, instead, at some point.
Not sure how it could be a maintainance problem, though; as long as Neon
is linked into the FUSE userspace daemon statically, it shouldn't collide
with other stuff.
