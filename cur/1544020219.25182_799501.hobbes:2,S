if there is enough value in having a variant that is guaranteed to
always run from a thread we could add that. Likely that needs that the 
caller passes in a bit of memory, but that's not too big a deal.
If there is only 1 in the entire kernel it might not be worth it,
but if it's a common pattern then for sure...
do you have a feeling on how common this is ?
