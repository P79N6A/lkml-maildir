I actually like task_t, and it is my lone typedef exception, but maybe I
am the exception...
My real complaint against typedefs (and list_t in particular) is their
inconsistent use.  I think we have done a good job universally using
task_t vs struct task_struct, and thus its not an issue to keep it... 
On the other hand, I would not scream too loudly over its removal.
Anyhow, I think any change should be ack'ed by Ingo because its his code
and he deals with it a disappropriately large amount of the time.
