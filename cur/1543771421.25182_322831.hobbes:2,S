You can change the timesource at runtime by doing something like:
echo "tsc" > /sys/devices/system/timesource/timesource0/timesource
The "*" denotes the current timesource, so you'll see it move the next
time you cat the timesource sysfs file.
Could you see if the slowness you're feeling is correlated to the
acpi_pm timesource? It is quite a bit slower to access then the TSC, but
I'd be surprised if you can actually feel the difference.
This is on an x86-64 system, correct?
thanks
