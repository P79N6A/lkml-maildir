Of course it did. "noapic" and BIOS APIC mode relate to the I/O-APIC,
not the local APIC.
My guess is that your BIOS or graphics card can't handle the local
APIC, presumably due to a crap SMM# handler or you using APM's
CPU_IDLE or DISPLAY_BLANK options.
So the solution for your board is to forcibly avoid the local APIC.
A DMI blacklist entry would do that, as would configuring the
kernel without local APIC support (!SMP && !UP_APIC).
Kernel 2.6.0-test4 supports "nolapic", so that's an option too.
I'll send that patch to Marcelo for 2.4.23-pre so it should be
in 2.4 eventually.
As for getting the DMI blacklist rule in, you or someone else
with that board has to run dmidecode and prepare & test a patch.
