Okay, perhaps I didn't clearly identify the problem last time.  The
problem is the number of messages that go into the log_buf.  On
large systems we can certainly just crank up the size of log_buf, but I
don't see this as a terribly elegant solution.
I think there should be some facility, mirroring the way we can set a
threshold for console messages, to decide if a message is logged at all.
For example, setting console_loglevel and log_loglevel (the new
threshold) to 7 results in no KERN_DEBUG messages begin printed to the
console or the log.
I'm testing a patch now, but are there any comments on the basic idea?
Is it preferrable to just crank up the size of log_buf?
