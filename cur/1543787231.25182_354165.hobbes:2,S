No, I've seen several sample cases on this list of drives where the  
IDE or SCSI cache flush commands did not trigger any disk activity  
and the only way to force it out of the cache was to write several  
meg of garbage to some file.  In some cases (Like RAID cards with  
good battery backup, for example), they may ignore the flush cache  
command as it isn't really useful (although on such good cards, they   
usually haw a way to turn it off, too).
Cheers,
