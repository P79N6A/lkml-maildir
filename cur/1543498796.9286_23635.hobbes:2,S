It's a tradeoff.  Since we use lazy FPU saves anyway, both the fxsave and the
fnstenv are skipped by non-fpu app context switches.  On apps that do use the
FPU though, signals are an example of a bad time to do the fpu conversion in
hardware.  For example, assume apps A and B both use the fpu.  App A gets put
to sleep, app B starts plugging away on the FPU.  We would have saved the FPU
state of A already during the context switch.  If we then take an interrupt
that ends up generating a signal to App A, then we need to put the FPU state
info into the signal stack.  As a result, we have to save state of App B,
restore App A state, save the tag word (and whatever else we want) and then
copy that into the signal stack, then go from there.  Generally speaking, it
adds a good amount of overhead to the signal path and if the signal handler in
App A didn't want to do any more FPU stuff, then we would have failed on our
lazy FPU saves.  It also adds complexity.  That's why I did it the way I did. 
Better to just get the fpu save stuff out of the way and have everything at
hand instead of changing all kinds of code paths for these kinds of
save/restore/save tag word hacks.

Not possible with the various *save instructions on the PIII.  I spent many an
hour tracking this down, but using fwait with fxsave will result in a cpu
reset.  Using fstenv instead of fnstenv will result in a cpu reset (either
before or after the fxsave).  I didn't try doing an fninit, but even that
wouldn't work since you would be doing so *after* the fxsave so anything that
would get changed as a result of the fninit forcing the immediate running of
the exception handler would get lost.

That is a side effect of FSAVE, but not something we rely upon (or really need
or possibly want to be honest).  We do an fninit the first time an app uses
the FPU, so doing so here would be redundant and would preclude the ability to
leave behind a certain fpu state should we wish to.

Sure, lets take a 100+ cycle hit to restore using FXRSTOR, then take a 200+
cycle hit to do an FSAVE.  I didn't bother to measure the FNSTENV instruction,
but my guess was that the amount of effort needed to copy 28 bytes followed by
copying 80bits 8 times is less than the hit you have listed above. 
Furthermore, the way I did it gets rid of *all* fsave/frstor operations.  The
hope (and again, I didn't measure it) being that an FNSTENV and FLDENV would
be enough faster than FSAVE/FRSTOR that we would actually end up ahead in the
long run.

Hmmm...not a whole lot.  I only use 32bytes aside from the 512byte FXSAVE
struct.  FNSTENV needs 28 of those 32 bytes, and the last bit are padding
since we need 16byte alignment.  In that case you mention, the best you could
do is either not have any legacy FPU state storage space, in which case you
save 32 bytes (and are required to always do your fsave/fstenv stuff directly
into user space or onto the stack) or you can do *at best* 4 bytes better than
me by moving the fstenv space to the end of the struct so you don't have a
padding byte.  I have yet to find a way to get the tag word out of the CPU
without doing either fstenv or fsave.  So as far as I can tell, you would have
to do one of the two.

Hmmm....and when you have an app that uses the regular FP registers for
certain ops and the XMM registers for other things, how exactly does the app
know if the SIGFPE is for a regular FP op or an SSE op at the time it gets the
signal (and has to interpret that pointer)?

Are you going to flag each app that uses SSE as SSE using so that a normal FP
exception also passes an SSE struct?  If you don't, then you still have to
deal with conversions whenever you get a SIGFPE that doesn't use SSE (and for
all non-SSE using apps that expect a normal FPU save struct).  Additionally,
you have to tell the app somehow (or else the app has to try and guess what it
is by the contents of the struct, and I could see that method having problems
being deterministic).
