My experience is 100% with RH kernels, but the dump should be about 
memory size, in my case 2.5G or 4G and it is. But I did see hangs which 
resulted in the size you mention, a few k and hang.
There was a patch floating around to write a core image to a disk 
partition like Solaris, AIX, and other commercial systems, but Linus was 
opposed for some reason I remember as "I don't need this and it culd be 
dangerous" or similar. If that can be retrofitted to a current kernel it 
would be more useful than netdump, I suspect.
In any case, the short answer is that what you see is way too short, it 
sounds like the header info on config, registers, or somesuch that 
netdump sends first before the core.
