Kindly put some efforts into remembering the thread that contains e.g.
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=109347094309283&w=2
If that work (summary: introduction of hybrid objects invalidates the
existing locking scheme for directories and that had lead at least to
several user-exploitable deadlocks described in details in the same
thread; current proof of correctness is in the tree, see
Documentation/filesystems/Directory-Locking.txt and at the very least
it needs to be updated) had been done - please, give the message ID
of posting with such update.  If not - please, arrange getting it done.
