We have to do the "if (ceiling)" check in every spot where
we mask it in some way, and if it falls to zero from non-zero
due to the masking, we skip.
That gives me a mostly working kernel.
Bad news is that while lat_proc's fork and exec tests improve
dramatically, shell performance is way down on sparc64.
I'll post before and after numbers in a bit.  Note, this is
just with Hugh's base patch plus bug fixes.
