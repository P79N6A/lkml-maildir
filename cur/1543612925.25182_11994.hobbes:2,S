Yes, you do and yes, it is the right thing.  It is called only if we know
that fs is there and the only possible error here is -ENOMEM.  And in
that case we will die since mount() attempts in the loop will also fail.
Resulting in immediate panic().  Well deserved-one, at that - if you
manage to OOM before starting init...
