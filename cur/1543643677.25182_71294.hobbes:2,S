Tread with caution. Some NUMA boxes do not have synced TSC, so on those
systems your code won't work. Additionally, you code would need to take
other technologies like speedstep into account as well  Alternatively,
you might want to try using get_cycles, or some other semi-abstracted
interface, so alternative time sources could be used in the future
without having to re-write your code. I'm working on somewhat
abstracting out time sources with my timer-changes patch, so take a peek
at it and let me know if you have any suggestions. 
thanks
