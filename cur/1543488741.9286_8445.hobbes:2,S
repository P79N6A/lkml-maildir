Trivial micro optimization that is not suitable for a stable kernel patch.
Or what exactly do you want to archive with this patch, other than to
remove one jump? (which itself is fine, but for 2.3, not 2.2)

Still the unnecessary function call? 
!sock_rspace(sk) is equivalent to atomic_read(&rmem_alloc) <= sk->rcvbuf,
except that it is much slower.
I also think the change is wrong: such a deadlock you're trying to avoid
here is unusual. Unusual things are not handled in the fast path. If you
really think it is necessary add it to the "turn off fast path" check 
in tcp_data_queue - such things should be definitely handled in the slow
path. But I think it is not - see below.

Which allows a DOS - the receiver could overrun the socket buffer easily.
Better make sure that rcvbuf is never < skb->truesize (which has the 
advantage that it doesn't cost anything in critical paths too). Best would
be to make sure that the rcvbuf of every socket is always > maxmtu_of_devices
+ skb header size, but that is impractical. I think 4096 is good minimum value
and the ATM and HIPPIE people can tune it.
