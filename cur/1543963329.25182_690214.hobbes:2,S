Subject: Cannot boot any HIGHMEM kernel (kernel panic - not syncing)

This is an etch server machine with 3GB of RAM, and I seem unable to
boot into any kernel (precompiled images from the Debian and OpenVZ 
repositories, I have so far avoided to compile one myself) that has 
HIGHMEM enabled, i.e.:
zoidberg:/# dmesg | head
Warning only 896MB will be used.
Use a HIGHMEM enabled kernel.
896MB LOWMEM available.
Specifically, the only kernel image that seems to work is
linux-image-2.6.18-6-486 (or the OpenVZ version fzakernel-2.6.18-486)
Everything else seems to fail with:
Setting up standard PCI resources
ACPI: Interpreter enabled
ACPI: PCI Root Bridge [PCI0] (0000:00)
CPU 0: Machine Check Exception: 0000000000000007
Bank 3: b40000000000083b at 000000fdfc000cfc
Kernel panic - not syncing: Unable to continue
Specifically, I tried at least the following images from the Debian and
OpenVZ repositories:
config-2.6.18-openvz-k7
linux-image-2.6.18-6-686
fzakernel-2.6.18-686
fzakernel-2.6.18-686-bigmem
Now, Machine Check Exception seems to point towards a hardware error,
but not only does the 486 kernel appear to work flawlessly, the server
was perfectly happy running a self-compiled sarge kernel (with HIGHMEM)
just a couple of days ago.
Here's the processor info:

Does anybody know what the issue might be, e.g. what exactly in the 
non-486 kernels might cause the error?
Thanks,
