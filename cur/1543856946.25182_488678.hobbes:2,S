Sorry, I didn't find in your list the patches regarding the sony_acpi
driver that were present in 2.6.19-rc6-mm2. I'm talking about:
2.6-sony_acpi4.patch
sony_apci-resume.patch
acpi-add-backlight-support-to-the-sony_acpi.patch
acpi-add-backlight-support-to-the-sony_acpi-v2.patch
What is the future of these?
Thanks.
