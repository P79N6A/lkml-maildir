	I don't see skb->destructor being set in net/ipv4 (although I
see it in other net/ subdirectories).  Anyhow, I don't see why ipv4
would need to increment or decrement a module reference count every
time a packet is sent or received.  It should suffice to do so when a
file descriptor is opened or closed and when a network connection is
created or completely forgotten (if that does not necessarily happen
before the close system call returns).
