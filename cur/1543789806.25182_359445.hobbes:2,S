I cannot reproduce the bug though, so this bug probably depends on the
chipset implementation of VGA. Everything works perfectly whatever value
is written to 0x3c6, so this register is either ignored or hardwired to
0xff.

The patch is obviously correct, and makes vgacon safe from rogue apps
that sets the the palette mask register to a different value.
