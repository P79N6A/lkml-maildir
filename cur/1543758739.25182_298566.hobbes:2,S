OK, in that case, I like the names you picked.

why? Maybe some specific pci chipset might need this, but in general,
I don't see why this should be assumed.

Why? People who write device drivers already know if/when they need to
disable interrupts, and so they already disable if they need it.  
If a specific arch is using a specific pci chipset that needs interrupts 
disabled in order to get io error info, then the arch-specific 
implementation can disable interrupts in iock_clear() ... But I can't 
imagine why one would want to make this the default behaviour for 
all arches that *don't* support io error checking ... 
(on ppc64, iochk_clear() would be a no-op, and iochk_read() would
check a flag and maybe call firmware, but would not otherwise have to
fiddle with interrupts).

p.s. I would like to have iochk_read() take struct pci_dev * as an
argument.  (I could store a pointer to pci_dev in the "cookie" but
that seems odd).
