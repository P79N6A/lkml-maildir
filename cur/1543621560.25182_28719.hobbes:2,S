I recently had the Linux version of Cyclone (usenet transit server) get
unhappy and start growing load without bounds. At L.A. 60 I issued a
killall the the application (which ran on happily), then a killall (-9)
which also didn't kill the processes (there is a problems there, a process
shouldNOT keep running after ill -9!). There a "reboot" which hung, and
finally a "reboot -n" which actually rebooted the machine.
Since -n only means "do sync but don't wait" I have to think that the
problem is not that the script doesn't issue a kill, but that the kill
doesn't work. I think making the sync(2) a single pass write of current
dirty buffers is the only way to avoid stuff like this. making kill -9
work would be great too, there seems to be a long term problem with
threaded programs which are hard to kill.
Just another data point, the bug in this case is not in shutdown.
