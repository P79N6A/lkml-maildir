whoops, never mind -- if i read correctly, that particular flag bit
must be set *explicitly* when writing to /proc/sys/kernel/tainted.  i
originally thought it would be set by kernel code simply by the act of
writing to /proc/sys/kernel/tainted, and i couldn't see where that was
happening.  carry on.
