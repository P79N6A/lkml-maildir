To be fair, I just altered resier4 to use the library functions and it
was someone else who chose to use the "unsafe" version. I did flag this
up on LKML when I saw it and the resier4 people are considering
changing. 
I've since promised to send a patch changing it to use the safe version.
I'll not send a "rename to unsafe" patch for the LZO core until Andrew
decides whether to drop the unsafe version entirely or not as per your
patch. If he doesn't due to the potential use by the compressed cache
people, I will send that patch.
Cheers,
Richard
