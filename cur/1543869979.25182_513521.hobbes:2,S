As far as I can see from a quick look, the device IDs are unchanged 
(0x046d/0xc70e for the keyboard), but the report descriptor seems to 
differ from the one you have at 
http://www.holtmann.org/linux/bluetooth/logitech.html
 - that seems pretty 
sad.
What puzzles me a bit is a fact that both the bugreporters seem to state 
pretty clearly that this started happening after some update, am I right?
Or did the hardware before work all the time in the HID mode, without even 
being attempted to switch to HCI (which seems to cause the bug)?
