What if someone has written to multiple, non-contiguous regions of a page?

So, assume a page is 4096 bytes long, and there are 2048 processes that each
have write locked the even numbered bytes of the first page of a file. Once
all the locks have been acquired, the page has been flushed to disk.
Now we have a clean page. Each process then writes only one byte region that
it has locked.
Now they unlock the region.
What happens?
(btw, on another nfs client, 2048 processes have locked the odd number bytes
of the first page of the same file).
If you claim that first client doesn't overwrite the updates from the
2nd client, then I'll shut up.
