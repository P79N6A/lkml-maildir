   From another point of view you get "Don't put in the kernel what needn't
be there and write a generic input library which will provide a consistent
interface to all kinds of input devices, not depending on whether handled
in the kernel or not".

   The user either compiles the things from source, then he knows he needs
to install the gpm library and installs it or he is a dumb user using some
precompiled package and then the packaging system will notice a dependency
your library -> gpm package and will install it automatically.

   Without gpm -R the mouse simply cannot be shared between two programs.
Since most users use both gpm on the console and X for graphics, the repeater
mode is the only chance they have to get it working :-)

   With few exceptions like mouse doubleclicks and mouse/joystick
acceleration I strongly doubt accurate timestamps are of any use
-- either the application is slow and unresponsive and therefore
even timestamps won't help it to react reasonably or it's fast
and responsive and then it can measure the time itself.
   I'm not against the idea of some unified input event handling in the kernel
(actually I'm helping Vojtech with writing one :-)), but I doubt putting serial
mouse drivers in the kernel is sane as there are lots of different protocols to
handle. IMHO it's better to have a user-space daemon which parses the serial
protocols and passes all the events to the kernel which distributes them.

   Obviously false. There are even OS's with _no_ mouse support.

   What does "time when the event really occured" mean for serial mice?
Measuring the times with up-to-nanosecond accuracy has no connection
to reality -- millisecond resolution is more than accurate (especially
for serial mice which are able to transmit at most 320 events per second)
and you can easily get such precision even in a userspace process.

   Please distinguish between scan codes and key codes. Scan codes are
sent directly by the keyboard, are strongly hardware dependent and vary
with settings of the keyboard and keyboard controller. Key codes are what
you need -- i.e., real identifiers of keys, not depending on any ASCII
mapping.

   Medium raw mode provides key codes. You don't need scan codes. Actually,
nobody needs scan codes.

   Neither you can with the kernel. Imagine somebody running kernel 1.2.13.
