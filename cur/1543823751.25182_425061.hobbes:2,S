Right. We have very good experience with tslib. The kdrive xserver
supports it and we recently added tslib support to Qt/Embedded (Opie)
and to Evas (EFL).

ts_calibrate does a good job. It's pretty easy to use the calibration
API and we have added customized calibration utilities in Opie, GPE and
E to make the calibration phase match the look and feel with the main
GUI.

I agree.
