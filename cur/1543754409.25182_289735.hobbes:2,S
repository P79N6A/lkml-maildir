I think the generic scatterwalk changes are more important and 
fundamental (still to be fully reviewed).
I agree with Fruhwirth that the cipher code is starting to become
ungainly.  I'm not sure these patches are heading in the right direction 
from a design point of view, although we do need the functionality.  
Perhaps temporarily drop the multible block changes above until we get the
generic scatterwalk code in and a cleaned up design to handle cipher mode
offload.
Fruhwirth, do you have any cycles to work on implementing your ideas for 
more cleanly reworking Michal's multiblock code?
Also, I would think this is more 2.6.12 material, at this stage.
