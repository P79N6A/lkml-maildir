I don't understand what could bash interfere with apt-get doing ftp
transfers, but will try it using another shell.. 
..using ash, it downloads part of the files, but fails the same way
for the rest, so I tend to agree with you but.. 
..using csh, I get the same result as ash
..using bash, I get the very same result as the other two.
Every shell is buggy and in the same way? I hardly believe it..
