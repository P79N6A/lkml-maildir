If you are talking about the numbers I quoted, those were for random
read performance.

I'll try some random write tests with write caching disabled.

NCQ will surely lessen the impact of disabling write caching, how much
still remains to be seen. You could test, if you have the hardware :)
Real life testing is more interesting than benchmarks.
