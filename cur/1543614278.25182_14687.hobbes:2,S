Yeah, it's just another abstraction layer that lives on top of native threading
model, so you don't have to worry about stuff like spinlock contention since
it's been pushed down into the native threading implementation. It doesn't really
add a tremendous amount of overhead given how delegates all of that to the
native OS threading model.
Also, t would be nice to have some regular way of doing read-write lock without
having to implement it in Java language itself, but it's not too critical since
folks don't really push or use the JVM in that way just yet. It's certainly
important in certain high contention systems in the kernel.
