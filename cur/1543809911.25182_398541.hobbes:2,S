Guess I should think a bit more and copy other code a bit less.
The two examples I looked at were sound and network devices.
While they differ by calling class_device_create more directly,
this does not call a get_device either. (Or where have I missed
it?)
I thought that parport would only exist while the device exists and
is bound to the driver, when that stops it is removed anyway.
But lp.c does not implement lp_detach, so it still keeps this data
and it is really exposed even when the device vanished.
Some unrelated strage behaviour from this: When I manualy unbind
and bind an parport supplier, via 
echo -n "id" > /sys/bus/.../drivers/.../unbind
and then echo -n "id" > /sys/bus/.../drivers/.../bind
I get a new lp device every time without the old one vanishing.
Hochachtungsvoll,
