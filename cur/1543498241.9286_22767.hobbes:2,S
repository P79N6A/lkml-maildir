Actually, NFS v3 does - it returns the error NFS_JUKEBOX.  Admittedly,
this is to handle HSM situations, not flow control.  NFS is not specified
over IL in any case, so one could write a specification which described
how flow control was to be performed.  I don't see how NFS/IL is any
worse than NFS/UDP, clients must implement their own flow control (or
not at all) for this case too.

It's hard to know without any benchmarks.  I don't have any, do you?
