Subject: kernel lockup in 2.4.5-ac3 and 2.4.6-pre7 (netfilter ?)

hello everyone !
i have had reproducible lockups in 2.4.5-ac3.
the box is a cyrix@120 mhz with a via apollo chipset and two
ethercards.
it's used as a masquerading firewall/dsl router.
now when i have an ftp session from a machine on the private network
to the internet and it gets stuck or i ctrl-c out of it, this causes
the box to lock up hard. i was able to reproduce this a few times.
no syslog entries survive. alt-sysrq-sync seems to work, but
-killall and -umount don't, so after alt-sysrq-boot i have to go
through 20gigs of fsck.
i have upgraded to 2.4.7-pre6, and the problem has reappeared, this
time when closing a stuck ssh connection. same sysrq behaviour, no
logs.
when not forwarding ftp or ssh sessions, the box has had uptimes of
more than a week, so i think the problem may be netfilter related.
see below for my netfilter setting. (the same setting has run w/o
problems in earlier 2.4 kernels.)
i'd welcome hints to nail down the problem. if you want me to run
further tests or need more info, let me know.
yours,
jörn
ps: if possible, cc: me on followups, because i only read lkml
through the archive.
