Subject: NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth0: transmit timed out on LNE100TX 4.0, kernel  2.4.2-ac11 and earlier.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

System:
AMD Athlon Thunderbird 900MHz
MSI K7T Pro (VIA KT133 chipset)
Network card: Linksys LNE100TX Rev. 4.0 (tulip)
Kernel: 2.2.18 (with 0.92 Scyld drivers), 2.4.0, 2.4.1, 2.4.2, 2.4.2-ac11
With all the above kernel revisions/drivers, my network card hangs at random
(sometimes within minutes, other times it takes days). To restart it I need
to do an ifdown/ifup cycle and it will work fine until the next hang. I
upgraded to 2.4.2-ac11 because of the documented tulip fixes, but after a
few days got this again. The error log shows:
Mar 16 18:37:00 ulthar kernel: NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth0: transmit timed out
Mar 16 18:37:00 ulthar kernel: eth0: Transmit timed out, status fc664010,
CSR12
00000000, resetting...
ad infinitum until I do ifdown/ifup. The status & CSR12 values are always
the same. My card is detected as follows by the kernel:
Mar 12 21:38:49 ulthar kernel: Linux Tulip driver version 0.9.14c (March 3,
2001
)
Mar 12 21:38:49 ulthar kernel: PCI: Found IRQ 11 for device 00:0a.0

Mar 12 21:38:49 ulthar kernel: eth0: ADMtek Comet rev 17 at 0xdc00,
00:20:78:0D:
D2:E1, IRQ 11.
Any ideas on why this might be happening?
