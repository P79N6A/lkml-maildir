 Basically correct with two "but"s. It seems that Linus has only very 
recently stated that Kai should do the work. And apparently he did not 
tell Keith very clearly how to to proceed. Also, from the qouted link:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=102304528224527&w=2
it is not clear to me whether this will lead to kbuild-2.5 "(or whatever 
subset of them you find appropriate)". So I have some sympathy for Keith 
for being impatient and worried about "his" project. Maybe things would 
calm down if Kai could state his intentions and timetable?
 While delegation of authorithy is of course Managment 101, lack of clear 
communication  is probably in the same book - high on the "NONO" and 
"popular reasons for failure" lists. (Have some experience on that. From 
both sides :-(
 And the whole community is still eagerly waiting for the timetable (as 
someone else already pointed out). I don't really care how it is done, as 
long as it is done at all and we get the 2.5 benefits before 2010 (no, 
that was for IDE :-).
