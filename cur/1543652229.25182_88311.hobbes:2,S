Another question from the point of view of unifying things. What is
wrong with
	insmod kexec
		creates /dev/kexec (or kexecfs is you are Al Viro)
		hooks the reboot and panic final notifiers
	user copies file to /dev/kexec (which stuffs it into ram)
	reboot
		kexec module handler jumps to the first page of the
		kexec data in a defined state assuming its PIC
At which point we have clearly reduced kexec/oops reporter/lkcd/netdump 
to a single common tiny interface.
