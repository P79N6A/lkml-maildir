Hello,
first a word of caution:  as I read the list only ocasionally, I'll be
quicker to answer any questions and response if you copy any reply of
this to the list to me.  Thank you.
I want to thank you for the help you have provided with my Alpha
problem.  After a lot of testing, I have been able to separate the
stability problems into two separate categories.
Category 1 is a hardware problem, pretty annoying.  Basically, if I
dare to plug in any PCI device on the same PCI-Bus as the motherboard
SCSI-Controller (a NCR 53c875 (rev 3) chip) is sitting on, the system
will crash under heavy load regardless of the kernel in use.  Since
this means that of our 6 PCI-Bus slots we will only be able to use the
single 64-Bit PCI-Slot, this is somewhat annoying.
But I have also been able to crash 2.2.7 applications under heavy
disk loads in a way that seems to be independent of this hardware
problem and that does not occur with the old 2.0.35 kernel.
Here is the relevant ksymoops info:
Options used: -V (default)
              -o /lib/modules/2.2.7/ (default)
              -k /proc/ksyms (default)
              -l /proc/modules (default)
              -m /usr/src/linux/System.map (default)
              -c 1 (default)
You did not tell me where to find symbol information.  I will assume
that the log matches the kernel and modules that are running right now
and I'll use the default options above for symbol resolution.
If the current kernel and/or modules do not match the log, you can get
more accurate output by telling me the kernel version and where to find
map, modules, ksyms etc.  ksymoops -h explains the options.
No modules in ksyms, skipping objects

3 warnings issued.  Results may not be reliable.
Once the system has crashed in this way (high disk load (do a split of
200k strips on a Gigabyte file, for example) and parallel activity are
typically needed for that), it becomes increasingly easier to cause
this error to appear that will usually cause the application under
which it occurs to Segfault.
For the record, and for perhaps helping with a suggestion about the
PCI-Bus problem, here is /proc/pci which should also tell about most
of the involved hardware.  If the grabber is pulled, this is the
setting that runs stably under 2.0.35: the problematic case appears
when a device is plugged into 32Bit Slots.  They appear on PCI Bus 1.
It is sufficient to replug the Graphics card into PCI bus 1 to cause
the system to fail under high load even when the grabber is out, and
the old 2.0.35 kernel is used.

The system is an UX4 board from Samsung.  Do you have any ideas of
whether this can be a Linux problem (PCI bridge initialization?),
somehow solved by using the setup, or whether this is most probably a
hardware problem to be solved by sending the motherboard to the
vendor?
Thanks,
