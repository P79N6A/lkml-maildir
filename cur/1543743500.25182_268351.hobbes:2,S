Yes, strictly convenience.  Most of the cases that I have seen deal with
cpu placement & cpu distances from each other. I agree that cpu-to-cpu
distances can be determined by converting to nodes & finding the 
node-to-node distance.
A second reason is symmetry. If there is a /sys/devices/system/node/node0/distance
metric, it seems as though there should also be a /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/distance
metric.
