Hell knows.  The only explanation I see (and that's not worth much) is that
we somehow confuse the chipset and get crapped on something like next cache
miss.
I'm out of ideas on that one - if you have any suggestions / questions on
details of behaviour I'll be glad to try and see what I can do, but for
now I'm reverting the probe.c patch in my tree so that I could return to
initramfs work.  Originally I thought it was a bug in my own code, but oops
is present in 2.5.40-BK and disappears in 2.5.40-BK minus probe.c changeset...
