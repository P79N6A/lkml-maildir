I wonder whether designing-in a millisecond granularity is the right thing
to do.  If in a few years the kernel is running tickless with high-res clock
interrupt sources, that might look a bit lumpy.
Switching it to a __u64 nanosecond counter would be basically free on
64-bit machines, and not very expensive on 32-bit, no?
