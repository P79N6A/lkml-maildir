I have the following patch sitting in my patch queue (since about
March).
It does what you suggest via /sys/module/md-mod/parameters/MAGIC_FILE
which is the only md-specific part of the /sys namespace that I could
find.
However I'm not at all convinced that it is a good idea.  I would much
rather have mdadm control device naming than leave it up to udev.
An in any case, we have the semantic that opening an md device-file
creates the device, and we cannot get rid of that semantic without a
lot of warning and a lot of pain.  And adding a new semantic isn't
really going to help.
We simply need to find the best way for udev and md to play together,
and I think we can achieve something quite workable.  Both sides just
have to give a bit.

Allow md devices to be created by writing to sysfs.
Until now, to create an md device, you needed to open the relevant 
device-special file.  This created a catch-22 with udev.
This patch provides an alternate.
Options include
 echo 10 > /sys/module/md-mod/paramters/create
to create legacy device with minor 10,
 echo d10 > /sys/module/md-mod/paramters/create
to create partitionable device 10<<6
 cat /sys/module/md-mod/paramters/next_free_legacy
to return major:minor device of an unused legacy array, which will exist.
 cat /sys/module/md-mod/paramters/next_free_partitionable
to return major:minor device of an unused partitionable array which will exist.
