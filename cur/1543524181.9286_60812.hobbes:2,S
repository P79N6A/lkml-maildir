Subject: inode leak in 2.2.14?

Hello!
   I have not seen anything about inode leaks fixed in 2.2.15pres,
   so I think I should report this.
   I sitted on my server, yesterday, and at one moment all things
   stopped working, programs complained about nonexistent libc and
   other stuff... Eventually I managed to get dmesg output,
   and found it filled by:
grow_inodes: inode-max limit reached
After I did echo '16000' >/proc/sys/fs/inode-max
thing worked again, I was curious and decided to look in /proc/sys/fs/inode-nr
I got "8150 27" from there, and there were no so much files open
eclipse:~$ cat /proc/sys/fs/file-nr
743     236     4096
So, what's going on?
After I examined logs I found that kernel gave a lot of messages about inodes
in short time:
Jan 30 18:47:30 eclipse kernel: grow_inodes: inode-max limit reached
Jan 30 18:47:30 eclipse kernel: socket: no more sockets
Jan 30 18:47:31 eclipse kernel: grow_inodes: inode-max limit reached
Jan 30 18:47:34 eclipse last message repeated 30 times
Jan 30 18:47:34 eclipse kernel: socket: no more sockets
Jan 30 18:47:41 eclipse kernel: grow_inodes: inode-max limit reached
Jan 30 18:47:41 eclipse kernel: grow_inodes: inode-max limit reached
Jan 30 18:50:01 eclipse kernel: grow_inodes: inode-max limit reached
Jan 30 18:51:19 eclipse last message repeated 23 times
Jan 30 18:51:44 eclipse last message repeated 2131 times
Jan 30 18:51:44 eclipse kernel: socket: no more sockets
Jan 30 18:51:44 eclipse kernel: grow_inodes: inode-max limit reached
Jan 30 18:51:44 eclipse kernel: socket: no more sockets
and so on...
Server in question is not loaded squid+unfsd.
Bye,
    Oleg
