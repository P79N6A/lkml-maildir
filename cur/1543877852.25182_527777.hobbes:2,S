Yep, thanks, looks good to me.  However, you say "Can't find IA32 as a mark",
but it's used in a couple of places that should also be changed:
	code_bytes	[IA32] How many bytes of object code to print in an
			oops report.
			Range: 0 - 8192
			Default: 64
and
	disable_8254_timer
	enable_8254_timer
			[IA32/X86_64] Disable/Enable interrupt 0 timer routing
			over the 8254 in addition to over the IO-APIC. The
			kernel tries to set a sensible default.
