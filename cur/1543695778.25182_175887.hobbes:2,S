*wrong* we do have a choice. why do _we_ use linux. why do _I_ use
Linux. Yes, because it gives me things and possibilites I don't have
with M$. Like the possibility to choose. if we copy everything M$ does.
we don't need to develop Linux further. plus, most of these windows cool
things are definitly not a part of the kernel anyway. eg this WinFS.
100% a user space thing with a DB.
