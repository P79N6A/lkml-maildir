There were a bunch of sata_mv fixes in git-libata-all, all of which are 
actually now in your linux-2.6.git tree.  This latest libata push gets 
sata_mv working on my 6042 card, and in the process fixes several bugs I 
found while doing the 6042 work.
Post-pull, git-libata-all is down to just a few development patches, 
none of which involve sata_mv.
In any case, one could be lazy, and simply bisect the main tree (and/or 
simply verify that the problem is gone in 2.6.16-git<today>).
