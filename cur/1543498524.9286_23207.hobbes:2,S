Hello,
Has anyone fixed this already?
init: error in loading shared libraries: libutil.so.1: failed to map
segment from shared object: Cannot allocate memory
2.3.5 and any other version works fine but 2.3.6 won't boot further than
execing init.
Is this something to do with recent mm changes in sys_brk()/do_brk() and
friends?
Regards,
Tigran.
