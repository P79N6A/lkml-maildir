Yes, I believe this is the case. When I read the processor spec
document it did not mention this but since then i found this out. I've
since changed the patch to use the VID#A voltages which is more
conservative (assuming that all of them will run at the higher voltage
okay which according to the upper voltage rating of 1.6 volts might be
okay). It would of course be preferrable to work out the the type
VID#A,B,C,D via software - not sure if this is possible.
