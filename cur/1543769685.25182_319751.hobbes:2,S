Oh well, I know that problem. :) We need to move completely away from
unmanaged kernel-forked processes in the hotplug area. SUSE 9.3 already
ships a udevd that listens only on netlink for hotplug messages
and /proc/sys/kernel/hotplug is set to "".
Hannes converted the input layer to a input_device class to get the
event through netlink. Maybe you can have a second look at it, so that
we can get that thing upstream soon to fix the last broken hotplug-user
and make hotplug_path finally private.
Thanks,
Kay
