well, when the stack backtrace was decoded and showed the call path coming
from the fp emulation, I jumped to the conclusion the FP emulation code
was broken :-)  Caldera ship a 2.2.5-based kernel, and there were changes
in 2.2.14, so I guessed I just needed to recompile.  Unfortunately,
the machine would no longer boot after I installed the new kernel,
so I guess there's some caldera-specific patches I didn't apply.
