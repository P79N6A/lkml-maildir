	Back then your email address started to bounce somehow.
	I have already forgotten the details, but when we get
	bounces (often quite a lot), we remove the offender's
	subscriptions.    We let email to somebody's domain to
	stay in VGER's queue for at least 2d12h, then it *may*
	get into kill zone, but when oldest one exceeds 3d0h,
	(it begins to bounce) the whole queue to that domain
	gets axed along the subscriptions to it.
	Do check your email address functionality.
	Use   
http://zmailer.org/mxverify.html
	Always be wary of your email environment going boinkers.
	(We see a few ISP's with systems bouncing email "just because
	 we are a bit loaded right now, we reject this, please send
	 it again if you want to reach this person ...")
	(We don't, we remove the subscription.)
