I realize that if this case happens the system is misconfigured as far
as oomthresh goes, but if this is a knob that we put in the mainline
kernel then I believe there should be some sort of emergency handling
code that takes this situation into account.  Perhaps throw some very
nasty looking log messages and then fall back to the classic OOM
killer behaviour..?
