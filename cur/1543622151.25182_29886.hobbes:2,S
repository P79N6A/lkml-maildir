Ah, you beat me to it; I was working on code very similar to this when
I got your e-mail.  I think this sort of thing will address the
problem we've been seeing on machines with more than 16 cpus or so
(IDLE_REBALANCE_TICK is too small, flooding CPUs with load_balance
requests), as well as making numa scheduling a little more efficient.
I'll see if I can make it work on our platform and let you know how it
goes.
