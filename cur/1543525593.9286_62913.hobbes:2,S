I still have to argue very much against the feature adding comment.  Not all 
features require locking, most of the time they can use the basic locking 
model already in place.
A lock protects a data structure.  If the locking model is specified nicely, 
it is also clear what linked data structures this affects, and how any of that 
is modified by reference counting.  Some cases can be a bit obtuse (i.e. 
streams), but that is just a can of worms I don't want to open.

So to answer A, I take it I should present a summary of all kernel structures 
and the locking model involved with each of them?  I conceed your point that 
one can't keep the whole thing in one's head at once, but it isn't necessary 
to do that.  The locking model can be clearly formulated and intuitive on each 
domain of objects, and that is all I was trying to say.  If it can't be done 
in a way that scales, then you should rethink that domain of objects, because 
there is probably a better approach.
I would answer b, but I don't want to get into that war.

SMP sucks for greater than 2-4 cpus.  It is way too easy to saturate the bus.  
I am talking about different architectures than SMP.

Small clusters of machines are excellent for certain applications, like web 
and media serving.  Transaction processing for enormous databases is another 
animal entirely, and I see that falling into the 4-32 CPU category.  I haven't 
seen concrete results saying this would work better on a cluster or a large 
CPU machine.

A distributed shared database can easily reach the same order of magnitude on 
the number of consistancy operations it needs to perform.  Not only that, but 
your latency on each operation is increased in a cluster.  Taking a lock can 
spin - you still have that issue in a cluster when you need private access to 
an object.  But if it doesn't spin, the overhead of taking a lock is very 
small, and releasing it is even less.
What do you have against increasing lock granularity to the point it scales up 
to 64 or so threads?
