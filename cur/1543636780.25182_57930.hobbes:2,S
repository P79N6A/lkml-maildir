I'd rather see the EVMS go in, if a choice has to be made between the
two. EVMS seems to have a lot of effort put in it, and has the
experience from the (very good) volume-managers that IBM have in OS/2
and AIX.
Afaik, EVMS supports LVM volumes. As for XFS, I'm sure an XFS module can
be produced for EVMS (then again, XFS isn't merged yet either...)
