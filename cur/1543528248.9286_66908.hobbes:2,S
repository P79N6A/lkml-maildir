Subject: [PATCH] devfs and symlinks--2.3.48
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

When you make symlinks, either by hand or with devfsd, in /dev, they
always end up with perms of lr-xr-xr-x.  I'm not sure that this is
really important, or what effect it has on programs accessing them (if
any--don't think anyone's using lstat anymore...), but it's not like any
other links in the system.  This little patch makes sure that the links
are create 'normally', with perms set to lrwxrwxrwx.
I don't know why this was the way it was, other than not wanting to type
the extra 10 or so characters, but if someone wants to explain a logical
reason why the perms should be lr-xr-xr-x, I'd be happy to listen. :) 
Otherwise, maybe we want to exercise a little consistency with the rest
of the system?  Just a thought...
