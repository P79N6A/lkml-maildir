please read the discussion that took place at the filesystem summit a couple 
weeks ago (available on lwn.net)
one of the things that they pointed out there is that as disks get larger the 
ratio of bad spots per Gig of storage is remaining about the same. As is the 
rate of failures per Gig of storage.
As a result of this the idea of only running on perfect disks that never have 
any failures is becomeing significantly less realistic, instead you need to take 
measures to survive in the face of minor corruption (including robust 
filesystems, raid, etc)
