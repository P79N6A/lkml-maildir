The obvious way to get it to compile would be to use CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS=y .
Stupid question: how do I enable this on x86_64 SMP?
I can't find it in menuconfig and if I edit .config manually my edits just
get deleted (obviously I'm doing something wrong). I've tried grepping the
source and googling, but haven't been able to find the answer.
