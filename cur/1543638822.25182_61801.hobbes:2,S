The current differentiation is a mess, which is my fault.
CONFIG_MULTIQUAD started off life as clustered apic mode,
and grew from there to be a catchall for the NUMA-Q machine.
I can't help but think this is a bad idea, with the benefit
of hindsight. So we'll try to convert everything to more
meaningful config options, where the top level "machine type"
config option turns on the support features that machine needs.
I know the following looks a little verbose, but it's fairly
straightforward, and is a lot more logical than the current,
errm ... mess.
I'll submit a patch to convert the existing code over unless
someone screams pretty loudly (and suggests a better idea ;-))
M.
PS. Looking at the below again, we probably ought to rename
the remaining CONFIG_MULTIQUAD to CONFIG_CLUSTERED_APIC or 
something ... but I'm sure I'll get lynched in the morning 
for that one.
