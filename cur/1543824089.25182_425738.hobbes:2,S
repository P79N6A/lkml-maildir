Well, yes, but as soon as you reboot and login that $PATH will be lost - you 
need to add that in your .bashrc, or profile.d/ or whatever to make it 
permanent.
I don't know what the issue is with the modules, but building against one 
version of modutils and then running system with another version will surely 
cause problems?
