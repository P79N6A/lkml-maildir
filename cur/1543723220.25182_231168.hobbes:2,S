Subject: [PATCH] [2.6] PPC64: log firmware errors during boot.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Paul,
Here's the fourth patch ... please apply.
Firmware can report errors at any time, and not atypically during boot.
However, these reports were being discarded until th rtasd comes up,
which occurs fairly late in the boot cycle.  As a result, firmware
errors during boot were being silently ignored. 
This patch at least gets them printk'ed so that at least they show 
up in boot.msg/syslog.  There are two other logging mechanisms,
nvram and rtas, that I didn't touch because I don't understand 
the reprecussions.  In particular, nvram logging isn't enabled
until late in the boot ... but what's the point of nvram logging
if not to catch messages that occured very early in boot ?? 
Please apply the patch, and discussion welcome on how nvram
logging works/should work ...
