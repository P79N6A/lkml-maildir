Yes it is because the next instruction after call will be at c0120738+5 =
c012073d = release_task+1fd. (the return address on the stack is the
address of the next instruction after the call).

Seems rather strange indeed ! Perhaps this is not the disassembled function
of the *running* kernel ? it would be good to disassemble vmlinux and ensure
that it is exactly the one currently running. I too have already lost lots
of time searching a wrong bug because I disassembled the wrong kernel, so
I'm certain it can happen even when we're very careful :-(
> free_pages can't block either. Odd.  
Marcelo, I have two questions for my own understanding :
  - free_pages does spin_lock(&zone->lock) around the while() loop.
    Considering that someone else could hold the lock (bug, etc...), it
    could block here. But my feeling is that if such a lock were kept held,
    the system would be totally frozen because everything which would want
    to free memory would get stuck (even a process exit). Am I right ?
  - would it enhance performance a bit to put a bunch of 'unlikely()' in all
    the ifs which end in BUG(), especially inside the loop ?
Regards,
Willy
