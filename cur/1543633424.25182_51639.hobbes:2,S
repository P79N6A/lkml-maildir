   One question is whether to support only one of them, or allow both.
   In either case the DMA-mapping.txt will need to touch on the issue.
Another important issue is from where do these issues originate?
This stuff rarely happens most of the time because block buffers and
networking buffers are what are fed to the chip.
I still think it is crucial that we not put this alignment garbage
into the drivers themselves.  Driver writers are going to get it
wrong or be confused by it.
