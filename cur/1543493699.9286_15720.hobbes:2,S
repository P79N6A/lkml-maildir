Ok, so I've found out the hard way that the loopback devices don't
actually allow me to do what I wanted to, which was to mount (say)
some device as /export/x and then loop /x back to /export/x
On Solaris I can continue to write to both /x and /export/x without a
problem, but it seems that the loopback code for Linux thinks it has
sole access to the device in question.
Is there any way to do what I'm trying to do (other than what I'm doing
at the moment, which is to remount /export/x under /x using NFS) ?
James.
