Thanks for the response. I figured out the problem. I included
linux/modversions.h in my makefile and now it works (silly mistake on my
part).

Hi
What System.map do you use for depmod ?
If you do a man depmod you can see that it has an algorithm
for finding the System.map. But maybe the case that 
depmod thins that your System.map is in another directory.
I think it's better to specify manually the system map
from your kernel tree (i.e. /usr/src/linux/System.map)
