I like the patch, but see two problems:
1) You convert drivers to dynamically allocated queues... who is freeing 
the queues?  unregister_blkdev?  It's a bit non-obvious to say the 
least, since you patches (for example, the first one, to stram.c) 
obviously switch blk_init_queue to dynamically allocate a queue...  but 
you do not add code to remove the final reference in modprobe.  The 
standard driver-facing API dictates that the driver calls foo_put 
itself, in the driver, rather than have it done implicitly.
2) the blk_init_queue really should change names, IMO.  The other 
subsystems in the kernel tend to use a "foo_alloc" or "alloc_foo" 
pattern when creating new objects.  blk_alloc_queue, or simply blk_alloc?
