Subject: [PATCH] [1/2] Fix some inaccurate comments in MTRR checking code
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/18/625

- is_cpu(INTEL) actually refers only to the MTRR architecture
and all AMD CPUs since K7 use the Intel MTRR architecture so the
fixup code runs on AMD too. Remove a comment claiming otherwise.
[Perhaps is_cpu should be renamed, the name is clearly confusing]
- Clarify another incorrect comment.
