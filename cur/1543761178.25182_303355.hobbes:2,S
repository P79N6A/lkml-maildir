OK OK.  No more top posting.  It's Mozilla's fault you know....  It 
steers you in the wrong direction by leaving a few lines at the top. 
Yes I'm ashamed to admit I remember when the default behavior of mail 
clients was to put the cursor at the bottom.

Hmm.  I think I built it in 2000.  Wow, time flies when you're having fun!
