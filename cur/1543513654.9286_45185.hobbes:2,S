   It looks like a regular user could cause an infinite loop in
the following section of udp_v4_get_port() through the
judicious grabbing of UDP ports.  Basically, the first 128 ports > 1023
(to put an entry in each hash table slot), and then every 128th port
up to the max port number (starting with the current value
of udp_port_rover which can be easily derived).   I think there
should be some sort of additional bounding counter on this loop.
               for(;; result += UDP_HTABLE_SIZE) {
                        if (result > sysctl_local_port_range[1])
                                result = sysctl_local_port_range[0]
                                      + ((result -
sysctl_local_port_range[0]) &
                                           (UDP_HTABLE_SIZE - 1));
                        if (!udp_lport_inuse(result))
                                break;
                }
