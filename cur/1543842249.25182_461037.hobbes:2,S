We are talking about reverting the patch that removed -ffreestanding, 
and that broke at least two architectures although it wrongly claimed 
it would have been a safe patch.
I agree that there is room for improvement at our string functions, but 
small optimizations like the ones you are mentioning are not much 
when talking about reverting a patch that is both theoretically wrong 
and has proven practically to cause problems.
