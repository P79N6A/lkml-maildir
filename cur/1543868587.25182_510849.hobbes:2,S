Hmmm...  Okay.

Actually, I don't think the locking is that hard or that complex.
	int do_coredump(long signr, int exit_code, struct pt_regs * regs)
	{
		<setup vars>
		down_read(&coredump_settings_sem);
		...
	fail:
		up_read(&coredump_settings_sem);
		return retval;
	}
And:
	static ssize_t proc_coredump_omit_anon_shared_write(struct file *file,
						    const char __user *buf,
						    size_t count,
						    loff_t *ppos)
	{
		<setup vars>
		down_write(&coredump_settings_sem);
		...
	out_no_task:
		up_write(&coredump_settings_sem);
		return ret;
	}
The same could be applied to all controls that change the coredumping
variables, in particular the sysctl for core_pattern could be wrapped so as to
remove one of the reliances on lock_kernel() and the lock_kernel pair could be
removed from do_coredump().
