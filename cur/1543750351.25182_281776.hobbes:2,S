Ok I may have got the name wrong :). What I am trying to do is to 
implement a package on linux similiar to the TreadMarks by Alan Cox et 
al. (ref. 
http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/amza96treadmarks.html
) that runs 
at kernel level instead of user level. Right now I think that inorder to 
achieve what I want to do, I have to change the code of the linux 
virtual memory manager. This is ok for academic purposes (which is my 
aim) however it severly reduces portability (it is much easier to just 
load a kernel module than to patch and recompile the kernel).
Thanks
Josef
