Subject: BUG REPORT : IPX (Novell) unstable work

I try 2.4test4 with test5pre3 patch and find problems
My stable configuration:
RedHat 6.2 (russian Black Cat modification)
kernel 2.2.13 without module support (monolyte)
KDE
no SCSI
This machine uses as workstation to acess Novell 3.12 server. Novell volume
constattly mounted to linux filesystem by ncpfs. 
There are no problems in stable configuration with 2.2.13 kernel.
I change only kernel. When I try 2.4, I find unstable work with Novell volume.
1. New kernel sometimes understand files with russian names as
directories and directories with russian names as files in Novell volume. But
the others (in russian too) are recognized correctly (screenshots attached).
2. It's strange conversion upper and low russian letters. If you
compare two screenchots you can see that some directories under 2.4 became
lowcase (from uppercase), some namese became uppercase from lowercase, and some
does not changed.
3. It,s strange limitation of access to server. I login to Novell as
supervisor, and as root to Linux. but you can see closed directiries.
4. In some Novell directories it normally go doun, but when your want to move
up by the tree, machihe  hangs. Its no reaction both on ctrl-alt-backspace
(shutdown X session) or in ctrl-alt-del. Only hard reset is avaliable.
In some Novell directories it is stable mistake (each attempt to gu up ended
by hang). In other directories it is no problems. I can't detect any regularity.
