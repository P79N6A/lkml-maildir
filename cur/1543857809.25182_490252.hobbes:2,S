No, I didn't. I'll do when I have a chance to do it. I hope that this won't
be merged until someone shows the benefit by data.
(I think this verion is better than the first one but..)
IIRC, DISCONTIGMEM + VIRTUAL_MEM_MAP shows a bit better performance than
SPARSEMEM_EXTREME. What I expect is to archive VIRTUAL_MEM_MAP performance
with SPARSEMEM.
Now, we still have chance to optimization.
- optimize pfn_valid. (I'll post this. mem_section[] will be never accessed
  in runtime by this.)
- use large-sized-page (no concrete idea, maybe to modify map/unmap func
  will work enough.)
Thanks,
