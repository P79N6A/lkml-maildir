Subject: [PATCH 24/37] ACPI: clear GPE earily in resume to avoid warning
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/31/547

From: Shaohua Li <shaohua.li@intel.com>
Wakeup GPE hasn't a handler. If system is waked up by such GPE like a
USB hotplug, I saw a lot of error reporting the GPE hasn't handler.
acpi_leave_sleep_state will clear the GPE but it's too late, we should
do it before interrupt is re-enabled.
