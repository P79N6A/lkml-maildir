These are all sound arguments but I guess there's litte one can do in a
community development process where every other developer/maintainer has a
different way of classifying and sorting code commits in the order of their
precedence/importance...

... and because of that, the more trivial it is, the faster it becomes obsolete
so when i first read the announcement on the trivial-list that patches submitted
for kernel version 2.x.n are going to be merged probably in version 2.x.n+2 or
something like that, I thought, well, hell, someone has a really nasty desire
for applying patches with fuzziness of <Really Big Number>. Or even worse,
patches which are not even applicable anymore.
But the problem is, IMHO, that the subsystem maintainers are simply swamped
with, let's say with the risk of sounding insensitive, more important work, 
 so that they just don't have the time for the trivial stuff. So, sometimes, 
there can be a situation when a trivial patch gets forgotten but if you try
thinking of an adequate solution for this not happening, you're soon going to
realize that a solution for trivial patches cannot be a trivial one:). Hell, I
don't even think that there will be a sufficient one.
