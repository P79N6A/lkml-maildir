It keeps time better than 250 when I tried it. It is not perfect but
then the PIT runs at a stupid rate so any choice is a little bit off. I
think there might be a better argument anyway for making HZ fixed at
1000 and adding a boot time parameter/sysctl value which is a "ticks
divisor", so on a server you can do
	echo "10" >/proc/sys/tick_granularity
and jiffies bumps in 10s 1/10th as often. That needs someone who
understands the maths and the behaviour of the time slew and xntp stuff
to do the job right though, and that isn't me.
