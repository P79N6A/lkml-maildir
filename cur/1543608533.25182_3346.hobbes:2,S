This is the approach I would use:
Kernel module:
 Exports a standard interface like file or terminal (or several...)
 GPL all of this work.
 Make it useful for others too - and you may sell some additional HW.
Propritary code (user application):
 Uses standard file operations - like fopen, seek, ...
 The needed headers are LGPL and thus safe.
