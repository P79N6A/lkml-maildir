Ok, this patch is far from perfect, I am happy that it finally runs that nice on
my machine.

If I understand this right you want at least wait 32 (or whatever value) ms if there was bm activity,
before it is allowed to trigger C3/C4?
I think the problem is (at least I made the experience with this particular machine)
that bm activity comes very often and regularly (each 30-150ms?).
I think the approach to directly adjust the latency to a deeper sleep state if the
average bus master and OS activity is low is very efficient.
Because I don't consider whether there was bm_activity the last ms, I only
consider the average, it seems to happen that I try to trigger
C3/C4 when there is just something copied and some bm active ?!? Therefore, it seems to happen
that triggering C3/C4 fails (sleep_ticks < 0). The value of failures is getting smaller if I increase
the limit for average bm activity before triggering C3/C4 (bm_promote_ms must be smaller than average bm activity),
but it never will reach zero.
The patch is useless if these failures end up in system freezes on other machines...
AFAIK there were a lot of freeze problems with C-states? Don't know, it works here.
The problem with the old approach is, that after (doesn't matter C1-Cx) sleep and dyn_idle_tick,
the chance to wake up because of bm activity is very likely.
You enter idle() again -> there was bm_activity -> C2. Wake up after e.g. 50ms, because
of bm_activity again (bm_sts bit set) -> stay in C2, wake up after 40ms -> bm activity...
You only have the chance to get into deeper states if the sleeps are interrupted by an interrupt, not bm activity.
I also thought about only reprogram timer if C1/C2 was successful x times and no bm activity was detected,
same mechanism as now, then only reprogram timer (dyn tick) for deeper sleep states -> like that, you
still can be sure the last x ms was no bm activity bit set before going to deep sleeps.
But I don't know how to do it.

Hmm, I can give it a shot the next days ...
You could also test whether it was bm activity here that caused the end of sleep (it should be in most cases):
	        acpi_get_register(ACPI_BITREG_BUS_MASTER_RLD, &bm_wakeup, ACPI_MTX_DO_NOT_LOCK);
		if (bm_wakeup){
			printk(KERN_INFO "Woke up from C3 from bus master activity after %d ticks\n", td);
			acpi_set_register(ACPI_BITREG_BUS_MASTER_RLD, 1, ACPI_MTX_DO_NOT_LOCK);
			/* also reset bm_sts bit ?!? */
			pr->power.bm_activity++;
		}
		else{
			printk(KERN_INFO "Did not wake up from C3 from bus master activity\n");
		}
		pr->power.bm_check_timestamp += ticks_to_jiffies(td);
Hmm I wonder what the difference is after waking up and checking for bm_rld or bm_sts bit ...
