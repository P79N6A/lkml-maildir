The problem is that you risk exactly the opposite mistake -- it's called
"anticompetitive feature lockout."  Intel would happily tell you to do
it; in fact, if you follow Intel guidelines or use their sample code it
will treat anything that isn't an Intel chip like a 486.
If any chip that claims to support CPUID level 00000001h reports
anything other than zero in this field, that chip is broken and we
should deal with it as a chip-specific bug.  At this point there are no
chips which are known to have this bug (and there are, after all, only a
finite number of chips out there.)
