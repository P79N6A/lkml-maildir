So, in summary, reiser4 will do a good job of flushing in large batches 
using large bios, and that is most of what you can do to optimize for 
large erase size.
Things that could be added: improved compression for small files, 
garbage collection based freeing of unused blocks, increasing node size 
to equal erase size.
We can add such features for a fee, or you can code them yourself and 
send us a patch.
If I am wrong about compact flashes all having hardware wear leveling so 
that FAT can be used on them, then you can add wear leveling to the list 
of features desirable.
