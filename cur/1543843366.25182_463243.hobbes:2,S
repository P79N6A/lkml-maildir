This is the crucial point. Using an INT3 at each dynamic tracepoint is
both costly and is a larger perturbation on the system under study.
Static tracepoints can be achieved by various means, including a few
NOPs to reserve space which get patched dynamically for activation. They
may also be compiled out completely. By the way, there are quite a few
tracers already in device drivers in the kernel.

Indeed, KProbes SystemTAP and LTTng are complementary and people
involved in the three projects are cooperating.

Indeed, dynamic tracepoints are like code patches, when the kernel
source changes they may or not apply to newer versions. Mainline kernel
"static" tracepoints are more like the existing 70000+ printk
statements!
