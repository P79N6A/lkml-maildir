Sorry to jump in the middle of thread... I missed the previous posts.
I have VP6, and it freezes when PS/2 mouse is unplugged and then plugged
back in.  When the mouse is pulled out, it's okey.  But, when the mouse
is plugged back in, the machine hangs.  This occurs in BP6 as well, I've
been tolded.
