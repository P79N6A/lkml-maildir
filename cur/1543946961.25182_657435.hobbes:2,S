The back pointer is implemented using missing left children. I am referring to
Don Knuth's volume 1: The art of computer programming, section 2.3.1, page 322.
Please see the threaded representation of the tree, it is compared with the
unthreaded representation.

We always look at the child, irrespective of whether it is to the right or left
to terminate our walk. Overloading them and setting a bit stating it is threaded
should not be that bad.

Why does the rb_node need to grow? We can encode the bits in the children

Sure, will experiment and see if we can bump up performance.
