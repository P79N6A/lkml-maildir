OK, interesting.  This was a build of just Linus' tree so others may get
this problem if they don't do a "make clean" or similar (as I don't).
I have now done the merge of the v4l-dvb tree in linux-next and I have had several conflicts, the worst being in the file drivers/media/Kconfig between commit 7c91f0624a9a2b8b9b122cf94fef34bc7f7347a6 ("V4L/DVB(7767): Move tuners to common/tuners") in Linus' tree and commit 9c76e847539ab7a73e82ff692862f3de9fa19ddb ("V4L/DVB(7767): Move tuners to common/tuners") in the v4l-dvb tree.  The former leaves
source "drivers/media/common/Kconfig"
while the latter removes it.  I suspect I have a bad version of the
v4l-dvb/stable tree (though I did fetch it this morning).
I managed to fix it all up to the point that it builds, though.
