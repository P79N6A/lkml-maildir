Hello!
>  1.May I expect S3 VGA card (non-vesa 2.0 cards) support for fb?
   Probably yes, there are several drivers under development. At least
for Virge there is already a driver present in current kernels, but it
works only on Amiga, so all you need to do is to port it to the PC
which shouldn't be too hard.

   GGI, at least in its present state, is not going to be included in
the kernel. Anyway, you can expect full multidisplay/multikeyboard
support and many fb enhancements to appear.
				Have a nice fortnight
