We already do that for Apple HFS. We create a fake directory for each dir
which is called .AppleDouble and contains the resource fork. It works pretty
well on the whole. rename() has some suprises and a generic unix cp command
will lose the resource fork but it works ok.

fd_open is interestingly dangerous for security unless carefully considered.
But yes it should be sat down and thought through

We already do. Have done since 1.3.something.

hfs works fine. This is a debate about an existing solved non problem. Providing
you don't want to keep the illusion intact at all levels (eg cp copying all
the forks) then its not a problem. 
The appletalk file server even knows about this so that it can put the forks
back together for a macos client.
