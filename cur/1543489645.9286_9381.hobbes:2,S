   I was under the impression ANSI C mandated a bytewise comparison.
ANSI 6.3.9 says that the operands to == and != must be one of the
following (paraphrasing, somewhat simplified):
  - both of arithmetic type
  - both pointers to compatible types
  - one any type of pointer and the other a pointer to void
  - one a pointer and the other a null pointer constant
i.e., structs aren't allowed.
On the other hand, I don't see the gcc documentation listing
comparison of structs as one of its extensions.
