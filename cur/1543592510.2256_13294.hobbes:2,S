Good spotting, I've put this into my tree ;-)

The correct fix is to create {set,clear,change}_bit{8,16,32}()
routines architectures may implement.  The comment there in eepro100.c
indicates the those defines are simply wrong for anything other than
x86, not just Alpha.

Please delete this, a proper fix is in 2.4.5, and in fact your
added NULL test will never pass now :-)

I experimented with computing the address every time on sparc64 and
the performance actually went down slightly, it turned out it's
quicker to load from an in-cache page struct member than compute the
offset each time.
It's probably not an issue on ix86, but who knows.
I have no strong opinions about the other patches ;-)
