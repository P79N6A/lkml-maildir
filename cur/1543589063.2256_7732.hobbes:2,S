Ion has already sent in a patch to Alan for this. Here it is...
Please note that if glibc is checking this return value, it will still
screw up if file->f_pos > 0x7fffffff, which can and does happen
against certain servers (particularly IRIX).
As I've said before: it is a bug for glibc to be relying on seekdir if
we want to support non-POSIX compliant filesystems under Linux.
Cheers,
