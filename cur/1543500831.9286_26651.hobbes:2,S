	Some more info :
From strichnine as root :
# cd /usr; find . -depth -print | cpio -ovB | rsh dgps6 dd of=/dev/null
The command completes normally.
From dgps6 as root :
rsh strichnine 'cd /usr; find -depth | cpio -ovB' | dd of=/dev/null
The command stops very early (as mentionned in the first post). But :
rsh strichnine 'cd /usr; find -depth | strace -o/tmp/cpio.output cpio -ovB' | dd of=/dev/null
The command continues a bit further and then stops (without ending).
So, having added 'strace -o/tmp/cpio.output' (or strace -o/dev/null)
makes things apparently go better, but now hangs after a few Mo of data
transferred.

I have to kill the command with a ^Z + kill -9 %1.
