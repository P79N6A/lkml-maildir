Hi!
On www.sf.net/projects/suspend , there's s2ram.c program for
suspending machines. It contains whitelist of known machines, along
with methods to get their video working (similar to
Doc*/power/video.txt). Unfortunately, video.txt does not allow me to
fill in whitelist automatically, so I need your help.
I do not yet have solution for machines that need vbetool; fortunately
my machines do not need that :-), and it is pretty complex (includes
x86 emulator).
Routine I'd like you to modify looks like:
        if (!strcmp(sys_vendor, "IBM")) {
                if (!strcmp(sys_version, "ThinkPad X32")) {
                        machine_known();
                        set_acpi_video_mode(3);
                        radeon_backlight_off();
                        return;
                }
        }
... so it is pretty easy (but any patches are welcome).
