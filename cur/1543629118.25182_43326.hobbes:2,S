That is, when not used together with config_numa.  When used with config_numa,
it has a second purpose: to allow ->mem_map arrays to exist on the same numa
node as the referenced pages.  The config_nonlinear patch could be extended
to handle this as well (by elaborating the definitions of virt_to_page and
phys_to_page) but I don't have plans to do that at this time.
