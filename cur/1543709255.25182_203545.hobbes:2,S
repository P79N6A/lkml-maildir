Well, they don't tell :)

I am not really suggesting a live switch capability, more like something that is 
set a boot time.

I had imagined that it would be rather like a file system.  The stub would pass 
(or it could be a global if you prefer) the index to use into an array of 
interface structures.  Something like:
struct kgdb_interface {
	void (*kgdb_in)(*char)
	:
	:
}
struct kgdb_interface kgdb_io_array[N];

I imagine that I would like this.  I would use the eth interface until required 
to use the serial.  I would rather not have to rebuild the kernel to do this....
