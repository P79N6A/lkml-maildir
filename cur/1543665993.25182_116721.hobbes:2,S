What the hell don't you understand in the fact that the remaining 10% is
USELESS DATA WITH NO VALUE WHAT SO EVER ???
Oh of course you won't trust Larry and maybe he's trying to screw you with 
that 10% by carefully crafting essential details in there so you'll end up 
being forced into buying a BK license otherwise you won't be able to make 
any sense of what happened in the source tree, or even make it compile!  
Isn't it pure paranoia?
Please, get a life.
