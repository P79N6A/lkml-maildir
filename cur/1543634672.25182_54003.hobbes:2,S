Hi All,
I am running kernel 2.4.19-pre10. I have an internal ATAPI Zip drive 
connected as primary slave to device file /dev/hdb. I want to use the 
ide-floppy driver in stead of the scsi emulation (ide-scsi), but kernel 
always picksup the ide-scsi.
Is there a way, such as kernel parameter, so that the kernel uses the 
ide-floppy in stead. Can I do things like,
hdb=floppy
or
floppy=hdb
or
hdb=ide-floppy /* <- This did not work */
Thank you all in advance,
Emre
