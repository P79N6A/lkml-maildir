Thats all well and good for devices which have their own drivers, but
thats not the case always.
the device I described is an OHCI controller, and in theory, it should
be able to use the OHCI driver in the kernel without any modification,
*as long as* the DMA API returns valid device and virtual addresses,
which, at present, it does not.
