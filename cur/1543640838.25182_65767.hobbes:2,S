hmm... isn't there an option to tell the kernel you are using a
HyperThreaded system, or is it detected on runtime?  I mean, think about
a P4 Xeon 2 way SMP - unless told otherwise the kernel will 'see' it as
a 4 way SMP box *but* the proccessors are not equel!
If for example, you have a task running and another task just woke up
and the scheduler needs to assign a CPU for it, choosing the other
'instance' of the same CPU as the already running task to run it on as
opposed to choosing one of the 'instanaces' of the other seperate CPU
seems a mistake IMHO, but the scheduler won't be able to make the
judgment because it doesn't know it is running on a SMT box at all.
Or am I missing something? :-)
Gilad.
