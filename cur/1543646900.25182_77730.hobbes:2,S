	Different people have different opinions about what "almost"
mean (see flame fest about embedeed Linux), so beware ;-)
	The bulk of the stuff that is enabled by WIRELESS_EXT is in
core/wireless.c and core/dev.c. I would find illogical that some part
of the Wireless Extension code are always in (your patch) and some
conditional (core/wireless.c). But it probably doesn't matter...
	Have fun...
