While we are discussing hugetlb, what is the official method of
identifying a hugetlb page - at the page level, not through a vma?
When taking a crash dump, hugetlb pages must be treated as user data,
not as kernel pages.  LKCD must be able to identify hugetlb pages from
the page struct, dumping cannot assume that any mm context is valid so
vma scans are out.  The identification method must work whether the
hugetlb pages are in use or not.  In 2.4 LKCD I added PG_hugetlb, but I
would prefer a test that did not require yet another PG flag.
