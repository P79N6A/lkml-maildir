Any chance to make it always visible and read-only by default with the
option of making it writable?
Exposing the module options would be very helpful.
Also showing its read/write in the sysfs directory listing would be great.
(if it doesn't already do that).
Any chance the parameter defaults (if they're not hard coded...) could be
exposed even if they're not given to the module on the command line?  (wish
list...)
