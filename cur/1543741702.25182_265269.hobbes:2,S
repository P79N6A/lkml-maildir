/proc/net/tcp in 2.4 is inherently unreliable since it doesn't use
the seqfile interface.  Your best bet is to use the tcp_diag interface
instead.  You can either do that by using the ss command from the
iproute2 suite, or you can query tcp_diag directly from C through
netlink.
The latter should be 100% reliable if you do a get instead of a dump.

It's not that it takes a long time to update /proc/net/tcp, it's
the fact that you have to read /proc/net/tcp in pieces, and when
the underlying data is changing, the 2.4 code is much more prone to
returning things twice or missing entries altogether.
