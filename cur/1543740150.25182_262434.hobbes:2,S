Hello World,
I'm about to buy a new computer and the ASUS P5GD1 mainboard looks good
for me. My questions:
It has the Intel 915P chipset. Does it work with the current Linux
kernel?
It has also SATA with ICH6R chiptset. The SATA Linux status report page
says: " "looks like ICH5" support available in ata_piix ". What does
that mean? Does it work or not?
It has also PCI Express slots. Is there any support needed from the
software or is this a hardware thing and works out of the box?
Thanks in advance and best regards
	Andreas
