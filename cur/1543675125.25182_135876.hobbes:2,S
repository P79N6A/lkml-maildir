I understand that was a generic benchmark against 2.5, not meant to
evaluate the effect of the fixed readahead (see the name of the patch
"readahead-got-broken-somehwere"). I don't see any good reason why
should Randy cripple down my tree before benchmarking against 2.5? if
something it's ok to apply some of my patches to 2.5, that's great, the
other way around not IMHO.
