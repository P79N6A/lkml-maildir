I agree that the name "kmem" lends itself to that interpretation
(and the 2.4 through 2.6.11 history shows that's not a wild idea);
but read and write of /dev/kmem have always used the kernel virtual
address as offset, so mmap of /dev/kmem should be doing the same.

Apology surely accepted, it's a confusing area (inevitably: in a driver
for mem, the distinction between addresses and offsets become blurred).
But please note, the worst of it was, that your patch comment gave no
hint that you were knowingly changing its behaviour on the "main"
architectures: it reads as if you were simply fixing it up on a
few less popular architectures where an anomaly had been missed.

Have I got it right, that actually the problem you thought you were
fixing does not even exist?  __pa was already doing the right thing on
all architectures, wasn't it?  So we can simply ask Linus to revert your
patch?  I don't think your PFN_DOWN or virt_to_phys were improvements:
though mem.c happens to live in drivers/char/, imagine it under mm/.
