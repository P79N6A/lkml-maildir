Yeah right, that latter case is _so_ much more readable, and makes it
_so_ easy for the compiler to optimise precisely when it wants to do the
byte-swapping, especially if the back end has load-and-swap or
store-and-swap instructions. :)
It's even nicer when it ends up as:
	sum = cpu_to_le16(le16_to_cpu(a) + le16_to_cpu(b));	/* Ok */
	sum |= c;
	sum = cpu_to_le16(le16_to_cpu(sum) + le16_to_cpu(d));
I'd really quite like to see the real compiler know about endianness,
too. I dare say I _could_ optimise the above (admittedly contrived but
not _so_ unlikely) case, but I don't _want_ to hand-optimise my code --
that's what I keep a compiler _for_.
