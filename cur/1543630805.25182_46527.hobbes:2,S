   I know -- that's what I mean by being more explicit.  sysdata would 
   become a pointer to struct pci_domain.
No thanks, I want to say what the layout is for
this object.  What pci_domain will end up doing is
making for one more dereference to "arch private"
state and that stinks for performance :-)
Franks a lot,
