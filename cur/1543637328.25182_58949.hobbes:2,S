Are you crazy? This routing could NEVER work; pge_page returns
a pointer to a struct page. I always was suspicious of this
technique; even if you find out how to use page_address,
what do you do about the bus address? On some architectures,
the bus address is only known to the part that manages a
north bridge; it may even be stored in hardware registers.
No matter how popular this trick is, it is highly illegal.
To work properly, your driver has to remember virtual and bus
addresses that were mapped with pci_alloc_sg. They are returned to
you for this very purpose. In most cases you have to to track I/Os 
anyway, so just add a field to whatever management structure you use.
