Commit: ef1fc2f01e02951a0d8520ec3aa0b38606d74b55

    BKL-removal: Implement a compat_ioctl handler for JFS
    
    The ioctls were already compatible except for the actual values so this
    was fairly easy to do.

Commit: baab81fa518ecfac597402b462631f5593926623

    BKL-removal: Use unlocked_ioctl for jfs
    
    Convert jfs_ioctl over to not use the BKL. The only potential race
    I could see was with two ioctls in parallel changing the flags
    and losing the updates. Use the i_mutex to protect against this.
