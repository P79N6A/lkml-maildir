Hi All,
This series of patches is my first pass in an effort to improve PCI
power management.  They are against 2.6.17-rc5.  The changes include
various PCI PM improvements and fixes, with a focus on low-level
infrastructure.  All code has been tested on a limited set of hardware,
and seems to work well, but additional testing coverage will likely be
necessary.  I look forward to any suggestions or comments.
Thanks,
Adam
