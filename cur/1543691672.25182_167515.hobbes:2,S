Kernel Version: 2.6.0-test5-bk8
I've got some problems with the D-Link DUB-C2 2Port USB2.0 PCMCIA
adaptor. If present at boot up time, the kernel hangs after initiating a
second Yenta Socket (log below).
When inserted into a running system ohci-hcd generates multiple error
messages.
Bootup - Log (hand copied):
| Yenta: CardBus Bridge fount at 0000:02:05.0 [103c:001a]
| Yenta: Enabling burst memory read transactions
| Yenta: Using INTVAL to route CSC interrupts to PCI
| Yenta: Routing CardBus interrupts to PCI
| Yenta: ISA IRQ list 0a98, PCI irq 10
| Socket status: 300000006

| Yenta: CardBus Bridge fount at 0000:02:05.1 [103c:001a]
| Yenta: Enabling burst memory read transactions
| Yenta: Using INTVAL to route CSC interrupts to PCI
| Yenta: Routing CardBus interrupts to PCI
| Yenta: ISA IRQ list 0a98, PCI irq 10
| Socket status: 300000020
[computer hangs]
Tried to disable the onboard usb controller, but the system BIOS won't
allow it (POS in question is a HP Omnibook 6100).
The error messages which could be gained by inserting the PCMCIA card
after booting are:
| cs: IO port probe 0x0c00-0x0cff: clean.
| cs: IO port probe 0x0800-0x08ff: clean.
| cs: IO port probe 0x0100-0x04ff: excluding 0x200-0x207 0x3c0-0x3df 0x4d0-0x4d7
