It's not too much to even state that almost any computer working with
Linux 2.4+ can do 800x600 or 1024x768. Anything below that can be
considered a special case, regarding the numbers out there. But that
does not influence the possibility of using a bootsplash graphics. 
On a system you can't use it properly, you probably also would not 
want it (i.e. use normal text mode boot instead of a framebuffer
driver)

Have a look at ftp.suse.com/pub/people/stepan/bootsplash/ - There you
find kernel patches, user space utilities and such to display a
bootsplash screen. You can either choose to have a picture put "behind"
your text, or have a picture _instead_ of text. (triggerable with a 
boot parameter so anybody is happy). And yes, it _does_ look cool to see
your kernel messages scrolling up on a background of a slightly faded
out penguin, looking like a water sign. ;-)

My patch above includes a small and efficient jpeg decoder (8k), which
allows you to read any jpg picture from an initrd.

It's not alien, and it does make sense. I, speaking for myself, know the
kernel boot messages by heart and I don't expect them to change with the
2957596. bootup of my linux box. ;)
Any comments?
