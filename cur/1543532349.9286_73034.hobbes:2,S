Follow the pointer to the "software", which is

Note, in the next few days Ion and I will release templates that are updated
for 2.3.99-pre3.  We've been testing them for the past week or so, and are
now packaging them differently than before, so it's easier to release
updates in the future.  We'll make an announcement on linux-fsdevel.
Erez.
