Right.  The words should be corrected.
Since the only way to get a certain non-cached map was the (ab-)use of
dma_mmap_coherent(), such a confusing wording was chosen.

OK, so that part should work as is for PPC.

And dma_mmap_coherent() would be a solution for it, I suppose.

Yes.

The vmap() in sound/core/sgbuf.c can be omitted by adding proper PCM
callbacks (copy and silent) to handle SG-buffers.  These are only guys
that access the linear buffer runtime->area.
Then we'll just need a proepr mmap PCM callback just calling
dma_mmap_coherent() for each SG page.  Also, the default PCM mmap
should be fixed to use dma_mmap_coherent() appropriately.  That's
all.
So, what we really need is dma_mmap_coherent() implementations...
