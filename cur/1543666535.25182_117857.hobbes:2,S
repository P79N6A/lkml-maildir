Hello,
We have a driver which was originally bulit on Red Hat 7.2 version.Now we
are compiling the same driver on Red Hat 7.3 and 8.0
While compiling we are facing the following problems.
Compilation output :-
The following files are missing
/usr/include/asm/msr.h
/usr/include/asm/fixmap.h
/usr/include/asm/uaccess.h
/usr/include/asm/hardirq.h
But if we compile the driver using the include souces
/usr/src/linux-2.4/include we do not get any compilation errors.
Also our driver when compiled on Red Hat 7.2 does not give any compilation
problems.
Pls help.
Thanks and Regards
Chandrasekhar
