Hi Linux-Gods out in the world!
I need some detailed informations from experienced kernel programmers: Here 
is what I'd like to do (if it is possible):
I wrote an application A that uses a (self-written) syscall, which works 
fine. Now I would like to extend my syscall so that it affects another 
application B while it works in the kernel space via callback functions. 
The course should be as follows: I start the self-written application B 
that registers the set of callback functions. When my syscall enters the 
kernel space, it checks whether there are registered callback functions for 
the specified application (application B) and if so, it calls one of these 
callback functions.
Is this possible or can't I call some functions in the user space from the 
kernel?
In any way: thanx 1000 times for helping me
 marc
