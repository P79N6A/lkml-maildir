Well the last time I tried to get this by Andi we became a bit concerned 
when we realized that the memory map would grow by 14% in size. Given 
that 4k page size challenged platforms have a huge amount of page structs 
that growth is significant. I think it would be fine to do it for IA64 
with 16k page size but not for x86_64.
