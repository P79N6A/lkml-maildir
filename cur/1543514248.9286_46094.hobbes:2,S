	There are also power issues with the P5A and P5A-B with the
faster chips.  Depending on the system, failed soft reboots, random
reboots, crashes, IDE fails on boot, etc.
	Seems to be an issue with the CPU power regulator going
unstable, I had to get our builders to stop using the ASUS boards for
all K6-3, and K6-2 450 and up units (though ASUS claims they work
fine).  Have not seen any issues with the K6-2 400 and the current
revision P5A/B5A-B, though we have seen some of the older revs blow up
with the 400.
	Take a look at the Tyan S1590S (AT, UDMA33) and the S1598S
(ATX UDMA33/66) boards, 1M cache, and are happy with the high power
draw K6 units.
