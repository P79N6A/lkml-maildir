Hi all, please cc me, I'm off the list,
I had a problem with the vanilla RH6.1 kernel setup.  It couldn't
detect my printer:
	satisfactory:~# echo test > /dev/lp0
	bash: /dev/lp0: Device not configured
I figured out the problem was that the lp driver was getting loaded
before parport_pc.  I stuck this in my /etc/conf.modules:
	pre-install lp modprobe parport_pc
	options lp parport=0
It all works now.  This isn't exactly a clean solution.  Besides,
it shouldn't be broken in the first place.  Any ideas?
