Hm, you mean it would have gone after a reboot?... No, don't think I tried
to reboot. And, as said above, the directory is gone, so, can't check. I
did try to run the memtest at some point, once it did catch an error...
Well, I guess, we can just archive this error-report for statistical
purposes, but alone it hardly should raise any worries:-)
