I have a system which works for simple programs.  I haven't tested
mmap, statfs etc.
I use Matti Aarnio's patch available from
Fetch 
ftp://mea.tmt.tele.fi/linux/LFS/
with the modification that I use the following stat64 structure (in
linux/include/asm-i386/stat.h).  The kernel and glibc have
incompatible structures and instead of translating, I changed the
kernel structure:
struct stat64 {
        unsigned long long st_dev;
        unsigned short __pad1;
        unsigned long st_ino;
        unsigned int  st_mode;
        unsigned int  st_nlink;
        unsigned int  st_uid;
        unsigned int  st_gid;
        unsigned long long  st_rdev;
        unsigned short __pad2;
        unsigned long long st_size;
        unsigned long  st_blksize;
        unsigned long long st_blocks;
        unsigned long  st_atime;
        unsigned long  __unused1;
        unsigned long  st_mtime;
        unsigned long  __unused2;
        unsigned long  st_ctime;
        unsigned long  __unused3;
        unsigned long  __unused4;
        unsigned long  __unused5;
};
Then, you have to use glibc-2.1 (available from cygnus).  I use the
following one-liner to get stat64 working:
diff -ur glibc-2.1/sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/xstat64.c glibc-2.1-test/sysdeps/unix
/sysv/linux/xstat64.c

   struct kernel_stat kbuf;

   if (result == 0)
     result = xstat64_conv (vers, &kbuf, buf);
 
More patches to glibc are needed for the rest of the system calls, but
the above should get you going.
Compile as usual on a LSF system (-D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE
-D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64).
Remember to make your ext2-filesystem with a block-size larger than 1k
(which is the default)!  4k should suffice for most applications, but
check the documentation in the LFS patch.
