The documentation is correct, the implementation is broken. The
documented behaviour works for all platforms except one whose maintainer
has a problem with it and refuses to follow the spec.

The rest of the kernel deals with hardware limitations, 30bit DMA works
on the other platforms. This is an x86-64 platform problem. It
misimplements the basic pci_ functionality. If it doesn't wish to
implement the stuff (and there btw Andi I do think your view has
considerable merit) it should fail the set_mask requests.
