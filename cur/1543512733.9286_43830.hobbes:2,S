I had a fast look at the patch and one thing looks obviously wrong:
+/*

+ * We optimize by ignoring the request completely when the number of

+ * IOW on UP sched_yield() does nothing if this is the only process; on

+ * [note 'nr_running' is accessed w/o proper locking, but that's ok

+ */
+       if ( nr_running>smp_num_cpus )
+       {
You can't expect the other running tasks to reschedule idle CPUs as they
may be very fast tasks that needs to run on your CPU as they don't want to
trash the CPU cache. So you must _always_ reschedule if SCHED_YIELD is
asked.
