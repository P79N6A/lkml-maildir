Subject: [PATCH 2.6.25-rc1] cpufreq: fix cpufreq policy refcount imbalance
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

When one cpu is set to offline, the caller process will hang, according to
the trace data, the problem lies in the refcount error in cpufreq driver,
cpufreq_cpu_callback will wait for completion policy->kobj_unregister
which is nerver completed because a refcount error in function
__cpufreq_remove_dev in file driver/cpufreq/cpufreq.c results in not
calling kobject release method.
In driver/cpufreq/cpufreq.c, the refcount of data->kobj isn't 1 when it
will be unregistered, this problem didn't exist in 2.6.24 and earlier.
The root cause is kobject API switch, kobject_init_and_add and kobject_put
replace older kobject_register and kobject_unregister in 2.6.25-rc1,
compared to 2.6.24, kobject_unregister is deleted in function
__cpufreq_remove_dev but it isn't replaced with kobject_put.
This patch adds kobject_put to balance refcount. I noticed Greg suggests
it will fix a power-off issue to remove kobject_get statement block, but i
think that isn't the best way because those code block has existed very long
and it is helpful because the successive statements are invoking relevant
data.
