Because those people are many, and as long as there are volunteers to
maintain a branch, nobody can stop them from doing so.
BTW: I generally agree with you, that adding features should be limited.
However stuff like new drivers or subsystems which have their own lifecylce
and small impact are added to stable just because the innovations are needed
by the users (most often because of new hardware or generally more
stability or performance)
