Oh thanks David for the hint.
I added a split_page() call and it seems to work now.
[PATCH] MM : alloc_large_system_hash() can free some memory for non 
power-of-two bucketsize
alloc_large_system_hash() is called at boot time to allocate space for several 
large hash tables.
Lately, TCP hash table was changed and its bucketsize is not a power-of-two 
anymore.
On most setups, alloc_large_system_hash() allocates one big page (order > 0) 
with __get_free_pages(GFP_ATOMIC, order). This single high_order page has a 
power-of-two size, bigger than the needed size.
We can free all pages that wont be used by the hash table.
On a 1GB i386 machine, this patch saves 128 KB of LOWMEM memory.
TCP established hash table entries: 32768 (order: 6, 393216 bytes)
