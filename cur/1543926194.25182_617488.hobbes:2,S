Hi Andrew,
It appears that this patch is missing from the latest 2.6.24 git kernel?
(Suresh noticed that it is still a problem.)
Thanks,
Mike
This fix corrects the problem that early_identify_cpu() sets
cpu_index to '0' (needed when called by setup_arch) after
smp_store_cpu_info() had set it to the correct value.
