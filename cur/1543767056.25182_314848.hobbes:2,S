Torvalds tree - head
Hardware is as follows
	Promise IDE controller on ide0/1 - no drives
	VIA IDE controller on ide2/3 - hdd is a DVD-ROM
	and hdg is a disk.
hdd: TOSHIBA DVD-ROM SD-M1212
I had some code logging the commands issued and I did rmmod ide-cd. At
that point it sent a cache flush to the drive which then errorred it.
The actual log entry is
hdd: packet command error
Gives status=0x51, error=0x50
Dumping the error in detail its
Error;Illegal Request (Sense 0x05)
Invalid command operation code (0x20, 0x00)
The failed "Flush cache" packet command was
"35 00 00 00 00 00 ... 00"
