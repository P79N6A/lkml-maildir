Don't split the interface.  BUG_ON((flags&GPIOF_ASYNC) && !callback)
might be a good idea, but most likely there are valid reasons for NULL
callbacks as well.
Also, it's not unusual to request several pins at one.  If the
requester can simply provide a bitmask, the calling code is *much*
simpler.

These functions either lack a struct gpiochip argument or could be
omitted completely.

A private structure is surely needed, no?
Overall, I like the idea.  Having a standard interface for gpio
drivers makes life somewhat easier when writing a driver, and a *lot*
easier when using one.  With every driver having their own custom
interface, some *will* end up broken and unusable.
