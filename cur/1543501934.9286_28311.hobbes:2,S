Hi there!,
I have some Linux boxes with kernel 1.2.13 out there, without CD-ROM, and slow
CPU (about 486DX-33Mhz), and I want to update to the latest version. The problem
is that all these machines are managed via modem, and I can't send a full
linux.2.?.?.tar.gz (about 7/8Mb) and wait the compilation.
The idea is upload the zImage -previosuly compiled in a local machine- and
reinstall lilo, the problem I've found is that some programs does not work -FPE
error-, I am thinking about problem with /proc structs in the kernel version.
You know, program "ps" uses the /proc interface to show the information
requested, just like top and I don't know what else.
Thanks in advance. Please, I'm not subscribed to your mailing-list, if you think
you can help me, send me your notes to my personal e-mail address.
Saludos!, Regards,
