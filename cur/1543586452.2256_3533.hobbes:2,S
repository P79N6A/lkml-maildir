But my motherboard hangs at boot time (while Fasttrack tests for arrays) if
there is no array defined! There is a message from the Fasttrack bios that
says something like "no array found, press some key to continue". But I need
to remotely reboot these servers!

Which means? Can the Linux IDE driver be made to not deal with the Fasttrack
"raid" code and just treat the interface as normal non-raid ATA100
interfaces?
It is a real pity that Promise (the company) somehow doesn't seem to work
well with the Linux community. It is fast hardware (and I have 25 of them)
that lies useless for me right now.
Many thanks....
