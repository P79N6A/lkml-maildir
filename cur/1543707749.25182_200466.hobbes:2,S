Hello
I have unlucky with latest 2.4.25 kernel. Most of my machines after 
upgrade kernel to 2.4.25 (from 2.4.24) automatically restart after several 
hours, or Ooops (swapper proces, pid 0).
In logs file i haven't any information from kernel (oops and other strange 
thing). Unfortunately i can't connect serial console to catch information 
from console. :(
With 2.4.24 or earlier i had uptime about 50-100 days (except one machine)
I don't see any reports about this problem on this list, strange.
On 
http://lukasz.eu.org/2.4.25-rc1
 you can see ksymoops.txt or vmlinux
from machine where i tested 2.4.25-rc1.
