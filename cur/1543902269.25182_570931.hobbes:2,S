Wrong.
It's safer for two reasons:
 - now everybody will see the *same* behaviour
 - the "meaningless value" is guaranteed to not be a security leak
but the whole "shut up bogus warnings" is the best reason.
So it *is* safer than leaving the code as-is.
Of course, usually the best approach is to rewrite the code to be simpler, 
so that even gcc sees that something is obviously initialized. Sadly, 
people seldom do the right thing, and sometimes gcc just blows incredibly 
hard.
