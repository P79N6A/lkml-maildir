Nope.  My SATA RAID FAQ mentions the Promise "RAID accelerator" stuff. 
In particular, the Promise SX4 is in fact likely to be faster with the 
_Promise_ RAID driver, rather than the Linux non-RAID driver.
I really like the SX4, and wish Linux could make better use of it...
The SX4 has an on-board DIMM (128M - 2G), through which all data _must_ 
pass.  The data transfer between host and on-board DIMM is a separate 
DMA engine and separate interrupt event from the four ATA DMA engines 
(one per SATA port).  There are several possibilities that are worth 
exploring on this card:
* Caching
* Eliminate PCI bus traffic by sending RAID1/5 writes a _single_ time to 
the card, and then multiplex to multiple attached drives from there
* Offload RAID5 XOR calculations, which becomes quite useful in 
combination with these other features
* Execute RAID1/5 resyncs and parity checks completely on the card
I have full docs and knowledge, but no idea how to hook this stuff into 
Linux md efficiently.
