As I understand it the new ip-table code is supposed to replace the
ipforwarding as it was in the 2.2 kernel. Where can I find the
documentation to get this set up to make it work. I am
aware that I can compile the 2.2 code for ip forwarding into the kernel
and I did that with the test 5 version and all is well. However, I would
like to give the new stuff a try.
I looked at the stuff at  
http://www.linuxhq.com/kernel/v2.3/doc/
 and
looked in the Documentation directory of the source tree but couldn't
find anything obvious by name.
Thanks,
Robert.
