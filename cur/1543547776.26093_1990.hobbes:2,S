The exact same thing happened to my Inbox just now. I am using Netscape
Messenger and the latest build from the bitkeeper tree for ppc, which is
upt-to-date with 2.4.0-test8-pre4.
Of the 650 messages I kept in my Inbox, only the first 51 remained. The
rest was replaced by 0x00. Not nice. Not at all. Feels like your
ordinary Microsoft Word virus. Nothing like that happened with earlier
kernels up to -test7.
So I would like to warn anyone to touch this thing with a very long pole
only.
And Linus, please back out this evil viruslike bug.
The last message that stayed is one with a very long "To:" header, so
this may be the trigger for the bug. I have had this message in my Inbox
for 6 months without problems.
