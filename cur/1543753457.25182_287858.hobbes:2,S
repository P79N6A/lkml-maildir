Subject: [PATCH 4/29] x86-i8259-shutdown
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/1/19/41

From: Eric W. Biederman <ebiederm@xmission.com>
This patch disables interrupt generation from the legacy pic on reboot.  Now
that there is a sys_device class it should not be called while drivers are
still using interrupts.
There is a report about this breaking ACPI power off on some systems.
http://bugme.osdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4041
However the final comment seems to exhonorate this code.  So until
I get more information I believe that was a false positive.
