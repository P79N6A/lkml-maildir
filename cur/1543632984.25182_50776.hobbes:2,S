Arch dependent.  Parallel make dep will generate incomplete output on
some architectures, mainly those that generate files at make dep time.
mkdep.c only adds .h files to .[h]depend if the file exists.  With
parallel make dep the scanning of .c files can occur before the .h
files have been generated, resulting in an incomplete dependency tree.
Later changes may not rebuild everything that should be rebuilt.
Not a problem for kbuild 2.5 of course.
