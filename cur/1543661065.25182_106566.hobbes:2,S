Hello,
  I am experiencing some IDE problems with a Abit IT7 MAX2 V2.0 
motherboard. It's chipset is intel 845PE . I installed the Suse 8.0 
distribution (2.4.18 kernel) and it did no recognize the IDE controler 
(so no dma).
  I have tried with 2.4.20 and 2.4.21-pre4 kernels (stock kernels form 
kernel.org) and with both a get ide-dma errors after a while reported 
when using e2fsck (on my Ext3 filesystems).
Is there any data corruption issue with the intel 845PE chipset ?
Thanks in advance
    Miguel
