What we could do is just check list_empty(&inode->inotify_watchers)
and remove the atomic count completely.
We don't actually care about getting an exact count at all, just
whether or not it is empty, and in that case using list_empty is
no more racy than checking an atomic count, both are done outside
any locks.
It is basically just a lock avoidance heuristic. But I think count
is superfluous - off with its head!
