Hello,
1) Where's that patch to help solve the memory-problems in 2.2.9?   My
box just semi locked.  Alt F1-F10 worked, everything else didn't (Sysrq
didn't work either) ...
(The problem is easily repeatable ... and very annoying  ;o)
2) Is there an easy way to determine the page-size on a given box?  
(Without looking in the kernel-src ..)
Kind regards,
Brian
