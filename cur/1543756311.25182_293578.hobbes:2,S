Well, I have reiser4 on this drive with noncritical data which is rather
not used anyway.
But please note that, the process generating the oops (as long as I am
seeing this right) is something called swapper:
scheduling while atomic: swapper/0x00010001/0
My swap partition is not on hdc, it is on hda, which does not report
bad crc and any other dma related errors, or any for that matter.
The same machine runs on 2.6.10-ac10 + reiser-2.6.10 patch well or
at least it does not trigger these oopses.
Only some still not tracked down problems with terrible swap eating :-(
But that's a different story.
Regards,
Maciej
