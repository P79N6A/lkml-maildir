Yes, maybe some userspace such as HAL could turn off the usb devices at 
the same time it's unmounted. Actually that would be rather intuitive 
way to tell the user the umount is finished. There doesn't seem to be 
any loss of funcitonality, once it's turned off you can still re-access 
the device, and it's automatically turned on again (at least on my PC).
For the record, here is how one can switch off a usb device (as root):
# cd /sys/bus/usb/devices/usb*/[0-9]-[0-9] (just go to the directory of 
the device)
# echo -n 2 > *:1.0/power/state
# echo -n 2 > power/state
I use this to turn off my optical mouse when watching movies, but it 
works fine as well to turn off usb storage devices.
It can also be turned on with
# echo -n 0 > power/state
See you,
Eric
