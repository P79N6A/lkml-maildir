Subject: boot hangs with SMP, USB storage, and ACPI

When I try to boot a 2.6.17 kernel compiled for SMP (hyperthreading),
it hangs early in the boot sequence (after printing "Freeing SMP
alternatives").  The issue seems to be an interaction between a
USB-storage device (an empty flash card reader built into the
monitor) and ACPI.
It boots fine if I do any one of these:
  - physically disconnect the USB device
  - disable USB support in the BIOS
  - boot with acpi=ht
but none of these is completely satisfactory.
I'll happily supply more details, run tests, etc. if anyone is
interested in looking at this.  Thanks, and please CC me if you
respond.
