This looks like it's using some signed numbers that should be unsigned:
SCSI device sdc: -876998784 512-byte hdwr sectors (-449022 MB)
However all the tools (mkfs etc) work correctly and work out the correct
drive size (~1.75Tb):
/dev/sdc              1.7T  465G  1.2T  27% /usr/local/netflow/data
Apologies if it's already fixed in later 2.4.x.
David.
