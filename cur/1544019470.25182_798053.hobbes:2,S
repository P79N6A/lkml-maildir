Almost every single patch that makes code harder to read while removing
CONFIG_ references from the exported headers just take the wrong approach.
I read later in this thread that Ingo is planning to filter out these patches
so we can get the other ones in - good.
What we should try to do is to look at the bigger picture.
Sometimes the right answer is that this whole file should not
be exported or maybe only half should be exported.
But due to the fact that we have no established way to seperate
what is internal and what is exported *on the file level* people
keep sprinkling #ifdef __KERNEL__ all over the header files.
I checked include/linux - we have 494 places where we reference __KERNEL__
And that is in 237 files.
We export 354 files from this dir - so we already have > 100 files that is
exported to userspace without modifications.
So rather than start sprinkling the exported headers with "if 0" then
we should encourage to clean them and when accetable move them to
a dedicated abi directory.
This may need some cooperation with external parties such as glibc
and other libc variants. And we could improve here.
