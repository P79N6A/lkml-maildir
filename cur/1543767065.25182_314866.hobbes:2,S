Agreed, but 1) Do you have an idea on how to expose this capability with
the sysfs interface ? Adding ioctl's to it would suck big time :) and 2)
It's still nice to have a "workaround" for existing X since the
performance benefit is significant, but then, it's in arch code, so
that's fine (and I could indeed limit it to VGA class devices as David
suggests).
