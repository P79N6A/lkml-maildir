	That's because you couldn't distribute *new* copies.  I would 
surmise that there was zero effort to recall copies that had been
downloaded.
	I could see that americans couldn't speak or express** coding
algorithms after a new cryptography ban went into effect, but I
don't see that books already sold, or programs downloaded or source
given away would be affected.  However, it sounds like Canada views
has bowed down to the US government giving up protections for its
own citizens if there has been US involvement.

	This is something the FreeSWAN people should think about.  If
the US has already gotten Canada to negotiate away some of the
Canadian's rights w/respect to crypto then, if I was Canadian, I
expect the US might be able to "persuade" Canada to adopt similar
regulations -- maybe using NAFTA as leverage.  I don't think source
in Canada is far enough away from the US to be fully safe.
