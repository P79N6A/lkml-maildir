I have the same problem here with a toshiba satellite (with 
2.6.0-test1).  It boots ok, then when I reboot it stops before loading 
lilo (pure blank screen with only cursor on it). If I switch off/on it 
goes OK.
This wasn't happening in 2.5.66. ACPI S3 suspend/resume is working fine 
though. Could this be related to ACPI in any way?
