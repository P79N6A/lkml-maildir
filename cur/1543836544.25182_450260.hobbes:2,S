Could you point to a place where we can get a broken-down set of
patches for OpenVZ or (even better), UBC ?
For purposes of the resource management discussion, it will be
useful to be able to look at the UBC patches in isolation
and perhaps port them over to some common interface for testing
comparing with other implementations.
