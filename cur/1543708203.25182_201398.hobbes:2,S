Hi!
Yesterday I've setup a server with Adaptec's 1210SA SATA Controller and 
2 SATA disks. According to the kernel changelog the controller is 
supported since 2.6.2
I've installed Debian on an IDE disk, built a 2.6.3 kernel with 
CONFIG_SCSI_SATA_SIL, rebooted and the kernel detected the controller 
plus both SATA disks (sda, sdb). As the next step I wanted to create a 
software raid 1 with the 2 SATA disks. Because it took mdadm forever to 
finish, I checked /proc/mdstat and saw a progress bar with a rate of 12MB/s!
Even my oldest IDE disk is faster than this. Is there a way to tweak the 
SATA controller/disk with some kernel-options or is the driver not 
providing more speed?
Any hints?
Thanks..
Patrick
