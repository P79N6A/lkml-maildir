Thanks for the positive feedback!
About to add and test HPT372 final and then complete the MMIO operations.
Next will be to make the driver do the error recovery path that block does
not support and accellerate IO with true zero-copy.  Lastly will make the
entire stack modular, which is about 50% completed.
Cheers,
