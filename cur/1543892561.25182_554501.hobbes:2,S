If other cpus don't exist then smp_call_function() should just do
*nothing* (there is no other cpu right?). We don't want to sprinkle
a ton of #ifdef CONFIG_SMP around each smp_call_function().

No. Current semantics of smp_call_function_single() are that it
returns -EBUSY if called on the *current* cpu. Since on !CONFIG_SMP the
only possible cpu it can be called on is the current one, the only
sane return value is -EBUSY.
