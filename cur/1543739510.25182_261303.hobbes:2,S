No. A million things might happen between select() and recvmsg(), both
in kernel and application. For a consistent behaviour throughout all
possibilities, you *have* to assume that any read on a blocking fd may
block, and that a fd ready for reading at select() time might not be
readable once the app gets to recvmsg() -- for whatever reason.
And indeed, that implies that select() on blocking fds is generally
not useful if you expect to bypass the blocking through select().
Personally,  I think any application that implements this expectation
is broken. (If only because you might have to do a second read() or
recvmsg() which will either result in a crappy select() loop or a
broken read()/recvmsg() loop).

That use of select() *is* useless, there's no doubt about that. It is
an application problem though.

Where's the proof?! You *define* some behaviour that you think makes most sense.

That is not a DoS, it is an application feature or bug, depending on
what the programmer was thinking.

From a pragmatic point of view, it may be comforting to know that most
applications that can now be considered broken will *still* be broken
even if a recvmsg() will never block after select() has given the
verdict "Thou shalt read".
