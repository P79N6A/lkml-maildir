It's completely up to the client to define whatever file operations it
wants, which are passed in to relayfs_create_file().  The relayfs
example apps, for instance, read from these files whenever they're
notifed via the relay file poll implementation that there's a
sub-buffer ready.  These are basically the same thing as proc or
debugfs files created by passing explicit file operations.

Yes, the client can supply a write() file op that does whatever it
wants to.  For the relayfs examples, the write() implementation
updates the count of sub-buffers consumed, for instance.
