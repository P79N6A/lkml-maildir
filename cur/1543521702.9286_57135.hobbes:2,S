Same thing here, happens from time to time since I upgraded my
hardware.
Before upgrade: dual celeron 433 on abit bp6, 1 6.4Gb IDE disk, 1
4.5Gb UW SCSI, ext3 (and ext2 before that), kernels 2.2.12 to
2.2.14pre*.
After upgrade: added a 20Gb IDE disk, filesystems now ext2 and
reiserfs. Kernels 2.2.13+reiserfs 3.5.14, 2.2.14+reiserfs 3.5.1[45].
