+#ifdef CONFIG_X86_HT
+	/* On Hyper-Threading CPUs - if only one physical installed
+	   balance does not make sense */
+	if (cpu_has_ht && smp_num_siblings == 2 && num_online_cpus() == 2) {

+#endif
Further down, i believe the following would have the same effect;
	/*
	 * Enable physical balance only if more than 1 physical processor
	 * is present
	 */
	if (smp_num_siblings > 1 && !cpus_empty(tmp))
		physical_balance = 1;
tmp = cpu_online_map >> 2;
so we drop the first two processors (logical or physical) and only enable
physical balance if there are still processors present in the map. Or are
you observing something else?
