What? You do the RAID on partitions, so you can do anything you want.
They don't aven have to be the same type RAID, I once ran fours drives
with a small 0+1 partiton (2+2) for reliability and read performance,
and a large partition of the rest of the drives RAID-5. Different stripe
size, because one array had many small reads and the other many large
reads.
You can do anything you have the guts to do, except change partition
size once you are setup.
