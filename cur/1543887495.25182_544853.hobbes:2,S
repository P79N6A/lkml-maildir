Several thousand times. :)

Absolutely! I added this line for sparse:
+#define __CHECK_ENDIAN__ 
Not sure how much of the kernel is endian-clean.  Logfs should be.

There shouldn't be anything left in ../logfs.h that is needed for
userspace.  But the kernel fsck is lame and calls into functions like
iget(), which it pulls in from ../logfs.h.
