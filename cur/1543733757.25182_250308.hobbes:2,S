No, none at all.  <thinks>
We already have an ext3 function that's called on all opens ---
currently it checks nothing except O_LARGEFILE, but it's an easy and
obvious place where we could set up the may-write bits.
We'd have to take special care with directories, and potentially with
xattrs, but I don't see any great problems with doing it.

Yep.

Yes, it should be hidden inside the allocation code, and should work
straight out of the box for directories.  But thinking about that,
there's at least one obvious difference that we need to worry about:
there's no "close" on directories to indicate when we've stopped
extending the dir, and can discard the reservation.
That shouldn't lead to spurious ENOSPC, but might lead to suboptimal
layout on full filesystems if we have reserved all the free space and
have to fall back to the old allocation mechanism.
