Wouldn't you be able to post these items in sysfs attributes in the SAS
transport layer, assuming the cciss driver used the SAS transport layer.
Then the LLDD would be responsible for retrieving/setting the attribute
using whatever method is appropriate (dma, request queues, etc). 
I was hoping to start work on adding SDI operations to Christoph
Hellwig's SAS transport layer sometime next week.
