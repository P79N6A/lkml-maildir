OR
50 % of kernel size is from /linux/drivers
25 % of kernel size is from machine dependent /linux/arch/XXXX and
/linux/include/XXXX
If  we are able to divide Linux tree in such a way that everyone can
download it from from their personnal modems and enjoy linux.
may be i am wrong .
But i love downloading whole kernel and i usually refer different
architectures.
Thank you,
Best Regards,
Jaswinder.
