Hi Ingo,
As you can see from the note below, we are still having issues with
this testcase.  As a reminder Darren's mail with a pointer to the
new testcase is at:
http://www.uwsg.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0606.1/0729.html
When run with the '-i' option it fails on a regular (aprox 50% on 4 way)
basis.  Any insight into what may be happening would be appreciated.
Thanks,

Mike
