What is the rationale for this? Doing this encourages people to write
device drivers in user space that probably should be a kernel driver.
What are you going to do if two competing apps want to set it to two
different states?
An alternate way to fix this problem is to write a device driver that
attaches to hardware with PCI class VGA. The driver could then provide
a device for each card found. By opening the device you can control
who owns and enables it.
We already have a lot of problems with multiple drivers trying to
control a single piece of hardware. Adding an "enable" attribute makes
it even easier to build conflicting drivers.
