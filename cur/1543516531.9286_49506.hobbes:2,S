I note that some have already answered with some jokes. Perhaps
your problem lies in the translation of what a byte-stream is.
TCP/IP provides a byte-stream in which the first byte sent is guaranteed
to be the first byte received. Therefore, it is a transparent data
connection in which you can send and receive any kind of information you
wish.
If you want to make communications "portable", you can't send or
receive the images of structures or other aggregate types because
the receiving machine may not have the same byte-ordering as your
machine. However, present-day bytes, of the 8-bit length (there are
others), are machine independent. Therefore, you can portably send and
receive these kinds of bytes between all kinds of machines.
Bytes consists of bits. Therefore a byte-stream is a bit-stream.
  bits     Value
00000000   0x00
00000001   0x01
00000010   0x02
00000011   0x03
00000100   0x04
00000101   0x05
