I tested this patch and it looks like it has cured my mysterious TCP
stalls.
without patch:
    cache  mtu 1500 rtt 479411ms rttvar 953813ms cwnd 46 advmss 1460
I see that before and during the stall if not using this patch.
(rtt is never above 20ms accoring to ping)
With the patch I see normal rtt and rttvar times.
Havn't seen a stall yet (~30 kernelcompiles with distcc over a sometimes
congested link), will continue testing.
