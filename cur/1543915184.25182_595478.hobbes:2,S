Is on lkml and linux-mm:

The patchset does buffer_heads: 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/8/31/348
I think the whole approach is reasonable.  It's mainly a matter of going
through it all with a toothcomb and getting it all merged up, tested and
integrated.  There's considerable potential for nasty and rarely-occurring
surprises in this stuff because it tends to approach locking in the
reversed order.

There were a few desultory comments, but I see no sign that the bulk of
the patches have had any serious review and testing from anyone yet.
