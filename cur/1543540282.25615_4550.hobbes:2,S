Subject: Patch to 2.4.0-test5 to fix race in write_chan

Andrea Arcangeli patched 2.2.17 like this (thanks Andrea).  We would like to
see the patch in 2.4.0 also.
It fixes a race in write_chan in n_tty.c when the wake up on tty->write
occurs in an interrupt handler.  This has been a problem in the USB serial
drivers.  We can mostly work around it on UP, but not on SMP.  I posted
details and Andrea replied with the patch in linux-kernel on 6/28/2000.
Thanks,
