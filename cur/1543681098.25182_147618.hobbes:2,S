Page remapping is adequate for send of data when the MSS is below the
VM page size since you don't have to send all of the page you pinned
or set COW/SOW (sleep on write)
For receive if your hardware can do demux from the tcp headers and
expecting sequence then page remapping isn't needed either.
Finally if you are streaming objects by non mapped references (eg
sendfile or see LM's paper from long ago on splice()) then the problem
goes away.
