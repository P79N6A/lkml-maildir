if you are interested in spinning down hard drives, you might want to read
http://www4.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/Publications/pdf/Weissel-Beutel-Bellosa-OSDI-CoopIO.pdf
they describe strategies to get maximum sleep times for drives by
bundling accesses to hard discs.
they even go a little bit faster and allow user space to give hints
about when they need data.
i only had a brief look at the sources but i guess this could be folded
into the aio interface.
(CoopIO as described above adds its own system calls)
it would be great if somethink like that could be ported to 2.5...
