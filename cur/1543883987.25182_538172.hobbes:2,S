Oh you're terribly right ! I have grepped my logs and found it lying
there too in the middle of the memory probe messages and the IO probe
ones. I never noticed it. I know it's my fault, but I think that
"fat warning" is not really what could characterize it though, because
of the context verbose around it :
pcmcia: parent PCI bridge Memory window: 0x90000000 - 0x903fffff
pcmcia: parent PCI bridge Memory window: 0x30000000 - 0x3dffffff

Now I have the URL for the details ;-)
BTW, I thing we should standardize on some formating to display messages
about deprecated/obsolete code. Maybe something like this would be more
noticeable :
