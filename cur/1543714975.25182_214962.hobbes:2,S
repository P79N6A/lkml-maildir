You're probably reading the kernel output from syslog. Syslog 
periodically reads out the printks from the kernel. With the amount of 
printks you're doing you are probably printing info for about 4500 
interrupts between every time syslog checks for new kernel output, while 
the kernel buffer that is used to store this information can only handle 
   enough data for 80 interrupts.
