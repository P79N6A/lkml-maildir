 Why?  Shouldn't it be easy to fix dmesg so it unmangles the output?
 The real problem I see is that this approach doesn't make it any
easier to translate the messages.
  Maybe someone should just try to write a Babelfish-like thing that
takes English kernel-speak and translates it as best it can?  It would
at least be amusing to read the output. :)
