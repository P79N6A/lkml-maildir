Hi,
	When a system runs out of memory (OOM), the Linux OOM killer
makes a best effort guess 
at which program is being excessive about its memory usage.
Unfortunately it isn't always correct 
especially on embedded systems. 
	I noticed that there was a person proposed an idea to replace
the default
kernel OOM with a module in CGL discussion, and he also gave out a patch
for 2.6.0-pre11,
which can be found at 
http://www.rossfell.co.uk/~rickp/oom/.
	How about your idea on the proposal? Any comments are welcome!	
Thanks
Guo Min
