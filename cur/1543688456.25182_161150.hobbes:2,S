Hi Ani
I have noticed that the Radeon 9800 chipset is now supported by the
framebuffer subsystem ("drivers/video/radeonfb.c") in the latest 2.4
kernels. That is nice, thanks :-)
But I also noticed that the chipset it is not supported in the latest 2.6
test kernels.
Do you have any idea when this support will be added?
Best regards,
Kristian Spangsege
