Unfortunately (as always) there were tons of delays that didn't allow me 
to finish the complete test suite as I hoped I could but I sent some 
information off this list to Jamal and the nf-hipac guys about previous 
test result. See below. I hope I can do more tests this weekend ...

Yes and it was very convincing after the first few tests Some prelimiary 
test with raw TCP throughput have given me following really cool results:
TCP RAW throughput 100Mbit/s max MTU:
