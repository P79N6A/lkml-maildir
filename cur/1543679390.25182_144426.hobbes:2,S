Hello,
I'm running this patch for a couple of hours and it is worse than the
plain 2.5.73-bk7. It doesn't hang exactly (and I didn't listen to any
music, yet) but during normal work (switching x-screens, scrolling in
browser, pressing keys, etc.) the systems hangs non-deterministically
for maybe half a second or so. For example, when I typed this sentence I
noticed that pressing the backspace key didn't trigger anything for a
while and then it continued with the sentence (correctly, tho).
I cannot reproduce it and the machine is doing virtually nothing. Please
tell me if you need more information.
