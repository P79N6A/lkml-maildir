I'd have to see an empirical demonstration or some previously published
analysis (or previously published empirical demonstration) to believe
this does as it should.
Not to slight the originator, but it is a technique without an a priori
time (or possibly space either) guarantee, so the trials are warranted.
I'm overstating the argument because it's hard to make it sound slight;
it's very plausible something like this could resolve the time issue.
