Thanx. I love linux - yes I may need treatment, but I would really love
it if when 2.2.4 comes out in the fall, patch-int-2.2.4 came out at the
same time. Us guys here don't judge each other by the size of our ...
but rather by the version of our kernel. Therefore, keep up the good
work and please be this efficient with 2.2.4. Thanx.
