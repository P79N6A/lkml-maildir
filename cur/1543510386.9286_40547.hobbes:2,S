First, if you're using capabilities, the privileges are seperate.
Otherwise, it's a matter of which access should you chmod to. You
could do like exec, where anyone having execute access means the
privileged user can, but without that you have to go searching
about to determine the least access you can provide and have root
get it. Presummably the file will be neither owned by root or
root's group, in which case you have to chmod it to 006, which
gives the world access.
