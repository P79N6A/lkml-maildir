I get a guilt hit for every off-topic post to usenet or .*@vger that I
send.  I sorry to say that, very slightly entertaining though you
might be, someone should drop you from linux kernel.  I don't want to aim
flamage at any particular account of person, but you have undoubtedly
abused linux-kernel, and should accept responsibility and desist from
starting such horrifically off-topic flaewars on linux-kernel.
Matthew.
