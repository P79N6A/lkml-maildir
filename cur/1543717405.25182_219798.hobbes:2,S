...and it is very upsetting. Kurt helped me a lot during the initial
porting of the driver to 2.6 and I very appreciate his help. I understand
he is very and very busy and that driver is not top priority / importance,
but still, I think, it wouldn't hurt anybody if it was reasonably
supported / maintained. I think I did nothing wrong by proposing a patch,
and it is just pity if it remains unused. It might (in principle) be
wrong, and then I would appreciate at least a short explanation.
Thanks
