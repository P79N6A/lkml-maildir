might it not make more sense to put all of that into a new
subdirectory, say, /drivers/char/pcmcia/ipwireless_cs?  that way, it's
more modular and it will keep that higher-level directory from
potentially getting cluttered with even more drivers.  and it would
let you drop the pointless "ipwireless_cs_" prefix from all of those
files as well.
