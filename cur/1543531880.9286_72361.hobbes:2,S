As I pointed out later, the interesting part is "demand-loading", which
demand-loads both text and data.

I don't know; what happens now if you use more than 8 MB of stack? Do "bad
things" happen, or does the kernel grow the stack?
If the stack can grow, this doesn't really help. And I'm not sure I like
the idea anyway; it's like optimizing for the worst case instead of the
common case.

Touching malloc()'ed pages doesn't solve anything -- this is no different
from the case of not touching them immediately, and trying to use them
later. The malloc() still returns a valid pointer but no real memory. If
you then try to touch the memory, what happens when the kernel can't get a
free page?

Seems like a kludge to me.
