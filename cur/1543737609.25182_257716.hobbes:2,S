You could use sched_clock() which will do better.  The setting of 
timestamp in schedule() gives you a pretty good chance that it's value 
will be greater than timestamp_last_tick.

I have experienced it going backwards and I assumed that it was due to 
the timing code applying corrections.  (You've got two choices if your 
clock is running fast: one is to mark time until the real world catches 
up with you and the other is to set your clock back to the correct time 
when you notice a discrepancy.  I assumed that the second strategy had 
been followed by the time code and didn't bother checking further 
because it was an easy problem to sidestep.) Admittedly, this behaviour 
was only observed when measuring very short times such as the time spent 
on the runqueue waiting for CPU access when the system was idle BUT it 
was definitely occurring.  And it only occurred on a system where the 
lower bits of the values returned by sched_clock() were not zero i.e. a 
reasonably modern one.  It was observed on a single CPU machine as well 
and was not, therefore, a result of drift between CPUs.

I'm reasonably confident that ZAPHOD doesn't change the values of 
timestamp or timestamp_last_tick to something that they would not have 
been without ZAPHOD and there are other scheduler changes (than 
ZAPHOD's) in -mm2 which may bear examination.
ZAPHOD also did not introduce the declaration of these values as 
unsigned long long as that is present in rc3.  BTW a quick to the 
problem is to change their declarations to just long long as we don't 
need the 64th bit for a few hundred years.
