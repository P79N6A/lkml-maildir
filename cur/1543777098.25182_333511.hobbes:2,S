Ingo Molnar's realtime-preempt patches used to be based on the -mm 
kernels, but now they appear to be based on the mainline kernels, so 
they don't support reiser4 (at least until reiser4 is merged into 
mainline, which is looking uncertain as I understand it).
Is realtime-preempt-2.6.10-mm1-V0.7.34-01 the most recent 
realtime-preempt kernel to support reiser4?
How is the latency of the reiser4 code itself?
