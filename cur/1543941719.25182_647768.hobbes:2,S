It doesn't occur with 36555adc here - at least, it didn't the two times I've 
booted a kernel built from that tree. With 36555adc I have other problems and 
will be refreshing my copy of the code first. But I will start bisecting if 
the problem persists.
I'm also going to make sure it wasn't caused by something strange, although, 
IIRC, the only real differences in the configs from the kernel that booted 
but had the somewhat random libata problem and the "strange xchat lockup"
problem is the CPA code and the "pre-emptible RCU" - so I'm going to turning 
off one and then both of those options.
