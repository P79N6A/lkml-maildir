    Everything which is in above.net's eigth subnets is
    blacklisted. I've talked to Alan of ORBS and he isn't
    willing to remove certain hosts, because that would cause the
    DNS zones to grow enourmously.
    Check mail.linux.com and va.php.net, they are definitely in
    ORBS. 
    We need publicity for the unwashed masses (ORBS vs.
    above.net, good vs. bad).
