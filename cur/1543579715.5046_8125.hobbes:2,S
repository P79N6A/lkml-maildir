Not safely.  Some symbols must be kept to assist insmod and hot
plugging, strip does not know about these special symbols.
Why do you need to strip modules anyway?  I don't see the point unless
you are critically low on disk space.  Stripping the symbols makes it
much harder to debug oops in modules, ksymoops needs all the symbols.
