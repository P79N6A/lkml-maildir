My guess is that since it's not in there, I might be the only one who
noticed.  Unfortunatly that looks to be bad news for me...  I have 5
machines with these cards, and my pockets are not so deep as to be able
to replace them with something newer.  
My goal was to get AOE working over the FC card {rather than ethernet}
and retire my FC SAN.  {I have my moments for doing stupid things like
this} {and yes it was a bet....}
I took a brief look at the code {I am no developer, let alone a driver
maintainer} but I think I can get the driver shored up with a current
kernel {I hope}.  The question is will anyone other than me care,
because if not, I doubt that the driver will be re-added from what you
said.

It was dropped because it was unmaintained, and quickly falling behind
mainline.  If it's a maintained driver with an active userbase, we're
interested...
