> [PATCH] Select root-fs by UUID or label
I have mixed feelings about such a patch.
Am too lazy to elaborate.
> [PATCH] /proc/partitions show startings sectors
I didnt like this patch.
The existence of /proc/partitions is important.
Without it one could not reasonably support
mounting by label or UUID.
But now that we have it, changing the format is harmful;
there should be a very good reason for doing that.
And showing starting sectors is not so essential.
Nobody wants to know them.
A utility with a 10-line source would print /proc/partitions
with an additional starting sector column.
Also, e.g., "hdparm -g device" will give you this.
> Can I at least have a "Your patches suck , go away !" ?
Should everybody complain as soon as he disagrees with
anything? The linux-kernel list would explode.
Generally the people maintaining various source trees
are discerning enough to weed out most bloat.
