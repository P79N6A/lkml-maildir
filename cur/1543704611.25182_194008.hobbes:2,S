It's not just "old implementations" -- it's the spec.
After reaching a filename beginning with 00, no further data should be
assumed to be in that filesystem.  MS-DOS itself would only do that
when formatting the filesystem, so *all* the subsequent entries would
be assumed to start with 00, but that doesn't really seem to be to
spec.
