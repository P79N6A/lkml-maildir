Unfortunately, you didn't answer my question. The observed problem is
that the final kref_put gets called at a time where there are still
references to the context in nfsi->open_files, and other threads
therefore do get at them.
The list_empty()/list_del() in nfs_free_open_context is bogus, because
as you say, there is a guarantee that there is no other reference on
the structure, and I take it that ought to include the ->open_files
list.
I would guess that a quick fix for this looks something like the
patch below. The race is in put_nfs_open_context() between the point
where we check the reference count and the point where the context
gets removed from the open_files list. If another thread searches
the list between these points and grabs a new reference, we die.
The patch holds the i_lock around the kref_put to prevent others
from searching the list. Ugly, I know, but it seems that's the
price you pay for using a kref in such unconventional ways, i.e.
not counting every reference.
