I appreciate that but per-function tracing is overkill. Especially since
the macros used for it are very obfuscating (i.e. return_VALUE, et al)
and we have things like kprobes.

My main concern is that the ACPI subsystem uses obfuscating macros to
implement function tracing in the kernel. Please note that we do not
allow this in new code and there are janitor such as myself that are
working to remove the existing ones.
While I have no intention of making your life as Linux maintainer
harder, I would appreciate if you would at least consider ripping out
function tracing from upstream. I am certainly willing to relicense or
even transfer copyrights of the patch if that's what you need.
