Can you tell me what is so particularly bad about the idea to cope a little bit
with braindead (or just-dying) hardware?
See, a car (to name a real good example) is not primarily built to have
accidents. Anyway everybody might agree that having a safety belt built into it
is a good idea, just to make the best out of a bad situation - even if it never
happens - , or not?

No. The only thing we do is completely re-writing them once a day (data gets
exchanged). So our usage pattern is not: dump data on it and thats it (like
most of the people might do with big disks).
