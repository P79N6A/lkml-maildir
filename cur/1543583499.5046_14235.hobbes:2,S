Is it legal, BTW? Obfuscated drivers should _not_ be linked into
kernel, because they are not "form preferable for editing". 
<GPL>
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
</GPL>
So nvidia drivers *are* binary only, as far as GPL is concerned. They
should never be linked into kernel.
[Or, someone should get kernel with nvidia drivers compiled in from
nvidia, and then ask them for sources :-)]
