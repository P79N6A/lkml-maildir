The way it currently works is: after your patch is added to the
official kernel, glibc will add the defines to <bits/mman.h> and the
syscall stub to the library.  Note that madvise() is already a
function in libc you can call - it happens to do nothing but return -1
with errno set to ENOSYS, but it's there...
We've been round and round the duplicate info in kernel and libc
headers problem many times, and this is the least bad solution
anyone's come up with to date.
