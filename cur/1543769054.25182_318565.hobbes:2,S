I'm getting tired of telling you this same patch doesn't apply. The
rejections are all in your compat_ioctl changes.
The removal of struct file * from your compat ioctl signature has
already been done ... it had to be otherwise the driver would have no
longer compiled.
Please get the latest kernel from kernel.org and prepare your patch
against that.
Thanks,
James
