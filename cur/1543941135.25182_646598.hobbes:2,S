Why would the list_del generate problems?

You could pin via mm_users? Then it would be entirely safe and no need for 
rcu tricks?
OTOH if there are mm_count users like in KVM: Could we guarantee that 
they do not perform any operations with the mmu notifier list? Then we 
would be safe as well.

It is useful if a device driver has a list of data segments that contain 
struct mmu_notifiers. The device driver can inspect the mmu_notifier and 
reliably conclude that the beast is inactive.
