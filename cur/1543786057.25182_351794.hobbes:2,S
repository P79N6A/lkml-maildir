Hmm. 
We hold the page_table_lock when doing the fork(), so T2 can't actually be 
copying the page until we've done the TLB flush, no? And once the TLB 
flush is done, all the writes by T3 should be in the page, so we copy the 
right thing at that point, and there is no consistency problems?
No? What am I missing?
