I'll add my little comments as well, and hopefully not start a flamewar... :)
[snip comments about blocksize, etc.]
Here's a real-life example of something that most of you will probably hate
me for mentioning:
HFS uses variable sized blocks (made up of multiple 512 byte sectors), but
stores block numbers as a 16 bit value. (I know, everyone will say, "We're
talking about moving from 32 to 64 bits." Keep listening.) This gave great
performance on the then current massive storage of a 20M drive. However,
when it became possible to get the absolutely gigantic hard drive of 1G,
it became more and more obvious that it was a drawback that was causing
a huge amount of wasted space. Apple had to design a new filesystem (HFS+)
that was able to represent blocks with a 32 bit number to overcome the
effective limitation on how big a filesystem could be. It's getting to
the point now that it's easily possible to put together a disk array that
is large enough that even referring to blocks with a 32 bit value requires
relatively large blocks. I don't know if we have very many filesystems that
would support this feature, but it will become important a lot sooner than
anyone may be thinking.
Obviously this case isn't a perfect fit for the situation, since HFS was
designed to be read by 32 bit machines, and the upgrade to 32 bits didn't
give a CPU penalty, just a bus bandwidth problem. Also, I'm coming from
a platform that actually can do a decent job of 64 bit, unlike x86, but
we shouldn't disallow people from doing bigger and better things. It's
become very popular lately to position Linux as an enterprise-ready system,
and this is something that will be expected. People will want to access
a multi-TB database as a single file, as well as other things that may
seem crazy to most people now.
I understand people's aversion to the #ifdefs in the code, but if the changes
are made in a sane way, it can still be clean and easy to maintain. It's
worth it to add a little complexity (particularly as an option) to add a
feature that people will be demanding in the relatively near future. It
might be a good idea to wait for 2.5, tho...

P.S.: No, I have no personal reason to need any of this 64 bit filesystem
stuff. Just trying to point out possibilities. Don't expect me to actually
be writing this stuff...
