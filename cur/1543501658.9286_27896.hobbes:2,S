I already thought a bit about it, I don't think it should be that hard.

Something like that should be ok. Btw I'll soon be submitting the comx
drivers to the kernel, they need no ioctl's at all, everything is set up
thru the /proc filesystem (echo ppp >/proc/comx/comx0/protocol), i quite
like this idea (it wasn't written by me, but the previus maintainer).

I'd be glad to help. The comx drivers frame-relay code (which I
maintain, and support since february, I haven't done much with it
though) needs a bit of redesign, since it is tied to the hardware drivers
much more than it needs to be.
