Hi,
	Are there any graphics console
drivers, which export some of the hardware graphic
capabilites to the programs through IOCTL's.
	I know that this type of driver
is very much chipset dependent. But i am looking
for a kernel mode graphics driver ( not svagalib )
which exports atleast vga capabilities.
	Since now-a-days graphics chips are having
either direct draw or openGL support in hardware,
I am actually looking for drivers which exploits graphic
acceleration provided by these types of chips.
	If such a thing is not existing, can any 
one suggest me some existing software from which
i can add my code for hardware graphics acceleration.
Thanks & Regards,
