Subject: [PATCH] [2.6.0-test10-mm1] Typo in Documentation/networking/ip-sysctl.txt

Hi all:
There is a small typo in Documentation/networking/ip-sysctl.txt. It
still says HZ for i386 architecture is 100, when it is no longer true.
The following patch should update it to current HZ=1000 for i386.
Although the hint following the text points to the correct place to
check for the correct value, HZ=100 for i386 is not correct in 2.6.x.
Greetings.
