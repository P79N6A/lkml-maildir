I'm having a similar problem (data mutations while disk read/write).
Thanks, Alex.  I'll try that.
Also, Pablo Bianucci, who originally wrote about the weird data
corruption, kindly wrote to me that he might have been accessing the
memory at a too fast speed, and slowing down things a bit in the BIOS
setup had seemingly fixed the problem.
But I'm still somewhat uneasy about possible data mutations.  Is there
any way to have Linux report checksum error for disk read/write?
