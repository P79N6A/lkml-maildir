   If these are freezes I had them too in 2.4.1, 2.4.2-pre1 fixed it for me.
   Really I think it was the patch in handle_mm_fault setting TASK_RUNNING.

Ohoh, I see that I fat-fingered the kernel version.  The test box
kernel is 2.4.2-pre2 with Axboe's loop4 patch to the loopback fs.  It
runs a three partition drive, a small /boot in ext2, / as reiser and
swap.  I am verifying that the freeze is repeatable at the moment, and
so far I cannot cause free memory to drop to 200k and a short ice age
does not occur.  Unless I can get that to repeat, the effort will be
useless... the only real difference is swap, it was not initially
active and now it is.  Free memory never drops below 540k now, so I
would suspect a MM influence.  james@pcxperience.com didn't mention
the memory values in his initial post, but it would be interesting to
see if he simply leaves his machine alone if it recovers
(i.e. probable swap thrashing) and then determine if the freeze ever
re-occurs.  James seems to have better repeatability than I do.
Rebooting and retrying still doesn't result in a noticable freeze for
me.  Some other factor must have been involved that I didn't notice.
Still seems like MM over reiser tho.
PS for james:
>One thing I did notice was that the syncing of the raid 1 arrays went in
sequence, md0, md1, md2 instead of in parrallel.  I assume it is because
the machine just doesn't have the horsepower, etc. or is it that I have
multiple raid arrays on the same drives?
Same drives.
