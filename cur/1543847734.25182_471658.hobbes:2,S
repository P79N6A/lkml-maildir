An all-in-one patch for this can be found at:
	
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/gregkh/stable/patch-2.6.17.14-rc1.gz
if anyone wants to test this out that way.
Also, this is probably going to be the last 2.6.17-stable release,
unless there is something major that we are missing here in this one.
