Subject: Suppressing Pentium timeoffset jitter in 2.0.36

Hi!
I found out that Linux 2.0.36 has 200us and above jitter when
reading the time.  Interestingly this is not that much caused by
system load (Emacs C-U 8 M-x hanoi almost had no effect), but by
the schduling of timer events (itimer). At least in xntpd the jitter
was present when it ran.
I merged my old "madtime patch" with the code found in 2.2 and made
the following patch, possibly a good candidate for 2.0. If anyone
cares for a 2.0.37...
Regards,
Ulrich
P.S. The patch is part of PPSkit-0.3.9
P.P.S. Our mail system is down since Friday 22:00 MET, and they are
still "working on the problem". See when the message will leave...
