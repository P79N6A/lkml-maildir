  Hi all,
  Last night i solved this problem. It cause by crippled PCI chipset
parody called ALi and his perverse undocumented "features". I think that
use ISA bridge as IRQ router if we haven't any router is guite good idea.
  Everythink with this patch works fine even though i have different irq in
win. See attached logs.
  Jim, can you try this patch please? I assume that you have some kind
of ALi chipset too. Maybe this solves your problem too.
  Martin, Marcelo, please aply :-).
PS: is here anybody who have relevant datascheet?
  Regards,
--
