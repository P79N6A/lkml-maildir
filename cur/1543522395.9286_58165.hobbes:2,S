Well, one very bad thing would happen if just that one change was made
to the kernel - how could you boot a root NFS box which had IP chains
configured?  Lets look at what happens:
Kernel boots, input and output chains are set to DENY
Kernel sends bootp packet
	(packet is blocked by output chain)
Kernel re-sends bootp packet
	(packet is blocked by output chain)
Kernel retries about 10 times
Kernel panics
Hmm, not very productive is it?
I for one run this exact setup - a root NFS masquerading firewall.  A change
to a default of DENY would currently break root NFS.
IMHO, it's better that it does default to ACCEPT, and as you say, you have
an option to use 'ipchains -P input DENY' before bringing up the interface
if you so wish.
