Sounds good, as long as it is simple (read: simplest) to read and
export the result of everything as one patch.  I.e. I wouldn't want to
see this:
@@ -28,6 +28,7 @@
+	/* new comment in empty raea */
 
 
 
@@ -28,67+28,7 @@
 
 
 
-	/* new comment in empty raea */
+	/* new comment in empty area */
 
 
 
But that goes without saying, doesn't it? ;)

Diffs to diffs I am even less eager to read.  As an internal format,
they make sense, though.
