A hacky solution is to modify drivers/char/Config.in to not allow DRM
as something that could be built unless you've configured for !386.
The best solution is to modify the illegal instruction trap to 
emulate the missing insn on x86 via cli+sti.  This would be useful
from userland as well.  It doesn't win speed awards, but it's easy
correctness without punishing Real Computers.
