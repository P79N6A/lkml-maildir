You better do not combine clean targets with build targets. If you
someday will try the command on a multi-processor machine, and being
excited about all its power, place something like '-j2' in the line,
heaven knows what you'll get.
'-s' is for 'silent' builds, and turns off displaying of the executed
commands (not for version generation, though, very incovenient problem
in the kbuild-2.4).
