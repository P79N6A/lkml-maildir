You want to throttle IO if the amount of on flight data is higher than
a given percentage of _main memory_. 
As far as I can see, your patch avoids each individual queue from being
bigger than the high watermark (which is a percentage of main
memory). However, you do not avoid multiple queues together from being
bigger than the high watermark.
