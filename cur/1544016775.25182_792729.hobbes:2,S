Given that the subtree may have been in development for a long time, it
is almost a certainty that the older commits may compile on A but not
on C.  By basing it all on C you create a lot of uncompilable commits
which hurt bisection just as bad.  At least with missing kernel sources
it is obvious that an attempt at compilation is futile and a waste of
time.
