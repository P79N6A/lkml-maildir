I really like encrypted swap, it should already work fine, I think we
should make it the default. The cpu cost during swapping should be
really not significant. It's needed anyways for running suspend on a
laptop (currently suspend dumps into the swap the cleartext key of any
cryptoloop device, making cryptoloop pretty much useless).  And the good
thing is that it won't even need to ask for a password.
