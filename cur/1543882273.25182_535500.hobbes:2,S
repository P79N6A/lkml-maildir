Virtual mappings for larger pages? Or some software simulated form? This 
all sounds like awful hacks.

You are redefining the problem. We need larger physical sizes to support 
the hardware. Yes. We can dodge the issue with shim layers and hacks. It 
is obvious from the kernel sources that this is needed.

The patch does the obvious... Nothing is silly about memory being 
contigous in memory and on disk.
