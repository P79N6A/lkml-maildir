No, I wasn't using any patches...

They are random in the sense that HDLC depends on WAN but only
HDLC was being selected.  In theory I would have expected
config (software) to automatically enable higher-level config
symbols in this case (select HDLC to cause select WAN),
but that doesn't happen, so we got some "random" config
which isn't supported (or even valid) ("random" being "invalid"
in this case).
