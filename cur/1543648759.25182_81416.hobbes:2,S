Hello Niels,
This is the sort of facility which can easily go on top of the existing
LTT infrastructure (
http://www.opersys.com/LTT
) since most of the events
you need are already cleanly caught by LTT. If we'd reintegrate the
event callback mechanisms we removed on Ingo Molnar's request (albeit
exporting them as GPLonly this time), systrace would then be easily
maintained as a loadable kernel module. In addition, since LTT already
has appropriate hooks for 6 architectures, systrace would immediately
become available on those archs (i386, PPC, S/390, ARM, MIPS, SH).
