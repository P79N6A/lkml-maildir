Hello, everybody!
So far I have spoken to Jari Ruusu <jariruusu@users.sourceforge.net> who
is maintaining loop-AES and to Matthew Dharm <mdharm-usb@one-eyed-alien.net>
who
seems to be maintaining usb-storage at the moment.
Jari Ruusu helped me by locating the whereabouts of the following bug by
reading
my syslogs with debugging output from usb-storage and by providing some kernel
patches to isolate the error:
I am using a harddisk attached via a cardbus usb 2.0 card. On it I have an
encrypted partition which I access via loop-AES.
I can easily reproduce a complete deadlock in the usb-storage system by
mounting
my encrypted partition or copying files to or from it (depends on
configuration).

I did without posting my kernel config and my syslog files with the usb-storage
messages as according to the FAQ this would be overkill.
If anybody is willing to help me I  would gratefully send her/him all my logs
and my previous correspondence on this topic :)
Greetings from Berlin && excuses for my bad English,
