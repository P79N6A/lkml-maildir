Subject: [PATCH 2.6.7] new NVIDIA libata SATA driver
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/6/16/266

This patch adds the file linux-2.6.7/drivers/scsi/sata_nv.c, updates
linux-2.6.7/drivers/scsi/Makefile and linux-2.6.7/drivers/scsi/Kconfig
to include the new driver, and removes
PCI_DEVICE_ID_NVIDIA_NFORCE2S_SATA, PCI_DEVICE_ID_NVIDIA_NFORCE3S_SATA,
and PCI_DEVICE_ID_NVIDIA_NFORCE3S_SATA2 device IDs from the
linux-2.6.7/drivers/ide/pci/amd74xx.c driver (these IDs will now be in
the sata_nv.c driver).
This patch is to be applied to the linux-2.6.7 kernel.
Attaching patch file, as the patch is kind of large.
