I've been looking at this for a few minutes now and wondering - since sysfs is 
an integrated part of the new module system there isn't an easy solution in 
the KConfig system. Perhaps providing a stub function that does nothing for 
builds that have sysfs turned off would be better...
Either that, or leave the function in and have its function depend, in some 
function, on whether sysfs was loaded as a module or isn't present at all. 
Truthfully, though, I don't know if that's possible.
