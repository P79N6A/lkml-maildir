  Thanks.

  Probably it does not make sence to commit such transactions and we might
save some time in sync paths if we do so. So yes, I think skipping empty
transaction commit might be worthwhile and it shouldn't be hard to do
either. But I'd give it serious testing just in case some unexpectedly
relies on this behaviour - wouldn't this interfere e.g. with sync
transaction batching autotuning code? Untested patch below...
