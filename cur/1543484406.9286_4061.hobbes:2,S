Hi,
I finally got around to trying Oliver's patchnames patch, but didn't like
it (it confused the hell out of my start-up scripts when try to depmod,
for one).. Some people suggested a /proc/patches, so I implemented this:
it reads the first line of the patchdesc.foo files that were being suggested
and makes them available in /proc/patches. It also adds a single '+' to
the kernel version to indicate it's not 'vanilla':
loth:~# cat /proc/patches
ntfsmemfix: Misc NTFS memory fixes, Steve Dodd  Jan 27 1999
patchlist: /proc/patches support, Steve Dodd  Feb 4 1999
It's almost certainly not doing things the Right Way, especially in the
top-level Makefile, but it seems to work, and will help me keep track of
what I'm running and where...
