Hi Bart,
here's the first batch of conversion patches. Now ide_issue_pc/ide_transfer_pc
are almost completely aligned to their ide-cd counterparts
cdrom_start_packet_command/cdrom_transfer_packet_command. The only thing
missing is the setting of the irq handler through ide_set_handler but this
is not that trivial since if i'd moved ide-cd's irq handler to ide-atapi
that would suck in a bunch of other ide-cd functions which is not what we
want, (yes/no)? and I'm going to have to ponder a little bit more on that.
Those have been lightly tested with ide-cd and ide-floppy.
