Another example of stuff breaking on my system:  *** Netscape ***
I run Netscape Messenger 4.72.  When I open a message, I get this error:
	XF86BigfontQueryFont: could not attach shm segment.
NOTE:  I am running XFree86 3.9.18.  I have not recompiled XFree86
	since installing kernel 2.3.51.  Not sure if this matters.
Thanks,
	Miles
