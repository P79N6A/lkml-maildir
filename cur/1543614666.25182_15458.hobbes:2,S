Someone (I forget who) took a run-through about 6 months back.
AFAIK, they still sit in the last -ac tree, and not all (if any) of them
got merged. If I get bored/desperate for patches to merge, I'll resurrect
them for -dj. There are some other bits I keep meaning to dig out of
Alans old tree, so if you decide to go do this and just bring these in
sync for 2.5, I've no problem putting them in -dj until such a time
for them to get maintainer-review/testing/merging.
The kernel-janitor list archives should hold copies of some of them.
(See the sf page for details)
