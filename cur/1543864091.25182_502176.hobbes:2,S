argh.
Seems I have to wade through half the paper to understand Table 2.

Ratios, please..  that 100ns appears to be a 100% increase.  ie 100ns -> 200ns.
There are a couple of ways of working out how much that really matters: a)
run a workload or b) instrument a kernel, work out how many times/sec the
kernel runs rcu_read_lock().  I suspect b) would be more useful and
informative.
Either way, please always prepare such info up-front and summarise in the
changelog?  It's kinda important...
