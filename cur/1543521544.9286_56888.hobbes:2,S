And in the mean time, just as many new applications will come
along, both open and closed source that use time_t as it is now,
and after 15 years we will have just as many problems anyways.
You can't beam the Y2038 time_t "don't do this" solution into
every programmer's head simultaneously.  Saying "well it is their
fault for not following our recommendations" is also fruitless
because the goal is to not have computer problems, and casting
blame after the fact, does not solve the problem.

Now that is a fairly good idea I think.  Database data however
that is non-compliant now will need to be fixed, as well the
software that accesses that data.

Again, what about databases?  The data inside them that is, that
is stored as 32bit int?  Now it must be 64bit.  Database
conversion software needs to be written.

I think that is way way too long.

Personally, I think the same fiasco that happened for Y2K will
again repeat in 2038.  People will leave it to the last possible
second and then rush to try and fix the problem.  If they do as
good as Y2K allegedly "seems" to have done (only time will tell)
then we won't have a problem.  ;o)
