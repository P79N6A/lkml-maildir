Hmm... I don't undestand this. We can delay CPU_DOWN if we cancel cache_reaper
like you did in the previous patch. Did you mean this? If yes - then yes :)

Worse, we can have 2 handlers running in parallel on the same CPU. But this
is fixed by your previous patch, I believe.

Yep. For example, next_reap_node() will not be happy if we change CPU in
the middle. But this is _extremely_ unlikely, can only happen on CPU_DOWN,
and cache_reap() should not care about this.

Actually, I was wrong. Yes, this should work, but only with your previous
patch. Otherwise, if the handler runs on the "wrong" CPU (this is not possible
since you added cancel_delayed_work()), we are in fact starting a second reaper
on the same CPU, not good.
