The cleanest solution is to terminate the process. If the user has 
configured the process to only run on a certain cpu and the processor then 
becomes unavailable then the process needs to terminate by default since 
it has no resource left to run. This is similar to an Out of Memory 
condition.
We can add this sigstop_on_cpu_lost as an additional measure but it should 
be off by default. So far we have never had the system stop a process 
because resources are not available. This would be unexpected system 
behavior.
