Subject: [PATCH 1/2] Fix possible UDF data corruption

  Hi Andrew,
  attached patch fixes possible data corruption in UDF - this bug was actually
introduced by one of my fixes :-( and should (if possible) go to Linus before
2.6.22 is out (that's why I'm diffing against Linus's tree and not the
latest changes in -mm tree)... Thanks.

update_next_aext() could possibly rewrite values in elen and eloc, possibly
leading to data corruption when rewriting a file. Use temporary variables
instead. Also advance cur_epos as it can also point to an indirect extent
pointer.
