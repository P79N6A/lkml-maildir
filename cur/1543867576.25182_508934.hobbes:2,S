Loading a driver is not at issue.  Anyone may load a driver.
The issue is when you *distribute* a driver.
If that driver is a derived work or the Linux kernel, then you may
only distribute it under the terms of the GPLv2, which essentially
means that you make the source code available - under the GPLv2 - to
everyone you give the driver to.
How do you know if the driver is a derived work?
 Well, if it uses POSIX syscalls only, it isn't. (You can write USB
 drivers in user-space which do this).
 If it uses symbols exported with EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL, then the author of the
 code which provides those symbols thinks that the driver is a derived
 work.
 If it uses EXPORT_SYMBOL symbols, then it is less clear what people
 believe, though there are certainly some who believe it will still
 be a derived work.
But of course the person who's opinion really counts is the judge.  So
you need to get legal advice.
