Yes and no. LTT is just profiling too. Both of them are making people
notice because they allow that system profiling work to be done by 
two-banana grade operations staff not by the company wizard.
Neither are perfect - users want a "why is it going slow button"
with a "make it work" and "beat the crap out of the user who caused it"
option set.
"Profiling for the people" as it were.. (as opposed to the current
fad of 'profiling the people')
