When benchmarking CGI on web servers, it is common to include a sleep(3)
or so call somewhere in the script.
Maybe this can most easily be done on the client side with a few lines
of perl (or C) like:
#!/usr/bin/perl
# initialize everything, then loop over some set of files and do ...
while (sysread (FTP,$buf,100)) {
	sleep 1;
	$download .= $buf;
};
print LOG "failed\n" unless &check_if_correct ($download);
