Hi,
Ext2 and Ext3 filesystem go to inconsistent status by
simple test program on my system.
My test program is a script that extract a tar+gzip archive
twice and compare them, and remove one of the tree, and then
another extracting, and compare them again. A very simple test.
Following is an Ext2 result and the inode is filled by zero.
I think the inode becomes a badinode.

I saw same thing on Ext3 before.
I use RedHat9 which kernel is 2.4.20-8 and I also tried
2.4.20-19.9(redhat kernel patch rpm).
I want to know whether it is a redhat kernel problem or a generic
Ext problem and on which version it is fixed.
Mkfs parameter is just default of /sbin/mkfs.ext2 and mkfs.ext3,
and I use DELL 1650's internal SCSI disks for this test:

I will attach my script. I use Mozilla's tar archive.
Edit the first three lines for your use.
In the example above, the inode structure was cleared by zero, and
some time the data area was broken. Also I saw an inode overwritten
by deleted inode(which nlink=0 and i_dtime is on).
My feeling is that the broken buffers were used for some other
purpose and destroyed without having right LOCK of the buffer.
Here is my script:
---
#!/bin/bash
TARGETPREFIX=/mnt/foo   # filesystem that will be tested
MOZSRC=/home/tsuchiya/src/mozilla-source-1.3.tar.gz     # tgz used for test
RDIR="/tmp/xcresult"    # result directory
function _xtract+compare {
        echo "extracting directory to be compared against for $1"
        TARGETDIR=$TARGETPREFIX/$1
        mkdir -p $TARGETDIR
        cd $TARGETDIR
        tar zxf $MOZSRC
        echo "$1 done .... now the job is started."
        RESULTS=$RDIR/$1
        echo "test result will be stored under $RESULTS"
        mkdir -p $RESULTS;
        for ((i=0; i < 100000; i++))
        do
                echo "$1:$i-th trial"
                echo "test dir is $TARGETDIR";
                mkdir -p $TARGETDIR;
                cd $TARGETDIR
                mkdir dir$i
                cd dir$i
                tar zxf $MOZSRC
                diff -rq $TARGETDIR/mozilla mozilla > $RESULTS/dir$i.result 2>&1
                DIFFSIZE=`ls -l $RESULTS/dir$i.result | awk '{print $5}'`
                if [ $DIFFSIZE != 0 ];
                then
                        echo "something wrong happened at $1:$i-th trial "
                        exit;
                else
                        rm $RESULTS/dir$i.result
                        echo "test $1:$i-th passed"
                fi
                rm -rf mozilla &
        done

Any information would be appreciated.
