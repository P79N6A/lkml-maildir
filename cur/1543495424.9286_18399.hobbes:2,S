ok, well that patch didn't compile unforutnately... 
but I do have some more oopses and stuff but I recompiled the kernel so
the system map is different (?)  the last oops was from a tar process
(backup!) trying to access /dev/nst0 .  the tape drive is now completely
bound to the process so I will have to reboot before tonight so backups
will work
This is getting fscking irritating and I'm this close || to installing
solaris... ;(
Cheers
Craig
