The scheduler doesn't scale too well...

The most captivating arguments are along the following lines:
	- scales perfectly across NUMA fabrics: there are a number of 
	  upcoming architechures (hammer, power4, others) where the 
	  latency costs on remote memory are significantly higher.  By
	  making the entire kernel local, we'll see optimal performance 
	  for local operations, with good performance for the remote 
	  actions (the ccClusterFS should be very low overhead).
	- opens up a number of possibilities in terms of serviceability: 
	  if a chunk of the system is taken offline, only the one kernel 
	  group has to go away.  Useful in containing failures.
	- lower overhead for SMP systems.  We can use UP kernels local 
	  to each CPU.  Should make kernel compiles faster. ;-)
At the very least it is well worth investigating.  Bootstrapping the 
ccCluster work shouldn't take more than a week or so, which will let 
us attach some hard numbers to the kind of impact it has on purely 
cpu local tasks.
