there is nothing performance-counter specific about /dev/msr. There is no
highlevel performance-counter logic in the kernel. So if the kernel
decides to use one of them, that should not be more of a problem than some
other user already using the performance counter. You can simply turn
performance counters off via /dev/msr, just like you would clear them
prior use anyway. If there was some existing kernel-based API to give
unpriviledged access to performance counters then i would agree - but
right now it takes extra action by a knowledgable root to use /dev/msr.

making an extra config option unnecessery litters the kernel with #ifdefs.
Why should it be a config option beyond CONFIG_X86_APIC if our goal is to
run it on as many boxes as possible?
