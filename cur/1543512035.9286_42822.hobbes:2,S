Be fair:
  - it doesn't impact drivers unless the developer chooses to use devfs
  - it doesn't impact system adminstration unless you enable the feature
  - it doesn't break filesystem semantics anymore than /proc already does
  - UNIX devices aren't the best: tradition for tradition's sake is crazy
Also just because you don't add/remove devices very often doesn't mean you
are the poster child for all Linux users. I don't have any need for initrd
but I wouldn't dare argue it should be removed for this reason alone.

Be fair:
  - gives sensible names to devices (c1t3d0s2 instead of sde)
  - eliminates scsi ordering problems because of sensible names
  - completely eliminates major/minor number problems 
  - moves naming complexity INTO USER SPACE (good for usb)
  - user space scripts ran on insertion (just like cardmgr/PCMCIA)
  - UNIX-like /dev without UNIX-like rw fs (good for embedding on romfs)
  - provides a proper namespace (no need for recent rash of /proc/*/dev)
Notice that all of these problems can be solved in other ways (for example
you can solve the sde -> c1t3d0s2 problems using a startup script, similar
to how Solaris populates /dev) but devfs solves ALL of the problems in one
fell swoop.

Well, perhaps all kernel developers should stop coding right now: you have
equally well argued against all new features and drivers.
