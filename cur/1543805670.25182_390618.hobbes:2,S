It's the s390 debug feature in arch/s390/kernel/debug.c. It's completely in
the mainline tree.

Links should be 3, I thought? For an empty directory it's 2 and as soon as
you create a new directory in there it should be increased by 1. Therefore
it should be 3. Or am I missing something?
Btw.: my find version: "GNU find version 4.2.20".
