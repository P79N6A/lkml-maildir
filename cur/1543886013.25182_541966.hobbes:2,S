The Motorola VME boards are the only ones I am aware of.  I must also add
that the partitions themselves are sysv partitions.

Feel free to replace or suppress the `default' directive.  I actually wrote
that for a i586 laptop to access/reinstall disks of sysV68 machines using
a USB/SCSI adapter, but I don't think `default y' is a good idea :).
What do you think of
	`default y if VME'
or
	`default y if M68K && SYSV_FS'
