It might in the future be needed for refcounting, I originally added it
when I thought it was needed.
But what it really does today is create the symlink from the driver to
the module that is contained in it, in sysfs.  Which is very invaluable
for people who want to know these things (installer programs, etc.)
For example:
$ tree /sys/bus/pci/drivers/uhci_hcd/
/sys/bus/pci/drivers/uhci_hcd/
|-- 0000:00:1d.0 -> ../../../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.0
|-- 0000:00:1d.1 -> ../../../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.1
|-- 0000:00:1d.2 -> ../../../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.2
|-- 0000:00:1d.3 -> ../../../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.3
|-- bind
|-- module -> ../../../../module/uhci_hcd
|-- new_id
`-- unbind
That "module" symlink is created only if the .owner field is set.
That's why people are going through and adding it to all of the drivers
in the system.
Hope this helps,
