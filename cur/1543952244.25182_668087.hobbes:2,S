Make sure that it is actually using multiple processes or threads, if it was 
only using a single thread the number could be that low, and a number of really 
trivial things being wrong could cause it to only be using one thread.  "top -H" 
will show threads.
Is the HPL executable identical (the same executable should work just fine so 
long as the underlying HW is the same, so no need to recompile/relink xhpl)?
And you might also try Intel's MKL with hpl and see if that is better or worse 
than gotoblas (this probably won't affect the problem, but it would be good to 
know if the Intel MKL is better or worse than gotoblas).
Also, as the other person mentioned use git bisect and figure out which patch 
did it, if you can identify one patch someone can probably figure it out.
