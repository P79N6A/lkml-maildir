Each layer with its own pointer structure adds additional pointers
because in a single tree system the depth of accesses is log N, but in a
two tree system the depth is 2 log(N/2), which is much more than log N.
Each layer of interface adds a layer of functionality distortion, and
the capabilities of a two layer system is in some ways the intersection
not the union of the separate capabilities of the layers.
Recovery is necessarily much uglified, more than twice as ugly, and this
makes performance worse since performance normally has recovery as the
primary crippling factor that prevents the use of various desired
algorithms.
