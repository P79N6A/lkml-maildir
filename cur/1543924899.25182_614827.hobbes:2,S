You were the one who suggested to _parse_ strings in the kernel.
Some basic parsing is possible due to the fact that all encodings you 
usually get are extensions of ASCII with additional properties.
But in this thread we discussed that the following implemented things
in Smack and TOMOYO currently do not work correctly when the string
is encoded in UTF-8:
- isgraph()
- isspace()
- match one character
How do you suggest to implement them in a safe way without knowing about 
the encoding?
