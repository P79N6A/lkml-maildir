"the only"???
You clearly haven't been paying attention. Lots of computers vary the
clock rate. They do this several ways.
There may be sudden long-term changes, as when a laptop is unplugged.
The OS will not be told; there will just be timing errors.
Transitions may be gradual. The Opteron documentation describes a
procedure that involves stepping voltage and frequency, bit by bit,
waiting at each stage for the frequency to stabilize.
There is often a sawtooth wave wobble, added to spread the spectrum
of RF emmisions.
Clock ticks get lost all the time. The BIOS may decide do grab the
CPU in SMM (system management mode) for many milliseconds at a time.
It's cool to have a faster way to do things, but not if that way is
typically defective and enabled by default. The default should just
work, no "if"s "and"s or "but"s about it.
