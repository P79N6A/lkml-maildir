Below is the shortlog of patches currently queued in wireless-2.6 for the
2.6.19 merge window.  This message is a heads-up for those interested in
taking a closer look.
There aren't any big items at the moment.  These are mostly improvements
to the bcm43xx and zd1211rw drivers, along with some other miscellaneous
improvements to the softmac infrastructure and other drivers.
FYI!
