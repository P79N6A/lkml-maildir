We were discussing this topic again and thought it should be reported here. As 
you are probably aware, the file 
linux-2.6.16.tar.bz2/linux-2.6.16/drivers/net/hydra.h
contains a BSD 4 license. This was discussed on bugs.debian.org and on the 
debian legal mailing list - see 
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=242895
The debian people were of the opinion that this was fixed - "We believe that 
the bug you reported is fixed in the latest version of
kernel-source-2.6.7". I would just like to inquire as to the official status 
of this and would be grateful for any answer.
