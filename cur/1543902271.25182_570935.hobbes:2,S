Yes, my experience has been that it has been almost chillingly close
to .5k per regular file increase in partition size. I know in
applications in which size is utterly critical this may be slightly
unattractive, but in cases where romfs is chosen for its byte
reproducibility and read-only nature the size/performance tradeoff is
fairly advantageous.
