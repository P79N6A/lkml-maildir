correct. E.g. 2.6.7-mm7 already has the patch so for that tree there's
no cfq-iosched.c change in the voluntary-preempt patch. And for
2.6.7-vanilla there's a big cfq-iosched.c delta to include the other
improvements from Jens as well on which the bugfix depends.
the patch didnt really trigger the bug itself, it triggered an annoying
debugging message instead ;)
