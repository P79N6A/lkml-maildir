If these reports are true, they would be worrying. But I find them a bit
hard to believe - the bit combinations don't appear to make sense.
I have an AMD64 machine which logs 'MCE reported' every once in a while but
otherwise functions perfectly and I haven't yet coaxed it into telling me
the content of the errors.
Might there be a bug here? How did you create this log?

This would be one hell of an error - both corrected and uncorrected.
