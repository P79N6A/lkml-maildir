But then it's not *truly* transparent, is it?
And that leaves another question - if you make a config file that excludes
all the .o files - then what's backing the .o files?  Those data blocks need
to be *someplace*.  Maybe you can do something ugly like use unionfs to
combine your gitfs with something else to store the other files...
But at that point, you're probably better off just creating a properly
designed versioning filesystem.
