Oops, the command is actually "find /usr | xargs wc", witch causes lots of 
disk activity.

Offtopic, but why isn't the policy the same for all NICs ?

Both IA-64, but that's the only common point.

None that I am aware of.
I run:
# dd if=/dev/random bs=1 count=1 | od
 
Another shell:
# lsof /dev/random
COMMAND  PID USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE  NODE NAME
dd      1496 root    0r   CHR    1,8      99952 /dev/random
Now, find /usr | xargs wc running in background.
About /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail:

After 10 minutes, dd is still running.
This is on Linux 2.6.12-rc1-bk1, same results for 2.6.12-rc2.
And /dev/random works fine on the same machine with Linux 2.6.11.
(i.e when running "find /usr | xargs wc", /dev/random spits out lots of 
bytes)
