Subject: [2.5 patch] let MTD_UCLINUX depend on !MMU
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Trying to compile a kernel with MTD_UCLINUX enabled for a computer with
a MMU fails at the final linking because the variable _ebss seems to be
not defined on such machines (it's only defined on m68knommu, h8300 and 
v850).
The following patch (still applies with a few lines offset against 
2.5.69-bk4) tries to correct this issue by letting MTD_UCLINUX depend on 
!MMU.
