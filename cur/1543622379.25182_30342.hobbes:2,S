Hi folks,
kernel nfsd in 2.4.18-rc4 isn't working when started via the distribution's boot scripts, and I don't know, how to set it up manually. I don't blame the distro's script, but it is a SuSE 7.3.
I think, it is a kernel issue.
2.4.17 worked, 2.4.18-rc4 was the first, who showed this misbehaviour.
Maybe, it is final relevant?
Thanks in advance,
Johnny
I get the following errors:
RPC: Unable to receive; errno = Connection refused
startproc:  exit status of parent of /usr/sbin/rpc.mountd: 1
In dmesg, I see:
