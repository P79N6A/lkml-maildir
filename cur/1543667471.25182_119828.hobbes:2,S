SDET is rather irritating because a) nobody has a copy and b) we don't even
know what it does.

But judging by this, it's a rebadged dbench.  The profile is identical.
Note that the lock_kernel() contention has been drastically reduced and we're
now hitting semaphore contention.
Running `dbench 32' on the quad Xeon, this patch took the context switch rate
from 500/sec up to 125,000/sec.
I've asked Alex to put together a patch for spinlock-based locking in the
block allocator (cut-n-paste from ext2).
That will fix up lock_super(), but I suspect the main problem is the
lock_journal() in journal_start().  I haven't thought about that one yet.
