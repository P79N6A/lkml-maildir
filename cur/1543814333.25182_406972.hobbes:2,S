Just for the record: this wasn't my bug... :)

The iv.tv64 test is only needed for the SIGEV_NONE case, so one could also 
move it to the end:
	if ((timr->it_requeue_pending & REQUEUE_PENDING) ||
	    ((timr->it_sigev_notify & ~SIGEV_THREAD_ID) == SIGEV_NONE && iv.tv64))
OTOH since it_requeue_pending is unused for SIGEV_NONE, we could as well 
initialize it during timer_set:
	if (timr->it_sigev_notify & ~SIGEV_THREAD_ID) == SIGEV_NONE)
		timr->it_requeue_pending == interval.tv64 ? REQUEUE_PENDING : 0;
and make the test even simpler.

It's maybe practically not relevant, but theoretically a (iv.tv64) would 
be more correct and then we could also move it up to the initial (iv.tv64) 
test and leave the (remaining.tv64 > 0) case here.
