saving my time instead of commenting your code does not mean i am not 
into it. as far as i remember i did say, that the api mixup within
dvb-core is NOT wanted and there are solutions for other devices,
that show it can be done otherwise. i must admit it would be a different
way but the only answer you said was "No, i wont do that"
please go back through the irc logs on linuxtv.org and find the 
appropiate place.

as you may remember, i also offered you to ack a MERGE AS IS base for
your code in a private conversation on irc.
the main topics in there have been:
merge your stuff
wait for multiproto applied (as i still think it is a better solution)
rework your stuff to work with multiproto
your answer was afair "i will not allow anyone to modify my code after a 
merge"
that showed me, others did recognise meanwhile too, that you are NOT 
able to discuss different things or opinions for real, but you take
your proposals as the "one and only". this can not work, and will not
work.
i will leave this discussion again, as discussing with you mostly just 
leads into the old story of how stupid linuxtv devs are...
YOU LEFT linuxtv to build up your own - proceed further with that 
strategy _or_ come back to a level where you are open for different 
suggestions than yours.
