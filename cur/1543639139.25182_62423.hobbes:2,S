Don't forget the old sun workstations that keep MAC addresses in
nvram, where it's setable via the boot prom.  I had one with a bad
battery that I had to reset the MAC address on by hand if I unplugged
it for too long.
They DID implement a check to make sure the first few bits were
correct for the product, though.  I couldn't pick completely random
MACs (though C0FFEE fit nicely at the end).
Given a working nvram, this change was "permanent", and the only tools
needed came with the system.
