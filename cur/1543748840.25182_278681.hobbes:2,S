The most portable way to do this is to have the first member of the 
structure be a 32-bit value containing the size of the structure.  This 
can then be used to identify what the structure format is.  This also 
has the advantage of future-proofing the interface (add a field?  no 
problem, the new size can be checked for).  Just be very careful that 
the size from userspace is not trusted (ie. only allow known sizes).
