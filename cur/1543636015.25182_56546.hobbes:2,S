It's not a different value in libproc. There's autodetection.
I can't just support "the majority of ARM", and people keep
giving me shit about HZ supposedly being a per-arch constant.
(not that there's a sane way to get a per-arch constant from
user code anyway)

You have 64, 128, and 1000. See for yourself.
arch-cl7500/param.h     #define HZ 100
arch-epxa10db/param.h   #define HZ 100
arch-integrator/param.h #define HZ 100
arch-l7200/param.h      #define HZ 128
arch-shark/param.h      #define HZ 64
arch-tbox/param.h       #define HZ 1000
I need to support all of that with one binary.
So I'm stuck with:
  case    9 ...   11 :  Hertz =   10; break; /* S/390 (sometimes) */
  case   18 ...   22 :  Hertz =   20; break; /* user-mode Linux */
  case   30 ...   34 :  Hertz =   32; break; /* ia64 emulator */
  case   48 ...   52 :  Hertz =   50; break;
  case   58 ...   62 :  Hertz =   60; break;
  case   63 ...   65 :  Hertz =   64; break; /* StrongARM /Shark */
  case   95 ...  105 :  Hertz =  100; break; /* normal Linux */
  case  124 ...  132 :  Hertz =  128; break; /* MIPS, ARM */
  case  195 ...  204 :  Hertz =  200; break; /* normal << 1 */
  case  253 ...  260 :  Hertz =  256; break;
  case  393 ...  408 :  Hertz =  400; break; /* normal << 2 */
  case  790 ...  808 :  Hertz =  800; break; /* normal << 3 */
  case  990 ... 1010 :  Hertz = 1000; break; /* ARM */
  case 1015 ... 1035 :  Hertz = 1024; break; /* Alpha, ia64 */
  case 1180 ... 1220 :  Hertz = 1200; break; /* Alpha */
