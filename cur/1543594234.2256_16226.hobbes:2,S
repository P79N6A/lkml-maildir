I never had doubt that you could do the same in userspace using the
zorocopy functionality (see the old threads with Jeff V. Merkey and
netware when I was saying you don't need it in kernel) so in theory I
totally agree since the first place...

... but in practice x15 is nor open source nor free software and I'd
prefer to have an open choice. I wouldn't even think to merge tux if
zope, apache, thttpd would run as fast as tux of course.
