I was the original complainer - and came to the same conclusion: that
windows wiped my stuff. I gathered it up from:
A. After booting to windows and back to 2.4.0 all was lost and the kernel
   couldn't even mount / and didn't even try /home, which was wiped, too
   (used 2.2 debian boot disks to verify that, at the time).
B. I rebuilt everything and am using 2.4.0 kernel now without any serious
   flaws (using VIA 868B UDMA33). And I'm definitely not trying to win 98
   again..
C. the wiped partition had TrueType(tm) fonts in lost+found. I can't
   think of any other reason for that except that they're from windows'
   swapping process.
...
Z. Windows 98 generally doesn't have very good architecture concerning
   drivers. It looks nice, but is a mess underneath (proved numerous times
   by trying to upgrade an old windows installation to a new machine).
