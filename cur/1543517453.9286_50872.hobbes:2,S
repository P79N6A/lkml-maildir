Most likely their "support people" never got any training beyond clicking
on "setup.exe" and they know no other way to answer customer questions
(if they knew, they would obviously just have dumped the specs to the
pcmcia folks together with a bouqet of hardware to test the drivers...)
Well just let'em know that they just put themselves on the "don't buy" list
for whatever organisation you are representing... If enough people do this,
they will eventually realise that they are loosing potential business.
