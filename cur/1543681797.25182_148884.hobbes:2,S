I have also tried using CONFIG_FB_VGA16 as a module (so it's not loaded
by default) and I get the same results.
In /arch/i386/boot/video.S 
CONFIG_VIDEO_VESA is defined. CONFIG_VIDEO_SVGA is the only one not
defined.
Setting it in my .config file didn't seem to work. (I may be doing
something dumb here...) It resulted in a warning message ".config:1318:
trying to assign nonexistent symbol VIDEO_VESA"
Trying to boot using vga=794 didn't help either.
I have the binary NVIDIA driver working. I used the 2.5/2.6 patches.
Thanks for your help,
David St.Clair
