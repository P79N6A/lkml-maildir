Why do you worry about installers? New distro - new kernel - new
installer
that's they job to worry about it. They will change the installer anyway
and this kind of change actually is going to simplyfy the code there, I
think,
a bit.
Just kill the old device major suddenly and place it in the changelog
of the new kernel that the user should mknod and add it to /dev/fstab
before rebooting into the new kernel. Hey that's developement anyway :-)
If the developer boots back into the old kernel just other mounts
 in /dev/fstab will fail no problem for transition here in sight...
