Subject: [PATCH] sata_nv: don't use legacy DMA in ADMA mode (v3)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/25/118

We need to run any DMA command with result taskfile requested in ADMA mode
when the port is in ADMA mode, otherwise it may try to use the legacy DMA engine
in ADMA mode which is not allowed. Enforce this with BUG_ON() since data
corruption could potentially result if this happened. Also, fail any attempt to
try and issue NCQ commands with result taskfile requested, since the hardware
doesn't allow this.
