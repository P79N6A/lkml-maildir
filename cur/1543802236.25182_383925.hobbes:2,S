You only take the spinlocks corresponding to the current lock. What about
the next locks in the chain? Remember those locks might not be
futexes but a lock inside the kernel, taken in system calls. I.e. the
robust_sem might not protect you.
If there are n locks you need to lock n lock->wait_lock and n
owner->task->pi_lock as you traverse the locks. That is what I tried to
sketch in the examble below.
