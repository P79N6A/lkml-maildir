The serial core implements many of the details of a tty
driver in a common place so that individual hardware drivers
(serial drivers) only need implement the hardware specific code.
This prevents duplicating tty logic in many drivers,
with the possibility of mistakes/inconsistency in the
different tty drivers.
The stand alone tty drivers are mostly legacy code from
the time before serial core that have not been ported
to be a serial drivers.
