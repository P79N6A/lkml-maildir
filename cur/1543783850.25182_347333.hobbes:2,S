I was looking for that (but couldn't find it)..
At this point I don't see why it wouldn't, if that also syncs from the 
partition then it's basically the same functionality, but written from a 
different perspective.
To use it I'll have to deviate from stock linux and use a non-packaged 
mdadm, but that is better than applying my patch every kernel update ;-)
Thanks, I'll look into it.
