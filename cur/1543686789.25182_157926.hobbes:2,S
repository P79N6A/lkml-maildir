I can still starve xmms while running Blender ;-) Game-test
(yes, wine) impossible means it acts almost exactly as I wrote about in:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=106098091012383&w=2
We're talking many minutes of total starvation at each stage, start
- menu selection single player - load saved game menu - load game
(haven't had the patience to wait for an actual game to begin...)
Profile Blender? Ok, know nothing about the technique but will compile a
kernel with profiling and read up on what has been mentioned on this
list (Mr Erwin calling for proper "instrumentation")
Will take alot of time. I'll return any restults directly to your
address, won't copy lkml.
