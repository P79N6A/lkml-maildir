Linux's VM doesn't try to free used swap space, even there is plenty os
physical RAM available. If there are pages on swap, that is because at
some point in time those pages where considered "not used", and were
written to disk. If those pages are never reused, they stay where they
currently are, because it is the most interesting thing to do performace
wise. Trying to keep swap=0 could cause some ping-pong effect under some
workloads, with heavy access to disk, that are too slow to be accesed
more than strictly necessary.
