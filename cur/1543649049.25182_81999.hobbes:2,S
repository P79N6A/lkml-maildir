We will be incorporating lots of ideas and small code pieces
from USAGI's work, but most of the core engine will be a new
implementation.
A completely new CryptoAPI subsystem has been implemented so that
full lists of page vectors can be passed into the ciphers, which is
necessary for a clean IPSEC implementation.
It is intended that this work will be complete (it isn't done as I
type this) and pushed to Linus upon his return from vacation.
