I'm interested in using this for voyager.  However, I have a problem in
that voyager may have CPUs that can't accept interrupts (this is global
on voyager, but may be per-interrupt on NUMA like systems).  I think
before we move to a userspace solution, some thought about how to cope
with this is needed.
I have several suggestions:
1. Place the masks into /proc/irq/<n>/smp_affinity at start of day and
have the userspace irqbalancer take this as the maximal mask
2. Have a separate file /proc/irq/<n>/mask(?) to expose the mask always
3. Some other method...
Comments would be welcome
