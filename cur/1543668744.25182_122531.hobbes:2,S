What they say? It is completely legal to use NULL path in ncp_obtain_info,
and in reality ncp_obtain_mtime() in fs/ncpfs/dir.c uses NULL path 
explicitly (and it also checks for 'ncp_is_server_root(inode)', at least
in 2.5.66 and 2.4.19). See ncp_add_handle_path, it contains code which
converts NULL path to no path at all.
Do not you just have loaded some misguided antivirus software on your server? 
ncpfs uses inode based addressing scheme, where files are accessed by their 
numbers instead of name. Only thing which accesses files by name are 
validating functions, for converting name to number, and unlink (because of 
4.x servers crash when unlink by inode is invoked on NFS namespace).
