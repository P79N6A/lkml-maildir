This doesn't really work.  Neither the fast A20 gate nor the KBC is
guaranteed to have immediate effect (on most systems they won't.)
What's worse, once you have done an "out" to the KBC you need to
finish the sequence.  I need to think about this for a bit.
(Arguably, what you're doing is running on completely nonstandard
hardware, which may need a CONFIG_ option.  However, if we can avoid
it I guess it's better.)
