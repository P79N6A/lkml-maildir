Bert Hubert said a few days back:
| In the Configure HELP of Ethernet bridging:
|
| "Note that if your box acts as a bridge, it probably contains 
| several Ethernet devices, but the kernel is not able to recognize
| more than one at
| boot time without help; for details read the Ethernet-HOWTO, 
| available from in <
http://www.linuxdoc.org/docs.html#howto>."
|
| This is extremely bogus these days and prone to confuse people. 
| I suggest this warning is removed.
Sounds good, so here's the patch to 2.5.46 Kconfig to do that
if you want it.
