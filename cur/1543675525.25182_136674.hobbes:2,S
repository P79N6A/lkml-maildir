Or 99.9%, if you map all those workspaces to one, similar to my patch.
The softirq context requires another set of workspaces, but in
principle the same could be done.  Downside is that the Init- and End-
functions have to be called more often, which will surely cost cpu
time.  I haven't done any benchmarks yet, so it remains to be shown if
this is relevant.
Your approach basically reintroduces the zmalloc() and zfree()
functions and makes behaviour under memory pressure interesting.  It
is not impossible to get it right, but quite hard for sure.

Image a 2-cpu machine that does reads and writes to jffs2 on two
devices simultaneously.  When one process is reading and one is
writing, everything is fine.  When both perform the same operation,
the current design makes one wait at the semaphore, while one cpu is
idle.  In my design, you have one workspace per cpu, so both can work
simultaneously.
What contention were you talking about? :)
The bh lock is another issue.  Here we need another set of workspaces,
independent of the existing one (with or without my patch).  But in
principly, the same should be possible.
