Well yes, it's hard to compile userland stuff with
-I/usr/src/linux-4.1.2/include because /usr/include/net and
/usr/src/linux-4.1.2/include/net are 2 very different things.
I would like it very much if include/net and include/scsi in
the kernel source were renamed to say include/knet and include/kscsi
(or include/linux/net and include/linux/scsi)

It should probably go in /usr/src/linux-4.1.2/include/linux, so that it
still works if you have just the kernel headers installed and
not the entire source

Exactly

That's why it says "Point to kernel you want to build against". It
should probably look more like this:
# Point to include file directory of the kernel you want to build against
# A good default is /usr/src/linux/include
KERNELINC=/usr/src/linux-2.4.5/include
include $(KERNELINC)/linux/config.mk
CFLAGS := -I$(KERNELINC) $(CFLAGS)
I'm not sure about using /usr/src/linux-2.4.5/include or simply
/usr/src/linux-2.4.5 (the base directory). Oh well.
The README that comes with a module should tell you to edit the Makefile
and adjust the path to the kernel if you want to build against a
non-standard kernel. The default should probably be /usr/src/linux
for people who installed the running kernel and headers and/or source
straight from the rpm or deb and simply want to build a module.
That way, nothing depends on /usr/include/linux anymore.
So actually, we need 2 things:
- rename include/net and include/scsi in the kernel source.
  This is for the benefit of compiling userland programs against
  non-standard kernel headers
- generate a config.mk Makefile fragment when compiling the kernel
  that gets put in include/linux/config.mk (like config.h, really)
  This is for the benefit of compiling standalone modules
Note that this is probably the 6th time that this is discussed
and I am at least the 2nd person to come to this conclusion ;)
Mike.
