There are two separate issues here, and it looks like I'm discussing
one and you're discussing the other, so let me clarify...
 1. Dumping to floppy diskette. The routine to do this needs some
    way of knowing what capacity diskette is available, and the
    fact that the system has panicked indicates that the normal
    kernel detection routines will not be reliable.
    The obvious solution to this is to have the routine get these
    details when the system starts up, and also for it to have hooks
    into the mount/unmount routines so it can keep track of whether
    the floppy drive is currently mounted, and into the sync routine
    so it can sync any data to floppy before unmounting it.
 2. Dumping to hard disc. There is a veritable minefield of issues
    to deal with here, not least the fact that such assumes that the
    relevant controller subsystems are still working. I do not even
    intend to begin to wade into those murky waters, sorry.
Whilst I was discussing issue (1), your comments lead me to believe
you were discussing issue (2). Am I correct?
Best wishes from Riley.
