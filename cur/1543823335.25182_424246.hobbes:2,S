Who said anything about demanding? he wanted to discuss the paper. He
received no response (AFAIK). Please don't read more into it.

For security related information, it is sometimes best not to tell the
whole world about it immediately (although you should definitely tell
the whole world about it eventually). It should've probably been
posted to lkml when mpm didn't respond, I agree. I'll take the blame
for not suggesting that to Zvi.
