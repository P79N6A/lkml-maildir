OK, a few links and addresses for the people who are
interested in fighting the spam they see:
419/Nigeria scams should be forwarded (with complete headers) to
the US secret service, who are very interested because these scams
have indeed gotten people killed:
	United States Secret Service <419.fcd@usss.treas.gov>
Stock pump&dump scams are often very effectively handled by
sending them to:
	enforcement@sec.gov
What might also help for these is sending the spam to the
legal staff of the company, in addition to the SEC address.
Reminding the legal staff of the fact that the SEC might
suspend trading in their stock for a few days often gets
them moving against the spammer fairly quickly ;)
If you live in Washington state (and some other states too,
I believe) hunting season for spammers is literally open all
year. I think you can get up to $500/spam in Washington state:

Now, please stop bothering Matti and DaveM about it and
take action yourself ;)
cheers,
