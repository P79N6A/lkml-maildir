I'm seeing an oddity with floppy:
$ vdir /sys/devices/platform/floppy.0/
total 0
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root            0 May 21 22:43 block -> ../../../block/fd1
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root            0 May 21 22:43 block -> ../../../block/fd1
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root            0 May 21 22:43 bus -> ../../../bus/platform
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root         4096 May 21 22:43 detach_state
I suspect the first is actually supposed to be 'fd0' since:
$ vdir /sys/block/fd*/device
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root            0 May 21 22:52 /sys/block/fd0/device -> ../../devices/platform/floppy.0
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root            0 May 21 22:52 /sys/block/fd1/device -> ../../devices/platform/floppy.0
It seems that the block sysfs layer can't cope with one device having
multiple block devices hanging off it, which is the case with floppy
controllers.
Maybe a possible solution would be for the floppy driver to register
platform devices beneath the main device for each floppy drive?
