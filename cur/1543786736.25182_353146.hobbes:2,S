Without any source these numbers are not verifiable. You don't even 
mention here what that "representative piece of code" is...
Anyway, Thomas mentioned that this would be from the insert/remove code 
and here you omitted the most important part of my mail:
typedef union {
	u64 tv64;
	struct {
#ifdef __BIG_ENDIAN
		u32 sec, nsec;
#else
		u32 nsec, sec;
#endif
	} tv;
} ktimespec;
IOW this would allow to keep the time value in timespec format and use 
your nsec_t_ops for sorting.
bye, Roman
