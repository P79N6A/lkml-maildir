Hi,
It took a bit longer than I wanted, but here is finally another kconfig 
update. There are two important changes: I included Romain's gtk front 
end and the support for the menuconfig keyword. Unfortunately the first is 
lacking a bit support for the latter. Romain, you have to check that menu 
entries of type P_MENU can now also have a config symbol. I looked a bit 
at it myself but my gtk knowledge is insufficient. :)
Other changes are small parser fixes and the config list in qconf has a 
parent entry, so it should be more obvious, how to get to a parent menu.
I don't expect bigger problems, so I want to send this patch soon to 
Linus.
The patch is at

bye, Roman
