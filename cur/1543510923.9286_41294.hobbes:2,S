Sorry, but no.
If you do the following thing:
--- cut ---
main()
{
  unsigned char a;
  char b;
  b = -20;
  a=b;
  printf("%d\n", a);
}
--- cut ---
and you wonder about the "236" result, then you're either using the
wrong language which does not tell you about such hidden problems [1]
or you have problems understanding your code.
The _MAIN_ problem that I have with hungarian is, that it gives you a
false sense of security. So this is a "pv" (pointer to void). I read
it somewhere and then I assume "pointer to void". But it is still
perfectly legal to write "char pv;" and use this pv. So what do I get
from hungarian? Nothing.
If you need a language which enforces types with the variable names,
why not use Fortran? There is a "VisualFortran" for sure. ;-)
[1] I don't write bug. One man's bug is another man's obfuscation.
