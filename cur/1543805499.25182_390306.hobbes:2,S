The ACPI hotplug code already would refresh this apic id when the notify
for CPU hotplug is processed. 
Possibly we could add additional check to safegaurd buggy bios reporting 
bad apicid, as a safegaurd.  
The ACPI code when it processes a physical removal would remove this entry 
and replace with invalid id, and populate it when we process a physical 
hot-add.
(although i would say we tested this only on ia64 so far, the code is 
generic to x86_64 as well, but i havent gone around testing physical hotplug
via emulation patches we have internally)
