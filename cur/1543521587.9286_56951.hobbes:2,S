No, but it is an 8way machine, and to my knowledge, all 8way machines with
the possible exception of the very early Hitachi machines use a
combination of the Profusion chipset to allow 8 processors to be in the
same box, and some Compaq North Bridge chips that do the hot plug PCI.
The function that is oopsing is called specifically because your machine
has those Compaq Hot Plug PCI chipset north bridge chips in it.  Now, why
it's oopsing is beyond me because I'm behind the 2.3 kernel series...

      they should be everybody's.
