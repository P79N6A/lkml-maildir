Hi Jeff,
Thanks, that is very cool. The memory problems you're seeing aren't
actually a regression (it's always been like that), and I still haven't
got hold of some gigabit networking hardware to test it thoroughly, so
as such so it may be difficult to get this into 2.6.9. Hopefully soon
though.
I can provide you (or anyone) with up to date patches on request though,
so just let me know.

Scanning stats look good at a quick glance. kswapd doesn't seem to be
going crazy.
However,
size-65536         32834  32834  65536    1   16
This slab entry is taking up about 2GB of unreclaimable memory (order-4,
no less). This must be a leak... does the number continue to rise as
your system runs?
