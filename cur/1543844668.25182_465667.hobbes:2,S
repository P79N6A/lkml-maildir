Add an isa_device class and that'll fall into place nicely. isa_alloc_*
will end up asking for 20bit DMA and it will work nicely.

Implementation detail although I note that the defrag/antifrag proposal
made at the vm summit would mean it mostly come out for free. If we have
an isa_dma_* API then the detail is platform specific.

Just search within the candidate 4MB (or whatever it is these days)
chunks.

Various devices are 30 and 31bit today - some broadcom for example.

Ok the examples I know about are
- ESS Maestro series audio - PCI, common on 32bit boxes a few years ago,
no longer shipped and unlikely to be met on 64bit. Also slow allocations
is fine.
- Some aacraid, mostly only for control structures. Those found on 64bit
are probably fine with slow alloc.
- Broadcom stuff - not sure if 30 or 31bit, around today and on 64bit
- Floppy controller

I think its worthy of discussion.
