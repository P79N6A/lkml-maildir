Ok, after going through benchmarking for the last few days, I now  
started acutally deploying the system.
I created a RAID-5 with a 1.0 superblock and let the RAID resync.
I had to reboot the computer for another update and did not think  
about thw rebuilding process since it should continue just fine after  
a restart. After a reboot I noticed that the RAID was in the  
following state.

/proc/mdstat showed now progress bar though. Ok, since he seems stuck  
I thought, why not just mark sdd2 as failed.
I was able to mark it as failed but looking at the detail again I saw  
"spare rebuilding" and I could not remove it.
Next I tried a fail/remove which also did not work. I stopped the  
array started it again, and THEN it removed the disk.
I tried this several times, the same result every time.
Just for kicks I created the RAID with a 0.90 superblock and tried  
the same thing. Lo and behold after stopping the array and starting  
it again the progress bar showed up and everything started rebuilding  
where it stopped earlier.
Is this "normal" or is this a superblock 1.0 related problem?
Current kernel is 2.6.24.2, mdadm is v2.6.4 from debian unstable.
I do not need the RAID right now so I could run some tests on it if  
someone wants me too.
Kind regards,
