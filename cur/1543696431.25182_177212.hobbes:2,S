I also get this problem when compiling parted :
../../libparted/linux.c: In function `_device_get_length':
../../libparted/linux.c:407: error: parse error before '[' token
../../libparted/linux.c:407: warning: signed and unsigned type in conditional expression
make[4]: *** [linux.lo] Erreur 1
This error is due to the usage of BLKGETSIZE64 in linux/fs.h, which is
defined as :
  #define BLKGETSIZE64 _IOR(0x12,114,size_t)      /* return device size in bytes (u64 *arg) */
I understand that size_t should no more be used or something such, which
is way the _IOC_TYPECHECK(t) was introduced.
I believe that the error is due to :
  sizeof(t[1])
trying to do :
   sizeof(size_t[1])
Not sure though.
I guess the debian glibc should not use 2.6.0-test headers in its
unstable glibc, which will run on systems with 2.4.x kernels anyway.
