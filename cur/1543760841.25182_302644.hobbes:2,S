I just send it to you as an attachment in private email. I'd rather not 
resend that big a file to the lists if not needed. 
I've also put the patches online here :  
http://www.linuxtux.org/~juhl/fs_cifs_file-whitespace-cleanups-part-1.patch
http://www.linuxtux.org/~juhl/fs_cifs_file-whitespace-cleanups-part-2-and_cifs_open-rework.patch
They won't live forever at that location, but I can leave them there for a 
few weeks at least.
