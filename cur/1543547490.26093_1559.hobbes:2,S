the basic fragment type introduced by the TUX changes is a 'struct
skb_frag', which has csum, size, *page, page_offset, frag_done, *data and
*private fields - this is more than normal kiovecs offer. But i think
kiovecs can be extended to do all this (if Stephen & everybody else
agrees), i just didnt want to touch it for the time being.
