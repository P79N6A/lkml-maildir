Hi,
A tarball for testing the memory controller of CKRM (Class-based Kernel Resource
Management) is now available at
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/ckrm/ckrm-A01.tar.gz?download
It contains all the CKRM components needed to regulate the memory consumption of
a simple microbenchmar (the same one that was presented at OLS'03).
All instructions for testing are included in the README file in the download.
Feedback appreciated.
