this is the v5 release of the syslet/threadlet subsystem:
   
http://redhat.com/~mingo/syslet-patches/
this release took 4 days to get out, but there were a couple of key 
changes that needed some time to settle down:
 - ported the code from v2.6.20 to current -git (v2.6.20-rc2 should be 
   fine as a base)
 - 64-bit support in terms of a x86_64 port. Jens has updated the FIO
   syslet code to work on 64-bit too. (kernel/async.c was pretty 64-bit
   clean already, it needed minimal changes for basic x86_64 support.)
 - 32-bit user-space on 64-bit kernel compat support. 32-bit syslet and
   threadlet binaries work fine on 64-bit kernels.
 - various cleanups and simplifications
the v4->v5 delta is:
 17 files changed, 327 insertions(+), 271 deletions(-)
amongst the plans for v6 are cleanups/simplifications to the syslet 
engine API, a number of suggestions have been made for that already.
the linecount increase in v5 is mostly due to the x86_64 port. The ABI 
had to change again - see the async-test userspace code for details.
the x86_64 patch is a bit monolithic at the moment, i'll split it up 
further in v6.
As always, comments, suggestions, reports are welcome!
