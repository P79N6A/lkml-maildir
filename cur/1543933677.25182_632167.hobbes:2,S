The random lifetimes of user-visible files you create in sysfs.

At which point are you going to do that?  AFAICS, the fundamental problem
is that you
	* have aliases indistinguishable, so kmem_cache_destroy() can't tell
which one is going away, no matter what
	* have per-alias objects in sysfs
As the result, you have a user-visible mess in that directory in sysfs.
And I don't see how you would deal with that - on the "the contents of
directory changes in so-and-so way when such-and-such operation is
done", not the implementation details one.
BTW, I'm rather sceptical about free use of slabs; keep in mind that their
names have to be unique with your sysfs layout, so...
