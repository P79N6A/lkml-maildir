(Kernel version is 2.4.19-pre8.  Let me know if you want more info :)
(Motherboard is Nexcom Peak 632 : 440BX with Adaptec 7890U2)
I'm getting (over and over and over and over) the message from line
1854 of drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aic7xxx_pci.c :
scsi0: PCI error Interrupt at seqaddr = 0x8
scsi0: PCI error Interrupt at seqaddr = 0x9
(0x9 is more common, no pattern detected between 0x8 and 0x9)
It's interlaced with :
scsi0: Received a Target Abort
which means the status1 flag RTA was set, but I'm now officially out
of my league :)
This box was going fine till this morning (we upgraded from 2.4.18
last night) and a second box we did the same thing to also had the
same problem, so it looks like a kernel issue somehow, not just
faulty hardware.  Retrograding to 2.4.18 caused the problem to go
away.
Has anyone else seen this?
(or if you have suggestions, please let me know!)
