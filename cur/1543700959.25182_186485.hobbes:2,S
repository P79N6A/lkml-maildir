Mousedev PS/2 emulation for touchpads in absolute mode does not support
taps. You will either have to use Peter Osterlund's XFree86 driver at:
http://w1.894.telia.com/~u89404340/touchpad/index.html
and an updated version of GPM at 
http://www.geocities.com/dt_or/gpm
or disable native Synaptics support using psmouse_proto option
(bare, imps or exps; any of them should do the trick).
