While thes dma mapping changes look good they really don't belong into a
patch for a new driver. Can you split them out into a separate patch?

Hmm, different names for devfs vs non-devfs seems silly.  But I think we
can't easily get rid of the disc<foo>/part sillyness.  Can you at least
make both use the same prefix?

What happened to this driver, btw?

So vio on iseries claims to be pci?  That's a little silly if you ask
me..

please put all asm/* headers after linux/*

probably not needed anymore without ide emulation.

you don't use this anymore, do you?

the code surrounding this doesn't look right yet.  You first initialize
it to the maximum value and then reset it in a magic even handler?
I think that logic needs some clarification.

Aniother idea:  It might be better to just put a disk_no member into
struct viodasd_device - then you can allocate the struct viodasd_device
dynamically one by one and easily support lots of disks without overhead
for lowend configurations (remember we have a 32bit dev_t now)

shouldn't this be in some header?

What's preventing this one to be implemented above it's usage? or even
better merging it into it's only caller.

indentation looks messed up here.

as there's only one caller it shouldn't happen, should it?

no need to cast to void * here - this is implicit in C

How can d->disk ever be NULLL here?

the queue cleanups needs to be after put_gendisk.  Also where did you
see d->disk->queue as NULL?
