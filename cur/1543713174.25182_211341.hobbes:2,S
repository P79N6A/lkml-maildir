Since you have to write the sectors in order (well, you don't have
to, but the drives all do this), you lose a rev between each write
when you don't queue commands or have write cacheing.

Correct.  I have proven this to my satisfaction.
Regarding request sizes, the main benefit to very large (> 1MB)
request sizes to disk drives is elimination of the lost revolution
when write cacheing is disabled and you can't queue back-to-
back writes.
For hardware RAID, they frequently need 4MB or more to hit
peak performance.
I agree that we don't want a host driver to arbitrarily limit
I/O size, because it's difficult to predict what may be connected
to it.  It may be necessary due to deficiencies elsewhere, but
not desired.
