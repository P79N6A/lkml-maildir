An additional benefit if that you can easily run out of mtrrs.  My home 
machine boots with all 8 mtrrs used, leaving none for the G965 
graphics.  I have to compress two mtrrs into one in order to get decent 
performance.

pse pages place the pat bit in bit 12, you will need to account for that.

Do not meddle in the internals of kernels, for they are subtle and quick to panic.
