Sure but Xen already has the infrastructure for all of this and last
time I checked it was approaching and exceeding the size of the main
core kernel so a bit more of instruction emulation probably wouldn't 
do too much harm. 
In general I think any x86 hypervisor that attempts to work 
on current platforms needs instruction emulation because it is 
the only way to virtualize IO devices.
If this was supposed to be a interface for lots of hypervisors then maybe,
but so far it seems to only cover Xen and possibly some other bloatware 
ones.
That said I don't feel very strongly about emulating these instructions
or not as long as they can do that without too much code duplication.
The current patch are still a bit too excessive on the duplication front.
