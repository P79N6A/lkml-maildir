Subject: Disabling compiled-in modules at kernel boot cmdline?

Case: I'm using PowerBook with stock PLD Linux PPC kernel, it has i8042 and 
8250 modules built-in. But, those have no use on this machine (as those are 
for IBM RS/6000), and actually are really messing stuff (e.g. i8042 gives a 
lot of debug info to kernel log (that it cannot find a device blah blah), 
with 8250 I cannot use pmac_zilog driver (there is a conflict somewhere)).
Quick look at the code told me that currently there is no possibility to 
disable compiled-in kernel modules at boottime. Would it be hard to do? For 
example I give module_i8042=off (or sth. ) and initcall for i8042 is not 
called. That would be probably enough.
Yes, I know that the solution is compiling kernel myself, but doing it every 
week (for testing purposes) for about 2-3 hour could be annoying...
