Heh.  So the correct answer is:
	- don't do that.  Talking to the same device through usbfs at
	  the same time by multiple programs is cause for lots of bad
	  things to happen to your device, and might possibly cause it
	  to hang.  If you want to allow a user to access a device
	  through usbfs, make sure you trust them.
Better?  :)
