instead of dropping the dentry for a directory after an rmdir you could
left it there as a negative entry, it would avoid you to ->lookup if
somebody creat() using the name of such ex-directory.

I don't see it, at the last iput of an inode with i_nlink == 0 the inode
is freed immediatly, not like the dcache that is left floating around as
