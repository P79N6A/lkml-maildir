This patch fixes two things:
  - Correct the minor numbers for the frame buffer devices.  We have room for
    32 frame buffers since about one year, with more room for future expansion
    to 256.  (promised to go in by HPA on Fri, 24 Mar 2000 01:47:05 -0800).
  - Fix a typo in the minors for the A2232 serial card

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
