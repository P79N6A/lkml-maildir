That is "uuencoding" which was THE standard for sending binary
files via email not too long ago.  Around 1995, MIME encoding
(base64) started to become the new defacto standard.  You can cut
the file out, paste it into a text file, and then run:
uuencode < filename.uue
on it..  Or you can just tell the person to use something more
sensible next time.  ;o)
