Subject: neighbour table overflow and kernel 2.2.12?

Greetings.  I have a Linux box acting as a 3-legged router, running RedHat
6.0 with kernel 2.2.12
The kernel logger is spewing out messages about "Neighbour table overflow"
to the tune of several thousand per minute.  I traced this message down to
the route.c source in the 2.2.12 kernel, but don't know how to further
isolate the problem.   The machine has hung on two occasions in the last
week, with no panic information or strange messages other than the above
message being suppressed hundreds of times.
Routing works fine empirically, no packet loss or dropped connections.
Routing is all static at the moment, no discovery protocols involved.
Routing table is currently small, consisting of only about 12 entries.
Configured interfaces are lo,eth0,eth1,eth2.   I can attach my ifconfigs and
router table if requested.
Some kernel options I'm using:
advanced router=yes
large routing tables = yes
verbose router messages=tried both, no difference
optimize as router = yes
all firewalling options = no
IPv6 = no (IPv4 is the only protocol)
SMP=yes
Hardware is Abit BP-6 motherboard, dual Celeron 400s, 128MB ram, ICP Vortex
GDT 6517 raid controller, and three 3Com 905B-TX fast ethernet cards (into
3com LinkSwitch 3300 10/100 switches).   I'm using Donald Becker's .99L
drivers for the 905 cards, compiled directly into the kernel not as a
module.   Kernel module autoloader is off, BTW.
There are numerous posting in the various newsgroups about this message
appearing, but no discernible solution.   Most of the solutions that are
proffered appear to be dial-up pump/dhcp related, which is not happening in
my case.
So, here are my questions:
Is there anything I'm doing wrong to cause this message?
Is this specific to the 2.2.12 kernel?
Is the message indicative of a real problem?
Does the message related to my box hanging?
Thanks in advance.
