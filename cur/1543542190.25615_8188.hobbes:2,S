I don't think that is a good approach from a performance point of view -
it's too similar to what we already do.
HOWEVER, I suspect that pthreads compatibility with signals may require us
to have that thread root process (even if it isn't used for anything
else), because I think that makes our signal handling be POSIX-conformant:
if I remember correctly POSIX does allow the notion of having signals
handled in a special thread that doesn't do anything else. It would still
mean that if you create 'n' pthreads threads, you actually get 'n+1'
kernel threads, but hey, one of them is going to be dormant pretty much
all the time.
