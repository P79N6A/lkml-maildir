I suddenly realised that if your system crashes or reboots in a not so clean
way, all
kinds of sensitive data may end up in the swapfile, readable for every
malicious user
with a bootdisk.
As far as I know, it is not possible for unprivilidged users to lock pages
permanently
in RAM, so another approach should be taken.
The most preferable way would be a crypted-filesystem wherein you would have
a swap-
file. All of that outside the kernel. Is it possible to swap to something
controlled
by a userprocess? Or is a specific crypted swapper more appropriate?
