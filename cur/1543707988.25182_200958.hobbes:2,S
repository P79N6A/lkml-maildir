Subject: 2.6.x support for prism2 USB wireless adapter?

I had my Linksys prism2 USB wireless adapter (WUSB11 v2.5) working 
reasonably well with kernel 2.4.23, but with kernel 2.6.3 (and udev 018) 
I get:
usb 1-1: new full speed USB device using address 5
drivers/usb/core/config.c: invalid interface number (1/1)
usb 1-1: can't read configurations, error -22
#modprobe prism2_usb     gives:
prism2usb_init: prism2_usb.o: 0.2.1-pre20 Loaded
prism2usb_init: dev_info is: prism2_usb
drivers/usb/core/usb.c: registered new driver prism2_usb
#lsusb     does not show the device at all...
Is this still 'work in progress'?
