On the topic of v4l, Ive had complete lockups on recent 2.5.x kernels
when loading a v4l application Zapping. I havent tried anyother v4l
applications just yet, have you seen this in action? should i compile
debuging support to show it? /var/log/messages currently doesnt show it.
Running Debian Sid/Gcc 3.2.3 20030228
