Hi.
The scripts/kconfig/mconf target isn't removed by the make mrproper
target. I can see a couple of possibilities, but wasn't sure which you'd
prefer, so thought I'd just raise the issue.
It's only an issue for me because my patch generation script relies on
make mrproper making a properly clean tree.
Regards,
Nigel
