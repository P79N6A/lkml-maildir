(This is pretty old, and this is an area which changes quite a lot.  You 
should refer to something more recent;
http://www.cims.nyu.edu/cgi-systems/info2html?/usr/local/info
(gcc)Top 
for example, though in this case the quoted text looks the same.)

That not really what it means.  gcc is free to put local variables in 
memory or register, and unless you pass the local to your asm as a 
parameter, your code has no way of knowing how to find the current 
location of the local.  You could trash your stack frame from within the 
asm if you like, but I don't think gcc is under any obligation to behave 
in a deterministic way if you do.
"Unpredictable" in this case means that the memory modified isn't easily 
specified as a normal asm parameter.  For example, if you have an asm 
which does a memset(), the modified memory's size is a runtime variable 
rather than a compile-time constant.  Or perhaps your asm follows a 
linked list and modifies memory as it traverses the list.
