2.2.8 kernel gives the following error message during loading:
==
Partition check:
request_module[block-major-8]: Root fs not mounted
VFS: Cannot open root device 08:03
Kernel panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on 08:03

on my computer. It is Dual Pentium II with 1GB RAM. At that 2.2.0 kernel
works correctly.
Please let me know what should I do to fix this. Or there is a bug of the
kernel?
Thank you in advance,
