That is easy to say when you are using the command line...  Modern
distros (as you know I am sure) mount all hot-plug devices like usb
keys, usb hard disks, etc automatically at plug-in time and at least
some distros use "-o sync" for everything so you don't get (too much)
data loss when the user unplugs a device and so a umount to unplug the
device does not take ages...
Being someone who maintains a distribution based on one of the big
distributions I can tell you that figuring out how to change that
default behaviour is not always pretty.  Usually involves hacking files
deep in the bowels of the hotplug framework on the system.
Best regards,
