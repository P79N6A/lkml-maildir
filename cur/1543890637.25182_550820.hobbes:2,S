That looks like standard lisp style indenting (yes I realise that C != 
lisp).  At a guess I would say that code was written in emacs (which can 
be fixed by the necessary changes in your ~/.emacs). Grand parent post 
should check out these resources, they may help...

or if you are really gung ho the CC-mode documentation
