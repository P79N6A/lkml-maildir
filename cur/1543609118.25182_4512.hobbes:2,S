With our boards I had to track the issue that the chipset only delivered 
wake events in certain sleep modes.  It could be that linux shutdown puts
the system in a sleep mode that does not accept wake-events, but the
power-button override puts it in a wake-able sleep.  (S5 vs S3/4 ?).  Our
solution is to enable wake events in S3/4/5 on the chipset.
It could be not a net driver issue but an ACPI issue.
