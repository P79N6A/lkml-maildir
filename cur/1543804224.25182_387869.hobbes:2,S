Ok, that's fair enough.  But if you want to do something like ptys, then
why not just have your own filesystem for this driver?

I really don't know your application enough to be sure.  If you want to
use netlink, that's fine too.

Well, for 99% of the drivers, there is no problem, as there is already a
specified and documented way to interact (like network, tty, block,
etc.)  You are just making your own type of special interface up as you
go, so the complexity is also there (this complexity would normally be
in some core code, which I am hoping that your code will turn into for
other devices of the same type, right?)
