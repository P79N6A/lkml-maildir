At some point we burned a bit of effort to ensure we wiped all the ptes
and all the faulting looped until we finished when we vmtruncate();
not handling is a loophole in that, and if anything assumes it won't
find vmtruncate()'s orphans in-kernel, it will break. Apart from that
it's not so large an issue. I'm not so much attached to coddling
userspace (remap_file_pages() users should not be naive) as to shoring
up invalidate_mmap_range() with its intent (unmapping file offset ranges
instead of virtualspace ranges). Someone else might scream later.
Also, tlb_remove_tlb_entry()'s ordering with ptep_get_and_clear() seems
to be handled on ppc* by not having ptep_get_and_clear() fully clear the
pte, which is disturbing, but a sign ppc* maintainers already handle it.
