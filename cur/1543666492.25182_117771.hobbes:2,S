One open problem with my patch is that the f_pos values that are 
generated by my patch are not monotonic anymore:
f_pos    name
257    self
304    47
262    5
309    52
301    44
etc.
telldir() and seekdir() work correctly, unless anyone assumes that the 
return values are monotonically increasing.
