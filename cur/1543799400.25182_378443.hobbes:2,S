Can you now simply remove the meddling with the atomic.h headers?
i386 can directly implement arch_mutex_fast_lock instead of
atomic_dec_call_if_negative.
Not sure what the policy is with naming, but I prefer mutex_arch_xxx
or __mutex_xxx for the arch specific names.
I think ARMv6 has a decent atomic_cmpxchg implementation but does
not define __HAVE_ARCH_CMPXCHG. It might be useful to try to use this
for ARMv6 SMP for a slightly better trylock.
