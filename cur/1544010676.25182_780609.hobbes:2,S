Yes, but this doesn't matter,

Yes, but we need this only when type == PIDTYPE_PID, so the code
is correct.

Yes.
Don't get me wrong, I do agree (let me repeat again) this check is
absolutely ugly and may cause the problems.
As I said, it fixes the minor and only theoretical problem. Perhaps we
can move this check to the code  which does do_each_pid_task(PIDTYPE_PID).
Or better yet, just introduce for_each_pid_task() (see another email).

Great, thanks ;)
