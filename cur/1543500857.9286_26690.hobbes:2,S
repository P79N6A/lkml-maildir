4 * 100Mbit Ethernet costs 4 PCI slots unless you get a quad card and
then the price suddenly goes way up and part of the redundancy idea
goes away. And you waste most if not all of your PCI slots which would
have been nice for a couple of SCSI controllers.
The sale of Gigabit Ethernet is going through the roof, lotsa people
buy it, though I suspect most of them don't have the slightest clue
why they buy it.

A Gigabit Ethernet car costs less than $300 these days, I doubt you
can get a quad Ethernet card for that price. Besides you want a switch
if you want to gain anything from having four cards running, plugging
four cards into the same machine and then into a hub is gonna give you
exactly the same bandwidth as _one_ 100Mbit card.
I haven't checked the prices recently, but I also suspect that one
Gigabit port in a switch is cheaper or at least close to the price of
4 100Mbit ports.

Thats exactly what we are.
