Hum ?
The driver have to return an error (negative value) in the probbing 
function if it detect that the card fails to respond correctly.
Same happen for i2c.
If the driver didn't manage to find what it expect on the i2c bus, the 
driver won't be usefull for the device, so the driver should release the 
device.
