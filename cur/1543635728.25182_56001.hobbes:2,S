Neat idea.  I have seen some other good similar ideas: check
preempt_count on schedule(), check preempt_count in usleep/msleep
(Arjan's idea), and check preempt_count in wakeup/context switch/etc.
code...
Note some of these need one or both of: subtracting out
current->lock_depth+1 since we can sleep with the BKL and NAND'ing out
PREEMPT_ACTIVE as that is set before entering schedule off a preemption.
As we move preempt_count to more of a generic "are we atomic" count in
2.5, these become easier and more useful...
