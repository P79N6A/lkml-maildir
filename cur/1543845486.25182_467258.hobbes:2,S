... yes, I'd assume it's a hardware issue too.  Try different
cables; if you have a fast 'scope, you might see what kind of
eye diagram you get.  The hub might improve the signal quality.
Do you know how the remote wakeup mechanism works for this chip?
It'd be interesting to see "usbnet" be taught how to autosuspend
chips which will wake up the USB host when they get the right
kind of packet ... for example, passing the multicast/broadcast
filter, or addressed directly to that adapter.
Such an autosuspend mechanism would let the host controller stop
polling a mostly-idle network link, getting rid of one source of
periodic DMA transfers and thus allowing deeper sleep states for
many x86 family CPUs.  And also, I'd expect, giving fewer
opportunities for those broken RX packets.  :)
