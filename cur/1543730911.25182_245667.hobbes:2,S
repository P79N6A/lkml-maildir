Point is: you're killing the method for detecting when IRQ handlers
return bogus return codes since you only look at them when they
respond with IRQ_HANDLED.
So, you're disabling the "bogus return value" check.  Completely.
The whole point of the check is to identify bad IRQ handlers so they
can be fixed up.
