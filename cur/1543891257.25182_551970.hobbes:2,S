I was wrong. The problem is that input works, output works, but 
copying-and-pasting with gpm doesn't work (the stable version of the CD, 
http://ums.usu.ru/~patrakov/x86/lfslivecd-x86-6.2-5.iso,
 contains a 
rejected-upstream kernel patch that hides the issue). This means that for 
all serious Unicode work, you must use X.
