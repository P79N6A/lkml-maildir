Subject: Announce loop-AES-v3.0a file/swap crypto package
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

loop-AES changes since previous release:
- Added new improved version 3 on-disk format that includes one separate key
  for MD5 IV computation. This fixes a weakness in IV computation that
  normally is not exploitable.
- Fixed a bug that caused key file decrypt failure when gpg home directory
  was on read-only mounted file system. This bug affected encrypted root
  partition usage and is present only in losetup+mount from loop-AES-v2.2c
  and loop-AES-v2.2d versions.
