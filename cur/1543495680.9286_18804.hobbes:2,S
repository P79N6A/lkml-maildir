Hi,
Now that everyone is focussing on wish lists again,
it might be nice to point out that the linux-kernel
list is for _development_ and _bugfixes_.
If you want to participate in making a nice wish
list with 'wanted' features for 2.3/2.4, you should
move to the linux-future@nl.linux.org mailing list,
which was created specifically for the purpose of
keeping linux-kernel clean and giving the 'wish-list'
folks a place to chat as much as they want.
