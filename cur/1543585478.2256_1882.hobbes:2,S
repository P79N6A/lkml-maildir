Is there ever a case where killing init is the right thing to do?
My impression is that if init is selected the whole machine dies.
If you can kill init and still have a machine that mostly works,
then I guess it makes some sense not to kill it.
Guaranteeing not to select init can buy you piece of mind because
init if properly setup can put the machine back together again, while
not special casing init means something weird might happen and init
would be selected.
