This still looks very much like a server issue to me. Could someone who
is seeing the bug try to capture an instance of the ESTALE error going
across the wire, and then do a fresh lookup of the same file from an
"ls" call. I'd like to check how the stale filehandle differs from the
freshly looked up one...
Please use "tcpdump -s 9000 -w /tmp/binary.pcap port 2049 and host
my.servers.name" for the actual capture.
Cheers,
  Trond
