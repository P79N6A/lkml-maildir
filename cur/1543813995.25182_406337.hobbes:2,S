Yup, getting rid of the need for all these confusing locking
modes was one of the objectives in mind for DIO simplification.

)
Once we have an efficient range locking or similar mechanism in place
(Chris Mason is working on a patch), then it should be possible to push
out all of the i_mutex locking to higher level routines, outside of
direct-io.c.
Longer term, it would be nice to be able to rethink and further simplify
the whole _nolock equiv versions for VFS write methods. Especially the
percolation down to sync_page_range_nolock, etc.
