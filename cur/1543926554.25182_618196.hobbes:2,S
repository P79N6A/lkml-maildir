I'm not familiar with the KFT but I'm sure it would be easy to port
latency_trace to it. Really, all the mcount does is make a wrapper to pass
to the trace calls.
Here's the code for mcount in arch/x86/kernel/entry_64.S:
ENTRY(mcount)
	cmpl $0, mcount_enabled
	jz out
	push %rbp
	mov %rsp,%rbp
	push %r11
	push %r10
	push %r9
	push %r8
	push %rdi
	push %rsi
	push %rdx
	push %rcx
	push %rax
	mov 0x0(%rbp),%rax
	mov 0x8(%rbp),%rdi
	mov 0x8(%rax),%rsi
	call   __trace
	pop %rax
	pop %rcx
	pop %rdx
	pop %rsi
	pop %rdi
	pop %r8
	pop %r9
	pop %r10
	pop %r11
	pop %rbp
out:
	ret
Which simply passes to __trace the rip that jumped here, and (if possible)
the rip of that caller. The parent rip is not necessary.

If the KFT could do the above, it should be trivial to adapt.
Hmm, if someone is willing to send me a free mips box, I may do it myself
;-)
