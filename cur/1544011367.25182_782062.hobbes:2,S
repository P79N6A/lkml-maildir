Hi,
This is version 4 of dmaengine and framebuffer drivers for i.MX31.
Changes since version 3: fixed idmac_issue_pending() to not reset the 
current buffer, fixed return value from idmac_tx_submit(), fixed 
framebuffer panning.
Changes since version 2: now uses a tasklet to clean up completed 
transaction descriptors, as suggested by Dan Williams.
Changes since version 1: rebased on the updated dmaengine framework.
I'd really like to get this in for 2.6.29, so, please, review and comment.
Based on linux-next as of commit f0e0e8954d03b414927650a6129ace01d554afdc.
Thanks
Guennadi
