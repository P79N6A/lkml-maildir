I have a question/suggestion. I'm working with real-time audio processing,
and I'm using linux, but because of the internal structure (real
multitasking), this OS is not really well suited for such applications
since a guaranteed CPU time and/or timing cannot be obtained.
Now and in the future more and more applications (esp. multimedia) require
excact timing and CPU time (like MPEG and other real-time activities).
Is there or will there be any methods in the kernel to be able to obtain
such "locked" processes? In my application the audio processing process
_must_ get the required CPU time. I don't care if other processes must
wait as a consequence of this process. (BTW: There's a pratical limit for
how much nice is able to "fix" the problem.)
IMMHO if there is no methodes in the kernel to do such things, this might
be an idea to implement.
