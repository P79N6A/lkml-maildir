Strange or not, correct or not - depends on the point of view.
The key word here is "udev" - check your udev rules.  Since some time
ago udev on some distros comes with rules to give persistent device
names for network interfaces.  Some time ago you had eth0 and eth1
with different hardware, and udev remembered this fact somewhere.
Now it sees new hardware, and gives it consecutive numbers, renaming
kernel devices.
