Actually, *these* system calls aren't the problem, as most of them take file
descriptors, which are capabilities.
The question comes down to: do you want to facilitate secure collaboration, or
do you want to run POSIX apps.  Pick one, because you cannot do both.

It's surprising how well a compatibility box works.  The truth is that most of
your day to day environment can stay in POSIX without much of a problem.
Especially when your compatibility box is about the same speed as the real POSIX
system.
