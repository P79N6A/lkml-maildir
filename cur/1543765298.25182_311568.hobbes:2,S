If there are checks, they should be there for a purpose, and any sane
reader will asume these checks to be nescensary. If they are dead code, you
can say that, but please don't flame Adrian for fixing obviously buggy code
in a way that is sane and at least more correct than the original without
using several days of his lifetime to analyze the whole driver. Instead, you
could provide the correct fix.
