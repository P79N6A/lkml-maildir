I considered that option but decided it was easier to sort the tables
at boot time.
Which tables to sort, where they are, the size of each entry, the size
and offset of the key in each table are all arch specific.  The top
level makefile would have to make tmp_vmlinux then ask each arch
Makefile to do whatever it needed to convert tmp_vmlinux to vmlinux,
using a target specific program.
IA64 used to sort its unwind table at boot (ld was buggy at the time)
and the overhead was not noticable.  PPC already sorts at boot time, I
doubt that they notice it.  Either option would work but IMHO sorting
at boot time is easier to code and maintain.
