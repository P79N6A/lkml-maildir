I just want to remind that no one has been able to offer a good way of 
handling attributes/streams/metafiles other than reiser4 in which 
CTRL-XCTRL-Ffilename within emacs to edit the stream/attribute/metafile 
will work without modifying the emacs source.  David Masover is right 
that there are far more application writers than kernel hackers, and we 
should make the kernel more complicated if it makes a few thousand apps 
simpler.
