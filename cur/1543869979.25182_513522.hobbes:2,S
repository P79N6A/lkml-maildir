In all the books where I studied, the algorithms below would be classified 
as O(num_ready) ones:
[sys_kevent_wait]
+	for (i=0; i<num; ++i) {
+		k = kevent_dequeue_ready_ring(u);
+		if (!k)
+			break;
+		kevent_complete_ready(k);
+
+		if (k->event.ret_flags & KEVENT_RET_COPY_FAILED)
+			break;
+		kevent_stat_ring(u);
+		copied++;
+	}
[kevent_user_wait]
+	while (num < max_nr && ((k = kevent_dequeue_ready(u)) != NULL)) {
+		if (copy_to_user(buf + num*sizeof(struct ukevent),
+					&k->event, sizeof(struct ukevent))) {
+			if (num == 0)
+				num = -EFAULT;
+			break;
+		}
+		kevent_complete_ready(k);
+		++num;
+		kevent_stat_wait(u);
+	}
It does not matter if inside the loop you invert a 20Kx20K matrix or you 
copy a byte, they both are O(num_ready).
