  Hello.
  So I've looked to quota code and I found one problem with statistics counting
(I already sent patch to Linus). The other problem might be (at least in my case
was) that quota utilities were compiled against old (2.0) kernel. And structure
for statistics reporting changed so quotastats showed bogus values....
