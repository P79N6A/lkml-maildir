One (mostly psychological, but still serious) problem is that stack
dumps make panics always look like kernel bugs.  But there are panics
which are definitely not kernel bugs: like the popular cannot mount
root or machine checks or a couple of others.
We do not want users to send all these panics to linux-kernel
and they would if they look too much like kernel bugs.
I think it's in principle a good idea, but only if you
distingush the cases which are not kernel bugs.
e.g. use a different panic() call for them that does not dump.
