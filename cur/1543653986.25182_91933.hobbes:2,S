Even for module profiling, we need section data available.
Although all module code currently goes in a single text area, there is
no guarantee that will always be the case.  In the past we have had
multiple text areas in modules (out of line lock code used its own
section for a long time) and future changes could require multiple text
sections.  To do profiling correctly, you need to know where all the
text sections are, i.e. the module loader has to publish symbols and
section data.  Loosing that data is a big step backwards.
