  I find the logic of these "test - please disregard" emails weird..
  You definitely want list-owners attention, perhaps Postmasters...
  If somebody doesn't receive email from vger's  linux-kernel  for
  few HOURS, there is either something wrong in the systems(*), or
  the recipient has been removed for some reason.
  *) "systems" include vger itself (it has died this week alone 4-5 times),
     network connectivity from vger to you, and your local email systems.
  If   
http://vger.kernel.org/
   answers, vger *is* operational, and
  its email system should be operational too -- or then myself or DaveM
  are just doing something to it.
  The case at hand:
  A burst of rejections from your service ISP:
May  7 18:42:54 vger smtp[2973]: S136669AbREGV1F:
	to=<balbert@internet.com>, delay=01:15:49, xdelay=00:10:03, mailer=smtp,
	relay=natasha.iworld.com ([63.95.15.6|25|199.183.24.194|4643]),
	stat=error2 550 5.1.1 <balbert@internet.com>... User unknown
May  7 18:45:22 vger smtp[2973]: S136668AbREGU70:
	to=<balbert@internet.com>, delay=01:45:56, xdelay=00:02:28, mailer=smtp,
	relay=natasha.iworld.com ([63.95.15.6|25|199.183.24.194|4643]),
	stat=deferred remote hung up on us while 1 responses missing
  I could bet that the beast did run out of some critical resources, and
  it shows the result like this.   It *really* sucks...
  Of course the  linux-kernel-owner  receives *only* the "stat=error*" cases;
  you could say "distilled bad news" -- even if only one or two failure 
  cases out hundreds of successfull, we may still think that the address
  just became nonexistent...
