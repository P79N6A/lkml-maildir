The point is to get rid of 'propval', and having the core driver define
formats.  That's one of the places where we ran into problems with the
current API; by having the core driver define what type a property should
be returning, we limit battery drivers to what they can display, as well
as encourage a lot of non-shared code to end up in the core driver.  That's
the reason why we strcpy into 'buf', rather than val->strval.
For transitioning, we could certainly just use val->strval all of the time,
but there's not much point in doing that in the long term; we might as well
just pass around 'buf'.
