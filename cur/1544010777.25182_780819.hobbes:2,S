The original logic was all predicated on my thoughts on how my new
fanotify would want these events and how I felt that open for exec was
worth the separate hook.  None of that is useful at this time and in any
case IN_OPEN makes a lot more sense than IN_ACCESS.  Since you've got me
looking at these as freestanding patchs I do tend to think that the
easiest thing for now would be to just drop patch 2 and make the call
sites from patch 2 call fsnotify_open directly.
I'll resend in the morning a single patch to call directly to
fsnotify_open.  (and another single patch to immediately do the rename
that I want done which I'll send as the full normal diff since it'll be
freestanding)
