What do you mean by return? You can't pass it back as write()'s return
value. I suppose you could then arrange for the fd to be read():-/

Yes, but given that the targets of the symlinks would not be in /proc, how do
you concoct the symlink. I suppose you could assume "/sysfs/keys/<keyid>" as
the target, but that's not very nice.

It would be quite an involved process to do this in userspace. You'd have to
walk through a nest of keyrings, and you'd have to do a lot of file opening,
and closing (possibly 2 per key: type and description, though these could be
available through the same file) and reading of dirs and symlinks.
Maintaining access controls would be fun though... How does the kernel then
distinguish between a read and a search?
