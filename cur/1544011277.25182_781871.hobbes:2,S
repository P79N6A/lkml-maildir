Subject: i8k: fails to detect Dell XPS M1530, fails to get SMM BIOS version with force=1

I see two problems with the i8k module and the Dell XPS M1530. First,
the laptop is not detected. Second, even if it is detected, the module
prints that it is unable to get the SMM BIOS version even though the
module appears to be working:
# modprobe i8k force=1
# dmesg | grep i8k
[  547.007217] i8k: not running on a supported Dell system.
[  547.007234] i8k: vendor=Dell Inc., model=XPS M1530
     , version=A08
[  547.007629] i8k: unable to get SMM BIOS version
# cat /proc/i8k
1.0 A08 5D26YF1 53 0 0 0 0 -1 -22
Information from DMI:
BIOS Information
        Vendor: Dell Inc.
        Version: A08
        Release Date: 03/19/2008
System Information
        Manufacturer: Dell Inc.
        Product Name: XPS M1530
It seems straightforward to add a record for the auto-detection, but
I'm not sure how generic it should be. From looking online, it appears
the M1330, M1530, and M1730 all need to be detected. Perhaps it should
just be "Dell XPS M Series" and only match on "XPS M"? Does anyone
else on the list use these laptops?
Thanks,
