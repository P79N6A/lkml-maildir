Thanks!
Basically just see if you can produce a hang by repeatedly loading and
unloading snd-nm256, preferably at a console, so you can see any Oops.
If you do see the hang, try the reset_workaround options described in
ALSA-Configuration.txt.
If you can reproduce a hang add printks in the module __init code and
try to narrow down where it dies.
