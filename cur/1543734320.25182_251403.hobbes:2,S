Actually, it seems that the sockets that are not closing properly are
the ones opened by your proof of concept code, *NOT* the server. The
servers (mysql and Apache), close their sockets properly. I could verify
this over a network. Locally, I got
tcp        0      0 192.168.53.2:41440      192.168.53.1:3306      
TIME_WAIT
tcp        0      0 192.168.53.2:41442      192.168.53.1:3306      
TIME_WAIT
tcp        0      0 192.168.53.2:41443      192.168.53.1:3306      
TIME_WAIT
tcp        0      0 192.168.53.2:41452      192.168.53.1:3306      
TIME_WAIT
tcp        0      0 192.168.53.2:41468      192.168.53.1:80        
TIME_WAIT
tcp        0      0 192.168.53.2:41441      192.168.53.1:80        
TIME_WAIT
tcp        0      0 192.168.53.2:41447      192.168.53.1:80        
TIME_WAIT
tcp        0      0 192.168.53.2:41444      192.168.53.1:80         TIME
etc..
But on the server, only 1 or two ESTABISHED entries, nothing more.
I don't see much of a DOS, except maybe to DOS a localhost. And you can
do that already.
