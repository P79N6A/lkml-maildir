Hmm. Trying to explain aesthetic judgments is always fun, but I'll try.
String parsing bloats the kernel with code that will be called rarely, 
and doing it inside the filesystem module makes for duplicate code if 
more than one filesystem does it. But a good common parser routine (or a 
kernel api that takes a pre-compiled parse tree) would reduce the bad taste.
The real objection I have is that it puts the kernel in the position of 
doing more work than it has to for the system to operate correctly and 
efficiently. The user wants to know what files match a certain set of 
criteria. The filesystem provides special features which can greatly 
accelerate some searches. Does it make more sense to move the 
functionality of /usr/bin/find into the kernel, or to export the index 
information so that an enhanced version of find can make use of it?
I don't think having find in the kernel would be worth the cost or 
complexity.
However, now that I've had to think about it while writing the above, it 
occurs to me that if we wanted to offer something like the beos's live 
queries, doing it in the kernel might be the way to go.
For the 99.9% of people who were not beos users back in the day, the 
"live query" was a way to register a query string with the kernel, so 
that you got notifications when the list of files matching the query 
changed. It was pretty cool, but this is really just blue-skying since I 
am not stepping up to write such a beast any time soon.

Why not? And if it really splits the filesystem into two parts depends 
on which of the two following statements you agree with more:
"Fast searching is a feature of the filesystem"
"Maintaining indexes is a feature of the filesystem"
PS.
The file-as-directory attribute/stream/whatever model is a much better 
fit for befs's internals than the xattr api. If the kernel supported it, 
I would enable support for it in befs.
