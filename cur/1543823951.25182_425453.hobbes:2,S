Hi, Martin/Andrew,
I am resending this email, my mailer got crazy and sent out HTML (sorry!)
I have seen the patches around, but I've had no time to review them. I
was planning to do so this weekend.
The main difference I see, like you pointed out is the netlink
interface vs debugfs. I think the netlink approach is more suitable
(there is no need to mount a filesystem and create files followed by
frequent open/read/close operations). Just one netlink socket should
do the trick. The event subscription mechanism in netlink is very
useful as well.
Martin, could you please take a look at the taskstats interface and
see if it is possible to make use of them?
Thanks,
Balbir
