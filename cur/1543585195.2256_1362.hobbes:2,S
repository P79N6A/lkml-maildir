I wondered about getting kapm-idled to take the CPU time allocated to
itself, and reallocate to the idle task.  Something like the following
at a strategic point inside the apm loop.
    unsigned long user, system;
    user = current->times.tms_utime;
    system = current->times.tms_stime;
    current->times.tms_utime = current->times.tms_stime = 0;
    idle->times.tms_utime += user;
    idle->times.tms_stime += system;
I haven't looked to see what point would be a good idea, and investigated
what locks need to be held.  I've also just peeked at the 2.4 code,
and seen "current->per_cpu_utime[cpu]" -- does this need handling?
Is it visible to user space?
If you looked closely, you might see the CPU time falling for kapm-idled,
but generally you would see it allocated to the idle task, and not
kapm-idled.

At least with this scheme, the special casing is inside the kapm specific
code, and not within the general timer handling.
Of course, this is no more than an idea.  I haven't got as far as
running 2.4 on my only APM machine (486 Thinkpad), let alone trying out
this scheme.
