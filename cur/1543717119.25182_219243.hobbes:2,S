I'm not trying to base everything on ACPI, this happens in the first
patces though.  I would separate them in the future release.
(Actually I put comments about it in the first patch:)
There will be the dependent and independent codes.  Any platform
can share the independent code, and dependent code needs to
be made by each platform.  I think that PCI hotplug takes the same
way.
Thanks,
Kei
