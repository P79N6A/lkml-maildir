Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This is take 2 of the previous mail with David's comments in mind.
Hello Andrew,
we have announced UBI several months ago in the MTD mailing list. It was
successfully used in our setup and we've got positive feedback.
In short, it is kind of LVM layer but for flash (MTD) devices which
hides flash devices complexities like bad eraseblocks (on NANDs) and
wear. The documentation is available at the MTD web site:
http://www.linux-mtd.infradead.org/doc/ubi.html
http://www.linux-mtd.infradead.org/faq/ubi.html
The source code is available at the UBI GIT tree:
git://git.infradead.org/ubi-2.6.git
The UBI GIT tree is based upon the mtd-2.6.git
(git://git.infradead.org/mtd-2.6.git)
There is also an 'mtd' branch available in the UBI GIT which contains
the current mtd-2.6.git. So that you can use git-diff mtd and have UBI
patches.
There is also web interface to the git trees available:
UBI: 
http://git.infradead.org/?p=ubi-2.6.git;a=summary
MTD: 
http://git.infradead.org/?p=mtd-2.6.git;a=summary
Plain patches may be found at
http://linux-mtd.infradead.org/~dedekind/ubi/
Please, include the patches to your tree.
