Subject: [PATCH 2.6.25-rc2 6/9] Kconfig: Improve init/Kconfig help descriptions - CGROUPS
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/21/474

Rewrite the help descriptions for clarity, accuracy and consistency.
Kernel config options affected:
  - CGROUPS
  - CGROUP_DEBUG
  - CPUSETS
  - GROUP_SCHED
  - CGROUP_SCHED
  - CGROUP_CPUACCT
  - SYSFS_DEPRECATED
  - CGROUP_MEM_CONT
  - PROC_PID_CPUSET
