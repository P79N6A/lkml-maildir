I think that is one possible mechanism, yes.  What we need is for the VM
system to "act more intelligently".  I've given up on trying to get VM
info and throttling the nbd device using it, because the lockup doesn't
involve nbd, and would be made worse by slowing it down.  The lockup is
purely a VM phenonemen - It tries to flush buffers aimed at nbd.  but
won't give the nbd process any tcp buffers to do the flushing with, and
thus blocks itself.

This is part of the standard setup in Enbd, at least - the client
daemons twiddle these settings to at least 15/85% on startup.  It
doesn't help the reported tcp/vm deadlock, though it makes the occasions
on which it happens more "abnormal" than "usual".  Unfortunately those
abnormal conditions are reached under memory pressure while nbd is
running - one simply has to get tcp competing for buffers with other
heavy i/o.  If the i/o is directed at nbd itself, you have a deadlock.
Setting PF_MEMALLOC on the networking process seems to help a lot.
Obviously it can't help if we are competing against "nothing" instead of
another process.  I.e.  when we are doing i/o exclusively to nbd.  (e.g.
swap over nbd).

I'm willing to look, but you don't make it sound intrinsically
likely.
And setting vm/bdflush affects everthing, and presumably unoptimizes
the settings for everthing else on the system. This is core
kernel hackers territory .. somebody must be able to do something
here!
