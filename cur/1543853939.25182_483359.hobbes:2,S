How about documenting  things you've told me back  in September?  I.e.
i386/amd64 have motorola RTC (and  clones) based system clock setup in
boot  sequence "arch/x86_64/kernel/time.c".  Also,  how it  interferes
with time_hpet.c? There seem to  be confusion what RTC timer and
RTC clock is: <

Also  util-linux  package  maintaining  was  under  question  in  lkml
recently.  I  think, i should update  rc script i  rewrote for hwclock
with  more info.  I agree  with you,  that on  PC hwclock  is useless,
unless dual-boot users are not in consern.
I'll try to review and test patches. I wonder, why they were not posted
before, but just before 2.6.19?
Thanks!
