Are you talking of inbound, or outbound connections?
Inbound-connections are mostly limited by the available filehandles and by
how much server-processes your box can handle.
Outbound-connections are limited by the local portrange, changeable
in /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range
(ran into this on one of my proxy servers, having thousands of connections
in the state CLOSING, TIME_WAIT and LAST_ACK - after
echo "1024 16383" >/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range the box at
least stays working)
