Indeed, I've tried Aurelien's patch and it works fine for me (on an asus
k8s-mx motherboard). Going back over the reasons for the patch that is
in -mm that I submitted, which was a rework of
a patch that Arnaud Patard/Uwe Koziolek sent to linux-ide, it seems that the
thinking was that complex probing and/or configuration was required for
this chipset. I don't have any specs to work from, and am not the expert
in any case, but it would seem that this is not necessary, and
just doing a standard detect of the southbridge id is fine.
Unless anyone has stronger evidence/experience, it would seem that the
simplest/cleanest solution is an update to SiSHostChipInfo[], as in Aurelien's
patch.
