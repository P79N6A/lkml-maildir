Hello,
	I have a problem with multiple machines that I have that have
dual onboard nic's on them that come up as "3Com Corporation 3c982 Dual
Port Server Cyclone" nics. The carrier counter seems to increase quite
quickly at about  1354 carriers per 3030906 bytes. I was transferring a
13 gig backup when I noticed the carriers. I seem to be transferring at
a rate of 1.7 Mb/sec.  The 6506 that I am plugged into is reporting no
errors or anything wrong with the lines at all. Mii-tool reports that
it's running 100Mbit FD. 
Any help would be greatly appreciated,
	Thanks, 
		Justin Booth
