Nope, I didn't see any, and I did audit all of the places that used
i_pipe.  At least in the mainline kernel, all of the places which used
i_pipe were in places were we knew already that we were dealing with a
pipe.  
As was mentioned in earlier comment, this will be problematic for the
out-of-tree System V Streams code, which hijacks i_pipe as another
place to store 4 bytes of random data needed for the Streams code (I
believe they needed a pointer to the stream head -- the v_str pointer
in a legacy Unix system's inode).  But, that is an out-of-tree kernel
module, and it's a clear abuse of the i_pipe element in any case.
