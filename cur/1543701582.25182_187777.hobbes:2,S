ok, hdparm updated to v5.4
and this is the new script:
_____________________________________________________________________
#!/bin/bash
# This script assumes hdparm v5.4
NR_TESTS=3
RA_VALUES="64 128 256 8192"
killall5
sync
hdparm -a 0 /dev/hda > /dev/null
hdparm -t /dev/hda > /dev/null
for ra in $RA_VALUES; do
    hdparm -a $ra /dev/hda > /dev/null;
    echo -n $ra$'\t';
    tot=0;
    for i in `seq $NR_TESTS`; do
	tmp=`nice -n '-20' hdparm -t /dev/hda|grep 'Timing'|tr -d ' '|cut -d'=' -f2|cut -d'M' -f1`;
	tot=`echo "scale=2; $tot+$tmp" | bc`;
    done;
    s=`echo "scale=2; $tot/$NR_TESTS" | bc`;
    echo $s;
done
_____________________________________________________________________
The results are like the previous.
2.6.0:
64        31.91
128      31.89
256      26.22	# during the transfer HD LED blinks
8192    26.26	# during the transfer HD LED blinks
2.6.1-rc1:
64        25.84	# during the transfer HD LED blinks
128      25.85	# during the transfer HD LED blinks
256      25.90	# during the transfer HD LED blinks
8192    26.42	# during the transfer HD LED blinks
I have tried with and without "nice -n '-20'" but without any visible changes.
Performance with 2.4:
with kernel 2.4.23 && readahead = 8 I get 31.89 MB/s...
changing readahead doesn't seem to affect the speed too much.
