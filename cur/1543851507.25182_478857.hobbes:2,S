It appears that the driver cannot talk to your card; see the "max tries
exceeded when issueing command".  Did this card work previously with a
kernel?  Can narrow down which kernels have problems and which don't?

It's a bit hard to figure out what firmware you have because the driver
can't talk to the card; can you boot under Windows and determine that
using the Cisco wireless utility?  You also need to flash the card under
Windows, not Linux, ideally to a version of firmware greater than
5.60.08.

reloading the driver (rmmod airo; modprobe airo) should reset the card.
