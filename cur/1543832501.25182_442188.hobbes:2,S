klibc and the kernel does not share any rules today.
And yacc is so special that it's not worth it only for yacc to start
doing this.
In todays kernel build yacc is never used. For the few cases were output
of yacc is needed the kernel include _shipped files. For dash we should
maybe consider the same?
