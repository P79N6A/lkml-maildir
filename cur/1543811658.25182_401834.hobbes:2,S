Think about audio.  Single speed = 75 frames of 2352 bytes per second, 
or 176kB/s.  However with data tracks you only get 2k per frame/sector, 
so that works out to be 153kB/s.
Due to the CLV nature of CD-ROMs you may find the drive is faster 
reading some parts of the disc than others.

You can do a similar calculation with DVDs.  While I can't find a 
reference for the maximum DVD total bitrate of ~10Mbit/s, this at 1.25 
MByte/s this roughly agrees with the 1.32 quoted.
