Subject: 2.2.3ac4 and still sockets on nfs unusable

We are using knfs with 2.2.3ac4 and have severe problems using sockets
on nfs-mounted volumes. In the logs I find triples like this:
Mar 23 13:17:15 neptun kernel: nfs_free_dentries: found .X11-unix/X0, d_count=10, hashed=0
Mar 23 13:17:15 neptun kernel: __nfs_fhget: inode 917613 still busy, i_count=2
Mar 23 13:17:15 neptun kernel: __nfs_fhget: killing .X11-unix/X0 filehandle
Similar messages appear for a lot of files but it seems to hurt only for 
sockets (like /tmp/.X11-unix/X0, /dev/printer and /dev/log). After these
messages appear, the connected processes (X, lpd, syslogd) are no longer 
reachable.
I had a look at the sources at nfs/inode.c but don't know enough to
understand them. With some hints about the general flow of information
through the nfs-system (*), I would nevertheless try to find the bug.

(*) I currently don't even know if the kernel-part of nfs or if knfsd
communicates over the net.
