Yes, a form of barrier() must be present in mdelay() or udelay() itself
as you say, having it in __const_udelay() is *not* enough (superflous
actually, considering it is already a separate translation unit and
invisible to the compiler).
However, there are no compiler barriers on the macro-definition-path
between mdelay(1) and __const_udelay(), so the only thing that saves us
from being a bug here is indeed the different-translation-unit concept.
