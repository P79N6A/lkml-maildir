Because "diff -p" format used by the kernel mailing list takes
the most recent line that begins with an identifier letter and
put that on the hunk header line, even in such a case, you will
see:
	@@ -l,k +m,n @@ struct file_operations ... = {
		...
		...
	+	...
	+	.ioctl = ...
	+	...
		...
which would be a good enough cue that the new .ioctl member is
added to file_operations.
