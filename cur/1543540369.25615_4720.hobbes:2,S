I have a micron clientpro dx5000 dual 733 PIII machine with the i840 pci
chipset, outrigger motherboard (I believe) and  it has onboard sound and
ethernet.  
I have tried the lastest kernel and the machine locks up at Probing PCI
hardware.  Conf2 does not recognize a PCI bus being there at all.  I have
tried disabling the onboard sound and ethernet.  How is the support for
the i840 chipset?  I have read that others have gotten machines with other
motherboards to work but I am at a loss here.  Any Ideas?
thanks
Brian Johanson
