There are no plans for a kernel on Intel which can address more than 2GB
of system memory for the networking code.  Memory above 1G or 2G
(depending on the way the kernel has been compiled) is only usable for
process's private virtual address spaces on the current BIGMEM kernels,
and even if we extend that to allow high memory page cache access, we
won't support network control blocks or buffers in high memory.

I've had one file dup()ed a million times, and yes, we used to store
that refcount in a short.  Not any more. :)
