correct, that's where all such things (auditing, seccomp, ptrace, 
sigstop, freezing, etc.) hook into. Much (all?) of the current entry.S 
hacks can go away in favor of a much easier .c patch to 
do_syscall_trace() and this would reduce a significantion portion of the 
present intrusiveness of LTTng.
