Inside a driver (or module) file, any include reference that doesn't begin with
either <linux/foo.h> or <asm/foo.h> should always raise a red flag.  There are
user-land header files ("/usr/include") and kernel header files
("/usr/src/linux/include") and never the twain shall meet.
Mixing includes is always a bad idea.
