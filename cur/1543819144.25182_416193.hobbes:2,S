Obviously not ;-(
I do look every so often, but not frequently. I'm working on 
reformatting the site right now, which is why I was poking around.
reaim I often don't look at, as it's not as stable as I'd like, but
that is a *huge* drop.
You can see I collated stuff down into a collection of tests per
machine-release combo, so the dbench and LTP results are folded
into the main matrix now. Next stage is to add performance regression
comparions in there, but it's not easy unless we run multiple times
so that I get std dev as well as average. All of this should make it
easier to (a) see and (b) send out proactive notifications.

Sigh ... this is exactly why I want the new autotest harness, I could 
just hand you the control file and you could run the same test (at your
box or OSDL or whatever). Not finished yet though ;-(
drilling down into the results directories can get you the command line,
looks like "reaim -f workfile.short -s 1 -e 10 -i 2" to me. Buggered if
I can recall what that did though.

I *think* it's only ia32 NUMA boxes, at least as far as I can see from
a quick poke around. Which would make me guess at scheduler code. Gitweb
would be nice to use, but it doesn't tag the -git snapshots, AFAICS, 
which is a real shame. Nor does the git snapshot include the git tag,
as far as I know. Grrrr. I guess I'll download the snapshots and diff
them, and try to pull out the sched changes by hand. Much suckage.
