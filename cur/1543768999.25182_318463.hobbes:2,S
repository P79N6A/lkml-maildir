Hello,
as I reported in
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=111554477416794&w=2
I have lots of problem with aic7xxx (and till 2.6.12-rc2 everything
works perfectly). I have tried to compil 2.6.12-rc4-mm1 without probe
all Lun and it don't change anything at all to this problem.
I have two different controllers :
0000:00:05.0 SCSI storage controller: Adaptec AIC-7892A U160/m (rev 02)
0000:00:0a.0 SCSI storage controller: Adaptec AHA-2940U/UW/D / AIC-7881U
And I also use libsata.
Anyone got an idea on what's going wrong ?
