mprotect() only works on the portion that is currently allocated.
If the stack grows, then another call is needed.  Tracking the high-
water mark is an expense.  Forcing the allocation of the maximum
extent for the stack of the current thread, even to the same copy-
on-write all-zero page, can cause memory overcommit problems.
