That's definitely where it should be - the behaviour of the
PCI_INTERRUPT_LINE register is clearly chip-specific, so it should be in
the chip-specific drivers..
It's a kind of strange behaviour, though. What chip is this? It sounds
kind of convenient, but as far as I can tell it can only work for those
kinds of PCI devices that are on the same chip as the irq controller..
