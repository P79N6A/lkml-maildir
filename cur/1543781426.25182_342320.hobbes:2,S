i have released the 2.6.13-rc6-rt2 tree, which can be downloaded from 
the usual place:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/
it includes a single bugfix, which fixes a HRT timer-latency problem, 
and which could explain some of the crashes/reboots Thomas Gleixner was 
seeing on his test-box.
Changes since 2.6.13-rc6-rt1:
 - fix raise_softirq_prio() bug which can cause artificial latencies and 
   can cause runqueue corruption (me)
to build a 2.6.13-rc6-rt2 tree, the following patches should to be 
applied:
   
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.12.tar.bz2
   
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/testing/patch-2.6.13-rc6.bz2
