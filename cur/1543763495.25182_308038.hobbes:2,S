20050401 "Newland: I second Torvalds Motion, It's Time to Dump the Penguin"
Let us, on this most sacred day only, become a world of fools.  Let us
imagine the unimaginable.
Upon reading "Torvalds: It's Time to Dump the Penguin"

 I replied:
I propose we adopt the image of one of several Linus characters:
1) Linus of Peanuts fame, assuming the owner would grant a no-fee license
to the free software community, for GPL'd software only
2) Linus Pauling, perhaps the world's greatest chemist of all time
3) Linus of Linux fame, a geek of our own, to trump the be-spectacled image of
the Monopolist Corporation geek 
With all due respect to 3), I prefer option 1) so let me elaborate:
Please see:

Perhaps there is no bigger fool than I.  However, launching a
partnership that, in turn, launches the free software community's
write-once, run-anywhere operating system, media kit, etc., under the
visage of world loved cartoon characters would, as Emril would say,
let's "kick it up a notch", on the world stage of human comedy.
Linux, if course, gets Linus.  I dibs the free software product under
the flying doghouse image.  What do we do with the other characters:
Snoopy, Charlie Brown, Woodstock, Lucy, Sally, Schroeder, Peppermint
Patty, Marcie, Pigpen, Franklin, and Rerun?
Who's Rerun, well, "Rerun Van Pelt is often mistaken for Linus even
though he's his little brother."
