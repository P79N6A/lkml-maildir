The issue is not that the driver is not 'endian clean'.
This is a driver for an on-chip ethernet MAC on an ARM CPU.  I.e. the
ethernet MAC is on the CPU itself, it's not some kind of PCI device or
something like that.  The ARM CPU in question can be run in either
little endian or big endian mode.  Making a driver work in both modes
of operation is generally not just an issue of adding a couple of
be32_to_cpu()s in the right places.
For example, intel IXP2000 and IXP23xx CPU support in arch/arm only
supports big-endian mode of operation, and none of the associated
drivers support little-endian mode.
Most of the other CPU support in arch/arm only supports
little-endian mode, and none of the associated drivers support
big-endian mode.  According to your criterion, that would mean that
most of the ARM drivers (alsa, usb, framebuffer, networking, etc.)
should never have been accepted in the kernel tree in the first place.
