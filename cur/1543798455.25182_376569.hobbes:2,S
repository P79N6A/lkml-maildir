My apologies - that junk predates the events I'd been thinking about.
The rest of comments still stands - it was never used since the moment
of introduction...
Speaking of hardirq.h - come on; even argument about check being not
in the same place where the value is defined...
* we compare NR_IRQS and HARDIRQ_BITS
* one of them is defined in irq.h, another - in hardirq.h
* due to current header ordering, comparison works in irq.h and not in
hardirq.h
* if you change that ordering (which is a *big* patchset, even if you
manage to keep it with zero impact on other architectures) so that check
can go in either place, you can always put it into the place where it
would make more sense in new header ordering; it's not going to be make
patch heavier.
IMO for now it's a no-brainer - compile fix that moves comparison to the
place where another side of comparison is defined  vs.  header ordering
rework...  Sorry.
