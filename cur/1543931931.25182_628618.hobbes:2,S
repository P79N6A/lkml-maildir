You've provided no information. What we need:
*). A well formed report, complete with oops, panic, other output.
*). Description of how it "fails".
Note also that there is no upstream Linux "2.6.18-8.el5-xen" kernel.
There is a Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel release with that revision
(this is the one that shipped in the GA RHEL5.0 kernel). You should
contact your vendor for support with their kernel if you are unable to
provide a well-formed bug report against an upstream kernel release.
