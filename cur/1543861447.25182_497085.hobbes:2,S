This mean that every work->func() which may sleep delays cpu_down/up unpredictable,
not good. What about work->func which sleeps then re-queues itself? I guess we can
solve this, but this is what I said "other changes".
Also, lock_cpu_hotplug() should be per-cpu, otherwise we have livelock.
Not that I am against lock_cpu_hotplug (I can't judge), but its usage in run_workqueue
looks like complication to me. I may be wrong. But the main problem we don't have it :)
Oleg.
