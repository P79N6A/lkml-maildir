The DMA area is supposed to start at 1GB as seen from the BUS but the bus
addresses above (start, pc and end) are beyond 2 GB. If your machine has
less than 1 GB, then it is quite abnormal. 
In earlier versions both dma base and size were 1GB. Only the dma size has 
been changed to 2GB but not the dma base.
There is some dubious section in core_cia.h that seems to confuse dma base
and dma size. If it is so, this just break virt_to_bus() translations and
explains the breakage and the offending bus addresses above as well: 
You should give a try to the below simple changes (do it by hand):
 #if defined(CONFIG_ALPHA_GENERIC) || defined(CONFIG_ALPHA_SRM_SETUP)
 #define CIA_DMA_WIN_BASE		alpha_mv.dma_win_base
 #define CIA_DMA_WIN_SIZE		alpha_mv.dma_win_size
 #else
-#define CIA_DMA_WIN_BASE		CIA_DMA_WIN_SIZE_DEFAULT
+#define CIA_DMA_WIN_BASE		CIA_DMA_WIN_BASE_DEFAULT
 #define CIA_DMA_WIN_SIZE		CIA_DMA_WIN_SIZE_DEFAULT
 #endif
By the way, the core_pyxis stuff seems fine in this regard.
