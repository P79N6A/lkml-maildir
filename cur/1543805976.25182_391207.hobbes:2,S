No problem, I'm not a networking expert...
Ingo's response to these traces was that softirq preemption, which
simply offloads all softirq processing to softirqd and has been tested
in the -rt patchset for over a year, is the easiest solution.  Any
thoughts on that?  Personally, I'd rather fix the very few problematic
softirqs, than take such a drastic step - this softirq appears to be one
of the last obstacles to being able to meet a 1ms soft RT constraint
with the mainline kernel.
Thanks for looking at this; I'd be glad to test any patches...
