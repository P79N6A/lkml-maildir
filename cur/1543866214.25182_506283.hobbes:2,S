Patch for Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt is below.
Want more/different?
Is this part of drivers/scsi/Kconfig correct??
"""
config SCSI_LOGGING
	bool "SCSI logging facility"
	depends on SCSI
	---help---
	  This turns on a logging facility that can be used to debug a number
	  of SCSI related problems.
	  If you say Y here, no logging output will appear by default, but you
	  can enable logging by saying Y to "/proc file system support" and
	  "Sysctl support" below and executing the command
	  echo "scsi log token [level]" > /proc/scsi/scsi
	  at boot time after the /proc file system has been mounted.
	  There are a number of things that can be used for 'token' (you can
	  find them in the source: <file:drivers/scsi/scsi.c>), and this
	  allows you to select the types of information you want, and the
	  level allows you to select the level of verbosity.
