So, the 0.3 release went out...with VERSION=0.2 in the Makefile.  Oops.
Fortunately, $(VERSION) currently only affects the version number in the
pkg-config file sparse.pc.  If you have written some software that depends on
Sparse, uses pkg-config to check for it with a sufficient version number, and
hoped to depend on 0.3 or newer, my apologies.  Fortunately, I suspect few to
no people have done this.
I plan to put out a release shortly with a fix for this, as well as a couple
of additional opportunistic fixes.  I also plan to include a "make dist" with
some checks to prevent this from happening again.
