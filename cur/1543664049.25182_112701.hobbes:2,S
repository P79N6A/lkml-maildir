so basically it uses the rmap that we always had since at least 2.2 for
everything but anon mappings, right?  this is what DaveM did a few years
back too. This makes lots of sense to me, so at least we avoid the
duplication of rmap information, even if it won't fix the anonymous page
overhead, but clearly it's much lower cost for everything but anonymous
pages.
