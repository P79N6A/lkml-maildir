Your choice.  Just bear in mind that if CONFIG_MODULES=y but mtd
objects are built into the kernel then mtd _must_ have a correct link
order.  Consider a config with CONFIG_MODULES=y but every mtd option is
set to 'y', link order is critical.  The moment you have two or more
mtd modules built in then you are stuck with link order issues, no
matter what you do.  Of course you could invent and maintain your own
unique method for controlling mtd initialisation order ...
