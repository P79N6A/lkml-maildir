the lack of a stacking ability was deliberate (go back and read the 
archives). basicly no LSM was willing to admit that they weren't the 
be-all, end-all of security, so nobody was willing to consider that anyone 
would ever want anything else.
one method of doing the stacking would be for the LSM to not know about 
the stacking, but the kernel takes care of passing all requests through 
each LSM in order (if the LSMs can be staticly compiled the order should 
be able to be changed at compile time)
now, the existing policies for some LSM's may need to change, becouse 
they've been assuming that they only needed to check capabilities for 
UID=0, when they will now need to check them for everyone, but arguably, 
this was a bug masquerading as an optimization in the first place.

which LSM gets to declare the standards?

only if the stacking mode permits this. if it always requires passing 
through all the layers then this wouldn't be a problem.
Besides which, the MultiAdmin authors would probably be willing to make 
the nessasary changes to their LSM to play nicely with others anyway (but 
good programming practice would dictate that you don't count on it, and 
arrange for the other modules to approve as well)

as things are currently written, it's not possible to stack, so there is 
no order. change how things are written and you can make them safe.

the sysadmins need to be given enough rope, you don't know everything that 
they are trying to do, and you don't know what other LSMs going to do. so 
how can you possibly decide ahead of time what orders are safe?

no, LSM is not just for testing, LSM is an interface so that Linus doesn't 
need to pick the 'one true security model' and enforce it on everyone.
it's like freedom of religion, each religion belives that they are the one 
true path, but in exchange for the guarentee that they are not going to be 
percecuted, they reluctantly allow all other religions equal freedom. when 
religion passes from mearly strange to activly harmful (i.e. cults) you 
find the edge of the freedom.
similarly, LSMs need to accept the fact that some people don't want their 
flavor of security, so to avoid being thrown out entirely they need to 
allow other LSMs to exist, and use the same kernel hooks, even if they 
believe that the alturnatives are misguided. as long as an LSM is not 
activly harmful (as opposed to mearly being snake oil) it should be 
allowed.

which bits into which security features? Good, knowledgable people can't 
agree on what's right.
ending the bitrot just requires accepting the LSMs into the kernel as 
first-class options, it doesn't require declaring any one LSM (or even any 
part of any one LSM) as being the 'one right way' to do something and 
force everyone to use that way.
