Woot, PAT support: this time we mean it!!
I'll just give one comment after a reading your todo..

Yes, the main use for GPUs is to have RAM pages mapped WC, and placed into 
a GART on the GPU side, currently for Intel IGD we are okay as the CPU can 
access the GPU GART aperture, but other chips exist where this isn't 
possible, I think poulsbo and possible some of the AMD IGPs..
