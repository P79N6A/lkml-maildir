Your idea is nice, but the patch lacks a few things:
- SMP locking, what if some other process faults in this page
  between the atomic_read of the page count and the test later?
- testing if our process is the _only_ user of this swap page,
  for eg. apache you'll have lots of COW-shared pages .. it would
  be good to keep the page in memory for our siblings

Rik
