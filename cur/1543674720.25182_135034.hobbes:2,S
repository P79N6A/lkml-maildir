Hi Denis,
you should understand, that I really try not to reproduce the Problem,
since this is a VERY productive Database- and Fileserver.
So am seeking hints on known Bugs or just some hints.
For the Kernel-traces I assume that I would need some messages.
But for the kernel everything seems to be normal. At least there are
no messages in syslog.
