That's correct. There seems to be _some_ correlation with the aic7xxx
driver, but even that's so weak that it might just be that it just shows
up a lot because it is so popular. There's certainly a stronger
correlation with overclocking and overheating ;)
It should be noted that _all_ the 2.3.x corruption problems that have been
discussed have simply been due to bugs in the new page cache and buffer
cache code, and their interactions with low-level filesystems etc. That's
simply because a lot of things changed, and we're apparently finally
reaching a stable level now.
("stable" wrt 2.3.x does not mean bug-free in this case: I'm sure we'll be
hunting down races for the next few months, but the fundamental problems
seem to be sorting themselves out quite nicely).
