You already lose in that case today, as multiple irqs may come in 
from devices and eat up the stack.  The whole thing that led me down 
this line is seeing it happen in real life.  What remains to be done 
is to write an automated stack depth checker based on possible call 
chains that will calculate the maximum possible stack depth.  I've 
already got scripts for dumping the top stack users, it's a matter 
of writing code that can show us the possible call chains.
