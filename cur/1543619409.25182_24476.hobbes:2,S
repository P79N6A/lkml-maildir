I think Linus meant that A never got sent out before the developer did the B
version. Now A could be a even bigger bug than what it was intended to fix so the
developer really dont wan't the world to se that sucker but can't just send the B
changeset as it depends on A. So I guess he needs a easy way to make A just go
away. Basically just collaps A and B into the same changeset. This should probably
ony work on changeset that has not been pushed to other trees.
