(*cough*)
Scalability of module loading certainly seems to be a problem. 
A quick test on my dual PIII system shows a shocking 13 seconds 
to load and unload the "input.o" module 400 times.
With some improvements in this area, massively parallel SMP systems 
could parallelize module loading, and achieve thousands of module 
load/unload operations per second (MLUOPS).
Wouldn't that be useful!  No?
(Sorry, I couldn't resist.  I'm sure there are good reasons to work on 
this, the scalability issue just sounded funny to me.)
