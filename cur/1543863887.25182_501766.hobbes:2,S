Hi!
OK - i rechecked everything. We've 22 Servers with the DFI PM-12 
Mainboard with VIA Chipset.
But only the 5 oldest of them (before 2004 / 01 / 20) (we've buyed all 
in a range of 10 month) have this problem.
So i think it is a mixture of software and hardware problem. Perhaps DFI 
changed something on the mainboard (e.g. new revision) or there was a 
new BIOS Version on it.
But there must also changed something in the kernel.

You mean Kernel .configs?

On all 32bit Machines:
gcc -v
Reading specs from /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i486-linux/3.3.5/specs
Configured with: ../src/configure -v 
--enable-languages=c,c++,java,f77,pascal,objc,ada,treelang --prefix=/usr 
--mandir=/usr/share/man --infodir=/usr/share/info 
--with-gxx-include-dir=/usr/include/c++/3.3 --enable-shared 
--enable-__cxa_atexit --with-system-zlib --enable-nls 
--without-included-gettext --enable-clocale=gnu --enable-debug 
--enable-java-gc=boehm --enable-java-awt=xlib --enable-objc-gc i486-linux
Thread model: posix
gcc version 3.3.5 (Debian 1:3.3.5-13)
