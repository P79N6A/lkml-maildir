Yuck.  I did not realize it was this bad.  I knew about the SMP dependency,
but not the others.
Something I have wondered about for a while is how difficult would it be to
make SMP modules run in a non-SMP kernel.  Is it as easy as having the UP
kernels provide dummy locking functions which always say they aquired a lock
but dont really try?
Thanks,
Jim
