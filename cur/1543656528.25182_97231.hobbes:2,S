This may be a simple error on my part but I've tried everything.
Kernel: 2.5.51
SCSI driver compiled static
Kernel boots just fine, howeverl, "lsmod" gives me a messages: "QM_MODULES:
Function not implemented"
I checked my kernel configuration and Modules support is enabled and kernel
module loader is enabled.
Any ideas?
