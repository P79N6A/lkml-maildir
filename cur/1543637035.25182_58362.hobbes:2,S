How about adding an "cond_resched_lock()" primitive?
You can do it better as a primitive than as the written-out thing (the
spin_unlock() doesn't need to conditionally test the scheduling point
again, it can just unconditionally call schedule())
And there might be other places that want to drop a lock before scheduling
anyway.
