All of this (and the rest of the snipped email with suggested
improvements) makes pretty good sense. But would it not be better
to do this in stages?
1) Split the code out from cpusets
2) Move to configfs
3) Work on locking scalability, etc ...
Else it'd seem that we'll never get anywhere, and it'll all be
impossible to review anyway. Incremental improvement would seem to
be a much easier way to fix this stuff, to me.
