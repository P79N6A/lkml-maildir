Can't you just implement an arch-specific allocator for your 32KB
SRAM, then implement the DMA API streaming and dma_alloc/free APIs
on top of that?  Since this architecture is obviously not designed
for performance, it doesn't seem to be a big deal to have the streaming
APIs copy to/from the kmalloced (or whatever) buffer to/from the SRAM
allocated memory and then have those APIs return the proper dma_addr_t
for the embedded OHCI's address space view of the SRAM. Same thing
goes for implementing dma_alloc/free (used by dma_pool*). I don't
have the knowledge of USB subsystem buffer usage to know how quickly
that little 32KB of SRAM is going to run out. But at a DMA API level,
this seems doable, albeit with the greater possibility of negative
retvals from these calls.
