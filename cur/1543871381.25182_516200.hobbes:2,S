Yes, posix_fallocate shouldn't be made more complicated.  But I don't
understand why requesting linear layout of the blocks should be an
option.  It's always an advantage if the blocks requested this way are
linear on disk.  So, the kernel should always do its best to make this
happen, without needing an additional option.
