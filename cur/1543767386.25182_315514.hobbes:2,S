That would cause uninterruptible sleep, which contributes to load average.

Nope, the do-while is a basic part of the daemon's operation: keep doing
stuff until either there's no stuff to do or until we're told to exit.

Nope, the wait_event_interruptible test says
  "sleep unless the list is not empty or I am being asked to exit"
the while termination test says
  "loop until the list is empty and I am being asked to stop".
I think.  I had to scratch my head for a while over that code ;)
