I'm not asking greg to reject the patch nor dictating Mark Mauler change it.
Since greg is willing to accept a patch to "fix" it, I'm willing to provide 
the patch in this case. I think that's fairly normal way to clean things up.

While it is valid C, "=" occasionally gets confused with "==".
And adding unnecessary parens to an if() statement increases the
risk someone will misread the line.  "someone" includes me. :)
