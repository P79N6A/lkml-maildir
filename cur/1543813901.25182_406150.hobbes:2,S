Hello from the uk,
I upgrade old raq3/4 servers to newer operating systems usually centos.
There is still thousands of them out there, hosting websites.
People realise that these old boxes are still good for hosting, as you
dont need a super 3ghz server for a few small web sites...
I wonder if you would consider adding cobalt hardware support to the 2.6
kernel tree?
