it worked upon the first try, and indeed my testbox crashed within 10 
seconds:
 BUG: Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference
 BUG: Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000006
  printing eip:

it was enough to "ssh 10.0.0.1" from the client, and typing "yes" would 
trigger the crash very soon.
thanks for the instructions - now i can start debugging this :-)
