Yes, though see my followup to Jean's note.  Unless I make time
to test this out on some system, the issues seem to be:
 (a) will need to change once gpio_direction_output() gains
     that second argument;
 (b) i2c-gpio.h could stand one minor comment addition to highlight
     an assumption.
Looking good!
