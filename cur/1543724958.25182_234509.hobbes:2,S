Hi there,
After not being able to find the vt8231 module for the latest 2.6.X Kernel ,
i merged the i2c/chips/VT8231.C to 2.6.X , and it's working almost ok, but i
have  a strange output, it's showing up 3 times like this :
vt8231-isa-fffe
.. bla..
vt8231-isa-6000
.. bla..
vt8231-isa-0000
..bla..
Somehow, i managed to let the system think it was 3 times inserted (?)
Can somebody shine a small light on this ? i promise i won't bother you guys
to much.
I have placed the code at : 
http://www.tser.org/vt8231/
I have to fix some small other bits before it's ok. But i think i will
manage that. (like as correcting the 12V :)
Kinds regards
		Reinder Kraaij.
