Splitting source and object directories is indeed sane. But SUSE
implementation broke the 'build' symlink which has been the recommended way
for a long time to get to the main kernel Makefile directory.

I have asked you n times to refrain from merging the 'build' symlink
breakage. I ask you again to not merge that breakage.
Please merge the 'object' symlink version instead.

SUSE folks made a silly mistake and broke stuff. It was even more silly for
them to try to submit that breakage to mainline.
