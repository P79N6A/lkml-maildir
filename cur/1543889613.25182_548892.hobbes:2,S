Thing is, this new interpretation and usage of PG_error is worrisome.  For
example, I don't think we've previously made any effort to avoid starting
writeback against PageError() pages.  We may be avoiding it in certain
places, but it wasn't a design rule of any sort.  And any such code hasn't
had any useful testing: PageError() is a damn rare thing.
So my reason for asking the above is to try to find a way to make all these
new PG-error games just go away.

As I say, no effort has been made to enforce anything like that.

Would be better, I think, to be able to remove all this new PG_error stuff.
