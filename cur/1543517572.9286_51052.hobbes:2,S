Hmm...
Anyway, I'll fix up the IPC stuff to preserve backwards compatibility with
libc5; I'm afraid I'm too young to remember libc4 :)
Does this mean that I can't rename the system calls from getuid to
getuid16, etc., either? (at worst, my changes to unistd.h may cause
problems to those who recompile the C library against the new kernel
headers, but shouldn't affect ordinary program compiles)
Thanks,
Chris Wing
