I've been using the "Linux from Scratch" (LFS) document as a guide for building
a basic Linux system. The only things I've done outside the instructions
include:
1. Built 32 bit version of binutils, gcc, glibc for s390x
2. Built kernel
3. Created /root64 and populated it with /usr /bin etc.
4. Built 64-bit libncurses
I've now built statically linked 64-bit versions of:
1. bash
2. bzip2
3. diffutils
4. fileutils
These are all installed in the /root64 tree.
According to the LFS instructions I should now build grep, gzip, make,
sed, shellutils, tar, and textutils, before going onto the next phase.
However, I cannot find grep, sed, or tar srpms on the SuSE CDs.
In any event, progress is being made.
