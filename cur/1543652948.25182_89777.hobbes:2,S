  Same comment, I want (a) something which will remake everything
including *versions.h to be sure I didn't mess anything up, and (b) as a
but removed the editor and patch backup files ready for distribution. I
don't want to lose the patch backup files (I care less about editor files,
my chosen editor doesn't make them) but I want to be able to easily
identify what has changed without keeping a full unmodified copy of the
tree.
