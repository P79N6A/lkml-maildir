statm_pgd_range(pgd, vma->vm_start, vma->vm_end, &pages, &shared, &dirty, &total);
                                                  ^^^^^
`pages' there is the number of actually resident pages, yes?
And it gets fed into trs, drs and lrs.
But converting it to this:
+               int pages = (vma->vm_end - vma->vm_start) >> PAGE_SHIFT;
...
+               if (vma->vm_flags & VM_SHARED)
+                       shared += pages;
Will mean that `shared' can be vastly overestimated.   I think??

A walk in split_vma would be unpopular..  Could we separate mm->rss
up into text, stack and library or something?
Or do we just not care?  I guess it's conceivably useful to know
the residency of each mapping, but there doesn't seem to be an
existing proc interface for that anyway.  And having them all
rolled up into an mm-wide number is a lot of information loss.
