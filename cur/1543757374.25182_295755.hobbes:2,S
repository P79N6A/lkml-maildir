Well, we just went through another round of 'BK sucks' and 'BK sucks, we need 
to switch to something else'.
Sans the flamewar, are there any options? CVS and SVN are out because they do 
not support 'off server' branches (arch and darcs do). Darcs would probably 
be the best choice because its easy to use, and the darcs team almost has a 
working linux-kernel import script (originally designed to just test darcs 
with a huge repo, but provides a mostly working linux tree).
So, without the flamewar, what is everyone's opinion on this?
