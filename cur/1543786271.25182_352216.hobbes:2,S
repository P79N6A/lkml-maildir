Thats odd.  I followed the directions in the message near the head of
this thread, and after I fixed my $PATH to include ~/bin:, it
just worked, and I made a copy of it to my /usr/src dir & built
it. I've been running 2.6.14-rc2 for about 00:02:17 now. And it seems
to be running nominally so far.  Or at least thats the version in the 
Makefile.  :-)
