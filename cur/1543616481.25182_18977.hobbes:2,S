I just got a Tyan Tiger K7 and experienced a similar problem. The
keyboard locked up when gpm started, but it came back after I
stopped gpm (by logging in remotely). I discovered in my BIOS that
the mouse was configured to "Automatic". Changing it to "Enabled"
fixed my problem.
I suggest checking your BIOS for anything related to the mouse. It
could be occurring because the interrupt is not getting assigned
for the mouse by the BIOS, or something to that effect. That is
what my thoughts are on this problem. After seeing reports of the
interrupt counts in /proc/interrupts not being updated while the
mouse (/dev/psaux) is opened, it made me think that it could be an
IRQ problem.
