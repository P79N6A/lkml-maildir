It could be corrected ECC errors in the cache. If that
happens I would consider it a hardware problem
(now hidden with the disabled bank).

I maintain that such a magic hack needs at least a big fat comment.
I still find the change very suspicious, there isn't any errata that 
says that bank 0 is bad on Athlon.
Also disabling a whole bank just for some buggy CPUs is quite a sledgehammer,
it would be probably better to identify the bank 0 sub unit that causes it
and only turn that off.
