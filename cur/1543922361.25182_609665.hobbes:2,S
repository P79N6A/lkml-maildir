Absolutely...

I figured that, in the absence of a true, defined BAR concept, the 
struct device version would simply index into the discussed array of 
struct resource.  That means any ordering or layout of resources should 
work, presuming (the usual case) that both driver and platform agree on 
the resource layout.
