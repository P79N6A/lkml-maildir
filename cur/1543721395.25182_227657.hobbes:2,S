I don't know why gcc-3.2.2 doesn't complain about this one, as I have
compiled this numerous times.
Your patch has an unnecessary include of jfs_dtree.h.  jfs_dtree.h is
included by jfs_inline.h, and is not needed in jfs_dtree.c.

My guess is the config entry is CONFIG_JFS_FS. :^)
Here's the patch without the unneeded include:
