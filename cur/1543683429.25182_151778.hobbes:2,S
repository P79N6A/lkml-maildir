Let me begin by saying that I find the menu arrangement (both before
and after this patch) highly subjective.
I.e., there's not necessarily a right or wrong. (RR:)
I.e., in the absence of further input, some maintainer can decide.  :)
Given the above:
I prefer short menus.  I find them more readable, with less clutter.
So I don't mind them the way that they currently are.
OTOH, I don't care strongly either way.  I think that we should
care more about how non-developers use and see 'make *config'
than how kernel developers use and see it.
