I heard that if you install the new module-init-tools package in
/sbin that you would be able to boot old kernels. Is that true?
I installed the module-init-tools package and it went to /usr/local.
First I changed the kernel Makefile to point to /usr/local then
I had module problems and tried copying the cmds to /sbin and 
renamed the the old commands like implied in the script:
 		generate-modprobe.conf
Yesterday I heard I better move them back or I won't be able
to boot my old kernels. It's hard to believe that these tools
aren't backward compatible.
Moving the module-init-tools to /sbin didn't help my problem;
is it necessary/helpful. Perhaps they are only needed for 
building the new kernels.
