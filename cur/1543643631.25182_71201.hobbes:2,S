   Wasn't there a patch submitted which suggested to add pci_dma_prep_*()
   calls in order to sync the cpu-driven changes back to the bus? I'm asking
   because I'm dealing with a driver that needs to reuse streaming pci maps.
Yes, basically this is what must happen.
If someone would code up a patch that includes the MIPS
implementation, adds NOP implementations to every other asm/pci.h file
and updates the Documentation/DMA-mapping.txt file appropriately,
I'll probably just apply the patch and merge it upstream immediately.
I don't have time to work on this patch right now and I don't know how
the MIPS part should be implemented so...
