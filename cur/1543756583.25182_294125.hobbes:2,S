Unit tests are nice and your approach is wrong. The test does not
belong in the implementation for two reasons: it hurts readability of
the actual code and the _commented out_ test will not be maintained
(dead code never is).
I don't know if the maintainers are interested in unit tests but a
better solution would be to  put your test in a separate file and make
sure it is always compiled and executed when CONFIG_UNIT_TEST is
enabled.
P.S. If the test fails, it probably should do BUG().
