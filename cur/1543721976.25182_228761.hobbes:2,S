Why do you say 'must be blocked' instead of 'should not be printed'?
The former implies some kind of post-processing to work around buggy
kernel code printing crap. Surely it's better just to refrain from
printing the crap in the first place?
Btw, your replies lack a correct References: and In-Reply-To: header, in
violation of a 'SHOULD' in RFC2822 §3.6.4. Please fix this if you wish
to participate in public fora.
