That also fell over.

To me it seems to have happened somewhere between 2.6.15.6 and 2.6.16.1 :)
I'll have to boot with 2.6.15.6 again and run that for a couple of days,
after that I'll try some kernel  2.6.15.6 < x < 2.6.16.1 (any
suggestions?)

Hmm, what version of xfs_repair is supposed to fix that? Because neither
the 2.6.20 version that comes with Debian nor the CVS version of August
10 which calls itself 2.8.11 makes it go away (i.e. multiple runs will
persistently show those lines).
