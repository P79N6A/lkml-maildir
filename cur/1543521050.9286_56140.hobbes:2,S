The problem I reported an hour ago is traced to the loop device.
If I do:
dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/foo bs=1k count=1500
mke2fs -Fq /tmp/foo 1500 
mount -o loop /tmp/foo /mnt
cp /junk/* /mnt
umount /mnt
Then remount:
mount -o loop /tmp/foo /mnt
The contents are corrupt!
 
If I `sync ; sleep 1 ` before I unmount the file, then the contents
are okay if I remount it.
I just booted on such a ramdisk. There is some corruption because the
kernel announced that it was mounting an "unchecked file-system" when
it was mounting the ram-disk. Subsequent mounting of the real root
worked okay, though.
Cheers,
