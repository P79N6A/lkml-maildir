Maybe each driver could pass back a value indicating
1) all done
2) N milliseconds more, please
and you could keep calling until every driver says all done. The
all-done drivers would ignore any new interrupts. The Not-Yet drivers
could get the last few interrupts the need to complete. Of course
there would need to be an overall timeout. That would leave most of
the responsibility with the drivers... who know most of the true
requirements.
