I think that it works due to pure luck. XFree's mga driver reprograms 
some accelerator registers (namely color depth and horizontal line length)
under some circumstances (like when gnome's clock applet in right upper
corner changes value - i.e. every second or every minute depending on
setting when DRI is enabled) even if XFree are not on foreground.  This
causes serious problems, as then you are running console at (say) 640x480/8bpp,
but accelerator gets set to 1280x1024/32bpp, painting 16x larger characters
to screen :-(
I know only three workarounds: either do not use DRI, or disable use of
accelerator on console (fbset -accel false), or use same vxres and depth
on console and in X (or fourth: fix XFree driver to not touch hardware
when they are not on foreground...).
