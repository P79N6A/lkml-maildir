Sounds a lot like moving and resizing GL windows in X. A similar (if not
the same mechanism) could be used here. Whenever a client takes the lock
and detects that someone else had the lock in the mean time it checks
for a new window position and size. Checking for a changed mode or frame
buffer layout would fit in nicely. AFAIK these kind of changes are
communicated through the sarea which is shared by all DRI clients, the
Xserver and the kernel driver, so the checks are pretty low cost (no
system calls or context switches required).
You only have to take the lock before changing the mode. DRI clients and
X will detect the change when they take the lock the next time and
adjust to the new conditions.
