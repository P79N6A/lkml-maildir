	That was kind of the idea... There is a reason for flagging code
	DANGEROUS. Only people who really doesn't care if their dogs die, their
	grandmas get abducted by aliens, their disks crashed and their screens

	EXPERIMENTAL code.
You are entirely mistaken.
If I enable EXPERIMENTAL, it is not because I want to be a hacker,
it is because my machine has a RealTek 8139 ethernet card.
(Yes, it works fine, thank you.)
	It's all a question of psychology. While EXPERIMENTAL sounds cool and
	inviting, DANGEROUS doesn't quite have that ring to itself...
No. That is why we shouldnt use DANGEROUS.
