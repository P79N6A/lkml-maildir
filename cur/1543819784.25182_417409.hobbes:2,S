What about marking the pages Read-Only while it's being used by the
kernel and if the user tries to write into them letting the VM dup 
the page with the COW code? Often you can use a FILO memory allocator 
in user space to minimize the odds of trying to reuse the page while 
the kernel is using it.
FreeBSD folks developed a ZERO_COPY_SOCKET facility that uses COW; 
code looked great.
