That's not what I wrote. I just wrote about doing forwarding table lookup
and MMIO so that dedicated hardware NICs can process the recv/send to the
correct ends. If you just need to scan a list of DMAed packets, look at
their destination IP address, lookup that IP in a table to find the output
NIC and destination MAC address, link them into an output list and waking
the output NIC up, there's nothing which requires more than 400 cycles
here. I never said that it was a requirement to pass through the existing
network stack.

I don't see where you see a userspace (or I don't understand your test).
On traffic generation I often do from user space, I can send 630 k raw
ethernet packets per second from userspace on a 1.8 GHz opteron and PCI-e
NICs. That's 2857 cycles per packet, including the (small amount of)
userspace work. That's quite cheap.

Well, in my example above, everythin in the path of the send() syscall down
to the bare metal NIC is under high pressure in a fast loop. 30 cycles
already represent 1% of the performance! In fact, to modulate speed, I
use a busy loop with a volatile int and small values.

Yes, the most common examples found today involve applications reading
data from databases. For instance, let's say that one function in your
program must count the number of unique people with the name starting
with an "A". It is very common to see "low-level" primitives to abstract
the database for portability purposes. One of such primitives will
generally be consist in retrieving a list of people with their names,
age and sex in one well-formated 3-column array. Many lazy people will
not see any problem in calling this one from the function described
above. Basically, what they would do is :
 count_people_with_name_starting_with_a()
    -> array[name,age,sex] = get_list_of_people()
         -> while read_one_people_entry() {
               alloc(one_line_of_3_columns)
               read then parse the 3 fields
               format_them_appropriately
            }
    -> create a new array "name2" by duplicating the "name" column
    -> name3 = sort_unique(name2)
    -> name4 = name3.grep("^A")
    -> return name4.count
Don't laugh, I've recently read such a horrible thing. It was done
that way just because it was easier. Without the abstraction layer,
the coder would have been forced to access the base anyway and would
have seen an added value into just counting from the inner while
loop, saving lots of copies, greps, sort, etc... :
 count_people_with_name_starting_with_a() {
      count = 0;
      while read_one_people_entry() {
         read the 3 fields into a statically-allocated buffer
         if (name[0] == 'A') count++;
      }
      return count;
 }
I'm not saying that the above was not possible, just that it's
1000% easier to do the former without even having to think that
the final code uses such horrible things. And yes, I can confirm
that when you see this, you want to shoot the author !

Agreed. But most often, the abstraction prevents the user from accessing
some information directly and that becomes nasty. I remember when I was
a teen, I wrote a program designed to inventory what you had in your PC,
and run a few performance tests. It ran in those semi-graphical DOS mode
where you use graphics characters to draw boxes. I initially wrote all
the windowing code myself and it ran perfectly. I once decided to rewrite
it using TurboVision, the windowing framework from Borland (it was written
in TurboPascal). I made intensive use of the equivalent of a putchar()
function to write text in a window. You cannot imagine my pain when I
ran it on my old 8088, it wrote at the speed of a 1200 bps terminal. I
then tried to find how to write faster, even by accessing the window
buffer directly. I couldn't. I had to reverse-engineer the internal
structures by debugging memory contents in order to find the pointers
to the window buffer to write to them directly. After this disastrous
experience with abstraction, I thought "never that crap again".

What I'm complaining about is that when you don't want those fancy things,
you still have them to justify the hundreds of megs. And even if you manage
to print to stdout, you still have a huge runtime just in case you'd like
to use the fancy features.

Also, algorithmic research is very little rewarding. You can work for
months or years thinking you found the nice algo for the job, then
finally discover a limitation you did not expect and throw that amount
of work to the bin in a few minutes.

That's interesting that you cite epoll() vs select(). I measured the
break-even point around 1000 FDs. Below, select() is faster. Above,
epoll() is faster. On small number of entries (less than 100), a select
based proxy can be 20-30% faster than the same one running on epoll()
because select() while dumber is cheaper to set up.

That's true when you seek a lot. When you manage to mostly perform sequential
reads (such as what you do when processing large files such as logs), you can
easily achieve 80 MB/s, which is 20000 pages/s, or 100 times faster.

Oh there are many primitives which are generally optimized in assembly for
this reason. What randomly comes to my mind :
  - graphics libraries. Saving 1 cycle per pixel in a rectangle drawing
    primitive can have an important impact in animated graphics for
    instance.
  - video/audio and generally multimedia code. I remember a specially
    written version of mpg123 about 10 years ago, which was optimized
    for i486 and which was the only one able to run on a 486 without
    skipping.
  - crypto code. It's common to find CPU-specific DES or AES functions.
    Take a look at John The Ripper. I don't know if it still exists,
    but there was an Alpha-optimized DES function which was something
    like 5 times faster than the generic C one. It changes a lot of
    things when you have 1 day to check your users passwords.
I also wrote a netfilter log analyzer which parses 300000 lines per
second on my 1.7 GHz notebook. That's 5600 cycles to read a full
line, lookup the field names, extract the values, parse them (atoi,
aton) save them in a structure, apply a filter, insert the result
in a tree containing up to 12 millions of them, and dump a report
of the counts by any creteria. That saved me a lot of time working
on log analysis. But to achieve such a speed, I had to optimize at
every level, including rewriting a faster atoi() equivalent, a
faster aton() equivalent (with no multiplies), and playing with
likely/unlikely a lot. The code slowly improved from about 75k
lines/s to 300k lines/s with no algorithmic change. Just by the
way of careful code placement and ordering.
In fact, you could say that micro-optimizations are not important
if you are doing them in a crappy environment where the fast path
is already wasted by a big dirty function. But when you have the
ability to master all the environment, every single cycle counts
because there's almost no waste.
I find it essential not to be the first one bringing crap somewhere
and serving as an excuse for others not to care about their code.
If everyone cares, you can still produce very good software, and
that's what I care about.
Cheers,
Willy
