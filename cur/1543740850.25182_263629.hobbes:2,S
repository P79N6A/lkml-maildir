The current version is -U10.3
Find below a patch against -U10.3. It contains a couple of smaller fixes
including the network driver bootup BUG.
<Dislaimer>
I'm trying to start a serious discussion on that. It's not my intention
to start a flamewar. 
</Disclaimer>
The network driver load/unload problem, which was reported from a couple
of testers, is related to Ingo's check inside of atomic_dec_and_test().
        if (!atomic_read(v)) {
                printk("BUG: atomic counter underflow at:\n");
                dump_stack();
        }
The unmodified atomic_dec_and_test() returns 0 in all cases except for
the case when the counter is 0 after the decrement. This implementation
covers automatically the case, where atomic_dec_and_test() is called
with counter == 0.
The network code uses atomic_dec_and_test() in qdisk_destroy to check,
if the caller owns the last reference to the qdisc. This covers also the
case when no reference is there when this is called. I fixed this for
now with a check for 0 before calling qdisk_destroy().
Thats a fix, but not an answer to the following question.
The question is whether the atomic implementation is intended to allow
counter values less than 0 or not. Reviewing the usage it seems not to
be the case. The qdisc_destroy code is the only place I recognized so
far, which makes use of that implementation detail.
>From my point of view is allowing such usage covering a hidden problem. 
Assume count = 0, call atomic_dec_test() and you have count = -1. 
At a differemt places the check is if (!atomic_read(v)){...}
If count = -1 it signals, that data or whatever is available.  
I don't think there is code which is actually failing on that, but as a
design rule it might turn out that Ingo's check and the implied rule
"count must be >= 0" is appropriate.
