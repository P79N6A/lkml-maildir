there is a huge problem with this though: Depending on your graphics
chip, it's the graphics driver, not the bios, that does the backlight
control......  in fact the trend in hardware (this is what windows
does) is have the OS take over the control of all of this as soon as
possible...
Linux should do this with software control as well for that reason; the
other approach just isn't going to be possible in the long term ;(
