I remember removing it, I just don't remeber why. may I thought that there
was enough information carried by the ip argument (i.e. where you were
interrupted), but I don't see a problmen in passing pt_regs again. The
documentation clearly hints at that. I'll do that in the next patch
for all platforms.
Thanks.
