Hi,
Since the ACPI standard is quite comprehensive and unifies a number of
(legacy) systems for hardware control and enumeration, it would be great to
see how much interest there is in getting this further implemented.
ACPI4Linux only seems to deal with power management, but some of the other
features could benefit.
Unified support for hardware enumeration, multi-processor tables etc looks a
much nicer solution than Intel MPS. Objects like Thermal Zones and Fan
Devices sound quite powerful for intelligent power management etc. This may
allow things like the OS turning on an internal fan if thermal sensor X
exceeds temperature threshold T etc, sending notifications etc.
