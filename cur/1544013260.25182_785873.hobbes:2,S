Wait a sec...  
There is a patch interdependency here.
This patch includes the text for the two proposed sysctls.  If they are
rejected, then this help text will refer to two non-existent sysctls.
Minor issue compared to:
The pdflush sysctl patch was respun to include adding text (against the
current vm.txt) for the new sysctls.  So that patch will fail to apply
should this patch be added first. 
See what I mean? So what do I do?
Thx,
