Removing the AM53C974 driver sounds like a good idea, but be aware that the 
tmscsim driver included on the RedHat driver disks (for people who have to 
boot by floppy) causes a panic on boot ever since 7.3 on XU 5/90 machines. 
The AM53C974 driver is very minimalistic, but seems to work. Once the system 
is installed, the AM53C974 driver isn't stable long-term and I have to use 
tmscsim.
So before deleting the driver, keep in mind that without it, there would be 
no way to install RedHat's distros on the older Vectra's. Of course the 
tmscsim driver included on the RedHat driver disk could be broken...
