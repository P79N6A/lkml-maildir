Yes, and not only that, it also switches the keyboard to codeset 3 if possible
to avoid PS/2 -> AT keycode conversion. (The default setup without my patches
is that the keyboard does PS/2 -> AT conversion and the i8042 does AT -> XT 
conversion. This really messes it up, and that's why the current pc_keyb.c
is so complex).
