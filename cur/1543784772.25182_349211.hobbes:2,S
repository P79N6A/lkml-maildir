Well, Doc*/pm.txt seems to say this is "not to use"
Driver Interface -- OBSOLETE, DO NOT USE!

anyway, if you want a comment "what to do with it", here it is:

Tell people not to use pm_register().

 Driver Interface -- OBSOLETE, DO NOT USE!
 ----------------*************************
+
+Note: pm_register(), pm_access(), pm_dev_idle() and friends are
+obsolete. Please do not use them. Instead you should properly hook
+your driver into the driver model, and use its suspend()/resume()
+callbacks to do this kind of stuff.
+
 If you are writing a new driver or maintaining an old driver, it
 should include power management support.  Without power management
 support, a single driver may prevent a system with power management
