Applications should be notified that something is broken. If you have
a professional environment, you really need to know, if the output 
survived all scheduling peaks and the audio data are delivered from/to
I/O in time.
Also, in the standard consumer environment is good to know that the system
have some trouble to deliver data in time (motivating developers of core 
Linux kernel code or subsystems, or motivating app programers to set the 
correct scheduling parameters) to fix remaining problems.
