 I did. Not standalone, but in the combination of:
2.4.17+preempt+lock-break+vmscan.c+read_latency
 Had to merge/frop some of the changes, as they are already they already
were in lock-break. So far, the stuff works -> no hangs/freezes/oopses.
 My goal in applying this stuff is to get better interactivity and
responsiveness on my laptop (320 MB, eithe 2x or no swap).
 The biggest improvements I had recently was the patch to vmscan.c by
Martin v. Leuwen and the inclusion of the read_latency stuff from Andrea
(?). That basically removed all the memory problems (cache forcing
excessive swapping out) and IO hangs (vmware doing IO freezing system
for 10s of seconds).
 preempt, lock-break and I think mini-ll have further improved the
interactive "feeling". And no, I have no hard data. I am not into
Audio/DVD palyback, so ultra-low worst case latency is not my ultimate
desire. Great VM+IO performance while having great interactivity is :-)
Which probably brings us back to the topic of this thread :-))
