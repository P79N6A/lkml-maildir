start by making tree_lock (write) private, using the interface
detailed below.  No one should be able to add/remove pages from the
address space without going through the a_ops interface.  this patch
is part of a (much) larger unfinished, and outdated, set intended to
put this interface in place.  people familiar with this code will
immediately note that there are a few hard problems to solve here,
most notably the various {truncate|invalidate}_mapping_pages calls,
and the locking involved.  Cleaning up the inode reclaim paths a bit
should help this, and that work is unfinished as well.
I'm always hesitant to post stuff like this, because -ENOPATCH is
really an appropriate response here.
