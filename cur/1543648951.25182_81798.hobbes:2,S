The problem with modifying the executable code/pages in the vsyscall
area is that it's going to be very tricky to implement, if I understand
this discussion properly.
There may be any number of user processes idling in these pages on the
runqueue (or off it if say one received a SIGSTOP), and if you just go
change the instruction code on them, unless you're incredibly careful
and come up with some subtly safe machine code sequence, they're going
crash when you call this sysctl().
It seems like this indicates that you have to start getting crazy at
that point.  That is, what you need to do is scan through all processes
on the runqueue (and also any that might be eg. frozen) and examine
their pc.  If it's in the vsyscall area, either complete the system call
for them, or somehow roll-back their register state and reset their PC
to the start of the vsyscall function.
Just using a test in the vsyscall to check a variable seems like a much
cleaner global approach.  It has its own problem though, since processes
that are idling in the vsyscall pages may wake up after vsyscalls have
been disabled.  It seems like they could then be prone to return the
wrong result, if say the offset data was no longer being updated
properly by the kernel because of the mode change.
Making it per-process should avoid these problems nicely, at least, so
long as the process disabling vsyscalls knows what it's doing and
doesn't try to call the sysctl from a signal handler or something.
