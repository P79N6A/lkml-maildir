actually, you dont need high-res or fast HZ or TSC to reduce those timer 
artifacts: all you need is _two_ (low-res, slow) hw clocks.
Most platforms do have that (even the really really cheap ones), but 
arches do not set up the scheduler tick one of them and the timer tick 
to the other, and to skew the periodic-timer programming setup a bit (by 
nature of physics they are usually already skewed a bit) so that the 
scheduler tick and timer tick are not coupled. This whole thing is not a 
big deal on embedded anyway. (you dont get students log in to the 
toaster or to the fridge to run timer exploits, do you? :-)
