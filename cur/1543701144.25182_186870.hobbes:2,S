I'm planning to go with the device mapping in 2.6.0 to setup RAID1 using my
Promise TX2000 card. How do I know which device name it will choose? I have
looked in the 'devices.txt' but there is neither a ide-raid nor a specific
Promise device name mapping. Please advice.

because ataraid is nothing more than a devicemapper....
duplicating that is rather silly... 
The outcome is to be a /sbin/ataraid binary or some such that will do all
the magic to detect the raid and tell the kernel device mapper to set it all
up.

I sent it to Marcelo for applying last week, and he applied it today
