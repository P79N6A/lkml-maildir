We could just introduce them as required, though? clear_bit_fence shouldn't
be required for ia64 any longer, if you change bitops to be full barriers,
right?
And for now, let's just not let people open critical sections unless doing
a test_and_set, nor close them unless doing a plain clear?
It seems that memory ordering model seems to be almost too much for people
to cope with already, so would it be reasonable to require some performance
justification before adding more?
