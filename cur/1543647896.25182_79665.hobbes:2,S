I experienced this exact problem a few months ago.  I had a test where
several clients read a file or files cached on a linux server.  TCP was just
fine, I could get 100% CPU on all CPUs on the server.  TCP zerocopy was even
better, by about 50% throughput.  UDP could not get better than 33% CPU, one
CPU working on those UDP requests and I assume a portion of another CPU
handling some inturrupt stuff.  Essentially 2P and 4P throughput was only as
good as UP throughput.  It is essential to get scaling on UDP.  That
combined with the UDP zerocopy, we will have one extremely fast NFS server.
