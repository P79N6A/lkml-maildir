Yeah, let's just do it. It's going to be unfair, but let's see if the 
unfairness is going to actually be noticeable in real life. I suspect it 
isn't, and if it is, we can look at it again and see if there are other 
approaches.
If it makes _that_ much of a difference on dbench, it's worth being unfair 
even if it's just for some dubious benchmark.
