Thanks Tomas,
weird it is, it has me stumped. I'm no spring chicken with linux systems 
and i also have a slackware 8.1 system running fine on PCchips hardware 
for years. (well since slackware 8.1 came out, and before that it had 
7). But this is the only machine i've ever run a distro kernel on.
umounting /proc removes the problem.
what could be in there in proc that would be causing it? something 
misrepresented about the memory? or some other resource?
One thing i have noticed is that this happens:
kernel: PCI_IDE: unknown IDE controller on PCI bus 00 device f9, 
VID=8086, DID=24cb
kernel: PCI: Device 00:1f.1 not available because of resource collisions
on boot.
I sent some more info about the problem earlier to linux-kernel.
