I have to admit that I didn't really design this patch with 
suspend/resume in mind, and that I'm not too familiar with how they work.
Do the HPET/ACPI timers still run while the system is suspended?
If not, there shouldn't be any problem, as long as the kernel is 
informed of the resume early enough.
