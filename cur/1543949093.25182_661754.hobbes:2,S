There was no irq involved in the above pseudocode, the irq if
something would run in the remote system. Still irqs can run fine
during the while loop like they run fine on top of
smp_call_function. The send-irq and the following spin-on-a-bitflag
works exactly as smp_call_function except this isn't a numa-CPU to
invalidate.

Agreed. I just thought xpmem needed an invalidate-by-page, but
I'm glad if xpmem can go in sync with the KVM/GRU/DRI model in this
regard.
