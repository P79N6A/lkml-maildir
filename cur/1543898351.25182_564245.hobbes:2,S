The leal instruction (Load Effective Address) is often used as a way to
add a constant to one register and store the result in another register
in a single instruction.  The values don't even have to be addresses at
all, since no memory is actually referenced.  Otherwise this would be
written as:
	movl %edi,%ecx
	addl $0x007, %ecx
