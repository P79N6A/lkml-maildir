No, there is no nasty locking, when the callback happens, pretty much
all IOs have stopped anyway due to errors, and we aren't on a critical
code path.
Polling for error might be possible, but async notification is the way
to go because whatever does error management need to be able to
separately: 
 - notify all drivers on the affected bus segment
 - one the above is done, and based on system/driver capabilities (API
to be defined) eventually re-enable IO access and do a new round of
notifications
 - based on system/driver capabilities, eventually reset the slot and
notify drivers to re-initialize themselves.
