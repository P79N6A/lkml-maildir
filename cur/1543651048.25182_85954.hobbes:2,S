Perhaps i'm being grossly naive here, but none of these presumably x86 
productions servers don't have a serial port? Not even PCI/ISA slots to 
add one? Serial would catch most of your oopsen anyway, and if you were 
borked enough that serial couldn't get the entire output, i somehow doubt 
dumping to disk could manage. And no i don't see anything wrong nor 
consider it studly to use oopses only for debugging...
