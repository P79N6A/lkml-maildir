Another possible way to fix this is to put the page_count check back in
the invalidate_*_* under the tree_lock (exactly like the VM does in
shrink_caches and exactly like 2.4 does too!), and to stop removing
pages from pagecache if their page_count is > 1 (we would go back to
clear PG_uptodate). But then we'd have a problem once again with the
PG_utpodate bitflag being cleared by invalidate_*_* while do_no_page is
running, and in turn a mapped page could have PG_uptodate clear 8),
that's the invariant that lead us to start zapping the ptes and dropping
pagecache, so then we could stop zapping the ptes too like 2.4 and
allowing PG_uptodate to be clear (there's nothing fundamentally wrong
with that, as long as the buffers BH_uptodate are clear too).
Side note: in 2.6 invalidate_mapping_pages has been smp racy at least since
2.6.5, it basically broke when the page_count check was replaced with a
page_mapping check long ago. But it's probably so infrequent and the
race so tiny that it never happened there, but the first bugchecks in
the sles VM (those bugchecks unfortunately removed when
mainline-merging) started to trigger only very recently when we started
zapping ptes and dropping pages from invalidate_inode_pages2 like
mainline. Bug was invisible in invalidate_mapping_pages (apparently only
jffs2 uses invalidate_mapping_pages in a way that could oops, even nfs
uses invalidate_inode_pages2).
