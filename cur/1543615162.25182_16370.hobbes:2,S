Er, what exactly is this against?  If this is just what's in the
linuxppc_2_4 tree against current 2.4.18pre, this is either (or will be
now :)) on BenH's list of things to resend to Marcelo, or there's a
problem with it still.  If you added in another patch, please re-send
this vs the linuxppc_2_4 tree.
