Well, I missed the initial part of this discussion. From your remark I
must conclude that the Windows box is dialling in to an ISP and it's a
Linux box that is somewhere on the net. Then you can't just put it in
the ppp0.options on the linux box. :-(
I do suspect that there must be a popup screen on W98 that allows you
this control. Possibly it's tucked away in some "registry" entry
somewhere.
