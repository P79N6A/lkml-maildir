I don't think there is a compelling case for us to use any efi
services at this time so unification should be easy:
rm arch/x86/kernel/efi_32.c arch/x86/kernel/efi_stub_32.c
Especially for accessing the real time clock that has a well
defined hardware interface going through efi an additional
software emulation layer looks like asking for trouble.
