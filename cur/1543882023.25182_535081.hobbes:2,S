I seriously hope you'll reconsider.  If you hadn't have done this,
things would have been a *lot* worse imo.
But either way, thanks for doing what remains a really grotty
job that may not get you as many kernel groupies as rewriting the
process scheduler, but is equally as (if not moreso) important.
