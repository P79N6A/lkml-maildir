No, if we're going to change anything, let's do it right.
Sure, you'll make this one check "portable", but the guts of the
main ifdef stuff for DAC support is still there.
I'd rather live with the hackish stuff temporarily, and get this all
cleaned up in one shot when we have a real DAC support API.
