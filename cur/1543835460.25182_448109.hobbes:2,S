No, ick, why would you want that?
Just look at the "dev" file in sysfs, which shows the major:minor
number.
Or just look at the directory that you are in, and that's almost always
the /dev node name.
For example, /sys/block/sda/sda1/ is /dev/sda1.
/sys/class/tty/ttyS1 is /dev/ttyS1.
It's usually not that difficult to do the mapping :)
