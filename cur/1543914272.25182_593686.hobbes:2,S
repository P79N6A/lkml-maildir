Do that for a handful of machines and it gets tiresome.

The 'proper' (though this is not an authoritative answer) way is to 
build the rpm the same way SUSE did. This ensures best compatibility and 
the fewest surprises. I am not saying it is easy, though.

Somewhat. The kernel rpm and 3rd party kernel module rpms share symbols 
so that upgrading will upgrade all the necessary things. (Instead of 
having to go through it all manually.)

It is not necessary. rpm -Uhv'ing the kernel-source rpm will repoint the
