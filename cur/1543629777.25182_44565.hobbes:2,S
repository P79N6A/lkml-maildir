So, basically you haven't tested this drive on any other kernels, right?
Let me guess, did you just get the drive at an Auction?
I'm burning on a scsi 4x and ide 16x with 2.4.19-pre6-vm33.
I have another scsi 12x that is having some trouble, and needs more testing,
so I may be able to help if I find a way to get that working.
