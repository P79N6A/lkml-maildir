Something like this, but "suspend" is not reserved as a name of specific state.
The second state is usually referred to as "suspend to RAM" or "STR" and is
denoted by "mem" in /sys/power/state, if implemented.  Moreover, "standby" and
"mem" are both entered using the same code path, so they may generally be
referred to as "suspend" states.
The times aren't strictly defined for "mem" and "standby", too.  The general
rule is that the times for "mem" are greater then for "standby" and the power
drawn in "mem" is smaller than the power drawn in "standby", but the exact
values will always depend on the platform.  Apart from this, if the platform
supports only one "suspend" state, it decides if that's "mem" or "standby".
On ACPI systems "standby" and "mem" correspond to the S1 and S3 sleep states,
respectively.
