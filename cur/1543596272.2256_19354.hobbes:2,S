The overall size of the circular buffer would have to be decreased
too, but that's more of a hack to fix it now; Which I guess is what it
comes to.

This is not really a problem; 16 bytes of hardware buffering I can
live with; at 19200 baud this is 7ms of lag.  The 4096 byte software
buffer causes 1706ms of lag; That *is* a problem.  It's a bit like the
difference between a hard disk drive's local buffer and the OS's (much
larger) buffering.  O_SYNC on a disk garuntees that the output has
been flushed to the disk, but maybe not the physical medium.  On a
serial port, similar functionality would be to have output to pushed
to the UART, but maybe not yet over the actual port.

The manpage seems to imply this would work, but it doesn't seem to
affect the software buffering at all (I tried this yesterday).  AFAICT
from looking at the driver, the low_latency mode only applies to
reading, not writing: tty_flip_buffer_push(tty) is the only place the
latency flag is ever checked, and that is only called in receive_chars
in serial.c.  The application that caused this doesn't get any serial
input whatsoever, so that won't (or at least shouldn't) get called.
I changed WAKEUP_CHARS to 1 rather than 256 (0 would cause processes
to hang forever, btw), and SERIAL_XMIT_SIZE to 16 rather than
PAGE_SIZE.  A proper solution would make this conditional on O_SYNC or
low_latency or even a kernel option.  Suggestions?
