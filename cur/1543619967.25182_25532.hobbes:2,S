I said in my previous mail that I use the 'woody' version so it should
be ready for 2.4.x kernel shouldn't it ?
Anymay, I had a look at A. Bunk site, upgraded the necessary packages
and reboot; well, still no problem for the 2.2.19 but still can't boot
the 2.4.x (tried the official kernel-image-2.4.17-k7)
any other idea ? thanks.
