Anton,
You're right. By defaut, the CONFIG_NR_CPUS is set to 32.
I need to reset that and rebuild the kernel to try the interrupt binding
again.
Thanks,

This is probably a ppc64 specific issue, we can continue this on
linuxppc64-dev@lists.linuxppc.org

Its part of the support for > 32way machines, but it looks like its
broken for some configurations (Im guessing you have CONFIG_NR_CPUS set
to 32).
