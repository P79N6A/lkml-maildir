Subject: [RFC] broken installkernel.sh with CROSS_COMPILE
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I noticed that my cross-compilation 'make install' broke with 2.6.13 (I
don't use it horribly often).  It's from this commit:
http://www.kernel.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=0f8e2d62fa04441cd12c08ce521e84e5bd3f8a46
Which added CROSS_COMPILE to each arch's install.sh:
if [ -x ~/bin/${CROSS_COMPILE}installkernel ]; then exec ~/bin/${CROSS_COMPILE}installkernel "$@"; fi
However, I don't just have a simple arch name as my CROSS_COMPILE, I
have a whole path, so that line expands like this for me:
+ '[' -x /home/dave/bin//home/services/cross_compile/ppc64/bin/ppc64-linux-gnu-installkernel ']'
Needless to say, that doesn't work :)
Could we do something that's guaranteed to not have lots of extra path
elements in it, like ARCH?  Something like this?
That way, people like me who have a single installkernel script that
does all of the fancy arch-detection can just do this:
	for i in `ls linux-2.6.git/arch/`; do 
		ln -s ~/bin/installkernel ~/bin/$i-installkernel
	fi
And be done with it forever.
