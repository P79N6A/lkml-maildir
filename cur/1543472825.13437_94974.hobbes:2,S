Sounds like Peters paper;

   This paper was first published in the Sixth USENIX Security Symposium
            Proceedings, San Jose, California, July 22-25, 1996
Abstract
   With the use of increasingly sophisticated encryption systems, an
   attacker wishing to gain access to sensitive data is forced to look
   elsewhere for information. One avenue of attack is the recovery of
   supposedly erased data from magnetic media or random-access memory.
   This paper covers some of the methods available to recover erased data
   and presents schemes to make this recovery significantly more
   difficult.
