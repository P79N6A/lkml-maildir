Actually, this is a documented feature :)
I had the same problem before finally finding the critical section of
the mount(8) man page:
              user   Allow an ordinary user  to  mount  the  file
                     system.   This  option  implies  the options
                     noexec, nosuid, and nodev (unless overridden
                     by subsequent options, as in the option line
                     user,exec,dev,suid).
Hence, in your fstab simply move the "exec" after the "user" option
and it will become active as the options are processed sequentially
and the user option is enforcing noexec.
(Took me a while to figure out what was wrong while trying to install
 a package from CD :)
