On my toshiba laptop, I am trying to use 2.2.19.
However, building it with the Toshiba Laptop option
set to Y or M results in errors.  The errors 
from setting it to M are:
toshiba.c:81: toshiba.h: No such file or directory
toshiba.c:156: parse error before `*'
...
The fix is to edit drivers/char/toshiba.c
and change 
	#include "toshiba.h"
to 
	#include"linux/toshiba.h"
Cheers,
