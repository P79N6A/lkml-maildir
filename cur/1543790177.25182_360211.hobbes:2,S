If the user signal handler decides to do something with it then it 
probably expects it to be 64-bit aligned as well per current ABI since 
those are 64 bit registers.

NO.  What I'm saying is that if ever the page is _not_ writable (be it 
absent or read-only) then do_DataAbort() is called just like if we had a 
real access fault as if we actually wrote to the page.  What happens at 
that point is therefore exactly the same as a real fault (either COW, 
paging from swap, process killed, or whatever).

Atomic operations are expected to be performed on an aligned word.  This 
code is only one way (and actually there might be only one person on the 
planet actually needing it at the moment) but all the other much common 
and faster ways would either succeed due to the alignment trap or fail 
due to the alignment trap (the alignment trap doesn't fix up misaligned 
accesses from ldrex/strex on ARMv6).  So in practice only RMK might be 
exercising that code.  If it becomes necessary for more configs then we 
could simply SIGBUS on a misaligned pointer.

This is IMHO way too much overkill for an operation that should be only 
a few assembly instructions in user space normally.  This really should 
remain as light weight as possible (and used only when there is 
absolutely no other ways).
