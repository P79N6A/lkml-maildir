Huh? The code that causes "event()" needs to get the CPU occasionally
to check for the event. The hardware doesn't produce an interrupt
upon that event.

The poll will almost never be true when first called. Spinning and
wasting CPU cycles that can be used by another task isn't a good
idea.
The hardware designer has designed the hardware according to
the requirements dictated by a government agency (the FDA).
There was no requirement to make interface code simple. The
interface code must check for multiple failure modes during
every specific operation. Both the hardware and software
check for these modes so that no single failure can cause
injury to a patient. This is SOP for medical equipment.
In the specific case, we operate a patient table. The operator
presses an UP and DOWN button. These will produce interrupts.
When an UP button is hit, thousands of interrupts are generated.
This is because it is a mechanical operation. The same is true
for the DOWN button. These events are filtered to determine
the true intervals for "UP", "NOTHING", and "DOWN". When the
"UP" button is pressed, the CPU servos position information
from another driver and motor speed to to move the table to
the commanded position. If the button is pressed for a short
period of time, the table moves slowly. If it is pressed for
a longer period, it moves quickly. It must accellerate according
to a schedule and decellerate according to a schedule so that
patients that weigh 350 lbs and patients that weigh 45 lbs are
accellerated and decellerated at the same rate.
When the table is being moved, 12 different parameters are
monitored. At least two parameters are actually calculated
and filtered to predict where the patient will be if the
button is released.
So, this cannot be dismissed as "get the hardware designer
to write the same driver..."
Writing software often requires knowing about the whole sustem.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
