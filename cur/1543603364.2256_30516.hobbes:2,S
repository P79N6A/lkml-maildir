I used it succesfully on a VAIO notebook (2.4.10 + ext3) and I had no
troubles. But I had that notebook only for a week, so I couldn't do any
extensible tests, the only thing I did, was cutting the power and seeing if
it recovers. and it did. fast and without problems.
but to the point of that thread. we had reiser FS on a production server
(Fileserver for NFS, Samba & Appletalk) and we nothing but troubles. It was
an 2.2.16 kernel and i dunno witch reiserfs we used. But from this point
forward I dun think I will use it again soon on a production server.
