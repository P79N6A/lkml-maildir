Yes, process would be stopped, and not *just* stopped but could spend
all his cpu time-slice in attempt to get spinlock (espec if set time is
much longer than read), but if we use mutex here the process could just
sleep instead of trying to get spinlock granted. Am I wrong? Or this is
not worth to do it?
