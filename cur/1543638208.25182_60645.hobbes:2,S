My board won't even POST with a tg3 card in it. With a newer BIOS it
passes the POST test and seems to work with the kernel fixups for the 
PCI bridges. There are also multiple people who had 3ware problems with
very fast machines, but I gather the latest driver merge fixed that.
So 2.4.9 I'd certainly expect to fail dismally. 2.4.18 ought to be ok as
should 2.4.19rc4. I run my board with an aacraid scsi and with netgear
ethernet and its stable.
