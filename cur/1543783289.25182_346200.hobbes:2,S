The kernel console is unlikely to ever going to have that - noone is
interested in changing the console subsystem.
The current state of input device support in the kernel, however, allows
any userspace program to access them independently, including keyboards.
That means multi-user X and possibly a userspace console implementation
(Jon Smirl is planning one) has no barriers in the kernel input device
implementation keeping it from proceeding.
The problems with multiple VGA cards, etc, are much harder to solve,
though.

Many people would like that. But not many enough to make it happen, at
least not until now.
