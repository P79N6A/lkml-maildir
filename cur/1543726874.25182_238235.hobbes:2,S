Yep they can, but if the SG list has been sized to fit after physically
merging then we have a problem when we later on want to split it. If the
architecture had more control over the merging process we could do a
better job here.

Think of it as a mapping from PCI to host memory, a window of at least
128MB and up to 3GB. You get to carve it up on a page granularity as you
like, we currently create 2 regions, a small allocation region and a
large one (above 15 pages).  The aim is to (hopefully) avoid
fragmentation in the large allocation region.

Removing the large allocation region should also fix our problems. I
should test that to verify its our problem.
