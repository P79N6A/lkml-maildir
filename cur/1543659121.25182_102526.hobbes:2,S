    linux refers to the kernel plus the GNU software, a complete os
    linux-kernel refers to the kernel (which is why this is the linux-kernel
    mailinglist not the linux mailinglist)
If this convention were general, it would be less confusing (though
still misleading and still unfair).  In practice, though references to
"Linux" can mean either one, and you can never tell which it is unless
you can guess from what is being said.
