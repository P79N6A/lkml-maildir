A streaming flag is great, but we usually do OK without it. There
is a "used once" heuristic that often gets it right as far as I
know. Basically, new pages that are only used once put almost zero
pressure on the rest of the memory.
It has a few corner cases where it breaks down. Hopefully they can
be improved...
