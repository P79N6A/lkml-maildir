After reading this, I enthousiastically upgraded from Xfree 4.2.0 to 
4.3.0, but nothing changed. :-( The problem is indeed X-related, but 
refuses to go away after the upgrade.
Also, I've had 4.2.0 and several earlier X versions working just fine
with the "old" matroxfb in the same setup that I'm using now. Was there 
a bug workaround for this issue in the old driver? If so, is there any
hope of it returning?
