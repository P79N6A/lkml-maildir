builtin_return_address(1) on i386 only works with stack frame pointers.
Without stack frame pointers, builtin_return_address(1) gets garbage.
builtin_return_address(0) is the only value that is guaranteed to work
with and without stack frame pointers.
Even with frame pointers, tail recursion confuses builtin_return_address(1)
on i386.
