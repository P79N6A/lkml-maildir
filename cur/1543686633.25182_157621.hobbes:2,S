That won't solve it - the key, while not repeating would be still
considered 'down' by the kernel and any more pressing of the key
wouldn't do anything.

Only for those with PS/2 keyboards. We still need the kernel repeat for
all other kinds of keyboards. And the impossibly fast repeat problem
actually needs solving elsewhere - it's a bad interaction betwen ACPI
and kernel timer, and that'll cause more trouble than just fast repeat.

My proposed solution is to do an input_report_key(pressed) immediately
followed by input_report_key(released) for these keys straight in
atkbd.c. Possibly based on some flag in the scancode->keycode table for
that scancode.
