Herbert,
Even with this patch I still see RCU breakage at these data rates and 
the problem persists -- it just takes
longer for it to manifest (about 23 hours).  I am recoding 
dev_queue_xmit since the use of RCU primitives
is severely busted.   I looked over the code and the fact it breaks on 
uniprocessor is really a joke. 
No offense guys, but this is pretty bad.  How about something simple, 
like a spinlock or
multiple send queues per proc?
Jeff
