As an "idea" it doesn't make much sense for me. An mm does tie up
considerable amounts of unswappable host memory (page tables, mm_struct), 
which could be used for a DoS without too many problems. The separation 
you are asking for just isn't there with UML. The same applies to other 
resources used by UML.
