Probably this was introduced a long time ago, so it's only recorded in
tglx's history git tree:
commit ccc875c1d2fe18b50020d501f1005ef46fc55fed

    [PATCH] Randomisation: stack randomisation
    The patch below replaces the existing 8Kb randomisation of the userspace sta
    pointer (which is currently only done for Hyperthreaded P-IVs) with a more
    general randomisation over a 64Kb range.  64Kb is not a lot, but it's a star
    and once the dust settles we can increase this value to a more agressive
    value.
