MSI is an edge trigger, which requires the synchronization handshake 
between the hardware device and its software device driver. For the 
MSI-X capability structure, the kernel handles the synchronization 
by masking and unmasking the MSI maskbits. For the MSI capability 
structure, the MSI maskbits is optional. If the e1000 hardware does not
support the MSI maskbits in its MSI capability structure, I guess it 
could be a race condition in e1000 hardware, which results an 
unpredictable behavior.
