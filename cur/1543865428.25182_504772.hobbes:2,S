So why do we have EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL then, if
  -  there shall be no enforcement (such as requiring modules to carry 
     exactly one MODULE_LICENSE, and it be GPL to access GPL symbols)
  -  EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL can be circumvented by having multiple 
     MODULE_LICENSE and one of those MODULE_LICENSE is ("GPL")
     [see Bodo's patch]
I think Linus has made a stance on the purpose of _GPL [yup, 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2003/12/4/84
 ], and I interpret his words "if you 
need this export, you're clearly doing something that requires the GPL" 
being in conflict with [X].
[X]: """obj-combo += proprietary.o gpldummy.o""" and allowing 
proprietary.c to use GPL symbols just because the combo.ko file contains 
at least one MODULE_LICENSE("GPL").
Note IANAL, more a developer, so please don't flame too much.
Jan
