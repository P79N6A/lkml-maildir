As part of my testing of the fastwalk patch I ported the lockmeter
patch that John Hawkes wrote to 2.4.21-rc8. This patch now applied
cleanly, there were minimal merge conflicts I fixed for the i386 arch.
This allows you to see which functions are contending for which locks,
among other great things.
