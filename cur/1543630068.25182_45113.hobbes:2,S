    Hi Denis :)
    Thanks for answering :)

    This is the problem.

    And is corrected just by inverting the two quoted code snips :)
    If we test for len being greater than TASK_SIZE *before* aligning
it then the function works properly (the alignment will be done
properly in the task address space). No patch needed really ;)

    I'll give a try to the inversion, that should work. I have
written a small stress program for mmap, so in a few hours the patch
will be ready. Must I post it here or send it directly to Marcello?

    Ok :) I'll prepare the patch right now. Unified diff?
>BTW, does anybody know why len==0 is not flagged as error?
    Well, I suppose that if you request 0 bytes, any address returned
is valid, since it cannot be accessed (SIGSEGV...). Anyway the man
page for mmap() clearly says that the address returned is NEVER 0, so
we must test for len==0 and invert the other tests.
    Thanks a lot for answering, I was supposing that anybody on the
list was ignoring this obvious and easy to correct bug :?
