I do not know how to sync it up. This header linux/taskstats.h is
meant to be included by userspace programs. If an application
happens to include linux/sched.h, which includes linux/time.h,
the application will very likely have compilation errors because
the "struct timespec" declaration in <linux/time.h> and <time.h>
are conflicting.
The <linux/acct.h> defines it to
#define ACCT_COMM    16
I can change our define to TS_COMM_LEN with remakes saying it
should be in sync with the TAKS_COMM_LEN defined in linux/sched.h.
If there is a better way, i am eager to know it.

Will fix it.

It must be inherited from old code dated back to Cray UNICOS.
I do not know if bad thing can happen if both utime and stime
are less than 1 usec...  I guess not. But i agree that
half a tick does not make sense. To play safe, we can change
it to 1 usec if both utime and stime are sub microsecond.
What do you think?
