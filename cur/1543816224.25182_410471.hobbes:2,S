A semantic cleanup remains a cleanup.

Huh?  I've yet to see kswapd non-interactive.  If I do, I'll have
grounds to party, because the box would otherwise have been a doorstop.

They don't need to be treated special, and it is flat wrong to do so.
Try the patch set and you'll see that they continue to work just fine.
Consider this:  why should 10 copies of knfsd have any more right than
10 copies of apache to utterly monopolize my cpu?  Fact is, there is no
difference.  Both are acting on behalf other user tasks.  The fact that
one is a kernel thread means nothing.

Throttling changes this.  Believe it or not, I didn't just run around

It achieves precisely what the comment you placed there some odd years
ago says it should achieve.  Thud is a pure cpu hog that sleeps for a
while to charge it's battery for an intentional attack.  It was written
specifically to demonstrate the problem with allowing a long sleep to
rocket you to the top of the world as stock code does.  Try running the
stock kernel with irman2 and thud running, then you'll certainly
understand what this change achieves.

Why should it degenerate?  You express your concerns, I answer them.
You don't have to agree with me, and I don't have to agree with you.
That's no reason for the discussion to degenerate.
