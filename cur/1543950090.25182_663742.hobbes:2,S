Subject: [PATCH 0/2] Cpuset hardwall flag:  Introduction

Currently the cpusets mem_exclusive flag is overloaded to mean both
"no-overlapping" and "no GFP_KERNEL allocations outside this cpuset".
These patches add a new mem_hardwall flag with just the allocation
restriction part of the mem_exclusive semantics, without breaking
backwards-compatibility for those who continue to use just
mem_exclusive. Additionally, the cgroup control file registration for
cpusets is cleaned up to reduce boilerplate.
