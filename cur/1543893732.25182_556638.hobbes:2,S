It looks like the ATA passthru commands contain more information than
what libata needs to execute a command.
e.g. protocol number:
     libata could possibly infer the protocol from the command opcode.
e.g. multi_count:
     libata caches dev->multi_count. Passing multi_count along with
     each passthru command looks useless for libata.     
e.g. t_dir:
     libata could possible infer the direction from the command opcode
     or from the protocol number (e.g. 4: PIO_IN / 5: PIO_OUT).
Due to the redundant info, there is possiblely inconsistency between
the parameters. e.g. t_dir vs protocol. e.g. command vs protocol.
It seems the "redundant" parameters are designed to allow stateless SATL
implementation: The application/passthru command tells the stateless SATL
implementation the protocol and the multi_count, etc. Then SATL just
follows the instruction blindly, even if asked to do something stupid.
Currently libata
 - uses the passthru protocol number blindly
   (even if the application issues a DMA command with wrong PIO protocol.)
 - checks and warns about multi_count
 - ignores t_dir, byte_block and so on.
Maybe we need a strategy to deal with incorrect passed-thru commands?
say,
 - check and reject if something wrong
 - mimimal check and warn/ignore, if it doesn't hurt command execution
