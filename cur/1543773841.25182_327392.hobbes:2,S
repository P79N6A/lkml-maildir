I think the concern here is that this is implemented at the wrong level.
In Linux, a filesystem is some dumb thing which implements
address_space_operations, filesystem_operations, etc.
Advanced features such as those which you describe are implemented on top
of the filesystem, not within it.  reiser4 turns it all upside down.
Now, some of the features which you envision are not amenable to
above-the-fs implementations.  But some will be, and that's where we should
implement those.
