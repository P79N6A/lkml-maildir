ptrace is for debugging user space, as for example is oprofile. kprobes

Sounds like a kprobes clone 8).

Oprofile lets you work on stuff like cache affinity, tuning array walks
and prefetches. Short of running the app under cachegrind its one of the
most detailed ways of getting all the profile register data from the x86
processors.

Standard debugging tools. The system dumps across the network to a
server and then you can analyse it offline

You clearly haven't understood what Oprofile does. Its a parallel
technology that is more in common with say Intel's vtune.
