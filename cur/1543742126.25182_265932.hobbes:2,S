Hi Chris,
I've tried the patch but it failed to apply. By the looks of the code 
the patch was already applied. It looks like a new issue :-(
Line 759 and on look like this
#if defined(PG_skipped)
        ClearPageSkipped(page);
#endif
        if (page->mapping != NULL)
                delete_from_page_cache(page);
        unlock_page(page);
}
Cheers,
Stef
