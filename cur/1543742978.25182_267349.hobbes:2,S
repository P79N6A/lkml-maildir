It is certain that the freebox run linux on mips processor [0] :
see the cv of the developper of the freebox [1] [2]
They seem to have done minor contribution [3]
It seem [4] that linux is writen on a flash memory of the freebox with the
firmware of the ADSL modem (if it wasn't how the freebox could connect
throught ADSL for download root and new firmware).
Also it is said that  if you forgot to give
back to them you paid about 300 ??? and it is yours.
I don't know if there is a real GPL violation, but knowing the free support
it will be very difficult to communicate with them...
