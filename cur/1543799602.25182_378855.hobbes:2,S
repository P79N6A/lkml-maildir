Subject: [PATCH] fix posix lock on NFS, #2

Hi,
This is another problem report on posix lock.
The nfsd may handle the lock information incorrectly if new lock is
contiguous to old one.  I think both 2.6 and 2.4 kernel have this bug.
The following is a sample program to produce the circumstance.
        fd = open("file_on_nfs_2", O_RDWR | O_CREAT, 0644);
        memset(&lck, 0, sizeof(lck));
        lck.l_type = F_WRLCK;
        switch (child = fork()) {
        case 0:
                lck.l_start = 0; lck.l_len = 1; fcntl(fd, F_SETLK, &lck);
                sleep(1);
                lck.l_start = 1; lck.l_len = 1; fcntl(fd, F_SETLKW, &lck);
                _exit(0);
        default:
                lck.l_start = 1; lck.l_len = 1; fcntl(fd, F_SETLK, &lck);
                sleep(2); close(fd);
                printf("waiting...\n");
                // sleep(1); kill(chiled, SIGINT);
                wait(NULL);
                break;
        }
All version of linux requires time to grant the lock, but on older
kernel the lock is leaked if it is signaled while waiting the grant.
I think it is caused by a miss-calling of posix_lock_file() in nfsd.
posix_lock_file() updates the second argument `request' as you know,
but it seems that nfsd gives no care about that.
Here is a patch.  It changes nfsd to keep the range of file_lock for
later use.  Any comments and feedback are welcome.
