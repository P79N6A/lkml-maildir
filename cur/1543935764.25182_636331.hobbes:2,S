Hmmmm...  I can't see how to add a new security class.  I can see that
security classes are defined in various autogenerated header files, but
autogenerated from what?  The "This file is automatically generated.  Do not
edit." message at the top of these files seems to belie the fact they're
actually checked in to GIT as is.
