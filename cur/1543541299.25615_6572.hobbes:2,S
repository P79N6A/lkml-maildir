Not quite related to kernel development per see, but I though,
nevertheless it would be of interest to many folks here.

Subject: machine independent protection from stack-smashing attack
I have been investigating a machine-independent change to GCC that
would generate code to protect applications from stack-smashing attacks.
The main characteristics are low performance overhead of the protection
code, protecting against different varieties of stack-smashing attacks,
and supporting various processors. A research report is ready on
the web (
http://www.trl.ibm.co.jp/projects/security/propolice
).
I would like some feedback whether it is worth pursuing getting it
assigned to the FSF for inclusion in GCC.
