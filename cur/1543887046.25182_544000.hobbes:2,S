Please quote W3C's entire definition of their notion of obsolete:
"An obsolete element or attribute is one for which there is no guarantee
of support by a user agent. Obsolete elements are no longer defined in
the specification, but are listed for historical purposes in the changes
section of the reference manual."

If you apply W3C's term "obsolete" 1:1 to kernel features, then it would
read:
"An obsolete feature is one for which there is no guarantee of support
by a randomly picked kernel release. Obsolete features are no longer
implemented in this release, but are listed for historical purposes in
Documentation/ABI/removed/."
Except that the term "obsolete" is already used differently in the
context of Linux kernel features; see Documentation/ABI/README.
Also, you say "the official definitions of those terms" were defined at
http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/conform.html.
  That's not quite true.  What
you find there are the definitions of those terms as used in the HTML 4
specification.  Nothing more.
