Just to clarify -The allocation failure currently happens only on x86_64 - 
on i386 it uses alloc_bootmem and does not fail.
Regardless though this patch is a good idea for both i386 and x86_64 - 
there is no point in repeatedly allocating memory for large empty strings 
no matter where it comes from, which was the point of this patch.

So looks like currently we have to at least use 4K with these patches - 
that would be at least 8 times more than what is actually used after this 
patch unless we also fit in some other early alloc in this 4k. I will keep 
an eye on the ff tree though - when you get to fix it we can switch all early allocs to use it.
