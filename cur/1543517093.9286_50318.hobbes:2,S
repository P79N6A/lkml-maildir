Hi everybody,
I am trying to understand the purpose of struct dst_entry *dst
in struct sk_buff.
Also,when the ip_rcv() calls the ip_route_input(),is the routing 
decision made at that point and stored in dst_entry.
Can anybody help me out.
Any good links to the documentation of the kernel data structures related 
to networking would be of great help.
bye,
prakash
