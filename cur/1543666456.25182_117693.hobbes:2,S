Good, it lets us optimize for 1/32/64/lots of cpus.  NR_CPUS > 8 *
sizeof(unsigned long) is the interesting case, it needs arrays.

That definitely needs encapsulation to handle cpus_allowed etc. being
arrays.  A function to generate the logical and of p->cpus_allowed and
cpu_online_map and return cpumask_t * is easy.  Doing ffs on that
result will not work, it assumes NR_CPUS fits in a word.  Add
ffs_cpumask(cpumask_t *).
