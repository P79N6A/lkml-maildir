In both cases, should I free the sk_buff structure or only if I return 0?
Also, if I understand you correctly, I should _only_ call netif_stop_queue()
if the function fails to transmit the packet?
What about cases where the packet will always fail, e.g. the frame length is
bigger than what the device supports. I take it in those cases I should
return 0, but should I call netif_stop_queue() as well?
