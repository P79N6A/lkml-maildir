If that's what you want to accomplish, then you can easily get around
that in several ways.
1. Simply   $ cat tooltip.js banner.js foo.js > code.js  then include
code.js in your html document and remember to update it when you
change one of the 3 files (or create a script that does it.
2. use Apache's mod_include
3. Use PHP, Perl, python or watever your scripting language of choice
is - here's an example in PHP :
<?php
header('Content-type: text/javascript');
readfile('tooltip.js');
readfile('banner.js');
readfile('foo.js');
?>
save that as javascripts.php then put this in your HTML document :
<script src="javascripts.php" language="javascript"
type="text/javascript"></script>
And there are other ways ...

Negligible I'd say.

Might be a cute little hack, but I don't think it's a very useful
feature really..
