I have exactly the same problem and the "hack" didn't work for me either. See
the other thread I've started on this topic! Anyway... I dunno what to do...
I've tried the hack and I can't boot so I'm running the driver as is... I've
mailed the author and I didn't get any bounces... hopefully we'll see some
response tomorrow after the US is back to work from holiday!
Note: the problem still exists in the 2.2.12 kernel... I've now encountered it
in 2.2.5-15, 2.2.5-22, and 2.2.12. From my reading of the sources it's been
quite a while since anybody touched that driver!
