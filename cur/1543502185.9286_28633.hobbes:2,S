IA32 should also use HZ=1000. However, the API (now cast in stone)
specifies that HZ == 100 when seen from userland. Linus has suggested
that the kernel-HZ need not be the same as what is "published" to the
user applications.
I've entered a project into cosource, which suggests to do this. So if
you want short-sleeps done right, you can go over there when it goes
open for the public (*), and put some dollars on it. Someone is bound
to want to go grab the few hundred dollars when the total comes to
that amount. I'd consider it "work" if I'd get about a thousand
dollars, but I expect that many others will beat that price.
