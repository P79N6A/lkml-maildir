Hi!
Recently I have upgraded my kernel from 2.4.22-AlanCoxPatch. I have an
Acer Travelmate 290LMi laptop (Centrino). All worked well with 2.4.22
but i have problems with new kernels.
With 2.4.25 + cpufreq patch from
ftp://ftp.linux.org.uk/pub/linux/cpufreq/
 and a few minutes after boot
(when i try to know battery state with acpi command) i get this "bucle"
error:
Feb 24 23:47:00 localhost kernel: acpi_battery-0195 [1619]
acpi_battery_get_statu: Error evaluating _BST
Feb 24 23:47:01 localhost kernel:  dswload-0279: *** Error: Looking up
[PBST] in namespace, AE_ALREADY_EXISTS
Feb 24 23:47:01 localhost kernel:  psparse-0588 [1626]
ps_parse_loop         : During name lookup/catalog, AE_ALREADY_EXISTS
Feb 24 23:47:01 localhost kernel:  psparse-1120: *** Error: Method
execution failed [\_SB_.PCI0.LPC0.BAT1._BST] (Node c1562528),
AE_ALREADY_EXISTS
I tried with 2.6.3 and y get the same error :-( 
I have twho friends with diferents laptops who have the same problem.
Thank for your help.
