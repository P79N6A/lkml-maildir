Oh, one more thing. After removed the superflurous switch statement flags 
will have a value which fixes the warning.
If you look at the flow of code it is impossible for flags to not have a 
value when it gets to the if statement as the previous switch statement 
would give it a value. But since that switch statement only catches that 
one case anyway, it's better to merge the 2 switch statemnets.
