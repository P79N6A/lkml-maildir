i've had decent results (excellent performance, occasional light glitches)
with the broadcom 1000bt copper ethernet cards, in both server and
workstation use. the only problems i've had with them are related to
trying to use them with fixed-speed ports attached to cisco switches. if
you put em all in a rack with a nice GB switch, they kick butt.
