For what it's worth, it compiled cleanly on Linux 2.2.3-ac2+OPLbeep using
glibc 2.1 libraries/headers.   Though, as with the other BIND 8.2
snapshots, I did have to add a couple of #defines to 
/src/port/linux/include/port_after.h  --  namely:
#define HAS_INET6_STRUCTS 1
#define fds_bits __fds_bits
