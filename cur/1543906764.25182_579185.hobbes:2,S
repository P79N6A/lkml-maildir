For x86-64 most distribution kernels are NUMA these days.

How do you get to 7k? We got worst case 3 zones node (normally less);
that's three pointers per GFP level.

That might be a good tradeoff, but without seeing the patch 
the 7k number sounds very dubious.

Or disable ZONE_MOVABLE. It seems to be clearly not well thought
out well yet. Perhaps make it dependent on !CONFIG_NUMA.
