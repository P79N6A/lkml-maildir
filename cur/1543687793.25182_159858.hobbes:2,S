Hi guys!
Is there any night builds farm for Linux project?
As far as I know many sw companies (even ms) have such. It greatly help to 
hunt and collect BUGs.
I think it is very easy to write apropriate scripts (or software) to do 
regular builds and testing.
Correct me if I am wrong - most of  the bug-reports are from 
geeks/sysadmins/developers.
Why not to use automation provided by computers?
If my idea is bad (or discussed earlier) just skip it.

Pretty fine running 2.6-test4.
