Yes that's the proper place to do this. The generic elevator on a
*single* queue
makes not much sense. Once ago I have just disabled it entierly and on a
system with swap on a separate disk and controller this was a
performance *win*.
Some of the FS code in esp. the ISO9660 does even under linux something
*very*
much like this. Many of the prop. cd-rom device drivers are basically
emulating 512k block devices by reading ahead and throwing away data.
There is really plenty of room for improvement here.
