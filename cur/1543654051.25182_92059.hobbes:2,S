Ah, thanks, good catch.  I changed it to "This prevents you".

No, it doesn't.  The question is badly phrased.  How about:
Q: But the modules' init routine calls my register() routine which
   wants to call back into one of the function pointers immediately,
   and so try_module_get() fails! (because the module is not finished
   initializing yet)
A: You're being called from the module, so someone already has a
   reference (unless there's a bug), so you don't need a
   try_module_get().
   This does mean that if you were to register a structure for
   *another* module (does anyone do this?) you'd need to have a
   reference to it.

Heh.
Well, if we continue to start modules unisolated, I need to rewrite
the FAQ anyway...
Thanks,
Rusty.
