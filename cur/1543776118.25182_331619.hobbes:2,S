Subject: [patch 2.6.13-rc2] yet another fix for setup-bus.c/x86 merge
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

There is a slight disagreement between setup-bus.c code and traditional
x86 PCI setup wrt which recourses are invalid vs resources that are
free for further allocations.
Precisely, in the setup-bus.c, if we failed to allocate some resource,
we nullify "start" and "flags" fields, but *not* the "end" one.
But x86 pcibios_enable_resources() does the following check:
if (!r->start && r->end) {
	printk(KERN_ERR "PCI: Device %s not available because of resource collisions\n", pci_name(dev));
	return -EINVAL;
which means that the device owning the offending resource cannot be
enabled.
In particular, this breaks cardbus behind the normal decode p2p bridge -
the cardbus code from setup-bus.c requests rather large IO and MEM windows,
and if it fails, the socket is completely unavailable. Which is wrong, as
the yenta code is capable to allocate smaller windows.
