First off, nice idea, but I think the implementation needs a bit of
work.

Ick, don't put help files within the kernel image.  Didn't you take them
all out for the edd patch a while ago?  :)
Just make it a write only file.

Why wouldn't the writing to the new_id file cause the probe to happen
immediatly?  Why wait?  So I think we can get rid of that file.
Also, do we really need to keep a list of id's visible to userspace (the
"0" file above?  We currently don't do that for the "static ids" (yeah I
know they are easily extracted from the module image...)

Why would a driver want to override these behaviors?

Is that the exists() callback?  Is it really needed?  Can't the pci core
do this without needing to push that logic into the driver core?  After
all, it knows if the pci_driver->probe() call is non-NULL, the driver
core doesn't.
Also, we really need a generic way to easily create subdirectories
within the driver model, to keep you from having to dive down into
kobjects and the mess, like you had to do here.  Pat's said he will work
on this next, once he emerges from his OLS paper writing hole, and
there's even a bug assigned to him for this:
	
http://bugme.osdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=650
Once that is in, this patch should clean up a whole lot.  I'd recommend
waiting for that (or if you want to tackle it, please do) before
applying something like your patch.
Sound ok?
thanks,
greg k-h
