Subject: TPM driver changes to support multiple locality

Current TPM driver supports only locality 0. I am planning to add
support so that it can access any locality. Locality parameter will be
passed as parameter. Will this change be acceptable? If yes then I will
modify the driver and send the patch.
Thanks,
Lomesh
