The web page that you mentioned is now at
  
http://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~vojtech/input/
or
  
http://linuxconsole.sourceforge.net/input/input.html
However, the parkbd reference isn't there.
Google for "parkbd +adapter" and you can find it.
parkbd adapter is mentioned here
  <
http://linuxconsole.sourceforge.net/input/adapters.html>
but not presented...
