The PCI specs are fine. You just have to read them several dozen of times 
in order to understand most of them. :)
And indeed, real PCI chipsets most of the time donnot follow exactly the
official PCI ordering rules. Probably, designers of bridges haven't had
time to read the specs times enough. ;)

Facing posted writes and ordering rules that occur in a system, nothing is
simple.

Why?
Writing and maintaining drivers, having to solve weird problems is great 
fun. And you have to learn lots of things if you want to have some chance 
to understand what actually happens.
People that really like IOs or some kind of IOs will work on drivers, 
in my opinion.
Even for CPU only concern when dealing with SMP, you also have to be 
careful about consistency issues. A device driver that deals with 
a sophisticated device is just kind of AMP (A=asymetric) and you only 
have a weak handle on ordering; this is the funniest thing.

Existing bridges intentionnal misdesigns (compared to official
specifications) can easily be categorized. Perhaps there are not too many
ways to make things wrong ;). It also appears that misbehaviours due to
Errata (unintentionnal) are often due to similar mistakes, probably since 
engineers have failed the same way facing the same difficulties.
This let me think that it should be possible to support existing stuff 
without needing too much help from E.T. :)

If a read in one direction does not flush posted writes to the same
direction then nothing reliable can be achieved.
The ideal situation is what the PCI spec says about transaction ordering.
Basically (from memory):
- Strong ordering in each direction.
- A read must complete at its destination after all posted writes to the 
  same direction have completed and must complete at the originator after
  all posted writes in the opposite direction have completed.
- The design of the whole PCI system must ensure that no deadlock or
  livelock may occur.
- The interrupt mechanism must not be used to synchronize transactions.
- Etc...
But the reality is quite different:
Some system-PCI bridges may:
- Reorder write to memory.
- Only flush on a read posted write transactions that go in the
  direction of this read transaction (donnot flush PWs in the opposite 
  direction)
- Only ensure that everything is flushed prior to the interrupt delivery.
- Not snoop DMA accesses.
- Etc...
There is no nightmare here, but just too much fun. ;-)
