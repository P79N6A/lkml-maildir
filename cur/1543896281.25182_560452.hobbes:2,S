Subject: [PATCH] driver core: multithreaded probing - more parallelism control
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
This is a new version of multithreaded probing patch, with more
parallelism control added.
There are more control over which devices and drivers will be probed
parallelized or serially. For example, in IEEE1394 subsystem, the
different "units" in one "node" can be probed serially while the
different "nodes" can be probed parallelized.
The number of threads can be controlled through a kernel command line
parameters.
The patch is against 2.6.22-rc5. The "wait_for_probes" function in the
patch comes from the original multithreaded probing patch. If I need do
anything because of it, please let me know.
Any comment is welcome.
Best Regards,
Huang Ying

This patch add multithreaded probing with more parallelism control.
The device/driver probing is done on a probing queue, which is a
customized version of work queue, where the thread of probing queue will
come and go on demand. There is a queue No. for each probing queue. The
queue No. ranges from 0 to (unsigned short) ~0U, any queue No. can be
used by probing independent of the underlying thread number.
The device/driver probing is submitted to a probing queue though
"schedule_probe" function with probing queue No, a probing function and
corresponding parameter specified. The probing with same probing queue
No. will be done serially, while the probing with different probing
queue No. may be done parallelized.
"schedule_probe" is a general interface of multithreaded probing. While
convenient interfaces are as follow.
A field named "probe_queue_no" is added to "struct device", which
indicates probing queue No. on which the probing of the device will be
done. The subsystem can control the parallelism through this field. For
example, in IEEE1394 subsystems, the same probe_queue_no can be assigned
for different "units" in same "node" while different probe_queue_no can
be assigned to different "nodes".
Fields named "has_probe_queue" and "probe_queue_no" are added to "struct
device_driver". This let the probing queue can be controlled through
driver side too. If "has_probe_queue" is set, the "probe_queue_no" of
"struct device_driver" is used, otherwise that of "struct device" is
used.
There are other rules to control the parallelism.
1. The child device will not start probing until the probing of its
parent has been done.
2. The different drivers of same device will be probed serially.
If it is intended to separate the probing process of the device/driver
into synchronous part and asynchronous part, the ".probe" of "struct
device_driver" is used as the synchronous interface of device probing,
while the asynchronous part of probing can be submitted through
"schedule_probe" in ".probe" function. All the synchronous part will be
submitted with same probing queue number.
More strict serialization can be gotten through this mechanism if
needed. For example, if two USB driver is inserted into kernel
simultaneously, in original driver probing code, two USB device may be
probed simultaneously, while they will be probed serially if two device
has same probing queue No. in probing queue based probing code.
There is a problem of this multithreaded probing mechanism. There are
some code in kernel doing hardware access but not in the driver ".probe"
function, which may conflict with the multithreaded probiMore strict
serialization can be gotten through this mechanism if
needed. For example, if two USB driver is inserted into kernel
simultaneously, in original driver probing code, two USB device may be
probed simultaneously, while they will be probed serially if two device
has same probing queue No. in probing queue based probing code.
There is a problem of this multithreaded probing mechanism. There are
some code in kernel doing hardware access but not in the driver ".probe"
function, which may conflict with the multithreaded probing driver code.
A possible mechanism is executing those hardware access code in a
probing queue through "schedule_probe".ng driver code. A possible
mechanism is executing those hardware access code in a probing queue
through "schedule_probe".
