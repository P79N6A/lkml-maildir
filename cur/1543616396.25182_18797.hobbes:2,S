Would ordering rules help answer that?  If you write two separate
loads you have two separate side effects that are ordered in time,
while for a single big load they occur concurrently.  If the construct
where those two loads occur does not allow for side effects to be
interleaved, then the "as if" principle seems to say you cannot
legally merge the loads.
