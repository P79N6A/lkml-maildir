This says yes:
main()
{
	unsigned long long ll = 0xffffffffffffffff;
	if (ll == -1)
		printf("yes\n");
}
The compiler has ((int)-1) and then has to promote it to ULL.  If it does
the conversion to unsigned before the conversion to long long, we lose. 
But it doesn't, and I couldn't immediately find a spec which justfies this
behaviour.
