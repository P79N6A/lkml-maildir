An update on this.
After numerous experiments, I now suspect some code in userland. I managed to 
find the traceback involved in the storm and every packet generated in the storm 
repeats the whole of the patern:
...
tg3_start_xmit
qdisc_restart
dev_queue_xmit
ip_finish_output2
ip_build_xmit
udp_sendmsg
inet_sendmsg
sock_sendmsg
sys_sendto
sys_socketcall
...
This is a MOUNT req, not NFS, so we are using userland rpc?
Now, just as a conformation, if I put a delay in sys_socketcall after each group 
of 40 packets sent, my storm recovers after 40 packets!
I was sidetracked by my ignorance of the fact that the MOUNT call does not go 
through the kernel module nfs/sunrpc, which made me go off instrumenting, 
debugging and tracing those modules that do not even get used :-((((((((!
