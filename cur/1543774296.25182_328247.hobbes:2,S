Use the built-in kernel functions, don't create a new one and go around
the _GPL export.

Have the Makefile define this for you, it's not needed in the .c file

Why a separate subdirectory?  It should just go in include/linux/ like
everything else.

dev == NULL instead of the other way around (yes, I know why you do
this, but the rest of the kernel is the other way, and gcc will warn you
if you forget a '=').

Ick, that's a horrible way to define things.  Please make it look like
real .c code.

No spaces in driver names please.

Cast is unnecessary.
Also, get rid of all typedefs, they are not acceptable.

Don't put #ifdef in code where it is not needed at all.

Extra { } are not needed.
What is this checking for anyway?
Use dev_err() for these things.

#ifdef not nice to have here, it's not needed.

Just use the raw error number, don't redefine it.

Why not use the device.bus_id instead?
I too would like to see how this code is used, example drivers please.
