I think that will do the wrong thing between 23 and 47 days uptime because
time_after() will return an incorrect answer.
How's this look?
- Bump the timeout to 30 seconds - 9600 baud is slow.
- Handle jiffy wraps: change the logic so that we only skip the lockbust if
  the current time is within 30 seconds of the previous lockbusting attempt.
