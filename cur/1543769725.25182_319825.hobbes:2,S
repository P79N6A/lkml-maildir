Very true.  FUSE currently handles it by allowing SIGKILL, but no
other signals.  Interrupting file operations would be very nice, but
unfortunately apps just don't handle it very well (even in case SuS
actually allows EINTR).

Then why the hack do people write programs that get some alarm signal
100 times a second _while_ doing the open.  If they do that then
trying to make it interruptible is sort of useless.
