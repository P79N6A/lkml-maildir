As a last resort there is always the option to encrypt everything.
Of course you loose the LABEL & UUID support with that.
But i circumvented that by a custom udev script and marking the MBR in 
the documented 4 bytes for an ID that is used by said script to create 
an appropriate symlink.
Together with a matching autofs-conf i can still automatically mount all 
my >50 encrypted HDDs i have stacked on my shelf. :-)

Real Programmers consider "what you see is what you get" to be just as 
bad a concept in Text Editors as it is in women. No, the Real Programmer
wants a "you asked for it, you got it" text editor -- complicated, 
cryptic, powerful, unforgiving, dangerous.
