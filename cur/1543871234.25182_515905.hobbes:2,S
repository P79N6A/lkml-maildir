OK, let's say we have a 4k pagesize and a 1k fs blocksize and someone does
ftruncate(fd, 1024 + 100).
We need to:
- load bytes (0 ...  1024+100) from disk (these are live file data)
- zero the bytes (1024+100 ...  1024+1024) (these are data outside the
  truncation point, but inside the fs block which straddles the truncation
  point)
- zero the bytes (1024+1024 ...  4096) (these are the rest of the
  pagecache page, outside the truncation point).
- mark the page dirty so those zeroes outside the truncation point but
  inside the block which straddles i_size (ie: (1024+100 ...  1024+1024)
  get written back.
Now, it just so happens that
	nobh_prepare_write(NULL, page, 1024+100, 1024+1024)
will indeed load bytes (0 ...  1024+1024) from disk, and will then zero out
bytes (1024+100 ...  4096) for us (I think - assumes that ->get_block does
the right thing with buffer_mapped)).  We could exploit that knowledge of
prepare_write() internals in nobh_truncate_page().
But as it stands, nobh_truncate_page() is being formal and is not making
assumptions about what nobh_prepare_write() does with blocks outside
i_size.
