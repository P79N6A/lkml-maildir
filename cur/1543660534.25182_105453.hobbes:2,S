... but all the threads' cachelines will collide, whereas if
you're using nonblocking I/O, session state might be staggered better.
This is just a guess; I haven't measured it.

What syscall?  You call sys_epoll once for every thousand events or so,
then you call your handler, which does a write or whatever.  No
extra syscall.

I agree that for 700 clients the answer may be different than for 2000 clients.
However, if you have to handle 700 clients, how do you know you won't
have to handle 2000 later?
In any case, benchmarking's the only way to go.  No amount of talk will
substitute for a good real-life measurement.  That's what convinced
me that epoll was faster than sigio, and that sigio was
sometimes slower than select() !
And, for what it's worth, programmer productivity is sometimes
more important than all the above.  I happen to work
at a place where performance is worth a lot of extra effort,
but other shops prefer to throw hardware at the problem and
not worry about that last 10%.
