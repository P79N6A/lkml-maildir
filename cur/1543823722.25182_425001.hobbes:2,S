Thanks. This updated one fixes that and clears up the remaining mystery of
why the ceiling is the size it is in the comments.
---
The relationship between INTERACTIVE_SLEEP and the ceiling is not perfect
and not explicit enough. The sleep boost is not supposed to be any larger
than without this code and the comment is not clear enough about what exactly
it does, just the reason it does it.
There is a ceiling to the priority beyond which tasks that only ever sleep
for very long periods cannot surpass.
Opportunity to micro-optimise and re-use the ceiling variable.
