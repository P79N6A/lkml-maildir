setserial /dev/ttyS2 port 0x200 irq 5 autoconfig
and you might then end up with another serial port detected.  If
/dev/ttyS2 and above do not exist, you can't do that.  That would
in turn effectively prevent folk with some serial cards using them
with Linux without editing and rebuilding their kernel.
As for the rest of the "setserial stuff" it gets recorded against
the port and remembered for when the hardware turns up, which it
may do if it's your PCMCIA modem card.
