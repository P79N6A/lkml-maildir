i still disagree. We should be /a lot/ more careful in adding patches 
that change platform behavior.
i happen to run a distro kernel, and in fact i'm maintaining the -rt yum 
repository which offers a distro kernel and which also tracks mainline 
very closely.
i agree with you that Calgary support, if it was enabled (which it is in 
my config), would run through the calgary_detect() function. The 
breakage was not caused by the default-y patch, it was caused by the 
other patch preceding it:

   [PATCH] Calgary: use BIOS supplied BBARs and topology information
I think in the future it would be better to annotate the introduction of 
new, widely used codepaths via KERN_DEBUG printouts, something along the 
lines of:
	printk(KERN_DEBUG "calgary: running new EBDA code.\n");
	...
	printk(KERN_DEBUG "calgary: done.\n");
That way "debug ignore_loglevel console=tty" bootopions would have 
uncovered the source of this hang. Just like i can use the 
initcall_debug boot option to figure out where the bootup hangs.
but i still /strongly/ disagree with your attitude that mainline is 
'experimental' and hence there's nothing to see here, move over.

there's really no need to apologize, i probably broke your box a few 
orders of magnitude more times than you broke mine ;)
Nevertheless my point is that we /have/ to be more supportive of early 
adopter distro kernels (Dave Jones says that the same bug has hit Fedora 
rawhide too), and have to be doubly careful about anything that goes 
into code that is run by /everyone/. Especially if it's in a hard to 
debug place like early bootup code.
This incident i think shows that bisection and testing in -mm doesnt 
always cut it (bisection-testing is quite laborous with a large distro 
kernel), and i think we could do more technological measures in this 
area to lower the bar of entry for users to help us narrow down such 
bugs. Such as a KERN_DEBUG policy for annotating new code in the bootup 
path.
