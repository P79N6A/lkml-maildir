COW is a possibility, but I understood (perhaps wrongly) that Linus was
thinking of a single syscall or such like to prepare the snapshot. If
you're going to start doing things like this, won't that mean you'd then
have to update/redo the snapshot or somehow nullify the effect of
anything the programs does so that doing it again after the snapshot is
restored doesn't cause problems?
I was going to leave it at that and press send, but perhaps that
wouldn't be wise. I feel I should also ask what you're thinking of as a
means of making sure userspace doesn't do much activity.
Thanks for your labours!

Nigel
