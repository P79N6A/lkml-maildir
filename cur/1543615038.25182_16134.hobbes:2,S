Understood.   However, why can't that combination "just work"?  Changing
/etc/fstab every time I switch between sticking in a CD-ROM and DVD-ROM is not cool.
Certainly that "other operating system" does not make me do that.
A disk with a blank iso9660 plus a full UDF ought to automatically mount UDF, no?
How hard would that be to detect?

PS: I manually mount anyway, and only have two DVD-ROMs, so it's not such a
big deal for me.  But as DVD rom becomes more popular it could get inconvienent.
