Since the users would have to use the locking methods, they'd all be
dependent on it, so it would either be compiled in, or "modprobe" would 
just automagically load it.
And yes, it would just attach directly to any VGA class device on PCI (and 
have some other way to detect any other kind of graphics devices).
If we make it small, simple and generic enough (serialization isn't really
a gfx-only thing), we could frigging attach it to _every_ device in the
system, at which point it doesn't even need to "attach" any more. It would 
just be there. That obviously requires that it really only do a _very_ 
generic set of minimal locks.

They can put whatever data they want in the shared data area (called
"gfx_data" in my previous pseudo-code-posting). They'd need to know about
each other if they want to cooperate, of course. The "silly driver" never 
uses the data area itself, really. It just contains a few predefined 
things, like the lock pointers, but the silly driver doesn't really even 
access them, it's up to the low-level drivers to pass in the proper lock 
to the silly driver.

That's exactly what I would do. See the example I sent out.

Please realize that I have not a _frigging_ clue what I'm talking about. 
I'm just listening in to the flame war, and throwing out suggestions in 
the middle to try to get the discussion going _forward_. I hate seeing 
hundreds of emails in my mailbox that don't seem to actually make any 
_progress_.
So my comments are likely worthless.
