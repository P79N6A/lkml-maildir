Yes, 2 niced +20 tasks taking up one CPU where 2 normal tasks
(one using full CPU and X) taking up the other. The 'Right
Thing' would be to let X switch to the other CPU and bother
the niced tasks...

But if this boost puts it above a normal task it means that
two normal tasks will bother eachother on one CPU and one
(or two) niced tasks take up the other. Not Good :(

While interactive processes may have maximum priority, I'd
like it if the kernel would take a non-niced process from
another CPU above a niced task from the current CPU when my
editor is done. That way the non-niced tasks would tend to
get out of eachother's way, only bothering the niced tasks
and not eachother.

Whoops, this was a definite brain fart on my side. We
should probably ignore the thing and get some bugfixes
done for 2.2.  After that I'll continue the scheduler
bigpatch and play with things like this a bit...
