I notice that the kernel source README (in 2.2.2, anyway) no longer includes
the warning that was in 2.0.36, that /usr/include/{asm|linux|scsi} should be
symlinks to the kernel source tree.  This crept up and got me earlier today
as I was compiling a 2.2.x kernel on a Debian 2.0.36-based system - Debian
appears to install the /usr/include/asm files in place, since the kernel
sources aren't there by default.
Maybe the 2.2 kernel compilation is meant to automagically work around this,
but on my system it seemed like I was compiling against lots of 2.0.36
include files.  What really had me going was that for about the first time
in my life I'd actually read the README (of 2.2.2) !
It could be something else causing the problem, but when I zapped the three
offending directories and replaced them with symlinks, everything worked at
once.
