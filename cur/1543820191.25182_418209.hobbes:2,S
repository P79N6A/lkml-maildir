I'm not sure all of them have to be managed under ckrm_core and rcfs
in kernel.
These functions you mentioned can be implemented in user space
to minimize the overhead in usual VM operations because it isn't
expected quick response to resize it. It is a bit different from
that of CPU resource.
You don't need to invent everything. I think you can reuse what
NUMA team is doing instead. This approach may not fit in your rcfs,
though.
