Granted, in some patches you can disable certain features by turning off config
options. Even though it's much less convenient and you might miss out on some
parts because bugs may be introduced that aren't disabled by any option and
even if you find the option that triggers the bug, you still may have lots of
code to check because the option enables a large piece of code, and will have
to work with the entire patch instead of just a small one, in the case of a
well-written patch it's mostly very inconvenient. It still is a good habit to
split out the work you do into small parts though.

I'm sorry about the rant. Besides, your comment ('Wasn't talking about
bugfixes') makes some sense, too. You were actually talking about two patches
though, which close two closely related holes. Linus was talking about the
possible bugs caused by either one of these two patches, which may be totally
unrelated to the thing they try to fix.
