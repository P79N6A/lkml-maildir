It's a bit sad to disable interupts across a memset (how big is it?) just
for the small proportion of cases which are accessing a highmem page.
What you could do is to add an `unsigned long *flags' arg to
ata_scsi_rbuf_get() and ata_scsi_rbuf_put(), and then, in
ata_scsi_rbuf_get() do
	if (PageHighmem(page))
		local_irq_disable(*flags);
