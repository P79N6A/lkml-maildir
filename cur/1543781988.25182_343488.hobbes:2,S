Just a minute, that's not what idr was designed for.  It was really
designed for enumerations (like disk) presented to the user.  That's why
using it in IRQ context hasn't been considered.
However, there is an infrastructure in the block layer called the
generic tag infrastructure which was designed precisely for this purpose
and which is designed to operate in IRQ context.
