Of course, that's entirely useless if you're not root.
So what you _really_ have to do is to call udevinfo -e.  If that
fails, call udevinfo -d, that's the old name for the option which got
changed along the way.  The result is blocks of text lines separated
by blank lines, text lines of the form:
I: value
Where I is a one-letter uppercase identifier, and value a value.
If you get E: entries, you're lucky.  All cdroms have a E: ID_CDROM=1
entry, but these entries appeared late.  Otherwise, the best bet is to
scan the S: entries for something matching /cdrom/.  When you have a
bloc of lines, get the N: entry, that's the node name, and prepend it
with the result of udevinfo -r (usually /dev/, but that's not
mandatory).  That will give you the device node path to open (don't
forget O_EXCL to avoid Hal stomping all over you), which you can then
use SG_IO with.
If udevinfo is not available, you'll have to try opening all /dev/hd*,
/dev/sr*, /dev/scd*, /dev/sg*, /dev/cdr* and /dev/dvd* (don't stop at
the first -EANYTHING though, otherwise you'll miss some).  Then you
can poke the device carefully with SG_IO.
  OG.
