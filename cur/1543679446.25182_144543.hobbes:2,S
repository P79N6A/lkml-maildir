Con, I want to give you Lots of Thanks for the work you're doing with the O1int patches.
Don't you think that we need an option in the kernel to select if we want a Server Kernel or a Desktop Kernel?
With the first one, only throughput is important and in the second one, we can take in all the stuff to improve the interactivity (preempt, 01int, granularity) so we can give more agresive interactivity to the Desktop Kernel.
Is this a sillyness?
