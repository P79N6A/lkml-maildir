That seems a bit perverse.  How will the poor userspace program know
not to access the pages you have yanked away from it?  If you plan
to kill it, better to do that directly.  If you plan to signal it
that the mapping is gone, it can just call munmap() itself.
However, do_munmap() will call zap_page_range() for you and take care of
cache and TLB flushing if you're going to do this in the kernel.
Your driver mmap function is called by do_mmap_pgoff() which takes
care of those issues, and there is no (*munmap) in file_operations---
perhaps you are the first driver writer to want to unmap in the kernel.
