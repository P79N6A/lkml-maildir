Hi Andrew,
-mm4 won't mount my ext3 root device whereas -mm3 will. Presumably this is 
some byproduct of the dev_t patches.
VFS: Cannot open root device "302" or hda2.
Please append correct "root=" boot option.
Kernel Panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on hda2.
One possible explanation is that I have devfs compiled into my kernel. I do 
not, however, have it automatically mounting on boot. It overlays /dev (which 
is populated with original style device nodes) after INIT has loaded.
Perhaps there is some other procedure I must complete before I can use 32bit 
dev_t?
