are you using a graphical (Xwindow) application ?
in that case there is absolutely no point in doing that kind of horrible
hack, as the XWindow System is network transparent, that is, you can run
the application on machine A, and have it display and be controlled on
machine B
you can even use the ssh secure shell to securely do so, in an encrypted
manner.
