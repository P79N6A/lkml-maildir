So whatever happened to this list - are those things fixed now - has any
progress been made? I've had TCQ off for ages since it's dangerous for 
me. That and ACPI are the only things that don't work in 2.6 ...at least 
for me.

Particulary, what happened to this one:

Perhaps it's a reiser bug ... but I do remember corrupting an xfs after 
reiser, and I do remember it was 100% reproducible with depth 8 but not 
32 - at 32 on boot check passes.
