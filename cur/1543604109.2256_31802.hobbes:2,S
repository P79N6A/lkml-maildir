Sorry, I didn't read your code very carefully before because
I thought it relied on ACPI.  Now I understand it better.
It doesn't use /dev/nvram, but /dev/mem.
Here's what happens when I run it.
jdthood@thanatos:~/src/sbf$ gcc sbf.c
jdthood@thanatos:~/src/sbf$ su
Password: 
root@thanatos:/home/jdthood/src/sbf# gdb -q ./a.out
(no debugging symbols found)...(gdb) run
Starting program: /mnt/p/home/jdthood/src/sbf/./a.out 
BOOT @ 0x07fd0040
CMOS register:51
(no debugging symbols found)...(no debugging symbols found)...
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
