When this protection was originally concieved it intentionally was
offing something even without an more 'full featured' LSM.  That was the
whole reason I had to drop the secondary stacking hook inside the
selinux code.
While I now understand the question, I think that this is the behavior
most people would want.  I'll revert the security enhancement for
non-LSM systems if others agree with James, but I think adding another
small bit of protection against kernel flaws for everyone who wants
security is a win.  (and remember, in kernel we still default this to
off so noone is going to 'accidentally' see and security checks in the
dummy hooks)
