I'm currently working on a framework for user-space device drivers,
that allow suitably privileged user-space programs to set up and tear
down dma regions -- essentially exposing pci_alloc_consistent and
pci_{un}map_sg to userspace -- and also to handle interrupts in user
space.  The framework is implemented as a pair of filesystems, one for
interrupts (actually, I hijack /proc/interrupts/*)  and one for
mappings --- mainly to allow easy cleanup when the userspace program
dies.
It's not yet in a fit state to release, but contact me offline if
you'd like a copy.
