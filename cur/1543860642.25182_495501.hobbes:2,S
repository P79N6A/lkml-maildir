There are many things to suspect yet:
- firewall,
- switch,
- routing,
- ifconfig,
- other misonfigured box,
- connecting
and so on.
I think you should try with some linux networking group
at first and if you really think it's driver then
netdev@vger.kernel.org (instead of linux-kernel@).
If you could send full ifconfig, route -n (or ip route
if you use additional tables) and tcpdump (all packets)
from both boxes while pinging each other and a few words
how it is connected (other cards, other active boxes in
the network?) maybe something more could be found.
Cheers,
Jarek P.
