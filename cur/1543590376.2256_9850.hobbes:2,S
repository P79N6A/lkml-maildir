Just 2 comments.
 - You should use nfs_wb_all() here rather than nfs_wb_file() since
writepage() unfortunately can't initialize the NFS writeback structure
with the correct vma->vm_file.
 - Are we allowed to protect the filemap_fdatasync() + nfs_wb_all() by
grabbing the inode->i_sem in nfs_file_close_vma()? If so, this should
be done as well.
 Otherwise, that patch looked fine to me... I'll test it out...
Cheers,
   Trond
