I'm sorry, but I don't follow you here: I have specified that MSI was 
disabled, so why do you expect this to have any effect ? (I could have 
made it clearer by adding a "both" before "turned off"...)

I also don't follow:
pci_enable_msi() is only called from mv_init_one(); I think that the 
global reset that you refer to is part of mv_init_host(), but this is 
already called in mv_init_one() before pci_enable_msi().
Anyway, during all the speed testing, I was running the exact same 
kernel that crashed - with more disks and more activity, and I 
couldn't crash it anymore. Could you suggest, based on the stack dump, 
how to make it more likely to crash again ?
