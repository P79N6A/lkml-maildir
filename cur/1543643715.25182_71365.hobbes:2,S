Thank you for taking up the completion of development on and maintenance
of this patch. I have not had the time resources to advance it myself,
though now with your help I would be glad to contribute to the effort.
If you would like to assume ownership, I'd be glad to hand it over, and
send patches removing additional instances of for_each_process() to you
as I find the time.

This is necessary regardless in order to address the larger PID space.
In the brief review of it I've done thus far, the new algorithm appears
to be both sound and efficient.
The issues addressed here are extremely important for the workloads I
must support. The algorithmic breakdown of the prior algorithms with
larger task counts was severe enough to trip the NMI oopser and deceives
users into power cycling when they are not running the NMI oopser. This
issue in fact obstructs my testing and development on other subsystems.
Thanks,
Bill
