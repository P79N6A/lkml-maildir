Hello!
While still suffering from my more or less dead harddisk I am seeing
other nice problems. I copied my blowfish encrypted partition to a samba
server. Now I want to mount it and use it:
pc-it-nico# mount
[...]
//fs2/home on /home/nico/fs2 type smbfs (rw)
pc-it-nico# mount /home/nico/fs2/home-13-Feb-2004.tar.crypt /tmp/ -o loop,encryption=blowfish 
Password: 
ioctl: LOOP_SET_FD: Invalid argument
Well, let's try to use a local copy:
pc-it-nico# cd ~nico/fs2
pc-it-nico# cp home-13-Feb-2004.tar.crypt ..
pc-it-nico# cd ..
pc-it-nico# mount -t xfs  home-13-Feb-2004.tar.crypt scice -o loop,encryption=blowfish
pc-it-nico#
This works fine.
Just wanted to report this and ask whether this is what it should be.
Greetings,
Nico
