I really don't see major technical arguments for using libata version
(especially after 2.6.29 IDE changes) but it's your call so if you want
icside removed just send me a patch and I'll apply it (given that there
are no complaints from users).
[ No strong feelings here as it will allow me to better use my time
  and concentrate on working on code that people care about. ]

Grrr.. and the other icside patch has v5->v6 mismatch.
Thanks for noticing.  I'll post corrected patches in few minutes.
