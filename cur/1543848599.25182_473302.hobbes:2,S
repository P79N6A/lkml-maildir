Perhaps it should also support partitions=none; so that those of us  
who want to use a small userspace program and device-mapper to do the  
partition discovery and access may do so without worrying about how  
the kernel perceives the partitions (if at all).  It also makes it  
fairly trivial to add support for entirely new parition types without  
having to modify the kernel at all.
