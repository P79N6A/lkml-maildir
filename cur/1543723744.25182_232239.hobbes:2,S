Plan is to build a generic watchdog driver that has a frame-work for all
watchdog drivers (or at least most of them). I think that it can be future
2.6 driver code. It's not a fundamental change :-).

Good idea. I'm first going to test iit on my different hardware (pcwd  
+ i8xx + w83627hf). Once that's good enough we can start with the
generic watchdog driver and some converted drivers.
Did you have a look allready at the different watchdog operations in 
include/linux/watchdog.h ?
Greetings,
Wim.
