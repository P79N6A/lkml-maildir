Yes, per device and per CPU. It does add up of course, but even some
megabytes of buffers should be ok for most uses. You can shrink them, if
you don't need that much. It is advised to have at least two sub-buffers
though, so shrinking the size is probably better.

Fairly inflexible, then :-)

I'm not saying they aren't useful, just saying that their are mainly
useful for dasd apparently.
Lets let this go until we know more about how to proceed.
