       'arch' really isn't a good choice of command name:
Not it isn't. But the announcment I cut and pasted the example from is
out of date.  In 1.0pre7 the command has been renamed "larch".  The 
command is really:
       > 	  % larch touched-files-prereqs REVISION
Also in the latest NEWS file and worth mentioning since some kernel
maintainers have complained:
  * NOT DONE IN THIS RELEASE, BUT MUCH REQUESTED AND LIKELY TO HAPPEN
  The directory "{arch}" in project trees should, at least optionally,
  have a different name -- but this is slightly tricky to do in an 
  upward compatible way so I'm putting it off for now.
