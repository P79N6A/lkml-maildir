Hi, Andrea.
 =>From: Andrea Arcangeli <andrea@suse.de>
 =>...
 =>I reviewed the time-related stuff in 2.2.12 and I found potential SMP
 =>races in the time-related syscalls. Basically the only problem is that the
 =>time-syscalls are not protecting against each other. They are only
 =>protecting themself against the timer irq. And this may lead to SMP
 =>races.
 => [patch omitted]
I applied your patch against 2.3.18 and tried it out, but no luck.  I
also tried protecting all reads of xtime (a multi-word structure)
with:
	read_lock(&xtime_lock);
	*dest = xtime;
	read_unlock(&xtime_lock);
but that didn't do any good either: I still see gettimeofday()
returning values smaller than were previously returned from a
userspace program, and a prink() I put in arch/i386/kernel/time.c
shows many more (smaller) time backups.
In all cases, xntpd was not run (either during the boot process or
from the command line).
 =>I can't reproduce
 =>in any way here, but I am not sure I configured xntp hard enough to
 =>trigger the race
Is there anybody near Los Angeles who would benefit from a look at my
machine?  I'd be willing to take a road trip with it to show it to
somebody smarter than myself it it'll help...  Or if somebody wants to
send me a ticket to Germany... :-)
regards,
d.
