I celebrated too early.
The kernel compiled with gcc 3.2.1 20021207 (Red Hat Linux 8.0 3.2.1-2) hung
too, it just happened to take a little longer.
Short summary:
  - The hangs are solid: 
    - nothing in the log, nothing on the screen
    - no ctrl-alt-del, numlock
    - no sysrq-s, sysrq-u, sysrq-b 
    - nmi watchdog doesn't trigger
  - The hangs mostly happen when the nightly oracle backup dump is in
    progress
    - the oracle database is on an ide disk, oracle app and the dump
      destination are on an scsi disk (Adaptec 2940, SEAGATE ST19171W)
  - HW: Intel 815EEA2LU mobo, i815, Celeron Tualatin 1.3GHz. Adaptec 2940,
    9GB Seagate, HP C1537A tapedrive (not used), IBM-DTLA-305030 ide disk.
  - The aic7xxx driver has been acting up in past: crashes on boot and 
    sometimes at runtime too. I don't know if this is at all related to the
    lock ups.
  - Kernels tried: 2.4.22-pre8/gcc-2.96-85, 2.4.21-jam1/2.4.21-jam1, 
    2.4.21-jam1/gcc-3.2.1-2, 2.4.20pre7 -- all hang.
Perhaps this is related to the "Race condition in 2.4 tasklet handling
(cli() broken?)" problem TeJun Huh and Stephan von Krawczynski have been
discussing?
Any ideas?
