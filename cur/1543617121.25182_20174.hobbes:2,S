I am looking forward to testing out the new code

Well I'm glad to hear that - I had been doing a lot of
preempt testing on my boxes, up until the time I started
using tux widely. When I told Robert of the tux/preempt
incompatibilties, he mentioned the per-cpu shared data
and said something to the effect that the tux problems
did not surprise him. I didn't get the feeling that tux was
high on his list of priorities.
Hopefully that is not the case after all -
