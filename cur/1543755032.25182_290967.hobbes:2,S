I wouldn't have noticed this at all since you didn't send it to the scsi
list, but fortunately, Al Viro drew it politely to my attention as
another example of SCSI refcounting problems.
The issue seems to be that we have a spurious scsi_cd_put() on the error
path of sr_open().  The sr_block_..() functions are the "real" block
opens and should be refcounted, the sr_...() are the pseudo cdrom opens
and should not be refcounted.
Could you try this and see if it fixes the problem?
