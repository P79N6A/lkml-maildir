Hi Alex,
	I'm working on an embedded distro, and it would be nice if I could just
mount 'packages' over the top of one another; each 'package' is a cramfs
filesystem.  I'm currently using a bunch of symlink stuff, but it's not
real pretty.  If you've got union mounting patches for testing, I'd be
interested. ;-)
regards,
	David
