My name is Kirti Desai. I am trying to write a new
console driver.
Hence I was going through the source code and  I need
your 
help in understanding it. I would be obliged if you
can help
me out. I am working on Redgar Linux 2.2-14.12 on
Celeron 400.
* Is console related to a tty_driver? We have two
functions
register_console and register_tty_driver? How are
these two
related? 
In tty_init(tty_io.c) we register dev_tty_driver  and
dev_syscons_driver?
In console_init(tty_io.c) con_init(tty_io.c for
CONFIG_VT=y) is 
called. It registers console_driver and calls
register_console(vt_console_driver).
* To do printk we need not open the /dev/console file?
What I found was
start_kernel(init/main.c) calls console_init and
kernel_thread(init..)
which calls init is called later which opens
/dev/console.
* How are stdin/stdout/stderr mapped to the tty's?
What  want to know
if that when we call say printf in user
program,finally write(1,..) gets called which calls
tty_write ,con_write. How does tty come in
picture?
* What are /dev/console /dev/tty0, /dev/tty1 files?
Any pointer to documentation ..would be  of great
help?
Thanks,
Kirti Desai
