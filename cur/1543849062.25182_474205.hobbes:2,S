Get the latest kernel.
Compile for your system
Get ntpd.
Configure for your PPS/NMEA source.
Run ntpd.
Watch performance.
Repeat watching of performance.
It is not a crash. Not an oops.
It is stuff that is visible by watching ntpq -pn output, by letting mrtg
graph stuff, etc. Watch the offset and jitter collumns.
Check /usr/sbin/ntpdc -c kerninfo output. Graph that stuff.
Over the monhts you see changes. Some of them you can explain. Some you
can't.
I can understand this is not you everyday bug but this *is* an issue.
