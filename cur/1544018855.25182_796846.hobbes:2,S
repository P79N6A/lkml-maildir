Just carrying out the steps was okay, but I don't really know what I'm
looking at. I've uploaded the trace here (about 10 seconds worth, I
think):
  
http://disenchant.net/tmp/bug-12465/trace-1/
The guest being pinged is process 4353:
kmshanah@flexo:~$ pstree -p 4353
qemu-system-x86(4353)─┬─{qemu-system-x86}(4354)
                      ├─{qemu-system-x86}(4355)
                      └─{qemu-system-x86}(4772)
I guess the larger overhead/duration values are what we are looking for,
e.g.:
kmshanah@flexo:~$ bzgrep -E '[[:digit:]]{6,}' trace.txt.bz2 
 0)   ksoftir-4    | ! 3010470 us |  }
 0)  qemu-sy-4354  | ! 250406.2 us |    }
 0)  qemu-sy-4354  | ! 250407.0 us |  }
 0)  qemu-sy-4354  | ! 362946.3 us |    }
 0)  qemu-sy-4354  | ! 362947.0 us |  }
 0)  qemu-sy-4177  | ! 780480.3 us |  }
 0)  qemu-sy-4354  | ! 117685.7 us |    }
 0)  qemu-sy-4354  | ! 117686.5 us |  }
That ksoftirqd value is a bit strange (> 3 seconds, or is the formatting
wrong?). I guess I still need some guidance to know what I'm looking at
with this trace and/or what to do next.
Cheers,
Kevin.
