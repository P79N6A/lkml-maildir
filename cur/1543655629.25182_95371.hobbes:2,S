       Perfect :) If you want, I can make the patch and tell to Alan and
   Linus. Anyway, I think you will better heared than me O:))
   
If you could take care of this, I would really be happy.
       Anyway, I'll take a look at a new macro (lets say PAGE_ALIGN_SIZE
   or something as ugly as this ;)))
   
How many places do we try to apply PAGE_ALIGN to a length?
If it's just one or two spots, perhaps the special macro
isn't worthwhile.
