OASB is special and pushes the DB less than e.g. TPC-C does. How big was
the SGA? I bet the setup didnt have use_indirect_data_buffers=true. 
(OASB is not a full-disclosure benchmark so i have no way to check
this.) All you have proven is that workloads with a limited number of
per-inode vmas can perform well. Which completely ignores my point.
