	I can't see how that works easily.  I'm not worried about a
tarball (eventually Red Hat and SuSE and Debian would have it).  I'm
thinking about this shell:
	exec 7</dlm/domainxxxx/lock1
	do stuff
	exec 7</dev/null
If someone kills the shell while stuff is doing, the lock is unlocked
because fd 7 is closed.  However, if you have an application to do the
locking:
	takelock domainxxx lock1
	do sutff
	droplock domainxxx lock1
When someone kills the shell, the lock is leaked, becuase droplock isn't
called.  And SEGV/QUIT/-9 (especially -9, folks love it too much) are
handled by the first example but not by the second.
