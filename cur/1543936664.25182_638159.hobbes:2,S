As an absolute minimum this seems reasonable to me.  I guess we could
make no arguments default to '-' also.  There are up and downsides to
doing that, as currently no arguments currently tell you the usage and
with this patch would point clearly out the '-' option.  Just assuming
stding would lose easy access to usage, which may actually be more
confusing for the beginner.  Hmmm.  Cirtainly will include this
documentation change if nothing else.
