Hi, i've just installed kernel 2.4.18-18.7.x  (from RPM) and now it
seems there are problems with my scsi devices.
I have attached an adaptec scsi  AIC7XXX adapter, the system detects the
device, but in the logs appears messages: "blk: queue c24afa18, I/0
limit 4095Mb (mask0xfffffff)", these messages didn't appear before with
my old kernel.
Also, there are another messages in the dmesg results:
kmod: failed to exec /sbin/modprobe -s -k scsi_hostadapter errno = 2
When i try to list or do something with my tape the message: st0 block
limits 1 - 16777215 bytes appears...
Sorry i'm new in this ?
Is this a bug ? a big one ? should i use instead my old kernel ?
Thanks in advance,
Karina.
