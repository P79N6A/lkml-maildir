What you are seeing is the correct behavior.  The address in si_addr is
the exact address that caused the page fault (from register %cr2).  It
appears that you were trying to access an element of a structure, where
the structure pointer was in %eax and the offset of the element within
the structure is 4 bytes.  I suggest that if you are trying to find out
if a fault happened inside a structure you check the whole range of
addresses in that structure, because any of them could have faulted.
