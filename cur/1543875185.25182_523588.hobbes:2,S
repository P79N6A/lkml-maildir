Hmm, what started this thread was libhugetlbfs maintainer complained
how "fuss" it was to create private hugetlb mapping and suggested an
even bigger kernel change with pagetable_operations API.  The new API
was designed with an end goal of introduce /dev/hugetlb (as one of the
feature, they might be thinking more).  What motivated me here is to
point out that we can achieve the same goal of having a /dev/hugetlb
with existing hugetlbfs infrastructure and the implementation is
relatively straightforward.  What it also buys us is a bit more
flexibility to the end user who wants to use the interface directly.
