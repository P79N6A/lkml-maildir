Subject: [PATCH] UML - Fix previous request size limit fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/8/16/232

[ This is both 2.6.24 and -stable material ]
The previous patch which limited the number of sectors in a single
request to a COWed device was correct in concept, but the limit was
implemented in the wrong place.
By putting it in ubd_add, it covered the cases where the COWing was
specified on the command line.  However, when the command line only
has the COW file specified, the fact that it's a COW file isn't known
until it's opened, so the limit is missed in these cases.
This patch moves the sector limit from ubd_add to ubd_open_dev.
