OTOH, it doesn't seem to be particularly wrong to allow __vmalloc
GFP_ATOMIC allocations. The correct fix is to pass the gfp_mask
to kmalloc: if you're worried about breaking the API, introduce a
new __get_vm_area_node_mask() and implement __get_vm_area_node()
as a simple wrapper that passes in GFP_KERNEL.
