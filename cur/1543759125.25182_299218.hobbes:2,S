Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Here's another series of patches that applies on top of the fixes I
posted yesterday.  This series syncs the kernel with everything ready
for merging from the OpenIB subversion tree.
Most of these patches add more support for "mem-free" mode to mthca.
This allows PCI Express HCAs to operate by storing context in the host
system's memory rather than in dedicated memory attached to the HCA.
With this series of patches, mem-free mode is usable -- in fact, this
series of patches is being posted from a system whose only network
connection is IP-over-IB running on a mem-free HCA.
Thanks,
  Roland
