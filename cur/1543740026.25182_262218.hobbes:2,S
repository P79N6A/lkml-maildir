No.  This is wrong.  There are some classes of devices, notably
PCMCIA Cardbus drivers where buggy BIOS means this should _NOT_
be done.
There are BIOSen out there which refuse to suspend/resume if the
Cardbus bridge is disabled.
It's not that the driver is buggy.  It's that the driver has far
more information than the PCI layer could ever have.
