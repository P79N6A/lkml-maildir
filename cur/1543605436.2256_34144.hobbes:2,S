That's completely missing the point of my request (which, I admit, I didn't 
make clear).  I need to allocate about 3/4 of available memory in the kernel. 
  If I had 2GB of RAM, I'd need to allocate 1.5GB.  If I had 8 GB of RAM, I'd 
need to allocate 6GB.  I just used 3GB/4GB because it's our current test platform.
