Ok, even though its not that likely that one lives without e.g.
net/ipv4/inet_connection_sock.c or net/netlink/af_netlink.c? But maybe 
some guys "really know what they are doing" and can come up with config 
that would be able to build it as module (for other than proof-of-concept 
uses I mean)... :-/

Thanks, I'll consult them in this. I've never needed to do any Kconfig 
stuff so far so it's no surprise I have very little clue... :-)
I've one question for you Andrew, how would you like this kind of 
cross-subsys toucher to be merged, through you directly I suppose?
