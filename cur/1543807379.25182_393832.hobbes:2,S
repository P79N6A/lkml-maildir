It all seems rather ironic.  We do vast amounts of development to make
certain microbenchmarks look good, then run a real workload on the thing,
find that all those microbenchmark-inspired tweaks actually deoptimised the
real workload?  So now we need to add per-task knobs to turn off the
previously-added microbenchmark-tweaks.
What happens if one process does lots of filesystem activity and another
one (concurrent or subsequent) wants lots of thread-local storage?  Won't
the same thing happen?
IOW: this patch seems to be a highly specific bandaid which is repairing an
ill-advised problem of our own making, does it not?
