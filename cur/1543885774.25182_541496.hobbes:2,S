Jeff,
I'm not happy about this ... I specifically put that reversion in
because you and Tejun told me the the reset change "is scheduled to be
merged but not too soon."
Since you knew I'd taken action on the basis of that advice, could you
at least cc me on the pull request that voids it?
I'll just pull it out of the scsi-misc tree.
James
