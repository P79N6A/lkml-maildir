The only reason for this is because once upon a time, the early FPGA
versions of the CAFÉ chip had the same PCI ident for all three
functions. The cluebat was applied; the chip was fixed long before
tape-out. We can just drop the whole class/mask thing, I suspect -- I
just want to boot it on and OLPC machine before I commit that.
