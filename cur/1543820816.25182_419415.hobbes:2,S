Subject: CLONE_NEWNS and mount command?

I stumbled across the CLONE_NEWNS flag in the clone() man page and
thought I'd see if I could write a program that would let me do things
like run an sshd on my machine in a different "namespace" created
before any network filesystems were mounted (so I could run rpm
commands without NFS timeouts, etc).
In my experiments though, I got very confused. I created the attached
program, used it to exec an xterm, then in that xterm unmounted
a NFS filesystem.
It disappeared from the mounts listed by the "mount" command
in both the old and new namespace, but if I attempted to remount
the system in the old namespace I get an error telling me it is
already mounted (even though it doesn't show up). In the new
namespace where I unmounted it, I can remount it (then it shows
up again in the mount listing in both namespaces).
Should the /proc/mounts file be paying more attention to this
"namespace" thing? Is this a bug, or just the way things happen
to work out?
