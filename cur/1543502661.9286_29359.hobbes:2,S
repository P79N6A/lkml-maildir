   Here are the settings recommended for greatest speed:
    - "386" for the AMD/Cyrix/Intel 386DX/DXL/SL/SLC/SX, Cyrix/TI
-     486DLC/DLC2 and UMC 486SX-S. Only "386" kernels will run on a 386
-     class machine.
+     486DLC/DLC2, UMC 486SX-S, and NexGen Nx5x86. Only "386" kernels

    - "486" for the AMD/Cyrix/IBM/Intel DX4 or 486DX/DX2/SL/SX/SX2,
-     AMD/Cyrix 5x86, NexGen Nx586 and UMC U5D or U5S.
+     AMD/Cyrix 5x86, and UMC U5D or U5S.
    - "586" for generic Pentium CPUs, possibly lacking the TSC 
      (time stamp counter) register.
    - "Pentium" for the Intel Pentium/Pentium MMX, AMD K5, K6 and
