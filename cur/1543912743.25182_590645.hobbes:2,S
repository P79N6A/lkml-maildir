I just added three branches to 'ALL' branch of
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jgarzik/misc-2.6.git
dmi-const		DMI constification
pciseg			x86 PCI domain support, newly updated
			for the latest Muli stuff upstream
isdn-cleanups		Obvious and simple cleanups for ISDN
All are targetted for 2.6.24.  Just sent out dmi-const and pciseg to 
LKML.  Sent isdn-cleanups to LKML, ISDN list and Karsten a while ago.
The "super mondo ISDN cleanups", converting ISDN HiSax drivers to 
PCI/PNP/ISA APIs, are not included in this batch.
