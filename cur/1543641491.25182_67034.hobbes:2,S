If we do implement (for sake of argument) /proc/sys/performance or
whatever, changing the cpufreq interface so it performs 'stacking'
would be a good idea too.
Eg, on a K6-3+ system, we could do cpu scaling and chipset throttling
just by doing a echo "min" > /proc/sys/perf or whatever, and have
the code call 'chains' of performance related features.
