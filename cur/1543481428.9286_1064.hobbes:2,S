I just installed Red Hat on a PC at home. I had this same problem.
The version of procps that RH uses, apparently doesn't use the
/etc/psdatabase any more (which you update with `psupdate`). Instead
it expects to see /boot/System.map and read its symbols directly.
Therefore, you must copy ../linux/System.map to /boot.
