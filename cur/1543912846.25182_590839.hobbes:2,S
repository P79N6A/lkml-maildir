Yeah, I found it:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2003/7/10/345
I think that if /proc/sys could be broken out as a separate filesystem, and it 
was small and simple, the embedded people would probably be happy.  Is your 
patch significantly smaller than such a filesystem would be?  (Keeping in 
mind that the smallest thing you can do is run from initramfs, and I think 
that's pulling in libfs already...)
