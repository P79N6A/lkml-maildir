What would be wrong with changing the kernel to skip the first page of
swap, and allowing us to put a signature there?  This would be really
useful for systems that mount ext2 filesystems by LABEL or UUID.  With
the exception of swap, you currently don't need to care about what disk
a filesystem is on.  Of course, LVM also fixes this, but not everyone
runs LVM.
Cheers, Andreas
