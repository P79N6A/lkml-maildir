Paul has observed that it's already done.  But it seems to not be working.

The inode_lock is taken when the address_space's first page is dirtied.  It is
also taken when the address_space's last dirty page is cleaned.  So the place
where the inode is added to and removed from sb->s_dirty is, I think, exactly
the place where we want to attach and detach address_space.dirty_page_nodemask.
