Subject: [RFC PATCH 1/2] Fix PF_NOFREEZE and freezeable race
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/19/166

This patch fixes the race pointed out by Oleg Nesterov.
* Freezer marks a thread as freezeable. 
* The thread now marks itself PF_NOFREEZE causing it to
  freeze on calling try_to_freeze(). Thus the task is frozen, even though
  it doesn't want to.
* Subsequent thaw_processes() will also fail to thaw the task since it is 
  marked PF_NOFREEZE.
Avoid this problem by checking the current task's PF_NOFREEZE status in the 
refrigerator before marking current as frozen.
