Thanks for the pointer, using version 0.8 as available in Gentoo portage for my tests.

Backlight comes back with vesafb using s2ram, not yet tested with intelfb or Xorg.
Ideally the kernel would be able to recover this without the hacks by s2ram (vesafb
post the videobios -- intelfb (or xf86-video-intel for X) would be able to properly
configure the graphics).
For the intel drivers the problem is probably missing specs from Intel...

This test passed (K7N420) with minimal amount of modules loaded (text-mode graphics).
Real suspend worked as well (s2ram -f --vbe_post) but it's not the right tuning to
get usable console back. Currently results in scrambled output with half of the
character placeholders flickering at cursor speed. (will test other options of this
version of s2ram, possibly upgrading to latest to get more options as descibed on
suspend.sf.net).
It takes about 1 minute between the moment when the first ping reply and 
userspace/display wakeup or netconsole messages.
More details to come as I get time to do more complete tests with all drivers.
