Alan is #2 out of the 42 people with terminals.

Yow. That's 60 to 65 WPM for a continuous transmission.
For the PC speaker, Baudot RTTY is easy. Data pulses are 22 ms
and stop pulses are 22, 31, or 33 ms. If the kernel is compiled
with HZ==100 then you must do the European "50 bauds" instead,
at 66.67 WPM with 20 ms data and 30 ms stop.
Ask that other Alan what frequency shift he likes; mark/space
may be 2125/2975, 2125/2295, 1275/2125, or 1275/1445.

It needs to repeat.
