Yes, Steve looks to be right. I've been busy at LinuxWorld so I only
glanced at it, but it looks like a real bug that probably (from that first
glance mind you - not much real work involved) involves moving the 
	if (!new_page) {
		allocate new page
thing down to the "success:" part. The commont about overapping the
allocation with the IO is probably fairly bogus anyway..
