Subject: [2.3.27,28][WORKAROUND] slhc.o not compiled as module when PPP is  modular

        In 2.3.27 and 2.3.28, the kernel does not mark slhc as a
module.  As
result, slhc.o is not install when modules are installed, and cannot be
insmod-ed.
        So I assume this is a small casualty of the net code
reorganization.
        The workaround that I used was to go into drivers/net, delete
ppp_genetic.o, and rerun 'make modules'.  Then I pasted the command-line
used to recompile ppp_generic.c and used it to compile slhc.c.  The I
coppied slhc.o to /lib/modules/2.3.28/drivers/net and all was fine and
dandy :)
