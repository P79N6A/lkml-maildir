The way this thread is progressing, it won't take much to get there.  We've
already propagated the inaccuracies in the "example" depencencies by 3 or
more mails.  I'm just trying to stop it before someone forgets that it's
just an example.

I'm not going to cause disruption across the board to lots of people just
because someone wants to keep the length of the symbols down.
If you really do want to do this change, then I suggest that you get in
touch with Nicolas Pitre and discuss it with him.  When you come to a
conclusion, its not as simple as patching the kernel.  You need to
update the database at www.arm.linux.org.uk/developer/machines/ to
reflect the new symbols _at the same time_ that you change them in
everyones tree, since anyone can pull down a new copy of the symbols
from the database at any time.
IMHO, a logistical nightmare to perform.
