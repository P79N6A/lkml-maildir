Unfortunately, the patches that I have posted are against 2.6.23-rc1 with the
suspend and hibernation patchset applied
(
http://www.sisk.pl/kernel/hibernation_and_suspend/2.6.23-rc1/patches/
) .
Sorry for that.
The corresponding patches on top of the current -git are in the next two
messages.
They do the following:
* replace CONFIG_SOFTWARE_SUSPEND with CONFIG_HIBERNATION
* introduce CONFIG_SUSPEND that selects CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU, if necessary,
  and make it possible to choose suspend and hibernation independently of each
  other
* update the top-level PM-related headers and the ACPI code related to suspend
  and hibernation to use the new definitions
Greetings,
Rafael
