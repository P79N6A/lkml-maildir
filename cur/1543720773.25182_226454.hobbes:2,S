I apologize, I wrote above hastily, without looking at class_simple_create
implementation.
Please take a look at the new version of patces. I changed the order so
whitespace changes are on 3rd place to ease merging. The patches are against
tonight's bk pull from Linus' tree.
There is also 4th patch that allows a device driver to register/unregister
a new device on the same bus from driver's probe/remove routine. I need this
functionality for implementing pass-through ports, I tried to work around
sysfs limitation but it was too ugly for words.
Please let me know what you think.
