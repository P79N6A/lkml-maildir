Well, TCP certainly shouldn't be sending two retransmissions
back-to-back within 2ms, especially with nothing received in between.
Not with RTO (which in Linux is never below 20ms, and according to RFC
should be conservatively rounded up to 1 second), nor with fast
retransmits or SACK.
Just an observation.
