summary:     Updated to 2.6.22-ck1 - the last ck ever :-(
So for me, it's been at least 73 patches i kept track of in a mercurial 
repo, and at least one ck for each 2.6.x kernel (x<=15), and a few 2.4 
kernels.
So i'd like to thank you a last time for all the work you accomplished 
these years.
PS: at least swap prefetch made it to the merge plan... eventually.
    Cheers Con.
