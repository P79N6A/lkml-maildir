Done. According to that command, there are no xattrs anywhere
on any of the affected file systems. So it seems my self-compiled
xattr-disabled 2.6 kernels aren't to blame.
That leaves either the FC2 or FC3 installer kernels: one of
them must have created the xattrs. I don't know why/when they
were leaked, but this is consistent with the fact that I've
only seen fsck complain about the xattr blocks once on any
given file system.
Sorry about the false alarm.
