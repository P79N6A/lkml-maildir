    [whether it's high
    frequency or not depends on the actual workload, but it can be potentially
    _very_ high frequency, easily on the order of 1 million times a second -
    then you'll call the inter-node balancer 100K times a second.]
If this is due to thread creation/death, though, you might want this level
of inter-node balancing (or at least checking).  It could represent a lot
of fork/execs that are now overloading one or more nodes. Is it reasonable
to expect this sort of load on a relatively proc/thread-stable machine?
