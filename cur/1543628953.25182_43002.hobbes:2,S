Actually it should be zero.
This is deliberate because high order pages should not be referenced by
their partial pages.  It might make sense to add a PG_large flag and
then in the immediately following struct page add a pointer to the next
page, so you can identify these pages by inspection.  Doing something
similar to the PG_skip flag.
Beyond that I get nervous, that people will treat it as endorsement of
doing a high order continuous allocation and then fragmenting the page.
