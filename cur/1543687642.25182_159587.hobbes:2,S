That's because we didn't have the "select INPUT if VT" yet..
Anyone, can we at least get a different option for this thingy then?
CONFIG_EMBEDEDDED is even more wrong in this context than in the
old one.
What about two new options to replace the old CONFIG_EMBEDDED?
 - CONFIG_AUNT_TILLIE - for this kind of shoot yourself in the foot
   protection
and
  - CONFIG_NONSTD_ABI - for the original sense of a kernel so limited
    that parts of the usual userland ABI may disappear
