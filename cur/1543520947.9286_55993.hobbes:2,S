Subject: [PATCH] 32-bit UID support for 2.3.36
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi. I have a new version of the 32-bit UID support patches for Linux
2.3.36.
The patches are available at:
http://www.engin.umich.edu/caen/systems/Linux/code/misc/2.3/20000106/
Changes in this version:
	- updated to Linux 2.3.36
	- fix ext2 interoperability problem with old kernels:
	  ext2 recycles deleted inodes without clearing out unused fields.
	  This results in corrupted uids/gids when interchanging an ext2
	  filesystem between a 32-bit UID kernel and an unpatched kernel.
	- back out recent change to Alpha shm, since this is fixed in new
	  32-bit UID SysVIPC changes
	- glibc 2.1 patch now included with full backwards compatibility
It is tested and working on the i386 architecture.
Brief description of the patches:
http://www.engin.umich.edu/caen/systems/Linux/code/misc/2.3/20000106/
	linux-arch-independ.patch
		Architecture independent changes necessary for 32-bit
		UIDs, including compatibility wrappers for old 16-bit UID
		system calls.
	linux-ipc.patch
		Support for 32-bit UIDs in SysVipc: message queues,
		semaphores, and shared memory.
		Also fixes the ABI breakage on Alpha.
	linux-ext2.patch
		Support for 32-bit UIDs in the ext2 filesystem, according
		to the HURD disk layout.
	linux-filesystems.patch
		Various patches to other filesystems to enable 32-bit
		UIDs where possible, and fix up potential problems with
		16-bit UID filesystems otherwise.
	linux-acct.patch
		Small patch to support 32-bit UIDs in the system
		accounting file.
	linux-alpha.patch
	linux-arm.patch
	linux-i386.patch
	linux-m68k.patch
	linux-mips.patch
	linux-ppc.patch
	linux-sh.patch
	linux-sparc.patch
		Architecture specific patches to enable 32-bit UID support
		via new system calls, and define the new SysVipc API.
	glibc-2.1.2-highuid.patch
		Patch against glibc 2.1 to enable use of 32-bit UIDs
		without recompiling old applications; works against 32-bit
		UID kernel or standard kernel.
Thanks,
Chris Wing
