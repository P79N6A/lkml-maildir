  The problem I've seen is there is a several second delay before the 
usb device is availble.  My solution was to stick a sleep in my initrd 
before attempting to mount /.  A more rational patch might be to retry 
mounting / after a few seconds delay before giving up.  I think I saw 
patch doing this on the usb list.
