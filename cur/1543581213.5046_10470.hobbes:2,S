Subject: PCI-SCI Drivers v1.1-7 released

The PCI-SCI v1.1-7 Drivers for Dolphin's Scalable Coherent 
Interface Adapters have been posted and are available for download 
at vger.timpanogas.org:\sci\pci-sci-1.1-7 in tar.gz and RPM 
(RedHat Package Manager Formats).  This version supports Linux kernels 
2.2.X up through 2.4.1.  These drivers are released under the 
GPL and are freely redistributible. 
NOTES:
This release corrects modversion build problems related 
to Red Hat's 7.1 Fischer Release.  This release also corrects
build problems with the #ident keyword in the SCI source 
tree with CVS.  Please note that the sci sources will 
always assume a stock kernel layout and will point to 
/usr/src/linux/include for modversioned includes and files.  
For whatever reason, RedHat 7.1 now points to a /usr/src/linux-2.4 
tree which breaks drivers built against stock kernel trees.
Also, the GCC 2.96 compiler shipped with RedHat 7.1 is terribly 
broken, and does not support #ident lines in the source code, 
which also means that RedHat 7.1 will not work properly with 
CVS (Code Versioning System) projects that use the #ident 
keyword to identify and comment files.  It generates 
an "unknown keyword" error message.  This version of the 
sources disables some CVS enablement in order to build properly 
on a RedHat 7.1 system with gcc 2.96.
Please also note that the RedHat 7.1 Fischer release with 
the Linux 2.4.0 kernel will report bogus .modinfo relocation
warnings generated by the assembler while building some .c files 
against the kernel source tree.  These messages are a due to 
severe bugs previously reported in the gcc 2.96 compiler and 
assembler on RedHat versions 7.0 and above (the list for gcc 2.96 
keeps growing).  
Please direct any comments or bug reports to linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
or jmerkey@timpanogas.org.
