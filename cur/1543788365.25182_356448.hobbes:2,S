Isnt it funny that some bugs can spot other bugs ? :)
break_lock should be declared atomic_t and used like that :
void __lockfunc _##op##_lock(locktype##_t *lock)
{
     preempt_disable();
     for (;;) {
         if (likely(_raw_##op##_trylock(lock)))
             break;
         preempt_enable();
	atomic_inc(&(lock)->break_lock);
         while (!op##_can_lock(lock))
             cpu_relax();
         preempt_disable();
	atomic_dec(&(lock)->break_lock);
     }
}
