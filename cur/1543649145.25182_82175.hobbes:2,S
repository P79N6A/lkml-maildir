I am half insulted.  kexec is about as ready to merge as it comes...
But I do admit the code to safely position the new kernel safely in
memory safely is a little large.  
And there is not a lot of point in widespread testing of kexec until
the drivers get fixed to actually do something when device_shutdown
runs.  As drivers that don't shutdown properly are a fairly serious
issue. 
If you are interested I can break out my reboot time hardware bug
fixes, and send you those.
