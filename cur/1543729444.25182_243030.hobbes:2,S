I noted that in a couple of reject messages the server has posted (and 
I don't recall if it came from you, normally they are from some 
obviously spammish src) that there is a list of attachement ".ext" 
specifiers that they will /dev/null.  There have been 2 of those just 
this morning, but they get the big red X treatment here (kmail) 
before they get lost in the other 10,000 plus messages of this list.
Does the reverse dns lookup work as expected?  I think thats another 
reason, but since the text msgs are coming ok, I drift off in the 
direction of the attachements extension as the reason.  This list 
seems to be in favor of inlining any patches which removes that 
aspect of the filtering done.
