Is there some limit to the number of SCSI drives detectable when loading
SCSI drivers as modules?  I've sean similar behavior from two distinct
SCSI cards.  A Future Domain TMC-18C30 and an Adaptec 1510a.  Both drivers
would only detect 3 of 5 or 3 of 4 SCSI drives on the chain.  The Future
Domain driver has an option to enable the use of some old SCSI device
detection code.  If I enable this code section, the Future Domain driver
is able to detect all the drives on the chain.  Unfortunately the Future
Domain has also proved unreliable and I would like to switch to the
Adaptec insead, so is there any way I can get that driver to recognize all
of my SCSI drives?
