You just proved my point.  It is extremely difficult to deduce the
required initialisation order by reading an undocumented Makefile where
the init order is implemented as a side effect of selection order.  The
existing method implies link order when none is required.

I was using scsi and fs as examples, no need to pick holes in the
examples.  But ...
  fs/buffer.c:module_init(bdflush_init)
  fs/pipe.c:module_init(init_pipe_fs)
  fs/fcntl.c:module_init(fasync_init)
  fs/locks.c:module_init(filelock_init)
  fs/dnotify.c:module_init(dnotify_init)
I'm no filesystem expert but it appears that some of those core
initialisation routines must be executed before most filesystems can
start.  In particular, filelock_init() must be executed before any
filesystem that supports locks is initialised.

Firstly inter_module_xxx is only used by that very small subset of code
where there are no constraints on whether the caller and callee can be
in kernel, in modules or a mixture _and_ some of the objects are
optional.  It is a special case because most code handles this problem
through CONFIG options.  If X needs (Y, Z) and X is built into the
kernel then (Y, Z) must also be built into the kernel.  If Y or Z are
optional then control the calls to those functions with CONFIG options.
Almost all of the kernel handles it properly though CONFIG, so
inter_module_xxx is already a process to handle a few special cases.
Secondly you want static inter_module_xxx tables for a small subset of
these special cases, where the source has no other initialisation code.
This is piling special cases on special cases.  Adding static
inter_module_xxx tables requires
* changes to linux/modules.h to define the new table format and
* changes to vmlinux.lds for _every_ architecture to bring all the
  static tables together in vmlinux and
* new initialisation code in module.c to read and load all the static
  tables at boot time and
* extra code in modutils to find any static tables in modules and
* an extension to struct modules to let modutils pass information about
  the static tables to the kernel and
* the kernel code will only work with an upgraded modutils.
That is a lot of work for a very few special cases.  OTOH, you could
just swap the order of 3 lines in drivers/mtd/Makefile.  Guess which
alternative I am going for?
