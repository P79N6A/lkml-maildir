What are we really discussing here?  The original issue that you raised 
with the infrastructure was an fs vs. syscall interface and I simply 
argued in favor of an fs-based approach because containers are inherently 
hierarchial.  As Paul Jackson mentioned, this is one of the advantages 
that cpusets has had since its inclusion in the kernel and the abstraction 
of cpusets from containers makes a convincing case for how beneficial it 
has been and will continue to be.
Regardless of whether configfs is specifically used for this particular 
purpose is irrelevant in deciding fs vs syscall.  Certainly it could be 
used for lightweight purposes but it by no means is the only possibility 
for containers.  I have observed no further advocation for a syscall 
interface; it seems like a no-brainer that if there are certain 
limitations on configfs that you have pointed out that would be 
disadvantageous to containers that another fs implementation would 
suffice.

Ok, so each of these issues includes a specific criticism against configfs 
for containers.  So a different fs-based interface similiar to the cpuset 
abstraction from containers is certainly appropriate.
