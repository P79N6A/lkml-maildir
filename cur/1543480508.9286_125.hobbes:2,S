Well, my suggestion is to first cut-and-paste a complete kernel oops from
your syslog into a file and run it thorugh ksymoops.  Look at where ksymoops
think you the panic was.
I'm seeing similar things in the 2.0.36 kernel, and I'm beginning to think
it's a race condition between the ext2fs driver and the tcp/ip driver.
I've seen this same kernel oops in prior linux kernels, but it was much
less frequent than with 2.0.36 - I haven't been able to troubleshoot this,
as I have very little kernel debugging experience (if someone would like
to teach me the basics such as where to start, what software to use,
I'll go debug this one myself).
Every oops refers to:
>>> Process suck (pid: 594, process nr: 70, stackpage=025f6000)
Now, as comical as it might be to see "process suck" causing a kernel
oops, for those who don't know what "suck" is, it's a small program,
that's being maintained by Robert A. Yetman, that allows you to
"suck" a newsfeed from an NNTP server.  Indeed, if it's generating
kernel oopses, it does indeed "suck".  :-)
It seems to oops in the exact same way each time (as in, the ksymoops
is identical from oops to oops).  Only for this process.  It's quite
reproducible, just at a random time.  *snicker*
If anyone cares to help track this one down, please send me e-mail.
If anyone thinks a re-write of "suck" in Perl would be a good idea,
let me know - I've contemplated doing this for quite some time now...

For scrutiny, here's the oops and ksymoops output that I get, repeatedly
and reliably with 2.0.36:
