So the GUI represents compound documents differently from simple
documents.  Big deal -- it's a different icon.
GUI needs to support maybe two operations on this thing: move and open.
Whatever deals with "open" also needs to be able to save such documents.
Oh!  This is TOO COMPLEX for me.  I think we'd better rewrite the kernel.
