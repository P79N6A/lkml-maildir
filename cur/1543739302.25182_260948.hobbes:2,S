That is awesome! I am all for moving this outside of the kernel, as it 
would allow the use of ream vm86() services for VGA/VESA BIOS access on 
x86 and the user of the emulator for non-x86 platforms. 
The only catch would be making sure this stuff is available really early 
in the boot sequence. As it stands right now the solution we have brings 
up the video almost imediately after you see the 'uncompressing kernel 
image' message on the serial port. The other solution of course is to get 
this into the boot loader which is what the AmigaOne folks did for their 
machines (U-Boot brings up the video). We are working with those guys to 
update their BIOS emulator to the latest version as the one they have 
doesn't work that reliably.
Anyway how do I find out more about this in 2.6?
Also I assume the code would need to end up in the initrg image, correct? 
Can you point me at some resources to learn more about how to get custom 
code into the initrd image?
