sounds like you're using the shared irq slot, might want to verify that with
lspci -vvv to see if anything else is using an irq at the time that's the
same as the card in that slot.  Also some places will do various special
things to one of the last pci slots, you should be able to find out by
looking in the manual.  Some cards just dont play nicely with shared irqs.
Then there's always the locality to some other device in the case possibly
causing your problem.   many reasons could cause the problem you're
describing.   I'm not really sure how this is a linux problem though since
you mention it's occuring only in a certain physical slot.
