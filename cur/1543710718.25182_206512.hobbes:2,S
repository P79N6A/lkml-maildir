I can't see that you would, no. But maybe I've missed something.
We apply pressure equally except when there is a shortage in a
low memory zone, in which case we can scan only the required
zone(s).
This case I think is well worth the unfairness it causes, because it
means your zone's pages can be freed quickly and without freeing pages
from other zones.
