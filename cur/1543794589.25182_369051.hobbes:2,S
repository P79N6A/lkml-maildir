I disagree with this patch. NET_CLS enables the infrastructure support
for classifiers. Users generally don't care about infrastructure but
directly usable things, so I'd prefer to have it automatically selected. 
And there are lots of other cases where enabling a module causes changes
in the kernel image. Some examples include some of the netfilter stuff,
the IPsec transforms, NET_CLS_ROUTE4, the ieee80211 stuff, and a lot
more.
