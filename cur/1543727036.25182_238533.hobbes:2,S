So you can do port I/O on low addresses but not memory accesses?  For some 
cards simply throwing away reads and writes to the low memory area is 
probably ok since it'll just be doing things like printing a BIOS banner or a 
pretty logo.  But then again, I've never disassembled one so I can't be sure.  
Alan would probably know though :)
If you can't do legacy port I/O on a given bus though, I think you'd be out of 
luck wrt POSTing a card with an x86 BIOS.
