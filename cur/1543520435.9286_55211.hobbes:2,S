Also, davem, I've got a spare dual SS20 not doing anything except pulling
paperweight duty here.. I've kept it in the realm of 2.2's, but now that
you say 2.3 is in 'dire disrepair' I'll fire it up and give it a shot
sometime next week. My employer has now decided to completely rewire the
building in the final week of the century... sigh.
