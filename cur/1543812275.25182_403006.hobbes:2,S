Ok, hot plug of motherboards.  The pieces fall together now for me.
Most things controlled by isapnp are either cold plug or not even
pluggable (like most serial ports).  So imaging them in a hot-plug
situation takes some effort.  But node/cell based NUMA systems
where you plug and unplug motherboards.  That make sense.
