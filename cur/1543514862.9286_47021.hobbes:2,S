Documentation/IO-mapping.txt

No.  NO DIRECT REFERENCES OF IOREMAP'd ADDRESSES.  It works on some
architectures, but is not portable.  ALWAYS use {read,write}[bwl]

It's already in Documentation/IO-mapping.txt

base_address[] is a bus address

You can't complain if you aren't reading all the docs ;)
