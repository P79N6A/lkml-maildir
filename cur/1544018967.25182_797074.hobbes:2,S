The instrumentation is really simple, see kernel/tracing/trace_irqsoff.c:
we call this function if hardirqs are disabled anywhere in the kernel:
 static inline void
 start_critical_timing(unsigned long ip, unsigned long parent_ip)
and we call this function if hardirqs are enabled anywhere in the kernel:
 static inline void
 stop_critical_timing(unsigned long ip, unsigned long parent_ip)
that's all. You need a single line check in stop_critical_timing(), 
something like this:
   WARN_ON_ONCE(per_cpu(hardirqs_forced_off, this_cpu));

More reliable than a WARN() triggering right at the buggy place that 
erroneously enables IRQs? Regardless of how obscurely it's done - whether 
it's a side effect of something, etc. etc.?
With such a generic facility you'd not have to put in any explicit checks 
anywhere _at all_.
In fact whatever check you put in it's _always_ going to be fundamentally 
more fragile than direct instrumentation: you cannot possibly check all 
possible places that enable interrupts. (they could be disabling 
interrupts as a _restore_irqs() sequence for example)
