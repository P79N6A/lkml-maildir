Bah!  Nothing is ever as easy as it looks.
According to the manpage, nice(2) is per-process not per-thread.  That
does not give the granularity we need.  
Is that correct?  If so, I can't think of any way to make this work.
Suggestions?
We need to allow both realtime and non-realtime threads in the same
process.  Anything less would require an enormous rewrite for most
audio programs, an unreasonable thing to ask.
