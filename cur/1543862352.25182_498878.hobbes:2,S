If I got it right (and please someone tell me if I *really* got it right!),
the problem is elsewhere.
Suppose you have a filesystem, not at all related to databases and stuff.
Your usual root filesystem, with your /etc/ /var and so on directories.
Some time ago you edited /etc/shadow, updating it by writing new file and
renaming it to proper place.  So you have that old content of your shadow
file (now deleted) somewhere on the disk, but not accessible from the
filesystem.
Now, a bad guy deliberately tries to open some file on this filesystem, using
O_DIRECT flag, ftruncates() it to some huge size (or does seek+write), and
at the same time tries to use O_DIRECT read of the data.
Due to all the races etc, it is possible for him to read that old content of
/etc/shadow file you've deleted before.

"hope that sparse files are handled right" is a high hope.  Exactly because
this very place IS racy.
Again, *IF* I got it correctly.
