Subject: [PATCH 3/4] jffs2: fix sparse warning in write.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/15/553

fs/jffs2/write.c:585:28: warning: symbol 'fd' shadows an earlier one
fs/jffs2/write.c:536:27: originally declared here
No need to redeclare fd, use the original one, after this point,
fd is always reassigned before it used again.
