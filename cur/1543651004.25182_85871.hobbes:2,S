[ patch snipped ]
Initrd works now, thanks.
The box still doesn't boot through, the initrd fails to load the ext3
module due to unresolved symbols (mb_cache_*).  That issue looks like a
kbuild problem to me:  I have ACL's enabled (which builds the mbcache.o
module).  I also have the nfs server with v4 support enabled (which
doesn't build currently).  Running "make -k modules_install" does _not_
install the mbcache.o in /lib/modules/2.5.45.  I suspect this happens
due to the build error in the nfsd subdirectory.
