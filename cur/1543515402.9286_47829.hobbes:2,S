I have a friend with the same motherboard but using dual over-clocked 550 MHz
Celeron.  This symptom is noted even on 2.2.14pre4, however this is related
to over-clock problem.  When he down clocking the bus by 1 MHz (running at 
544 MHz) this problem went away.
Try lower the bus clock by a notch or two.  See if the problem still persist.
Also make sure you have enough cooling.
