Well, that was what I saw, it took gzip about 4 or 5 minutes to get to the 
first 90% hit in htop's display, and it first hit the top of the display with 
only 5%.  And the next backup run took about 2h:21m, so we're back in the 
ballpark.  I'd reset amanda's schedule for a faster dumpcycle too, along with 
giving the old girl a new drive, all about the time we started playing with 
this, so the times I'm recording now may well be nominal.  I suppose I should 
boot a plain 2.6.21-rc7 and make a run & time that, but I don't enjoy 
masochism THAT much. :)

I've enjoyed just about as much of this as I can stand.
