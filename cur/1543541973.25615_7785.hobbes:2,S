Can you point me/us to any references on the SMP scalability of various
workloads and/or how to diagnose them?
I suppose if you're runing 1/2 as slow as you think you should be on a 4
CPU box and you disable two of the CPUs and it doesn't get any slower then
you know you've got a scalability problem somewhere.  I don't know how I
would got about determining that the userspace workload inherantly didn't
scale though.
