i've reworked the code to use the read-lock to access the per-CPU data
RCU structures, and it boots with 2 CPUs and PREEMPT_RT now. The -40-05
patch can be downloaded from the usual place:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/
had to add two hacks though:
 static void rcu_advance_callbacks(struct rcu_data *rdp)
 {
        if (rdp->batch != rcu_ctrlblk.batch) {
                if (rdp->donetail) // HACK
                        *rdp->donetail = rdp->waitlist;
		...
 void fastcall call_rcu(struct rcu_head *head,
          void (*func)(struct rcu_head *rcu))
 [...]
        rcu_advance_callbacks(rdp);
        if (rdp->waittail) // HACK
                *rdp->waittail = head;
	...
without them it crashes during bootup.
maybe we are better off with the completely unlocked read path and the
long grace periods.
