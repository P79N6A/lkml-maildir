Um.  It doesn't take nearly 10Ghz to handle 10Mbps, or even 100Mbps.

If the host CPU is a bottleneck after large-send and checksums have been 
offloaded, then logically you aren't getting any work done _anyway_. 
You have to interface with the net stack at some point, in which case 
you incur a fixed cost, for socket handling, TCP exception handling, etc.
Maybe somebody needs to be looking into AMP (asymmetric 
multiprocessing), too.
