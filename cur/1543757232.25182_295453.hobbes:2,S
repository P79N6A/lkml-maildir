Jon, it looks like the loop at the bottom of pci_map_rom is busted?
        do {
                void __iomem *pds;
                /* Standard PCI ROMs start out with these bytes 55 AA */
                if (readb(image) != 0x55)
                        break;
                if (readb(image + 1) != 0xAA)
                        break;
                /* get the PCI data structure and check its signature */
                pds = image + readw(image + 24);
                if (readb(pds) != 'P')
                        break;
                if (readb(pds + 1) != 'C')
                        break;
                if (readb(pds + 2) != 'I')
                        break;
                if (readb(pds + 3) != 'R')
                        break;
                last_image = readb(pds + 21) & 0x80;
                /* this length is reliable */
                image += readw(pds + 16) * 512;
        } while (!last_image);
It looks like it's trying to verify all the ROMs on a given PCI device rather 
than just the one we just ioremap'd above.  Should this check just be inline 
and the loop deleted?  In that case, all of the breaks would turn into return 
NULLs (though the code should probably be refactored to make that a little 
clearer) along with an iounmap?
Thanks,
Jesse
