the pci-express variants are, but the functionality is almost always disabled (and
relatively new anyway).
even with multiqueue, you can still have only a single irq line (which defeats the
purpose of course mostly).

never will, an irq can only be processed on one cpu at a time anyway, obviously
the irq here has been migrated ONCE from one of the cpu's to the other.
unfortunately you can't see from /proc/interrupts whether this happens frequently
or not, or how many times it happened before.
