Errm...  __memblk_to_node(5)
I"m not saying that we couldn't add a similar interface for zones... 
something along the lines of:
	__memblk_and_zone_to_flat_zone_number(5, DMA)
or some such.  It just isn't there now...
Also, right now, memblks map to nodes in a straightforward manner (1-1 
on NUMA-Q, the only architecture that has defined them).  It will likely 
look the same on most architectures, too.
Cheers!
