Make up for a lack of poor hardware design.  Most IPMI controllers
that use the standard-specified KCS interface don't implement
interrupts to signal data availability, and its a character-at-a-time
interface.
Without this kernel thread, ordinary operations (ipmitool sensor list)
would take 30 seconds, essentially one character transfer per timer
tick.  Starting applications that would read a lot of IPMI data would
take 5 minutes.  Doing a firmware flash would take 15 minutes.
With the kernel thread, these ops drop to 5-7 seconds, <1 minute, and
~1.5 minutes respectively.  It does this by polling at a rate faster
than the timer tick, in a low-priority kernel thread, any time a
command is outstanding to the controller.  If no commands are
outstanding, it goes to sleep for a tick, then wakes up (in case the
controller itself generates an event so we can capture that).
The trouble is, with udelay(1), it could consume the CPU while waiting
for a command to complete on the controller, without letting other
tasks run.  This exhibited itself as jittery mouse movement as well as
soft lockup messages.
We need to be able to poll at faster-than-timer-tick rates, yet let
other higher-priority apps run.  Hence the schedule().  We're open to
other suggestions, but this seemed minimally intrusive while
accomplishing the goal.  No more soft lockups or jittery mice.
Thanks,
Matt
