No firewall.
And the "lp" is just to print to a file@localhost.
# lpadmin -p lp -i /etc/cups/interfaces/lp -v lpd://localhost/file -o
printer-error-policy=retry-job
# lpadmin -p file -i /etc/cups/interfaces/file -v file:/dev/null -o
printer-error-policy=retry-job
Filter for lp is ..
  cat $6
Filter for file is ...
  cat $6 >/tmp/$$
Thanks,
Jeff.
