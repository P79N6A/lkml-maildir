BKL hold times in sync_old_buffers aren't good.  This is one of the last 
places that we see millisecond-scale BKL hold times.
  0.09%  8.1% 4598us(9648us)  105us( 231us)(0.00%)        37 91.9%  8.1% 
    0%    sync_old_buffers+0x1c
So, I'll ask the eternal question that plagues us all, why is the BKL 
held here?  I saw some discussions referring to races prevented by BKL here:

With the addition of sb_lock and refcounting on the sb, are these races 
still there?  sync_supers() and sync_unlocked_inodes() both hold sb_lock.
If we just remove the BKL from sync_old_buffers() the long hold time 
goes from BKL to sb_lock.  But, sb_lock is dropped and reacquired a few 
times in that code, so latency should be better than BKL.  BKL wouldn't 
have been released except in those places where it had to drop the locks 
and sleep.
Patch to do it is attached, but I'm not holding my breath.
