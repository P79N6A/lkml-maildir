No, that's not possible. Whenever we change vm_pgoff, vm_start, or
vm_end, we reshuffle the prio_tree. Check mm/mmap.c:vma_adjust().

Yes. That's possible. But we have to expand the vm_area_struct
by sizeof(unsigned long).

I don't understand what you are thinking. I reread your last mail
to try to understand, but I don't get it.
If you are thinking vm_set.head or vm_set.parent is free to use
for h_index, then it is incorrect. No field is free. If a vma
is a tree node (and in this discussion we care only about tree
nodes), then every field in vma->shared is used. We cannot reuse
them for storing h_index.

Yeah. We can use a "#define vm_pgoff shared.r_index". But, that's
very ugly, so we have to change all accesses of vm_pgoff leading to
a relatively intrusive patch.

If we impose that there can be only 2 types of prio_tree, then
we can simply add an if-else condition in the GET_INDEX macro.
IMHO, that will not lead to any noticeable performance drop.
But, I agree with you that changing the layout of vm_area_struct
is a better (but intrusive) approach.
Thanks,
