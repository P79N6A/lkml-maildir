I suspect the right fix is in-between. We should try to push hardware
makers away from using SMIs recklessly, but we should also do our best
to work around those that don't. The same problems crop up w/
virtualization where time-based calibration may be interrupted.
George, again, there has been some SMI resistant delay calibration code
added recently. You mentioned this problem was seen on 2.4 kernel, so
you could verify that the new code in 2.6.14 works and if so, try
backporting it.
If not we need to see what else we can do about improving delay
calibration (its a similar tick-based problem to what I'm addressing
with the timeofday rework) or reducing the use of delay by using
something else.
