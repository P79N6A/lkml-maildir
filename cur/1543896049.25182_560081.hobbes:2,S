I don't see why it would seem a good idea to replace a simple find_token 
  function that searches for 2 byte tokens with a call to memmem. So, I 
think this is not something a janitor would do.
The call to memmem was actually a left-over from a previous algorithm 
that used variable sized tokens. With fixed size, 2 byte tokens, having 
a specialized function is probably more efficient anyway.
