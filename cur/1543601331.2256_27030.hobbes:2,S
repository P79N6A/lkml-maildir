Subject: compiled-in (non-modular) USB initialization bug

A few months ago I posted a bug report about the Pegasus driver not
initializing  (or not initializing fast enough to work with NFS-Root) when
compiled-in. I've found that this is not specific to the
pegasus, as I have recently noticed that the kernel 'driver-initialized'
messages for my USB mouse and keyboard (i.e. HID devices) come up AFTER
init has been started. These drivers are also 'compiled-in'
The problem this poses is that some applications (like NFSRoot) need
access to USB devices BEFORE the kernel mounts filesystems/starts init.
