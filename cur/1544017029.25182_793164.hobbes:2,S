In terms of memory footprint of metadata, SLQB and SLUB both use the
struct page for this, so no advantage. In terms of performance, well
it seems that SLUB is not faster with higher order allocations, but
slower with order-0 allocations. So this seems to just be an argument
for using higher order allocations in SLUB, rather than an argument
against using order-0 in SLQB or SLAB>

Yes I know that. But it's pretty theoretical IMO (and I could equally
describe a theoretical situation where increased fragmentation in higher
order slabs will result in worse TLB coverage).
Has there been a demonstrated advantage of this? That outweighs the
costs of using higher order allocs? If so, then I could just add some
parameters to SLQB to allow higher order allocs as well.

As I said, this is not my experience. Queue trimming is a third order
problem and barely makes any difference in a running workload. It just
serves to clean up unused memory when slabs stop being used. There is
basically no performance implication to it (watermarks are far more
important to queue management of a busy slab).
Tens of millions of objects can be allocated and freed between queue
trimming intervals.

Yeah but it happens so infrequently it should be in the noise. I have
never seen any real problems caused by this. Have you?

The same can be said of SLQB and SLAB as well.

Exactly the same way SLQB can move a queue of remotely freed objects back
to the allocating processor. It just manipulates a head pointer. It doesn't
walk every object in the list.

It is still a much bigger problem with 16x larger pages. If you have targetted
reclaim and 32K slabs, then you will still have a bigger problem than
targetted reclaim and 4K slabs (and the targetted reclaim will be less
efficient because it will have to free more objects).

That's wrong. SLUB keeps completely free pages on its partial lists, and
also IIRC can keep free pages pinned in the per-cpu page. I have actually
seen SLQB use less memory than SLUB in some situations for this reason.
