So it does reach the kernel, right? I don't know if I remembered that call 
correctly, but "lcall $0xffff,$0" should call the real mode BIOS reset 
code...
Anyone else who can correct me here?
Perhaps the disk driver is going mad? Has anyone tried to boot a kernel 
without any disk drivers with a minimal root system on an initrd?
Cheers,
Stefan
