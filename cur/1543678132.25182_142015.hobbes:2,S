Mine doesn't work either, I have a RBEM56G-100.
Bought this off ebay for quite cheap to replace my REM56G-100.
It detects it, etc etc, but never actually works.
I put the REM56G-100 back in, insmod'd the driver, and back in business.
I haven't tried a 2.5.x kernel, nor a 2.4.21(it's on my list of things to
do)
I was using the xircom_cb driver though.  The xircom_tulip_cb didn't work
either.
