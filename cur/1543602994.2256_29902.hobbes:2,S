Let's see, with X, the server is local (at least, it's local to where
I've placed my ass) and the client is remote.
I usually think of "server" as the box that's running all the time,
providing a service to multiple clients. In this case, the netconsole
server should always be running, accepting log messages for
storage. The clients (which are transitory, otherwise netconsole
wouldn't be needed:-), initiate work for the server to do.
Face it, Ingo's use of "client" and "server" is contrary to accepted
usage. You can't finesse around it.
