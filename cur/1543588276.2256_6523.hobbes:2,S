Hello,
I am using usleep in an application under RH7 kernel 2.4.2. However,
when I bring its argument down to 20 miliseconds (20.000 microseconds)
or less, this seems to be ignored by the function (or the machine's hw
timer), which behaves as if 20 ms where its lowest acceptable value. How
can I measure the precision of usleep in my box ? I am currently using
an Dell GX110 PIII 866 MHz.
Thanks in advance.
Marcus.
