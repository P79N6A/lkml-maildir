Hi,
I've got a problem booting the linux kernel 2.5.60-bk1 and -bk2. 2.5.60 works 
with no problems! The last messages before halting are (hand copied):
VFS: Mounted root (reiserfs filesystem) readonly.
Freeing unused kernel memory: 220k freed
INIT: version 2.78 booting
And then nothing else happens...
Of course there are no entries in the log files. My config-file is attached.
My machine is a K6-III 450 with following filesystems:
/ is reiserfs on /dev/hda5
/boot is ext3 on /dev/hda3
Greetings
