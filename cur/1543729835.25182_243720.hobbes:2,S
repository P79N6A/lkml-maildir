Face it, you think anything anyone says (including Alan, Linus, me,
and anyone else who happens by) anything about your precious cdrtools
is making meaningless remarks. Allowing users to fuck hardware using a
badly written permissions system _is_ a security hole, no matter how
much you dance around the issue.
This is why Linus added what he did, so users couldn't; which means
_fix your damn program and quit your bitching_.
