I think the least-intrusive solution is something like this:

Where ide_driveid_needs_swapping() is #define'd to return 0 (never swap), 1
(always swap), or whatever architecture-specific logic you need.
We can even have defaults in <linux/ide.h>
    #ifndef ide_driveid_needs_swapping
    # ifdef __LITTLE_ENDIAN
    #  define ide_driveid_needs_swapping(id)	0
    # else
    #  ifdef __BIG_ENDIAN

    #  else
    #   error "Please fix <asm/byteorder.h>"
    #  endif
    # endif
    #endif
Sounds sufficiently sane?
