The feature freeze certainly seems to be an important part of things . . .
now we just need to determine what we want to happen during and after the
feature freeze. :-) I certainly think Linus' Linux should be in a CVS tree,
and he should patch to that; in addition, other developers, like Alan Cox,
should have commit access to the tree, but Linus has already shown that he
doesn't want that. Either way, I say "testing, testing, testing!". :-)
