Ingo,
On the Intellistation and LS-20 configuration I just reported the irqpoll bug 
about, if we don't use irqpoll to boot and it actually boots up and things 
seem to be working fine, when we go to reboot, it doesn't ever completely 
shut down:
The system is going down for reboot NOW!
INIT: Sending processes the TERM signal
Stopping cups-config-daemon: [  OK  ]

Sending all processes the TERM signal...
And it gets stuck here.  That machine is not dead or hung.  I can type stuff 
and it shows up on the terminal, but it does not seem to be running anything.  
I can reboot it with the sysrq keys.
I tested this against 2.6.16-rt16 and I haven't seen this problem after about 
6 reboots.  So I think this is a regression.
