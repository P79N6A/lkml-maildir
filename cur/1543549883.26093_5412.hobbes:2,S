Hi Albert,
> See the Signal 11 FAQ... you can start with:
>
> 1. make sure the memory in bank 4 is properly seated
> 2. make sure your case is cool enough inside
> 3. make sure your power supply is good
> 4. try new RAM
> 5. try a new motherboard
Memory: ECC Mem in all banks, status:
[root@delphi1 log]# cat /proc/ram
Chipset ECC capability : ECC detection and correction
Current ECC mode : ECC detection and correction
Bank    Size    Type    ECC     SBE     MBE
0       128M    SDR     Y       0       0
1       128M    SDR     Y       0       0
2       128M    SDR     Y       0       0
3       128M    SDR     Y       0       0
Total   512M
So memory problems seem to be out. (kernel did not panic on machine check
exception, so machine is still up after reported exception)
Temperature / power:
[root@delphi1 log]# sensors

Adapter: ISA adapter
Algorithm: ISA algorithm
VCore 1:   +1.60 V  (min =  +1.56 V, max =  +1.72 V)
VCore 2:   +1.61 V  (min =  +1.56 V, max =  +1.72 V)

+12V:     +11.86 V  (min = +11.36 V, max = +12.58 V)
-12V:     -11.51 V  (min = -11.13 V, max = -12.55 V)
-5V:       -4.88 V  (min =  -4.74 V, max =  -5.24 V)

Looks OK as well, no peaks / anomalys reported for the time of the error as
well. System is running with 1 case fan, 1 fan for the hd's and one for the
power supply.
Leaves faulty CPU or motherboard; I've got 4 identical systems, this is the
first strange message reported so far on any of them.
Just finished 30 minutes of compiling the kernel w/o further problems; let's
see what it says tomorrow morning.

Doesn't look like anything got hurt; restore of last backup + transaction
logs on the backup server gives identical full database export as live
database.

Guess I'll have to take that as a possible explanation, there sure doesn't
seem to be anything else fishy going on.
Thanks for the info on meaning of the exception.
Bye, Martin
