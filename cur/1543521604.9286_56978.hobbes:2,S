Would a patch to add persistent variables for modules be accepted into
the kernel?  Modules define variables like this
static __persistent cache * cache_p;
__persistent in a module stores the data in a separate ELF section,
when the code is builtin __persistent is a no-op.  modutils and
kernel/modules allocate and initialize storage for __persistent the
first time the module is loaded.  Unloading a module does not remove
the __persistent data, reloading the module will reuse but not
initialize the assigned storage.
Easy enough to code but it is not worth doing unless the patch stands a
chance of being accepted into the kernel.  So would this feature be
worthwhile?
