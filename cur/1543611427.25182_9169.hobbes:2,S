 No, of course not -- if I had got a response like "this looks mostly OK,
but please check other drivers", then I would have certainly done.  I
think drivers/tc/zs.c is OK, too, but this was more than a year ago, so I
can't recall now, sorry.

 Indeed -- maybe something was changed past 2.4.5, after all.  I'll check
how things look like these days.  I nowhere use serial.c as a module
anymore, as all systems I maintain are now configured for the serial
console, so I might have missed something.
