    It's rather contrarywise -- this is standard approach and gianfar with its 
3 TSEC IRQs has a quite non-standard poll_controller() implementation.

    KGDBoE is considered a better test (I hope you've also tested with it).

    Why not make it less complex (for a reader and gcc too :-) ?
	struct ucc_geth_private *ugeth = netdev_priv(dev);
	int irq = ugeth->ug_info->uf_info.irq;
	disable_irq(irq);
	ucc_geth_irq_handler(irq, dev);
	enable_irq(irq);
