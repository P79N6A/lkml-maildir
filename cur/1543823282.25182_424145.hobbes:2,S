I'm testing it right now, but with 2.6.17-rc4-git2 I was getting:
May 15 15:42:57 shapeshifter ata2: command 0x25 timeout, stat 0x58 host_stat 0x1
May 15 15:42:57 shapeshifter ata2: translated ATA stat/err 0x58/00 to
SCSI SK/ASC/ASCQ 0xb/47/00
May 15 15:42:57 shapeshifter ata2: status=0x58 { DriveReady
SeekComplete DataRequest }
May 15 15:42:57 shapeshifter sd 1:0:0:0: SCSI error: return code = 0x8000002
May 15 15:42:57 shapeshifter sda: Current: sense key=0xb
May 15 15:42:57 shapeshifter ASC=0x47 ASCQ=0x0
May 15 15:42:57 shapeshifter end_request: I/O error, dev sda, sector 974708575
(sector varies)
After large ssh transfers. I moved to 2.6.17-rc4-git2 because
2.6.16.16 was doing the same. This is a new 500gb sata2 drive on
sata_sil so I guess this could be hardware, but I wanted to make sure
before I go returning this thing. After this obviously I have to sysrq
sync, ro and reboot. This also causes(?) a NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth2:
transmit timed out, sometimes this ata timeout doesn't yet occur and I
just get the netdev watchdog. This has not yet happened with the new
patch, though I'm only 1 hr into testing with it.
