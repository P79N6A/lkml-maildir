Can anyone recommend some decent 120 GB or larger IDE drives which don't
play these games?   
I'd like to build a reliable ~1 TB RAID 5 from IDE drives.  I will
gladly give up performance for high reliability and low cost.
My current 240 GB RAID 5 is built from five 60 GB Maxtor IDEs, with a
Reiser FS on it.  I use hdparm to disable write cache... unless Maxtor
ignores that?  Does anyone know?   I can check the exact model numbers
of the drives if it matters.
Is there documentation anywhere that says which drives cut corners?
Any other suggestions on how to build a cheap but reliable RAID?
Thanks in advance,
