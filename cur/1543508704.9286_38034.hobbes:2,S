Hi
I agree, too, because new hardware is often very buggy or instable itself. So
including drivers for the newest hardware will extend development time - in my
opinion - because you have to correct the new drivers a few times while hardware
is corrected.
Among the instability of new hardware will go the thought, that the kernel is
instable because of the bugs within biosses etc.
