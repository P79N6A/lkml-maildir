I'm not so sure, last week I had similar results with an external IEEE 1394
disk drive.  On the first attempt it wasn't detected, in the 2nd and 3rd
attempt detecting worked ok.  After copying a data for like 2min the system
paniced with no useful data in the log.  Further attempts resulted in more
hangs and panics.  The kernel was the latest and greatest FC3 kernel,
kernel-2.6.10-1.770_FC3.
(I'm a 1h flight away from the system so can't do any more testing on that
system)
