read_sockets_allocated is being invoked when when /proc/net/protocols is read,
which can be assumed as not frequent.  
At sk_stream_mem_schedule(), read_sockets_allocated() is invoked only 
certain conditions, under memory pressure -- on a large CPU count machine, 
you'd have large memory, and I don't think read_sockets_allocated would get 
called often.  It did not atleast on our 8cpu/16G box.  So this should be OK 
I think.
There're no 128 CPU Opteron boxes yet afaik ;).
Thanks,
