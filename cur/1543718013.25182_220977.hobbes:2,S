Subject: root fs on usb - is patching kernel still needed?

Hello,
I've been trying to boot Linux from an root fs which is on an usb-stick 
(kernel is on a bootdisk floppy).
Unfortunately, the kernel seems to try to mount the filesystem which is 
on an usb-stick too fast, before usb shows up for the kernel.
While reading this list I found several patches solving this problem, 
which wait a bit before root fs is mounted, which re-try in a loop to 
mount root fs etc.
Are there any solutions for this problem in stable or pre- kernel tree 
yet (2.4 or 2.6)? If not, will such a solution be ever included in a 
stable kernel?
Or maybe are there any easier solutions for this (some lilo or grub option?)
Regards,
Tomasz Chmielewski
