Looks good to me, shorter than my patch, has no duplication, allows to
use the storage, looks like a winner. Unfortunately, it leaves ub for dead,
because ub cannot invoke the necessary initializer unless we move it to
libusual. But oh well, I'll think about it.
Took me this long to test because I had to ask kind people in England
to replug the modem.
