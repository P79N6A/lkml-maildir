Hi All,
I am porting a driver from 2.4 to 2.6. I have replaced
the call devfs_register() with class_create() and
class_device_create(). Now, udev is automatically
creating the device file in /dev.
The device file being created has a default mode of
0600. Is it possible to override this default mode
from inside the kernel. I do not want to do anything
in the configuration file for udev.
I could modify the attribute of the class and the
class device but I do not think that they will change
the default permissions for the /dev device file.
devfs_register() used to take a mode argument.
So, is there anyway of achieving this in 2.6.
-Y
