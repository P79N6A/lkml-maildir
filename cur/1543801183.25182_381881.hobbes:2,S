Subject: heads up: Ubuntu Breezy GCC 4.0.2-prerelease miscompiles 2.6.15 with -Os

Hi,
For Ubuntu and perhaps other pre-release shipping distribution users:
If you get errors like:
# ip route add default via 10.0.0.12
RTNETLINK answers: Network is unreachable
for no good reason, and you can't delete any routes either, you may be
compiling your kernel optimized for size (CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE),
which is triggering a bug in your gcc 4.0.2 pre-release, or at a stretch, a
bug in the kernel.
The fix is to either turn off optimization for size ("-Os"), or to compile
with a real gcc 4.0.2 release and not a pre-release.
For more details see

http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-netdev&m=113641859718902&w=2 and
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=322723
I'll be heading to the ubuntu bug tracker to see if this problem is there
already.
Good luck!
