+1.  When MegaSAS driver receives reset call from OS, driver waits in reset
+routine for max 3 minutes for all pending command completion. Now driver will
+call completion routine every 5 seconds from the reset routine instead of
+waiting for cmd completion from isr path.

+
+i.	Replaced pci_alloc_consistent with dma_alloc_coherent in ioctl path
+ii.	eh_timed_out call back (megasas_reset_timer) is now used to throttle io to the
+	adapter when it is called the first time for a scmd.
+	The MEGASAS_FW_BUSY flag is set and can_queue reduced to 16. The can_queue is
+	restored from completion routine in following two conditions :
+	5 seconds has elapsed and the # of outstanding cmds in FW is < 17.
+	This implementation replaces the throttling mechanism of 3.08 ver.

+
+That's rather what worries me.  When the error handler activates (which
+it will on the first timeout), it waits for all commands to complete or
+time out before running.  Your reset handler does nothing other than
+wait for the firmware to complete the commands (now uselessly), so we
+now wait for the entire firmware command queue to drain, then you tell
+the mid layer everything is OK, so it loads you up again with all the
+commands plus a few test unit readies for good measure, then you
+throttle.
+
+You really want to catch the device going into this condition and do
+something at that point ... prime candidate would be lowering the
+can_queue depth to get fewer commands transiting the firmware.

+
+OK, this is still not nice.  What you need to be doing is intercepting
+the timeout before it fires (and quiesces the machine).  Currently the
+eh_timed_out() callback is only exposed to transport classes, I'll put
+it back into the host template and then you can use it.

+It looks like megaraid_sas at least needs this to throttle its commands
+as they begin to time out.  The code keeps the existing transport

+i.	Under heavy IO mid-layer prints "DRIVER_TIMEOUT" errors  
+
+	Fix:	The driver is now throttling IO.
+	Checks added in megasas_queue_command to know if FW is able to 
+	process commands within timeout period. If number of retries
+	is 2 or greater,the driver stops sending cmd to FW temporarily. IO is
+	resumed if pending cmd count reduces to 16 or 5 seconds has elapsed
+	from the time cmds were last sent to FW.
+
+ii.	FW enables WCE bit in Mode Sense cmd for drives that are configured 
+	as WriteBack. The OS may send "SYNCHRONIZE_CACHE" cmd when Logical
+	Disks are exposed with WCE=1. User is advised to enable Write Back
+	mode only when the controller has battery backup. At this time 
+	Synhronize cache is not supported by the FW. Driver will short-cycle 
+	the cmd and return sucess without sending down to FW.

+1. Added new memory management module to support the IOCTL memory allocation. For IOCTL we try to allocate from the memory pool created during driver initialization. If mem pool is empty then we allocate at run time.
+2. Added check in megasas_queue_command and dpc/isr routine to see if we have already declared adapter dead
+   (hw_crit_error=1). If hw_crit_error==1, now we donot accept any processing of pending cmds/accept any cmd from OS
