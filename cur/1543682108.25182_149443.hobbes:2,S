Ok, I've got those and I now have a modules.devfs...
I'm getting the impression that a bunch of modules have changed their names 
(i810_audio for example).
Even though I've changed (or I think I have) these module names in 
modprobe.conf I'm seeing failures for loading the old ones... Is something 
reading modules.conf that shouldn't?
Cheers,
Mark.
