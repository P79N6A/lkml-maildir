Agreed.

Well I can assure you that we are not dragging the towell in two different
directions - please see for example my notes about the ata_taskfile
function having too much parameters ;-).

No problem with me. I will just pull out the generally good stuff
out of it OK? I hope this will not make the tracking of the
alpha patches too difficult for you...

Well, there is *no question* you are capable to do this...

Yes I have noticed this as well. However let's wait and see
whatever maybe I'm able to save you the trobule and pull them
out myself. Your alpha patch is "interresting" enough to have me
a walk over it line by line anyway :-).
I have to catch up with 2.5.8-pre2 anyway, since apparently this
weekend was more about alcohol consumption for me then hacking...
