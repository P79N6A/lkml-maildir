Hi,
You said:
> Am i missing something here?
no, you are not missing anything except the temporary fix (not
mine, just happens to be on my site) available at:
http://www.ocston.org/~tigran/patches/other/bde-ramdisk-2.3.29-p1.patch
So, if you need the ramdisk urgently the above patch works fine but there
are possible conceptual problems (and also real problems if you use RAID
or put a high stress load on ramdisks) with it.
Regards,
