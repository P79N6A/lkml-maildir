A sponsored copy of the official spec. is long overdue...

For some reason, I get lots. :)
It's probably because I am the maintainer for the only two drivers for
hardware that is found in laptops. More average Joes in that market.
Like you, I unfortunately haven't got any of these cards for myself. But
I've gotten reports of both that "other" readers use 512 bytes[1],
regardless of WRITE_BL_LEN, and that cards that have WRITE_BL_LEN of
1024 and _not_ partial, still work just fine with 512 bytes[2].

I'll point people to your patch then and ask them to have you as a cc.
