	Ok, things are much clearer now :)
	But I still have some doubts..CC'ing LKML to see if any of those 
hackers can help us.

	Yeah, ok...but I still don't get when a dentry doesn't have a valid 
d_inode why we don't return ENOENT like in sys_unlink:
slashes:
         error = !dentry->d_inode ? -ENOENT :
                 S_ISDIR(dentry->d_inode->i_mode) ? -EISDIR : -ENOTDIR;
	Which, by the way, would be called _instead_ of calling vfs_unlink...so 
should we assume that the dentry _should_ have a valid dinode?
	You said that the kernel oops'ed when unlinking a symlink in a NFS 
partition, right?
	Does anybody know if, in this case (a symlink inside a NFS partition), 
the dentry really doesn't have a valid d_inode entry?
	Thanks,
Felipe
