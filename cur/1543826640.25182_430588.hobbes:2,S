I just completed some builds including the setup you
indicated (though not your exact .config, which I will try next).
I'm also building x86-64.
Everything builds correctly using your patch, but
without the Makefile portion, so we can drop that.
It builds for
CONFIG_HDLC=m
CONFIG_SYNCLINK=m
CONFIG_SYNCLINK_HDLC=y
(all modules)
and
CONFIG_HDLC=m
CONFIG_SYNCLINK=y
CONFIG_SYNCLINK_HDLC=y
(all built-in, hdlc promoted to 'y')
