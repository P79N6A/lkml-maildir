Hello,
This series of patches integrates msr.h header.
What it really does, is a series of steps to allow us
to get rid of duplicate code between i386 and x86_64 versions
With this done, achieving paravirt for x86_64 gets really easy,
just a couple of extra code.
The first patch was already sent a while ago, but was not yet pushed
to any tree , to my knowledge. So it is sent again. Also, 
patches 9 and 10 relies on b02f15537b3bf43e347214cf14bad80aeaef1caf,
already in the x86 tree.
Other than that, it should apply fine ontop of linus today git.
Comments are welcome
