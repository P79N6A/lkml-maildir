   int new_fd = sys_copy( int src_fd );  /* cloned copy, out of any fs */
   fchmod( new_fd, XXX_WHAT_EVER );      /* do the job. */
   ...
   flink(new_fd, "/some/path/some/file/name"); /* commit to fs */
   close(new_fd);  /* bye-bye */
   I beleive this can be more useful. Not only in naive tries to replace 
cp(1) with kernel ;-)
