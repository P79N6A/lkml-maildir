Hello, Al!
Sorry, forgot to copy to LKML.

Agreed.  See corrected patch below.  SUBARCH is not set when not
compiling for UML to avoid confusing but harmless output in Makefile
like
ARCH = arm
SUBARCH = i386
Actually, UML doesn't currently build outside the kernel tree because a
link to arch/um/Kconfig_arch is not created.  This will need a separate
fix.
I think SUBARCH ultimately should go to .config as a UML specific option
(but the build system will have to learn how to get default values from
the outside world).  Until then, I'm fine with saving SUBARCH.

I'm using such script now.  It's called kmake.  I keep forgetting to run
kmake instead of make, so it's an annoyance for me (usually it end up
with a full screen of error messages, but I'm afraid I could get a mix
of object files for different architectures in some cases).  Maybe the
wrapper should read .config?  I'll rather contribute some code to Linux
than to a local script.
I've been working with embedded systems for many years, and I know that
it's very common to patch the top-level Makefile to set ARCH and
CROSS_COMPILE.  It is done so that all developers working on the code
don't have to write wrappers and remember to use them every time.
Having ARCH and CROSS_COMPILE hardcoded in Makefile is inconvenient if
one wants to compile the same source for another architecture to verify
portability of the changes.  That's exactly where having a separate
build directory is handy.
I know, what is considered trivial for one person is an annoyance for
another.  What if Linux required to add arguments to the make command
line to enable SMP and preemption?  After all, one could put those
arguments to the wrapper as well.  It's convenient that we can configure
the kernel once and forget about every choice we made.  I want the same
for ARCH and CROSS_COMPILE settings.
