   Your patch is incorrect -- it causes the kernel to accept _less_ network
devices, not more. I really wonder why does it help.
   o  Do you really have recent 2.2.x kernel or it's some 2.1.xxx where the
      IPconfig code worked differently?
   o  Does specifying an explicit device name on the kernel command line
      (see Documentation/nfsroot.txt) help?
   o  Can you send me kernel messages printed when IPCONFIG_DEBUG is turned
      on (a #define in ipconfig.c)?
				Have a nice fortnight
