It is indeed a very good idea. The script could just spit out the
CFLAGS used for kernel compilation like this:
#! /bin/sh
cat <<EOF
-D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux-2.2.15/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -fno-strict-aliasing -pipe -fno-strength-reduce -m486 -malign-loops=2 -malign-jumps=2 -malign-functions=2 -DCPU=686 -DUTS_MACHINE='"i386"'
EOF
Then a module Makefile would be as simple as
# Set KVER manually if you want to compile against another kernel version
KVER=$(shell uname -r)
CFLAGS=$(shell /lib/modules/$(KVER)/kernel-config)
module.o: module.c module.h
I've tried this, it works.
Mike.
