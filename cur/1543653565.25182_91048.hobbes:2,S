Well, I have to disagree here.  "I have successfully finished my
initialization" is the same logic you're trying to beat into module
author's heads before they commit their interfaces.

Or, put another way, I'm trying to ensure that correct code in the
kernel is correct code in a module, by having the module code simulate
the conditions in which the original occurred.

Speaking of which, what's the long-term plan for hotplug events at
boot?  Will you get a shitload of "add" events, or rely on userspace
to scan?

Hmm, my audit of copy_to/from_user uncovered similar bogosities, and
I've dropped more than one Trivial Patch Monkey patches because they
cleaned up one case in an incurable sewer of problems 8(
The "better to have a bad driver than no driver" becomes less true as
people start copying from it, too.  This is where meta-maintainers
like Jeff Garzik make a definite difference as chief shit-kicker.

Perhaps.  But I can't change the world: that's your job.

Fervently agree: it's hard to get one line wrong, *and* almost any
scheme can be implemented on top of it.
