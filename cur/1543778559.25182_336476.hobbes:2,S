Subject: [PATCH] Fix incorrect Asus k7m irq router detection

Hi,
this patch:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=bk-commits-head&m=111955644929114&w=2
uncovered a k7m bios bug, where the VT82C686A router is reported as
being "586-compatible". The two chips have different pirq mapping, so
this leads to "irq routing conflict" on many pci devices.
The suggested fix was discussed with Aleksey Gorelov, who helped me
to identify the problem as a probable bios bug.
Patch for 2.6.13-git4.
