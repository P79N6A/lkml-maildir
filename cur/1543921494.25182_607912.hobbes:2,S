Euh, is these really necessary?
At work I have no problems running depmod on an i386 system for ppc64 modules
after I installed module-init-tools 3.3-pre2 (from Debian).
I did have problems (depmod SEGV) using the depmod that came with CentOS
4 (from module-init-tools 3.1-pre5).

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
