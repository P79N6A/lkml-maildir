Right, I meant to follow up and correct that - the caller has the
responsibility of detecting the short transfer and taking corrective
action, but on the other hand, maybe the caller always had that
responsibility.
But for the cases where the caller 'knows' it holds no locks, it's
better to oops if that's untrue as Rusty said, plus the inc/dec is
saved in that case.
