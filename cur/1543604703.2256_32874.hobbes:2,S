hello,
is anyone using a ASUS A7A266 without the clock timer configuration lost
messages?
so are there only some A7A266 board with this problem an replacing
the board could fix it - or do i just have to life with the bug and
a spammed syslog.

kernel: probable hardware bug: clock timer configuration lost - probably a
VIA686a motherboard.
kernel: probable hardware bug: restoring chip configuration.
