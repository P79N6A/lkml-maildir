My current version of the clone.2 manual page says
       CLONE_THREAD
              (Linux 2.4 onwards) If  CLONE_THREAD  is  set,  the
              child  is  placed  in  the same thread group as the
              calling process.  Now in 2.6 also  the  meaningless
              CLONE_DETACHED  (introduced in 2.5.32) must be set.
I wonder whether it is too late to remove CLONE_DETACHED entirely.
There are precisely two occurrences: the definition and the check
that it is set when CLONE_THREAD is set. Seems fairly useless.
