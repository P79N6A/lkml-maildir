Hi again, Andrew,
Besides the "make_KOBJ_NAME-match_BUS_ID_SIZE.patch" causing "pccard"
oopses, I've also found that, with 2.5.69-mm5 compiled with ACPI
support, my laptop is unable to power off. The kernel invokes
"acpi_power_off" and stays there forever.
I've found that reverting the "i8259-shutdown.patch" fixes the problem
and my laptop is able to shutdown properly (init 0) when using ACPI.
A hardware bug? A kernel bug?
Thanks!
