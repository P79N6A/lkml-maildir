Hi,

if what I suspect about MY problem is in fact true, then for your problem I'd 
try the following:
 - switch on APIC and IO-APIC support on uniprocessors in your kernel config
 - if there is such a setting, switch on APIC mode in your BIOS
 - see if this suffices (your dmesg output seems more sane than mine)
If the problem doesn't go away, try the patch at the top of my mail. If it 
still doesn't work, well, I might be completely wrong, or you might also be 
suffering from BIOS and/or DSDT problems, but I'm even more out of my depth 
there than with the issue I saw...
Good luck,
Daniel.
