Hi all,
this is the new release of UidBind LSM:
http://projects.unbit.it/uidbind/
This new version adds a new configfs item, named 'comm'
If 'comm' is defined only the process with name == comm 
can call the bind() function 
(see the example on the website)
A patch for vanilla 2.6.21 is available on the website
