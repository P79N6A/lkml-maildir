I'd rather say we don't guarantee there will be one anymore after 2.6.<next>.2
is out.  First we need to provide it a little longer because .0 isn't alwaysas
stable as we want, second people will fix up older releases when they are
used as base kernel for distributions, and there's no point of not marking it
official if it is there.
