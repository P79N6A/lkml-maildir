setjmp.S was stolen from klibc, and I'd just as soon leave it alone and
not try to customize it for UML.  That file will disappear if/when klibc 
is in mainline, and I can just pull it in from usr.
In general, there's no reason that regparam can't be used for UML.  However,
in the past (I don't know if it's still a problem) gcc miscompiled regparam
code in the presence of -pg.
As for why it's not, I don't see any occurences of regparam in include/linux
or include/asm-i386 either.

Probably not.
