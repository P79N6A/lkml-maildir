They definitely will be affected when they lock their system

The graphics engine would not react kindly, and it does not really hurt.

Yes, I am a bit paranoid. That paranoia led to the discovery of some bugs
nobody knew or cared about. But you are right, this check might be a bit too
paranoid.

Well, you are shure that there is really not a single bug left in the 
bitmap construction
code? And that the code will never be touched again because it already 
is optimal? I
think support for all alignment possibilities will be handy in the near 
future, and
although it could be hidden by an #ifdef or stay a private patch, I 
prefer to include it.
Currently bitmap construction takes longer than blitting the image to 
the screen with
cyblafb, and I think I will have a very close look at that code soon.
BTW, something fundamental: Isn´t the pixelmap alignment really a 
property of the
image bitmap like the depth of the image data?

Do you really think that this is a good idea? I would like to ease the 
use of
e.g. fbset in scripts by returning -EINVAL when something as fundamental as
the selected xres is not acceptable. Ok, it´s always possible to parse 
the output
of fbset -s  in those cases.

Yes. That saves a few bytes.

No, no, no, no.
