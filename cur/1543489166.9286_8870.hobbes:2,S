   Actually, you should fsck the disk that the file resides on. You
   shouldn't _ever_ need to debugfs an ext2 filesystem to remove a
   damaged file -- fsck should be able to fix it for you. 
This is true in principle, but if you're using an older e2fsck
(i.e. versions 2.13 or below), there are some cases where e2fsck won't
automatically deal with certain forms of filesystem corruption,
particular ones where the inode table gets garbage scribbled onto it.
In those cases, you will need to upgrade to e2fsprogs 2.14, or use
debugfs and manually clri the "undeletable" inodes.
