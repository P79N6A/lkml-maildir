Depends of what around means.
+	result = down_interruptible(sem);
+	del_timer(&dit_timer);
+	if (result < 0 && data.result < 0)
+		result = data.result;
This piece of code will catch the 'timeout arrived right before a 
signal' case. 'data.result' is set by the timeout handler, so it 
doesn't interfere.
Now, if the timeout arrives right after a signal was delivered
but before the thread returns from down_interruptible, then it
will also look like a timeout (as that code in the if statement
will kick in) -- to some extent, it is 'right' theoretically, as
it didn't get the sem before the time expired. TIF_SIGPENDING is 
still set, so the signal is not lost (unless I miss something else
about the signal delivery engine).
The last case, if the timeout arrives after the signal and after
down_interruptible returns, nothing in theory. There is a window
where the timer could still execute before it is deleted and it
would look like a timeout [which theoretically could be right too].
Maybe the result < 0 && data.result < 0 check should be done 
before del_timer(). 
Suggestions?
