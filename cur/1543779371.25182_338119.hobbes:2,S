The oscillations are indeed discouraging.  For S3 sleep/wake on my TP
600X:
2.6.11.4        : works well (the console was hosed with jittering text, but
                  X restores fine), which hugely improved using my laptop.
2.6.12.3        : ditto
But:
2.6.13-rc3      : goes to sleep but hangs when waking up
      -rc3-mm2  : same
      -rc3-mm3  : same
      -rc4-git3 : same
With those 2.6.13 variants, once it has hung, the power switch will
turn it off, but to turn it on I first have to unplug the power and
remove both batteries.
On the good side, swsusp seems to be improving with later kernel
versions.  No luck with 2.6.11.4; reasonable luck with 2.6.12.3; and
good results with 2.6.13*.
