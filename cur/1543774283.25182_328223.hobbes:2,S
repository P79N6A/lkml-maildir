This does not solve the problem that I reported last thursday where the 
fourth port of a e1000 quad card doesn't work under SMP (I don't know if 
it was supposed to, but since it was a locking fix I had hopes).
here's the symptom I am seeing

There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.
