Did you apply the pending/submitted patches from patch-o-matic?
There's a known bug in conntrack in kernel 2.4.20 that can make old
connections still hang around. It's fixed in the latest 2.4.21-pre
kernel.
Or you can download patch-o-matic and patch your 2.4.20 kernel.
(
ftp://ftp.netfilter.org/pub/patch-o-matic/snapshot/patch-o-matic-20030410.tar.bz2
)
And then execute ./runme --batch pending
And there's an entry about this problem with MASQUERADE and old
connection hanging around in the netfilter bugzilla, it's not
neccessarily the same bug as the one that's fixed in later kernels.
