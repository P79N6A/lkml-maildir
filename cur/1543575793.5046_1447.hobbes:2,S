I do the following....
sudo modprobe iptable_nat
Module                  Size  Used by
iptable_nat            17440   0 (unused)
ip_conntrack           19808   1 [iptable_nat]
ip_tables              12320   3 [iptable_nat]
Oops start flying by when I access via NFS.
If you need the actual Oops messages we're gonna have to get someone
