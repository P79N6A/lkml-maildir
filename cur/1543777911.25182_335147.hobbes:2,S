Hello,
I have bridge firewall (linux box) with three fast ethernet cards (one
rtl8139 for management and two e100 for bridge). It is running 2.4.31
kernel and iptables v1.2.11. It works ok about one month. Few weeks
ago It started ooopsing. First thought was hardware, but it was
replaced with a new one and problem still exist. I'm attaching 
ksymoops analysis of ooops message. I hope I'll help.
Some facts:
Traffic over this bridge is about ~30 MBit/sec and every frame is
tagged with VID (802.1q). Problem exist also on 2.4.30 kernel.
Kernel is patched with ebtables patch. Ooops completeley freezes
machine, only hard reset takes effect. Nothing is placed into syslog.
The ksymooops analisis is attached as text file.
Anyone know this bug/problem ?
Regards,
Lukasz Spaleniak
