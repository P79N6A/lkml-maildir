Well, the EDD module belongs to Matt Domsch.  I only contributed the
"legacy_*" code and names.
If it is OK with Matt, I agree we should rename legacy_heads to
legacy_max_head and legacy_sectors to legacy_sectors_per_track.  I
doubt anybody other than myself is using these yet anyway.

I used hex for legacy_* because that is what all the other fields
already used.  It was not my decision, and I have no opinion either
way.  Convince Matt.
