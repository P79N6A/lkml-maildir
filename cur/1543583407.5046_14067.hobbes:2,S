We have the same trouble on PPC but we make sure to re-sync on each
interrupt.  We can see several lost timer interrupts after a ^L in emacs
running on the fb console.  The resync lets us catch up on those interrupts
(and not lose time) but we still spend a lot of time not servicing
interrupts.
Does x86 not resync on timer interrupts?

} The kernel blocks interrupts during console output.  fbdev
} consoles are slow.  Net result: many lost timer interrupts.

} I'm working on it.  Slowly.  Should have something next week.
