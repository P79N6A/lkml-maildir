What brand/model? What chipset does the card use? Are your sure it's
PCMCIA (16-bit) and not CardBus (32-bit)?

Uh? A patch to make the pipe (|) symbol work?

Have you upgraded to latest modutils package? Modules are implemented
quite differently in 2.6.

You don't need that.

It seems the kernel is having problems assigning resources to your card.
Plase, edit "/etc/pcmcia/config.opts" and uncomment the following line:
#include port 0x1000-0x17ff

I suggest you to recompile your kernel with ACPI support to see if it
works correctly. Else, recompile it disabling ACPI support and enabling
APM support.

You can remove APIC support from your config. It's not supported by your
hardware.

Please, add "pci=usepirqmask" to your kernel command line in GRUB/Lilo.
