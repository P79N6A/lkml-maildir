I've seen this and similar advice for other problems, and have disabled 
ecn for several systems with networking ailments myself. Would it be 
better to have some of these off by default rather than have multiple 
versions of these problems appear into the future? Is there some common 
case where these not only work but provide a significant benefit so 
great it justifies being the default?
