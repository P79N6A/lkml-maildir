Hi All,
What is x86emu?
---------------
The x86emu project is an emulator for executing x86 real mode code on 
any CPU platform, including the x86 CPU family. The emulator started 
out as the free equivalent to the Digital Equipment x86 emulator in 
the Linux MILO loader. Since then the emulator has been updated to 
include support for 32-bit real mode instructions, and optimised for 
better performance, and should be able to completely replace the 
Digitial Equipment proprietry emulator in MILO.
This emulator has lots of different of uses on Linux and other 
platforms. Some of those include:
 . Ability to POST multi-head graphics controller configurations on 
   x86 using the existing adapter BIOS.
 . Ability to POST the primary controller on non-x86 platforms to 
   bring it up into text mode for Linux.
 . Ability to provide the Linux VBE framebuffer console driver with 
   the capabilities to call the BIOS on any number of controllers at
   runtime. This will allow it to switch graphics modes on the fly,
   program the hardware palette etc. On VBE/Core 3.0 adapters, this
   also includes full refresh rate control out of the box!
The current maintainer of the x86emu project is Kendall Bennett 
(KendallB@scitechsoft.com). The emulator is licensed under the GNU 
General Public License (GPL), with the library exception clause 
included (ie: you can link the library with non-GPL'ed code).
