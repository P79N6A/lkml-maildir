It should be possible to replace the Alcatel management application using
code from the user space speedtouch driver project
(see 
http://speedtouch.sourceforge.net
).  Of course the firmware uploaded
to the modem would still be closed source, but no closed source program
would run on the computer.  Since the module is open-source (GPL) there
is no problem adding the appropriate licence symbol to it, avoiding the "tainted"
problem.
All the best, Duncan.
