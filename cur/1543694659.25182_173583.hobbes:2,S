See "6.21 Device Configuration Overlay feature set" in 
the ATA6 spec...
"The optional Device Configuration Overlay feature set allows a
utility program to modify some of the optional commands, modes,
and feature sets that a device reports as supported in the
IDENTIFY DEVICE or IDENTIFY PACKET DEVICE command response as
well as the capacity reported."
