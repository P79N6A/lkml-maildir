Hmm. I was having problems reproducible with
CONFIG_ALPHA_LARGE_VMALLOC n.
Enabling the large vmalloc was my work around, because the large
vmalloc whet back to the prelazy allocation code.
I was getting repeatable problems inside of an mtd driver.  The
problem I had was entries failed to propagate across different tasks.
I think it was something like the first pgd was lazily allocated and
not propagated.   
I don't have a SRM on my 264 alpha so alpha (for reference on which
code paths were followed.

Well racy is easier to work with than just plain non-functional.
