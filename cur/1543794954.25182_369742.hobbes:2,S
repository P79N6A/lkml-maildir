Can't see anything yet. Sysrq-M would be good. cat /proc/zoneinfo gets you
most of the way there though.
A couple of samples would be handy, especially from /proc/vmstat.
cat /proc/vmstat > vmstat.out ; sleep 10 ; cat /proc/vmstat >> vmstat.out
The same for /proc/zoneinfo would be a good idea as well.
Also - when you say "too much cpu time", what does this mean? Does
performance noticably drop compared with 2.6.13 performing the same cron
job? Because kswapd is supposed to unburden other processes from page
reclaim work, so if it is working *properly*, then the more CPU it uses
the better.
Thanks,
Nick
