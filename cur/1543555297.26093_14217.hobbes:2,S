Subject: i82365 PCI-PCMCIA bridge still not working in 2.4.0-test11

Hi,
Installed kernel 2.4.0-test11 on my Debian Woody box today. Had no 
problem apart from getting PCMCIA to work. I have a PCI-PCMCIA adapter 
on my desktop PC, using the Cirrus Logic CL6729 chipset; on a 2.2.x 
kernel it is detected as an i82365 and works accordingly.
After trying 2.4.0-test9 and -test10 (which don't support i82365), it 
was nice to see that test11-pre6 finally has regained PCMCIA support... 
so it's weird to encounter this problem. Has anyone managed to use the 
i82365 kernel module?
relevant kernel config:
PCMCIA support compiled as a module
i82365 as a module
CardBus (yenta_socket) as a module
Attached are the result of running /etc/init.d/pcmcia start and the 
error message from dmesg
Any help appreciated... and looking forward to test12... or will it be 
2.4.0-final, finally?
:)
Regards,
Michel Salim
