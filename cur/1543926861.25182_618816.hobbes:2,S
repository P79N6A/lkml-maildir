Micah,
ok, would it be possible to get "cat /proc/schedstat" output at the
moment when you observe the 'problem'? So we could try to analyze
behavior of the load balancer (yeah, we should have probably started
with this step)
something like this:
(the problem appears)
# cat /proc/schedstat
... wait either a few seconds or until the problem disappears
(whatever comes first)
# cat /proc/schedstat
TIA,
