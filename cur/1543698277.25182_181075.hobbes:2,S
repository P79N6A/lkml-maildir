Using laptop mode for the first time. Kernel is 2.4.23-Vanilla+kdb4.3 on a x86 notebook.
IDE Disk is ext3 mounted with rw,noatime
# cat /proc/sys/vm/laptop_mode
1
# cat /proc/sys/vm/bdflush
30      500     0       0       60000   60000   60      20      0
- Any disk write access spins up and writes as usual after 5 seconds by kjournald
- A disk spinup by kjournald does _not_ run bdflush and kupdated, so once they 
  elapse, the disk spins up again
This part of the laptop-mode patch is missing and the 5 second interval is still hardcoded:

IMHO, without this patch, laptop-mode is only half as useful ;)
Why was this part of the patch not used?
