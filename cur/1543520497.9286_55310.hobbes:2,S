A s/__SMP__/CONFIG_SMP/ patch ignores all the subtle places where
__SMP__ is defined and CONFIG_SMP would not be.  I agree, however,
with the need for CONFIG_SMP everywhere.  It also would be nice
to fix the -DMODVERSIONS and -include "modversions.h"
Are there any good gcc tricks that would make the __SMP__->CONFIG_SMP
migration patch easier?
