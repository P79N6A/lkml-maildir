I use vmstat and top together to determine if a system is (too) busy or
not.
vmstat gives a good indication about the amount of disk IO (both regular
IO and swap), and top sorted by cpu or memory shows which processes are
responsible for the numbers.
You as a human can interpret what you see. I don't think software should
do anything with the load average, as it does not reflect the actual
usage of the hardware.
