Some uses of O_NONE (or "O_NOACCESS", as it's called sometimes) are in
avoiding access to a device (read-ahead, media detection, etc.) for
which we want to send ioctls:
 - setfdprm: the driver may not know how to read the disk before the
   ioctls are done
 - fdformat: for obvious reasons
 - LILO: fetch geometry data, even if the media is not around
Particularly fdformat is a good test if O_NONE still works :-)
BTW, O_NONE is about as old as Linux. Maybe we should eventually add it
to asm/fcntl.h, to avoid the regular threads on its feasibility ;-)
