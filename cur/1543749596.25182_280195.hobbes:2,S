As a long-term solution, this obviously won't work, but I think it's a 
_very_ good solution for now. UB _is_ expiramental at this point. It 
still has it's issues, and per Pete is still not to be used unless you 
really know what you're doing.
That makes it expiramental to me.

This is decent  idea. Some "Warning: UB enabled - your usb-storage 
devices may not work properly!" type thing on loading can't hurt.
Not the cleanest thing in the world, but look how well it worked for the 
unusual_devs cleanups.
