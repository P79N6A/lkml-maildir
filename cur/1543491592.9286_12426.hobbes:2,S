...as well as with 2.2.5 and 2.2.5-ac1.
Both kernels were compiled with egcs 1.1.2 with -mpentium instead of
the default -m486.
I'll fetch gcc 2.7.2 and report what happens with that version later
(the deadlock occurs after a few minutes up to a few hours...).
When the deadlock occurs, the console-cursor keeps blinking as usual,
but none of the Scroll-Lock combos nor other keyboard activity gives
any response.
