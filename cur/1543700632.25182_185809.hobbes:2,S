Hi Christoph,
You are ofcourse talking about linux/drivers/.. right?
IP27 is not a supported architecture under linux/arch/ia64/sn/io/..
The IP27 MIPS processor/io hardware(bridge/Xbridge)/BIOS for IP27 are very much
different than our SN2 product, supported within the linux/arch/ia64 tree -
ia64 processors, IO Chipsets(PIC, TIO(CP,CA)), and System BIOS.
Is that not supported under the linux/arch/mips tree?
Happy Holidays all.
