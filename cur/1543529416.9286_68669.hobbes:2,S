I respectfully disagree ;-)
Consider the case where parport_pc and serial (and perhaps other
devices) register the same motherboard PCI device...   I have already
hacked parport_pc to do motherboard detection of Via 686A parallel
ports, and plan to do the same for serial module and the motherboard
serial ports -- both of which are matched using the same PCI
vendor/device id.
