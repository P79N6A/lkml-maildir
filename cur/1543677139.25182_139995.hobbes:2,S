I think the chances are even. Buy were you get best value for money. I
bought the TM1400 and swapped it for now with a TM1150 sparepart (it's
not quite expensive). 
Also a Orinico based PC-card is available for down to 50 EUR out there.
That would work until a driver is available.

A programmer is a person who passes as an exacting expert on the basis of
being able to turn out, after innumerable punching, an infinite series of
incomprehensible answers calculated with micrometric precisions from vague
assumptions based on debatable figures taken from inconclusive documents
and carried out on instruments of problematical accuracy by persons of
dubious reliability and questionable mentality for the avowed purpose of
annoying and confounding a hopelessly defenseless department that was
unfortunate enough to ask for the information in the first place.
