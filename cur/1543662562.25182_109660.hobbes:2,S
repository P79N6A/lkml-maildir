Uhhhhh. They should timeout though and then be counted as errors; hard to
catch this differently.
You are saying it doesn't work?

Yes. We intentionally don't do active _monitoring_ on non-active paths, same
as we don't do reprobing of failed paths to see whether they are alive again.
(The LVM m-p patch does periodically send down live requests to failed paths
to check this; I consider this intentional data corruption, but I'm
paranoid.)
This is something which can easily be implemented safely in user-space
though; the md approach still exposes the lower level devices and you can
check them periodically if you care, and be it with a 
	while sleep 1 ; do
		if ! dd if=/dev/sdaX of=/dev/null ; then
			mdadm /dev/md0 --fail /dev/sdaX
			logger -p kern.alert "Path /dev/sdaX failed!"
		fi
	done
;-) Obviously, not something we need to run in kernel space.

Indeed. Yes, we'll need to figure out how to do this for 2.5/2.6; maybe
porting forward the md m-p patch to 2.5 is indeed the best choice. It should
be way easier, as md has been greatly cleaned up...
However, past discussions on LKML regarding "How to do m-p cleanly in 2.5"
have never reached a conclusion ;-) We'll see. The good thing about the SCSI
m-p is that it can also handle multipathed tape drives...
