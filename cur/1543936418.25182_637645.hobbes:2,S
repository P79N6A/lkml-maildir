And this is a problem if the rate control algorithm often sets the rate to
more than 11M even if connection is unreliable at that rate. Does this
actually happen? Are you currently using 'pid'?
Also, it would be fine to have a dump of the PID events. In order to get
this, you need to:
- build a kernel with debugfs enabled;
- mount debugfs (mount -t debugfs foo /mnt/debug)
Then, before testing:
cat /mnt/debug/ieee80211/phy0/stations/*/rc_pid_events > events_dump
You can even make a graph out of that, with a python script which Mattias
posted on this list some time ago, but a dump would be just fine.
