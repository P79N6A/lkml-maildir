Yes, a zsync-like protocol ought to be doable. But you'll still
potentially be doing 16k requests to pull something the size of the
kernel, which isn't very friendly to a web server. So I'm working on a
stand-alone or possibly CGI-based replacement.
My goal is to do something like this:
client                             server
I last saw change N from you 
                                   W, X, Y, and Z are newer here
Send me X, Y, and Z relative to N
                                   Here you go, deltas from N to X to
				   Y to Z, sorted by file
So not only can we be efficient in number of round trips and data
transferred, we can reduce seeks by applying all per-file changes together.
We can also usually avoid decompress/recompress and patch/diff because
both ends will end up storing the same delta.
