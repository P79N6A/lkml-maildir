Hello,
I see quite strange behavior of subj.
socket(PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_IP) = 40
fcntl(40, F_GETFL)                      = 0x2 (flags O_RDWR)
fcntl(40, F_SETFL, O_RDWR|O_NONBLOCK)   = 0
setsockopt(40, SOL_SOCKET, SO_LINGER, [1], 8) = 0
connect(40, {sin_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(2030), 
sin_addr=inet_addr("127.0.0.1")}}, 16) = -1 EINPROGRESS (Operation now in 
progress)
select(41, NULL, [40], NULL, {180, 0})  = 1 (out [40], left {180, 0})
getsockopt(40, SOL_SOCKET, SO_ERROR, [0], [4]) = 0
select(41, [40], NULL, NULL, {180, 0})  = 1 (in [40], left {175, 550000})
ioctl(4, FIONREAD, [0])                 = 0
select(41, [40], NULL, NULL, {180, 0})  = 1 (in [40], left {180, 0})
recv(4, 0x806aa28, 1, 0x4000)           = -1 EAGAIN (Resource temporarily 
unavailable)
As far as you can see select say that socket is writable after connect. This 
mean that connection is completed... But later before read we do select on 
read, and get OK. But recv fails with EAGAIN. This situation is repeated 
constantly. The program stucks in the loop trying to connect, but fails.
Any ideas what can this be?
Maybe comment from Alan, as RH employee?
As a side comment. Server is highly loaded. The program usually works well, 
but if it happend once, it will repeat forever...
