No disagreements - but I don't think that a watchdog that doesn't cause a 
reset is a periodic timer.

Agreed again - periodic timers have nothing to do with watchdogs. This is 
where I am confused about why you are saying that the only event a watchdog 
can have is a hard reset.

I did. Twice - but maybe I am still missing something. (sorry)

I (and many others) consider a "watchdog" a clock sink - something that needs 
to be poked within certain limits (too fast can indicate a failures just as 
too slow is a failure).
The event or how something is notified of the failure of the watchdog to be 
serviced shouldn't determine what the name is.
    What's in a name? that which we call a watchdog
    By any other name would smell as sweet;
