Amen.
Helleluja.
Listen to the man.
Please don't play games with "ide_outb()" etc, which cause 99% of the
architectures to have to make the 1:1 translation to just "outb()", and
which also makes it incredibly cumbersome to handle multiple _different_
controllers that just happen to use different schemes.
Instead, making the virtualization at a higher point means that you can
have _one_ set of common operations for traditional PCI/ATA controllers
(and that one set uses inx/outx/readx/writex), and then you have a few
others for the "strange" cases.
And done properly with per-controller (or drive - you may want to
virtualize at the drive level just because you could separate out
different kinds of drive accesses that way too) function pointers you can
then _mix_ access methods, without getting completely idiotic run-time
checks inside "ide_out()".
