IMHO a UID mapping is completely the wrong solution for this.  The  
problem is the the subject (the process) and object (the filesystem)  
place different meanings on different UIDs, in other words their UIDs  
are in different namespaces.  The result is that you should tag that  
filesystem (vfsmount, really) with a different namespace tag and fix  
the namespace system to properly handle cross-namespace permissions,  
not forcibly graft on some fragile mapping system.  By using the  
keyring system for foreign-namespace UID permissions the actual  
permissions fall out quite nicely.
