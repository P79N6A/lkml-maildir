Hey Roman, 
Ok, well, I'm still at a loss for understanding how this avoids my
concern about time inconsistencies. However, I don't want to burn any
more of your patience explaining it, so in the hopes making some
productive outcome, I'm going to take a step back, pull the most trivial
and uncontroversial cleanups and fixes in my patches and try to send
them to Andrew one by one.
Hopefully that will give me a chance to spend some time and understand
your suggestions (or maybe allow someone else to express your
suggestions differently) and think of alternate solutions without
feeling like I'm constantly running into walls.
Again, I really do appreciate the time you've spent giving me feedback.
thanks
