No. "fs" is the name of a filesystem.
I think this might be a better idea than the name of a mountpoint as it would
then be possible to set the tokens prior to mounting, maybe so that you _can_
mount.
I'm thinking a bit of samba here, where authentication information needs to be
passed upon mounting (workstation/domain, username, password).
