i agree with the latency observation. But ext3 got two significant
performance boosts recently, at two ends of the performance spectrum:
- in the (lots-of-)small-files area: the addition of the htree feature
- in the large-files-throughput case: with the addition of the
  reservation feature.
ext3 installed by a recent distro should have both features enabled. (i
know for sure that Fedora Core 3 with the update/erratum kernel
installed will create ext3 filesystems that utilize both of these
features by default.) 
I encourage everyone to try the famous 'create and read 1 million small
files' test on both recent ext3 and on other filesystems.
