udev and module-init-tools fits nicely with the kernel. I never have
understood this 'keep-everyhig-separate' mantra. Just see how many
people had troubles with missing module-init-tools or people having
troubles with non-backward compatible udev.

So part of what you ask for is a set of incremental patches that shows
all the kernal modifications?
That should be doable with some effort but unfortunately I'm not up to
the task.
