Can you explain a bit what this is about and what the effect is? It's just 
that we've been using the driver (older version from the areca website) in a 
PAE kernel on machines with 8G of memory and haven't had a problem yet 
(running high IO load for several weeks) but this sounds like it 
might/should cause corruption or crashing in this situation?
