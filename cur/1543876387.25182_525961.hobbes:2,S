Subject: [PATCH 06/16] isofs-add-write-bit.diff
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Add %S_IWUGO bit for isofs. Makes it easier to poke on files after
they have been copied from an ISO-9660 filesystem because they are
ofte copied in `cp -p` or perhaps `rsync -p` mode.
They are still not writable though, and isofs will continue to
correctly return -EROFS for writes.
