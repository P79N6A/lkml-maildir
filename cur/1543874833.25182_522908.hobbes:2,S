I really can't comment more on these... you understand that in that case 
i would give away some interesting
security details... ;) But i tell you that things have evolved, i am 
even suprised to see these pieces of hardware
work against lots (i mean lots) of kinds of attacks. If you search a 
little you will find lots of hardware security
solutions on the market. Of course having the money to obtain them is 
another issue. Of course it also needs
a lot of paperwork and NDAs

RAM will be restricted, we try to do the best we can on filesystem.

Well in our design the most HOT data will be inside chips that you need 
serious equipment (and money)
to tamper with. But these have our own OS running. Even if someone 
breaks the signed modules system he can do
damage but not to such an extent. We understand that this is not 
unbreakable (yes, no assumed super-security) ,
but we need to do it as hard as we can for others to intrude.
This is going to work as the first security-barrier.
Well with quantum, RSA will be obsolete. Also elliptic curve is now 
becoming more and more popular
But the RSA is nowadays in common use, ranging from payment systems to 
the military. It will take some years
for this to change
Thanks for your interest and usefull comments
