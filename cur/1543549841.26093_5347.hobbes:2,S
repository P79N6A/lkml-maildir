Haven't tested it yet, but just reading over the patch - in ext2_lookup():
        if (dentry->d_name.len > UFS_MAXNAMLEN)
                return ERR_PTR(-ENAMETOOLONG)
should probably be changed back to:
        if (dentry->d_name.len > EXT2_NAME_LEN)
                return ERR_PTR(-ENAMETOOLONG)
Cheers, Andreas
