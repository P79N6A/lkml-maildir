But it's not specific to X11; I've applied the patch you posted and the
same symptoms occur for pure tty switching as well, the delay has decreased
a bit (it's hard to measure, but around a second), but it's still rather
annoying to work with.
Is it distinguishable which M6 models are buggy? I'm using my X31 for about
a year now and have probably made some tens of thousands of switches without
lockups, so presumably not all models cause lockups.
