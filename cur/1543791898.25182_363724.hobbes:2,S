Generally, it's better to put these forward struct declarations right at
the top of the header file (after the nested includes).
Because if someone comes along later and adds some code which uses
mm_struct at line 300, he's going to say a rude word and then add a second
forward declaration at line 299, and we end up with two of them.  Or he's
more awake and he just moves your declaration.  Either way, putting it at
the top of the file eliminates the problem.
A followup patch sometime would be nice..
