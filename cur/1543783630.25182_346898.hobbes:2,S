Once the infrastructure is there, I'll probably add support for several 
controllers myself.  Many controllers don't have an explicit hotplug 
interrupt, but rather we must examine the PhyRdy bit in the standard 
SError register for details.  If the bit's state changes in any way 
(including two or more state changes), we (a) check for device presence, 
and (b) if device is present, initialize it (SET FEATURES - XFER MODE, 
etc.).
