The code is in arch/x86/kernel/acpi/wakeup_32.S
. acpi_copy_wakeup_routine needs to know offsets within 16-bit 
code. I'd like to somehow call code from arch/x86/boot/video*.c
... current version just took (old) .S code, and cut&paste-s it.

I only need arch/x86/boot/video*.c ...

I need to access data in that 16-bit code...
