What about the sort of thing that crosses all archs?  For example, the
local_t changes?  Particularly in the case where the change has to be
made in generic code and in all archs at the same time, it makes sense
to me for you to send the whole batch to Linus at the same time,
rather than individual arch maintainers all sending their bit at
varying times.
Paul.
