As long as the variable doesn't get overflowed you would have a negation, you
shouldn't do dri_data[5] = ptr->dri * 0xff; if ptr->dri it's 255, but if
ptr->dri = 1 i.e. (like is set in zr36050_setup) then you would be getting
the negation, -1. the Direct rendering support is a flag afaik, so in this
case I believe is a worthy C obfuscated negation code :)
btw, are you sure about this patch?I would contact the maintainer first,
because and'ing that doesn't make much sense...
Disclaimer, all this is: AFAIK! :)
