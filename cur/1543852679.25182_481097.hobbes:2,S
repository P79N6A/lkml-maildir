Um, does this mean you expect us to change all of the currently existing
sysfs file names?  And people get mad at me when I just move sysfs
symlinks around...
Look at the hwmon drivers, and the documentation in
Documentation/hwmon/sysfs-interface for a description of how we have
been documenting this already.
In short, I don't really think we need to encode the units in the file
name, somehow we have done pretty well without it so far :)
