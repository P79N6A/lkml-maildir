my pre-condition is that the TTY device has no parent and then we move
it to a Bluetooth ACL link as child. This however is not working or the
TTY change to use device instead of class_device has broken something.

Cornelia, please fix this, because otherwise we can't detach a device
from its parent. Storing the current virtual parent looks racy to me.
