I did 7 data sets of 5 runs each using this method. With pipe-test
bound to one sibling, there were 10 unique values in these 7 sets. The
lowest value was 9.22, the highest value was 9.62, and the median of
the unique values was 9.47. So the deviation from mean for the lowest
and highest values was {-0.25, 0.15} The numbers were even tighter for
pipe-test not bound to a single sibling: {-0.07, 0.12}
