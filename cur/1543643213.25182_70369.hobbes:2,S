The same happened with NL.linux.org a while ago.
The basic problem with spamcop is that it ISN'T driven by
tests, but by complaints.
It is an automatic system for handling spam complaints and
will automagically list any system it gets too many complaints
about.  Regardless of whether the complaints are legitimate.

Spamcop is useful as part of a scoring system, but absolutely
unsuitable for outright mail rejection.
