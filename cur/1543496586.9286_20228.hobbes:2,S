Agreed.

If another CPU got the lock while we was in copy_from/to_user or in clear
page it means that we are been right releasing the lock. The problem
according to me is when we release the lock and there wasn't another CPU
that will reaquire it fast. If the code that will run is very fast then
we'll have less probabilty to scale and we risk to release the kernel lock
without really improve the other CPU.
BTW, in general there are only two lock sequence on the bus in the case
the spinlock failed the fast path. 1 lock if the spinlock got the fast
path.

Ah sys_bdflush() doesn't check for need_resched. Really here my
sys_bdflush doesn't run in O(N-buffers) but it should stay close to O(1),
but better to put a need_resched check in uptime anyway.
