I've just packaged up the latest Linux hotplug scripts into a release,
which can be found at:
	
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=17679
This release adds ieee1394 support and a try at SuSE support :)
Here's the full changelog:
	- Added ieee1394.agent from Kristian Hogsberg
	  <hogsberg@users.sourceforge.net>
	- with docs, "sh -x" debug support, minor fix.  Needs kernel
	  2.4.10 and modutils 2.4.9 to hotplug.
	- Some of the updates from SuSE:
		* add/use debug_msg macro in hotplug_functions
		modprobe -s (to syslog)
		* various agent tweaks/fixes
		* more usb.handmap entries (from usbmgr)
	- Added the fxload program
	- Rework root makefile and hotplug.spec to install in prefix
	  location without need of spec file for install.
	- Added installation directions to make the /var/run/usb
	  directory, and updated the rpm spec file to match.
	- added half of Stephen Williams <steve@icarus.com> REMOVER
	  patch. It is up to the install script to create the
	  /var/run/usb directory.  Something like the following would be
	  enough:
	  	mkdir /var/run/usb
		chmod 0700 /var/run/usb
Thanks,
greg k-h
