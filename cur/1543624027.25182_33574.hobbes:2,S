Subject: BUG REPORT: kernel nfs between 2.4.19-pre2 (server) and 2.2.21-pre3 (client)

Hello all,
I just upgraded a host from 2.2.19 to 2.2.21-pre3 and discovered a problem with kernel nfs. Setup is this:
knfs-server is 2.4.19-pre2
knfs-client is 2.2.21-pre3
First mount some fs (mountpoint /backup). Then go and mount some other fs from the same server (mountpoint /mnt), do some i/o on the latter and umount it again. Now try to access /backup. You see:
1) /backup (as a fs) vanished, you get a stale nfs handle.
2) umount /backup; mount /backup does not work. client tells "permission denied". server tells "rpc.mountd: getfh failed: Operation not permitted"
Only solution: restart nfs-server (no reboot required), then everything works again.
Same setup works with 2.2.19-client.
Any hints?
Regards,
Stephan
