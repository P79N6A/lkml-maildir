Ouch !
Well... This will be a bigger problem then. For some reason, nVidia
can't (or don't want) to tell us how to do fine backlight control. We
know how to switch the backlight on/off though since recently and Mark
just pushed a patch doing that for DPMS in XFree CVS "nv" driver.
Another bad new with nVidia based laptops is that there is little chance
we ever support sleep mode on these as so far, it doesn't seem nVidia
would be willing to give us the necessary informations to reboot the
chip on wakeup.

For finer backlight control, it may be possible to figure it out by
either tapping registers, looking at the nVidia OF driver, or examining
register contents in MacOS X (or tracing through MacOS X drivers).

Hrm... Bogompips is a bit low for a G4... I suspect it may be running at
the lower speed. I don't know for sure how speed control work on these
new models based on the 7457...

What's wrong ?

It's scattered. For recent machines, it's done by the video driver itself
(the video chip controls the backlight on the LVDS lines afaik)
