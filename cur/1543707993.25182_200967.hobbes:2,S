No, I think this is a non-problem.

That should come out in the wash with my patch anyway, because
it causes lowmem LRU pressure to assert a *lot* more slab pressure.
So highmem pressure should cause a similar amount of slab pressure
with either patch, it just comes about in different ways.
But allocations from lowmem will not shrink the slab nearly enough
with your patch because it shrinks by a percent of all pages.
