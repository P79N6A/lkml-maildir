Subject: [PATCH 06/11] unpaged: VM_NONLINEAR VM_RESERVED
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/11/17/199

There's one peculiar use of VM_RESERVED which the previous patch left
behind: because VM_NONLINEAR's try_to_unmap_cluster uses vm_private_data
as a swapout cursor, but should never meet VM_RESERVED vmas, it was a
way of extending VM_NONLINEAR to VM_RESERVED vmas using vm_private_data
for some other purpose.  But that's an empty set - they don't have the
populate function required.  So just throw away those VM_RESERVED tests.
But one more interesting in rmap.c has to go too: try_to_unmap_one will
want to swap out an anonymous page from VM_RESERVED or VM_UNPAGED area.
