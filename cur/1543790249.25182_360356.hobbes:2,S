	Guillaume apparently tried to use LSM for his fork connector and was
told "this doesn't belong here":
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0502.2/1000.html
	This patch does not affect whether or not these operations succeed and
hence is a poor match for LSM even though it hooks into the same places
in the kernel.
	There has been some discussion on lse-tech about 'task_notifiers' that
would allow multiple modules to hook into these paths without polluting
the paths themselves. I modified the patch with these proposals in mind.
Then, assuming such an interface developed, I could submit a small patch
which would convert to using the new interface.
	Would you still rather see the patch as an LSM module?
Thanks,
