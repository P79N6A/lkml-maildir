Andy, "call" pushes �"eip" into the stack, so later on
you can do "mov [esp],edx" and use edx as a pointer
to this 1024-bytes space.
This is a way to perform pc-relative addressing on
architectures which don't allow it directly such as
i386 (if I remember correctly).
Compare this to, for example, m68k, where
you can do "move label(pc),d0" to perform pc-relative
addressing if "label" is located near the current pc.
Greetz, Antonio.
