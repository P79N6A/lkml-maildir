Subject: [PATCH]  Set child process initial stack-pointers correctly on the v850
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/2/18/12

Previously the v850's copy_thread function didn't set the child's stack
pointer at all, with the result that it accidentally worked for vfork
(where the child has the same SP as the parent), but not for user
threads; kernel threads also accidentally worked, for a different
reason.
