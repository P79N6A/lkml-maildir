Hi Linus,
Hopefully the last batch of x86-64/i386 bug fixes for 2.6.18
It have several fixes for serious bugs (except for the defconfig update
and one annoyance fix) 
- Fix the compilation issue in some configs I added earlier on i386
- Fix new Calgary code breaks boot on some x460 setups
- Fix time keeping on Meroms with C3
- Revert a bogus change that broke non ACPI PCI bus discovery on K8
- Fix swiotlb=force (useful as workaround for hw bugs) 
- Remove a filemap.c printk that spams my nfsroot test machines a lot.
Please consider merging.
-Andi
