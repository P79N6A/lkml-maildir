Folks,
I doing the following sequence of events:
1. Tarred the directories of an existing system.
2. Booted my development system from a ramdisk using a rescue image.
3. fdisk /dev/hda and created a partition accepting the defaults.
4. cd /; mkdir j; mke2fs -cv /dev/hda1; mount -t ext2 /dev/hda1 /j;
5. Downloaded the tar, my compiled image and whole bunch of RPMs I need to
install on the system.
6. Reboot and I made the system boot from hard drive. I get this error when
I am installing the RPMs:
"EXT2-fs error (device ide0(3,1)); ext2_check_page: bad entry in
directory #30979: unaligned directory entry - offset=920,
inode=1388815025, rec_len=53409, name_len=47"
I ran memtest and my memory seems to be working fine. I am using kernel
2.4.19. Is this a bug in the kernel or am I doing anything wrong? Can
someone explain?
Regards,
Syam
