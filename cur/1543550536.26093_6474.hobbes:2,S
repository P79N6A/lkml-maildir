Because the VM has access to the usage patterns of those pages, and is
in the best position to tell which pages are oldest and should be
sent to disk and cleared from memory most quickly.

Because the filesystem doesn't have anything to do with page aging.
Page aging is something that happens in the VM to react to user
pressure in the page cache etc.  It's not something which the
filesystem has any business caring about.
There's good reason for this.  If you have multiple different types
of pages (eg. mmaped or not, mlocked or not, and pages from different
filesystems) in the cache, then how is any one filesystem _ever_ going
to be able to take a balanced look at memory and decide which pages
are ripe to be evicted?  Only the VM has that global knowledge.
Cheers,
 Stephen
