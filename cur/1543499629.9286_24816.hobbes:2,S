   Do we get any advantages from the drivers leaving "traces" in the
resource maps?
   Philosophically speaking, loading and unloading a driver should leave
the system in the same state as before.

   I've proposed ALLOCATED and OCCUPIED to be independent attributes
just to make it possible to clean up everything after driver unload.

   I don't understand this argument -- the user either has all the drivers
loaded (and then there is no difference between your and my approach)
or he doesn't, but then the hot plug behaviour is not consistent at all,
since collisions sometimes occur and sometimes not, depending on the
exact order of driver loadings.
				Have a nice fortnight
