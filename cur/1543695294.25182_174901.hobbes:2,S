Not nice.
fs/binfmt_misc.c:bm_register_write() is doing d_instantiate()
under a write_lock(), and the selinux d_instantiate() hook is
performing sleeping functions.
Now, we can just move the d_instantiate() call to outside the lock:
--- 25/fs/binfmt_misc.c~bm_register_write-locking-fix	2003-10-25 18:39:45.000000000 -0700
+++ 25-akpm/fs/binfmt_misc.c	2003-10-25 18:40:29.000000000 -0700
@@ -529,8 +529,8 @@ static ssize_t bm_register_write(struct 
 	inode->u.generic_ip = e;
 	inode->i_fop = &bm_entry_operations;
 
-	write_lock(&entries_lock);
 	d_instantiate(dentry, inode);
+	write_lock(&entries_lock);
 	list_add(&e->list, &entries);
 	write_unlock(&entries_lock);
 
which I think is OK, but the wider question would be: is the SELinux
d_instantiate callout allowed to sleep?  A quick audit seems to indicate
that it's OK, but only by luck I think.
