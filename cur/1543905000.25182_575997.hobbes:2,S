You can start with pvr2fb_setcolreg() and pvr2fb_set_pal_entry().
A few things I've noticed:
1. In pvr2fb_setcolreg(), pvr2fb_set_pal_entry() is called for bpp 16
and 32.  This means that the palette is modifiable, so
FB_VISUAL_TRUECOLOR is probably not the correct visual for this driver,
FB_VISUAL_DIRECTCOLOR is more appropriate.
So, you either remove the call to set_pal_entry() in setcolreg() or
change the visual to FB_VISUAL_DIRECTCOLOR. Of course, with directcolor,
the pseudo_palette is now written with tmp as:
tmp = transp << var->transp.offset | red << var->red.offset |
	green << var->green.offset | blue << var->green.offset;
 
2. Perhaps, the 3rd parameter passed to set_pal_entry() is not  correct?
Maybe you can try doing it like this for all bpp's, assuming ARGB?
pvr2fb_set_pal_entry(par, regno, transp << 24 | red << 16 | green << 8 |
			blue);
And if you want to maintain FB_VISUAL_TRUECOLOR format, initialize the
palette once on init:
for (i = 0; i < 256; i++)
	pvr2fb_set_pal_entry(par, i, i << 24 | i << 16 | i << 8 | i);
to create a linear color map consistent with truecolor, then remove all
other calls to pvr2fb_set_pal_entry().
