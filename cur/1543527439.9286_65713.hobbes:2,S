Wow!! More people working on the console code. I know the console system
discussion is on hold until 2.5.X but its nice to see people are actually
thinking about it. I really like to see a project formed to handle the
upcoming console issues. A linux-console project. A nice web page and
mailing list where we can discuss issues. Sourceforge would be a nice
place to set this up. This way we would be ready for the upcoming 2.5.X
kernels.

Nice ideas :)

I completely agree with you. You are not the only one working on this type
of approach. I have seen others approach it this way. I personally like
this approach. 
P.S
  So what does everyone say. We start a consoel project that everyone can
work on and discuss the new design.
