that was my point too.

exactly this is implemented in the current patches from Pavel.
the only difference is that filtering is not done in general LRU list,
which is not effective, but via per-container LRU list.
So the pointer on the page structure does 2 things:
- fast reclamation
- correct uncharging of page from where it was charged
  (e.g. shared pages can be mapped first in one container, but the last unmap
   done from another one).

Ouch, what makes you think so?
The fact that a page mapped into 2 different processes is charged only once?
Imho it is much more correct then sum of process' RSS within container, due to:
1. it is clear how much container uses physical pages, not abstract items
2. shared pages are charged only once, so the sum of containers RSS is still
   about physical RAM.

100% agree here.

taskgrp? resgrp?
