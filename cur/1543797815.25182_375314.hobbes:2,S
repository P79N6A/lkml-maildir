Hmmm...  Where can the new address [hint] be given in the call to
mremap(old_address, old_size, new_size, flags) ?
Also: probably the size is constant, perhaps even unknown to the user.
It would be nice if the old page need not exist (could have been
mmap()ed over) at the time of the move, although the proposed
move_vdso() does ask for what the old_addr used to be, as a check
on validity.
