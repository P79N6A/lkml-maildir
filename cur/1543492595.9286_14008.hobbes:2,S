Hello I'm happy to let this off:
PPSkit-0.6.0 for Linux-2.2.5 has been released! This new kit features
nanosecond time resolution (at least in theory) as well as new NTP
kernel routines. The performance seems interesting enough. See the
plots found in nanotest.tgz!
Unfortunately it seems "pcphy4" is down this morning, and I can't
physically reach it. Head for linux.kernel.org instead.
So here's the NEWS:
+ Updated BUGS about the ``mysterious jitter'' effect.  Updated patch
  for Linux-2.2.5 after extensive debugging runs.  Several tests passed
  without problems.
+ ``adjtimex()'' accepts any offset for ``MOD_OFFSET'', but
  ``hardupdate()'' will clamp the offsets.
+ Fixed bug with possibly persistent ``TIME_ERROR'' in ``adjtimex()''.
  Moved time functions that are not architecture dependent to common
  ``kernel/time.c''.
+ Added nanosecond time resolution (at least for i386 architecture).
+ Fixed problem in ``arch/i386/kernel/time.c'' when ``CONFIG_X86_TSC''
  was defined, but the processor was buggy (uninitialized variables
  would be used then).
+ Major cleanups with renaming: instead of calling ``get_fast_time()''
  you are expected to use ``get_exact_time()'' now (the ``fast''
  version wasn't faster than the ``normal'' version).  Likewise the
  ``slow'' versions are called ``poor'' now.  To avoid future
  confusion, ``[get]timeoffset'' has been renamed to ``microtime'',
  because it returns microsecods.  Funtions returning nanoseconds will
  have ``nanotime'' instead.  ``<linux/time.h>'' won't include
  ``<linux/timex.h>'' any longer; only ``<asm/timex.h>'' will be
  included.  ``<linux/timex.h>'' will only include the NTP interface
  stuff.
+ Updated serial driver to use ``do_clock_gettime()''.  Fixed memory
  leak associated with ``CIOGETEV''.
+ Added new POSIX.4 compatible functions ``do_clock_gettime()'',
  ``do_clock_settime()'', and ``do_clock_getres()'' that deal with
  nanoseconds.  Several related cleanups.
+ Merged the new ``nanokernel'' stuff into ``kernel/time.c'' (took
  over 4 hours without being complete).  Several cleanups and changes
  done.
+ Merged the new ``nanokernel'' stuff into ``<include/linux/timex.h>''.
  As some new bit definitions clash with older Linux extensions, the
  latter had to be relocated.  This will definitely break binary
  compatibility (``adjtime()'' is affected), so that I'll possibly
  clean up all the old mess.  ``<timex.h>'' is purely for
  ``adjtimex()'' now.
+ Updated ``INSTALL'' about xntp.  Updated ``enable_pps.c'' to support
  new nanokernel.  Added several new options.  Completely rewritten
  logic.
To complete it, here's an LSM entry:

As a special note: I broke the sparc clock due to my lack of assembly
knowledge for the SPARC.  In general, all architectures other than
i386 and more exotic subsystems and drivers may be broken.  After all
it's a "dot zero" release.  Enjoy anyway!

Ulrich
