Subject: 2.3.41: hangs when trying to start syslogd

I haven't seen this particular 2.3.41-ism reported yet.
Tried booting 2.3.41 last night...  On my machine, "syslogd" is the first
daemon that gets started after initialization of the network layer.  The
order of events is:
ifconfig lo 127.0.0.1
ifconfig eth0 ...
route add default gw ...
syslogd
hang
(klogd would have been the next daemon to start if syslogd had started).
The machine was at least responsive enough to interpret the 3-finger salute,
so I was able to drop back to 2.3.40 without hitting the reset switch and
waiting on fsck to do its thing.
