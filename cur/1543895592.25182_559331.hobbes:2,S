true. But when you run sid you get a newer version of git automatically.
Sooner or later. And you can always build it yourself. It's a pain in
the ass until you have all build dependencies installed and all the
tests pass. Most of them you can get by typing:
        apt-get build-dep git-core
But after that it is very straight forward.
