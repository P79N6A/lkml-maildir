That's surprising. On SuSE I always have to build it separately
with mkinitrd, and the kernel makefiles are the same, after all.
Anyway, your symptoms definitely look like a bad initrd, so you
may want to have a closer look in that area. Perhaps build a
kernel you can boot without initrd for testing, ie. with the
drivers for the root disk and filesystem built in.
