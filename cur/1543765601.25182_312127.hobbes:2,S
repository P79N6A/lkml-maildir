The requirements can be easily met in user-mode, probably
a lot easier than anything in the kernel.
LD_PRELOAD some custom 'C' runtime library functions, grab open()
read(), write(), etc. Write information to a pipe. Secure reader
daemon logs whatever it wants, based upon configuration settings.
After writing information to the pipe, executes the appropriate
syscall.
Done, no hacks, everything working in the correct context.
Cheers,
