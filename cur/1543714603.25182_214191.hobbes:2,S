Thanks.

With 2.6.5-rc1 the warning are gone.

You should be able to use:
-include Rules.make
See 'info make' - look after the include directive.

With 2.6.5-rc1 this will only cause files in the $(PWD) dir to be deleted,
not the kernel tree.

I really do not see the benefit compared to the current more free
naming scheme - which works.

The general feedback is that it looks like you have
made it less simple than it ought to be.
You should also consider that you end up with files
that does not look like ordinary kbuild makefiles.
When I get some spare time I will try to come up with a simpler example.
