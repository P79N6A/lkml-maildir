Yeah... and if manufacturers stopped being stubborn, and just made
it possible to create open-source drivers, all your friend would have
to do would be install the distro of his choice and it would all "just
work"... As it does currently with most ethernet cards. It just works.
Why? Because the drivers are opensource and in the kernel.

I feel the pain too. I used to do this.
Eventually the binary drivers stepped on eachother's toes and exploded
spectaculary, and there was no fix to be found. I just gave up, and am now
using computer with mostly opensource drivers... Only item I haven't been
able to get away from so far is the dialup modem, which I have to use
binary drivers for... But I only use it in emergencies anyway, since the cost-free
drivers are only able to do 14.4kbit.
Actually, I'd be happy if the binary drivers actually MANAGED to get a 14.4K
connection... Anything above 2400bps seems futile. It's not the telephone line,
either, my old 33.6K modem worked reliably at 33600 constantly. Then thunder
struck and fried it :-(
The conexant softmodem was the only one available in the local store, and I
recalled there were binary drivers for it. Pity they don't work that well :(
The softmodem cost only 50E. A "real" modem is about 150E -250E or
something, and I don't want to spend that kind of money on something
that only gives me 56kbit...
I use my cellphone these days... It has horrendous latency, but atleast it
talks standard Hayes AT through its dataport.
