They don't cause hangs, just IO errors (or panics if you configure
iommu debugging)
Actually I plan to fix this one, but it will require more work.
Basically the plan is to make the current dma zone variable sized
and get rid of all GFP_DMA allocations.  Merge the current soft iommu
with that new dma allocator. Then make sure all allocations
that need such low dma use a mask argument to some allocator.
Then we can have a option to configure the size of the dma low zone.
Users of broken hardware just configure a larger size.
