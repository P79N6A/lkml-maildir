Do you have a time-daemon running that synchronizes your machine to
some other?
Run this program as:
./xxx &>xxx.log &
...and see if your machine is really jumping.
#include <stdio.h>
#include <time.h>
int main()
{
    time_t tim;
    time_t last;
    (void)time(&last);
    (void)time(&tim);
    for(;;)
    {
        (void)time(&tim);
        if(tim != last)
        {
            if((last +1) != tim)
            {
                fprintf(stderr,"Time = %08lx\n", tim);
                fprintf(stderr,"Last = %08lx\n", last);
            }
            last = tim;
        }
    }
}
