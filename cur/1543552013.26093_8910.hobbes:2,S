i wrote too fast -- while there is a problem with x25 in the current
kernel, it may not be the line removing the include. instead, why is x25
being compiled for me? CONFIG_X25 is not set.  should anything be adding
X.25 support for me? i dont think so ... so it is probably a make
issue. ill grep the test10-pre4 and see if anything changed ...
