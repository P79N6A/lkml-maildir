We don't always - and I'd say in terms of ARM it would be extremely rare.
The sysfs API changes at the start of the last merge window is one example
of this.
I had everything nicely prepared in the ARM tree for merging shortly
after the window opened, and then wham bam thankyou mam, the merge
window opened and a lot ended up breaking.
We know that the -mm tree is pretty much useless in terms of code
coverage for ARM, and it's getting increasingly unlikely that anything
short of a build of all ARM defconfigs will pick up on merge issues -
which is a lot of CPU cycles, and I'm not going to insist its something
that should be done.
