Hey, it's entirely possible that we won't be able to do it at _all_ during 
2.7.x, since it would require that all the distributions have started 
using udev or equivalent. Which is by no means certain at all. It's 
possible that just lack of ubiqutous infrastructure will mean that it 
would be too painful to even try this in a few months..
Do don't worry too much.
