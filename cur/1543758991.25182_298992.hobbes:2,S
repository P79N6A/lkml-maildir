That's exactly what I'm saying. It already works this way, w/o
misleading the users and attaching confusing meaning to minor revision
numbers. It could do with being more clearly advertised and sticked to,
but that's about it.
Don't confuse more. People are already way to confused on their own.
If anything, if we expect a release to have ... interesting
side-effects, Linus will find just the funny words for the release notes
to say so ;-)
