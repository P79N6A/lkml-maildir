I'm not sure we're talking about the same thing. I'm not suggesting new
features in the VFS layer. I want to know if something breaks if I
implement this erase feature in the MMC layer. In essence the file
system has marked the sectors as "forget" by issuing a write to them.
The question is if it is assumed that they are unchanged if the write
fails half-way through.
I'd have to say that this is a dangerous assumption to make already
today since some systems might not be able to tell where it fails if a
large chunk of data is given to it, perhaps because of a deep pipeline
before it actually reaches the physical storage.
