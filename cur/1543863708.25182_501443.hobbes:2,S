Thanks for commenting. I agree more detailed explaination should
be better.
It seems another driver(qla4xxx) is also using shared queue tag.
It is natural to imagine there might be same symptom in that
driver. But I don't know the driver and have no hardware so I
can not say anything certain about it.
