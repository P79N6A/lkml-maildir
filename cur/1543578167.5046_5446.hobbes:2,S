At least I (who has started this threads) haven't said htey should use iobufs
internally.  I said: use iovecs in the interface, because this interface
is a little more general and allows to integrate into other parts (namely Ben's
aio work nicely).
Also the tuple argument you gave earlier isn't right in this specific case:
when doing sendfile from pagecache to an fs, you have a bunch of pages,
an offset in the first and a length that makes the data end before last
page's end.

It's not relly about reusing, but about compatiblity with other interfaces...
