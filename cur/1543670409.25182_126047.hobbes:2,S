Hehehe... try the attached if you're brave.  It took me a loooong time to 
get backboost to work right.  Mainly because backboost wasn't really broken 
:)))  This patch _needs_ backboost to work, (see sleep_avg_tick()) and it 
does seem to do the job very nicely.

The real problem is that there is no information in the fact that you were 
in lala land for a year or so.  Just because you slept through lunch, 
there's nothing that says you'll be a good mood afterward.  The useful 
information is the fact that someone else got a chance at the cpu, and 
you're only a really nice guy if you share a lot.  Take a look at what I 
did to activate_task()... if you slept for a short time, use that 
information.  If you slept for a long time, you get exactly what you need 
to finish your time slice.  This isn't subject to the number of tasks 
queued up, so the mistakes are smaller.  I also dispose of mistakes faster 
to make sure that interactive tasks (which aren't once they start running a 
lot) don't eat ages of cpu.  With this patch, I can get more than one task 
from a make -j30 bzImage in an ext3 partition to run concurrently, _and_ X 
is wonderful as well (gee, I really can have my cake and eat it too:).

Well,  it was just tossing the most damaging part of the problem into the 
bit bucket.
Anyway, anyone who thinks the scheduler is still unfair, or el-sucko in any 
way should feel free to beat upon this experiment.  I really like this 
one... think I'll even keep my fingers off it for a few minutes ;-)

Yeah, some of it _is_ gratuitous, but heck, it's almost pure research.  (no
