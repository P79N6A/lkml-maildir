As I said in my previous mail, the patch was just switching to use
vm_insert_page, and not any other cleanups.
I agree that a helper is a good idea, as the vmalloc, SetPageReserved,
remap_pfn_range (was remap_page_range in 2.4) pattern has been copied
and pasted across many video4linux drivers.
The cpia driver could do with other cleanups.
        - It doesn't have a sysfs release callback (so says warning printk).
	- The colourspace conversion has been disabled, but should be
	  ripped out.
	- Needs to support V4L2 API
