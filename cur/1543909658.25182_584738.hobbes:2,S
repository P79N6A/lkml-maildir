Filesystems (most of them) that require compilcated allocations at
writeout time suck. That said, especially with network ones, it
seems like making them preallocate or reserve required memory isn't
progressing very smoothly. I think these patchsets are definitely
worth considering as an alternative. 
No substantial comments though. I've been sick all week.
