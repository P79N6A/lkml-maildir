Only the staircase scheduler currently has an implementation of 
sched_batch and you need 2 more patches on top of the staircase patch 
for it to work. The most current version for 2.6.10 you can get with 
this patch sequence from the latest -ck patchset (or you could just use 
the full -ck patch)
http://ck.kolivas.org/patches/2.6/2.6.10/2.6.10-ck1/patches/
2.6.10_to_staircase9.2.diff
schedrange.diff
schedbatch2.6.diff
