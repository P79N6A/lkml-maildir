2.6.0-test1-mm1, Dell C840 laptop with a Geforce4 440Go.
I do *NOT* have 'CONFIG_FB_VGA16' set, but *do* have 'CONFIG_VIDEO_VESA'.
With this, 'vga=794' gets me a small font and a penguin on boot,
the NVidia binary driver works fine under X  after the minion.de patch,
switching back and forth works well, and life is generally good.
Mode 792 is in the VESA bios mode range: from Documentation/svga.txt:
   0x0200 to 0x08ff - VESA BIOS modes. The ID is a VESA mode ID increased by
        0x0100. All VESA modes should be autodetected and shown on the menu.
....
   CONFIG_VIDEO_VESA - enables autodetection of VESA modes. If it doesn't work
on your machine (or displays a "Error: Scanning of VESA modes failed" message),
you can switch it off and report as a bug.
Try turning that on?
