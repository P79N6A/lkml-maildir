Ah, yeah. Crap select not caring about dependencies...
The problem is that people will kill me, if they don't find
bcm43xx in the kconfig anymore, as they have to enable ssb
before that. Ya know the flame with Uwe Bugla going crazy
about that? :D
Same goes for b44. It was always there in kconfig without
additional deps, but now (when we merge the b44 port) we would
need ssb selected before we see b44.
Maybe default SSB to M?
