Actually, SAS does not cover the case of a SAS HBA connected directly
to a SATA device.  You must through an expander since SATA devices do
not speak STP and it is the expander that provides the STP -> SATA conversion
on the backend.  The spec does not preclude a SAS HBA speaking SATA
directly, but in doing so, it will be operating outside of the SAS
spec.
