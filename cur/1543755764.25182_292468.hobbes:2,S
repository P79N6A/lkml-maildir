i dont really like it - it's really the wrong interface to use. Futexes
are a much better locking/signalling interface. yield_to() would not be
available in 2.4 either. If the apropriate pthread objects are used then
libpthread will do it more or less optimally on 2.4 too, while on 2.6
they'd be perfectly fine and based on futexes. If 2.4 is not an issue
then a good, futex-based inter-process API is POSIX 1003.1b semaphores
(the sem_init()/sem_*() APIs). But if it should work inter-process on
non-futex kernels too, then only pthread spinlocks will do it.
