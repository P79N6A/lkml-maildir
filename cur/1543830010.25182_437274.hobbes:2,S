Subject: Fw: [PATCH 0/2] srcu: add RCU variant that permits read-side blocking
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I did get a couple of indications of interest in an RCU implementation
that permits sleeping on the read side, so this series is a cleaned-up
patch set, with the ops-ization of the rcutorture infrastructure separated
out into the earlier patchset.  Passed rcutorture on i386, ppc64, and s390.
Series includes:
o	Addition of SRCU primitives and documentation.
o	Addition of SRCU operations to rcutorture.
							Thanx, Paul
