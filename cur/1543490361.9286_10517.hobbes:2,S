I thought about setting O MaxMessageSize=20000 in my sendmail.cf,
but then it would probably wind up rejecting something important.
I would like to find a "safe" MaxMessageSize value to use in sendmail.cf,
(safe for these lists) 
-Maybe the list maintainers will decide on a safe MaxMessageSize value
for the listserver - but then, patches and what-not would have to be
strictly ftp'd (if they exceeded the MaxMessageSize value you set).
Before someone reads this and decides to use it, though, -keep in mind
that sendmail will reject ALL messages which exceed this size before
(during the SMTP session) they arrive. -the only notice you would get that
someone had tried to send you a too-large message would be if you are
closely watching your syslog output.
It's probably an indication that sendmail needs a "MaxHeaderSize" option,
since I noticed the bomber put lost of crap in the header.
It DID have a deleterious effect on exmh - effectively putting it into 
a tight loop while it attempted to deal with the header crap.
I think he was hoping to overrun a buffer somewhere.
