Probably not - I don't know this udma1 patch, but the error above
definitely occurs in my rmap area.  Could be due to slab corruption
from somewhere else, but that would be a poor assumption to make -
though neither my testing nor anyone else has seen the same (yet).
I imagine you're limited in the experiments you can do on that server,
and wouldn't want to run it with CONFIG_SLAB_DEBUG=y, which might show
up unrelated problems - interesting for us, but troublesome for you.
You're UP but PREEMPT on.  Hmm, there's a suspicious atomic_read
in exit_rmap: once upon a time I convinced myself it was good, but
it looks unsafe to me now - could cause a double free of an anonmm,
which would lead to your BUG if reallocated in between.
Not so likely for me to feel this is definitely the answer, but
likely enough to be well worth trying.  Please try patch below -
simple enough not to make your case worse anyway - thanks.
