"To understand the network, you must the network.." 
If you want to *understand* the network, I'd suggest starting off with a very
heavy dose of math, in particularly emergent systems:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence
 has a lot of good references.
However, you probably meant "understanding how to get the network to do something
useful for me", which is a totally different question....

Not a Linux kernel issue, but I'll be nice (even sorted in likely order
of usefulness for somebody so in need of direction):
0) A good book on C. (Yes, we start at 0. C, remember?)
1) Stevens "Unix Network Programming"
2) Douglas Comer "Internetworking with TCP/IP (Volume I): Protocol and Architecture"
3) 
http://www.ietf.org/rfc
 - in particular, you want RFCs 768, 791, 792, 793, and 1149
4) find /usr/src/linux/net -type f | xargs more
