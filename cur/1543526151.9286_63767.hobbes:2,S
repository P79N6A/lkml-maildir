Question: I wrote a few programs that would check it's own executable to
determin if it was set[ug]id.  If it was, it would assume something bad is
happening and not run.  Is there a way to get that information (I don't want
to test euid and uid, they could be different but the program not suid)
without using /proc?  I foolishly tryied opening argv[0] and aborting if it
wasn't openable.
