Why do you say that?
merge_bvec_fn is only set for dm, md, pktcdvd.c so what won't cause a
zero in real-world cases (it rarely makes sense to put a raid5 on top
of those things).
So it will only return zero when ->max_sectors or ->max_*_segments are
less than the default, and while there are certainly quite a few of
those I wouldn't have expected them to be a majority (else we would
have had more complaints from -mm testers).
Yes, we should find the minimum of those values for devices currently
in the array and use that information in raid5's merge_bvec_fn to stop
bios growing too large.  That would make it return 0 somewhat less
often.
But I think for a lot of modern hardware, it won't return 0 at all....
or am I just not seeing some really obvious typo that you can see ??
