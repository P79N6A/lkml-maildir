As long as there is no nasty recursive code, I think it's easier to shorten the
execution paths of the framebuffer code by inserting rescheduling hookups
(checking if rescheduling is needed then call schedule() ).
An update kernel thread could work as well, but it might be more complicated to
implement this, plus you get async updates instead of sync updates which is not
really desired.
correct me if I'm wrong.
Benno.
