Hi,
Yes, it is broken. There were two changes to mm/mmap.c:
a) in do_mmap() 
     vma->vm_file = file;
     file->f_count++;
b) in do_munmap()
     errno = -EINVAL; instead of 0, because Single UNIX v2 says so.
I have just checked that it is *not* b) that breaks it (thank heaven - for
b) was my patch :)
It appears that a /dev/3dfx usage count (file->f_count) is incremented but
not decremented. So I am suspicious of a) - perhaps there should be a
corresponding file->f_count-- in do_munmap() ?
I am trying to fix it now - will let you know if any luck.
Regards,
Tigran.
