Probably true unless it can reuse a callee-saved register.

Is the stack usage very close to exceeding 4 KB?  Could saving one more
pointer on the stack cause a problem?  Anyway, it's not that big of a
deal.  The code may look a little cleaner with a local variable, but
it's not that bad as it is.

It looks like a real function call.
