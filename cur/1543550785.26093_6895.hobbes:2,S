I knew about the existance of Danilo's driver, but I didn't know there was
a 2.4.x release. As I wanted to use the card under 2.4 and I thought it
would be better to share as much code as possible between drivers for different
cards based on the CS89x0 chipset, I made a driver based on the 2.4.0-test9
CS89x0 driver for ISA cards.

Ok. I will do so.

I think it is. Only a small part of the code is busdependant. Improvements
and bug fixes to the common part of the code are automatically available on 
all cards if we share this part. The CS89x0 chip is also used on a number of
embedded systems (eg. the Cirrus Logic EP7211 development board). In a
future version support for these implementations could be added easily
if we have a common part. A similar approach is used for the PCMCIA ibm 
tokenring driver.

Ok. I didn't know of the existance of a new version. Where can I find it ?

I realize my code may not be included in 2.4.0, but I decided to release
it on LKM nonetheless to see if other people are interested.

Ok. That's fine.

Ok. That's fine.
