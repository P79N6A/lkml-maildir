If a zone is under its min_pages limit, it needs reclaim.  Who/when/why
that reclaim is run doesn't really matter.
Yeah, we might run into some scaling problems with that many zones. 
They're unlikely to be unfixable.

Now I'm worried again.  This separation between "rss controller" and
"pagecache" is largely alien to memory reclaim.  With physical containers
these new concepts (and their implementations) don't need to exist - it is
already all implemented.
Designing brand-new memory reclaim machinery in mid-2007 sounds like a very
bad idea.   But let us see what it looks like.
