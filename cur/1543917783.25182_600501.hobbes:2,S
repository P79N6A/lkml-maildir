But you could do that just by having the current cpuset scheme able
to properly partition the system. You can't (easily) do this now because
you have so many tasks in the root cpuset that it is impossible to know
whether or not you actually want to load balance them.
You would do this by creating partitioning cpusets which carve up the
root cpuset (basically -- have multiple roots).

In this case the admin would simply not partition the system (they
would retain a single root cpuset).
Neither approach is really fundamentally more or less powerful than
the other, but what I object to in yours is adding these flags which
don't allow the admin to specify what they want, but to specify how they
want it done.
Moreover, sched_load_balance doesn't really sound like a good name
for asking for a partition. It's more like you're just asking to have better
load balancing over that set, which you could equally achieve by adding
a second set of sched domains (and the global domains could keep
globally balancing).
Basically: the admin doesn't know best when it comes to how the
scheduler should work; the admin knows best about how they intend
the system to be used.

Rather than require the admin to know the intricate details about
how and why the scheduler load balancing gets broken, and when they
might or might not need to use this flag, they can just specify what they
want to be done, and the kernel can choose the optimal strategy.

No, I'm insisting that *no* single administrative point of control
determines the sched domains. Not directly. The kernel should.
cpusets API should be rich enough that the kernel can derive tihs
information from what the admin has intended.
