__update_count needed to be able to do the decrement from 0 or
the count, whichever was greater.  I have eliminated this in the
new patch (patch III).

OK.  We dealt with hash collisions by sharing waitqueues.  This works, but
means we have to do wake-all.  My new patch uses its own queues: we still
share queues, but we only wake the first one waiting on our counter.

Hmmm.... it should be pretty easy to extend: the queues can be shared.

Yes, but counting semaphores need two variables, or cmpxchg.  Mutexes do not
need either (proof by implementation 8).  While general counting semaphores
may be useful, the fact that they are not implemented in the kernel suggests
they are not worth paying extra for.

This is a definite advantage: my old fd-based code never looked at the
userspace counter: it had a kernel sempahore to sleep on for each
userspace lock. OTOH, this involves kernel allocation, with the complexity
that brings.

They're interruptible, so you'll get -ERESTARTSYS.  Should be fine.

I agree.  While originally reluctant, when it's one page per sleeping
process it's rather neat.
Cheers!
