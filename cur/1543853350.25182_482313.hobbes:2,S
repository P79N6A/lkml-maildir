As I told before (but it's not delivered to the arm-linux-kernel), I
can reproduce it too, using glibc-2.4 or glibc-2.5. I can't reproduce
it using glibc-2.3.5.
My further investigations shows that reading libutil.so.1
(cat /lib/libutil.so.1 > /dev/null) prior using it eliminates
segfault. That, I suppose, means that glibc can easily operate on 
cached file, but refuses to initially ""read"" it from disk properly.
Quoting Richard Purdie:
"The file is read ok from the disk when copying and when read with
md5sum. I therefore wonder if the dynamic linker is doing something it
shouldn't."
Though, it may be either glibc or JFFS2 issue. As for glibc, it's not
using read() call as do cat, cp or md5sum, glibc using readonly
mmap call (which is supported by JFFS2 if I understood code correctly)
on libraries ld-linux wants to load.
I hope these itinerary of mine will bring some light on that issue, and
someone will guess where real bug is. ;-)
