I don't have a Windows box, but I'm quite sure Windows (without the more 
esoteric switches) is quite stable, even in SMP. The '95 and NT 4.0 days 
are gone. Give the drivers the environment they like (mangle the 
addresses if necessary, single thread them, allow them larger stacks, 
whatever it takes) and they will work well. Put them in userspace if 
you're paranoid or isolate them using binary translation.
 From this discussion, it looks like the choices of the future are 
Windows drivers or serial terminals. Excuse me now while I look for my 
null-modem cable.
