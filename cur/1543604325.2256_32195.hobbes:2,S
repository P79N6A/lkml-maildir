Quoting from pdc202xx.c:
 *  The latest chipset code will support the following ::
 *  Three Ultra33 controllers and 12 drives.
 *  8 are UDMA supported and 4 are limited to DMA mode 2 multi-word.
 *  The 8/4 ratio is a BIOS code limit by promise.
 *
 *  UNLESS you enable "CONFIG_PDC202XX_BURST"
Does this match your experiences with that many controllers in the same box?
Thanks for the reply, by the way.
