No, the point is not to put the backup daemon into the kernel, but to  
provide a way for the backup daemon and my user process to  
communicate DSA key details without completely giving the backup  
daemon my key.  I may not entirely trust the backup daemon not to get  
compromised, but with support for the kernel keyring system,  
compromising the backup daemon would only compromise the backed up  
files, not the private keys and other secure data.
