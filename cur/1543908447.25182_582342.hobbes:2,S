I figured as much.  Thanks for confirming this.

Possibly.  Either that or we've uncovered some latent bugs.  Maybe a 
combination of the two.  Can you list those 19 changes so we can 
evaluate them?  I'm told there were some *(volatile *) bugs fixed in gcc 
recently, so it's also possible your 3.4.6 is showing those.  I can test 
that on a more recent gcc on ia64 if it's inconvenient for you to do so 
on your test box.
