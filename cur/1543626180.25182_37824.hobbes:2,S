I am so really sorry to ask, but I simply do not understand...
How can it be that the patch is US-compatible, but the Changelog is not?
After all the Changelog is a summary of the changes in the patch...

When you have multiple CPUs with one interrupt controller, you don't
have much choice. You either use spin-locks or you Blue-Screen.
Since Linux doesn't have a "Blue-screen of death", it needs spin-
locks.
