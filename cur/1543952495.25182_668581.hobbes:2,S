Yeah, just checking.

I'll take you word for it :)  But there's also non-PCI things between
the device and the cpu, so anything's potentially possible.

I think the 2nd at least. If MSIs can pass the DMAs they're signalling
completion for then they're no better than LSI, the driver will still
need to go check the DMA has finished somehow.

I'd vote for 1), that way if someone comes up with a semantic for
read/write/both we will have sensible flag names.
