Well, sorry :-(

I didn't invent the definition for struct flock64.
The definition is in the test7-patch, and it's identical in
include/asm-i386/fcntl.h and in include/asm-sparc/fcntl.h
That's why I assumed that this definition might be used for the other
architectures as well (where it was missing in the test7-patch).
If there are problems with the struct, maybe we should consider changing
it for all architectures?
