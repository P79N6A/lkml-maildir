No. It is clear that you have the *option* of keep upgrading, but it is 
also equally clear that Linux has always decided *not* to exercise that 
option, exactly because I liked the GPLv2, not some "future upgrade".
I decided that long before I saw the GPLv3.
And I'm surprised by people who wonder why I did that.
I'm _intelligent_, dammit. That means that I can foresee the future to 
some degree, at least in the limited sense of what is a likely outcome of 
my actions.
Why are people surprised by the fact that I have foresight? I may be known 
for being an impolite bastard, but quite frankly, anybody who thinks I'm a 
_stupid_ impolite bastard must be missing a page.
You can disagree with my opinions. You can call me obstinate, impolite, 
and opinionated. But quite frankly, very few people have ever found me 
*stupid*.
So give me that - I'm not stupid. That means that I actually *can* predict 
the future to some fuzzy degree, and that people really should *not* be 
surprised by the fact that I never let the FSF control my choice of 
license.

There's no "blame". There's only credit.
Besides, you are wrong. The *default* for the GPLv2 in the presense of 
license information is *not* "v2 or later"
In order to get "GPLv2 or later", you actually have to explicitly specify 
it.
I just find it sad that so many people did that, often apparently just 
because they didn't actually read or understand the license.
