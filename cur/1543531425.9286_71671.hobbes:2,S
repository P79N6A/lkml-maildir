That's right, but not the problem.
At least Kernel 2.3.47 will detect with IDE-SCSI Emulation on the PD/CD-ROM Drive (one Drive!) two ATAPI Devices (CD-ROM and PD Device) and that's correct.
But since Kernel 2.3.48 there is a change in the detection in IDE-SCSI Emulation or IDE Driver and this will ONLY detect the CD-ROM Device, but not the PD Device on the same Drive.
I think there is a problem in that detection function.
