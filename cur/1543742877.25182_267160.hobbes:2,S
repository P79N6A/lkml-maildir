I think that's normal, because chown() applies to an object in the filesystem,
while fchown() applies to the FD. (In fact, it applies to an inode.)
However, socket fd of any kind don't have an associated inode, because, well
sockets are not stored on the filesystem.
As some manpage might say, the socket thing you see in "ls -l" is just a
reference thing. When you connect to it, ls -l /proc/pidofprogram/fd/ does not
show the path, but [socket:xxxx] which shows that the filesystem object is not
used anymore.

What would you like it to do? EINVAL like the others or change the actual
inode's permission?
