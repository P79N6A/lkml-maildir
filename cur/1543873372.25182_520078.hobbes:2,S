Ideally, afaik we should use:
-3 values for translation force (linear force): x,y,z components of
the force vector.
-4 values for rotation force (torque): x,y,z,w components of the
quaternion. You can also use euler angles (and i think there are
another one or two notations), which is just 3 values, but i'm not
sure it will be a correct decision (due to the gimbal lock problem,
which may or may not be present in ff devices, dunno).
