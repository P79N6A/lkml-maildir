Looks good to me, although my understanding of these memory ordering issues
is woeful.
We do want to avoid taking inode_lock in mark_inode_dirty() - that is called
very frequently.  I'm rather surprised that inode_lock contention has not
been a problem thus far.
Longer-term we should probably turn i_state into a ulong and only run atomic
bitops against it.
