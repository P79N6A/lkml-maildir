There are several scenarios. The one that worries me most on TCP
connections is when the TCP socket on the server gets swamped for some
reason, and the call to sendmsg() sleeps. This means that if one
client has fired off a load of requests, and then doesn't listen for
the reply, we can end up sleeping for a long time (and being
unavailable to other clients).
OTOH under UDP, we use nonblocking I/O, so the sendmsg() returns, and
the server can just drop the request (as the UDP allows for quick
resends). The thread in this scenario therefore never sleeps if a
client is unavailable. It can only sleep on (relatively fast) disk
I/O.

That is correct. TCP is designed to be a reliable protocol, so clients
are allowed to assume that the server will reply to a request once it
has been sent.

Well... Thread limits can be changed. My main objection is that it is
ugly. Why allocate a thread when what you want to do is to be able to
cope with sleeping? We have non-blocking I/O, and the tcp
'write_space()' socket routine (see the client use in
net/sunrpc/xprt.c) that was designed to enable a thread to get called
back once a socket is free.

http://www.fys.uio.no/~trondmy/src/pre_alpha/linux-2.4.0-test6-rpctcp.dif
It's a patch against linux-2.4.0-test6 and is basically at the 'toy'
stage. Definitely nowhere near ready for release. IIRC though it did
actually run fairly reliably.
Cheers,
