One important thing I think in Andrea's case, the memory will be accounted
for (eg. we can limit mlock, or work within various memory accounting things).
With fragmentation, I suspect it will be much more difficult to do this. It
would be another layer of heuristics that will also inevitably go wrong
at times if you try to limit how much "fragmentation" a process can do.
Quite likely it is hard to make something even work reasonably well in
most cases.

Well yes and slab has issues today too with internal fragmentation,
targetted reclaim and some (small) higher order allocations too today.
But at least with config_page_shift, you don't introduce _new_ sources
of problems (eg. coming from pagecache or other allocs).
Sure, there are some other things -- like pagecache can actually use
up more memory instead -- but there are a number of other positives
that Andrea's has as well. It is using order-0 pages, which are first class
throughout the VM; they have per-cpu queues, and do not require any
special reclaim code. They also *actually do* reduce the page
management overhead in the general case, unlike higher order pcache.
So combined with the accounting issues, I think it is unfair to say that
Andrea's is just moving the fragmentation to internal. It has a number
of upsides. I have no idea how it will actually behave and perform, mind
you ;)

I think it did get brushed aside a little quickly too (not blaming anyone).
Maybe because Linus was hostile. But *if* the idea is that page
management overhead has or will become a problem that needs fixing,
then neither higher order pagecache, nor (obviously) fsblock, fixes this
properly. Andrea's most definitely has the potential to.
