I am getting an Oops/kernel panic with kernel 2.4.5.
Here is what the panic notice says in part:
The panic notice said:
Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 846ea4e6
*pde = 0
Oops: 0 0 0 0
cpu: 0
EIP: 0010:[<c024724c>]
EFLAGS: 00010286
Process ax25ipd (pid:270,stackpage=c54a700)
call trace:
CODE: 8a 40 40 25 ff 00 00 00 83 c0 02 8d 14 c5 00 00 00 00 29 c2
Kernel panic: Aiee, Killing interrupt handler!
In interrupt handler - not syncing..
Not sure what to do now other than to go back to a previous release.
Is anyone else having this problem?  Is there a solution?  Or 
maybe I haven't provided enough info..
The above is all that the Oops notice reported other than some numbers for
call trace, etc.. Its all there otherwise..
