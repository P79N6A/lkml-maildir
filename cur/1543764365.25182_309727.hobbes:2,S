I am trying to build a linux kernel and toolchain for a le mips processor
I have the following versions
binutils-2.15.96
gcc-3.4.3
glibc-2.3.4
linux kernel 2.6.11.6
When it build all build fine and it gets to the kernel and build all the 
code and then i get this error
LD .tmp_vmlinux1
mipsel-linux-ld:arch/mips/kernel/vmlinux.lds:470: parse error
make: ***[.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
I can see that someone else has had this problem and the advice was hack it 
and try again.
http://www.linux-mips.org/archives/linux-mips/2005-01/msg00059.html
But this is not good in a complete build environment so does anyone know 
what causes this bug and what i can do to solve it
Please help and thanks in advance
