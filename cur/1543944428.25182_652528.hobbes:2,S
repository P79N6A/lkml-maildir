All of your beliefs are unfortunately without the understanding
of restrictions that exist in several partition layouts such
as the Sun disk label one.
You have to start the superblock somewhere other than zero or
else you lose a huge chunk of your disk, and furthermore a
zero based partition is what all of the Sun disk label
creating programs make by default.
"I make a default disk label, I put btrfs or XFS on there, my disk
 label is gone."
Real intuitive.
