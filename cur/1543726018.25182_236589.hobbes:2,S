Yes, but unless you are copying from vim or emacs, where the editor is
converting tabs to N spaces based on your settings, this is fixable.   
For example it should be possible to run diff from the command line and
copy the output, preserving tabs correctly.  There is an alpha quality
patch floating around to add this functionality to xterm.
But, this is horribly OT.  My main point was that it's almost always not
the mailer's fault if your patches are getting mangled in this way.
