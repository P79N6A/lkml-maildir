Done.

Fixed.

Due to the new syscalls being derived from the readv()/preadv()
versions, which have the same inconsistency.  Dunno why.  I'd suspect
the reason is that the compat syscalls tend to be overlooked when the
code is updated.  Proof: patch #1 in this series ...
I'll switch them all over in a separate followup patch.

Yes, makes sense.
cheers,
