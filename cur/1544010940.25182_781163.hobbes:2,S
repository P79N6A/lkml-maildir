The fix results in better handling of unexpected IRQs on serialized IDE
ports.  However since unexpected IRQs coming from a device is not something
we should normally see and I don't recall seeing any bugreports that would
be potentially closed by this fix I don't think that there is an urgent need
to backport it (thanks for caring about 2.4.x users anyway!).
Thanks,
