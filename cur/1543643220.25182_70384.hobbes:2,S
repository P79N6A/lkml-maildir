   The system has 4G of ram, and 4G of swap.  So real memory is not an 
issue.  The system is a intended to be an nfs server.   As a result nfs 
performance is my only real concern.  I should really use CONFIG_3GB as 
I'm not doing much in user space other a tftp, and dhcp server.
   In any case the system isn't in production so I can leave it as is 
till monday.
