Hi Andrew,
In reply to this message I will be posting PnP fixes against 2.6.2-rc2, and I would
appreciate if you would add them to your -mm tree.  If you choose to include them
in -mm, could you please remove the following patches first:
pnp-fix-2.patch
pnp-fix-3.patch
8250_pnp-cleanup.patch
alsa-pnp-fix.patch
Many of these patches have been updated since thier initial inclusion.  Just to be
safe, I think it would be best to start with a clean tree.  I apologize if I have
overlooked any other patches.
Also, I decided to drop the isapnp fix and will be looking into a more complete fix
shortly.  I'll have an update for it out soon.
This set of changes includes full support for the module_device_tables, various
fixes, and updated kconfig comments.
Thanks,
Adam
