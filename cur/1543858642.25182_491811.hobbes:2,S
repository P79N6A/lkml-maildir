The bug appears to be somewhere else, somehow the ref count on ioctx is
all messed up.
In aio_complete, __put_ioctx() should not be invoked because ref count
on ioctx is supposedly more than 2, aio_complete decrement it once and
should return without invoking the free function.
The real freeing ioctx should be coming from exit_aio() or io_destroy(),
in which case both wait until no further pending AIO request via
wait_for_all_aios().
