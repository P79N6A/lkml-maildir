Jean-Francois,
You are reporting a panic but missing the most important ingredient:

If "xx" means "kiss-kiss" then you can "kiss good bye" to any hope of
resolving this panic until you send the oops message passed through
ksymoops. If this is really a panic and not an oops then you need to
capture it through a serial console and then pass through ksymoops on the
next boot.

Tigran
