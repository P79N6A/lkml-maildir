The point is: simpler in-order implementations. In-order CPUs don't
reorder instructions at run-time, as the name suggests.

You're confusing brach prediction with instruction predication.
Branch prediction is a design feature, needed for most pipelined CPUs.
Because they're pipelined, the CPU may not know whether to take or not
the branch when its time to fetch the next instructions. So, instead of
stalling, it guesses. If its wrong, it has to rollback.
Instruction predication is another form of conditional execution: each
instruction has a predicate (a register) and is only executed if the
predicate is true.
The bad thing is that these instructions take their slot in the
pipeline, even if the CPU knows they'll never be executed in the moment
it fecthed them.
The good sides are:
a) Unlike branches, it doesn't have a constant mispredict penalty. So,
its good to replace "small" and unpredictable branches
b) Instead of a control dependency (branches) predication is a data
dependency. So, it gives compilers more freedom in scheduling-

Depends on the workload..
