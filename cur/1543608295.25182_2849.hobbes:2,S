It was me. Agree completely that allocating new flag would be better. I
just wanted "notail" to actually work and be accessible through standard
utilities, because it's really useful. "nodump" looked like least useful
of flags for me, because dump(8) doesn't work with reiserfs (not that it
worked with ext2 reliably either). I actually tried to contact Remy Card
and Theodore Tso, to discuss how [ls|ch]attr can be modified to support
different file-systems, but to no avail.

I would rather like to see lsattr/chattr to become file-system
independent. This requires that all file-systems use the same ioctl cmds
to set and get bitmasks associated with inodes and provide somehow a
mapping between symbolic name of an attribute and bitmask. Support for
octal bitmask (a la chmod) in chattr is also an option.
