Hmmm... workarounds are not new  features, but bug-fixes ;-)
The new vm is not a *new* feature, it is just a different vm than the 
old. Even if you treat it as a new
feature, it should then be incorporated into a new-feature release, i.e 
not in a 2.4.10.4, but maybe in what
would have been a 2.4.11.0.
I'm not going to be anal about this, but a more structured way of 
handling new features/bug-fixes and release
numbering would be nice. A lot easier to know what you are programming 
against and what you are
installing/testing.
