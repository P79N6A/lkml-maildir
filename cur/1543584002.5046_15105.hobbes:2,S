yes, it did.  But this is not the problem.  The log was 
captured on a serial console.  Doing an ALT_SYSRQ-T (or
BREAK/T) will cause a large amount of output to be written
to the serial port while interrupts are disabled.  It
takes so long that the NMI watchdog decides the CPU
is stuck.
Actually, I think the remove-the-console-lock patch which
went into 2.4.2-ac13 will fix this - timer interrupts
should now continue to be serviced while the task table
is being dumped out.
I'm going to pretend I meant this to happen :)
I note that the Mem-info dump only shows the page table cache
size for the local CPU.  It should be showing the info for all
CPUs. Minor thing.
But the failing of Vibol's server remains a mystery.  I suggest
an upgrade to 2.4.2-ac13 would be worthwhile - at least we'll
get a full task table dump.
