Sure... that's probably true... my knowledge of Linux SCSI device
drivers is limited to hacking the ability to recognize a PCI card. One
question though... why does the Mylex DAC960 driver acquire the
io_request spinlock? They seem to be similar functions to those in the
BusLogic driver that don't have locks. Oh well... just my ignorance.
