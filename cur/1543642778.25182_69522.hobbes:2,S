It's worth taking a deep breath at this point and considering whether that
part of delalloc can be written generically, supposing that page->buffers
were restored to its former non-opaque status.

Christoph would be familiar with that issue, if there is one.

The NFS server is still a deep, black hole in the kernel from my point of
view and I'd like that situation to end as soon as possible, so it might
as well start ending now.  Can you provide me a pointer to go start
digging at that specific question?
(And strongly agreed about the invalidate_inode_pages(2) issue: at some
point it would behoove VM and NFS developers to reach a mutual
understanding of what that interface is supposed to do, because it is
growing new warts and tentacles at an alarming rate, and still seems to
be, at best, a heuristic.  I currently have the impression that the
intent is to make files sort-of coherent between clients, for some
slippery definition of sort-of.)

OK, well I have four action items:
  - Listen to Christoph wax poetic about how XFS handles buffers and
    whether he needs them to be opaque to the vfs.
  - Think about delalloc with the goal of providing the mechanism at
    the vfs level, subject to somebody proving it actually has some
    benefit (maybe XFS already proves this?  Come to think of it, if
    XFS already supports delayed allocation and doesn't rely on
    page->private...)
  - Find out what NFS really thinks invalidate_inode_pages(2) is
    supposed to do.
  - Start to sniff at the credential issue, with a view to
    ascertaining whether that subsystem ultimately relies on the
    buffer field being opaque.  Intuitively I think 'no', the
    credential mechanism is supposed to be a generic vfs mechanism,
    and so for NFS or anyone else to bury credential state in the
    field formerly known as buffers is fundamentally wrong.
In general, I think we'd be better off if page->buffers was not opaque,
and that it should remain non-opaque until we are definitely ready to
get rid of them.  Doing otherwise will just allow various applications
to start growing tendrils into the field, making it that much harder
to get rid of when the time comes.
So the question is, does anyone *really* need (void *) page->private
instead of page->buffers?
