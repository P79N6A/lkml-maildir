Hi,
does anyone here know, how I can get the irda on my dell notebook to work on
a plain vanilla kernel 2.4.23 version?
My irda system works fine with an SuSE-Linux kernel and it also worked with
an older 2.4 kernel with ac-patch. But with the plain original kernel (in
several versions) I can't get my irda to work.
Can someone give me a hint, what I'm doing wrong, that irda refuses to work
on my system?
Bye 
Ralf
