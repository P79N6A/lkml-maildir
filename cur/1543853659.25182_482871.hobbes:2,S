That's odd. Here's my .git/remotes/origin
---8<---8<---8<---
URL: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/qgit/qgit.git
Pull: master:origin

I got the tag now, by doing
$ git fetch --tags
although that didn't work last time I fetched the objects (which was 
after you had posted the announcement). Strange. This was with git 
version 1.4.3.rc3.gb32db.
