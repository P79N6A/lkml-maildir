At the moment I am.  But I also tried native Linux drivers too with the same
result.  I've tried Windows drivers under DriverLoader and ndiswrapper as well
as the native Aetheros driver, the native ADMTek driver and another native
driver the name of which escapes me right now.  It's definitely not a driver
problem because I've tried several with the same results.
BTW, Driverloader is actually a very slick package.  For 802.11a/g parts, it
definitely seems to be the way to go if stability is an issue.  While it is a
commercial product it's worth the $20US if you use high-speed wireless cards.
Ndiswrapper is also nice but it is not as complete as DriverLoader currently
and does not work with many cards.  As for the Windows NDIS drivers that are
run with them, they actually tend to be very stable and I have no problem with
running them from a "purity" standpoint.  I believe in doing what works, and
right now nothing is working with Linux.
The native drivers are in various states but all have problems which make them
undesirable.  The Aetheros driver is best of the bunch, though.
Thanks,
Carl Thompson
