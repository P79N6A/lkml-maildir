Andi,
I too am open to having a API, for KGDB, but it does need more than just 
the trap vectors and the serial driver as hook points. There are a 
number of patches to fix problems randing from the NET_POLL API, NMI 
handling, and saving a bit more information when loading kernel modules.
If you have an API, that you would like to contribute or suggest, I for 
one am interested. I have long thought it would be nice to be able to 
choose between kernel debug tools KDB, KGDB, KEXEC etc... much like you 
can dynamically load I/O modules in KGDB and choose either RS232 or 
Ethernet after the kernel has booted.
At the current time, I am most certainly trying to consolidate the 
source forge KGDB patches, Tom Rini's branch, as well as my own 
development branch and hopefully Sergei's development branch as well. 
Perhaps after the code stream is stable you we can take a further look 
at what it takes to abstract a generic kernel debug interface. In the 
mean time if you have code or skeleton API proposal, I am definitely 
listening. It would be nice to have an in kernel soft single step API as 
an example, which could be leveraged by KGDB and utrace/ptrace, but that 
is a bit forward looking at this point.
Jason.
