--------------------
One hunk applied with fuzz and two hunks were rejected when applied both 
to 2.5.66 stock and bk-latest.  I fixed up the rejects by hand and 
compiled a new kernel against bk-latest.  I am running with that version 
now, which doesn't emit the string of messages I reported originally.  The 
only minor anomaly I note is the cursor is a three-segment underscore 
rather than a solid underscore.
