A pointer to them?  You mean a SHA1 hash of them? or what?
Where is the *real* data stored?  The real files, the real patches?
Are these somewhere completely outside of git?

Perhaps I'd understand this if you tell me what "recreate" means.
If a have a SHA1 hash of a file, and I have the file, I can verify that said
file has the SHA1 hash it's supposed to have, but I can't generate the file
from it's hash...
Sorry for being stubbornly dumb, but you'll have a couple of us puzzling
