I didn't say to change this now, not tomorrow...
Just tell them to change their code because, somewhere in the future,
the API might change. Maybe the new kernel APIs are better, faster, more
secure, so perhaps there is a good reason as why it would be better to
use the new API.
And for those who want to use the old API, let's give them the ability,
but also make it possible to compile the kernel with _only_ the new API.
The different distributions will take care of it.
And about the compatibility layer.. the companies have to make a
different one for each stable series anyways.
