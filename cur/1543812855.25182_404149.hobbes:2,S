In real SCSI systems that usually maps to card, bus/cable, ID and LUN 
and allows some correspondence between physical and logical space. Handy 
to trouble shoot, if you see a lot of errors on the same cable yo have a 
clue that it may be common cause.

Good to see you still around and posting about the relevant technical 
details.
