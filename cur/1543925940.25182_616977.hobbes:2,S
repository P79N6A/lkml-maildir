I have no doubt it can work with a "regular" interrupt.

I meant the register_die_notifier() mechanism which allow you to
chain a handler on NMI interrupts. At least that's my understanding
reading the code:
static int nmi_setup(void)
{
        int err=0;
        int cpu;
        if (!allocate_msrs())
                return -ENOMEM;
        if ((err = register_die_notifier(&profile_exceptions_nb))){
                free_msrs();
                pfm_release_allcpus();
                return err;
        }

Yes, horribly more complicated because of locking issues within perfmon.
As soon as you expose a file descriptor, you need some locking to prevent
multiple user threads (malicious or not) to compete to access the PMU state.
I think the value add of NMI can be as well achieved with advanced PMU features
such as Intel Core 2 PEBS.
