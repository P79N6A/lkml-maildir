My current setup has the kernel and metalog logging to the serial port, which I am monitoring using kermit rom another machine.
Would you mind explaining to me how to generate the strace track and/or how to do "proper" debugging when this crash occurs?
ATM, the machine writes the report to the serial console, and completely freezes.  I imagine that gdb would be involved here, but Im not sure how to go about setting that up.
