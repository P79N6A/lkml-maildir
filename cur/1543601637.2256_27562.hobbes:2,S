No, it won't break.  I tried this patch on an Athlon 1300 Mhz 200 FSB,
that has worked with athlon optimizzed kernels without any problems, and
it still works. I did this just for curiosity, and i was
avoiding to post a long series of it works for me too, since I have just
abit MBs, and before the patch was out I just putted a working bios on
every MB.  Anyway I tried the patch on working Athlon.
And let's try to get VIA to tell us what is going on....
