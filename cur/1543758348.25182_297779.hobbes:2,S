Which kernel? There was an off-by-one for odd array sizes in the
original posted version that was quickly spotted:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.11-rc4/2.6.11-rc4-mm1/broken-out/sort-fix.patch
I've since tested all sizes 1 - 1000 with 100 random arrays each, so
I'm fairly confident it's now fixed.
