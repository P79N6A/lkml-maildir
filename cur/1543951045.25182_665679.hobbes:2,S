Why not the other way around ?
inttypes.h is C99 and defines int16_t (or uint16_t). i do not see any reason
not to use them or any other type (like __u8) that does actually the same.
In that case we do not need different type names for userspace/kernelspace, or is there an other name
for int ? in that case we can remove the whole heap of typedef's.
