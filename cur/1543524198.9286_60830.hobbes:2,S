  Just to clarify: I'm not the original poster. Yes, the talkd must be 
fixed, my application not (because it checks if the error occurs).
  Look:
socket(PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_IP) = 4
bind(4, {sin_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(53), sin_addr=inet_addr("0.0.0.0")}, 16) = 0
listen(4, 20)                           = 0
socket(PF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, IPPROTO_IP) = 5
bind(5, {sin_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(53), sin_addr=inet_addr("0.0.0.0")}, 16) = 0
select(12, [4 5], NULL, NULL, NULL)     = 1 (in [5])
recvfrom(5, "\323x\1\0\0\1\0\0\0\0\0\0\3ola\4"..., 512, 0, {sa_family=0, sa_data="\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0"}, [16]) = 29
 | 00000  d3 78 01 00 00 01 00 00  00 00 00 00 03 6f 6c 61  .x...... .....ola |
 | 00010  04 68 6f 6d 65 02 62 72  00 00 01 00 01           .home.br .....    |
# Oh, why do I have the packet, the lenght is right (errno is not set)
and the sockaddr is completely wrong ?
# And, in the second turn...
select(12, [4 5], NULL, NULL, NULL)     = 1 (in [5])
recvfrom(5, "\323x\1\0\0\1\0\0\0\0\0\0\3ola\4"..., 512, 0, {sin_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(1026), sin_addr=inet_addr("10.0.0.13")}, [16]) = 29
 | 00000  d3 78 01 00 00 01 00 00  00 00 00 00 03 6f 6c 61  .x...... .....ola |
 | 00010  04 68 6f 6d 65 02 62 72  00 00 01 00 01           .home.br .....    |
  Why the first (only the first) pass in this loop gives the error ?
