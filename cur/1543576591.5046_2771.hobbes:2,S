I can confirm the bug which loses updates to the inn active file when
it's unmapped is present again in 2.4.0-test12.
I put "cp active active.ok" in the rc file before shutting down the
daemon and at the next boot the files are different, every time.
Alexander Viro posted this test case:
#include <unistd.h>
main(argc,argv)
int argc;
char **argv;
{
        int fd;
        char c=0;
        truncate(argv[1], 10);
        fd = open(argv[1], 1);
        lseek(fd, 16384, 0);
        write(fd, &c, 1);
        close(fd);
}
but I tried it and it gives the correct result (a 16384 bytes long file
with only the first few bytes non-zeroed).
