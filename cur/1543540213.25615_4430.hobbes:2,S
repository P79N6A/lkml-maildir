This 'problem' only affects the root partition, so it should hardly be
a major concern. I have planned at some point to implement
   'mount -o remount,lock'
as a remedy, but that will probably require some work on lockd as well
in order to avoid allowing people to play silly buggers with turning
it off while locks are held...
Cheers,
