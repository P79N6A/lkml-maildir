I couldn't find a more appropriate place to ask this question, so here
goes.
Does anyone have any experience getting any wireless LAN products up and
running in Linux?  My wireless vendor assures my that the Lucent WaveLAN
products are Linux compatible, but I have been unable to track down any
proof. 
Please CC my personal account, as I rarely have time to read the list
anymore.
