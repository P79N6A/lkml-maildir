Precisely.
Note that by "store the image entirely" we mean everything that cannot
be saved COW - so memory pages are not duplicated; the rest of the data
tends to take less than 5-10% of the total size.
Buffering the checkpoint image in kernel is useful to reduce downtime
during checkpoint, and also useful for super-fast rollback of a task
(or container) by always keeping everything in memory.
This abstraction is also useful for restart, e.g. to implement read-ahead
of the checkpoint image into the kernel.
Note also that in the future we will have larger headers (e.g. to record
the state of a socket), and there may be some nested calls (e.g. to dump
a connected unix-domain socket we will want to first save the "parent"
listening socket, and also there is nesting in restart).
Instead of using the stack for some headers and memory allocation for
other headers, this abstraction provides a standard interface for all
checkpoint/restart code (and the actual implementation may vary for
different purposes).

Yes, something like that, except you can do without the reference count
since the buffer is tied to 'struct cr_ctx'; so this is what I had in
mind:
In non-buffering mode - as it is now - cr_kwrite() will write the data out.
In buffering mode (not implemented yet), cr_write() will either do nothing
(if we borrow from the current code, that uses a temp buffer), or attach
the 'struct cr_buf' to the 'struct cr_ctx' (if we borrow Dave's suggestion
above).
In buffering mode, we'll also need 'cr_writeout()' which will write out
the entire buffer to the 'struct file'.  (This function will do nothing
in non-buffering mode).
Finally, the buffers will be freed when the 'struct cr_ctx' is cleaned.
