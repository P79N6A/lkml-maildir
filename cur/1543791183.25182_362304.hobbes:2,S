Hello.
A supplier of a PCI mezzanine digital IO card has provided a linux 2.4
driver as source code.  They have provided this code source with a
license stating I won't redistribute it in anyway.
My concern is that if I build this code into a module, I won't be able
to distribute it to customers without violating either the GPL (by not
distributing the source code), or the proprietary source code license
as currently imposed by the supplier.
From what I have read, this concern is only valid if the binary module
is considered to be a 'derived work' of the kernel.  The module source
directly includes the following kernel headers :
#include <linux/kernel.h>
#include <linux/types.h>
#include <linux/fs.h>
#include <linux/errno.h>
#include <linux/wrapper.h>
#include <linux/module.h>
#include <linux/iobuf.h>
#include <linux/highmem.h>
#include <asm/uaccess.h>
#include <linux/mm.h>
#include <asm/unistd.h>
Does this make the compiled module a derived work?  Are the 'static
inlines' from the headers substantial enough?
I really want to have a clear understanding of the issues before
contacting the supplier.  Any advice would be very much appreciated.
Kind regards,
Alex
