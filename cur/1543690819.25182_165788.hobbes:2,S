This appears to be the correct diagnosis. I applied your
patch to 2.4.22 and the Omnibook now correctly restarts the
network after a suspend. Vielen dank!
What's the status of a patch like this? It's obviously of
use to more than one person, and it took me a great deal of
time to find you and your solution -- I suspect fainter
hearted folk might just have given up and said "Linux
doesn't work with this combination of hardware" which would
have been a shame.
I haven't tried it with 2.6 yet; I don't normally get into
test kernels, but I might try out of curiosity. I'll post
the result if anyone indicates that it's a worthwhile thing
to do.

I think I got that too, at least, reinserting the card caused
a lockup.  With the patch applied I can eject and reinsert,
which is fortunate because there seems to be another problem
where the card switches off when I switch VCs, but it's hard
to reproduce. (and inconvenient because /usr is on nfs on
this machine)
  Thanks again,
