That is true, but it should not reserve a great deal of memory on
small memory machines. ZONE_NORMAL reservation may not even be too
noticeable as you'll usually have ZONE_NORMAL allocations during
the course of normal running.
Although it is true that there haven't been many problems attributed
to this, one example I can remember is when we fixed the __alloc_pages
watermark code, we fixed a bug that was reserving much more ZONE_DMA
than it was supposed to. This cased all those page allocation failure
problems. So we raised the atomic reserve, but that didn't bring
ZONE_DMA reservation back to its previous levels.
"So the buffer between GFP_KERNEL and GFP_ATOMIC allocations is:
2.6.8      | 465 dma, 117 norm, 582 tot = 2328K
2.6.10-rc  |   2 dma, 146 norm, 148 tot =  592K
patch      |  12 dma, 500 norm, 512 tot = 2048K"
So we were still seeing GFP_DMA allocation failures in the sound code.
You recently had to make that NOWARN to shut it up.
OK this is a fairly lame example... but the current code is more or
less just lucky that ZONE_DMA doesn't usually fill up with pinned mem
on machines that need explicit ZONE_DMA allocations.
