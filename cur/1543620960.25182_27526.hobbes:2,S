There are several problems with that:
1 - built into the kernel it is compressed and needs a tool to read
2 - the reason kernels are compressed is to make them fit in small boot
    media, so adding something to the image is not to be done lightly.
3 - modules are NOT compressed, and can be read with the strings command.
4 - other files in the modules directory are pure text and if the config
    was just text it could be read with `cat.'
