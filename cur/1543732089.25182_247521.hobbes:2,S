ok, i've upped that value in my tree too.

since your traces do show those 'mystic' latency incidents causing
200-500 usec overhead in few-instructions code paths, perhaps the 1 msec
jitter you are seeing could a consequence of this too. So perhaps it
would make sense to first try disabling IDE DMA, to see whether this has
any effect on the magic latencies.
