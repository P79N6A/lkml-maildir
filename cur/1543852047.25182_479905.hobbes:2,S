This got me wondering what PCI_VDEVICE was, so I went looking.
It's a libata'ism it seems with the comment..
/* move to PCI layer? */
Which sounds like a good idea to me.  But until this is moved,
does quirks.c actually compile with this patch? I don't see
an include of linux/libata.h there.
When it gets moved to the PCI layer, I wonder if it'd be worth
doing the same thing to the second argument, so that we'd be
able to do..
	{ PCI_VDEVICE(VIA, VIA_8233_0), 17},
Or maybe even..
	{ PCI_VDEVICE(VIA, 8233_0), 17},
?
