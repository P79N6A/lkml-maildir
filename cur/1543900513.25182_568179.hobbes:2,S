Thanks for the effort!
Couple of comments tho .. You might want to change the name of the patch
to distinguish it from Ingo's patch ..
Also it would be nice to move away from the "One Big Patch" release
method , for instance if you could break it up into two or more patches
one with the stuff from the patch-2.6.21.5-rt20 which applied, and
another patch with the reject resolution. That way we can see what was
added ..
