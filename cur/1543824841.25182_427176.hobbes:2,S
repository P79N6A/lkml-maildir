You seem to be missing :
   GFP_HIGHUSER
      - Allocate pages from high memory.
   GFP_NOIO
      - Do not do any I/O at all while trying to get memory.
   GFP_NOFS
      - Do not make any fs calls while trying to get memory.
It might also make sense to document the fact that you can set
different flags by OR'ing in one or more of the following :
   __GFP_COLD
      - Request cache-cold pages instead of trying to return cache-warm pages.
   __GFP_DMA
      - Request memory from the DMA-capable zone
   __GFP_HIGH
      - This allocation is high priority and may use emergency pools.
   __GFP_HIGHMEM
      - Allocated memory may be from highmem.
   __GFP_NOFAIL
      - Indicate that this allocation is in no way allowed to fail
(think twice before using).
   __GFP_NORETRY
      - If memory is not imidiately available, then give up at once.
   __GFP_NOWARN
      - If allocation fails, don't issue any warnings.
   __GFP_REPEAT
      - If allocation fails initially, try once more before failing.
Btw: how about vmalloc() do we need to document that one as well
(didn't check) ?
