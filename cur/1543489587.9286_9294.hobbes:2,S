I'm using a dual PII 300Mhz with 128M and a FireGL 1000 Pro, using the
XF86_3DLabs server under 2.2.3 - no problems so far.
Which version of the X server do you have?  The original (from XFree86
3.3.3.0) had a problem which (horrendously) messed up the system
timer... it would bring my system to a crawl almost instantly (under
2.2.0-preX at the time), requiring a reboot to get everything properly
reset.  This is fixed in version 3.3.3.1.
