Hi all,
is there a reason why the isapnp device id are mangled this way:
drivers/pnp/isapnp_proc.c
static void isapnp_devid(char *str, unsigned short vendor, unsigned short device)
{
        sprintf(str, "%c%c%c%x%x%x%x",
                        'A' + ((vendor >> 2) & 0x3f) - 1,
                        'A' + (((vendor & 3) << 3) | ((vendor >> 13) & 7)) - 1,
                        'A' + ((vendor >> 8) & 0x1f) - 1,
                        (device >> 4) & 0x0f,
                        device & 0x0f,
                        (device >> 12) & 0x0f,
                        (device >> 8) & 0x0f);
}
This results in output like:
CSCd937 CSC0000
Which I have to un-mangle ... :-( What is the reason for not outputting
simple hex?
Sincerely,
- René
