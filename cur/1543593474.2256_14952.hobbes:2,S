 Then how does OSF/1, especially the dynamic linker, know if a binary
needs 32-bit addressing?  I suppose we could use the same way of
selection.
 Hmm...:
$ uname -mprsv
OSF1 V4.0 1091 alpha alpha
$ file /usr/bin/X11/real-netscape
/usr/bin/X11/real-netscape:     COFF format alpha dynamically linked,
demand paged executable or object module stripped - version 3.11-8
$ odump -D /usr/bin/X11/real-netscape | grep FLAGS
                       FLAGS: 0x40000001
$ odump -D /usr/bin/X11/xterm | grep FLAGS
                       FLAGS: 0x00000001
A wild guess: the 32-bit flag is bit 30.
 A second attempt (after a bit of searching in /usr/include):
$ grep ADDRESSES /usr/include/elf_mips.h
#define RHF_USE_31BIT_ADDRESSES     0x40000000
Ah, here it is.  Remember OSF/1 was running on MIPS (DECstation) first and
they never used ELF but apparently reused a few of its properties.
 So what is needed is already in place and ready to use.
