I've applied the patch, it does not improve the things.
The problem seems to be related with a DMA :
[root@debian-f5ibh] ~ # hdparm -iv /dev/hda2
/dev/hda2:
multcount    =  1 (on)
IO_support   =  1 (32-bit)
unmaskirq    =  0 (off)
using_dma    =  0 (off)
keepsettings =  0 (off)
readonly     =  0 (off)
readahead    =  8 (on)
geometry     = 3649/255/63, sectors = 29302560, start = 9767520
HDIO_GET_IDENTITY failed: Invalid argument
[root@debian-f5ibh] ~ # hdparm -d1 /dev/hda2
/dev/hda2:
setting using_dma to 1 (on)
HDIO_SET_DMA failed: Invalid argument
using_dma    =  0 (off)
