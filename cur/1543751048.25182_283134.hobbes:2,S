This code is broken. Please copy the fixes from the other
drivers/serial/*.c files as you've copied a bug from the reference code.
There are some other small cleanups in the base code that are worth
adding too in particular removing direct (ab)use of tty->flip. because
that will be changing some time in the future (when I finish debugging
the tty layer mess)
