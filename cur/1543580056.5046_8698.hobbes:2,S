I understand a large portion of the kernel 2.4 networking code was updated 
and/or completely replaced. Under 2.2 I have ipchains configured to do 
basic masquerading for my local LAN. Is there a straightforward guide which 
describes how to do masquerading and firewalling with 2.4 after moving up 
from 2.2?
Thanks,
Alec
