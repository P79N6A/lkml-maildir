On a 2.4.21 kernel (kernel.org + KDB patch + MITRE security patches),
I've seen bizarre (I think) behavior from kswapd.
My question boils down to this: given the (simple) scenario below,
am I missing critical VM/kswapd patches, or is this behavior
expected and OK, or is it wrong and possibly fixed in the 2.6 kernel?
Or is the kswapd behavior somehow tunable to avoid the apparent
thrashing that I saw?
I had a large source tree on an ext3 filesystem on machine A, and
did a 'make' from machine B via NFS. Then I did the equivalent of
'make clean' on machine A itself, and instead of taking maybe 30
seconds, the clean took 10  minutes. During all of that time, kswapd
ran at around 50% CPU, and kjournald was also extremely busy:
   PID USER      PR  NI  VIRT  RES  SHR S %CPU %MEM    TIME+  COMMAND
49161 root      12   0   616  616  488 D 46.5  0.0   3:41.43 find

51794 root      12   0   948  948  720 R  1.7  0.0   0:02.23 top
Meanwhile, memory was pretty constant. Here's a brief snapshot:

Out of 5 GB of memory, only 1/4 GB was free, and 3.8 GB was used
by the page cache. I'm wondering if possibly the 'find/rm' that the
clean was doing freed pages in the cache and that the 5% of memory
that was free is somehow a significant number that caused kswapd
to work like crazy while the find/rm freed cached file data up.
I should say that some KDB backtrace samples from kswapd
showed that it was busy doing kswapd_balance_pgdat().
(I assume the kjournald activity is expected due to the amount of 
metadata
updates that the clean would be generating?)
Thanks,
Chris Johns
