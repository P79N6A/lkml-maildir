Hi,
I'm setting up a fileserver (24gb) for a local school. Originally, I was
planning to use a Mylex DAC960 card to do RAID 5, but due to problems with
the card I've started trying Linux software raid. Is there a way I can
make the RAID 5 be the root partition, or is that a stupid idea? Should I
instead have a non-redundant root partition? If so I suppose I would have
to make /var, /usr, and /home symlinks to those on the RAID, as I want
them all to have redundancy.
Please CC me into any responces, as I am not on the list.
Thank you.
