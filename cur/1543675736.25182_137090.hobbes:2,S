Today I realize it more signifikant here. Sometimes a pressed key hangs,
the kernel realizes not, that it was a single click. Then the Key is
repeyted until I press it once again.
Christian, do you get this error only in X or at console too?
Furthermore my ps2 kbd is usable without hotplugging it, though.
The strange thing happens very often using ssh.
In earlyer days I had a similair Problem with an SiS chipset board
@work and 2.4.x ac kernels, there only an usb keyboard is usable.
This happens only happens running X and IIRC this was/is an xfree86 bug
there.
But here @home I get this error for the 1st time with this otherwise
master piece of software being 2.5.70-mm3 :) on an i845PE chipset.
I discovered this only running X 'cause I did not do much console work
with this kernel, since it is so young :)
regards,
Konstantin
