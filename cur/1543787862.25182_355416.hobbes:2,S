Another fun consideration in that area is that XML (or s-exp, or trees,
whatever representation you prefer) has nothing to help with dynamic data
structures.  Exporting snapshots does not work since the real state
includes the information about locks being held - without that you
can't tell which invariants hold at the moment, since the real ones
include lock state.  And forcing all locks involved into known state
is nowhere near feasible, of course.  OTOH, exporting dynamic state
including locks and walking the damn thing is
	a) not feasible with XML
	b) would require giving userland way too much access to locking,
creating a nightmare wrt deadlock potential.
