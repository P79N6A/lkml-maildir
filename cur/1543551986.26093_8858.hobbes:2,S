For some reason this code is there to allow agp to be a module when drm is
built into the kernel. I don't know why - the maintainers should comment
on this one ...
It is because of get_module_symbol() in the first place (of course a
no-op without CONFIG_MODULES). I can't see a reason for this routine to
exist *at all* really. 
The only other users are 8390.h and a couple of mtd things. I don't see
why this stuff cannot be handled in userspace with /etc/modules.conf ...
should get_module_symbol() die ?
