OK. These all work for ps and top:
        /boot/System.map-2.2.10
        /boot/System.map
        /lib/modules/2.2.10/System.map
        /usr/src/linux/System.map
        /System.map
        $PS_SYSMAP
        $PS_SYSTEM_MAP
There might be other requirements set by klogd.

No, don't touch that.

The kernel doesn't need this. (it ought to provide it, to avoid
all these problems)

Nope, that is about as relevant as a Civ II game map file.
I wrote these two popular error messages:
"Warning: %s not parseable as a System.map\n"
"Warning: %s has an incorrect kernel version.\n"
They are finding problems that were being ignored. Older procps
versions (like 1.x.x) will generate garbage when you have the
wrong System.map file. Your bogus "ps axl" output is likely to
waste kernel developer time when you report bugs.
Note that you can still get bogus data! I can only check the
kernel version number. There isn't a unique ID for the kernel.
