Use the autofs filesystem to do those spooky automatic mounts.
/etc/auto.web would reduce to:
  www.cs.wisc.edu     -fstype=web,ro     
http://www.cs.wisc.edu/
 
Now write your webfs to mount and get the pages you want. Somebody was
working on an experimental ftpfs long time ago. Maybe there is still some
code left at tsx-11.mit.edu or sunsite.unc.edu. Otherwise, look at NFS and
CODA.
Oh, and what do you want to do with webservers which don't have index.html
as their default page? And also think about the fact that the webserver
won't give you a list of files when there is an index.html file.
