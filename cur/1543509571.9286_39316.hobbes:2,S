I reported similar behavior on 2.2.9 to 2.2.11 on my system in
July. Never got a fix. I since have switched to ps/2 mouse, but
for other reasons.
Search the archivees for bezerko mouse (Both linux-SMP and
linux-kernel), as there were others that had this problem.
Try switching to a virtual console when this happens Ctrl-Alt F1
then switch back Ctrl-Alt-F7 and see if it goes away. if it does
there is your fix.
That was the only solution that I got.
