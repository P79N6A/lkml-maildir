I agree.  jackstart should always call jackd.  I ran into a similar
problem a few weeks ago when I gave a demo on my laptop and didn't have
time to patch my kernel.  I wasn't doing any serious recording so I
thought I'd run without -R.  Of course, that didn't work until I changed
qjackctl to use 'jackd' as a command rather than 'jackstart'.  This
could be a serious problem for a less experienced user.
