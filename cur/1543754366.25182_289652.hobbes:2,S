FWIW I've noticed something quirky. I guess this is only likely to show
up in a contrived scenario, but I have actually reproduced this (by
accident, even), so maybe it's worth mentioning.
1. System is booted with both APM and ACPI disabled. (To be exact, ACPI
is not compiled into the kernel I tested in this case, and APM is, but
the BIOS lacks APM support.)
2. Ultra-minimal /sbin/init does shutdown syscall.
3. "Shutdown: hda
    Power down."
You (or I, at least) would expect things to stop here, but we enter the
Twilight Zone instead:
4. "Kernel panic - not syncing: Attempted to kill init!" (Nothing this
weird ever happens if I have ACPI enabled. In that case it either
freezes or properly shuts down.)
5. The admin (that's me) then tries to reboot box without resorting to the
power or reset buttons. (Actually the chassis in this case doesn't have
a reset button, and I want to avoid unnecessarily power-cycling the
thing.)
Without the i8259 shutdown patch applied, I can reboot with Alt-SysRq-B.
With the patch, the computer doesn't respond to Alt-SysRq-B and I have
to use the power button.
If anyone's interested, the source code to my minimal /sbin/init is
here:

The problem occurs even with no other kexec patches applied. And
applying all kexec patches except the i8259 shutdown patch fails to
reproduce the problem.

It's only happening on 1 of 4 tested boxes here, too (the other three
are not affected, but they don't have the same motherboard either). :(
