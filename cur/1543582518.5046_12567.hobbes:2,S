IMO you can't safely delay the release of the dummy entry without help of
vfs. Are these dummy entries always properly released?
It seems I forgot about the subtree check, so it seems a fs that can't
provide a get_parent, can only be exported completely?

AFAIK this is already done in the generic code (in path_walk(), which is 
also called by vfs_follow_link()).
