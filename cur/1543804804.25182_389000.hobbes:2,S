Right, but we currently have this problem everywhere throughout the
code.  Avoiding it by not taking references doesn't look to be the right
way to go because then we have to dismantle the whole refcounting
infrastructure.

Sorry ... forgot to mention that part ... the change from _del to
_remove ties us up with a wait for the list to actually remove.  This is
potentially dangerous because you're waiting on events you don't
control.  Additionally, next_child isn't refcounted, so it could
potentially disappear out from under you.
