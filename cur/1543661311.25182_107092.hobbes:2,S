I doubt that there is a bug in vmalloc or kmalloc as you state because
the machine wouldn't work at all. So, I tried to download your sources.
The file web-page claims that it's a ".bz2" file. However, once
downloaded, it becomes a "*.tar.tar" file (whatever that is). An attempt
to extract it with `tar` as `tar -xzf` fails, as does `tar -xf`. Attempts
to un-bz2 it with bzip2 or even bzip2recover fails also.
So, if you want some help finding the problems, please email me
a 'tar.gz` file directly.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson

Why is the government concerned about the lunatic fringe? Think about it.
