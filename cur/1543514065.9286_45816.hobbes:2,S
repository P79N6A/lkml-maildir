   No.
   Aside from some value of backwards compatability, /proc/pci is useful
   as it stands right now with (for example)
      Vendor id=1106. Device id=8598.
   which a well-behaved userland can pick up in a much cleaner fashion
   than having to hope that userland keeps up with the explosion in
   PCI devices.
