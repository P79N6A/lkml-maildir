Er, sorry old man, but WindozeXPPro certainly does use the extra processors 
with HT. I'm not talking about Task Manager (which of course shows four 
processors) but the multi-threaded secure gateway application I'm developing 
confirms the multiple (and virtual) processors.
In fact, Windoze2kPro has a different threading kernel to WIndozeXPPro, which 
is why you get four procs in XPPro and only two in 2kPro. Anyway, this isn't 
the thread or forum for this topic. I don't use Doze for anything other than 
compatibility testing so it's a (fairly) moot point. I'm only interested in 
improving Linux (since I develop on and for it) and if this investigation 
helps, then marvellous.
Cheers
