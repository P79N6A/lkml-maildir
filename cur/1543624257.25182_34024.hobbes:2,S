smbmount from certain samba versions always negotiate unicode support.
smbfs should probably turn on it's internal unicode support when it sees
that, but right now it doesn't.
samba 2.2.1 is known to error this way, 2.2.3 should be fixed.
One workaround should be to pass codepage=unicode or to specify unicode as
the CONFIG_SMB_NLS_DEFAULT. Another to upgrade samba.
Please post the exact output of a few filenames as well as the expected
names if none of the above helps.
