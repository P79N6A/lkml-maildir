I'm not so sure...
I've been using this driver for a long time,
and there still are kernel Ooops and hangs
with the 1.32 driver...
Actually, it's quite stable, but only with 5 M
speed. It's a pity when your card can drive
a SCSI bus up to 40 M/s....
But, even with that speed, I got problems
from time to time....
So, you should take a good care of what you do...
But, maybe it shold be integrated into the kernel
so a lot of people could test and (maybe) debut it...
