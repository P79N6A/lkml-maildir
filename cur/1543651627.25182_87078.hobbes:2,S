That charcater count includes all the comments as well. It may not be
much but it is not insignificant.
# wc -c .config
  22174 .config
# grep "^#\? \?CONFIG_"  .config | wc -c
  20623

Dropping "CONFIG_" and "# CONFIG_" will definitely reduce memory
requirements. We do not want to drop the lines "# CONFIG_* is not set".
If you do that, you end up having to answer lots of questions when
running "make oldconfig".

It IS in the kernel image. Use scripts/extract-ikconfig to extract it
from the kernel image file. And if you only need it to be in kernel
image, you can choose to not have it under /proc.
