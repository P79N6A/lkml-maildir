Hi Jaswinder,
I'll look closer but I had assumed that these masks would not be
used for UP configurations (it did not get any compile errors
with the allnoconfig).  In fact, any access to these masks for
UP would be unnecessary since there are no callouts, the boot
cpu is assumed initialized, and it has no siblings.  So the
masks are specific to SMP.
But as I said, I'll verify this.
Thanks,
Mike
