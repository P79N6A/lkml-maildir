I haven't done any comparisons with other vendor offerings, but I can
highly recommend the Myricom PCI-Express (8x) 10-GigE NICs.  They only
cost about $900 and can do full unidirectional 10-GigE line rate.  And
as a 10-GigE router, they can do full bidirectional 10-GigE line rate
IP forwarding.  Note the choice of system/motherboard/CPU is as
important as the choice of NIC in achieving maximum performance.
Sample nuttcp test:
chance7 -> chance9 10-second TCP test:
[root@chance7 ~]# nuttcp -w10m 192.168.88.16
11817.8125 MB /  10.00 sec = 9909.8073 Mbps 100 %TX 71 %RX
The system specs are:
Tyan Thunder K8WE S2895ANRF motherboard with Nvidia nForce
Professional 2200+2050 chipset, 2 AMD Opteron 254 2.8 GHz CPUs,
4 GB PC3200 ECC REG-DDR 400 memory, and 2 PCI-Express x16 slots
(2 buses).  The systems are running a 2.6.20.7 kernel.
Perhaps others can share their experiences with 10-GigE NICs.
