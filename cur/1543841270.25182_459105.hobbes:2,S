I think I'll just slam all this in at the first opportunity.  Stuff will
break, but it will be easy to fix.
If you try to upissue this patchset I shall be seeking an IP-routable hand
grenade.

This function is misnamed and is implemented in the wrong place.  It's not
really a block thing at all.  If/when/soon NFS starts to implement it and
call it, things will need to be renamed and reshuffled.
Simply stubbing it out like this will cause general mayhem and CPU meltdown
all over the writeback and page-reclaim code.
So...  for now, I'll replace it with a simple io_schedule_timeout(timeout),
which is equivalent to what we do now for network filesystems.
