I was speaking of the setaffinity (not getaffinity) case -- I assumed
this was what you were referring to since I couldn't find any calls to
the cpuset code in the getaffinity path.

I'm only recommending not changing the current behavior of
sched_getaffinity.
(BTW - cpu_possible_map can be a subset of CPU_MASK_ALL on some
platforms -- powerpc, at least, since we can discover the number of
truly possible cpus early in boot.)
