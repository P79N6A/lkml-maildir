Does anyone have a good patchset that has
XFS
O(1)
Preempt (preferably with lockbreak or low-latency)
IDE drivers for the new ATA-133 and 48bit addressing IDE cards?
Other toys, like rmap and such would be fun as well.
I've tried applying O(1) and preempt to the SGI CVS, but it didn't go 
cleanly. More like "it went like a politician mud-wrestling a 
televangelist while a daytime talkshow host and a sleazy lawyer looked on".
