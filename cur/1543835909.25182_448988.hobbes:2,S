I agree, we want to use the mainline kernel for omap. Most of the core
omap code is already integrated, now we just need to get few more
omap device drivers integrated to have mainline kernel usable for
most omap boards.

I agree. After the omap I2C driver has been integrated, we should
provide patches for few more omap defconfigs.

Sorry, my fault, I've been on vacation for most of July.

Good to hear the patches mentioned above fix the compile problem :)
