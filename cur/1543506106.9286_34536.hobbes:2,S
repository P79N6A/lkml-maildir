Modifying the kernel can make it very easy to hide what's going on. Without
kernel modifications ps could always be run from a write protected floppydisk,
and always show all processes. With a modified kernel, you could be made to see
only the bashes, logins, telnetds and ugly little vi's.

Nope, it wasn't the negative reaction as much as the arguments of it being more
