The default behaviour should be at least reasonable.  If you have
multiple threads in accept, then yes, you'll get thundering herd in the
kernel: all threads in wait_for_connect() will be made runnable.
However, the scheduler will prefer to actually schedule those threads
which are already on the best CPU, so those threads will tend to be the
ones which win the accept().  The other threads will get scheduled later
and will either find another connection ready to be accepted, or will
sleep again without ever leaving the accept syscall.
Doing a real wake-one is more difficult, but sysV ipc semaphores should
at least avoid thundering herd.  If you have one demutiplexor thread
adding work to a queue and waking up worker threads by up()ing a sysV
semaphore, exactly one thread at a time will be woken up.  That _will_
be done in strict FIFO, however, but if you have multiple CPUs idle at
the time the thread will end up being scheduled on its last CPU
(assuming it was last run on one of the idle processors).
