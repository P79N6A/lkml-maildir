So the previous didn't exactly improve interactivity.
This one seems to be better. Major thing is microsecond timeslice
accounting. Other small fixes related to the microsecond stuff.
No idea what this has done to context switch and wake up performance,
but it should be able to be improved a bit.
I've made patches for Linus and Andrew's trees.
