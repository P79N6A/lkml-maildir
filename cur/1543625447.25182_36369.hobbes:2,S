It might do, but I couldn't compile it against 2.4.19-pre3-ac3, and with
the three hdparm parameters, I was still generating skips on 2.4.18+akm
with just file copying.
When 2.4.19 proper is out I'll do the rounds again when the patches
are available (and, in time, figure out how to use a proper latency
measuring tool - so my test reports might become useful to someone other than
myself).
Lock-break patch also didn't apply to 2419pre3ac3 either. Anyway, I can
play mp3s which is a starting point for me. Next I need to get a
hammerfall 9652 card working in a desktop so my band can start digital
recording.
I had read akm's 'things not to do' but for some reason missed the
hdparm stuff.
In summary, what is currently working for me: on a new DELL
Inspiron 8100 laptop, Maestro 3i sound, 1GHz Pentium ('Pentium III' I
assume), 60G HDD, Radeon Mobility 7500 64MB, DRI and framebuffer compiled into
kernel:
  Linux 2.4.19-pre3-ac3 + preemptible kernel patch
  hdparm -c 1 -d 1 -u 1 /dev/hda
Thanks for everything,
zen
