	David,
	In the linux-wlan-ng, I did implement a different algorithm to
report signal/noise in /proc/net/wireless, based on various info on
the list. Mark Matthews did check with some people and told me it was
the right algorithm for the Intersil firmware.
	Note that I'm not sure we ever got it right.
	Also, in the past, we had the min/max wrapper that avoided
"strange" values, and I think that's what people are mostly
complaining about. So, maybe we should reintroduce the min/max.
	Regards,
	Jean
