The patch to GNU tar isn't necessary.  If the "not crash, and behave
like a regular UNIX program" can be satisfied, I'd be happy to support
7zip/lzma on kernel.org.  Unfortunately, as far as I can tell:
a) right now the standard encapsulation format for LZMA is 7zip, which
only comes in the form of hideously ugly code.  lzma-tools are
cleaner, but incompatible.
b) Even lzma-tools relies on a shell script to behave like a Unix
program.
Personally, I would like to suggest adding LZMA capability to gzip.
The gzip format already has support for multiple compression formats.
