Subject: [linux-usb-devel] Long delay on serial-usb echo readback

I have the following setup:
FTDI USB->Serial chip hooked up to a CAN signaling transceiver.
Due to the nature of CAN, I automatically get local echo back through
the FTDI chip.
I'm not using the CAN protocol, but just its signaling properties.
The problem I am having is everytime I write something I must read
back what I've written in order to read back correct data from the
device it is hooked up to, because of CAN having hardware echo.
I am finding that if the string that I send is long enough (usually
greater than 22 bytes in most cases), the FTDI chip splits the
response into at least two IN data packets.
Unfortunately there is a large delay between these two packets (for a
write of 64 bytes its usually around 19ms @ 115200 baud).
I'm wondering if this delay can be shortened or if it is the result of
USB hardware on either end (either the FTDI chip or the USB
hardware/stack on the computer side).
This is with vanilla linux-2.6.11.
A sample transaction with lots of debugging looks like the following:
