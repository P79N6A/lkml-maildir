If you're using posix locking, you'll never find yourself busy-waiting for very 
long.  Use ps or top.

Use ps or top.

Use ps or top.  You'll have to decide how much is "too much".

This requires solving the Halting Problem.  If your management is demanding this 
feature, I suggest informing them that it is mathematically impossible.
Just use top or ps.  Don't reinvent the wheel.  We've got a really good wheel. 
If you don't like top or ps as is, read the ps man page to see all the fancy 
formatting it can do, and parse it with a simple script in your favorite 
scripting language.
