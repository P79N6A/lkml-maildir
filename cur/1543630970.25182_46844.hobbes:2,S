Note that the generic VM code doesn't actually call any of these functions
directly - an architecture can choose to redefine the whole thing for its
own uses if it wants to.
In particular, even if the architecture wants to share everything else in
the generic tlb.h, you can solve the particular problem you mention by
just not defining "pmd_free_tlb()" to be "tlb_remove_page()". In short:
there should be absolutely nothing in the setup that _requires_ you to
consider page directories to be normal pages. It just happens to work out
that way on x86 (and a number of other architectures).
