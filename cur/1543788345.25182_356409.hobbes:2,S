You know, I was thinking, ext3 could be much more compact if it was just a 
set of custom syscalls and had no VFS representation.
What about a per process /proc/pid/keys, which contains keyrings and keys, 
which can be opened, closed, use xattrs for any special access control 
etc. ?

Possibly for setperm and chown.

Well, SELinux is the only significant LSM in the tree and I don't think it 
needs to set the labels.  So, no.

Ok, if needed, it can be added later.

Because the LSM has final say on the error code returned to the caller.  
If the LSM runs out of memory, for example, it's silly to return -EACCES.

Ok, that sounds like an internal issue to be resolved, ensuring that if 
you are returning to the caller, the LSM's error code is returned.
