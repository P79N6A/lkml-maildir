Sorry for the delay. Somehow this thread was put into the spam folder
of my gmail box. :(
The patch I posted several days ago works properly on my side. I'm
working on blackfin-uclinux platform. So I'm not sure it works 100% on
the other arch platform. From O_DIRECT threads, I know different
people suffer from VFS pagecache issue for different reason. So I
really hope the patch can be improved.
On my side, When VFS pagecache eat up all of the available memory,
applications who want to allocate the largeish block(order =4 ?) will
fail. So the logic is as follows:
if request pagecache
      watermark =  min + reserved_pagecache.
else
      watermark =  min.
Here, assume min=123 pages, reserved_pagecache = 200 pages. That means
when VFS pagecache eat up its all of available memory, there are still
200 pages available for the allocation of the application. Does that
make sense?

That's true. I wrote a replacement of buddy system, it's here:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/12/30/36.
That can improve the fragmentation problems on our platform.
Christoph - I can't find your original patch, Can you send me again?
it would be great if you merged all of the  enhancement.
Thanks,
