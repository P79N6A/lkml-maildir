NAK. Warnings do not need to be "fixed", then need to be looked at and 
then there are two approaches:
 1) GCC is wrong => annotate the code
 2) GCC is right => fix the code
Your patch does not give us any idea about which case this is, whether 
you have analyzed the reason why GCC emitted that warning.
Besides, i dont see such warnings in kernel/module.c with latest GCC.
