Right, that's a pre-req.

Well... There should be no problem with
add-try_acquire_console_sem.patch and
update-aty128fb-sleep-wakeup-code-for-new-powermac-changes.patch.
radeonfb is another story, but the newer patch is definitely less
invasive. It really just fixes bugs and adds the bulk of PM stuff to
wakeup the newer chips, plus some backlight changes. It's been tested by
pmac users for a while, the only reason I sent it to you only recently
is that i was away for a month !
I'm hesitating about having it in 2.6.11 tho due to linus wanting to
release real soon, I'd rather have a bit more non-ppc testing just in
case though... but now it depends entirely on when linus plans to get
2.6.11 out of the door.
