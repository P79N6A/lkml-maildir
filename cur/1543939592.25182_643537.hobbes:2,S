Subject: [PATCH 11 of 11] x86: defer cr3 reload when doing pud_clear()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/25/543

PAE mode requires that we reload cr3 in order to guarantee that
changes to the pgd will be noticed by the processor.  This means that
in principle pud_clear needs to reload cr3 every time.  However,
because reloading cr3 implies a tlb flush, we want to avoid it where
possible.
pud_clear() is only used in a couple of places:
 - in free_pmd_range(), when pulling down a range of process address space, and
 - huge_pmd_unshare()
In both cases, the calling code will do a a tlb flush anyway, so
there's no need to do it within pud_clear().
In free_pmd_range(), the pud_clear is immediately followed by
pmd_free_tlb(); we can hook that to make the mmu_gather do an
unconditional full flush to make sure cr3 gets reloaded.
In huge_pmd_unshare, it is followed by flush_tlb_range, which always
results in a full cr3-reload tlb flush.
