Sure go ahead and fine grain it, I had no time to go that much into
detail when ripping out io_request_lock. A drive->lock passed to
blk_init_queue would do nicely.
But beware that ide locking is a lot nastier than you think. I saw other
irq changes earlier, I just want to make sure that you are _absolutely_
certain that these changes are safe??
