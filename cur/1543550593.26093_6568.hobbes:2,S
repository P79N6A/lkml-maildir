I am having Andrew McCullough review these patents to determine if there
are any infringement issues that may affect us.  Whomever is concerned
her, if it would not be too much trouble, please forward what
documentation and patent no.'s to wandrew@timpanogas.org and copy me at
jmerkey@timpanogas.org and we will forward them to Malinkrodt &
Malinkrodt in Salt Lake City.  I'll pay them to do a patent infringment
analysis, and post their analysis to interested/affected parties.
