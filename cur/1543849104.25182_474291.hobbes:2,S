I agree that those tables in sysctl.h are a right royal pita to maintain. 
And there sure is a lot of gunk in there which it would be nice to scrap.
So Andi's plan sounds reasonable to me - it'd only take a few lines to
implement sysctl(CTL_KERN/KERN_VERSION) as a back-compat thing (and it'll
be faster!).  And we add a printk so we find out which other sysctls (if
any) are being used in the wild.
