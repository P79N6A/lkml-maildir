The majority of paravirt_ops entrypoints are things which are currently
exported as inline functions in headers anyway.  There isn't a lot which
would become available to modules under a CONFIG_PARAVIRT kernel which
isn't already available to a non-CONFIG_PARAVIRT kernel.
We can hide the few remaining entries, I suppose.  But any module which
used them would only work with a PARAVIRT kernel anyway, so its hardly
going to be the best course for a module author - assuming they're at
all useful anyway (ooh, look, we can activate an mm!).
If we want to address this consistently, then we could scatter a pile of
#ifndef MODULEs around the headers to make sure the inlines are not
visible to modules in either case.  And we could correspondingly nobble
paravirt_ops by masking unexported entries with #ifndef MODULE.
So it isn't worth worrying about the paravirt_ops export unless you also
deal with the non-PARAVIRT case.
