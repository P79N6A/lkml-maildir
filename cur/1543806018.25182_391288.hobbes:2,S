Further info, possibly in support of your suggestion, possibly not: the
problem does *not* occur with NFS-over-TCP. So it's specific to UDP,
this hardware (perhaps motherboard or network card, see the .config
diff), *and* NFS. Other UDP stuff (e.g. DNS) gets through fine in both
directions; NFS works with TCP; and the whole lot worked before the
hardware was changed.
At this point though I'd say that it's really rather unlikely to be
purely hardware at fault.

No need now, I can make it appear and disappear on demand.
