Huh? I frequently update the kernel, and the kernel minor version... as
well as switch from uniprocessor to SMP. The major version may not change,
but that minor one certanly does. And adding SMP changes the ABI for
that version. And patches CAN and DO change the ABI, even within the
major version.

How do you handle the differences in a single version for something like
SMP? It is still the same version, but a binary driver for SMP will most
likely NOT work on uniprocessor, and even more likey not work if compiled
for a uniprocessor under SMP.
