It's a design principle that you must not call "current" in interrupt,
bottom half or tasklet context.  From time to time buggy code is found
to do this, and it gets away with it.  (See recent thread on network I/O
signal delivery using the wrong credentials due to a bug like this).
So if you can make the machine crash utterly when calling "current" in
irq context, or when dereferencing the result, that would probably be a
good thing :-)
