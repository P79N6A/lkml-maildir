What hardware is crappy here. Lets say... internal hdd in thinkpad
x60?
What are ext3 expectations of disk (is there doc somewhere)? For
example... if disk does not lie, but powerfail during write damages
the sector -- is ext3 still going to work properly?
If disk does not lie, but powerfail during write may cause random
numbers to be returned on read -- can fsck handle that?
What abou disk that kills 5 sectors around sector being written during
powerfail; can ext3 survive that?
