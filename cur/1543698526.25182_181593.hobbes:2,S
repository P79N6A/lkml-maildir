"mount --bind" certainly has a good chance of confusing nfsd.
If you --bind mount the root of the filesystem somewhere else and
export that, then the filehandles generated will be exactly the same
and nfsd cannot know whether a request is indented for one mountpoint
or the other.
When using --bind, it is best to give an 'fsid=' option in
/etc/exports so that nfsd can use that to differentiate the mount
points.

This strongly suggests that nfsd thought that the user making the
request didn't have 'x' access to the parent of 'dc'. i.e. to /hannes.

And if you are not exporting with no_root_squash, then the user does
not have 'x' access to hannes.
So if you haven't exported with 'no_root_squash', then this completely
makes sense. The nfs client is allowing root access (based on cached
data that some other local users recently accessed) but the server is
not allowing root access. 
Arguably you should be getting "permission denied" rather than
"stale", but you certainly shouldn't expect it to work.
If, on the other hand, you have specified no_root_squash, then this is
still very strange.
What export options are you using?
