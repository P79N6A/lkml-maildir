First things I'd pick on are the obvious ones - we have headers defining
KERN_ERR etc as <1> so use them 8)
Second you probably want to use the pci_module_init api then multiple
cards will basically just work, cardbus will just work and even hotplug
should come for free.
Beyond that you get the pci resources correctly, you enable the device
first as you should. You then ruin it all by poking around directly into
I/O space you have not mapped.
The kernel isn't running in physical space, and on other platforms it
gets even more exciting as to what goes on. Its all abstracted do
	addr = ioremap(io_base_start, len);
        databuf = read(addr + 0x590);
Finally note that we have a radio interface layer as part of
video4linux. Other than some basic tuning ioctls it probably has little
in common with digital radio (assuming you mean something like
Eureka-147 (aka DAB) rather than digital tuner/mixer for analogue
radio.It would nice to make use of that API and extend it logically if
you want to get a driver into the base kernel eventually.
