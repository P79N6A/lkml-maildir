The attachment this gentleman included specifically points to 
prune_dcache().  Thats nice.  It also means I'm not alone.  See the 
'prune_dcache() Oops, the saga continues' thread.
I got in about 9pm after spending the afternoon inside a tv 
transmitter, having left the house about 1ish.  Black screen. 
keyboard leds out.  The usual.  Last log entry was at 14:49 EDT this 
afternoon.  Some file fam couldn't find message.  Whenever it went 
down, it went so fast there was no logged trace.  The next entry is 
syslogd restarting after I'd hit the reset button.
So whatever took it down, did it all by itself as the only non-system 
processes running were setiathome, X and kmail (from kde3.2, 
kde3.2.3, and kde3.3-beta2, makes no diff, all fail in 
prune_dcache() ) making an every 10 minute run to get the mail.
I *thought* I had PREEMPT turned off, but when I did a make xconfig, 
it was turned on.  So its now off, and a new 2.6.8-rc3 is building.
It was frame pointers I had turned on for the last build, still on for 
this one underway now.
