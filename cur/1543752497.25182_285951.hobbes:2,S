I think having security@ notify vendor-sec when it finds a real problem
would be a good idea, as a lot of stuff is just sifting through finding
the root cause and fix.  And if security@ still has it's "5 day
countdown" type thing, that still gives you (and me) at least a few days
to run around like mad to update things, which is better than nothing :)
