Hmm why: At the instant when only one thread has a read lock, you 
could atomically exchange it with a write lock. As long as another 
process has a read lock it's impossible. I don't see the deadlock.
(Compare it to the situation when the thread has a read lock and 
wants to have a write lock. It would release the read lock 
temporarily, then try to grab a write lock. The difference is that 
some other thread could go between possession of the read lock and 
grabbing of the write lock. (Thus the first thread in discussion 
would grab a write lock right from the start) I see no other dead 
lock as in the situation when one own a read lock, and another wants 
to have a write lock, i.e. none)

Your state X would prevent multiple threads from owning a read lock; 
my solution would not. In my solution the process wanting to upgrade 
would have to wait until all other threads have released theit read 
locks. I'm usure what your solution would imply. Not having to wait? 
Then it's actually a write lock with a different name.

But why? As you don't know how long the priviledged thread would hold 
the lock in read state, you would be denying other threads the right 
to hold a "read lock with the option to upgrade". In addition, the 
priviledged process might never upgrade to a write lock.
I'm no SMP guru, but I think you are making things unnecessarily 
complicated here.
