Heh!  I supply those boards for Linux systems all the time,
and nary a problem.  What have you done!?
Those are just plain jane BX chipset P2 boards,
with full BIOS UDMA support, and they normally work
just Great! with the stock kernel.
Exactly what BIOS do you have? (full name, not just the number).
Are you trying to overclock anything? (the AWARD BIOS has tricks for that).
Do you have UDMA set to "AUTO" for the drive(s) in question in the BIOS?
What does "cat /proc/ide/ide0/config" give us?
