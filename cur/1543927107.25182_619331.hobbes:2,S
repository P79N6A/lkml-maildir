T'was done as a21101c46ca5b4320e31408853cdcbf7cb1ce4ed.  The system is
a latitude x300 (i855GM).  With '1', the old default, I can close and
re-open the lid and have nothing happening.  With '0' the screen turns
black with the mouse cursor left frozen on top of it and the computer
crashed.
Closing the lid also raises a "video bus notify".
How can I go about debugging that?
  OG.
