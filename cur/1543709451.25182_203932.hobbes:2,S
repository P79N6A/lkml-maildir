A couple xfs users stumbled upon this problem while trying to
use 2.6 + CONFIG_LBD on ia32 boxes - mkfs.xfs followed by
xfs_repair was failing.  At first we thought it was
a raid/md problem, but it's more generic than that.  There's
a problem in __block_write_full_page():

later in the function we do:
	last_block = (i_size_read(inode) - 1) >> inode->i_blkbits;
and
	block = page->index << (PAGE_CACHE_SHIFT - inode->i_blkbits);
... these overflow 32 bits for large devices.
The sophisticated mkfs/repair test works with that patch in place.  ;)
