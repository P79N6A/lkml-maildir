Subject: [PATCH 02/25] rearrange may_open() to be r/o friendly
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

may_open() calls vfs_permission() before it does checks for
IS_RDONLY(inode).  It checks _again_ inside of vfs_permission().
The check inside of vfs_permission() is going away eventually.
With the mnt_want/drop_write() functions, all of the r/o
checks (except for this one) are consistently done before
calling permission().  Because of this, I'd like to use
permission() to hold a debugging check to make sure that
the mnt_want/drop_write() calls are actually being made.
So, to do this:
1. remove the IS_RDONLY() check from permission()
2. enforce that you must mnt_want_write() before
   even calling permission()
3. actually add the debugging check to permission()
We need to rearrange may_open() to do r/o checks
before calling permission().  Here's the patch.
