Hi!
I got Sony Vaio PCG-FX240 (on i815), and problems as Tom Winkler 
described.
Maybe you will be interested in my patch, which also makes
USB work...
Maybe it is a little narrower the prevoius ones.
I think it is worth to add 'is_sony_vaio_laptop' check in if condition...
I know that is a rather ugly hack, but maybe it can be added to kernel,
like other sony pathces... Of course it should be implemented somehow
nicer...

Plese CC me if you have any additional questions/comments.
I can send some logs, or anything...

PS.
My eepro100 card works great on 100Mbps net, and has problems
(eepro100: wait_for_cmd_done) on 10Mbs. Even if I set up
speed manually (by option to module)
