	As of right now, Fedora Core 6 has hal-0.5.8.1-6.fc6.  This is also
too old.  Please, stop claiming that Debian unstable is some corner
case.  No one is talking about Debian stable here.  No one is talking
about the Enterprise versions of Red Hat or SuSE (you'd find them just
as irritating with modern kernels).  Debian unstable tracks released
code as fast or faster than Fedora and OpenSuSE.  They all keep up with
releases.
	But the last release of hal is 0.5.8.1.  _Release_, not "release
candidate".  You can't break that.  You can't break it for a while, if
you want a sane deprecation schedule.  These are userspace interfaces.
	Matt is absolutely correct that you should't deprecate a
userspace<->kernel interface before you've even provided a release of
the tool that detects the change!
