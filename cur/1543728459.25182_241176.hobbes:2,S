OK, just saw that code now and my reponse is to remove that 
interface in the long-term and move cpuid into sysfs (and not 
export all the cache info separately). In theory we don't even 
need the xxx_bug fields as those can be determined from looking
at CPU binary data.

If it is all done in userspace, then just having the raw binary
data available via sysfs w/o kernel parsing is probably best. The
question I have is are there any cross-platform userland tools/apps
that just want to know things like cache-size w/o worrying about
CPU specifics? Even if they do, I suppose they can be fixed to read
that information from a binary blob and parse it dependent on 
the arch. ARM (other arch I really care about) could just output 
all the various ID registers into a binary blob and I am sure the
same can be done for the other arches.

Agreed, but that hasn't kept other data such as PCI and partition 
information from moving into sysfs.

Consitency in userspace interface. My understanding is that goal is to 
make /proc slowly return to it's original purpose (process-information) 
and move other data out into sysfs.
