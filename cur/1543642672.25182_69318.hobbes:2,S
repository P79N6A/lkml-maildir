Subject: [RFC] Multi-path IO in 2.5/2.6 ?

Morning everyone,
I hope people are waking up by now ;-)
So, what is the take on "multi-path IO" (in particular, storage) in 2.5/2.6?
Right now, we have md multipathing in 2.4 (+ an enhancement to that one by
Jens Axboe and myself, which however was ignored on l-k ;-), an enhancement to
LVM1 and various hardware-specific and thus obviously wrong approaches.
I am looking at what to do for 2.5. I have considered porting the small
changes from 2.4 to md 2.5. The LVM1 changes are probably and out gone, as
LVM1 doesn't work still.
I noticed that EVMS duplicates the entire md layer internally (great way to
code, really!), so that might also require changing if I update the md code.
Or can the LVM2 device-mapper be used to do that more cleanly?
I wonder whether anyone has given this some thought already.
Sincerely,
    Lars Marowsky-Brée <lmb@suse.de>
