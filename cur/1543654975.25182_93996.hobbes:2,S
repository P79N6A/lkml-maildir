My opinion...
Kernels are getting mature in the sense the there's not that many ways to do
tasking and hardware interface.  It no longer a game of invention but a game
of polishing.  The amount of total work available probably continues to go
up because kernels are becoming as common as screws.
It's like the guy who invented interchangable hardware in the
1700's...really cool and creates plenty of work but it's no longer bleeding
edge to design the next screw thread in the next material.
So, do you want to push the edge and discover new principles and go where no
one has gone before?  Or do you want to make the existing implementations
better than anyone else ever has before?
If you want to stay with programming close to the hardware, think about
pulling the essential elements of I/O drivers and some parts of applications
into VHDL and programmable hardware (FPGA's)...then hook those into the
kernel effectively and in an open architecture sort of way.
