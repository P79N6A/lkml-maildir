Unionfs and cow fs will be nice but kernel build will not use it.
Users can build a Linux kernel on other operating systems, including
Solaris, Irix, Cygwin etc.  kbuild requires a Posix compliant fs and
GNU tools, but it must not use additional fs features that only exist
on Linux or only on specific versions of Linux.
