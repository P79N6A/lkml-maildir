Ok. I think we'll probably end up needing per-device flush timers. Flushes
to jffs should work differently than flushes to disk, or to network
attached storage (iSCSI, nbd).

I think if the disk wakes up, then the time to next flush gets shortened
from long_interval to short_interval. If short_interval makes the next
flush in the past, it happens now. But if we sleep the disk and wake it up
immediately, we don't necessarily want to trigger a flush.

Haven't tried it yet, but I'm afraid I don't see what makes it actually
sync with the dirty buffer flush. Wouldn't it be better to export a chain
of flush funcs hung off a timer?
