Hi!
This patch fixes troubles when compiling some applications that include
<linux/byteorder/little_endian.h>, like xmms. When I was compiling xmms
I've got:
In file included from /usr/include/asm/byteorder.h:57,
                   from /usr/include/linux/cdrom.h:14,
                   from cdaudio.h:60,
                   from cdaudio.c:21:
/usr/include/linux/byteorder/little_endian.h:43: error: parse error
before "__cpu_to_le64p"
/usr/include/linux/byteorder/little_endian.h: In function `__cpu_to_le64p':
/usr/include/linux/byteorder/little_endian.h:45: error: `__le64'
undeclared (first use in this function)
...etc...
I've put the __le(16|32|64) and __be(16|32|64) typedefs out of #ifndef
__KERNEL_STRICT_NAMES and now everything is working. Xmms is compiling
fine, and linux kernel too. :)
Maybe I made something wrong, because this is my first patch to linux
kernel... But everything is working fine for me.
Regards,
Cadu
