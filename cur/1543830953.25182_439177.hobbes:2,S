Userspace is frozen, but kernel threads are still running. I'm therefore 
thinking of allocation of memory by drivers while we're writing the first 
part of the image (prior to the atomic copy).

My concern isn't with them allocating any memory, but with the memory 
allocation routines trying to enter the vmscan.c routines to free memory. 
This would almost certainly free some of the LRU pages we're saving 
separately prior to the atomic copy, resulting in an inconsistent image and 
crashes and/or on disk corruption post resume. I've recently seen Rafael's 
code to take pages off the LRU, and realise that may be a better solution, 
but am not sure what adverse side effects it has.
Regards,
Nigel
