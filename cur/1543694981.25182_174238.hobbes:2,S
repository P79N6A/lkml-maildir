sounds good. And unless I misread something Andrew's patch shrinking
lowmem only for highmem allocation definitely looks wrong and it would
be DoSable as well.
As for 2.4 mainline there's some bit of refill_inactive still not fully
classzone aware, it's the half merge bit mentioned earlier on the list
that also introduced a typo kind of bug. My tree is fully aware instead
to avoid falling apart on the 32G boxes in production. Those secondary
bits in refill_inactive should be merged in mainline too over time.
Anyways for a 1G machine (or maybe with 2G too), those bits could hardly
make any difference, I assume your highmem/lowmem ratio isn't too high.
