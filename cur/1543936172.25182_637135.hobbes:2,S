nonsense, and you should know it. It is perfectly possible to construct 
fully written cachelines, without reading the cacheline first. MOVDQ is 
SSE1 so on basically in every CPU today - and it is 16 byte aligned and 
can generate full cacheline writes, _without_ filling in the cacheline 
first. Bulk ops (string ops, etc.) will do full cacheline writes too, 
without filling in the cacheline. Especially with high performance 3D 
ops we do _NOT_ need any funky reads from anywhere because 3D software 
can stream a lot of writes out: we construct a full frame or a portion 
of a frame, or upload vertices or shader scripts, textures, etc.
( also, _even_ when there is a cache fill pending on for a partially
  written cacheline, that might go on in parallel and it is not 
  necessarily holding up the CPU unless it has an actual data dependency 
  on that. )
but that's totally besides the point anyway. WC or WB accesses, if a 3D 
app or a driver does high-freq change_page_attr() calls, it will _lose_ 
the performance game:

in what scenarios? Please give me in-tree examples of such high-freq 
change_page_attr() cases, where the driver authors would like to call it 
with high frequency but are unable to do it and see performance problems 
due to the WBINVD.
