Hi,
Subject says it: Can I resize a vmalloced area without copying?
There are vmalloc_area_pages/vmfree_area_pages. But I don't see a way
to use them without first 'vmallocing' the biggest possible area and
then again freeing the tail with vmfree_area_pages. And that doesn't
look like The Right Thing(TM) to me.
Thanks for all help
                        Christoph
