Hi,
There's a sytemtap example that does something similar to what you're
describing - see the kmalloc-stacks/kmalloc-top examples in the
testsuite:
systemtap/tests/systemtap.samples/kmalloc-stacks.stp
systemtap/tests/systemtap.samples/kmalloc-top
Basically, the kmalloc-stacks.stp script hashes data in a systemtap
hash and periodically formats the current contents of the hash table
into a convenient form and writes it to userspace, then clears the
hash for the next go-round.  kmalloc-top is a companion Perl script
'daemon' that sits around in userspace waiting for new batches of hash
data, which it then adds to a continuously accumulating Perl hash in
the user-side script.  There's a bit more detail about the script(s)
here:

HTH,
Tom
