Out of curiosoty, where does /dev/mouse point to? I'm having a similar
problem with 2.2.0-pre6, but my modem does not work instead of my mouse.
When I start pppd, it starts, then exits. minicom says "cannot open
/dev/ttyS2: Device or resource busy". Everything worked ok with 2.2.0p1,
so I'm not sure where things broke.
My system is a single CPU AMD 5x86-133 with 40mb RAM running Debian 2.2
(potato), all packages current.
