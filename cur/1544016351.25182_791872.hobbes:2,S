Yeah, I should test this user grouping stuff more often :/
The below fixes it for me.

Subject: sched: fix bandwidth validation for UID grouping 
For UID grouping we initialize the root group with infinite bandwidth
which by default is actually more than the global limit, therefore the
bandwidth check always fails.
Because the root group is a phantom group (for UID grouping) we cannot
runtime adjust it, therefore we let it reflect the global bandwidth
settings.
