On a related note: now that it's not necessarily current->namespace
that's used as a destination for the mount, you'll have to pass
mntpt_ns into copy_tree() and clone_mnt() so that mnt->mnt_namespace
can correctly be set.  That will also enable some cleanup in
copy_namespace(), where you can remove the of setting ->mnt_namespace.
