But isn't this kind of code a known buggy way of implementing timeouts?
Shouldn't it be like:
time_t x = time(0);
do {
   ...
} while (time(0) - x >= TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS);
Ofcourse it can't handle times in the past, but it won't get easily hung 
  with regards to leaps or wraparounds (if used with other functions).
