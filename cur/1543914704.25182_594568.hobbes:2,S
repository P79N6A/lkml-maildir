Well, if this fails, we try to power off and if that fails, we halt.
Resuming devices in case of an error is needed so that kernel_power_off()
can work, but the consoles need not be resumed for that.
Still, now that I think of it, the resuming of consoles in case of an error
will probably be useful in diagnostics.  I'll post a fix on top of this patch.
