Got 2.4.2 + ac-last patches applied.
boot impossible since it floods screen with emssages
about bugged clock (and blaming on possible VIA694 chipset).
any suggestions on patches i should apply?
P.S. initially tought its  becouse of scsi host drivers,
but at vendor ftp latest patches against 2.3.9-pre ( i assume they are mainline now ).
