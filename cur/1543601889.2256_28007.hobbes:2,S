Bullshit. killall5 is definitely *not* a well accepted method for
shutting down applications. Try doing that while your network is
running via a ppp link...
Some programs *have* to be shutdown in a certain order. All RPC
servers fall into that category.

I've no idea how you modified killall5, but if it manages to kill nfsd
before killing the portmapper, then all will work.

NFS daemons *do* perform proper cleanups. That's the whole essence of
your problem - they are waiting on the portmapper to acknowledge that
it has unregistered their service. These are *kernel* daemons and so
KILL acts just like any signal as far as they are concerned.
