Hi,
Now that Andrew Victor seems to be happy about the renaming (thanks
a lot for reviewing, Andrew), here are a few more patches to make
atmel_serial usable for AVR32, as well as a general bugfix.
I've dropped the break fix for now, as it doesn't seem to work on
my AT91RM9200-EK board. I'll see if I can fix it properly later --
it's not really a showstopper, for me anyway.
There's also a pure AVR32 patch in this set. Feel free to ignore it,
but I thought I'd include it so that you can see the whole picture.
Shortlog and diffstat for the whole series follows.
