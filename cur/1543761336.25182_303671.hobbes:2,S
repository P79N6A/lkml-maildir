Some of these things have already been done in Linus's post-2.6.11 tree and
you patch throws lots of rejects.  Please always work against the most
recent kernel - 2.6.11 is very out of date.
The patch was severely wordwrapped.  Please fix your email client and send
a test patch to yourself and ensure that it still applies OK.
