<not really a network guru - for what it's worth>
What a normal shutdown does is to issue a kill(-1,15) first, then
wait 3-5 seconds (or when it finishes other stuff) before sending
the kill(-1,9). It also doesn't kill itself. The signal 15 gives
the daemons time to close the connections and exit. If they are not
finished by the time the signal 9 occurs, then they are forced out, and the
connections left open.
The open connections get closed when a error packet is sent back from
the rebooted system after the remote host sends a retry.
