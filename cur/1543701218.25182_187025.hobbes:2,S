hm, nice.  It does the same thing for /sys/block/md0/queue/nr-requests.
With CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK enabled we go BUG in __wake_up():
Program received signal SIGTRAP, Trace/breakpoint trap.

Where queue_requests_store() does wake_up(&rl->wait[READ]);
It looks like nobody has called blk_init_queue() for this queue and the
waitqueue head is uninitialised.
No md was in use on this machine: it was simply enabled in kernel config.
