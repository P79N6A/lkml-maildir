i've released the -S4 VP patch:
   
http://redhat.com/~mingo/voluntary-preempt/voluntary-preempt-2.6.9-rc2-mm2-S4
-S4 fixes a softirq latency processing bug introduced in -S3. The
symptoms of this bug can be erratic mouse/keyboard behavior, higher
networking latencies, and similar things. (If CONFIG_PREEMPT is disabled
then another effect of this bug can lead to crashes.)
-S4 is also a merge to 2.6.9-rc2-mm2.
To get a 2.6.9-rc2-mm2-VP-S4 kernel, the patching order is:
