Yep. Traditional microkernel.

Partly right. Hurd is _much_ older than Linux, and didn't start from
scratch (Mach was around, and worked). Yet I remember hearing "any day now"
for Hurd from 86 or 87... and as of now, AFAIU even the people hacking on
Hurd prefer Linux (because Linux does work, Hurd doesn't).

Tough luck. An upgrade of the core will _always_ mean rebooting. Plus you
can replace modules in Linux without a reboot.

Me neither. But that is not exactly Linux' fault, binary drivers are quite
strongly discouraged.

By far.

It is still vaporware, some 20 years later.
