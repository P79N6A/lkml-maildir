Hi,
    I assume you are using bios NJ or older with your BP6?  Abit's beta QQ
bios fixes the problem with USB under Win2k when using MPS 1.4.  You can
find the beta QQ bios on ABit's ftp site(ftp.abit.com.tw).  As far as 
the gain/loss between 1.1 and 1.4, the only difference I've seen is that
1.4 will assign interrupts above 15, ie. uhci gets assigned irq19.
At this point, on my machine using the QQ bios, I get USB working properly
with the following os'es:
- Win98 SE
- Win2k Build 2195
- Linux kernel 2.2.14 + usb backport patch
- Linux kernel 2.3.19 and below
- Linux kernel 2.3.44pre9
