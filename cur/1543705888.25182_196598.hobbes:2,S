This is where my memory gets a little hazy, its been a few months.
This would have been a 2.4 kernel (probably around 2.4.21)
on an Altix, the filesystem was XFS. So no highmem, but definitely
not your standard kernel.
I never had time to dig into it too much, but I always thought that
on machines with large amounts of memory it was too easy for the
inode and dcache pools to get very large at the expense of the
regular memory zones. While there were pages available, the dcache
and inode zones could just keep on growing. If you run a big
enough find you get lots of memory into the dcache zone and
have a hard time getting it out again.
And it was try_to_free_pages I was referring to.
It does look like 2.6 does better, but I don't have quite the
amount of memory on my laptop....
