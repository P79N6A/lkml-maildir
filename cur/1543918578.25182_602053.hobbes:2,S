Ok every time something says anything not 100% positive about SLUB you
come back with "but it's fixed in the next patch set"... *every time*.
To be honest, to me that sounds that SLUB isn't ready for prime time
yet, or at least not ready to be the only one in town...
The day that the answer is "the kernel.org slub is fixing all the
issues" is when it's ready..
