Ho humm.. I actually kind of expected the statistics to be done in
generic_make_request(), so that we'd have
	.....
		do {
			q = blk_get_queue(bh->b_rdev);
			if (!q) {
				... no such device ..
			}
	+		statistics(q, rw, bh->b_size);
		} while (q->make_request_fn(q, rw, bh)));
	...
and just remove the drive_stat_acct() thing completely.
That way, we'd have a per-queue "this many reads, this many writes".
The /proc code would have to find all the queues, but that shouldn't be
too bad either. At least we wouldn't have the current silly disk_index()
stuff (which is all done in a timing-critical routine).
Then, as we get saner and saner queues, we'll get saner and saner
statistics automatically. The above should already be quite sane for IDE.
No?
