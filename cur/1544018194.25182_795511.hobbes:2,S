upgrading to 2.6.29-rc2-git1 did allow me to use most of the space but
i still can't quite use all of it. maybe this is to be expected.
(note: i'm just trying testing now, everything i used to have on my
old partition fits. i'm just trying to understand what exactly is
'full'. it seems the file system is 'holding something back'
i included a dumo of df, df -i and tune2fs -l /dev/hda2
(and partition that has ext4 is the / partition or /dev/hda2)
