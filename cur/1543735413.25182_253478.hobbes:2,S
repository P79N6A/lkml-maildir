Subject: [2.6.9-rc2-bk] Network-related panic on boot
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/9/17/230

The panic is caused by ifconfig while configuring the loopback
interface.  The backtrace (copied by hand) follows:
EIP is at fib_hash_move+0x88/0x150

ifconfig exited with preempt_count 1
If I snipped anything important I will be happy to supply it.
 From updating a second machine just now I can say for certain
that it was one or more of the following updates in the last
24 hours which is the culprit:
