Subject: How to make mmap'ed kernel buffer non-cacheable

Hi,
  I am working on an audio device driver development on Linux. I have a kernel buffer which I have mapped to user space using mmap call from user space. My problem is that the data which comes to the kernel buffer is getting dropped in user space and I get only 50-60% of the data which is randomly ordered. The user to kernel level buffer address translation code is fine and I suspect this data dropping is occurring coz the kernel buffer is cacheable. Please suggest me some way of making the entire buffer non cacheable. I am stuck on this for quite a while now. 
Regards,
Bhuvan
