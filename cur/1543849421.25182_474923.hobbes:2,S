I seem to remember Andrew saying something like (paraphrased) "In the  
event that your tree doesn't have a continuous history for whatever  
reason, I'll just pull a fresh copy and work from there".  Given that  
he maintains -mm as a quilt patchset and only uses GIT for incoming  
pulls, I would guess that either way is probably OK, although the  
continuous history makes merging and fixing rejects mildly nicer.
