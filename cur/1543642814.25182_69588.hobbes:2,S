There's no guarantee that the CPU behaves deterministically.
Maybe on April 1, 2005 (or after executing a magic sequence of
1000 instructions) it starts ignoring all privilege and permission
bits.  Good luck finding that through mere testing.

Ok, I agree: The RNG is the most natural, and one of the more
devastating places, to put a backdoor.  (There are other ways
of putting a backdoor in a CPU other than scanning to identify
RSA code, though.)
