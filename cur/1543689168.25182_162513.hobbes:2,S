Hello,
I found and fixed a little bug in the "Intel ICH (i8xx), SiS 7012,
NVidia nForce Audio or AMD 768/811x" driver (kernel 2.4.23-pre2) that
occured on my laptop with SiS 7012 onBoard sound and wanted to
contribute it to the official kernel sources.
In the maintainers file that came with the kernel I couldn't find the
maintainer of that particular driver so I'd appreciate if someone lead
me to the correct mailing list so I can post the bug and my patch to the
right place.
I wrote to linux-sound@vger.kernel.org yesterday but got no answer yet.
Best regards,
Mehmet Ceyran
