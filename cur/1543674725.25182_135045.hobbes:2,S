The kernel, as you have been told several times before, follows a push
model, not a pull one.  Just looking after SCSI, I don't have time to go
around asking all the driver writers for updates; likewise Marcelo
really doesn't have the time to do this for everything in the 2.4
kernel.
Every maintained piece of the kernel has a listed maintainer to whom the
bug reports are supposed to go.  The expectation is that these
maintainers will see the bug reports and pro-actively provide fixes
before they become release issues.  The maintainers also do
enhancements, *but* these enhancements should follow the proper release
cycle (i.e. in at the early -pre stage).
Could you please get with the program?  The bug fix vs enhancement issue
hasn't previously mattered that much for 2.5, but I anticipate we'll be
following a similar model when 2.6 is released.
