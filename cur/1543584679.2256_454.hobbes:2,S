Well. You did discover something. When the new root gets mounted
upon startup, all references to the original ramdisk root should
have been gone. It is well known that the original ramdisk-root
remains,  mounted under /initrd if this directory exists. Writes
to (or even destruction of) this file-system, hanging off a mount
point should not have affected the parent mount point or the
parent file-system. However, as you and I have found, it does.
