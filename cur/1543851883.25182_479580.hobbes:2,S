The reason the corgi code does this is quite simple. If you don't turn
off the backlight when unloading the backlight driver, nothing can turn
the backlight off. The backlight is the biggest power consumer on corgi
and would cause some power drain even if for example you then suspend
the device. I never want to end up with those bug reports. I reasoned
that other devices would have a similar set of constraints (all the
existing users at the time did). On such hardware, deinitialising
anything you initialised is the norm and makes sense but the PC/ACPI
world is different.
Setting backlightdevice->props->update_status = NULL before
unregistering is a horrible idea and I don't want to see hacks like that
so yes, lets move it back into the drivers.

Those commits were designed to standardise several behaviours amongst
several drivers and this specific case was added to the core rather than
coding it in each of several drivers. We therefore really need to update
those other drivers too (locomo at the very least).
