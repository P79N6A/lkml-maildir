I also sent an email a few weeks ago and haven't heard back yet.
In my message I asked whether it was feasible for you to look at
FreeBSD's "ataraid(4)" driver to learn the Intel ICHx-R SoftRAID format.
I know FreeBSD understands this format, and dmraid did not when I sent
the email.
The hardware I was looking at is ICH7-R. It only works in compatibility
mode, which only saw one drive for some reason.
Bottom line: 3Ware Escalade are cheap enough not to bother with this
SoftRAID stuff...
