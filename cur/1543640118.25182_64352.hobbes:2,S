I'm getting errors with kernel 2.4.19 when reading a data CD-R burnt 
under Windows (using Adaptec DirectCD).  Kernel 2.2.20 reads the same CD 
with no problems, as does Windows XP.
With kernel 2.4.19, the CD mounts, and ls works, but when I try to copy a 
file from it, the copy is incomplete, and I get a lot of errors like this:
hdc: command error: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hdc: command error: error=0x54
end_request: I/O error, dev 16:00 (hdc), sector 999504
I've tried turning off DMA for the drive (hdparm -d0 /dev/hdc), but this 
has no effect.
I've had no problems reading CD-ROMs (including copies of CD-ROMs on CD-R 
media) under kernel 2.4.19.
Here's the drive information as reported by the kernel when it boots:
hdc: HL-DT-STCD-RW/DVD-ROM GCC-4240N, ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive
hdc: ATAPI 24X DVD-ROM CD-R/RW drive, 2048kB Cache, UDMA(33)
The drive is in a Dell Inspiron 4150 laptop.
