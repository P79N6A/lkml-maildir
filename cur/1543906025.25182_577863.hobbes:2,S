Roman,
Thanks for the testing and the feedback, it's much appreciated! :-) On
what platform did you do your tests, and what .config did you use (and
could you please send me your .config)?
Please also send me the output of this script:
  
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/cfs-scheduler/tools/cfs-debug-info.sh
(if the output is too large send it to me privately, or bzip2 -9 it.)
Could you also please send the source code for the "l.c" and "lt.c" apps
you used for your testing so i can have a look. Thanks!
	Ingo
