A bash-shared-mapping (from ext3 CVS) will quickly knock it over.  It gets
its PageAnon/page->mapping state tangled up.
Must confess that I have trouble getting excited over objrmap.  It introduces
- inconsistency (pte_chains versus vma-list scanning)
- code complexity
- a quadratic search
- nasty, nasty problems with remap_file_pages().  I'd rather not have to
  nobble remap_file_pages() functionality for this reason.
and what do we gain from it all?  The small fork/exec boost isn't very
significant.  What we gain is more lowmem space on
going-away-real-soon-now-we-sincerely-hope highmem boxes.
Ingo-rmap seems a better solution to me.  It would be a fairly large change
though - we'd have to hold the four atomic kmaps across an entire pte page
in copy_page_range(), for example.  But it will then have good locality of
reference between adjacent pages and may well be quicker than pte_chains.
