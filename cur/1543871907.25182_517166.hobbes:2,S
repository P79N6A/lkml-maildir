Whoops, I was thinking of SysRq-p, which you have already tried.

What about earlier kernels?  Does 2.6.19 work any better?
What about non -mm kernels, like 2.6.21-rc2?
I've never heard of a process failing to show up in a SysRq-t listing.  It 
suggests something is wrong with the process management in the kernel you 
were using.  That leads me to think a non -mm kernel might give more 
informative results.
And as long as you're testing, you might as well also turn on 
CONFIG_USB_DEBUG.
