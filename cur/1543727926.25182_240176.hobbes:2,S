I guess I'm missing something here...

At this point, udev (with the chown/chmod patch) would chown your
linked copy (before unlinking the original device node), right?

So this wouldn't work.

The only problem I can think of is a race when a new device appears
with the same major/minor before udev gets a chance to do its stuff,
eg.
1) User closes device
2) I have linked copy (not open)
3) Device unloaded
4) New device appears
5) I open the linked copy
6) Udev chowns/chmods old device node (triggered by 3)) --> too late
