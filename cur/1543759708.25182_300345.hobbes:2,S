Of course; no one's arguing that (things that depend on broken behavior,
corner cases, etc).  In practice, however; an obvious fix is still an
obvious fix.  :)
What I mean is, if there's an unknown (ie, due to hardware behavior,
user input, etc), and it's not adding sanity checking or somehow
ensuring that the data it's dealing with is of a certain form, then it's
not really an obvious fix.
Of course, part of the problem is that "obvious" is subjective.  I know
what *I* consider obvious; someone who works for a hardware company, and
has access to hardware, specifications, and errata would have different
criteria for what they consider obvious.  Here's where that
signed-off-by-5-people thing comes into play.

That's fine; I agree w/ the additional criteria of "it must be a build,
oops, hang, or race fix".

That's fine as well; that's covered by the "it must only fix one thing"
rule, which I also agree w/.  The "no trivial fixes" thing is still
redundant; a) a patch must contain only one fix, and b) a patch may only
fix a build error, oops, hang, or race.
