The consistency check definitely should not take 15 minutes.  It should
be (much) less than 30 seconds.  What is the hardware you're running on?
I'm running on an Athlon 2 GHz (XP 2400+) with 512MB and a 7200RPM IDE
disk, and I can do a complete clone (with full data copy and consistency
check) of the 2.4 tree in 1:40.  That was with cold caches; with the
sfile copies and "checkout:get", a half-gig isn't enough to cache
everything.  The consistency check is about 19 seconds (bk -r check -acv).
If you keep all your trees on one filesystem, you can use "bk clone -l"
to make hard-links for the s. files.  This means you can create a
complete copy of the tree in about 6 MB, in 40 seconds or so.  BK is
very careful to check the links and break them when necessary.  
To save diskspace, you can turn off "checkout:get", like so:

(Or, add a [$USER]checkout:none line if that is easier.)
If the consistency check is problematic, let's fix that problem -- don't
turn it off, it's valuable.  It's found IDE corruption, it's found BK
bugs, it's found users who move s. files around behind BK's back.
