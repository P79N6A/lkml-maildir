Yeah, something you changed?  Oh well, I will just have to learn to put the "()" 
in :)

Uh, why?  Last I knew that was a real function.  Most of the time I just want a 
simple breakpoint.  I surly don't want the register dumps and such that a 
function call causes, not to mention that it may do something else that is not 
friendly.

Yeah, but it will most likely include asm/kgdb.h....

Right, my answer on that is if it reduces the line traffic yes, if not, no. 
Because then it is just bloat.
