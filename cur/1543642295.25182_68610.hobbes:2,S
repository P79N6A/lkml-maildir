Well.. Maybe.
I actually think that you in practice really only have two cases:
 - we only care about full completion. Easily tested for by just looking 
   at bi_size, and leaving the code as it is right now.
 - the code really cares about and uses the incremental information. At 
   which point it will already have "handled" any previous incremental 
   stuff, and the only thing it really cares about is the "new increment".
So I'd suggest making at least the first cut only have the incremental 
information, since the global information already exists through bi_size.
