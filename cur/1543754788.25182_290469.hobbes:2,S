the simple stack exploit works by overflowing a buffer ON THE STACK with
a "dirty payload and then also overwriting the return address to point
back into that buffer.
(all the security guys on this list will now cringe about this over
simplification; yes reality is more complex but lets keep the
explenation simple for Richard) 
pointing back into that buffer needs the address of that buffer. That
buffer is on the stack, which is now randomized.
