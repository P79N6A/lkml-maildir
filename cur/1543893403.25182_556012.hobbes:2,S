Traditionally we've had bad experiences forcing hardware to do something
the BIOS didn't consider. e.g. occasionally the BIOS has good reasons
to not allow it; maybe it knows about some errata or other problem
the kernel doesn't. 
If you do this then don't make it default at least, but only allow
to force it use an option.

I tried something similar some time ago for the IOMMU aperture.
It turned out that some systems put something into the e820 holes
and didn't boot anymore if you put something else in there.
Your resource allocation will just do that.
You might be lucky because your resources are typically
small (IOMMU aperture was 64+MB) or you might not.
These problems are unfortunately very hard to debug; typically
you have to bisect.
