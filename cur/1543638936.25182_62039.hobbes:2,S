I'm not sure we should go this way. My main problem is that it only solves
a single ordering problem - boot time ordering. What about suspend/wakeup?
We have more of these ordering problems and driverfs is supposed to help
with them, so I'd rather first would like to see how much we can fix this
way.
bye, Roman
