   is there any easy way to flush the printk buffers onto disk?
They don't go to disk, they go into the kernel circular message
buffer.  Syslogd writes them to disk, it will only miss them
if the in-kernel buffer wraps around before syslogd can read
what is there.
   or, put another way,
   is there any way to ensure that relatively high volume printk statements
   get cleanly output to logs?
Make the kernel message buffer larger in kernel/printk.c
Later,
