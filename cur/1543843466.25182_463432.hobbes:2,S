Let me make it clear, I am interested in resource management and not in
containers.
IMO, for resource management to work as expected (as is in other OSes),
guarantee is needed. It will be a good idea to have it from start as it
would affect the design of controllers. 
For example, instead of writing two controllers (one to control limit
and another to provide guarantee), controller writers can provide both
in a single controller. (OpenVZ has two parameters, oomguarpages and
vmguarpages whose purpose is to provide some sort of guarantee using the
barrier and/or limit available in BC)
