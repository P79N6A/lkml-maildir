100khz on a stock kernel with real world hardware:

Sorry man. Did you actually read what I wrote ?

Again: clockevents operate on absolute time, so it is simply the fault
of the user, when he decides to do something stupid like:
femto_seconds_t interval;
timer_function()
{
	do_whatever_you_need_to_do();
	set_next_event(interval, RELATIVE);
}
instead of 
yokto_seconds_t interval;
yokto_seconds_t next_event;
timer_function()
{
	do_whatever_you_need_to_do();
	next_event += interval;
	set_next_event(yokto_seconds_to_nsec(next_event), ABSOLUTE);
}
Please read _AND_ understand the clockevents code. Your uber_clockevents
patch is solving PEBKAC.
