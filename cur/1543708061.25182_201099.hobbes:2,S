IMHO it is rather discouraging that:

www.linux-fbdev.org A record not found, try again

 has no halfway up-to-date information about
the state of 2.6 fbdev devlopment. Sure, one can dig through the mailing list
archives, but if a project is looking for developers I would at least expect a
link to
- the current fbdev source tree
- a TODO that lets me see what work is currently been done by others,
  and what work could be contributed by me
(This is just a suggestion, I don't have time to work on fbdev myself.)
