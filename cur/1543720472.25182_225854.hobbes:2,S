I don't see it as a correctness issue, I see it as a performance issue.
Yes, the old ARM chips that can't do unaligned accesses and can't even 
trap on them probably have a number of cases where they literally do the 
wrong thing, and I think most people will say "tough luck, don't do that 
then". 
But get_unaligned() makes sense quite apart from that usage too. Notably, 
many architectures can cheaply do unaligned accesses when they are known 
to be unaligned, but take thousands of cycles to fix up traps. Alpha comes 
to mind, and this was actually what "get_unaligned()" was really designed 
for.

Right now we might as well consider the "get_unaligned()" to be a "quite 
possibly unaligned" as opposed to "this just _might_ be unaligned".
That's the current usage pattern anyway. Nothing really _guarantees_ that 
unaligned accesses are marked with "get_unaligned()", but the unaligned 
fixup is at least supposed to be _rare_.
Put another way: imagine if the unaligned handler did a printk(). That 
shouldn't flood the logs under normal load.
