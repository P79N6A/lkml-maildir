I think that read/write from a char device is going away too.
For this reason I showed the whole picture of the SAS
domain in sysfs _and_ created a binary file attr to
send/receive SMP requests/responses to control
the domain and get attributes ("smp_portal" binary
attr of each expander).
It is completely user space driven and a user space library
is simple to write.
See drivers/scsi/sas/expander_conf.c which is a user
space utility.  For the output see Announcement 3:
http://linux.adaptec.com/sas/Announce_2.txt
 or here:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-scsi&m=112629509318354&w=2
The code which implements it is very tiny, at the bottom
of drivers/scsi/sas/sas_expander.c

You mean the first Adaptec SAS "adp94xx" driver.
BTW, neither the original "adp94xx", nor the subsequent "aic94xx"
Adaptec drivers implmented _any_ ioctls for CSMI/SDI.
