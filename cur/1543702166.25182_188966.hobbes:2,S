Hi all,
Ever since I moved to 2.6.0, I have been experiencing something I'd
like to call scheduling problems while working in X. I have tried
using preemptive mode, and turning it off, but the symptoms are the
same:
whenever there is continuous disk access (e.g. tar, rsync, dd),
X will not respond for a couple of seconds every couple of seconds.
With that I mean that the mouse will freeze as well as all screen
output, and then resume after a couple of seconds.
I wonder if I am the only one with that problem. The machine in
question is a dual AMD 2400+ with 2Gb of RAM and a Maxtor DiamondMax
drive spinning at 7200 RPM. The drive is configured as follows
(hdparm):
 multcount    = 16 (on)
 IO_support   =  1 (32-bit)
 unmaskirq    =  0 (off)
 using_dma    =  1 (on)
 keepsettings =  0 (off)
 readonly     =  0 (off)
 readahead    = 256 (on)
 geometry     = 16383/255/63, sectors = 241254720, start = 0

I would appreciate any pointers to the source of the problem, or
general hints!
