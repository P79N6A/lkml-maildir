Hi Michael.
Rest of email will be dealt with later, I have to rush back to work...

Attached is the .config file produced by "make menuconfig" in
2.1.132ac13 - you will note that the output produced does indeed show
comments for the "not set" options...
I also tried it with the other choice options in that set, and the
comments are there whatever option is selected.

That "unset" line was inserted by Linus, not me - and, as per the
missive he posted to you in the linux-kernel list, it IS necessary, so
it's "make xconfig" that's in the wrong here...

Again, that was Linus' suggestion...I tend to bow down to experts like
him...
Best wishes from Riley.
