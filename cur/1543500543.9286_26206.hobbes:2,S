Ummgh... Ask Linus ;-) Frankly, I'm more interested in preventing the
horrible clutter that may follow from *any* attempt to play with extended
attributes. We already have it with ext2 and that is what I want to clean
up. Should we go for directory/symlink stuff or not is a separate story.

Umm... Yes, it may be a problem. AFAICS Linus proposed to use O_DIRECTORY
to distinguish between those cases, but old applications *will* be a
problem.

It would be still available (use O_DIRECTORY), but old binaries may break.

It definitely *must* be marked as such. Maybe it's a question of the
st_mode we should show for such animals. If they will be marked as
S_IFLINK... maybe it will stop the breakage.

Rather confused it with another thread ;-)
