- as soon as I start X, the machine is gone.
- if I compile the kernel (without X of course) its ok.
the machine is supposed to be for scientific calculations and we run magma 
on it. The test I ran is just a one-liner which creates a matrix of size
20000x20000 with zeros in it. so basically it just allocates 1.6gb of 
memory and writes zeros in it. the SMP kernel with the above memory 
configuration crashes immediately.
I guess I should write a simple C-program using malloc or something to 
reproduce the crash in the simplest possible way, shouldn't I?
