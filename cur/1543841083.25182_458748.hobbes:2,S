Generally, if a reviewer asks a question and the developer answers that
question, this is a sign that a code comment is needed.  Because others are
likely to ask themselves the same question ;)

No, that's OK.  I was pointing out the problem in situations like this:
struct foo {
	u32 a;
	u64 b;
};
{
	struct foo f;
	f.a = 0;
	f.b = 0;
	copy_to_user(p, &f, sizeof(f));
}
which exposes kernel memory.  As you appear to be confident that the
perfmon code can't do this, all is OK.
