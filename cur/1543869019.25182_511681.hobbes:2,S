BIOS+ACPI, actually.  Without ACPI video loaded, the firmware does
everything correctly.  With ACPI video, the firmware does it, then its
changes are clobbered over by ACPI video's.
If ibm-acpi is loaded, a backlight device "ibm" is added.  ibm-acpi's ibm
backlight device can change the display brightness.  It is *not* capable of
turning the backlight on or off, AFAIK.
BTW, some ThinkPads don't have a Radeon, but rather an Intel GM/GMX device.
