These errors are normal (the requested info is meaningless on CD/DVD 
drives).
 From the .config you sent, " CONFIG_IDEDMA_ONLYDISK is not set ", so 
dma being disabled for your CD/DVD drives may be related to them having 
bugs in DMA mode, the kernel IDE subsystem disables DMA or higher dma 
modes with peripherals it knows to be buggy. Please send the output of 
"hdparm -i /dev/<yourdrive>"

IIRC this message is in fact harmless, do you have any other problem 
with the harddrive ?
