Andrew,
Given the churn in patches I think the best approach is to put kgdb
after you have cut a -mm1 so it can go in -mm2 or as a fix or however
you would like to manage it.  The churn should be a whole lot less once
the new kgdb arch support gets merged.
I updated the for_mm branch to be against 2.6.24-rc5-mm1, and it will
merge cleanly.  I can update again once the next mm branch is available.
Thanks,
Jason.
