Ok, sent them privately. Updated to 2.6.23-rc2-rt2 w/ Peter's
suggestion. You'll get two sets the first had some unrefreshed hunks in
the 3/3 patch .
There is one thing I was wondering about in seqlock.h . There was a
class of these macro's like below,
#define PICK_SEQOP_CONST_RET(op, lock)                          \
({                                                              \
        unsigned long __ret;                                    \
                                                                \
        if (TYPE_EQUAL((lock), raw_seqlock_t))                  \
                __ret = op##_raw((const raw_seqlock_t *)(lock));\
        else if (TYPE_EQUAL((lock), seqlock_t))                 \
                __ret = op((seqlock_t *)(lock));                \
        else __ret = __bad_seqlock_type();                      \
                                                                \
        __ret;                                                  \
})
Where the variable is specifically casted to "const raw_seqlock_t *".. I
ended up dropping these all together, and I'm wonder what the adverse
effects of that are .. The casting seems superfluous to me since you
know already that the type are compatible at that point. Any thoughts?
