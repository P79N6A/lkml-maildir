If you could do that, I'd call that information flow control - I wasn't
saying you had to eliminate covert channels.  As you said, we don't deal
with those even in SELinux.  The point is that AA can't even do that,
not only because it has incomplete controls but because it bases its
decisions on unreliable identifiers (paths) that doesn't let it provide
global and persistent protection of the data.

Without a reliable way of identifying the data in a system view, you
can't say anything at all about the data flows.  The labels provide you
with a way of doing that.  The paths are ambiguous, highly mutable, and
often meaningless (particularly for runtime files, temporary files, etc)
from a security pov.
Simple example:  malicious symlink attacks.
