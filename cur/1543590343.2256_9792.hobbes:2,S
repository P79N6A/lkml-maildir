The include error was in kernel/sched.c . Should I rewrite the includes
for this file to include include/asm/irq.h over include/linux/irq.h? I
temporarily bypassed this problem by creating a blank asm/hw_irq.h . 
I also ran into a compile problem in arch/sparc/kernel/sparc_ksyms.c .
The rw semaphores seem to be undeclared. Here are the warnings:
D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux-2.4.4/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2
-fomit-frame-pointer -fno-strict-aliasing -m32 -pipe -mno-fpu
