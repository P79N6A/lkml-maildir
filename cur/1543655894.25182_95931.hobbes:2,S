Hi,
I can't compile 2.5.51 on an EV56 without this. Tested, boots.
There are a bunch of symbols in core_cia.h that break the build if they're
extern inline because they're only defined in the header now. Make them
static inline instead. (Important, since they're #defined to things like
inb)
Comments?
Matt
