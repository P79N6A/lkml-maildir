I ran dbench 48 four times in succession for 2.4.0 and 2.4.1-pre8.
The change in performance appears to be not significant.
This was performed with a Dell 420 dual P-III (733 MHz), with a ST317221A, 
ATA DISK drive and ReiserFS 3.6.25. 
Each test was done under the same conditions, running KDE 2.0, one xterm, 
right after booting.  
2.4.0:
Average    9.07868 MB/sec
Throughput 9.03546 MB/sec (NB=11.2943 MB/sec  90.3546 MBit/sec)
Throughput 8.99614 MB/sec (NB=11.2452 MB/sec  89.9614 MBit/sec)
Throughput 8.87756 MB/sec (NB=11.097 MB/sec  88.7756 MBit/sec)
Throughput 9.40556 MB/sec (NB=11.7569 MB/sec  94.0556 MBit/sec)
2.4.1-pre8:
Average    9.25707 MB/sec
Throughput 8.93444 MB/sec (NB=11.1681 MB/sec  89.3444 MBit/sec)
Throughput 9.43609 MB/sec (NB=11.7951 MB/sec  94.3609 MBit/sec)
Throughput 9.5075 MB/sec (NB=11.8844 MB/sec  95.075 MBit/sec)
Throughput 9.15026 MB/sec (NB=11.4378 MB/sec  91.5026 MBit/sec)
