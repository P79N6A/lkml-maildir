dear stefan,
fortunately for you and me both, it's already been done, and is
a major (functional) research project of the universities of karlsruhe
and southern australia:
	
http://l4linux.org
as i have insufficient time or resources to dedicate to such a project
, i would be both unable to spend sufficient time replicating their work,
but not only that i would definitely not have enough time, resources or
energy to convince the key people that such work undertaken by was a
viable project.
my expertise appears to be, however, in ferretting out such archaic
and esoteric technology, and in advocating it.  okay.  the finding
i am good at.  the advocating i still need lessons in, because i
tend to ROYALLY piss people off.
*beam* :)
