Hi,
No, i haven't changed anything: the same cable, the same modules.
I was compiling new kernels (-pre1, -pre2 ... all patches ) and just 
after boot running pppd to test connection.
2.4.26 and all 2.4.27-preX works fine till -pre6. All after -pre6 
including 2.4.28-pre4 are not working for me...
Hardware: Dell Inspiron 1100 notebook
