(given an arbitrary existing hardware platform)
Note however, that in many cases, it is possible - by system vendors -
to modify / update firmware and BIOS implementations.

4. Disabling SMIs and mucking with BIOS code may void your warranty,
cause your circuit breakers to trip, and could interfere with the
operation of your toaster.

Some SMI implementations involve dedicated, "embedded" auxiliary
processors and associated firmware, 
others simply exist as BIOS-level implementations.
When the effect of SMI execution governs worst-case task-level or IRQ
latencies on a hardware platform, you may indeed be using the wrong
hardware.
Hardware is subject to the market-driven process, admittedly in some
cases costly, cumbersome and difficult for those constrained by existing
installations and supply-side arrangements.
Latency-friendly SMI implementations may be found in some systems, and
not so much in others.
It should be up to the promotional divisions of the particular hardware
suppliers to assess the market pressure, and to report the performance
advantages of their specific systems.
Worst-case cpu-offlining and other execution-inhibiting system-level
latencies should be required as part of RFP by customers of systems
targeted for real-time, low-latency, and HPC applications.
I envision documentation of these specs, in a similar fashion to the
manner in which CPU clock-cycles are documented for specific instruction
executions - for those systems eligible (certified?) for low-latency
operation.
Broader SMP arrays combined with leveling-off CPU speed, cycle
management seems to be moving back to the fore-front on systems
architecture and design.

Enterprise Distros (IMO) bear the responsibility to raise awareness of
these issues, and stand firm to relentlessly call for open specs and
open implementation.
Providing benchmarking tools is definitely an excellent step in that
direction (imo) - thanks.
