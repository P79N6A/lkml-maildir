I experience the same problem on my Sony Vaio FXA32.
It seems to me to be related to the display.
I can sometimes go into standby mode while in text mode and things 
seem fine.
Going into standby while in X cause the system to freeze.
I can go into standby and come right back out immediately and things
come back but there seems to be memory corruption.
