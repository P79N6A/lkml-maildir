At least on my hardware (ASUS A8V, W83627THF superio) problem is that it now 
uses ECP...
Once parport_pc is loaded, it says it found PnPBIOS parport and finds printer
parport: PnPBIOS parport detected.
parport0: PC-style at 0x378 (0x778), irq 7, dma 3 
[PCSPP,TRISTATE,COMPAT,EPP,ECP,DMA]
parport0: Printer, HEWLETT-PACKARD DESKJET 690C
lp0: using parport0 (interrupt-driven).
lp0: ECP mode
unfortunately write to /dev/lp* blocks indefinitely.  SuperIO registers 
inspection reveals that SIO is actually programmed to use DMA 1 and not DMA 3. 
When SuperIO is reprogrammed, data are apparently sent somewhere (as writes to 
/dev/lp no longer blocks), IRQ count is incremented for each block sent, but 
unfortunately printer does not seem to agree that any data arrived.
Actually I believe that ECP mode never worked for me - but in the past 
parport_pc just used SPP or EPP, and everything was happy.  Now 'modprobe 
parport_pc io=0x378' does not work anymore as parallel port hardware is kindly 
disabled by PnPBIOS code :-(  So I have to first enable parport in SuperIO, then 
set parport mode to SPP, PS2, EPP1.7 or EPP1.9 (low three bits of F0 register in 
function 1 must be 100, 000, 001 or 101) and load parport_pc io=0x378 
io_hi=0x778 irq=7 dma=1.  Then ECP mode is not used and printing works...
parport0: PC-style at 0x378, irq 7 [PCSPP,TRISTATE,EPP]
parport0: Printer, HEWLETT-PACKARD DESKJET 690C
lp0: using parport0 (interrupt-driven).
If you are interested, ACPI DSDT is available at 
http://platan.vc.cvut.cz/ftp/private/a8v.acpi.dsdt.
  W83627THF datasheet is 
available from Winbond website...  I do not understand AML sufficiently to tell 
whether problem with DMA is caused by parport or AML interpreter or buggy DSDT. 
  Non-working ECP is either dead hardware or parport problem existing for very long.
