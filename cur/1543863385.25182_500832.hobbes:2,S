Yes.
However it's not that hard. If you're a target (which open-iscsi  
isn't), you know what the command needs. If you're an initiator, you  
just send the unsolicited data (if any), then let the target tell you  
what it needs next.
While it is possible for commands to have multiple phases, all the  
BiDi commands I'm familiar with use the Data-Out phase to send extra  
command data, then use the Data-In phase to get either an extended  
response to the query (such as a search command) or extended status  
(OSD commands). So it's not that bad in reality.
Take care,
Bill
