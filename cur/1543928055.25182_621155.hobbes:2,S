i realized that.  but all you can say is that only amb_init() calls
setup_dev() *currently*.  when you're not looking, someone else might
(for whatever reason) call setup_dev() from elsewhere, and *that* call
might not zero that memory area.
IMHO, the only safe transforms of kmalloc+memset -> kzalloc are those
in which the flow of control is unmistakable and invariant.  splitting
that across a function call seems like a dangerous thing to do.
(except, of course, in the case, where the kzalloc() is added inside
the function -- then all callers are entitled to simplify *their*
code.  but that's different.)
in any event, i just thought i'd point it out.  if you're absolutely
sure there will never be another call to setup_dev() from somewhere
else, then, yes, it's safe.
