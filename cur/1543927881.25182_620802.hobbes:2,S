huh?
I believe that the OLPC XO1 does not run in ACPI mode
and thus does not use the ACPI EC driver to talk to
the EC on their board.
Presumably they use some native embedded controller driver to
talk to their platform specific embedded controller.
I don't know why they call their interrupt an SCI.
Per above, it can't be an ACPI SCI.  Presumably they
call it that b/c their chipset documentation calls it
that too, on the (invalid) assumption that an ACPI-enabled
OS and firmware would be running on the hardware.
Please let me know if I'm wrong.
