Absolutely.
Patents are bad, but I think peoples "charge the red flag" reactions to
them are also bad.
I think it was Alan who just suggested to Andrea that he'd ask for an
explicit piece of paper _saying_ it was ok, instead of paniccing.
I don't much like patents, but we're forced to live with them. I suspect
the best thing we can do is to use them as well as we can. Which is why I
don't personally think it's a problem that RedHat, FSMlabs etc get
patents.
Can those patents result in trouble? Sure as hell. But let's put it this
way: I'm a _lot_ happier about a RedHat/FSMlabs patent that gets licensed
to GPL users than I am about a patent by somebody who would want to screw
with the GPL.
