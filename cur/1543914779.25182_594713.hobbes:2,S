What happens when you just have ONE disk connected to the motherboard
controller, and the rest connected to PCI controllers?  Does it crap
out then?  You've just such a nice repeatable problem across
motherboards that it's a shame to waste this debugging time.
I'm wondering if it's a PCI bus issue somehow, and that the load on
the motherboard controller isn't supportable when you have a bunch of
disks on PCI controllers as well.  Shot in the dark...
Thanks for all your hard work on this, I know how frustrating it is to
not have a stable system!
