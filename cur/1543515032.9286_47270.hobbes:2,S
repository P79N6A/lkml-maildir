Ahhh.  More than likely, when you had plug and play turned off, there was an
ISA device using an IRQ that was NOT reserved in the BIOS, and this IRQ was
getting dual allocated to the eepro at the same time.
Take a look in the BIOS for a section for reserving IRQs for ISA devices,
and make sure that any device that is on the ISA bus has its IRQ listed
there as reserved.  
Once you turned on PnP, the BIOS automagically reserved the ISA IRQs so that
they didn't conflict with the PCI devices.
Of course, that's just my opinion, I could be wrong.
