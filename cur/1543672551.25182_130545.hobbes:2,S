Hello all,
   I have a mainboard called WAFER-5823 and I did not manage to get it
running well
with 2.4.20 kernel. In fact the board was running well with an older kernel
2.4.10-4GB
at least the messages from /var/log/messages said so.
Now I have this message inside /var/log/messages
      IRQ routing conflict for 00:13.0, have irq 15, want irq 11
With the old kernel I did not have this problem.
I will output the messages that I get with 2.4.10-4GB and also the messages
that I
get with 2.4.20. I do not know what am I doing wrong.
In fact I followed a discution on this list regarding this kind of board
and I understood that there are problems with the routing mechanism but I
did
not understood how to solve it.
Here are the messages
----- 2.4.10-4GB -------
