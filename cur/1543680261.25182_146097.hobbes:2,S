This appears to be working as advertised, thanks! 
IMO it doesn't seem that evil to deliver events per-fd rather than
per-file, this is similar to the semantic you get from select() on
fd's sharing an object. To be surprised someone would have to have
coded to the (previous) sharing visible nature of epoll and be expecting 
the EEXIST back when sharing was in play.
