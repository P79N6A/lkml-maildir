Yep, this is a known issue, with the x86_64 SMP.  The timestamp counter
does not run in sync with each cpu, so the timing gets all screwed up.
If you want to fix this, boot with the command line option idle=poll.
But, unfortunately, this means that the cpu will waste energy even when
it's not doing anything.
I'm looking into ways to fix this for my main machine which is also a
x86_64 SMP.
