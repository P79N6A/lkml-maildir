PC systems have serial at 0x3f8/0x2f8 (lpc bus), almost always PS/2 port
on the mainboard. Timers, interrupt controllers.

As I understand it both Windows XP and Linux x86 still require some of
these ports. There is also a range of ports that are needed _before_ the
PCI bus can be used in order to bootstrap the system, configure ram
timings etc and in some cases adjust the caches.

Whats the _economic_ incentive to do so ? There basically isnt one.
