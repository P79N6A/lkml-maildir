JMPed to ((long)NULL)+1 or something then :) the fact remains that it's
not somewhere that even a memory error would make us likely to jump to.

Different boots. I upgraded, the first boot crashed within five minutes
with weird SCSI errors, so I rebooted again and this happened six hours
later.
I'm willing to write off the SCSI errors to the shock effect of having
just been powered down for the first time in a year (the shutdown
scripts didn't quite work and the reset button is disconnected).

No obvious sign of it:
  9:34pm  up 1 day 22:30,  14 users,  load average: 0.09, 0.12, 0.16
(it is of course waiting until I am hundreds of miles away. *Then* it'll
crash.)
