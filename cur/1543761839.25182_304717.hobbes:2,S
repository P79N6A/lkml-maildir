Putting it into kernel because users want it is... not a good
reason. You should put it there if it is right thing to do. I believe
you should address those endianness issues and drop V1 support. If
breaking 4GB limit does not involve on-disk format change, it may be
okay to merge. After code is merged, doing format changes will be
hard...
