Welcome to the wonderful world of code duplication. And don't forget
the "simplified" TCP/IP stack for network dumps. Uh, USB-attached
storage, anyone ? :-)
Special-case dump drivers make perfect sense in isolated cases (e.g.
narrowly specified boxes) or as a band-aid solution.
But for a general solution, it seems more appropriate to me to solve
the problem of moving the kernel data from the damaged system to an
intact system only once, e.g. using the MCORE approach, than over
and over again for all possible types of hardware and attachment
methods.
The only inherent weakness I see in MCORE is the need to reliably
reset a device, either to the point where it is operational (if
used in the process of dumping), or at least to the point where it
doesn't get in the way (if not used for the dump, e.g. video, HID,
etc.).
But this should still be significantly easier than introducing
"dumb" versions for all drivers. Besides, having a way for cleanly
shutting down or resetting devices is desirable in other contexts,
too (e.g. kexec).
