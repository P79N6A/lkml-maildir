There is really no difference between the two choices, though!
And from what you're writing, I would say that failing to provide a
wrapper script to set up LD_LIBRARY_PATH is unacceptable (but
unfortunately far too typical for most commercial Unix packages; it
seems I always end up writing wrapper scripts to invoke them
correctly.)
 Of course, the best thing would be for them to provide source. In
