I can run 2.3.34 w/ no problems.  No modifications, other than selecting
"Athlon", required, although I do always select "Enable MTRR Support".

Hi,

When deleting the -march=i686 option in arch/i386/Makefile
for K7, all compiles well.
But, after reboot my system freezes to death after showing 
the message "Uncompressing kernel". Hm?!?
What are the correct options for the AMD Athlon? -mpentiumpro
-march=pentiumpro -DCPU=686 or is the better choice -march=i686?
Did anyone compile the 2.3.3x kernel for Athlon before?
SuSE 6.3, egcs-2.91.66, Gigabyte, AMD Athlon 500
