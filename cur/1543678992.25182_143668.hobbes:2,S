Is there any trick to force enabling ALPS support? I'm using a NEC
Chrom@ laptop with an ALPS GlidePoint touchpad, 2.5.73-mm1 and your
patch, but I can't seem to get the enhanced functionality of my
touchpad, like using the edges of the touchpad to simulate the wheel or
else. It seems to behave like a normal PS/2 mouse.
Also, on dmesg, I can't see any reference to an ALPS input device being
detected. Any ideas?
Thanks!
