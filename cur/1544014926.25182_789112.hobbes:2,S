Yes please review!  If people feels it needs a couple more months in
linux-next with more in-depth review then I'll live with that.  I'll
fix anything more that comes up, because I'm desperate to get it
mainlined.  I've lived the last couple of years with constant
moaning from people that I've not mainlined it, and I took
the last six months off work to work on it full time to get
it into shape to mainline.
Hopefully now it's at least in sufficient shape to go into
Linux-next I can get another job, and get some income which
will be nice.

I'll be very happy for a merge now, but of course it's not up to me :-(
