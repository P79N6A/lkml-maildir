There was quite a bit of communication on tuning parameters. Guess we got 
more confusion there and multiple configurations settings that I wanted to 
be tested separately were merged. Setting slub_min_order to more than zero 
can certainly be detrimental to performance since higher order page 
allocations can cause cacheline bouncing on zone locks.
Which patches? 20070922 refers to a pull on the slab git tree on the 
performance branch?

Please do. Add the kernel .configs please. Is there any slab queue tuning 
going on on boot with the SLAB configuration?
Include any tuning that was done to the kernel please.

If it was a git pull then the pass through was included and never taken 
out.

Sure we can do that.

Well we got our own performance test department here at SGI. If we get 
them involved then we can add another 3 months until we get the test 
results confirmed ;-). Seems that this is a small configuration. Why
does it take that long? And the experts knew SLAB and not SLUB right?
Lets look at all the data that you got and then see if this is enough to 
figure out what is wrong.
