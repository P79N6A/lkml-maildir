In the CONFIG_MODULES=n case the __exit section is discarded so yes they
can reference anything without causing breakage.
But that said this is by no means a logical thing to allow from the principle
of minimum suprise.

So modpost should not have this knowledge. A better approach is either to fix
the relations or drom the __init/__exit marker for a few sections.
The __init/__exit parts are mainly of benefit in two cases:
1) When someone has a lot of built-in drivers
2) In the embedded world with scarce memory
As for 1) this is a non-typical case not worth optimizing too much against.
As for 2) this is where the biggest benefit are.
Considering this alsa drivers are likely not typical embedded so here dropping a few
__init/__exit markings should be safe.
But it also depends on what other code is invoked from these functions.
