You appear to be using a third party in-kernel screen reader, that
causes printk() to call into a sleeping function which is illegal.
If the only symptom is the warnings this could safely be ignored.  The
real solution is to fix your screen reader.
(When reporting bugs on LKML, please be sure to mention any third party
kernel drivers you are using)
