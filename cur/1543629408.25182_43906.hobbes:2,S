Don't mix fbgen with fbcon-accel. The new gen_* stuff in fbgen.c is meant
to replace the old fbgen_* stuff. That is why the below doesn't work.

Most likely that is also broken. I haven't thought about it since I plan
to make all the old fbgen_* functions go away.

Correct. That is why I require info->fix to be updated when set_par is
called.
