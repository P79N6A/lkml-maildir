After taking the 30 minute tour of the 2.6.0 dcache code, one thing that seems
possible is shrink_dcache_memory() is causing you the problem. It is doing some
manipulation of the nr_unused value to prevent all unused dcache entries from
being removed and thereby blowing away all recently used entries as well as the
ones that are really stale.
As it stands, it will maintain as many unused entries as there are used entries.
If this low memory system las a large, stable, number of inuse dentry objects,
the unused entries will match it thereby holding double the memory and possibly
causing the problem you see.
here are the lines I mean:
	nr_unused = dentry_stat.nr_unused;
	nr_used = dentry_stat.nr_dentry - nr_unused;
	if (nr_unused < nr_used * unused_ratio)
		return 0;
	return nr_unused - nr_used * unused_ratio;  /* unused_ratio = 1 at the top of
the fn */
Check on your system, /proc/sys/fs/dentry-state, first two values appear to be
nr_dentry and nr_unused. Plug those values into the above code and if you get
something around zero, that's why the memory is stuck.
A couple of solutions come to mind. The one I like best would be to adjust the
above code to make it conscious of the total memory in the system and keep
nr_unused to a reasonable percentage. Another is to allow unused_ratio to be
less than 1, Possibly some/proc entry to lower it (.5, .25, whatever), or to
avoid the float, provide another  parameter to do an integer divisor for
unused_ratio. Something like:
	nr_unused - nr_used * unused_ratio / ratio_fraction
If that's not why the memory is stuck, then it's something deeper in the reclaim
code. Either way, I'd be curious to know what you find. Depending on what your
system shows, I could provide a patch to try some things out.
