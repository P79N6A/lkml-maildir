Okay.. here is the path its taking according to my debug ..
Remember, the issue is: after the buffer is cleaned - they are
still (left) attached to the page (since a page can have 4
buffer heads and we partially truncated the page). After
we clean up the buffers any subsequent call to set_page_dirty()
would end up marking *all* the buffers dirty. If ll_rw_block()
happens after this, we will run into the assert. If no 
set_page_dirty() happens before ll_rw_block() happens, things
would be fine - as the buffer won't be dirty and be skipped.
journal_unmap_buffer() 
{
.....
	        } else {
                /* Good, the buffer belongs to the running transaction.
                 * We are writing our own transaction's data, not any
                 * previous one's, so it is safe to throw it away
                 * (remember that we expect the filesystem to have set
                 * i_size already for this truncate so recovery will not
                 * expose the disk blocks we are discarding here.) */
                J_ASSERT_JH(jh, transaction == journal-
>j_running_transaction);
                may_free = __dispose_buffer(jh, transaction);
        }
zap_buffer:
        journal_put_journal_head(jh);
zap_buffer_no_jh:
        spin_unlock(&journal->j_list_lock);
        jbd_unlock_bh_state(bh);
        spin_unlock(&journal->j_state_lock);
zap_buffer_unlocked:
        clear_buffer_dirty(bh);
        J_ASSERT_BH(bh, !buffer_jbddirty(bh));
        clear_buffer_mapped(bh);
        clear_buffer_req(bh);
        clear_buffer_new(bh);
        bh->b_bdev = NULL;
        return may_free;
}
