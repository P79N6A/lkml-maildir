Also, a re-reminder:
At some convenient point, I'm going to move libata core and drivers to 
new directory drivers/ata.
The other noticeable change coming down the pipe is iomap support, which 
will kill those annoying warnings you see on every build (in addition to 
shrinking the driver a bit).
Speak up now if there are complaints...
