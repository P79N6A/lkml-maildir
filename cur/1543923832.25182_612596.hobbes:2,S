Ah, we actually need slabs below the watermarks. Its just that once I
allocated those slabs using __GFP_MEMALLOC/PF_MEMALLOC I don't want
allocation contexts that do not have rights to those pages to walk off
with objects.
So, this generic reserve framework still uses the slab allocator to
provide certain kind of objects (kmalloc, kmem_cache_alloc), it just
separates those that are and are not entitled to the reserves.
