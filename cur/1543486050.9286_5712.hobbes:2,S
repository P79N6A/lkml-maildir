Subject: kernel 2.2.x; no keyboard echo on boot

machine: HP Omnibook 800ct
kernel:  2.2.2-pre4
When I boot any 2.2 kernel everything appears to be fine, except that
keyboard input is
not echoed back to the console.  If I suspend and then resume the laptop
the problem is
"fixed".  Very strange.  I've tried kernels with and without APM support
to no avail.
This was not a problem in 2.1.120.
I'm about to start digging through the code and was looking for any
pointers.
thanx,
mike
