A peek at the relevant doc on www.x86.org reveals that while triple
fault is a quick way to return to real mode on a 286, it isn't so
reliable on a 386..

I wrote that code originally.. and I can confirm that (on my mb) in DOS
doing the out instruction rebooted, in Linux it did not.  I've no idea
why.  To be annoying, doing the out instruction followed by the
jump-to-bios code locked up the machine.
It was a 486 mb, I don't remember which one.
