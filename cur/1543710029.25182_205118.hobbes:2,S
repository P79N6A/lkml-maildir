Subject: [RESEND][PATCH] Fix PCI<->OF matching on G5 AGP bus
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

(I noticed more recent patches got in while this one didn't, just
re-sending this one in case it went unnoticed :)
----
Strangely, I though I fixed that a long time ago, but it was still
broken in the current tree... So drivers like radeonfb fail to
find the OF device matching a given PCI device on the G5 AGP bus
because of some bus renumbering tricks. This patch fixes the
problem by fixing the bus numbers in the OF node. This corrects
radeonfb and other drivers looking for EDID / PLL datas in the
OF node.
