It's not obvious to me what problems might arise, but the Xen set_pte 
operations do currently rely on preemption being inhibited.  At worst I 
can add preempt_disable/enable calls to them.

If a thread goes from processor A -> B -> A, where A is first preempted 
between a pagetable update and a tlb flush, then the second time the 
thread runs on A may run with a stale tlb (if in the meantime A has 
either been idle or only running kernel threads).
