just to summarise, the top level filesystem requires the following
(additional) functionality:
1. persistent representation of a whiteout node.
2. persistently mark a directory non-transparent.
3. return list of whiteouts in a directory.
4. create a named whiteout.
5. remove a named whiteout.
all apart from #1 must also be accessible via system call
interfaces.
underlying filesystems require no modifications.
user-level changes are:
1. change opendir et al. to deal with whiteouts.
2. change file-tree walker to deal with whiteouts.
3. add options to rm, ls and find to handle whiteouts.
4. teach fsck about specific storage implementation of whiteouts.
5. provide backup/recovery hooks.
note that the bsd implementation provides backup/recovery
using dump/restore.  dump/restore correctly handle whiteout
nodes.  tar, pax etc. have no knowledge of whiteouts.
