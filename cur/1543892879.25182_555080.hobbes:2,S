Let's just say that I've been very busy lately...  (Getting some paid time
to work on man-pages helps a lot!)  One reason that releases get split up
is that for major edits (especially for formatting as opposed to content),
I am trying to separate the edits into separate releases to ease the life
of some downstream maintainers and translators.  From the MAINTAINING file
in the tarball:

    next maintainer: some tips on how to maintain the Linux manual

    Release Philosophy
    ==================
    If you make sweeping *formatting* changes on a large number of
    pages, separate them out into their own release that contains
    minimal *content* changes.  This makes it easier for the people
    that want to verify content changes independently of the change
    log.  Yes, some people actually diff each release to see what
    changed; for example, downstream maintainers, and translators of
    the man pages (such as the dedicated Alain Portal, in recent
    times) sometimes like to do this.

The latest is, well, the latest.  (Take a look at Changes and Changes.old
in each release.)  Today, you want 2.54.  In a few days, you're likely to
want 2.55 ;-).
Best regards,
Michael
