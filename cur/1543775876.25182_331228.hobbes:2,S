Oh gee.  Every operating system does threads differently.  Mozilla has
an abstraction layer called nspr that allows them to handle threads
portably.  glib/gtk has their own threads abstraction.  On Windows, nspr
will use the Windows method for handling threads.  On Linux, it will use
the Linux way.  On systems that don't support threads, it can usually
emulate it using timers.
It's the exact same thing with the userspace VFS.  If GNOME needs to
handle extended attributes, it can use one mechanism under one operating
system, or emulate it using some ugly hack on operating systems that
don't support extended attributes.
Isn't that the whole point of having a VFS?
