Hello All,
  When today I checked the server logs with logwatch I found under kernel 
section a very long messages about the kernel .
  I am usuall checking the logs daily,but I didn;t see the kernel sction so 
long before.
 In that I found warning about kernel error!!
WARNING:  Kernel Errors Present
   hda: drive_cmd: error=0x04 { DriveStat...:  1Time(s)
   hda: drive_cmd: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }...:  1Time(s)
What is this error?
Dose this indicate error on hda?
Should I replace hda?OR it's different from all these?
Please help thank you...
