Power off is also a sync point 8).  But you want it to happen in
bounded time: consider a daemon which opens a device every minute and
never exits.
Nigel's "traverse the run queue and mark the preempted" solution is
actually pretty nice, and cheap.  Since the runqueue lock is grabbed,
it doesn't require icky atomic ops, either.
Despite Nigel's initial belief that this technique is fragile, I
believe it will become an increasingly fundamental method in the
kernel, so (with documentation) it will become widely understood, as
it offers scalability and efficiency.
Rusty.
