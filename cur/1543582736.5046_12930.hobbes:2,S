Good morning,
I did a comparison between 2.4 and 2.2.18 (+ Andrea's patches), using the
respective latest SuSE kernels, but the results should apply to the versions
in general.
Situation: SAP R/3 + SAP DB + benchmark driver running on a single node 4 CPU
SMP machine, tuned down to 1GB of RAM.
Running the SAP benchmark with 75 users on 2.2 yields for the first benchmark
run:
- 7018ms average response time
- 2967s CPU time in 1136s elapsed time
- ~500MB swap allocated
- ~1500 pages paged in/s, 268 pages/out/s on average
Running the same benchmark on 2.4:
- ~700ms average response time
- 1884s CPU time in 669s elapsed time
- ~500MB swap allocated
- ~50 pages paged in, ~212 pages paged out per second on average
Running the same benchmark the second time on both machines to get them warmed
up, 2.2 stays in approximately the same range, while 2.4 gets even _better_,
dropping down to ~350ms response time and ~20 pages in/out.
This is a rather amazing improvement in swapping performance.
Rik, it's time for you to break it again *g*
