Hmm, my only problem here is that this is nonstandard compared to
expected return values from other security_ authorization hooks.
Could this be switched to
	-ve : deny access (and return the error)
	0: grant access
	+ve: fall back to normal permission checking
Actually that's still nonstandard.  On the whole, LSM only
restricts, does not authorize, with capable() being the notable
exception.  Is there good reason to allow LSMs to fully authorize
in this case?
thanks,
