My first try went in this direction. But at a second look I thought
that the names ANY (255.255.255.255) and NONE (0.0.0.0) are indirect
leading to confusion. The interpretation of the zero addresses in
the DHCPDISCOVER packet is in the kind of 'no address' and not of
'any addressee'. So the meaning and usage of INADDR_ANY and ZERO
may be totally different in this file.
In my opinion it is necessary to distinguish between INADDR_ANY
and the ZERO address which ist requested to be in the DHCPDISCOVER
packet.
