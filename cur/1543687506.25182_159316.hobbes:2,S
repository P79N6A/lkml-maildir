 I meant: how does the translation work if there is only a single onboard
controller that does scanning of the embedded keyboard and presents set #1
of codes directly?  But after a bit of thinking I suppose it does support
translation for an external keyboard (which presents set #2 by default and
a lot of PC software expects set #1) and probably a pass-through mode for
it as well. 
 What the big fault of all these limited implementations is, there is no
reliable way to query what is supported.  If a device does not support
mode switching or a particular mode, it should NAK a command that does it,
or at least report the original mode if queried afterwards.  Another
possibility is to return a different device ID -- IBM chose a single value
of 256 possible for its PS/2 keyboards -- why couldn't the incompatible
others have chosen something different, sigh?...
