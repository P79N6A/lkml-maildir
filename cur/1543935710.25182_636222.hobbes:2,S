Filling holes (delayed allocation) and COW are definitely a problem.
But at least for the loop use case, most non-cow filesystems will want
to preallocate the space for loop file and be done with it.  Sparse
loop definitely has uses, but generally those users are willing to pay
a little performance.
Jens' patch falls back to buffered writes for the hole case and
pretends cow doesn't exist.  It's a good starting point that I hope to
extend with something like the extent_map apis.

The problem with O_DIRECT (or even O_SYNC) loop is that every write
into loop becomes synchronous, and it really changes the performance of
things like filemap_fdatawrite.
If we just hand ownership of the file over to loop entirely and prevent
other openers (perhaps even forcing backups through the loop device),
we get fewer corner cases and much better performance.
