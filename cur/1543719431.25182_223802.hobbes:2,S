Yes, xfs_repair will not replay a log, and if it finds dirty metadata in
the log it wants you to replay it via mount. Having xfs_repair able to
replay the log would be handy, but if mount cannot replay it, then
repair will not either. xfs_repair -L bypasses this check and resets
the log. Following that it does a complete consistancy check and
fixup of metadata - it does a good job in most cases. Note that it
deletes lost+found, and if you had files in there, they would be
disconnected and get put back in lost+found again.
The whole reason for -L was customers who automatically ran xfs_repair
after a crash, and hence threw away anything which was in the log. So
it is more of a stop and think what you are doing option.

You can mount norecovery,ro - but no guarantees that it will stay up
long. See Documentation/filesystems/xfs.txt for a list of xfs mount
options.
