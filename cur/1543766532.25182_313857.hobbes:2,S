Not sure what you mean by "make kexec work nicer" but if it is because
some devices don't work after a kexec I have some objections.
What about the kexec-on-panic?
In the end at least every storage device should work after a
kexec-on-panic or else there might be cases where we cannot get dumps of
what happened. My guess is that having access to the network might come
in handy after a kexec-on-panic as well.
So if this patch is because some devices don't work across kexec I don't
think this is a good idea because the same devices won't work after a
kexec-on-panic.
