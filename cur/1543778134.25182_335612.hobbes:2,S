Subject: [PATCH] 1 Wire drivers illegally overload NETLINK_NFLOG

Hi Dave,
Hi Evgeniy,
the following patch fixes the illegal use of NETLINK_NFLOG by the
1wire drivers.  It assumes that the netlink tap families can now safely
be reclaimed, which is the case according to Dave at netconf'05.
I'm not sure who would be the right person to fix this, but this patch
needs to go into both 2.6.12.x and 2.6.13 trees, since it potentially
causes a security problem by preventing the iptables ULOG
This has been the third new piece of code that reuses NETLINK_NFLOG
within a couple of months.  I would really appreciate if people would
actually ask/apply for a new protocol number instead of just overloading
existing values and thereby causing breakage.  
Thanks,
	Harald

   architectural error that shows how much experimentation was going
   on while IP was being designed."                    -- Paul Vixie
Give the 1-wire driver stack its own netlink protocol number, instead of
overloading NETLINK_NFLOG.
I wonder what I have done to people, that they always overload the
NETLINK_NFLOG protocol number and thereby effectively prevent the packet
filter logging mechanism.  Please don't re-use protocol numbers.
