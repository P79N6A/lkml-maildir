Subject: [ANNOUNCE] UML 2.5.26

After a long, relaxing period of ignoring 2.5, I decided that it was about
to catch up.  So, UML 2.5.26 is available.  It is the same code as the current
UML - 2.4.18-40.
This went through my testing without major problems.  However, it was a quick
merge (I started on Thursday with 2.5.3-pre5 and finished on Monday with 
2.5.25), so there may be lurking problems.
Any problems should be reported to the uml-devel list
(user-mode-linux-user at lists dot sourceforge dot net).
At some point in the near future, I am going to split this up a bit and 
send it to Linus.
The patch is available at
