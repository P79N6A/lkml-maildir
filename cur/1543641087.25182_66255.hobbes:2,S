Subject: [BUG/PATCH] : bug in tty_default_put_char()

	Hi,
	Bug : tty_default_put_char() doesn't check the return value of
tty->driver.write(). However, the later may fail if buffers are full.
	Solution : It's not obvious what should be done. The attached
patch is certainly wrong, but gives you an idea of what the problem
is.
	Long story :
	User weant to do PPP over IrCOMM. "chat" opens ircomm device
in non blocking mode and write char by char. I suspect that it's using
the above call, but can't verify (because it doesn't happen to me). As
IrCOMM has not finished its initialisation (the open was
non-blocking), it refuses the write and returns 0.
	Character dropped, user unhappy, bugs me about it.
	I'll try to workaround that in IrCOMM.
	Regards,
	Jean
