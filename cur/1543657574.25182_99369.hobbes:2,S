I had some timing problems also but Andrew pointed out the following:
Seems that this is because different parts of the kernel are using
different values of HZ (!).
In include/asm-i386/param.h, please add:
#ifdef __KERNEL__
+#include <linux/config.h>
#ifdef CONFIG_1000HZ
Here is a patch for that change:
