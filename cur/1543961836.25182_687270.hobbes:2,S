Sorry for the semi-OT, but this seems to be the easiest way without 
using any @kernel.org address in the To: header:
Since yesterday evening hera (the machine handling emails to @kernel.org) 
seems to no longer accept emails, vger alone has currently over 1300 
emails queued for hera [1] and SMTP locally from hera also doesn't work.
Could some admin look at it?
Thanks in advance
Adrian
