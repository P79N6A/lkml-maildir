Your slab usage seems to be:

Something pretty much stands out.
What the _heck_ is doing 64-byte allocations and leaking them?
Can you figure out what triggers it for you? If nothing obvious comes to 
mind, could you do something really silly like this

	                         csizep->cs_dmacachep : csizep->cs_cachep, flags);
	        }
(totally whitespace-damaged) which should just print out a stack dump 
every four thoudand allocations, which should give a good clue (somebody 
else might also be allocating those 64-byte things, but _likely_ we'll see 
at least one of the leakers.. Maybe.)
