Hi al...
I have a little question. Let's suppose you have this:
int (*pf)(data *);
int f(data*);
so you can:
pf = f;
pf(data).
Fine. But what happens if:
void (*pf)(data *);
int f(data*);
pf = f; // gcc happily swallows, gcc-3.2 gives a warning.
pf(data).
??
In C calling convention, the callee kills the stack so nothing should
happen... or it should ?
The (in)famous graphics driver all you know is doing this with the
copy_info op for gart...
TIA
