In fact, I wonder if we shouldn't just get rid of the GFP_WAIT conditional
in __get_free_pages(), and make all that unconditional, so that we track
low memory situations correctly even for atomic network traffic -
something that obviously is a GoodThing(tm) to do. Then we could just make
sure that try_to_free_pages() returns immediately for anything that
doesn't have GFP_WAIT set, and have all the kswapd logic there.
That would even get rid of a test in the common path.
