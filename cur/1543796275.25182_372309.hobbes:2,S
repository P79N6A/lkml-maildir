You're not stuck with anything onerous in this case. Namely,
If you have "enum XXX" and you want to go to "enum YYY", then...
	sed 's/enum XXX/enum YYY/g'
If you have "struct XXX" and you want to go to "struct YYY", then...
	sed 's/struct XXX/struct YYY/g'
If you have "enum XXX" and you want to go to "struct YYY", then...
This is a big change, and should be done with care anyway. If struct YYY
happens to be large, then suddenly you can get all sorts of nifty stack
overflows.
In general, code that does not typedef enums and structs unless
absolutely necessary is easier to work with for these reasons:
1) The type of the variable is very obvious from its 'name', without the
uglyness that is Hungarian notation.
2) You don't need to include definition (such as from a header file)
just to declare a pointer to the type. Cuts down on #include clutter.
3) The enum namespace is separate from the struct namespace, which is
separate from other namespaces. Less naming collisions.
YMMV; not an invitation to start a coding style religious war
