	I understand your argument that modutils shouldn't be responsible
for documenting all the other modules.  On the other hand, if a reasonably
complete one exists that might provide the example an end user needs,
wouldn't it make sense to include it in the modutils package for
reference?
	Adam Richter sent out a proposed universal conf.modules file in
1998 (see "Announce+RFC: universal base /etc/conf.modules file", sent Fri,
24 Apr 1998 18:58:59 -0700, attached; there may have been later postings
with updated versions).  Adam - are you still maintaining that?
	Cheers,
	- Bill

Windows 2000 installed without a hitch, but the process takes so long
that InfoWorld Senior Analyst Maggie Biggs and I are debating over the
best 10 things you can do while you wait. One of her thoughts is to run
a marathon. And not finish first.
I'll have to fall back on one of my favorites: spit shining the Empire
State Building.

Subject: Announce+RFC: universal base /etc/conf.modules file
	Below, I have attached a basic /etc/conf.modules that I
believe covers every request_module() call that the kernel generates
that does not depend on the user's hardware configuration.  This will
make it easier for people to modularize almost everything and make
maximal use of kmod.
	Also, I would appreciate corrections to any errors or omissions
contained in this file.  I intend to submit it for distribution with
the kernel, although first I think I want to suggest some syntax
and feature changes for the modprobe configuration file format.
(I want to be able to have multiple configuration files that are
read together, and allow these multiple files to append to an alias
rather than replace it, so I could have several files that add to
the definition of "scsi_hostadapter", for example.)
	Anyhow, enjoy and please send me any fixes.
