If some things can use the kobject path, we can use it in the argument
field.  I am cool with that - that is exactly what I want, in fact.  But
what we use as the naming convention needs to be something we can use
uniformly.  Unfortunately not everything has a kobject backing it, and
we cannot change that.

The signal name would be different.

I like your macro-izing idea and the notion of standardizing.  Someone
else brought up a good example: we want _all_ disk drivers to emit the
exact same signal for e.g. "disk full" so user-space can react to it.
It needs to be consistent.  At least for driver error logging, we
definitely want standards and macro-izing.  The translation point is
another good reason for it.
