It's easy to link the PNP devices with the ACPI devices with the ACPIPNP
driver. But the PNP driver core hasn't similar routines as
'pnp_set_power_state'. Unclear if the PNP drivers support
suspend/resume.

Yep, this is a big problem. According to the comments in the source
file, it's designed for firmware such as ACPI, but some drivers misused
it. A search shows there are many such drivers. Fixing the drivers is a
pain for me.

I will fix it.

That's ok.

Possibly both the physical devices and ACPI devices have a link in sysfs
to pointer partners.
