The dpt_i2o driver (which is a scsi driver) accepts the
SYNCHRONIZE_CACHE scsi command and passes it off to the firmware. The
firmware respects this and flushes all the outstanding (cached)
commands. This is true in all (kernel.org or Adaptec latest) versions.
The only environment, in my memory, that this has been tested is in the
ASR driver in FreeBSD, where this behavior is necessary in support of
cluster checkpointing.
