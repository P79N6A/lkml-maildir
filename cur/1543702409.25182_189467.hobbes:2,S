My point is that the above problem crops up in almost *all* combinations
of automounter daemon with remote filesystem and strong authentication.
In order to correctly mount the remote filesystem, the automounter
itself needs a minimum set of remote privileges (typically it needs to be
able
to browse the remote filesystem).
RFC-2623 describes how to add RPCSEC_GSS to NFSv2/v3. The
workarounds (hacks really) that I refer to above had to be deliberately
added in order to make Sun's automounter work in this environment.
The alternative would have been to have a global "machine" credential
for use by the automounter when browsing /net. Hardly secure...

Certainly. I believe CIFS might also have a similar mechanism.
