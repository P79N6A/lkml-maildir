Before someone else comes saying that they had problems with a Cyrix
processor ( I don't use one myself ;-) ),
wouldn't it be logical to search the problem somewhere else, instead of
blaming it on the cpu, pherhaps we should be blaming it on the support of
the cpu. Linus has already pointed in the direction of the "comma bug",
that would pherhaps be a good clue. He thought there could be some
problems in that fix. So if some people with a (alike) Cyric cpu (having
sometimes some Oopses) could just _try_ and disable the MTRR support
and/or the "comma bug" workaround.
I don't know where this oops occurs, is it pherhaps some signal register
of the cpu that indicated this fault (on which the kernel responded) for
if this is the case, it could just be that the bug lies in the processor's
signal registers. (I don't know the actual name of those things, I just
know that they exist in some form).
