And nobody is alarmed by this?  Surely crashing the kernel by plugging
in a USB device must be considered a MUST-FIX item.  Perhaps I missed
something, but I never saw this mentioned before.

Ugh, I only have about half a dozen or so different types of USB
devices (and even fewer of them are HID devices), so my experience
isn't exactly a statistically valid sample.  Having said that, out of
that 6 or so devices, that particular keyboard is the only one causing
crashes.  However, note that it works (mostly) fine under 2.4 and even
if they keyboard were total crap, it certainly shouldn't crash the
kernel.
