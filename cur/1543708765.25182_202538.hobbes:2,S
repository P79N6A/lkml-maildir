It is the highest index of all the configured disks. Did you read my
previous email?  If disks 1 2 4 and 7 are configured, the
open_data.max_disk will be 7. If the admin thena adds disk 23, the next
time we probe (by calling the HV open interface) the returned max_disk
will be 23.
I do not apologise for braindead interfaces in code I didn't write ...
In this case I just have to use it.
