They've been discussed with RT/scheduler/cpuset folks.
Andrew is definitely in the loop. He just replied and asked for some fixes and
clarifications. He seems to be ok with merging this in general.
The last patch may not be as bad as I originally thought. We'll discuss it some
more with Andrew. I'll also check with Rusty who wrote the stopmachine in the 
first place. It actually seems like an overkill at this point. My impression is 
that it was supposed to be a safety net if some refcounting/locking is not fully 
safe and may not be needed or as critical anymore. 
I'm maybe wrong of course. So I'll find that out :)
Thanx
Max
