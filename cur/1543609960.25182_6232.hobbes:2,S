Actually not.  If you want to save/restore ACLs, you can easily do
something like the following before each backup:
getfacl -R --skip_base > .acl_backup
and if you need to restore ACLs, you to the reverse after a restore:
setacl --restore=.acl_backup
This puts the ACLs into a regular file that any backup system can handle.
The EA/ACL support will _likely_ be put into 2.5, so it will probably
be easier to use this than to always patch to support > 32 groups,
including all of the user tools, etc (which AFAIK is not anywhere on
the radar to go into the stock kernel, especially since it impacts the
fast-path for _every_ process either by making the tast struct bigger,
or requiring an extra dereference to get at a dynamically-allocated
group list).
Cheers, Andreas
