It could report itself as an IDE removable device of some sort. That includes
IDE Floppy, IDE Optical.
It can also report itself as a regular hard disk but must set bit 7
of the config byte so that it is reporting itself removable. If that bit
is not set the OS is permitted to assume the device never changes media
and it can cache it indefinitely - which Linux does.

Config={ Fixed Removeable }
is what it should report. Config bit 7.

The maixpio value appears broken as does cursects.
