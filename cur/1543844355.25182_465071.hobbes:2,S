I don't think a shorter cycle is necessarily better, but I think we could 
try having a more "directed" cycle, and perhaps merge certain specific 
things rather than everything.
That would possibly _cause_ a shorter cycle, if only because the problems 
are hopefully more focused from the fact that we merged with a certain 
focus.
Of course, it would likely just frustrate the people who didn't get 
merged, and would need to wait for the next cycle. So it might be a net 
negative, even if we'd bring individual cycles in a bit.

I think that's true. 2.6.18 got delayed partly due to me beign away, but I 
also think that it then got delayed too much afterwards too, just because 
I felt a bit nervous about having been away ;)
So it definitely stretched out too much.
Whether there is a lot we can do about it, I dunno. In many ways, the real 
issue is simply that we have a lot of changes. And people are _never_ as 
interested in the testing part as they were in writing new code..
