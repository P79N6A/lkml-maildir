It allocates a potentially-significant amount of memory per-task, until
that tasks exits (we could release it earlier, but the problem remains) and
it adds yet another global lock in the process exit path.

And it adds complexity and code.
So I think we're still seeking a solution to this.
Options might be:
a) Pin the most-recently-visited task in some manner, so that it is
   still on the global task list when we return.  That's fairly simple to
   do (defer the release_task()) but it affects task lifetime and visibility
   in rare and worrisome ways.
b) Change proc_pid_readdir() so that it walks the pid_hash[] array
   instead of the task list.  Need to do something clever when traversing
   each bucket's list, but I'm not sure what ;) It's the same problem.
   Possibly what we could do here is to permit the task which is walking
   /proc to pin a particular `struct pid': take a ref on it then when we
   next start walking one of the pid_hash[] chains, we _know_ that the
   `struct pid' which we're looking for will still be there.  Even if it
   now refers to a departed process.
c) Nuke the pid_hash[], convert the whole thing to a radix-tree. 
   They're super-simple to traverse.  Not sure what we'd index it by
   though.
I guess b) is best.
