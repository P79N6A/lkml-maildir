Looks good.  The only trouble I can see left is that pte_clear() is
still using set_pte(), which doesn't work right for PAE36.  set_pte()
is setting the high word first, which is fine for installing a new pte,
but if you do that to clear a pte then you have left the old
page-present bit intact while you've removed have of the pte.
pte_clear() needs to clear the words in the other order (just as
pte_get_and_clear correctly does).
Cheers,
 Stephen
