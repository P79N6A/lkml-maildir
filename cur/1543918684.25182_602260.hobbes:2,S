I think that's an improvement in all respects.
However it still does not generally address the deadlock scenario: if
there's a small DMA zone, and fuse manages to put all of those pages
under writeout, then there's trouble.
But it's not really fuse specific.  If it was a normal filesystem that
did that, and it needed a GFP_DMA allocation for writeout, it is in
trouble also, as that allocation would fail (at least no deadlock).
Or is GFP_DMA never used by fs/io writeout paths?
