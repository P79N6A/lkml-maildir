Thanks for the reply.
The reason that I was interested is that this behavior, if implemented
for all fd types, would be useful for a scalable user-space
implementation of POSIX aio.
When you say that it is 'not done for files', does that mean that it is
not done by design, and no plans exist to implement it for files
(perhaps because completion notification is fundamentally different than
readiness notification?), or that the work just has yet to be done?
Thanks.
