Well, I guess that's one word for it...I'll bet $5 Al's got a few others
;-) A better fix is to have private inode dirty lists....

I think so, but there needs to be some testing there.  Note that I managed
to run a heavy stress test (put my machine far, far into swap) for 3 solid
days without hitting this.  When I initially made the dirty_inode kludge, I
could trigger it in ~10 minutes.

sorry, not sure what you mean.  In fsync we do a commit, which might wait
on the current transaction, so kswapd can't go down that code path.
