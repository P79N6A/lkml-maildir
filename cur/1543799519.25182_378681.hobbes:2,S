Note that semaphores on 32-bit PPC are only 16 bytes already, since I
got rid of the sleepers field ages ago.  The fast path is just
atomic_dec/inc, and the slow path needs an atomic op that does
	x = max(x, 0) + inc
atomically and returns the old value of x.  That's easy to do with
lwarx/stwcx (just two more instructions than an atomic inc), and can
also be done quite straightforwardly with cmpxchg.  Alpha, mips, s390
and sparc64 also use this scheme.
In fact I would go so far as to say that I cannot see how it would be
possible to do a mutex any smaller or faster than a counting semaphore
on these architectures.

Paul.
