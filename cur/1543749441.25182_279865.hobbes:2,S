Glad to hear it, I'm just the messenger on that one (I forget which lkml
denizen actually wrote/posted that one).

I'm actually not *that* surprised - my test base consists entirely of one Dell
Latitude C840 laptop with a GeForce4 440 Go card, so there's no SMP issues or
similar, and I don't do heavy 3D or anything unless xscreensaver decides to use
a random OpenGL display hack. Most likely, your hardware and/or CONFIG_* setup
is getting it into code paths that never get hit on my system. And the
might_sleep() is almost certainly on one of those paths.
(For the record, I *did* see a few might_sleep hits on 2.6.10-rc2-mm4-V0.7.31-15,
but they only hit sendmail, gpg, bash, and stuff like that, never an X-based program.)
