Sorry, I was trying to indicate that it was a generic change which was
motivated by Xen support, but you're right it did look like I was saying
it was a Xen only change.
As far as the actual change goes I was assuming that any machine that
has DMI/SMBIOS would easily be new enough to have an E820 which could be
expected to reserve this region. Looks like I was mistaken about how
long E820 had been around and/or how reliably it is used to reserve the
tables.
Anyway, will have to think of another solution.
Ian.
