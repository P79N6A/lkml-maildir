Go back and read the entire thread Dave.  It started with
http://www.lib.uaa.alaska.edu/linux-kernel/archive/2002-Week-04/1235.html
  "Besides problem with segfaulting crc32 (it is initialized after
  net/ipv4/ipconfig.c due to lib/lib.a being a library... I had to
  hardcode lib/crc32.o before --start-group in main Makefile, but it is
  another story)"
http://www.lib.uaa.alaska.edu/linux-kernel/archive/2002-Week-04/1384.html
  "included patch (for 2.5.3) fixes problems with late initialization
  of lib/crc32.o - as it was part of .a library file, it was picked by
  link process AFTER at least one .o file required it - for example
  when ipv4 autoconfiguration file needed it. So crc32's initalization
  function was invoked after ipconfig's one - and it crashed inside of
  ipconfig due to this problem."
Horst was not talking about initcall but his suggestion of using lib.a
for crc32.o had already been proven not to work, because of the
(surprise) initcall problem.  I was merely pointing out to Horst why
lib.a was not working and why other options had to be considered.

Nightmare is more like it.
