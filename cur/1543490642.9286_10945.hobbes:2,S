True. However, in practice, when run on ext2fs, with a reasonably fast cpu
(celeron 300a or more), with any UDMA disk that I've seen, bonnie gives
you the sequential sustainable disk data transfer rates too when run on a
2GB file.
You can see whether the bottleneck is the CPU or the disk by looking at
bonnie's cpu utilization results. The only time I can think of to use
hdparm instead of bonnie is when you're doing block device development and
are testing if your code has any throughput problems
I think hdparm could be much more useful if it would scan the entire disk
and produce the data for a graph of drive speed vs position on the disk.
Cya,
Jelle.
