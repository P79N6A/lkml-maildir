No - quite the opposite. I had 0 in /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory. All
that happened was the compiler processes grabbed all the VM I had,
malloc() started returning zero, things started dying when they couldn't
get the memory they needed.

Ah, we're talking at cross-purposes then. I was meaning "when you can't
allocate any more" - i.e. malloc() starts returning 0, etc. This is a
perfectly "normal" thing to happen, and is what happened to me last night.
Even though I was sitting in front of it at the time, there was nothing I
could have done - I had an open "top" window, and saw my load average pass
the 10 mark, after which the system stopped responding to user input.
Keystrokes were not getting through, so it was just a "sit back and wait"
job. Eventually, everything went pear-shaped, all the processes exited
from lack of memory, and I was able to reload the processes I had lost -
Rik's patch could have made this a lot quicker, though!
IMO, if the kernel suddenly finds it has made promises it can't keep, it
has fscked up - OTOH, it's a bit late to do anything about it :-)
