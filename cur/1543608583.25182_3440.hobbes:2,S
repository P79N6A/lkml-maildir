  If I understand the code well: When ext2 creates new file it will try to
allocate data in the same group where it got inode. If there's no free block
(or better 8 blocks) in the group it will try another one etc (but it will
be probably also full - we will first try to spread file over half of full
groups (in average) before hitting the empty one). But I agree that this way it
will fill the holes with the file and next time it will start in empty
group. Anyway this allocation strategy will IMHO not keep inodes near data...
