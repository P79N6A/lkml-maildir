Well, it is difficult to implement (network bandwidht limiting or i/o
latency for example), but asking for it once a year might make it reality.
OS2 had a lot of these things in their scheduler, but, according to
subjective reports from a lot of people, it didn't seem to work very well
(it slowed downt he scheduler considerably without ever working great).
