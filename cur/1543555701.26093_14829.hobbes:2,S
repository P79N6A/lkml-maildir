[patch elided]
	Thanks for the patch, but I think I'll stick with the ifdefs
for now, for the following reasons.
	1. I think ifdef MODULE is more understandable to the casual observer.
	2. There is often some other condition that I need to combine
	   with (CONFIG_PCI, CONFIG_ISAPNP, CONFIG_ISAPNP_MODULE).
	3. There is often an existing ifdef in the right place that I
	   can just tuck the code into.
	4. I would prefer that this change not have even a file size cost
	   to people who want to build minimal monolithic kernels
	   for applicance applications.
	5. My feeling is that just the few kilobytes of file size cost
	   associated with #4 and knowing that absolutely nothing is
	   added for non-module usage will psychologically make
	   maintainers feel better about it and have even fewer misgivings
	   about integrating it.
	6. We can expect the lines bracketing these table declarations
	   to be changed in the near future as the drivers are changed
	   to use the new PCI and isapnp interfaces or to use the ID
	   tables just to eliminate the old custom data structures that
	   hold the same information.
	Thanks for the patch anyhow, though.  It's a clever idea that
may be useful in other situations.
