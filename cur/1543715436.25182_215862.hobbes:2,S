Do you get lock-ups wihtout the timer_ack/C1halt patch? If yes, this may 
be the cause. I remember someone finding out that Ross' patch made the 
timer actually slower which resulted in stable operation. Maciej found 
out, not connecting the timer at all made it stabke as well. So is there 
a possibility to sync both timers?
According to a recent post, builöding kernel with SMP makes it stable, 
as well, but I haven't tested.
