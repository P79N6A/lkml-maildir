Yes, you are right. As I expected that this isn't the final patch I was a
little bit too lazy. Will do that for the next version.

Ouch! Totally missed that. The measurement should be kind of round-based
instead.

  if (tmp) {
     sb->s_scan_count -= count;
     sb->s_scan_count -= sb->s_scan_count ? min(sb->s_scan_count, count/2) : 0;
     prune_dcache_sb(sb, tmp);
  }
  if (!sb->s_dentry_stat.nr_unused)
     sb->s_scan_count = 0;
In a normal situations, s_scan_count should be zero (add count and subtract it
again).
s_scan_count is increasing when we don't prune anything from that
superblock. If we finally reach the point where the s_scan_count is that high
that we actually prune some dentries, we slowly (count/2) decrease the
s_scan_count level again.
If the superblock doesn't have any unused dentries we reset the s_scan_count to
zero.
So s_scan_count is some kind of badness counter. I hope that this will still
be good enough for you, David.
