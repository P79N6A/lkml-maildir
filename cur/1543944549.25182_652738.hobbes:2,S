Ack. Same for PS3 and m68k (except I don't have the m68k patches in git (yet)).
Two issues with using quilt:
  1. Sometimes a patch still applies after it was integrated upstream,
  2. Sometimes it's a lot of work to fixup the patches after an upstream
     change. I wrote a script to do a tree-way-merge in case of a
     conflict, but I haven't really tested it yet (not suitable big
     conflict has happened since ;-)

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
