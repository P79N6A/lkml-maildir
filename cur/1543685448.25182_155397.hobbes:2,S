Oh good, then you won't have any problem with modifying the kernel to put in a 
printk or two ;-)

According to me, this should not happen, since your cpu usage is well below 
what is supposed to be the cutoff for the realtime slice.  I've only seen one 
report like yours, where SOFTRR isn't working as intended.  On the other 
hand, I've missed a lot of lkml traffice lately, so there could be more.
What kind of system is this?  Is it a laptop with speedstep?

Daniel
