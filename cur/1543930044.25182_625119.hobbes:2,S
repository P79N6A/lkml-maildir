I will look a bit more into the details later; for now I have just a
quick comment on the documentation.

There are some really long sentences in it.

In other words, the FireWire controller can be configured to work as a
bus bridge between FireWire bus and local bus (PCI or PCIe).
And yes, there are security implications.

This is correct for ohci1394, and it's a bug.

firewire-ohci however implements filtered physical DMA.  The only user
of that is the firewire-sbp2 driver which grants SBP-2 targets access
through the physical response unit.  firewire-ohci has at the moment no
option for either unfiltered physical DMA (as needed by firescope at al,
tracked at 
http://wiki.linux1394.org/ToDo
) nor to completely disable
physical DMA.
