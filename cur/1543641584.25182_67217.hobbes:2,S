I am not sure if this is correct.  You can achieve proper locking in
userspace, but I do not think you achieve proper security. 
I assume you are proposing an implementation based on shared memory:
which means that at least some pages of the shared memory must be
writable.  If the processes cooperate and only write to the shared pages
through library routines which use sychronization, things are ok, but a
malicious process could forge messages or perform DOS attacks etc. by
bypassing the mq_*() functions and using write().

The mq_maxmsg and mq_msgsize members of the mq_attr structure required
if O_CREAT is passed to mq_open() ensure that an implementation can
prevent the kernel memory DoS you mention: a malicious application can
only fill up the MQ memory.
