Hi Chris,
Here are some more inputs;
from ps -lwa | grep sync
0 500 10456 751 0 0 1020 324 wait_on_dqu D ? 0:00 sync
where wait_on_dqu = 'c0133151' when using ps -lwan
It does not only takes time, but really Died!
I'v upgraded my fileutils to 4.0 from 3.16 and still the same,
I also reompiled it (synce I'm using glibc2.1 and still the same.
Most often it "freeze" thoe whole gnome interface and keyboard/mouse, only way out is to telnet in and then "shutdown -r -n now", then wait few seconds and then press "reset" or turn off the machine, and sometime "unplug" from the wall (ATX power supply).
Is there any way I can try to trace it so I can give you  more info?
Thanks
Andre
