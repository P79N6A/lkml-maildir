I was thinking that a mailing list that only sent messages informing
people when a new kernel came out would be a good idea... please let me
know if there is one already, or if not if you think having one would be
a good idea...
Linus: and please let me know if you would send an email when releasing
a new kernel maybe with little summary of relevant changes or whatever
you wanted to said list if one was created, thank you
Alan: also if you would possibly do the same for your patches? ;-) ...
quite a few people like those as well
