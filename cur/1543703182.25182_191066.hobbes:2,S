I have an athlon-xp laptop (HP pavilion ze4500) with powernow that
definitely goes into low power mode when the plug is pulled.  The screen
goes dark, and everything slows down.  And, it appears to be some kind
of percentage of current speed, because if I'm in powersave mode (532000
Hz rather than 1795500), then it gets unbearably slow.  However,
bogomips is not updated when I pull the plug.  I've never run for any
length of time with boot-on-power-then-pull-the-plug, because I only do
that to go from one plug to another.  If I'm running without the plug, I
generally booted that way.  I use the k7-powernow module for my
powersaving.
