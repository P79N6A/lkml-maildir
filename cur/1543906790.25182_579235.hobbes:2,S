Since I was just involved in the boot decompressor for another bug, I 
took a look at this.  2.6.22 switches it to be 64-bit code.  VT is very 
picky about what state it can run in.  Not using VT on Intel 64-bit 
hardware cripples performance, running at far below normal speed, and 
taking minutes to decompress the kernel, which is nearly instantaneous 
otherwise.
To get back into VT in this case, not only do we need to load FS and GS, 
we also need to setup an initial LDT and task.  Can you try the attached 
patch and see that it does the right thing?
I've also cc'd the KVM developers, as the same problem will affect them, 
and hopefully the same patch will fix it.
Thanks, Zach
Zach
VT is very picky about when it can enter execution.
Get all segments setup and get LDT and TR into valid state to allow
VT execution under VMware and KVM (untested).
This makes the boot decompression run under VT, which makes it several
orders of magnitude faster on 64-bit Intel hardware.
Before, I was seeing times up to a minute or more to decompress a 1.3MB kernel
on a very fast box.
