Well, they may very well just deal better with PIO modes.

Hmm.. you wrote that cdrdao gives the problem, but cdrecord
doesn't. And in a previous mail you wrote that you also have the
problems when writing audio CDs. Are you sure that you really used DAO
when using cdrecord? All other symptoms look very much like the big
blocksize problem.
