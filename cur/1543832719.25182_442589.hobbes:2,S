I'm not sure how you would like to handle this, but a similar fix needs to 
be made in drivers/acpi/osl.c:acpi_os_wait_semaphore().  If interrupts are 
disabled the timeout argument should be set to 0, so that the routine will 
call down_trylock() instead of down() or schedule_timeout_interruptible().
