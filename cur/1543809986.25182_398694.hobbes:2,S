Well, as I wrote, I am not the original reporter whoms thread you
responded to with your patch. I just thought I could use it to get
better errors messages for my bug reports.
I am using the sata_mv driver, which is beta. That might explain why it
behaves not totally as expected in your eyes. I have no clue anyway :-)
I hope my reports are of any use to Jeff wrt the sata_mv driver.
Thank you for your response.
