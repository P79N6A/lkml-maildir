Hello.
I'm writing some code to read battery status, but am having problems reading
  /proc/acpi/battery/BAT0/info.
If I read that file, I can fill *one* and *only one* buffer before I get
  EOF (read returns 0 bytes read on the next buffer).  This is regardless
  of buffer length--I can use 1 or 3 or 10 bytes.  First read succeeds,
  second read fails.  Errno is 0.
With the *same code*, I can read the entire file without issue.
Any hints as to what's going on here?
Thanks!
Puzzled,
-Joseph
