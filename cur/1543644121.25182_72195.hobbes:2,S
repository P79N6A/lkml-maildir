Could you please explain, why you think I'm ignoring this problem?
(I think I don't, but I want to be sure we talk about the same problem.)

For an alternative solution:

Even your bigref is still overkill. When packets come in, you already have
to take _some_ lock, under the protection of this lock you can implement
cheap, simple, portable and cache friendly counts, which can be used for
synchronization.

Multiple possible solutions:
- Separate stop/exit is probably the most elegant solution.
- A call to exit does in any case start the removal of the module, that
means it starts removing interface (and which won't get reinstalled).
If there is still any user, exit will fail, you can try it later again
after you killed that user.
Anyway, almost any access to a driver goes through the filesystem and
there it's a well known problem of unlinked but still open files. Driver
access is pretty much the same problem to which you can apply the same
well known solutions.
