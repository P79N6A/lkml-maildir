We do have time allotted for maintenance of LSMs, so not only am I
interested in maintaining bsdjail on my own, but I don't even have to do
it in my free time  :)

I am "just a developer", and don't have ready access to any marketers.
There was no customer demand which we were addressing.  We just saw it
as a very useful feature easy to implement.  Some people have privately
expressed interested in the patch over the last few months as I've been
sending out patches.  And as Chris has mentioned, the vserver community
appears to be thriving, and should be partially (though by no means
fully!) served by this module.  If nothing else it should reduce the
size of the patch they need to maintain.
I wish I had a better answer...
