My machine is still not working.
I tried ...-ac5 too.
I did a little debugging. Everything seems to be detected correctly. I 
also changed the /proc/interrupts a little to see if and which IRQs are 
know to the system. IRQ's up to 21 are all IO-APIC or XT-PIC IRQ's so 
that part is fine. But I don't get any redirects
The IRQ's are distributed pretty even between the CPU's. eth1 on IRQ5 
shows just 1 IRQ and no change after pinging another of our servers. The 
data is transmitted thou, as I receive the ping on the other machine. 
The other one is also answering.
On my SMP machine I get an error that the IRQ can't be handled and that 
may be another device uses it.
There is no other device (as I stripped the machine down to nothing) The 
  printer is disabled in BIOS. PCI just shows eth1 on IRQ5. And ther is 
only one "action" in the IRQ setup.
During boot I looked at all IRQ's and printk'ed the "shared" which the 
system is checking they all show a "shared=0" --> single IRQ source.
I looked at other postings and all of them had the redirects. But all 
the Kernels were also 4GB kernels, while I am using the 64G Kernal as I 
have 4GB RAM + swap. Is there any sense in removing some RAM for testing 
or not
The issue with the freezing system is persistent. The only question is 
when. Compliling the kernel with standard "make" will hang up the system 
hard. Using the option "make -j" will work with no problem.
