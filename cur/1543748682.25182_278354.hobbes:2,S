I do too and am almost ready to throw in the towel (and I seem to be almost 
unique in experiencing these problems) - except
1) There is an open bug report on debian (#265747) of someone with the same 
model of drive having problems (and to which I added myself).  Later down the 
bug discussion someone else has chipped in with a Cyberdrive (different 
model) with problems.
3) This is absolutely consistent every run.  Its the READ BUFFER command where 
it first occurs (without DMA), and this is not the first time that data has 
been transfered (via pio).  However, under both Windows XP and linux 2.4 
(using the ide-scsi module) the drive works perfectly.
[Thinks - maybe I should spend some time looking at the 2.4 code and 
understanding the differences]
Yesterday, I eventually got to the Cyberdrive Web site (it seems to have been 
unavailable for a while) and downloaded the latest firmware upgrade.  The 
upgrade worked perfectly (had to do it under windows) and it made absolutely 
no difference.
