Well, "improve" is a bit judgemental :)

That change is fine.

No, I want to emphasize the word "exact" here.  It has to be the same.

It's not so much as a "risk" as it is what always seems to happen.  So I
don't like this change either.

No, their claim is a valid one, it's not "false".  However we are not
going to do anything about it, and as such, we don't need this kind of
wording to get people worried about it even more.
So, care to redo the patch?
Also note, there are other translations of this text already, so if you
want to change phrases like this, you might want to cc: those
maintainers as well to get their input.
