Hmm - is there anything ARM922 specific about these - i.e. is there a
reason that we shouldn't get rid of them and have some architecture
independent symbols CPU_D_CACHE_ON, CPU_I_CACHE_ON and
CPU_CACHE_WRITETHROUGH (and more to your taste) and then architectures
can use the ones which apply to them.
Doesn't seem to be a point in having dupes.
