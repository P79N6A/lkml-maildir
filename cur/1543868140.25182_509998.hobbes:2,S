+ * @version: UBI implementation version which is supposed to accept this UBI
+ * image (%UBI_VERSION)
+ * @vol_type: volume type (%UBI_VID_DYNAMIC or %UBI_VID_STATIC)
+ * @copy_flag: a flag indicating if this physical eraseblock was created by
+ * means of copying an original physical eraseblock to ensure wear-leveling.
+ * @compat: compatibility of this volume (%UBI_COMPAT_DELETE,
+ * %UBI_COMPAT_IGNORE, %UBI_COMPAT_PRESERVE, or %UBI_COMPAT_REJECT)
+ * @vol_id: ID of this volume
+ * @lnum: logical eraseblock number
+ * @leb_ver: eraseblock copy number
+ * @data_size: how many bytes of data this eraseblock contains
+ * @used_ebs: total number of used logical eraseblocks in this volume
+ * @data_pad: how many bytes at the end of this eraseblock are not used
+ * @data_crc: CRC checksum of the data stored in this eraseblock
+ * @padding1: reserved for future, zeroes
+ * @hdr_crc: volume identifier header CRC checksum
+ *
+ * The @leb_ver and the @copy_flag fields are used to distinguish between older
+ * and newer copies of the logical eraseblock, as well as to guarantee
+ * robustness against unclean reboots. As UBI erases logical eraseblocks
+ * asynchronously, in background, it has to distinguish between older and newer
+ * copies of logical eraseblocks. This is done using the @version field. On the
+ * other hand, when UBI moves data of an eraseblock, its version is also
+ * increased and the @copy_flag is set to 1. Additionally, when moving data of
+ * eraseblocks, UBI calculates data CRC and stores it in the @data_crc field,
+ * even for dynamic volumes.
+ *
+ * Thus, if there are 2 physical eraseblocks belonging to the logical
+ * eraseblock (same volume ID and logical eraseblock number), UBI uses the
+ * following algorithm to pick one of them. It first picks the one with larger
+ * version (say, A). If @copy_flag is not set, then A is picked. If @copy_flag
+ * is set, UBI checks the CRC of data of this physical eraseblock (@data_crc).
+ * This is needed to ensure that the copying was finished. If the CRC is all
+ * right, A is picked. If not, the older physical eraseblock is picked.
+ *
+ * Note, the @leb_ver field may overflow. Thus, if you have 2 versions X and Y,
+ * then X > Y if abs(X-Y) < 0x7FFFFFFF, otherwise X < Y.
+ *
+ * There are 2 sorts of volumes in UBI: user volumes and internal volumes.
+ * Internal volumes are not seen from outside and are used for various internal
+ * UBI purposes. In this implementation there is only one internal volume - the
+ * layout volume. Internal volumes are the main mechanism of UBI extensions.
+ * For example, in future one may introduce a journal internal volume. Internal
+ * volumes have their own reserved range of IDs.
+ *
+ * The @compat field is only used for internal volumes and contains the "degree
+ * of their compatibility". It is always zero for user volumes. This field
+ * provides a mechanism to introduce UBI extensions and to be still compatible
+ * with older UBI binaries. For example, if someone introduced a journal in
+ * future, he would probably use %UBI_COMPAT_DELETE compatibility for the
+ * journal volume.  And in this case, older UBI binaries, which know nothing
+ * about the journal volume, would just delete this volume and work perfectly
+ * fine. This is somewhat similar to what Ext2fs does when it is fed by an
+ * Ext3fs image - it just ignores the Ext3fs journal.
+ *
+ * The @data_crc field contains the CRC checksum of the contents of the logical
+ * eraseblock if this is a static volume. In case of dynamic volumes, it does
+ * not contain the CRC checksum as a rule. The only exception is when the
+ * data of the physical eraseblock was moved by the wear-leveling unit, then
+ * the wear-leveling unit calculates the data CRC and stores it in the
+ * @data_crc field. And of course, the @copy_flag is %in this case.
+ *
+ * The @data_size field is used only for static volumes because UBI has to know
+ * how many bytes of data are stored in this eraseblock. For dynamic volumes,
+ * this field usually contains zero. The only exception is when the data of the
+ * physical eraseblock was moved to another physical eraseblock for
+ * wear-leveling reasons. In this case, UBI calculates CRC checksum of the
+ * contents and uses both @data_crc and @data_size fields. In this case, the
+ * @data_size field contains data size.
+ *
+ * The @used_ebs field is used only for static volumes and indicates how many
+ * eraseblocks the data of the volume takes. For dynamic volumes this field is
+ * not used and always contains zero.
+ *
+ * The @data_pad is calculated when volumes are created using the alignment
+ * parameter. So, effectively, the @data_pad field reduces the size of logical
+ * eraseblocks of this volume. This is very handy when one uses block-oriented
+ * software (say, cramfs) on top of the UBI volume.
