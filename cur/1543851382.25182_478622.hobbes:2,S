Subject: [PATCH] remove pointless test of task == NULL from i386 dump_trace()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

In arch/i386/kernel/traps.c::dump_trace() there's a line that reads
  if (task && task != current)
but at the start of the function we have
  if (!task)
  	task = current;
So 'task' will never be NULL (since 'current' will never be NULL unless 
I'm very much mistaken). Which renders the test of 'task == NULL' utter 
pointless.
Removing the check should provide a microscopic speedup due to a saved 
cycle or two and in addition it certainly does save a few bytes of .text 
for traps.o  :  
before:
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
  11887    2284      52   14223    378f arch/i386/kernel/traps.o
after:
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
