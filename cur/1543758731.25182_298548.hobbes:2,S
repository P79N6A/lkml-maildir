?  
We could add a call 
int pci_was_there_an_error_during_dma (struct pci_dev);
right?  And it could return true/false, right?  I can certainly 
do that today with ppc64.  I just can't tell you which dma triggered
the problem.

well .. maybe.  On ppc64, we have one hack-ish solution for
hotplug-capable but pci-error-unaware device drivers, and that
is to hot unplug the driver, clear the pci error condition, and 
and replug the driver.  Works great for ethernet; haven't tested 
USB.
I'm getting greif from the guys over here because my hack-ish code
is hackish, and isn't arch-generic, and Paul Mackerras doesn't like it, 
which is why Benh is threatening to re-write it, and etc. ... 
which is why Seto is involved, and we're having this conversation ...
