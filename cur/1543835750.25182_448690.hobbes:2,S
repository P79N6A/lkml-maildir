Hmm, now that does complicate things then. :-/

Yes I was thinking that a GPIO is a resource a little like an IRQ and thinking 
of a registration and ownership system as well. I'm glad somebody came up with 
that suggestion!
The access API is, as you say, more difficult. The access methods for slow GPIOs 
is indeed very simple but I can't think of any way to provide (near-)direct 
access for faster accesses in a portable way. Does anyone have any suggestions?
