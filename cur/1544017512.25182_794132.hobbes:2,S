Can I ask you to redo this patch.
I want a way to swith off compression, but it should default be enable.
So if KBUILD_MODULE_NOCOMPRESS is undefined we will compress the modules
when we install them.
Something like:
      cmd_modules_install =                                               \
         mkdir -p $(2); cp $@ $(2) ;                                      \
         $(mod_strip_cmd) $(2)/$(notdir $@)                               \
         $(if $(KBUILD_MODULES_NOCOMPRESS),, ;gzip -9f $(2)/$(notdir $@))
And add documentation to Documentation/kbuild/kbuild.txt too...
Thanks,
