Sorry for the slightly long post, but I'm really curious:
After looking through "Operating systems: Internals
and design principles" by William Stallings, I seem
to have come to the conclusion that Linux's virtual
memory is very different from other systems.
For example, that book seems to imply that a system's
virtual memory size is limited to the total amount of
swap space given to the operating system. The stuff
in main memory is merely a copy of a subset of the
pages in virtual memory.
Linux doesn't work like this. For example, I have a
16M swap < 64M main memory. Pages are only assigned
to swap when memory is low.
After talking with my dad about it, he said that this
was a very different way to look at virtual memory.
Is this true? Is there something new about Linux's
way?
As an example, my dad said that under Solaris you can
start a program and then remove the disk that the
program is on. I'm fairly sure Linux can't do that.
Is there another OS that implements it this way?
If not why?
