I have to resend my patch for this issue that didn't make it through the 
linux-kernel filters.
Your patch enables FW_LOADER for everyone with (SCSI && PCI) since is a 
not user-visible option that is enabled then.
The correct solution my patch does is to add a "select FW_LOADER" to 
every single of the driver options below.
