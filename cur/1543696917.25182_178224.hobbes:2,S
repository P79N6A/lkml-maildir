I want nothing new. A BK with only the CVS exporter that you already have 
will work plain fine. We do not need even 25 exports formats. Once we 
have your existing binary that does:
bk2cvs remote-bkrepo local-cvs-repo
would be great. All other export can be based from that with local 
scripts. With a little bit less restrictive license, Is it something 
painful for BM to do?
