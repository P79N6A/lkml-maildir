Subject: [NEW PATCH] VIA IRQ quirk behaviour change
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The most recent VIA IRQ quirk changes have broken various VIA devices for
some users.  We are not able to add these devices to the blacklist as they
are also available in PCI-card form, and running the quirk on these devices
brings us back to square one (running the VIA quirk on non-VIA boards where
the quirk is not needed).
This patch, based on suggestions from Sergey Vlasov, implements a scheme
similar to but more restrictive than the scheme we had in 2.6.16 and
earlier.  It runs the quirk on all VIA hardware, but *only* if a VIA
southbridge was detected on the system.
Based on suggestions and much investigation from from Sergio Monteiro Basto,
this patch also partially reverts commit
93cffffa19960464a52f9c78d9a6150270d23785 from Bjorn Helgaas. It is not clear
if this was ever the correct fix, see 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/9/26/183
This patch additionally includes a change suggested by Linus in that thread,
where we only quirk devices on non-legacy IRQs.
There is still a downside to this patch: if the user inserts a VIA PCI card
into a VIA-based motherboard, in some circumstances the quirk will also run on
the VIA PCI card. This corner case is hard to avoid.

Andrew, please replace the current -mm patch with this one. The general idea
is that we consider applying the quirk to a lot more devices than we currently
do (more comparable to 2.6.16 and previous), but we add various bail-out
conditions to actually end up applying the quirks much less.
I am fairly confident that we'll still be quirking enough hardware to not
cause any breakage, but we can't be sure until it has seen some testing. This
is compile-tested only.
Stian Jordet: You're on CC due to a discussion linked to from above where
it appeared that you needed Bjorn's patch. Please test this patch against
unmodified 2.6.17 or 2.6.18-rc and let us know if there are any problems.
