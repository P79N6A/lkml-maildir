You're thinking about CRYPTO_AES_586.  But looking at crypto/Kconfig, 
the dependencies are a bit weird:
config CRYPTO_AES
         tristate "AES cipher algorithms"
         depends on CRYPTO && !(X86 && !X86_64)
config CRYPTO_AES_586
         tristate "AES cipher algorithms (i586)"
         depends on CRYPTO && (X86 && !X86_64)
