I'm not too sure about the refcounting here .. you never destroy the
object ? Also, why introduce your own refcounting mecanism instead of
using existing ones ? You could probably use at least a kref to get a
nice refcount + destructor instead of home made atomics based. Maybe
some higher level structure if you think it makes sense (not too sure
what this virtualization stuff is about so I can't comment on what data
structure is appropriate here).
Cheers,
Ben.
