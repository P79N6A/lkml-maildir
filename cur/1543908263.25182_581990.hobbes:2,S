Ingo: I think, you have to do this in x86_64, and there is probably
send_IPI_mask used for this (but I can miss something...).
I think, Marcin will not be able to do this and report before monday,
but,
Jean-Baptiste: of course current Ingo's or Thomas' patches are
more urgent, so if you could break the current test and try this
(maybe after Ingo acks this yet?) with eg. clean 2.6.23-rc1 or 2.6.22?
