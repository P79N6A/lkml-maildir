I am not sure if this is a problem with my machine or the code, but my
T41p does not work "correctly." [1] Pressing the sleep key (Fn-F4),
does sleep the machine, very quickly and nicely. However, on wake-up,
only an external CRT will display video. I see the LCD's backlight
come on, but no video is displayed there. I also noticed that my USB
mouse does not seem to work (this may be a BIOS setting issue, which
I'll check out on next reboot -- soon).
I have noticed that the IBM ACPI extras seems to do some things
incorrectly for me. /proc/acpi/ibm/dock always reports "status:       
 undocked," even though I'm very much docked right now. Echo'ing
auto_enable/auto_disable into /proc/acpi/ibm/video does change the
auto state, but doing the same for {lcd,crt}_{enable,disable} does
nothing (including not changing the displayed state).
I'm more than happy to try patches, BIOS setting changes, etc.
Thanks,
Nish
