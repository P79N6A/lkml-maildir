(Continued from an earlier discussion on the linux-raid list.)
I made the mistake of getting a Highpoint Rocket 1540 instead
of a Promise SATA card, and I simply can't get it to work
with the hpt366 driver in the kernel.  The driver from Highpoint
works better, but only works for the RedHat 2.4.20-8 kernel,
so I won't bother anybody with the problems with that one.
A major factor seems to be the KT600 chipset on the Abit KV7
motherboard. Is this a known issue?

Since I'm paranoid: What motherboards has it been tested and
verified with?

Interestingly enough, the Highpoint card has the same effect
when activating the first network card (it doesn't matter which
one), but only with the 2.4 kernel. The 2.6 kernel works fine.
Again, could this be a motherboard issue?
