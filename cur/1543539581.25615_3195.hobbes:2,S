You found a rulebase bug.  The `warndepend EXPERIMENTAL' in the rulebase
file was supposed to ensure that symbols dependent on EXPERIMENTAL got
(EXPERIMENTAL) appended to their prompts.  But there were a bunch of
places I wrote "unless EXPERIMENTAL suppress..."  where I should have
written "unless EXPERIMENTAL suppress dependent...".
The upshot is your EXPLs are gone but those symbol prompts should now
have (EXPERIMENTAL) appended.

If you're seeing anything but off-by-ones relating to syntax errors 
at end of line, tell me.  The off-by-ones are a known bug which I
would have to tremendously complicate the lexer to fix.

I don't know of any forward-reference problems in the 0.7.2 rulebase.
I see that you commented some stuff out.  I'll try uncommenting it and see
if I get any forward errors.

Oh!  The trailing ? doesn't mean it's a trit.  It means help is available.
Evidently you have no help entry for BLUETOOTH.

Please.  I went to some lengths to try to make it nice; if I failed, I'd
like to know why.

  "You have taught us much. Come with us and join the movement."
  "This movement of yours, does it have slogans?" inquired the Chink.
  "Right on!" they cried. And they quoted him some.
  "Your movement, does it have a flag?" asked the Chink.
  "You bet!" and they described their emblem.
  "And does your movement have leaders?"
  "Great leaders."
  "Then shove it up your butts," said the Chink. "I have taught you nothing."
