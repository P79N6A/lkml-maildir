The problem's more complex than that, so please refer to the analysis
I did in my last email to this list on the subject - the one between
the one you quote and this one. I've summarised part of it below as
well, but there's more in the previous analysis...

Precicely.
Also note that the proposed system, which I have christened SysLogFS
(for System Log File System), would carry much more than just oops
reports. As a result, it would be in pretty much constant use while
the kernel is running, so performance would be an issue here. I would
therefore see this as a two-edged sword:
 1. When doing normal system logging before an oops has occurred,
    use the normal read/write/fseek functions for performance, but
    ensure that the data makes its way out to disk as quickly as
    possible after being sent there.
 2. When dealing with an oops, use direct disk reads/writes with
    no interrupts or the like. At this point, performance becomes
    irrelevant, BUT we must ensure that any previous logged data
    that hasn't yet been written to disk gets written out as well.
In addition (and not mentioned in my previous emails), each such
message would need to be timestamped to be useful, so there would need
to be some SAFE means of determining the current time AFTER an oops
has occurred.
Like I said in my previous email, I would see the partition being used
as a circular buffer, so would propose the following structure for it:
 Q> Offset  Bytes  Description		Value
 Q> ~~~~~~  ~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~~		~~~~~
 Q>     0      8   Signature		"SysLogFS"
 Q>     8      2   Endian detector	0x55AA
 Q>    10      2   Version - Major	0x0000
 Q>    12      2   Version - Minor	0x0000
 Q>    14      2   Version - Release	0x0000
 Q>    16      8   Date last written	(Initially zero)
 Q>    24      8   Read offset		(Initially zero)
 Q>    32      8   Write offset		(Initially zero)
 Q>    40     88   Reserved		(All 0x00)
 Q>   128   rest   Buffer area		(Initially zero)
Basically, the first 128 bytes of the area are reserved for details
relating to the contents of the log, and the rest of the area are used
for the actual text to be buffered, and retain the most recent entries
made, with a NUL byte following the last entry therein.
Allowing for typical drive parameters, here's what a single cylinder
partition would allow, assuming 512 byte sectors:
 Q> Heads  Sectors  Cylinder Size  Buffer Size  Kilobytes
 Q> ~~~~~  ~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~
 Q>   16      16        131,072       130,944     127.875
 Q>   16      32        262,144       262,016     255.875
 Q>   16      63        516,096       515,968     503.875
 Q>   32      63      1,032,192     1,032,064   1,007.875
 Q>   64      63      2,064,384     2,064,256   2,015.875
 Q>  128      63      4,128,768     4,128,640   4,031.875
 Q>  255      63      8,225,280     8,225,152   8,032.375
 Q> ~~~~~  ~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~
As you can see, even with the basic 16 heads and 16 sectors per track,
there is already well over 100k of buffer per cylinder, and on modern
high capacity drives, there's nearly 8M per cylinder, both of which
are pretty decent sized logs for most uses, although multi-cylinder
partitions would of course be supported.

Whilst that would be a solution on some systems, not all systems have
suitable memory for that. As a result, there HAS to be a selection of
methods available, and I propose this as one of them, with the above
as another where available...
