But the bug has been filed for 2.6.16.4.
Did you want to say, that the latest 2.6.16 is unaffected?

What exactly did you want to tell with this sentence. Sorry, but my 
native language is german...
Is it a good solution to stay on the 2.6.16 branch? Of course I could 
use 2.6.17 or 2.6.18 but I want to update the kernel as infrequent as 
possible. After 2.6.18 there will be 2.6.19 and 2.6.20. If I continue 
that way, then I'll have more downtime than uptime.
Thank you very much in advance
Yours
Manuel
