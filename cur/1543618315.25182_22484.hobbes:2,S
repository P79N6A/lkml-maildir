Greetings,
        I've seen threads discussing this here in the past, but nothing
seems
to have come out of it. So here goes...
The problem: On exit from a kdb session in linux (with the "go"
command), the 
kernel is resumed (acpid works - i.e. the power button is the only
interface 
left!), but the console seems to be locked in some way. _Sometimes_,
hitting 
the enter key brigs up the shell prompt, but most of the time, nothing.
I don't
have another machine to use kdb on a serial console. Just tried kdb 2.1
with 
linux 2.4.17: still hangs. I've heard that stopping and starting gpm in
the 
background is a workaround, but obviously, it doesn't fix anything.
        I'd be grateful if anyone could provide a real fix or tell me
how I 
should go about the kernel's tty code to find the root of this problem.
        Thanks in advance.
