In my opinion, maintaining support for 2.4 drivers and adding new
controllers to it would be crucial for a considerable time to come even
while lk 2.6 becomes mainstream. As support, we would want to provide
support for as many kernels and controllers as possible.
From a developer standpoint, It is very difficult to maintain two drivers. I
am willing to fork iff the code is too hairy - but right now it seems very
manageable.

Now, this is some new information for me. I am not sure what is Dell's stand
on this option. Matt, Arjan?
Do we want to discover controllers and devices directed solely by kernel and
should driver interfere a little bit.

Ok.. Let us find a better solution.
