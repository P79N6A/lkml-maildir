It this the delta during one of these lockups? If so, it would seem
that although dirty pages are reported against the BDI, no actual dirty
inodes could be found.
[ note to self: writeback_inodes() seems to write out to any superblock
  in the system. Might want to limit that to superblocks on wbc->bdi ]
You say that switching to .23-rc6-mm1 solved it in your case. You are
developing in the writeback_inodes() path, right? Could it be one of
your local changes that confused it here?

That is an interesting idea how about this:
---
Subject: mm: speed up writeback ramp-up on clean systems
We allow violation of bdi limits if there is a lot of room on the
system. Once we hit half the total limit we start enforcing bdi limits
and bdi ramp-up should happen. Doing it this way avoids many small
writeouts on an otherwise idle system and should also speed up the
ramp-up.
