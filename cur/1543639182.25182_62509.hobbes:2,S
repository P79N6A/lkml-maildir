I wouldn't worry about partition detection, but network stuff
is always risky.  A "bad guy" could listen for DHCP
and try to fake a response or do a buffer overflow.
Userspace programs are supposedly easier to fix, and a
messed-up userspace isn't quite as bad as a messed up kernel
when an attacker tries to get in.  
I think kernel simplicity is the main driving factor here though.
Things that _can_ be done in userspace without major trouble
should be done in userspace.  And of course there's embedded
users who actually want to save the space currently used
by partition detection etc.  No need for that when
all your fs'es are on eprom.  No need in a diskless
workstation either.
