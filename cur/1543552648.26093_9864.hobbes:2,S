Ok, here is a list of places within the kernel that access the PIT
timer, plus the method of locking (i386 arch only):
Usage:						Lock method:
arch/i386/kernel/time.c:170:			spin_lock()
arch/i386/kernel/time.c:491:			spin_lock()
arch/i386/kernel/time.c:575:			none (init)
arch/i386/kernel/i8259.c:491:			none (init)
arch/i386/kernel/apm.c:871:			cli()
arch/i386/kernel/apic.c:398:			spin_lock_irqsave()
drivers/char/vt.c:121:				cli()
drivers/char/ftape/lowlevel/ftape-calibr.c:80:	cli()
drivers/char/ftape/lowlevel/ftape-calibr.c:99: 	cli()
drivers/char/joystick/analog.c:142:		cli() __cli()
drivers/char/joystick/gameport.c:66:		cli()
drivers/ide/hd.c:137:   		 	cli()
drivers/ide/ide.c:206:  		  	__cli()
I guess we'll need to fix this. While races here are not likely (the
most likely is a beep by vt.c at a wrong moment), they're possible.
However, these don't seem to be the cause of the problem we see here
anyway.
