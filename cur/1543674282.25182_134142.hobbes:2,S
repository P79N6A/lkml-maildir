"THE ABI" does not consitute "THE EXISTING PART OF AN ABI".  They are
two different things.

No, it's not.  It provides a chance to fix bugs quickly and easily.
Furthermore, it provides a clean, uniform way to distribute ABI
extensions.

Syscall numbers are an extremely bad example (ioctl structures is more
like it), but since you brought it up: how would you deal with the
hypotetical case that two syscalls were assigned the same number?
You're screwed no matter what, and making it hard to fix doesn't improve
the situation in any way.

Things *DO* have to be maintained in concert if you want to get things
done.  I'm not talking atomic changes as I'm talking getting changes in
within a reasonable time frame.

And your proposal for this is...?
Let's face it, you're going to need these kinds of things.  You're also
going to need a way to push these features into use.  You're also going
to want to have an automated way to make things like strace (my personal
favourite debugging tool) produce useful output.

What it really is is an ABI specification, not documentation.  The
difference is that the specification *is* the ABI, by definition,
whereas documentation is a *description* of what the ABI is.  The latter
may or may not be up to date and correct.
Automation prevents bugs.  This is a good thing.
