Dividing a badness score by 8 if a task's set of allowable nodes do not 
insect with the oom triggering task's set does not make an otherwise 
deterministic algorithm non-deterministic.
I don't understand what you're arguing for here.  Are you suggesting that 
we should not prefer tasks that intersect the set of allowable nodes?  
That makes no sense if the goal is to allow for future memory freeing.

It handles it very well, cpusets are a client of cgroups and the 
/dev/mem_notify extension would be as well.  So to handle lowmem 
notifications for your cpuset, you would mount both cgroup subsystems at 
the same time and then poll() on the mem_notify file.  It would be 
responsible for the aggregate of tasks that the cgroup represents.
If lowmem notifications are implemented in the reclaim path, this is much 
easier for cpusets than for the memory controller, actually, since we 
already collect per-node ZVC information.

The goal should not be to override the kernel's choice, because that 
decision depends heavily on the type of oom and the state of the machine 
at the time.  Appropriate changes to the oom killer's heuristics are 
always welcome; in my opinion, we should probably penalize tasks that do 
not intersect the triggering task's set of allowable nodes more than we 
currently do.
I think you'll find that your goals can be accomplished with a mem_notify 
cgroup and that it is a much more powerful interface so that your 
userspace policy can be better informed, especially if it is aware of 
lowmem situations where oom conditions are imminent.
