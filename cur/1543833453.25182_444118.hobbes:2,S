That's not why I reacted. I reacted because the code is ugly, and would be 
much cleaner if it had everything in one place.
Btw, the variable size for !LOCKDEP is totally irrelevant: you need to 
have it inside the #ifdef LOCKDEP _anyway_, if only yo shut up gcc about 
unused static variables. Which you did do, by duplicating the function 
(once empty), and having an #else part to it all.
