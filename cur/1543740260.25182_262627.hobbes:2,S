Hi guys,
with 2.6.9 hibernation to disk finally works! Thanks
To ram it still don't work, system starts with lcd disabled - but it is 
another story.
I have now this problem - when I hibernate and then system is started up in 
other company, it don't update time and shows still for example 14:00 - when 
I rehibernate for example in 20:00 - could you ask bios for current time? 
It's better to have bad time about few seconds instead of hours.
Same problem with dhcp - it should ask for IP when rehibernate.
Thanks for fixing
Michal
