I suspect it's the X server that makes your G550 go black.
XOrg-X11-6.8.2 RC1 or RC2 fixes that by introducing a VGAAccess
option for its radeon driver. I recompiled xorg-x11-6.8.1 with this
fix on my FC3 system. It made the only thing that annoyed me
using the linuxconsole.sf.net ruby patch go away.
I have a Radeon 7000VE PCI and a Radeon 9200SE AGP8x.
Every time I logged out on the first X ( localhost:0 ),
it made the other one (localhost:1) go blank.
With the above mentioned fix (that I collected from the XOrg devel
mailing list and was made by Ben Herrenschmidt) applied to XOrg
and using
Option "VGAAccess" "on"
on the card that is set up for VGA by the BIOS and
Option "VGAAccess" "off"
on the other, this problem went away. This modification disables
using the "vgahw" module in XOrg and unfortunately only applicable
to the radeon driver. BTW this patch was made for specifically
for systems that don't use vgacon, like PPC that don't even have
legacy VGA and for others that use radeonfb.
I guess the VGA routing patch and X cooperation will also
solve "the other VGA(s) in the system go blank when I fire up X"
in a generic way, not only for Radeons.
