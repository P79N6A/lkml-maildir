Hello,
I'm seeing to following (obscure) thing happening:
I open an xterm, it gets the pseudo term: pts/1
I close the term and open a new one: pts/2, in stead
of pts/1.
Like this:
USER     TTY      FROM   LOGIN@   IDLE   JCPU   PCPU WHAT
miekg    pts/1    arena  19:57    3.00s  0.24s  0.11s vi bla
miekg    pts/4    arena  20:03    0.00s  0.06s  0.00s w
$ logout
login again:
USER     TTY      FROM   LOGIN@   IDLE   JCPU   PCPU WHAT
miekg    pts/1    arena  19:57    3.00s  0.25s  0.12s vi bla
miekg    pts/5    arena  20:03    0.00s  0.05s  0.00s w
        ^^^^^^^
It just counts on.... 
I'm using devfs on 2.6.4-rc3, I first noticed this in 2.6.3.
(all 2.6.4-rcX have it),
Does anybody know why this is happening?
grtz Miek
