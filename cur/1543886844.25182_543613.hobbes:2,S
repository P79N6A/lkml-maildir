I said "and should _continue_ to be (the purpose of this document)
written within that context, then that's your opinion". That "is" before
the "and should ..." was not meant to be combined with "your
opinion".

And that is not what I attempt to do (or even suggest) either. Which is
why I do *not* disagree with the jiffies clause -- it exists in that
document merely to _inform_ readers about _current_ behaviour /
dialect of the kernel and not to influence code written in the future.
The problem with the last clause is that it explicitly influences
*future* code (by coming in as a "rare situation where volatile
makes sense in the kernel").

If you remember my original mail was in the "_why_ use volatile" tone,
which means to _dissuade_ future spurious additions of volatile to the
kernel. Now this _is_ a matter of opinion: I personally prefer as much
(if not all) future code to be dialect-independent, you might not.
