modules.conf already breaks FHS lib/ badly enough.  Modules loaded
before /var is mounted won't get persistant data.  Too bad; they
have to do something sane when it doesn't exist anyway.

You need versions: binary data is too prone to change (proven kernel
history).  It's the kernel installer's duty to know which ones can be
safely linked/copied to the new version.
Otherwise every data change requires a new symbol name: and this will
happen all the time.
Rusty.
