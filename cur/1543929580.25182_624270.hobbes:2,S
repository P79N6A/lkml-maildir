Pretty sad that such an interesting security bug didn't make it to
either of the /dev/random maintainers.

It's possible that on machines with no real entropy, the initial
startup seeds were having no effect on the /dev/urandom output.
That's fixed here:
http://www.kernel.org/hg/linux-2.6/rev/8298e254985e
which would have been in v2.6.22-rc4 through the normal CVE process.
The only other bits in there are wall time and utsname, so systems
with no CMOS clock would behave repeatably. Can we find out what
kernels are affected?

Any other details would be interesting.
