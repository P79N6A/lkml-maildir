No, we'll only know if we merge something that does plugins at the VFS
level in a well-designed way.

Very poorly.  There's only two interpretations of "ext3 as a reiser4 plugin"
that make *any* sense.  The first is that reiser4 is totally violating the VFS
layer boundary, and the second is that reiser4 is trying to be an all-singing
all-dancing wankfest.  Later on, you say:

Now *think* for a moment - how does a hypothetical Reiser4 using ext3 format
gain any speed advantage with small files, when the speed advantage is based
on using a format other than ext3?
As I said, either it's violating the VFS boundary, or it's busy wanking.
The Reiser4 proponents would be well served to disavow that particular
hypothetical example - I have yet to see *anything* that does more damage
to the Reiser4 cause.

Or we can do what *should* be done, which is:
a) Put the crack pipe down.
b) Tell reiser4 to get its grubby little paws off the VFS if it ever intends
to have a chance of being merged in mainline.
c) Have a *separate* project to improve the speed/reliability/function of
the VFS layer, which is the only way that your vision of having the ext3 and
reiser developers cooperating will ever happen.
Yes, the VFS could probably use an overhaul.  But that *will* happen like this:
1) A patch is submitted and passes review to change the VFS.
2) If appropriate, a patch for reiser4 (if it gets merged) is also submitted
(possibly by the same people) to be the first user of the new API/functionality.
There's a *reason* why we see patch streams that look like:
Patch 1/3: Add moby_foo_init function to nautical core.
Patch 2/3: Modify white_whale driver to use moby_foo_init
Patch 3/3: Modify captain_ahab driver to use moby_foo_init

I don't think this is what they mean by "Linux gives you enough rope to
shoot yourself in the foot with"...

You've totally failed to understand that the whole *point* of PGP is that 'vim
/some/encrypted/file' *isnt* easy to do.  A better example might be the various
crypto-loop-ish variants or Microsoft's EFS, where the key management model is
more tractable to this sort of automation.
