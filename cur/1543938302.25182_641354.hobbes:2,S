Current x86.git doesn't have .set_pgd or .pgd_clear fields on
pv_mmu_ops.
Those fields, and the implementations of set_pgd(), __pud() and pud_val()
were missing on the last series from Glauber. I will send the missing
bits today.

On the patches I will send, pud_clear() and pgd_clear() aren't present
on pv_mmu_ops and are implemented using set_pud() and set_pgd().
