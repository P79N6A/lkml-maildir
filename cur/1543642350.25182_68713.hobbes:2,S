Does pre4-ac do the same ? There is a change or two in the irq masking on
the probes and this does sound like an IRQ jam up. (You might find removing
the card unjams the kernel - depends)
I've tried duplicating the problem here loading an IDE PCMICA card and
I get the usual behaviour - it hangs briefly then continues happily. The
hang needs looking at - it seems we may have some IRQ handling issues 
there anyway
