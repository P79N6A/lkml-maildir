Yes, that's correct.

Ok, effectively what you have there is a signature on an entire file stored in
one of its extended attributes, so I suspect you could think of few other
applications for something like this too.

Ok, so:
1. Admin is trusted. [ This need not mean the same as: "superuser
_account_ is trusted", but let's stay in the real world in for now. ]
2. Signing happens at some central, assumed-to-be-secure location (and say
the private key never leaves that central secure location). And let's say the
admin *repackages* the packages, this time such that the signed files get the
signature-carrying-extended-attributes with them, so the installation
automatically copies them correctly. => nothing wrong with this assumption.
3. Kernel verifies signatures at runtime. => kernel is trusted.
4. Public key needs to be *compiled into* the kernel ... so this is not getting
into mainline, but fair enough as something site administrators would patch in
and build.
5. Chain-of-trust handled in userspace. => userspace is trusted.
Let me know if I got the trust model / key management wrong.

Well, if you're trusting (privileged) userspace already, I'm suddenly
not so sure
as to what new is this patchset bringing to the table in the first
place ... could
you also describe the attack vectors / threats that you had in mind that get
blocked with the proposed scheme?

Have a look at modsign (signed kernel modules) project too (just the key
management part, specifically the asymmetric crypto and DSA implementation
that they've already ported to the kernel). You could also go through the lkml
archives for whenever that was proposed for inclusion in mainline ...
