Yes, it is. You can certainly view the padding as an implicit part of 
the real-mode code, which is why the current statement isn't wrong -- 
there is simply room for improvement.

The fact that the protected-mode code starts at that address is already 
mentioned under the heading "LOADING THE REST OF THE KERNEL" (where 
protected mode is for some reason referred to as "non-real-mode").
(Please note that the header field is called "setup_sects", not 
"setup_sectors".)
