Have you got any idea how QA is done in closed environments?

Perhaps because of the same phenomenon that made MS state "WinNT 4.0 has no
flaws" when asked about a nasty problem shortly after release, and it is
now at sp6a + numerous "hotfixes". Like Win2k which now has sp2. Like
Solaris, which still is being fixed. Etc, ad nauseam. Complex software
*has* bugs, bugs which aren't apparent except under unsusual circumstances
are rarely found in the first round of bug chasing.

Report it to the vendor, through the documented channels?
