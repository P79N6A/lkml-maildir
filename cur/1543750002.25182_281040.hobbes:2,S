Yes, I'm testing with ping and basing my idea of the
packet flow on printk().

Does this mean that when the reply (response) packet
is sending out through xfrm_lookup(), the sk parameter
of xfrm_lookup() will not be NULL? and When the
incoming packet itself goes through xfrm_lookup(), the
sk parameter will be NULL?
