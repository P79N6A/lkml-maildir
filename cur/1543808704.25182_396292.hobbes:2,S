Good point.
In general this comes under the heading of "when doing highly available
computing, ensure each of your computing replicas get exactly the same
inputs and always double-check their outputs".
There are lots of 'inputs' that affect the state of the system; when I
referred to "/dev/random and the system clock", I was figuratively
referring to these.  Others might include timing of disk IO events, for
instance.
I'd rather not discuss this too much; it was intended to be a flippant
"wishful thinking" thought, and is certainly not something I have spent
the necessary time investigating to discuss well :).
Sam.
