This is what he wants, a workaround so he can fsck.  However, the above 
command (on version 1.2-WIP) just gives me:
   Invalid filesystem option set: ^FEATURE_C4
Maybe he should just edit the source so it doesn't set the superblock flag 
for now.
BTW, there doesn't seem to be a --version command in tune2fs.
