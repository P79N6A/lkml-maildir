Hi everybody,
I noticed a conversation some days ago that also mentioned something
about PLX chips and a certain problem resulting in loss of interrupt
signals.
I'm writing a driver for a PCI-based device (an embedded USB Host
Controller) and it uses a PLX bridge (device ID 5406). Although I've set
up the device correctly and a logical analyzer shows the interrupts
being generated on the USB HC chip, nothing comes past the bridge, thus
nothing reaches the system. I use a typical pci_enable_device() followed
but some request_region() and of course request_irq() on a kernel
2.6.10-rc3 (i386 system, VIA KT133, no APIC...)
Does this have something to do with the discussion about PLX chips
mentioned above? If it does, can anybody make clear what I have to do to
see those interrupts coming?
You can find the mail in question at:

Thanks,
Dimitris
