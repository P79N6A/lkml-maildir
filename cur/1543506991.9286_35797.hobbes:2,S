Subject: [PATCH] 2.3.14 leaves CDROM drive door locked
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

On 2.3.14 the CD drive door is often locked where it shouldnt.
Repeat by:
    Put an audio CD in the ATAPI drive.
    Invoke the program
	#include <fcntl.h>
	main(){
		int i = open("/dev/cdrom", O_RDONLY);
	        if (i < 0)
		        perror("/dev/cdrom");
	}
    This will yield the output
	/dev/cdrom: Wrong medium type
    and now the drive door is locked, so that one
    cannot replace the CD by the right one.
Explanation:
    At various points the driver does a check media change,
    which calls cdrom_check_status, which does a TEST_UNIT_READY.
    However, the routine cdrom_queue_packet_command will always
    lock the door unless called with one of a few commands,
    and TEST_UNIT_READY is not one of those. So, each
    cdrom_check_status, and each check media change will
    lock the door. (Even after an eject the tray is withdrawn
    and the door is closed again.)
    This behaviour is avoided by making TEST_UNIT_READY one
    of the exceptions in cdrom_queue_packet_command.
