Ooh, fast and chip RAM :) Not exactly different speeds (as far as the RAM is
concerned), it ws just that the processor had exclusive access to fast RAM,
where as the custom chips (co-processors, a.k.a the PAD) had priority access to
the chip RAM. IIRC, there was also 'slow RAM' on some systems, which the PAD 
couldn't access but which got isolated from the processor when the chip RAM was
being used by the PAD.
