Technical explanations aside, some sort of clock drift exists in all 
computers. My experience with Sun hardware, for instance, was that the 
hardware and software clocks rarely agreed.
You should set up your machines to use some sort of time synchronization 
software, such as ntp or rdate. When I didn't have a 24/7 net presence, I had 
my ppp script run ntpdate when the connection was complete.
