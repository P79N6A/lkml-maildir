Yeah? So the Linux kernel now requires a specific vendor distribution?
Since when?
So, to get the proper documentation of the Linux Kernel, I now
need to purchase a vendor's distribution??? I think not. I think
the sys-calls need to be documented and I think that I have established
proof of that supposition.

MMAP(2)             Linux Programmer's Manual             MMAP(2)
NAME
       mmap, munmap - map or unmap files or devices into memory
SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/types.h>
       #include <sys/mman.h>
       caddr_t  mmap(caddr_t  addr,  size_t  len,  int prot , int
       flags, int fd, off_t offset );
       int munmap(caddr_t addr, size_t len);
DESCRIPTION
       WARNING: This is a BSD man page.  Linux 0.99.11 can't  map
       files, and can't do other things documented here.
       The  mmap  function  causes the pages starting at addr and
       continuing for at most len bytes to  be  mapped  from  the
       object  described  by  fd, starting at byte offset offset.
       If offset or len is not a multiple of  the  pagesize,  the
       mapped region may extend past the specified range.

Why is the government concerned about the lunatic fringe? Think about it.
