    Hi Jens, and thanks a lot for answering :)

    Yes, the hard disk is primary master, the writer secondary
master.

    The VP_IDE, with a VIA 82c686b chipset.

    Yes, if I use the IDE-CD driver, hdparm reports that the writer
is UDMA2 capable

    2.00. Latest is 2.00.3, although I don't know if it is stable,
I've seen it this morning.

    Currently I have a DIY linux box, and I'm not sure if I can test
a 2.5 kernel without updating lots of software. I've tested with
2.4.18 (which AFAIK has another IDE driver) and the same happens. I
think that maybe the motherboard is damaged :((
    I'll try the newer cdrecord (if it is stable) and, if that
doesn't work, I may consider testing 2.5
    Thanks for your answer :)
