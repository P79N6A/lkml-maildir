Subject: [2.6 patch] fix arm26 THREAD_SIZE
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

arm26 currently has a 256 kB THREAD_SIZE (sic).
Looking at the comment in the code, this seems to be based on a 
misunderstanding.
The comment says:
this needs attention (see kernel/fork.c which gets a nice div by zero if 
this is lower than 8*32768
kernel/fork.c does:
  max_threads = mempages / (8 * THREAD_SIZE / PAGE_SIZE)
Therefore, a division by 0 is impossible for all reasonable cases with
THREAD_SIZE >= PAGE_SIZE.
Since the minimum PAGE_SIZE Linux uses on the arm26 architecture is 16k, 
PAGE_SIZE should be sufficient for THREAD_SIZE.
