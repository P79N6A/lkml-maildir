HPA is damn _right_.
But there is something true in Mathias statement. 
It is very hard to follow whole kernel updates.
Too few people feels responsible to document what they
change. I'm writing kernel code from 1996 and there is
no big difference since then. I spend most of my time
find-ing and grep-ing .../linux directory. I think
Linus has a hard job ;-)
For example i can't find any recent(2.2/2.3) kernel
guides/docs. I mean as a whole thing (there are really
good docs in linux/Documentation).
