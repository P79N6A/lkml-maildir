Another option is to check for the disabled flag explicitly.  The check prior
to the disable could arguably be removed, but the check prior to the
enable is necessary.  If the interrupt has been explicitly disabled, as with
the IRQ_DISABLED flag, then it will take an explicit effort to re-enable it.
