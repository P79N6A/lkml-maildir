Oh, I see. I just didn't get your idea. This will work, but
1. we separate interrupt accounting from all the others'
2. for interrupts only. In case we want to set init_bc as
   temporary context all will be broken...
We need some generic solution independent from what
exactly is set as temporary exec_bc.

Could work, but whether everyone will like such intrusion...
I agree that stop_machine isn't nicer. This is a temporary
solution that works for sure. Better one will follow...
