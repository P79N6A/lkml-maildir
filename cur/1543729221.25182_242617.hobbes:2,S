Hi,
This is the first time I am seeing this error while recompiling the
kernel. Could someone plz explain what it means and how to fix it.
I get this error message when I run the command 'make install'. Till this
point everything else works out properly.
Error Message
-------------
All of your loopback devices are in use.
mkinitrd failed
The commands run before this were
make mrproper
make menuconfig
make dep
make bzImage
make modules and
make modules_install
Thanks,
Rahul.
