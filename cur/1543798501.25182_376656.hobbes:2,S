kmalloc(..., GFP_ATOMIC) is the way to allocate memory in irq context.
It's done that way throughout the kernel.

The rest of Linux appears to work fine without needing such mechanisms...
I really fail to see why you think SPI needs that.  USB isn't the only
counterexample, but it's particularly relevant since both USB and SPI
use asynchronous message passing over serial links ... and USB has a
rather complete driver stack over it.   (None of the USB based WLAN
drivers need those static buffers you worry about, by the way...)

We would call those "driver bugs" and expect patches.  :)

That's not the way it works though.  And you seem to have made up
a "losing the transfer" failure mode out of whole cloth; I have no
idea where that came from.

Huh, well I've already seen one nice "mmc/sd over SPI" driver, using
a slightly earlier version of the framework than is found in mm3.
It's being used for root filesystems.
So demonstrably there is no problem for MMC/SD, either.
