No, it's not.  Its behavior should be consistent, and the only sensible
way to do that is to have it make the filesystem and not format the media.
I'm sure you'd be somewhat miffed if you used mke2fs to build a filesystem
on /dev/sd0e and it decided to format the whole drive, wiping out the
rest of your partitions!

You've been making filesystems on already formatted media, nothing more.
