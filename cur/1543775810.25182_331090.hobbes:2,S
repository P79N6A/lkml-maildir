Con,
	We've done some more testing with this with results that are still 
disappointing.  We think that one reason for this is that move_tasks() 
doesn't take "nice" into account.  I'm going to look at modifying it so 
that it moves a certain amount of niceness rather than a specified 
number of tasks.
	A second (more difficult to solve) issue is that we think it would work 
better if both queue lengths and "nice" loads were kept approximately 
equal between the queues.  It's hard to see how this can be managed 
without considerable overhead.
Peter
