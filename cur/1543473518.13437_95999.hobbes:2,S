First of all congratulations Linus and Allan for your fine work!
2.2.0-pre1-ac2 working here like a charm.
Extensive testing of 'large fd' moving around about 500 MB
of small (jpg) files without any problems and using normal
partitions and RAID0.
Software is based on an upgraded RedHat-5.2 (using Andrea's sendfile
patch for fileutils! -nice hack-)
Hardware is Tyan SMP-1.4 dual PII with 0.5 GB RAM two Buslogics and six
SCSI disks (mixed fast, wide and ultra), CD-ROM and CD-Writer,
Matrox-G200
(using framebuffer) and XFree-3.3.3 (sw_cursor option needed), de4x5 @
100Mb
full duplex.
Kernel compiled with RH52 standard egcs using options '-O2
-mpentiumpro'.
It may be a subjetive feeling but I thing that SMP works better now.
