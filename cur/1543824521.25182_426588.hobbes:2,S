Well, the two functions have a long history...
There has been a PG_activate which makes the two functions quite
different. It was later removed for fear of the behavior changes it
introduced. However, there's still possibility that someone
reintroduce similar flags in the future :)

Ah, here's another theory: the algorithm uses reference count
conceptually, so it may be better to retain the current form.
