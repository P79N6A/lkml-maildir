That's not just i-cache pressure.  It is partly a GCC problem, and
it's possible -Os would run faster than -O2 even with no i-cache.
I've observed -Os emitting exactly the same code as -O2 for some
trivial functions, except that -O2 has a few extra redundant
instructions.
Obvious the _intent_ of -O2 is to compile for speed, but it's clear
that GCC often emits trivially redundant instructions (like stack
adjustments) that don't serve to speed up the program at all.
