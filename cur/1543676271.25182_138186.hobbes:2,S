Sorry, I don't see that in the current kernel version of cardbus.c,
otherwise I would not have moved it out.  Feel free to put it back, if
you need it for any future cardbus changes.
Oh, and I was looking at cardbus.c when doing these changes and saw this
old comment:
/*
 * This file is going away.  Cardbus handling has been re-written to be
 * more of a PCI bridge thing, and the PCI code basically does all the
 * resource handling. This has wrappers to make the rest of the PCMCIA
 * subsystem not notice that it's not here any more.

Is that ever going to happen?  Just curious, because if so, I can remove
some more functions from pci.h :)
thanks,
