Thanks for responding :)
The fact that no-one is told to use the new right way (tm) in any  
available documentation does not help matters improve. One issue is  
that the 'asynchronous' interface seems to rely on the same 'dodgy'  
timeout mechanism as the original request_firmware() call... Looks  
like the lack of a maintainer should be the opportunity for a rework  
of this API.
