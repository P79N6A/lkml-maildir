This by itself doesn't fix the problem of too-fast timeout errors on
soft mounts (e.g. returning EIO within <0.1s).
I am still seeing the fs get into a state where each time a large file
is written, it reports EIO (but writes successfully anyway).  And "ls
-R" still shows EIO errors also.

I haven't tried this yet.  It doesn't apply to 2.5.74 due to the calls
to io_schedule().
