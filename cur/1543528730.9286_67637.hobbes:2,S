it's a feature, right. but a buggy one. RTFmail a few more lines
and you'll see why.
the problem is in lookup_dentry()
if a process looks up "." on a mounted directory and it was inside it before
the mount, then
...
                dentry = reserved_lookup(base, &this);
dentry = pwd of this process, the old (covered) /mnt.
                if (!dentry) {
                        dentry = cached_lookup(base, &this, flags);
                        if (!dentry) {
                                dentry = real_lookup(base, &this, flags);
                                if (IS_ERR(dentry))
                                        break;
                        }
                }
                /* Check mountpoints.. */
                dentry = follow_mount(dentry);
		^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
and now it's the new (mounted) /mnt.
so ls . will show you the mounted directory, but ls -l fails because
it's trying to stat files of the mounted directory in the covered directory.
I've appended a tentative fix below, need to check it. look ok ?
