so i haven't had a chance to dig into this further, but i think there may
be some .PRECIOUS foo missing.  i had hit ^C a few times to cancel out a
"make -j3 dep", and a "make -j3 bzImage" while i tweaked other things...
and somehow in the process include/linux/sunrpc/svcsock.h disappeared.
i notice two files where svcsock.h appears on the LHS of a make rule --
.hdepend and tmp_include_depends.  .hdepend has a .PRECIOUS entry, but
tmp_include_depends doesn't.
maybe one of those files wasn't generated properly when i hit ^C during
the "make -j3 dep"?  after the ^C i re-configured and re-did make dep...
but i recall after the make menuconfig it didn't tell me i needed to do
the make dep... and i know it didn't finish the first make dep.
anyhow, sorry i haven't tried to reproduce it, just thought i'd mention it
though.
