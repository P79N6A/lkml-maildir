Subject: USB mouse freezes under X, 2.5.69-mm3

I occasionally see my USB mouse freeze up under X11 on a Red Hat 9
system running 2.5.69-mm3.  It completely stops responding to events
until I either switch virtual terminals or restart X, then magically
comes back to life.
There are no entries in /var/log/messages to indicate what might be
going on, so I'm quite mystified.
This is on a system with USB compiled in modular form, though I notice
that, weirdly enough, the refcounts on everything USB-related except
usbcore are zero (i.e. hid, uhci_hcd, ehci_hcd), even though I'm using
the USB mouse right now.
