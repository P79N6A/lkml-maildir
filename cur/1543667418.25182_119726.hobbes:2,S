This sentence is ambiguous and one of its possible meanings is
"Most people do and Robert Love suspects Alan Cox does, too," which
is also probably what you meant.  A bit strong a statement, don't you
think?  How can you know the opinion of most people here?
As a sidenote, I consider it important to note that it's obvious
that if Alan were the 2.4 maintainer, we would likely have a 2.4.21
with the critical (and possibly other) fixes out and all the fancy
new stuff rescheduled for 2.4.22.
