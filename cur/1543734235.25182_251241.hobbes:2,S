Its a shame the DRI people having nothing better to do than tell folks
to shut up or mutter FUD about things they don't grasp. You've almost
got the point by now at least.
The IDE CD and IDE disk drivers do both write to registers on the IDE
controller directly - often the same registers. The reason it doesn't
end up in a nasty heap is because the core IDE code does co-ordination. 
Two drivers, independant drivers, an access protocol an the ability for
some entity to co-ordinate them and lo - it all works.

That appears to be the pet religion but repeating bullshit doesn't make
it true.

Because they are not different, and you can write such a formatting
driver providing it follows the IDE access protocols in the core code.
You won't have to modify existing IDE drivers either. It works because
the co-ordination layer is there.

They also support a lot more hardware than you do of course, and on
platforms that DRI doesn't support.
What is actually so hard about driver code that instead looks like
my_fb_attach_notify(struct vga_dev *dev, int type)
{
	if(type == TYPE_DRI)
	{
		me->fb_ops = &dri_ops;
		my_fb_dri_init(dev);
		return 0;
	}
	if(type == TYPE_OVERLAY && dev->rev < 0xC4) /* Errata */
		return -EINVAL; /* Refuse overlays in fb mode */
}
or
	down(&dev->lock);
	vga_quiesce_all_drivers(dev);
	do nasty non parallel stuff
	up(&dev->lock);
This is essentially what the IDE layer does, although its closer to
	queue_this_function_and_args_to_list(dev, callback, args);
	if(!doing_stuff);
		begin_queue_run(dev);
Either model works
