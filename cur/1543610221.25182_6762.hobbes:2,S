If it will go into mainstream, please change it to config option or
something like that. I'm doing 
for a in /dev/hd[a-z]; do hdparm -Y $a; done
in my poweroff script. With -ac /sbin/halt then stops on each disk 
for couple of seconds, because of drive in sleep mode does not respond,
and so IDE driver has to timeout, reinit interface and flush cache
(fortunately drive does not spin up again).
                                        Thanks,
