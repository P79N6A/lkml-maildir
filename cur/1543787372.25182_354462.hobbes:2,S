Actually the notion of doing _that_ predated that "recent" ACPI stuff,
since from time to time people with OHCI in ASICs (and without ACPI)
have said they need to run with a patch doing just that.
Which is why regardless of that other ACPI-ish issue, I'd like to
hear test results on this one.  I suspect they'll be "OHCI resume
breaks for other reasons", unfortunately, but that's one reason we
have a 2.6.15 cycle upcoming.  (And such reports would put a rather
different complexion on this whole recent thread too ... ;)

The patch above would be orthogonal to that issue, though ...
If we change how usbcore does this stuff -- so hcd-pci.c won't release
and later re-allocate the IRQ -- I don't think I'd object.  But I'd
rather do it in the 2.6.15 cycle, since as I understand things the
bug that restores that "ACPI braindamage" is only in the MM tree, and
there have been _no failures at all_ reported using mainstream kernels.
