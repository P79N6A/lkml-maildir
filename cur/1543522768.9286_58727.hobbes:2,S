Having an open relay is about as bad as doing the spamming, so no
problem
with blacklisting them.  Do you do something about a person that
leaves loaded guns lying in the streets, or do you wait till a 4-year
old pick one up and accidentally shoot someone?  Similiar situation,
although
the consequences are much worse.
