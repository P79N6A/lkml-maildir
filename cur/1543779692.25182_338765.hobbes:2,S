We don't want BE to be an "option" per se; as developers we'd just like to
be able to compile it that way to verify gfs's endianness handling.  If
you think that's unmaintainable or a bad idea we'll rip it out.

OK, it looks like we need to block/flush signals a la daemonize(); I guess
I mistakenly figured the kthread routines did everything daemonize did.
Thanks,
