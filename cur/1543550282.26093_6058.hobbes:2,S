I really didn't want to make a comment on this stupid thread but now

You are excused this one and only time since I am fortunate enough to
never have met you but listen carefully now:
  I allow nobody to tell me what to do.
Nobody from Red Hat ever tried to do this.  If this would have been on
the mind of somebody (which I doubt) this illusion would have been
destroyed on the first day when I told them that this never would be
an option.  There are external entities (commercial and
non-commercial) who try this, though, of course without success
either.

And this I take as personal insult.  Who the f*ck do you think you are
to claim the right of making such a statement?  This is so completely
insane that I really have not the slightest idea how you can make
something like this up.  Go and find somebody who is working on glibc
to back up this "statement" and not some idiot like you who has no
inside whatsoever.  If you cannot find anybody I demand a public
apology from you.
