On x86_64 in particular, if CONFIG_UNORDERED_IO is defined.  Regular
wmb() is implemented as a compiler memory barrier then, which isn't
sufficient for PCI write combining.

I used this for symmetry with <asm/system.h> where other barriers are
defined.  It could obviously go into io.h instead, since it's an
MMIO-related barrier, but I didn't want to separate it from other
barriers.
If you have a location you'd prefer, please let me know.

Looks like it should be defined there, too, something like this perhaps:
#define wc_wmb() alternative("lock; addl $0,0(%%esp)", "sfence", X86_FEATURE_XMM)
Does that look right?
