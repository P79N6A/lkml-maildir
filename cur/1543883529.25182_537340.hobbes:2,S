I'd like to explain this a bit, for people seeing these messages who haven't
been following this part of dvb development.
dvb-pll is a simple driver for a number of I2C tuners, which are used in
many many TV cards.
These are simple devices, and drivers for host controllers (which usually
support quite a few different models of tv card based on the same core chip)
often didn't use dvb-pll.  They would just re-implement an I2C tuner driver,
sometimes more than once in the same file!
The dvb tree ended up with over a dozen different re-implementations of the
same basic tuner driver.  Of course each implementation would have different
bugs, quirks, and missing features.
So we've been removing this code and using dvb-pll.  If you look at some of
my patches to do this:
 14 files changed, 14 insertions(+), 199 deletions(-)
 1 files changed, 4 insertions(+), 34 deletions(-)
 4 files changed, 17 insertions(+), 204 deletions(-)
These patches fixed bugs and added features, yet are very much net negative
when if comes to lines of code in the kernel.

dvb-pll has nothing to do with VIDEO_V4L1_COMPAT or VIDEO_V4L1.  Uwe is just
confused about what is causing what.

Uwe is probably talking about the dvb_attach() system, written mainly by
Andrew de Quincey and myself, which went into 2.6.18.  The basic concept is
that a core driver uses symbol_request() to avoid any strong references to
its helper drivers.  This way only the helper drivers that are actually
needed must be loaded.  We want to make dvb-pll use this system too, but it
doesn't fully work yet.  I have several ideas about how to solve the
problem, but it's not a high priority.
