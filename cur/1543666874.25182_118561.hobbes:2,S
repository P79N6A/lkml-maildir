Hi all :) 
Got a hardlock starting XFree 4.3.0 with ATI Technologies Inc Rage 128 Pro Ultra TF
Working config
I have DRI enabled in kernel as well as in XF86Config.
using r128 driver for X
I can enable GLX in XF86Config in 2.4.20 kernel.
(gentoo-sources) 
Broken config (reproducable everytime)
I have DRI enabled in kernel as DRI and GLX as in XF86Config.
using r128 driver for X
X starts up with mouse cursor garbage at the top and system is dead.
not even reset button works.
here is some system information
CHOST="i686-pc-linux-gnu"
CFLAGS="-O2 -mcpu=i686 -pipe"
CXXFLAGS="-O2 -mcpu=i686 -pipe"
MAKEOPTS="-j2"
Reading specs from /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i686-pc-linux-gnu/2.95.3/specs
gcc version 2.95.3 20010315 (release)
GNU ld version 2.13.90.0.18 20030121
I also found that when starting XFree86 as root it corrupts my ~/.viminfo file with data, not 100% sure if it's because of the 
crahs but will check it out. nothing in logs.
not sure what else I can tell you so please ask if you need more information.
