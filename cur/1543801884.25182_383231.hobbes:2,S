PCI express neither needs nor can use AGP.
(and to be honest, AGP is one of those things that is best compiled into
the kernel if you need it. AGP deals with system/memory resources, and
some bioses fuck that up. If agp is built in, it'll be fixed in time.
There have been a series of bugs about it against fedora, until it we
made it compiled in .. and poof.. bugs gone)
