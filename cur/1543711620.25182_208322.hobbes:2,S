That's fine -- I wasn't suggesting nopage() should return a PFN.
I was suggesting that if someone wants to map something they're given by
dma_alloc_coherent() into memory, they should be given a PFN to deal
with -- _not_ a "struct page". Therefore, you can't use nopage() for
mapping dma_coherent memory into userspace.
Basically, we should consider the stuff returned by dma_alloc_coherent
to be 'non-RAM' in the context of your previous statement:
	'If a driver wants to map non-RAM pages, that's perfectly ok,
	but it MUST NOT happen through "nopage()".'
There are machines where you _cannot_ sensibly use host memory for
dma_coherent() allocations, but on which there _is_ a few megabytes of
SRAM hanging off the PCI bus which was put there specifically for that
purpose. So dma_alloc_coherent() returns something for which there is
not a valid 'struct page'.
