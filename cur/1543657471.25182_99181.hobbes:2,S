hi,
I'd appreciate any advice on how one would go about analysing a core 
dump of a crashed machine, eg as obtained via netdump.
I'm trying to pin down some kind of timing problem with a driver,
which i've determined from NMI handler forced Oops() is getting stuck
spinning in its interrupt handler. However, i'd like to try see if i 
can pull any information about its state from the core dump.
gdb doesnt seem happy with the stack (kernel is compiled without frame 
pointers, no?), 'bt' and 'frame' commands dont really do anything 
useful.
so any advice / pointers to good docs on how to analyse a netdump 
would be much appreciated.
thanks,
