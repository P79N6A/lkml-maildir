Hello Artemio,
SMP kernel doesn't run "faster" than a UP one, as such, but enabling SMP
support will allow you to make use of your 3 extra CPUs, e.g. by multiple
user applications at the same time, or by various tasks performed inside
the kernel. So, if you have more than one CPU definitely enable SMP
support, unless this causes your system to hang (in which case it's a bug
and you are expected to send a bugfix to this list)
Regards
Tigran
