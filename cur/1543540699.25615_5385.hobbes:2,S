Hi Sandy,
Thanks for bringing the discussion back on topic.  You may want to
observe that the patch formerly known as the International Kernel
Patch (kerneli patch) is now archived on kernel.org as well as on
kerneli.org.  This, we hope, is an early step toward integration into
the mainstream kernel.  This will almost certainly *not* happen for
2.4.0, but may very well happen in 2.4.x for x > 0, and should
definitely happen in 2.5.
You probably want to get the kerneli patch and make your cryptographic
interfaces match as well as possible.  Note that the kerneli patch is
of Norwegian origin -- the maintainer is Alexander Kjeldaas
<astor@fast.no> -- and so you can completely bypass the U.S. if you
want to make sure.  Eliminating duplication probably centers around
creating a common in-kernel cryptographic API, and making everything
relevant (FreeS/WAN, kerneli, and random) use it.
Most likely, there will be no overlap between kernel and user space
cryptography, except perhaps in the support of hardware devices.
Software cryptography is almost certainly better done in user space
completely.
