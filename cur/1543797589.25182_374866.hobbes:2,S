Is there something equivalent on i386 or this is just an x86_64 thing?
Over the past few days I have seen temporary "lockups" of my machine
(athlon X2 running -2.6.14-rt22, PREEMPT_RT, no hi res timers) lasting
for, say between 10 and 30 seconds. This happens maybe one to three
times in a day (that I noticed). The symptom is that the mouse moves but
everything else is just not doing anything. I don't see anything in the
logs or dmesg after the freeze, or on the servers that machine depends
on (through nfs). During one of those lockups a system load monitor in
the gnome panel was visible and it looked like there was a 100% system
load (or close) in one of the cpus.
