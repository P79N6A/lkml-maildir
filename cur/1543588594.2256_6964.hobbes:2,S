Sorry, life has been a little turbulent for me over the last couple of
months.

Well, it's a consequence of using a knife to drive in a nail. :)
Neither CCP nor the Linux CCP implementation are really designed to
support encryption.  There is a fairly strong assumption that if
things go pear-shaped you can always take CCP down and send stuff
uncompressed - it will be slower but it will still work.

Sure, we can fix the problem you've pointed out, but that won't make
for a secure MPPE implementation.  (Is that an oxymoron, actually?)
What I am saying is that even with your fix there is still a lot more
work to do if you want to make sure that you never send or accept
unencypted PPP frames.

Good point.

Yep, with the exception that I wouldn't clear SC_CCP_UP, since that is
set and cleared by pppd.
Here is an updated patch.
Paul.
