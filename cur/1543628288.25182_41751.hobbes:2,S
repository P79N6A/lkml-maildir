This is easily doable as a trigger.  I'm pretty sure that all you want
is
	cat > BitKeeper/triggers/pre-incoming.diffs
	#!/bin/sh
	bk prs -hr+ -nd:KEY: ChangeSet > BitKeeper/log/save_key
	^D
	cat > BitKeeper/triggers/post-incoming.diffs
	#!/bin/sh
	
	i=0
	while test -f BitKeeper/tmp/diffs-$i
	do	i=`expr $i + 1`
	done
	bk diffs -C`cat BitKeeper/log/save_key` > BitKeeper/tmp/diffs-$i
	^D
	chmod +x BitKeeper/triggers/*incoming.diffs
The only reason I don't do this on bkbits.net is that regular style patches
eat a lot more bandwidth than BK patches and we can't afford to offer up
the bandwidth for free.
