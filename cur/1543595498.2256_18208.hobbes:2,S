Greetings, and thanks for this.  If I recall, there is some facility
for this in the tulip cards too, no?  Can one get any benefit with
100Mbps, or is the copy too fast anyway?  Is the source code for Tux
available somewhere?  This is probably the best bet.  It seems as
though the source for X15 is not available.  Any pointers
appreciated.  I'm investigating implementing something like this for
the lam MPI libs.
Take care,
