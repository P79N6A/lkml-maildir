Kernel flaws aren't something we can address (reliably and in general)
via a kernel mechanism.  Versus a threat that can be addressed by kernel
mechanism, like providing complete mediation and unambiguous access
control.  There is a difference.  And we aren't ignoring the kernel
correctness problem - there is separate work in that space, but it
requires separate mechanism outside of SELinux itself.

Part of the discussion has been whether those users' needs could be
solved better via SELinux, whether via improved userspace tools (ala
seedit possibly with an enhanced restorecond) or via extended kernel
mechanism (ala named type transitions and some kind of inheritance
model).  It does however seem like there is a fundamental conflict there
on renaming behavior; I do not believe that file protections should
automatically change in the kernel upon rename and should require
explicit userspace action.  The question though is whether that renaming
behavior in AA is truly a user requirement or a manufactured (i.e.
made-up) one, and whether it is truly a runtime requirement or just a
policy creation time one (the latter being adequately addressed by
userspace relabeling).
If that behavior is truly needed (a point I wouldn't concede), then the
discussion does reduce down to the right implementation method.  There
it appears that the primary objection is to regenerating full pathname
strings and matching them versus some kind of incremental matching
either during lookup itself or via a reverse match as suggested.  That
discussion is principally one in which the vfs folks should be engaged,
not me.

Yes.  Or simply "controls file accesses and capability usage".
