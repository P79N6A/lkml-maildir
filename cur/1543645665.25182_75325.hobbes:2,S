Any large 32 bit box with significant numbers of processes will need 
it to cope with the bloat that rmap introduced - this has nothing to
do with NUMA (some apps may be saved by large pages, some not). 
Avoiding hangs from ZONE_NORMAL oom is not an "optimisation", and I 
doubt optimisations involving major VM changes would be very welcome
after the freeze. This is something we need to get working ASAP ...
