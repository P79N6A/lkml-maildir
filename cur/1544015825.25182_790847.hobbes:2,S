Git helped a bit, I must admit. The 64-bit version does not include
TRACE_IRQS_ON/TRACE_IRQS_OFF in the nmi handler. The comment above
"ENTRY(paranoid_exit)" in entry_64.S should be updated, though. That
code is not used for NMIs.
The revert is obviously the correct thing to do, but a comment would
not hurt here either.
