Hi!
Note: I'm reporting this with a different subject line now,
as I got zero replies to my first bugreport. This is still
the same Asus AP1700-S5 server as in my previous reports,
though:
Asus AP1700-S5 server, single Xeon 2.4GHz CPU (FSB533)
512MB registered DDR with ECC, Asus PR-DLS533 motherboard
with ServerWorks GCLE chipset

I just had another freeze or lockup of this system,
after 1 day and 14 hours uptime. :-(
This time the machine was running with an 3Com 3c905c
100MBit NIC, with the onboard e1000 GBit controllers disabled.
Obviously, this didn't help, too...
When I noticed the freeze, I tried to ping the server,
and got a few replies back, but with a delay of more than
60 seconds! I didn't wait that long when I tried to ping
the server on the previous lockups, so maybe the "no answer
to ping" symptom I described is more a "big delay in
answering ping packets" symptom. Does that ring any bell?
Any idea anyone?
