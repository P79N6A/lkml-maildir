You can't do it that way. It needs to be arch-specific. When using 
something like monitor/mwait (or a "futex", which something like UML might 
use), you need to load the value you want to wait on _before_. So the 
interface literally would have to be the monitor/mwait interface:
	for (;;) {
		lockval = monitor(lock);
		if (!is_locked(lockval))
			break;
		mwait(lock, lockval);
	}
and the fact is, this is all much better just done in the arch-specific 
spinlock code.
