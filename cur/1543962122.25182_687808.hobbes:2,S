Good, thanks for reporting and testing.

I could look into keeping those messages down to only a single one per 
attempt to fetch the so-called configuration ROM of an added node.

The config ROM is an area in the IEEE 1394 address space of a node which 
contains information about the device functions.  It consists of a 
header, a root directory, and subdirectories.  Each one of those has 
CRCs as one safeguard (among others) against integrity issues with the 
data read from the ROM.
A few devices, especially older ones, got the CRC algorithm wrong. Hence 
we don't reject those devices, we only warn about them as a starting 
point for further diagnosis in case that more than this goes wrong when 
using the device.
(The ROM CRC error warning has been added in 2.6.22.  Before Linux 
2.6.22, the ROM CRC errors were silently accepted.  The new alternative 
firewire drivers also do not warn about ROM CRC errors... yet...)
