What you are suggesting can only result in illegal binary-only
modules.
If you override netif_rx(), you are by definition implementing a derived
work of the kernel reimplementing core functionality, thus your binary
only driver is not abiding by the GPL and you are on very shaky legal
ground.
It isn't exported for a reason, there is legitimate use of it from
modules.
