Subject: Linux 2.2.12 merges into 2.3.x
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I've merged most of the 2.2.11/12 changes into my 2.2.14pre1 tree.
The stuff I'm not going to try and merge is:
	Non x86 ports
	Net/ipv4 and Net/ipv6
	ISDN
	drivers/video
	Drivers with obvious active maintainers (eg NCR53c8xx scsi)
So if your work is in that area its between you and the relevant maintainers
to sort out. Otherwise drivers and stuff will start to be pushed into 2.3.x
as I can test them (if possible) or if they look ok (if not). Please check
your drivers work on 2.3.x as they appear in that tree.
If you don't want me pushing your stuff into 2.3.x and its in 2.2.11/12 drop
me a note.
