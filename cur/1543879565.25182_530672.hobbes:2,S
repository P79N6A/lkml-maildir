I used to put everything in a tmpfs on /, and that certainly works. But
most files in a typical image are rarely used and it's a pity to have
lots of little files taking up a 4k page each.
You get pretty big savings by compressing the system into a squashfs and
mounting that, so the question becomes: where to put the squashfs?
ramdisk or loopback mount it from tmpfs/ramfs?
iirc, the problems with loopback have to do with writeout, which isn't a
problem here since squashfs is readonly.
