Sorry, this is probably not a kernel bug.
My test case was slightly different for the first and second run which
is why I got varying results.  I can reproduce the crash now with _all_
recent 2.6 kernels so the bug is likely somewhere else.  The JVM crashes
at different locations depending on the kernel version which is why I
thought the problem was in the kernel in the first place.
Thanks a lot for the help and sorry for the noise.
