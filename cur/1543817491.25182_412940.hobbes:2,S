Even excluding the case that many computers are more or less unique 
combinations of half a dozen different components, everyone will use 
different settings for most hardware-independent things like e.g. file 
systems, preemption or networking options. Even if I had the same 
hardware as you have, my config settings would therefore most likely be 
completely different from yours.

The help texts for the config options should be enough for an 
experienced system administrator to set the right options.
If you know about help texts that could be improved, patches to improve 
them are welcome.
