I agree, the average desktop user isn't even aware of the issues.  But I
think the photographer would like it if the mp3 player can't remove files
in ~/photos/ when it plays a malicious .mp3 file.  So even the desktop
user could benefit from better security infrastructure.  But your point
on security uptake is well-taken.
