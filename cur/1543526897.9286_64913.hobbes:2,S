Almost certainly not related.. There are no known mis-compile bugs that
should matter (that isn't to say that there couldn't be unknown bugs, but
I don't think we're dismissing bugreports due to any compilers).

Looks ok, the suspicious part is actually:

No low-level drivers.
I think "s->cb_config" is probably NULL in read_cb_mem, and you should
probably add a line like
	if (!s->cb_config)
		return;
to the top of read_cb_mem() in cardbus.c..
Also, to get things to work you need to load one of the low-level drivers,
ie "yenta+pci_socket" (cardbus) or "i82365" (classic ISA PCMCIA) or "tcic"
(databook PCMCIA).
