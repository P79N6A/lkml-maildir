I cannot reproduce the BUG with your ml.bz2 patch applied.
I am seeing this with both 2.6.21-rc4-mm1 + hotfixes, and with
2.6.21-rc4 + ml.bz2:
Mar 22 09:10:35 FractalPath kernel: ACPI: CPU0 (power states: C1[C1]
C2[C2] C3[C3])
Mar 22 09:10:35 FractalPath kernel: The kobject at, or inside
per_cpu__cpuidle_devices+0x40/0x558 is not dynamically allocated.
Mar 22 09:10:35 FractalPath kernel: The kobject at, or inside
per_cpu__cpuidle_devices+0xd4/0x558 is not dynamically allocated.
Mar 22 09:10:35 FractalPath kernel: The kobject at, or inside
per_cpu__cpuidle_devices+0x168/0x558 is not dynamically allocated.
Mar 22 09:10:35 FractalPath kernel: cpuidle: using driver acpi_idle
Not sure if this is a problem.  Also, the first time I booted the ml.bz2
build, it hung.  I don't have netconsole or a serial debugging system
set up, so I have no idea what the problem was.  The second boot,
ipw2200 loaded with no errors, but NetworkManager wouldn't
connect until I removed and reinserted the module.
All the best,
           Miles
