Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/10/6/212

Symptoms are identical to those reported on Bugzilla Bug #1025
Kernel: lastest from ppc.bkbits.net/linuxppc-2.5 
(10/06/03 AM)
Single keypress produces > 2 repeated characters. Can't even login to
the system, as i cannot enter my uid. 
Last successful kernel was from this changeset:
ChangeSet@1.1065, 2003-09-26 22:33:42+10:00, paulus@samba.org
Everything since then either doesn't complie, or has the keyboard problem
Further information on request.
