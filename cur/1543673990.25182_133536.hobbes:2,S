Ok.. thanks for the quick reply .. I just booted the kernel and noticed
that the console got stuck (but the it booted fine except from that).
Though I find this weird:
The last thing I saw on the console was the detection of hdb and it's
partitions.... I tried unplugging hdb and it booted just fine... 
coinsidence?
And by the way.... the framebuffer flickers (is that the right word?)
for me.... It looks like an old TV... (Has done with all the (2.5)
kernels I've tried).. Is this a known problem and if so is there a
solution?
I'm using a TFT monitor and this is my append-line..
append="video=i810fb:xres:1280,yres:1024,bpp:16,hsync1:30,hsync2:82, \
		vsync1:50,vsync2:75,accel"
(... if it matters.)
