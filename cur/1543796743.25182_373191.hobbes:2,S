The problem with this statement is that Linux users are a drop in the 
bucket of sales for this hardware.  Boycotting doesn't cost the vendors 
enough to make them care.  And this does nothing for people who are 
converting over to Linux, and didn't buy hardware with that 
consideration in mind.
The only way to break the stalemate is to reverse engineer drivers. 
Turning the screws tighter isn't going to make open drivers magically 
appear.  More likely, the vendors will abandon Linux as being too 
hostile and/or too costly to support, leaving everybody back at square one.
