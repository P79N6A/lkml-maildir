Subject: [PATCH] Additional patch for toplevel Makefile driver lists
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2000/3/19/30

Some shells (bash 2.x specifically) don't like environment variables
with dashes in them.  This patch makes them not exported.  This problem
doesn't show up in the other makefiles because they do not export all
their variables to the environment like the toplevel Makefile does. 
This is also the root of the problem with xargs.
Linus, this is a resend of the patch to you.  I'm not certain it made it
to you the first time.
