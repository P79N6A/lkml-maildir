Narrowed it down to 100% reproducible case:
	chown -Rc 0:<n> .
in a top directory of tree containing ~21938 files
on reiser3 partition:
	/dev/sdc3 on /.3 type reiserfs (rw,noatime)
causes oom kill storm. "ls -lR", "find ." etc work fine.
I suspected that it is a leak in winbindd libnss module,
but chown does not seem to grow larger in top, and also
running it under softlimit -m 400000 still causes oom kills
while chown's RSS stays below 4MB.
