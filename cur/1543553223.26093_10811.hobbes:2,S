Interpolating from those load figures, you'll probably have
to wait for 5 to 10 more hours ;)
It looks like you were testing the machine /very/ close to
the thrashing point and the garbage collection afterwards
pushed it right over the edge.
One possible solution to speed things up would be to send
-SIGSTOP to 90% of the oracle processes and wake them up
again slowly later on...  (this is basically what thrashing
control in an OS does, suspend processes and wake them up
again later)
regards,
Rik
