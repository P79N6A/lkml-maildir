Not using LDT's on 2.4 kernel other than RHEL3's means to have a
different ABI.  This is the /lib/libpthread.so.0 RH is shipping which
simply cannot be used in some/many situations since there is no
"thread register".  This means the programmer is not able to select
size and/or location of the stacks.  Interfaces like
pthread_attr_setstack() simply won't work at all.
So, do't confuse people with "does anyone have comparison information
w/threads using
LDT's and without (performance, protection, etc)?".  That's comparing
apples and oranges.
