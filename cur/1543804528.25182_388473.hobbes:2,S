What's the point of using a UUID here?

A comment that describes what pfmfs is for would be useful here, and
perhaps a warning to hold one's nose, if the code that follows is
anything to go by :-)

Why a dead interrupt handler here?

Why are you using sysctls, and not sysfs?  Why is this in a file that
claims to be procfs-related?
Also, it looks like much of the procfs goo is actually not related to
individual processes, really doesn't belong in /proc at all, and should
move to some place in sysfs somewhere.

Yep, this shouldn't be in /proc, unless I'm massively misunderstanding
the current state of the world.

That should be void __user *uaddr.  Please run the code through sparse.

kfree ignores a NULL argument.
