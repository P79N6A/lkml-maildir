tried that - worked well during the weekend (low io-traffic).
but today it broke again:
hda: dma_timer_expiry: dma status == 0x61
hda: error waiting for DMA
hda: dma timeout retry: status=0xd0 { Busy }
hda: DMA disabled
hdb: DMA disabled
ide0: reset: success
blk: queue c034db40, I/O limit 4095Mb (mask 0xffffffff)
more ideas to fix this ?
thanks
Stefan
