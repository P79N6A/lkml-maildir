Would you have time to comment on the approach I have taken to
implement a standard asynchronous memcpy interface?  It seems it would
be a good complement to what you are proposing.  The entity that
describes the aio operation could take advantage of asynchronous
engines to carry out copies or other transforms (maybe an acrypto tie
in as well).
Here is the posting for 2.6.19.  There has since been updates for
2.6.20, but the overall approach remains the same.
