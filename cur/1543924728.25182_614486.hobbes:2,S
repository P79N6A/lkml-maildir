Subject: the value in exporting unused header files?

  as part of the output of yet another cleanup script i have, we
notice that:
$ grep -r if_wanpipe *
Documentation/networking/wan-router.txt:        if_wanpipe.h    WANPIPE Socket definitions
include/linux/Kbuild:unifdef-y += if_wanpipe.h
include/linux/if_wanpipe.h:* if_wanpipe.h       Header file for the Sangoma AF_WANPIPE Socket
$
  in other words, a header file that is not included by any other file
in the tree is still being exported to user space.  is that normal?
