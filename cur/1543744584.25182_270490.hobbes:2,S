OK. Occasional page allocation failures are not a problem, although
if it is an order-0 allocation it may be an idea to increase
min_free_kbytes a bit more.
I think you said earlier that you had min_free_kbytes set to 8192?
Well after applying my patch, the memory watermarks get squashed
down, so you'd want to set it to at least 16384 afterward. Maybe
more.
That shouldn't cause it to actually keep more memory free than
2.6.8 did with an 8192 setting.
