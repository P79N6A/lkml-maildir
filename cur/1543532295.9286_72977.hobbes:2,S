Now that I found the doc I was looking for (thanx everyone -- again,
JUST SHOOT ME because I looked there and missed it before!), how
would this "max fs cache" parameter differ from what is or has been
reserved for in the docs:

Isn't that what "max_percent" is [reserved] for?
Again, newbie action here so SMACK ME (hard) if I'm missing the
point.  I'm no VM expert (sad since I had an OS course in college
based on Tannebaum's book).  ;->>>

P.S.  Thanx for everyone's help.  I have something to work with
