How do you think this should help?  If you make all the threads
siblings (of the initial thread), how should terminating one of them
effect the others?  If one threads dies of a SEGFAULT all the others
must, too.  Being siblings, they just continue to run.  In the case of
a normal multi-threaded application the parent will be the shell (or
whatever program started the MT program).  This program does not go on
a reap the children.
