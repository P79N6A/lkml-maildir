OK, I have merged the monolithic patch into jgarzik/netdev-2.6.git#atl1. 
  Once I'm done merging patches tonight, I will merge this new 'atl1' 
branch into the 'ALL' meta-branch, which will auto-propagate this driver 
into Andrew Morton's -mm for testing.
For future driver updates, please send a patch rather than the full 
driver diff.
If it looks good, we will push for 2.6.21 (or 2.6.22, if updates or 
objections continue to come fast and furious).  It's in "the system" 
now, thanks for all your hard work!
	Jeff
