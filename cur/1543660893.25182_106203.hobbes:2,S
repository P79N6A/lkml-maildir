I agree it is a lot simpler; however, you have to give up the ability to
install and upgrade system software seamlessly. When Debian reports a
security issue, all I do is apt-get -u upgrade and skim through it - all
boxes are magically updated. No need to update the individual /etc files
for the changes, and no messy links either.
It does require you take care, though. The most important issue is
finding out what files are written to in these directories (in violation
of the LFS/FHS, I must say). The current culprit I am after is a
/sbin/init, who writes to /etc/ioctl.save (why, I wonder). After a lot
of cleanup, I've managed to pair this down to teh minimum, and I'm going
after some of the last culprits now.

It seems Trond has given us the answer to the problem: the persistence
of /var/lib/nfs seems to be essential to a healthy diskless client. One
of our co-workers who was an expert as triggering the problems is at the
beach this week, so I can't tell for sure, but next Tuesday or so I hope
to post to NFS-list with [SUMMARY] in the Subject line <wink>
Take care,
