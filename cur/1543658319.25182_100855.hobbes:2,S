That's the easy part.  :)  You then get to take a cross-product of that and
its interactions with whatever combination of RFC/I-D/ad-crockery are in
the 4 different Solaris releases, the 2 or 3 AIX releases, the Tru64 releases,
the myriad different Microsoft-based servers - and that's just the 10K square
feet in our machine room.  A lot of our gear keeps trying to talk to the
outside world, where ALL bets are off. ;)
Does anybody think it would be worthwhile to collate a document of which
RFCs/I-Ds are supported, and to what extent (the MUST/SHOULD/MAY stuff)?
Or is there one already and my 3:30AM search for same is missing it? ;)
