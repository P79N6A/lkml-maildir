I actually use no encryption yet, as I still have to find out time
 to call D-Link about the fact that my router hangs when I try
 to set up a whitelist of MAC addresses for the wireless AP;
 WPA would be up next...
Would loading the module with h/w encryption turned on
 make any difference in my case ?
