In 2.3.32-pre, I see that the PageDMA(page) macro has been changed to
#define PageDMA(page)            (contig_page_data.node_zones + ZONE_DMA == (page)->zone)
Why was this done? I would still prefer to see the PG_DMA bit, because
for discontig platforms, there is not a "contig_page_data". In short, 
this will break any platform that does use the CONFIG_DISCONTIGMEM code.
Thanks.
