We did something similar where arbitrary processes can register to be 
sent an arbitrary signal when the state of other processes change.  The 
caller passes in the pid, the signal to be sent, and an event mask 
describing which events you're interested in (stop/start/exit/kill/etc.).
A signal number of 0 means to deregister interest in the specified pid.
