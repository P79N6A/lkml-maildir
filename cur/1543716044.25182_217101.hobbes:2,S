I'm thinking that the problem is that the page cache is greedier that
most people expect.  For example, if I could hold the page cache to be
under a specific size, then I could do some performance measurements.
E.g, compile kernel with a 768K page cache, 512K, 256K and 128K.  On a
machine with loads of RAM, where's the optimal page cache size?
