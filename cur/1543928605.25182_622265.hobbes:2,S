Well we've got at least two ARM boards which need the additional unmask
to work correctly with interrupt threading .. So there must be at least
two ARM boards using handle_simple_irq incorrectly .. It sounds like you
would prefer we send patches to move those handle_simple_irq users into
another method ?
