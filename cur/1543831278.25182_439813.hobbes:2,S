There is no barrier implementation on SCSI (basically you can't maintain
barriers in the face of TCQ, so only depth one devices can do it and
hence all the scsi drivers turn it off), so it must be a FLUSH CACHE.
This one looks like it went down via prepare_flush rather than
issue_flush, so the normal error printing case that issue flush has is
skipped.  This patch should tell us what the error was on the command.
