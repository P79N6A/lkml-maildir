Even better would be a 30-40 patch train for PaX, a 10-15 patch train
for the other randomization stuff in grsecurity (pid, port number, all
the rest of those), a 50-60 patch train for the RBAC stuff, and so on.
Keep in mind that properly segmented, *parts* of grsecurity have at least
a fighting chance - the fact that (for instance) mainline may reject the
way RBAC is implemented because it's not LSM-based doesn't mean that you
shouldn't at least try to get the PaX stuff in, and the randomization stuff,
and so on.
