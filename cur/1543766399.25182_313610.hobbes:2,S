Subject: [patch 5/7] uml - hostfs: avoid buffers
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Paolo 'Blaisorblade' Giarrusso <blaisorblade@yahoo.it>
Use this:
	.set_page_dirty = __set_page_dirty_nobuffers,
We already dropped the inclusion of <linux/buffer_head.h>, and we don't have
a backing block device for this FS.
"Without having looked at it, I'm sure that hostfs does not use
buffer_heads.  So setting your ->set_page_dirty a_op to point at
__set_page_dirty_nobuffers() is a reasonable thing to do - it'll provide a
slight speedup."
This speedup is one less spinlock held and one less conditional branch, which
isn't bad.
