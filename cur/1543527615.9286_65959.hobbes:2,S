And if there is anything that documents this, is there anything that
documents the other changes between block device drivers in 2.2 and 2.3?
For example the gendisk structure, the file_operations becoming
block_device_operations, xx_init() now seems to call xx_geninit() rather
than being part of the gendisk structure, register_blkdev() becoming
devfs_register_blkdev(), and these calls to register_disk()...

Hi, folks
Just wondering ... I noticed that between 2.2 and 2.3, RO_IOCTLS macro
disappeared.  I was just browsing through the codes that used to call upon
RO_IOCTLS, and noticed that there has been some changes.  From what I can
gather RO_IOCTLS has been replaced by blk_ioctl in drivers/block/blkpg.c
Is there a documentation that documents this change?  I noticed in
2.3.48-pre2, two drivers still call RO_IOCTLS (rd.c and fd1772.c), it's no
big deal for me to replace those lines (since it's really simple too), but
just wanted to know the reason for the change ...
Thanks
Andrew Park
