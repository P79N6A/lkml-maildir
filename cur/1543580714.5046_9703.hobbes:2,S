I had the same problem when upgrading from 2.4.0-test10 to 2.4.0,
altough my keyboard worked for about half a year without problems. 
But, what a coincidence, it turned out to be a hardware problem. Two pins
of the PS/2 connector were moved inside the connector, thus they didn't
connect to the keyboard controller. I replaced the keyboard cable and
all is well. Did you try to replace the keyboard ?
