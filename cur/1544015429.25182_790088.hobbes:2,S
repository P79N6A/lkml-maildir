Ah OK, that sounds all right.  I was reacting to the "broken
userspace" in the patch description which at first glance seemed to be
saying that userspace (i.e. pppd :) is doing something which has
recently been declared to be wrong and therefore it is "broken".
I think "fix broken userspace" as a patch headline is quite
ambiguous.  Something like "Fix bug in conversion to use IDR" would be
more informative.
Paul.
