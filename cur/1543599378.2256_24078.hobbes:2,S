Wrong.  A cast throws away information, making meaningful warnings impossible.
The assignment allows the compiler to apply the usual C integral
promotions and catch narrowing and non-value-preserving conversions,
like unsigned int to int, or an even more common bug, unsigned int to
long, which behaves differently depending on whether long is 32 or 64
bits.
