I have to admit I don't quite understand how drivers/ is organized right now.
There seem to be at least four criteria for subdirectories of drivers/:
drivers/<function> (sound, net)
drivers/<interface> (char, block) (this isn't the same as function IMHO)
drivers/<bus-the-device-is-on> (usb, sbus)
drivers/<architecture> (s390, sgi)
then there are some hybrids (usb seems to be both "devices that are on USB"
and "USB controllers") and strange things like drivers/char/sysrq.c (which
isn't a character device at all, and isn't really a driver either).
I don't see any particular preference, and my impression is that new
directories get added pretty much at random.
I think I'm not the only one to be a bit confused about this.
