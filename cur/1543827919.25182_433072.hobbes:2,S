Others have made this point also.  I can't speak for Jesper,
but I did consider making it generic.  The issue was that 
doing so would add more code, but I don't personally know 
of any real world situation that would use the generic 
solution.  I didn't fancy the thought of arguing on these
lists for code that no one would actually use.
If someone could put up their hand and say "Hey, I need
this," then expanding the patch to accommodate them would
be a pleasure.  I like generic code too.
