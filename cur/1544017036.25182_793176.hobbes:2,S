Well, if you freeze root and do some things that require IO there, you
can get stuck pretty easily
(hacked xfs_io to call the ioctl here)
[root@inode io]# ./xfs_io -r -x -F -c "freeze" /
[root@inode io]# ls
^Z
^C

oh, hrm.  Maybe I didn't think enough about how it's handed off to
pdflush; I could rearrange if that makes sense?  Or maybe handing to
pdflush is wrong, it was just so convenient....

Hm, maybe possible... I'll have to think about that.
