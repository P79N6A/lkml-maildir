I am *not* saying it should have stayed out-of-tree.
I am saying that it was merged too early, and that there are points that 
should have been addressed before the driver got merged.
Get it submitted for review to linux-kernel.
Give the maintainers some time to incorporate all comments.
Even one month later it could still have made it into 2.6.25.
The only problem with my suggestion is that it's currently pretty random 
whether someone takes the time to review such a driver on linux-kernel.
And even if I'm getting fire for this again (and different from newbies 
running checkpatch on the kernel) for driver submissions it actually 
makes sense to tell the submitter to fix the checkpatch errors [1], and 
it would have made the driver better in this case (again, it could still 
have made it into 2.6.25).
People are actually more motivated to fix their code for getting it into 
the kernel than to fix their code after it went into the kernel, so we 
might get better quality when merging a bit later.
