Good point.  I have a very useful shell script called `ft' and users
should have the _choice_ to use it.  But they don't because they don't
know about it.
Please Linus, can you put my `ft' script in the kernel before 2.4?
Sorry, I don't remember what it does.

(I wonder what the Serbs on this list think of that).
If that's what chance and choice mean, then users _do_ have the choice
to install Reiserfs.  Enjoy.
