I think I'll have to send you a patch that changes the notifiers but I
doubt it will fix it.  
After a bit of messing around I have the 2.6.23-mm1 running on my core-2
box  note: Ubuntu's make-kpkg on the mm1 tree resulted in a system that
wouldn't boot past the intrd.  Looks like the pivot root failed or
something.
Anyway, I'm not reproducing your experience, snd_pcm is loaded.  I don't
know none of the WARN's are not hitting on my box.
do you have some configuration information that could help me reproduce
the issue?

well its booting but I'm not reproducing the trace messages.
I'll do the patch for you to test.
