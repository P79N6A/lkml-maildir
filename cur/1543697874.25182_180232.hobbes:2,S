I'll see if I can help.
I suspect that if you add the "no_subtree_check" export option the
problem will go away.  If you could confirm that, and then set it back
to "subtree_check" so we can keep hunting, that would be good.
Next, some better tracing.
The Linux NFS client will never re-try a filehandle that it thinks is
stale, so the tracing you did doesn't actually show any access of the stale
filehandle. 
So you need to have tracing on when the filehandle goes stale.
If you could:
  echo 2 >  /proc/sys/sunrpc/nfsd_debug 
and then try to create a stale file/directory, then the trace produced
by that could well be helpful.
Finally, when you have create a stale filehandle and got a good trace,
could you send it to me and include an
   ls -l
for the bad file/directory and every parent up to the export point.
Thanks,
