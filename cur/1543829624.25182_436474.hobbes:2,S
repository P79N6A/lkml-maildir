Good day,
I am looking for your cooperation in building a Tourist  
Hotel or Real Estate in your country. I am sorry if this is not in 
line  with your business. I need an experienced person like you to 
assist me  to set up, develop the project.
On the resumption of the 
project, you  will be made a Director for the role and the assistance 
you rendered.  You will also be entitled to a percentage agreed upon 
between me (MR  PAUL SIMONS) and you before the commencement of the 
project.
However, I got your email information on your Hotel contact 
list. Your immediate reply will be highly appreciated and I shall give 
you more information on this project. Please contact me at my private 
e-mail address: mr.paulsimons@yahoo.fr or reach me directly on my 
mobile line: +234-80-34667398.
Thanks and God bless.
MR PAUL SIMONS.
