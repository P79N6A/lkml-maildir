OK, I am misunderstanding what a gratuitus arp is supposed to do. I
understood that is was sending an arp RESPONSE for your address not an arp
REQUEST for your address. Sending a request for your address that you will
be responding to will only do some good if you have a machine set to
broadcast all arp responses (there was a comment that some machines not
unicast the arp response) and seems like additional overhead compared to
just sending the one packet.
