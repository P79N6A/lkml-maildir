Could you please try the patch below - it should fix the issues you are
seeing although there may be other devices (really any hot-pluggable
device) that will show the same behaviour. In the long run swsusp should
not attempt resuming devices when the system can not handle the process
properly.

===================================================================
Input: serio - do not attempt to immediately disconnect port if
       resume failed, let kseriod take care of it. Otherwise we
       may attempt to unregister associated input devices which
       will generate hotplug events which are not handled well
       during swsusp.
