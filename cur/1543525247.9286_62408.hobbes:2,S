If you mean that a devfs kernel has entries in different places, then
yes, nearly everything breaks. The old scheme was a mess, and Linus
wanted to take an iron broom to it.
However, if you run devfsd, then you can get back all the old names if
you so desire. In fact, that's what I do on my systems. So
devfs+devfsd shouldn't break anything.
