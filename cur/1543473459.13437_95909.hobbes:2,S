Hi again folks...
	*watches power flicker*
Question is, what to do with tulip.c in 2.2.x? 0.83 does not work
well with PNIC cards (e.g. Linksys LNE 100TX).  What I see is the
card flicking between 10 and 100 modes at something like a fixed inverval,
and I should note that the notes for 0.83 mention PNIC autonegotiation
doesn't work.  LNE100TX's are nice $35 NICs IMHO, Could it happen that
someone (Don Becker?) hammer the fast whatever it is out of 0.83 and the
PNIC and other fixes from later versions into something? Please?

NT servers and NT (Northern Telecom/Bay Networks) hardware...guess who
is winning the stability and uptime race? Er, stability at least, if I
didn't feel the need to compile a kernel only to have a new one out hours
after I compile...*rambles on*... Anyways a big thank you to all Linux
contributors...
