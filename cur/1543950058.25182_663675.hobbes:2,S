Actually, my pedantic streak prefers that to be in a separate patch.
I think the ptrace_reparented cleanup is fine, it is purely cosmetic and
improves readability.

This is changing the test from list_empty(&child->ptrace_list)
to child->parent == child->real_parent.  It should indeed be
impossible for those tests not to match.  But, paranoia is its
own reward.  I don't object to the change, but it should be
separate so bisect distinguishes it should it ever turn out to
matter in some way we are now overlooking.  I'd even be a
little inclined towards:
	if (child->real_parent == child->parent) {
		BUG_ON(!list_empty(&child->ptrace_list));
		return 0;
	} else {
		BUG_ON(list_empty(&child->ptrace_list));
		return 1;
	}
except of course you couldn't use that in the reparent_thread case.
Thanks,
Roland
