Good idea. I think this should go into the Documentation directory.
I would personnaly add :
- "1.4.3 have you described side-effects you're aware of, or incompatibilities
  or breakage of other patches ?"
- "1.5.2. Have you checked that your patch still applies without fuzz on latest
dev kernel ?" (which is not implied nor excused by 1.4.2).
Cheers,
Willy
