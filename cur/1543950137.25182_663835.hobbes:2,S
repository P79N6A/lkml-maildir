Updated, you are absolutely right, thanks.
Will you commit below patch for 2.6.25? I know that, at the time, I have 
seen this scsi-ml-loop in action on a sata drive here in the lab, on an 
x86_64 machine. The current solution will silently corrupt data, which 
is very hard to find.

Subject: [PATCH] blk: missing add of padded bytes to io completion byte count
the commit e97a294ef6938512b655b1abf17656cf2b26f709 was very wrong. This is
because scsi-ml supports the ability to split a request into smaller chunks,
in which case scsi_bufflen() is smaller then request length. Then at completion
time the remainder can be issued as a new scsi command. In that case the above
commit is a data corruption.
Also in this fix all users of block layer are taken care of, and not only
scsi devices.
