Actually, list_for_each_continue_rcu() needs to be removed in favor of
your new list_for_each_entry_continue_rcu().  There are currently only
two users as of 2.6.22.  One of them immediately does a list_entry(),
and the other would convert easily as well.  So please let me know
when this gets accepted!  ;-)
						Thanx, Paul
