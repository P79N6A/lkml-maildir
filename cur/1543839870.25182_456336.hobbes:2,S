pfn_to_nid() is used at runtime and the early_node_map[] is deleted by 
then. As this step, I only want to get the initialisation correct. What 
can be replaced is the architecture-specific early_pfn_to_nid() function 
which I did for power and x86.

To implement a common one of interest, the array would have to be 
converted to a linked list at the end of boot so it could be modified by 
memory hot-add, then pfn_to_nid() would walk the linked list rather than 
the existing array. pfn_valid() would probably be replaced as well. 
However, this is going to be slower (if more accurate in some cases) than 
the existing pfn_valid() and so I would treat it as a separate issue.

Not at this time. I want to make sure the memory initialisation is right 
before dealing with additional complications.
