If done right (and autosuspend now is), there is no "required" userspace.
If you want autosuspend, you just say so. The kernel doesn't do it by 
default. This is not about "user space required" - it's about "user space 
can ask for it if it wants to".
Notice? There doesn't even have to be any blacklists/whitelists at all. It 
really can be just an application that allows the user to check or uncheck 
the capability (with a warning saying something like: "Some USB devices 
may disconnect when suspended - if this affects you, uncheck this").
That's why the kernel shouldn't set policy. It's a *good* thing to just 
expose the capabilities, but not necessarily use them!
