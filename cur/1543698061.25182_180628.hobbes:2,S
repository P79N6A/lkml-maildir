The only problem is that your BIOS will probably not be able to boot
from it, so unless you use some kind of free bios implementation or even
some kind of free OF or something such, you will never be able to boot
from these drives.
For non booting drives, nothing stops you from using alternate partition
tables, the Mac OS on as well as the Amiga partition tables seems nice
to me (maybe others too, but i mostly know these two of the alternative
partition tables) as these are simply linked list of partition entries,
you can have as many as you want (limit to 128 partitions for amiga
partition in the libparted implementation i made for example).
