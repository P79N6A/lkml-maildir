We're going trough two similar problems here. One is KDE, and the other
is Linuxconf. Linuxconf is core dumping on a module when it is linked
with pthread and dlopen()'ed with RTLD_GLOBAL. We must reduce one of
them to a testcase.
Btw, both are mainly C++ programs. Is your software written in C++?

We'll probably do this here...

Please, let me know as well! :-)
Thanks!!
