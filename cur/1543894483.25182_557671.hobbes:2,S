it's also derived from the non-GPLed bits as well.
so if it were a derived work in a legal sense (nessasary for your

licenses.

you keep claiming this, but other people claim you are wrong. what good do 
your claims do (why are your claims about what's in the spirit of the 
license and what's not any more valid than anyone else's?)
