At the most recent Ottata Linux Symposium, there was a PowerPC
session with about 20 people. Somebody did a poll, asking what
people used. I was the only person who dared to use a kernel
from Linus. Everone else was using the BenH and BitKeeper ones.
This is a sorry state of affairs. If people are off using kernels
from other places, there isn't a great incentive to keep the
official Linus kernel updated. Nobody uses it anyway.
Elimination of these non-Linus PowerPC trees would be great.
(at least the "stable" ones should go, as they lure people
away from the one true source tree)
