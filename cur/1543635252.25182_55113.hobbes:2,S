In the kernel source fs/ntfs/layout.h is a header file describing the full 
on disk layout of NTFS (except journalling and encryption).
We have html documentation about ntfs on our linux-ntfs website (note if 
you see conflicting information between the documentation and layout.h 
always take layout.h to be correct, there still some discrepancies which we 
need to iron out...). You can go directly to the documentation by going to 
this url:
         
http://linux-ntfs.sf.net/ntfs/
Our user space library and tools can also be helpful, especially I have 
written some documents and placed them in the linux-ntfs/doc directory. You 
can just download linux-ntfs 1.6.0 and read the documentation there. But 
the code in 1.6.0 is very out of date. The library has been pretty much 
completely rewritten, massively cleaned up, and the functionality has been 
extended. You can get all the goodies from cvs. For instructions see here:

Best regards,
