I only turned the nmi watchdog on, on the one "unknown" version Oops.
This box was running fine with 2.4.18-SuSE with uptimes 40+days. _Now_
I am almost sure, that it's _not_ a hardware problem (FENCE counting
here as software - since there is a software workaround).
I had 3 lockups in 2 days, when I switched to 2.4.19 - and even lower
room temperature. No, there _must_ be a bug :)
With the relocation you are right - I thought it would test against 
NULL :-(
I think that the tasklist is broken inbetween - either due to broken
readlocks (no working EFENCE on PPRO)
Can someone explain me the difference for label 1 and 2?
Why is the "js 2f" there? This I don't understand fully -
it looks broken to me.
include/asm-i386/rwlock.h
#define __build_read_lock_ptr(rw, helper)   \
     asm volatile(LOCK "subl $1,(%0)\n\t" \
              "js 2f\n" \
              "1:\n" \
              LOCK_SECTION_START("") \
              "2:\tcall " helper "\n\t" \
              "jmp 1b\n" \
              LOCK_SECTION_END \
              ::"a" (rw) : "memory")
