1) Why shouldn't the low-latency patches work for another architecture?
Andrew Morton might be interested to fix other architectures too.
(but most patches are not in architecture specific code)
2) Montavistas reschedulable kernel is a very interesting approach, newly
released an update by Robert Love
  
http://kpreempt.sourceforge.net/
  
http://tech9.net/rml/linux/patch-rml-2.4.10-pre2-preempt-kernel-1
(there are still some spikes, but the floor is smooth)
But note you with both approaches you want to run the latency critical process
with a higher priority, and probably with the memory locked down.
See example code (latencytest) at:
 
http://www.gardena.net/benno/linux/audio/
(but there is no need to run at the maximum possible priority since your
 process will be alone anyway...)
