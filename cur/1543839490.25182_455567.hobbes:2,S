Unlike other rights management systems you are allowed to circumvent or
remove the EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL mechanism.  The GPL lets you.
It is still a rights management system, even if it isn't
forced upon the users.
Now, if someone actually distributes a closed-source module that
circumvents EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL, or relies on an accompagnying
open source patch that removes the mechanism, this happens:
1. By doing this, they clearly showed that their module is outside the
   gray area of "allowed binary-only modules". They definitively
   made a "derived work" and distributed it.
2. Anybody who received this module may now invoke the GPL
   (and the force of law, if necessary) to extract the 
   module source code from the maker.  And then this source
   can be freely redistributed to all interested.
The vendor will be powerless to stop this, no amount of "third
party" patents / trade secrets / intellectual property
inside that module source can prevent its opening. The
module vendor broke all of that the moment they distributed
this nasty module, and set themselves up for this.  The vendor
is then the one who have to pay these third parties for 
opening their source.  They must bear the cost of
free licences for all on any third-party copyright.
Any _patented_ stuff may still be covered
of course, making the source less useable.  But the "trade secrets"
broke at the point of distributing a module with the GPL workaround.
So the rights management system works really well - it provides an
enforceable "the price for using these symbols is your code".
Sure, they can patch out the mechanism, but doing so will force them
to hand over the code, and then the module will be trivially rewritten
in a more appropriate way.  I.e. now that it is open, it can
use the GPL symbols without any workaround.
The mechanism itself is not protected by laws like the DMCA, because
its removal is explicitly allowed.  The great thing is, protection
of the _content_ is not lost when this happens.  
The same applies to everything else - before the DMCA, you could
legally break any copy protection scheme.  The content was still
protected by law.  In our case, enforcing it is easier though.
