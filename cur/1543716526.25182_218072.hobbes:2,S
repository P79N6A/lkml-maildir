We've been able to develop a (complex) workaround for the VM layout
problems in userspace by inserting a shim between the dynamic linker and
the kernel. It sets up the address space correctly before the linker
runs so, for now, Wine will be alright without the patch - assuming we
can get the shim merged with Wine CVS of course :)
It would be nice to get the bssprot patch in though, if only because a
GNU linker script would be about 100x smaller and less scary than the
shim code.
thanks -mike
