Hi,
I've put up a modified cd patch set against 2.4.0-test12-pre7. The
changes are roughly as follows:
o Fix SCSI CD-ROM on fs with < 2KB block size. I've briefly tested
  with ext2 (1KB) and msdos (512b) and it appears to work. Would
  the HFS folks try this too?
o Per command timeout for CD-ROM generic packet
o Per command quiet bit, as not to print a lot of sense stuff when
  we know that something may fail
o Major CDROM_SEND_PACKET cleanup
o ide-cd shut up stuff (- sense logging in some cases)
o Make sure that cdrom_sleep actually does that, sleeps
o Let sr retry a PLAYTRKIND command with PLAYMSF for ide-scsi
  and ATAPI.
o Minor sr cleanups

In addition I made another small fix after uploading this one. Audio
ripping can fail with the vm failing to allocate enough contigous
pages, if ripping programs specify large bites of frames to be ripped.
Always default to allocating just a single page.
