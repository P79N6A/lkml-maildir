I should read all my mail before replying. Yes, this is a problem for 
people and I was thinking the same thing that we should get this in now 
and fix the remaining problem later.
One question:
Why do you need conn_complete? Isn't "server->state == CONN_VALID" good
enough?
And are you still working on fixing the remaining "multiple-ls" problem?
(The one where one ls would work and the other return an error).
Or is that fixed in this version?
