I take back what I said, I think the -EINVAL behavior is better
and mmap.c should call into this code to verify the requested
mmap() parameters.

Why do you need the same piece of data mapped to multiple places
in the first place, and why at specific addresses?  It's purely an
optimization of some sort, right?

It doesn't work in just the right set of circumstances, if interrupts
arrive at just the right moment it might flush the bad aliases out
of the cache via displacement during your 'check' phase.
Then during your actual computation you can hit the aliasing problem
silently.
That's just a bad way to do this.

I'd suggest instead to hardcode the SHMLBA stuff into your sources.

Unfortunately, it is anything but robust.

No.
