   That's fine but there are drivers (USB, etc) doing
   	struct something {
   	        int field1;
   	        char dma_buffer[SMALLER_THAN_CACHE_LINE];
   	        int field2;
   	};
   
   	struct something *dev = kmalloc(sizeof *dev, GFP_KERNEL);
   
   Do they have to change to
   
How about allocating struct something using pci_pool?
