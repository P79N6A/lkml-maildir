 Just found out psmouse_noext is deprecated. I have specified
psmouse_proto then, but imps and exps (and bare too, but I have not
tested it, as reading the code it seems psmouse_noext falls back to
bare) are the same. On the console touchpad is working, under XFree86
4.3.0 is not. To be more specific, the buttons do work, but I can not
move the pointer at all. Well, first I thought the middle two buttons
are for scrolling, as they are placed (and IIRC, they do scroll under
m$ win), but the top button is like the left button and the bottom button
is for paste, ie middle button on three buttons mices.
