That's crap, since there _IS_ such a grow.  Again, they easily sit around
for 5-7 minutes without a single attempt to access them, while the system
is swapping like hell.

It's "I hadn't touched that inode in quite a while, but I'll retain it
in-core almost indefinitely".

Again, inodes are in that state only if there is no dentry pointing to
them.  And in _that_ state (== no references from the rest of kernel)
they happily sit around for minutes.

It's always a pity when trivial testing spoils a beautiful theory, isn't it?
