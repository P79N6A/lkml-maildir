Could you please do the following:
1. echo 1 > /sys/modules/i8042/parameters/debug
2. switch away from your linux box
3. wait 5 seconds
4. Switch back to Linux box
5. Move mouse slightly
6. echo 0 > /sys/modules/i8042/parameters/debug
7. Send me dmesg
Also, does the resync fail if you are not using KVM and plug the mouse
directly into the box.
To stop resync attempts do:
	echo -n 0 > /sys/bus/serio/devices/serioX/resync_time
where serioX is serio port asociated with your mouse.
Thanks!
