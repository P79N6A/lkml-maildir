What we want is no directed cycles.  That is A is the parent of B is the
parent of C is the parent of A.  We don't care about A is the parent of
B is the parent of C; A is the parent of B is the parent of C.
OK, here's a random idea that just popped into my head, and to which
I've given little thought (read: none whatsoever), and may be the
stupidest idea ever proposed on LKML, but thought I would just toss it
out to see if it could stimulate someone to come up with something
better (read: sane):  Conceptually, foo/.... is just a symlink to
/meta/[filesystem]/[inode of foo].
And a question: is it feasible to store, for each inode, its parent(s),
instead of just the hard link count?
