Good point, but they can have almost as much fun doing chmod 000
/etc/passwd. :-)
I think you cannot secure your system against being brought down and
important parts deleted. This is what backups are for. The whole purpose
of this flag would be to protect my private data from being read, not to
free me from the obligation to keep backups.
An idea would be to allow setting this flag only on files that are truly
executable in the way that the kernel recognizes them, but...no. :-)
