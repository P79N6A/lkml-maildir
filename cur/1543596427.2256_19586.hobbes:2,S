Leaving copyright messages also saves the purpose of motivating - not all but
many - developers.  People who _see_ the printk copyright messages is a _very_
large superset of people who _look_ at source code, or ChangeLog / CREDITS /
MAINTAINERS files.
After all many copyright messages are not that annoying.
