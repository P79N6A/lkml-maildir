1LL would suit here.  Of a cast to loff_t.

squashfs_block_t and squashfs_inode_t, please.  If one must use typedefs...

Whoa.  Tons of bitfields in this file.  Are these on-disk data structures? 
If so, that's a problem for portability between architectures and possibly
compiler versions.  It also introduces locking complexity.
if they're in-core data structures then the bitfields are probably slower than using `int', as well.

See, if one CUP is modifying `inode_type' while another CPU is modifying
`mode', this struct can get trashed.

hmm, OK..  Tell us more?

Can the standard leXX_to_cpu() helpers not be used here?

Whitespace inconsistency (column 1 for the closing brace is standard)

Your changelog didn't mention that squashfs interacts with the boot
process.  That's the sort of thing which is nice to tell people about.

Lots of little comments, but I have no fundamental problems with the
patches as long as the bitfield issue is shown to be a non-issue.
Please respin the patches and unless someone else sees a showstopper I'll
merge them into -mm for further testing and review, thanks.
