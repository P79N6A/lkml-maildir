Do Andi did the kmalloc too? If so I agree with Linus.
The right thing to do is to increase the double-page reference count in
the struct page to avoid /proc sniffing. So we'll be secure and _fast_.
It's what I am doing now for 2.3.18ac10.
I did not taken the right approch (get_page()) in first place as I thought
it would been rejected (as at 2.2.1 time) so I took the 2.2.12pre14
approch that at least it's not been rejected (as it's in 2.2.13pre14 8)
that's safe from an Oops point of view but not mathematically secure.
