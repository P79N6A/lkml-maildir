Big honking patch. Wholesale removal of old code. Wholesale addition of
new code.
And this is the closest to a hint of what an OCP in the old code:
- * @device: OCP device such as PCI, GPT, UART, OPB, IIC, GPIO, EMAC, ZMII
- * @dev_num: ocp device number whos paddr you want
And in the new:
+extern struct ocp_def core_ocp[];	/* Static list of devices, provided by
+					   CPU core */
And some vendor IDs that say that IBM and FreeScale make them, and Motorola
apparently rebadges/clones Freescale's (or vice versa)..
I'm *guessing* that this is some all-in-one integrated
north/south/PCI/east bridge with an APIC or similar and some I/O
controllers.... Or maybe it's a board-level designator like 'ebony'
seems to be.. or something..
It's a UART... or a Bus-level board.. or both.. ;)
arch/ppc/Kconfig says this:
config OCP
        bool
        depends on IBM_OCP
        default y
that leads to arch/ppc/platforms/4xx/Kconfig:
config IBM_OCP
        bool
        depends on ASH || CPCI405 || EBONY || EP405 || OCOTEA || REDWOOD_5 || REDWOOD_6 || SYCAMOR
E || WALNUT
        default y
Grepping for OCP in arch/ppc/platforms/4xx/* isn't informative either..
Color me mystified.. ;)
(Actually, other than the apparent lack of any comment that says what
an OCP in fact is, I didn't see any really big style problems while
scrolling through it..)
