Yes, it also happened if I just compiled USB core support in. I would try it
again, but I broke my system upgrading glibc over the weekend(don't ask, I'm
just going to build LFS). I think I have my .config saved, I'll send it when
I get home this evening. When I had core and HC support built into the
kernel, I also had full HID, usb-serial for handspring visors, usb mass
storage, and joystick support. The same configuration has worked flawlessly
on 2.4.x.
Thanks!

Ah, ok.  Haven't heard of this problem before.  The USB core doesn't
touch any hardware, but only initializes a few things, and adds a filesystem
to the kernel if you've selected it as a option.
Does it also happen if you only build the USB core into the kernel, yet
leave the host controllers and other drivers as modules?
Have you selected any USB drivers to be compiled into the kernel?
Can you send me your .config?
thanks,
