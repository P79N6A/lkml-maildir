Fair enough. The API side is trivial, all I need to do is set a single
flag and make splice pass down the page, and set that flag when stealing.
Filesystems might vary from trivial to impossible, but I think most should
be OK. If the flag is there then they at least have the option.

I guess you could fill a filesystem completely, and have a sparse file
in it. Then steal a page and splice it in. The prepare_write should fail,
but the page will still be in pagecache, until it gets reclaimed, then
it will go back to zeroes.
(no I don't have a test case ;)).
You could do something like remove the page if prepare_write fails, but
there is still a window where a read can see it. Basically I can't see
a way that it can possibly work within our current prepare_write API,
and it is a data corruption bug, so in my opinion it is a candidate for
2.6.21 + stable.
