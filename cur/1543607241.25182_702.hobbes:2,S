Subject: issue: deleting one IP alias deletes all

So we've noticed, and taken issue with this behavior.
If you have several IP aliases on an interface (eth0:0, eth0:1, eth0:2) you
get inconsistent behavior when downing them.
* if I 'ifconfig down' eth0:1, I am left with eth0:0 and eth0:2
* if I 'ifconfig down' eth0:0, eth0:1 and eth0:2 go away, too
I assert that this should not happen.  I have a simple patch to fix this
behavior, but I want to know a few things.
* Is this supposed to happen? Why?
* Is it correct that both the real interface and the first alias are marked
as primary (! IFA_F_SECONDARY), while all other aliases are secondary?  It
seems to me that ALL ALIASES should be secondary.  Is this wrong? Why?
Can anyone fill me in?
Thanks
Tim
