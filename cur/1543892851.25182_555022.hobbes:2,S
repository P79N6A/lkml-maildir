That used to be the case before I did a format change.  Compression
pretty much requires a format very similar to JFFS2.  The alternative
would be _huge_ complexity.
However, it would be possible to create specialized XIP segments with
the old page-aligned format.  Supporting two kinds of segment format is
still simpler than supporting compression with the old format.
