  Sure... that's probably true... my knowledge of Linux SCSI device
  drivers is limited to hacking the ability to recognize a PCI card. One
  question though... why does the Mylex DAC960 driver acquire the
  io_request spinlock? They seem to be similar functions to those in the
  BusLogic driver that don't have locks. Oh well... just my ignorance.
There are three separate sets of locking functions defined in the DAC960
driver, which is not a SCSI driver so the rules are somewhat different.
Generalized access to the DAC960 controller requires a lock since the caller
will not already hold the lock.  Request functions already hold the lock and so
cannot reacquire it.  The interrupt holder must again acquire the lock.
These abstractions may not be quite right, but they will make it a lot easier
to divorce the DAC960 driver from the general io_request_lock when that becomes
desirable.
