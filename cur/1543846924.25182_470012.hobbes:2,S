Yes.  I think Greg wants to wait until the old API is completely gone.

That's a separate issue.  You were talking about runtime suspend, but 
closing the laptop's lid is a system suspend.
Assuming some sort of mechanism is in place to do a suspend-to-RAM or 
suspend-to-disk when the lid is closed, the driver's suspend and resume 
methods will be called in the normal way.  The driver doesn't need to do 
anything special to accomodate it.
The only special thing you need to do is autosuspend when the device isn't
in use, so that even when the laptop's lid is open you can still avoid
using unnecessary power.

P.S.: Cutting off port power is yet another issue.  It isn't a suspend in 
the strict sense, because it will break an existing power session.
