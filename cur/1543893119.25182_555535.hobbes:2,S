I have had problems with kingston ram and heavily populated boards
(being ASUS boards didn't help either).  I have found through trial and
error that gigabyte and/or msi boards with crucial memory seems to work
the best, and for servers i always buy low latency ecc ram, even if it
is a slower frequency.  I also had problems with machines that passed
memtest but failed in real life.. you may also want to check your power
supply and make sure you buy boards with multiple (6 or more) voltage
regulators.
