(link to doc for anyone following along at home:
 
http://publibz.boulder.ibm.com/epubs/pdf/a2278324.pdf
)
On the same page it says "All copies of a prefetched instruction are
discarded
when: * A serializing function is performed" Would something like this in a
smp_call_function do it? :
bcr 15,0
if (*p->addr != breakpoint_instruction)
      *p->addr = breakpoint_instruction;
Alternatively, if we did a compare and swap on that location (serializing
instruction) would that be acceptable?
Thanks
Michael
