I thought about the same thing sometimes (but for other troughput
vs. latency decisions, too).
But I realized, that my very own workstation is also a server,
since it runs an httpd, mysqld, smbd, ftpd etc.
And somtimes the servers become very busy in our LAN[1].
IF we want that tuning, we should have it as a sysctl. Most of it
is already possible with /proc/sys/vm/*, but balancing decisions
are still missing.
And even for servers we need to reduce caching sometimes. Think
of an httpd serving _very_ dynamic content. Or any other
application (e.g. DMBS), that doesn't rely on file system
caching.
A anonymous/file-backed[2] ratio would be VERY handy ;-)
But maybe this will be implemented one day along the lines of QoS
in the VM...

[2] Not counting swaps as file backed. We have a special inode
   for the swapper anyway, right?
