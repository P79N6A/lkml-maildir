If we rely on only a int13 tool to write the signature, you're
absolutely right.  Here I was corrected by Michael E. Brown on how we
actually use this - entirely from within Linux which can see all
connected disks.
Here is our algorithm:
        1) look up number in /proc/bios/disk80_sig
        2) scan /dev for this sig
        3) iff *only* one disk with this sig found, that is the bios
boot disk, we are done, use this disk
        4) if multiple disks with this sig found, then write unique sig
to *only* the drives with duplicate signatures, reboot, goto step 1.

EDD/disksig is not a "use by all boot processes by default", it's really
a "used by OS installers", not a normal boot runtime thing.  Starting
from a blank system,  you use the EDD/disksig information to determine
which disk should get the boot loader and your /boot or / file systems,
and then if you want, other file systems.  On subsequent boots, the
information is collected, but isn't necessarily used.  File system
labels and/or file system UUIDs, once they exist, provide the needed
uniqueness to mount your file systems appropriately.

Indeed, adding disks between when you've guaranteed you've got a unique
signature on each disk, and when you make use of this information (in
your OS installer) would be bad - you may break the uniqueness
guarantee.  But I suggest that is unlikely, since the information should
really only be used by the OS installer, and most folks don't change
their hardware config mid-install.
Thanks,
Matt
