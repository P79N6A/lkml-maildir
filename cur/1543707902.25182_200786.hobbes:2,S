Hi,
bash-2.05b# make      
Unable to find VMware installation database. Using
'vmware'.
Building for VMware Workstation 3.2.0.

The strange thing is in Makefile.kernel it has the
line
INCLUDE := -I$(SRCROOT)/include -I$(SRCROOT)/common
-I$(SRCROOT)/linux
I just extract the vmmon.tar from the vmware-any---
package and run make in the source dir. It works with
all vanila kernels and mm tree, but not with mjb1.
Thanks for your reply
