Because whether the provided data is "random enough" is a policy
decision, and policy does not belong in the kernel.

Why not? Alternatively you can always create your own version. Open
source does not mean you get everything for free; it means you _can_ do
the work if you want to.

If they don't have access to the host's hardware, then they do not have a
/dev/hw_random device. What's your question? And how that's different
from machines not having a hw rng at all?

No. It only has to depend on /dev/(u)random. How the entropy is obtained
(from /dev/hw_random, from the soundcard's white noise or from
elsewhere) is none of Openswan's business.  Tha'ts up to the system
administrator or distribution maker to decide and set up.
