I had it running under 2.5.35, but some of the important peripherals
of the machine didn't work with that and I hate doing experiments
when I only have the serial console. I'll get the node affine stuff
finished tomorrow and will try to find a testing slot (that's another
problem :-(  )

No, they are not averaged. I often made 2-3 runs and they usually didn't
differ significantly (within 2-3% of average user time), so I just took
one. Would be cool to have a script for averaging several results, I'll
make that if I get some time, but then we can't look at the distribution
over the nodes. And that's what I find most useful for understanding
what's going on.

Yes, but it's not perfect, as it cannot predict how long the processes
will live. Also it takes into account every running task, no matter
whether it's just a shortly running migration_thread or something else.
A running average might be better, but I have no experience with that.
Any ideas?
Regarding the hackbench times: it forks 20 tasks which fork 20 tasks
each, these are sending messages to each other. Depending on the load
balancing (which is not really predictible) it could happen that you end
up with bad distributions of senders/receivers sometimes.
Best regards,
Erich
