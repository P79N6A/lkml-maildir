Not needed. All device drivers should disable write caches of
their devices, that need another signal than switching it off by
the power button to flush themselves.

Fine. If users/admins have write caching enabled, they either
know what they do, or should disable it (which is the default for
all mass storage drivers AFAIK).
Hardware Level caching is only good for OSes which have broken
drivers and broken caching (like plain old DOS).
Linux does a good job in caching and cache control at software
level.
