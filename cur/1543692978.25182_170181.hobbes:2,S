I am getting these same errors with 2.6.0-test6. The difference is,
I'm not using a SiS IDE controller. I have a Promise 20276 on my
motherboard which was the controller getting the lost interrupt
error. I am running RAID5 using disks on this controller and on a
Promise 20267 PCI card (note: 67 not 76!). I seemed to start getting
the error when my disks started going with lots of activity.
I had booted with "noapic" at the time. Without "noapic" my
motherboard wouldn't boot at all (it seemed to hang right after
detecting the IDE devices, but I don't know if that is relevant).

I was definitely getting this same error.

I was definitely getting this error, except it was on hdg (my promise
20276).

I don't remember if I was getting this error or not.
Here is my lspci output:

I didn't have the forethought to save my dmesg output. This screwed up
my RAID pretty bad, so I'm a little reticent about making it happen
again...
I just wanted to let it known that it wasn't just happening to SiS IDE
controllers.
