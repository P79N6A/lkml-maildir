Marcelo, Alan, do you want me to provide a patch against pre5 or is the
latest sis5513 patch in AC's tree already scheduled for inclusion in Marcelo's
tree ?
Reminder: 2.4.19-pre5's sis5513.c holds 2 show-stoppers :
- incorrect SiS730 support,
- for most chipsets : lack of proper UDMA init if the BIOS doesn't setup
  UDMA itself.
The latest is the one bitting Michal IIRC.
LB.
