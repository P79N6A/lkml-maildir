Ok, great, now that we have the confirmation that this really is a
hardware problem, as I suspected, with Toshiba notebooks, are you (the
guy maintaining that part of the kernel) going to patch the kernel for
this?  I mean - it's silly to fix in kernel hardware problems - but
hey, this is the way things work nowadays, unfortunately...
So, please, either use my patch, or write smth else, but don't let
this float.  I think that a fix like this will be good for any
brain-damaged keyboards - it shouldn't make any difference with a good 
kbd, but it certainly fixes any kbd that would ignore the kbd delay.
Thanks,
Andrei
