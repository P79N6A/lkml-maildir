Good - I figured I'd hear from you on this - thanks.
Are you thinking "definite time" on the order of a second?
I presume you don't require millisecond response time, and that
minute response time would be too slow, right?
And just brainstorming ... if a process is sleeping for a long
time, and the last cpu it executed on is being taken offline,
what need is there to wake up the process?  Let the process
stay asleep, and find it a new home when it wakes up for other
reasons.
In other words, perhaps  the goal of having the smallest,
simplest, least intrusive, most clearly correct code is more
important here than waking up a process just to tell it that
it's last cpu went offline.
