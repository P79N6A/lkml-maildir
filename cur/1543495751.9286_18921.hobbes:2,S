i think i read it when i just started using linux about 2 years ago..
(end of '96, RH4.2, 2.0.18). Was there a kernel nfs server then? Cause
i'm not 100% i read it in linux/Doc... perhaps it was a unfsd feature.
Whatever, I'm sure this feature did exist (somewhere), cause I was so
struck at the usefulness of it.
I've checked the nfs howto and the nfs-root, nfs-root-client
mini-howto's from that era, but can't find back any reference to it. Are
there archives of older kernel tree's online where i could check up the
linux/Doc.. stuff?
Trond: how difficult would it be add this feature to the current knfsd?
it would be really useful in certain situations, eg exporting a single
/etc directory to multiple clients. Or for example i have two seperate
/usr/lib/sane exports, one for the net clients, and one for the sane
server. They need different symlinks. I could avoid a lot of duplication
with a feature like that. 
(also i could edit sendmail.cf once and have it apply to all the 'dumb'
'forward to site server' sendmail client setups.)

Paul Jakma.
