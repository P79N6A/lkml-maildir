 Experiencing the same problem the other way round. 
   Bus  0, device  11, function  0:
    Ethernet controller: Digital Equipment Corporation DECchip 21142/43 (rev 65).
      IRQ 12.
      Master Capable.  Latency=96.  Min Gnt=20.Max Lat=40.
      I/O at 0xe000 [0xe07f].
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xed001000 [0xed0013ff].
 This one works fine with de4x5 but not with tulip although it's
 supported and detected fine I don't get any packets through.
 Did cost me quite a lot of time to discover this. My first thoughts
 were anything but a driver getting no bytes through :/
