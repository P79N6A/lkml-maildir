It is utterly unreasonable to characterise this as "breakage". 
No, we do not really need to implement RLIM_MEMLOCK for such applications.
They can leave their memory unlocked for any reasonable loads.
Yes, we _do_ need to give these applications at least elevated scheduling
priority, if not policy, so they get the CPU in a reasonable period of
time.

You have not defined "fix".  An IO scheduler which attempts to serve every
request within ten milliseconds is an impossibility.  Attempting to 
achieve it will result in something which seeks all over the place.
The best solution is to implement five or ten seconds worth of buffering
in the application and for the kernel to implement a high throughput general
purpose I/O scheduler which does not suffer from starvation.
