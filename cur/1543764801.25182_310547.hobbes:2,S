I already use those - look at my ChangeLog. (That's because for certain
reasons I'm working on git in a half-broken chrooted environment.)
When rebuilding the tree from scratch, I wanted like to do it
transparently - that is, so that noone could notice that I rebuilt it,
since it effectively still _is_ the original tree from the data
standpoint, just the history flow is actually correct this time.

So, who will fix it in his tree first! ;-)
