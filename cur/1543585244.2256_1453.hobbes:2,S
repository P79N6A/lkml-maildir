Okay, I set the nmi_watchdog=0 options for LILO.  Now on crashes,
I get ZERO panic output in the log files.  I found some old
PII 450s, and don't seem to get any panics when I run the PII450s.
I'll remove the nmi_watchdog option, and put the 750s back in,
and see if I can get anymore panic output.
v/r
