What workaround are you using?

The frequency scaling issue sounds like a BIOS/Linux incompatibility.
Please open a bugzilla, if you haven't already, and include the
output from acpidump.
The nvidia issue sounds like an interrupt issue, so please reproduce
it using the open source nvidia driver (not the nvidia binary),
and include the lspci -vv output, dmesg, and /proc/interrupts.
