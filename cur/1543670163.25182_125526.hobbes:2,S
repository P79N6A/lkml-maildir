Disablign AGP turned off 3D. There is a problem in a lot of the current
DRI drivers where shared IRQs break as sometimes do restarts because
the IRQ is not masked properly in the DRI module on close down. Its
certainly true in the -ac tree (Radeon patch pending, someone apparently
has other patches I need to chase).
