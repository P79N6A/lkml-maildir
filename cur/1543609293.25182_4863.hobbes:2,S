Same on IA64, indirect function calls have to save R1, load R1 for the
target function from the function descriptor, call the function,
restore R1.  Incidentally that makes a function descriptor on IA64
_two_ words, you cannot save an IA64 function pointer in a long or even
a void * variable.

IA64 kernels are compiled with -mconstant-gp which tells gcc that
direct calls do not require R1 save/reload, gcc does not even generate
a nop.  However indirect function calls from one part of the kernel to
another still require save and reload code, gcc cannot tell if the call
is local or not.

Same on IA64, calls from a module into the kernel require R1 save and
reload, even if the call is direct.  So there is some code overhead
when making direct function calls from modules to kernel on IA64, that
overhead disappears when code is linked into the kernel.  Indirect
functions calls always have the overhead, whether in kernel or in
module.
