Well pft is old and limited in what it can do. I'd be glad if you could 
put it into memtoy. Then it may perhaps be useful in the future.

But we have had this ref counting issue forever with no ill effect. Memory 
policies were designed to have almost no overhead for the default 
allocation paths. Incrementing and decrementing refcounters makes that 
design no longer light weight as it was intended to be.
