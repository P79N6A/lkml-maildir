I didn't see what CPU this was, but there was this nasty erratum on some 
Athlon 64/Opteron processors. I was trying to debug a problem someone 
else mentioned a while ago (and which I could duplicate on my system) 
where doing huge memsets in userspace (which glibc uses non-temporal 
stores for) repeatedly would cause a system lockup or crash. Amazingly 
enough after I upgraded the CPU from my old Athlon 64 3500+ to a new X2 
4200+ the problem went away..
At the time I looked into whether this workaround could be applied in 
the kernel if the BIOS failed to, but it seemed that accesses to the MSR 
they mentioned failed, so I don't know what the story is..

Erratum 97: 128-Bit Streaming Stores May Cause Coherency Failure
Description: Under a specific set of internal pipeline conditions, stale 
data may be left in the L1 cache when a 128-bit streaming store (MOVNT*) 
to a writeback (WB) memory type misses in the L1 data cache and both L1 
and L2 TLBs.
Potential Effect on System
Memory coherence failures leading to unpredictable operation.
Suggested Workaround
BIOS should set DC_CFG.DIS_CNV_WC_SSO (bit 3 of MSR 0xC001_1022). The 
performance effects of setting this bit are limited to streaming stores 
to the write-combining (WC) memory type, a case expected to rarely occur 
in actual usage. No loss of performance occurs in the general case (WB 
memory type).
This workaround must not be applied to processors prior to revision C0.
