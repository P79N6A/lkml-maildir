I do plainly agree that this would make the code more readable here.
But it has a significant downside:
Once you have a different set of file operations for either case, you
also need to have a different file_operations struct in each individual
filesystem using this. Also, this moves the check "do we have xip today?"
from here to the filesystem that needs to decide which file operations
struct to use.
Looking forward, there may be multiple filesystems using this which
leads to duplicating the need for this check.

Good point. This was derived from try_to_unmap_one before that one
was added. Btw: Should'nt this function move to rmap.c anyway?
