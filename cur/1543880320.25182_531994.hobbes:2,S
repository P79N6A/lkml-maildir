9303 is stuck here on demux_lock:
#0  0xffffe410 in __kernel_vsyscall ()
#1  0x4a2538ce in __lll_mutex_lock_wait () from /lib/libpthread.so.0
#2  0x4a24f71c in _L_mutex_lock_79 () from /lib/libpthread.so.0
#3  0x4a24f24d in pthread_mutex_lock () from /lib/libpthread.so.0
#4  0xb79f64f9 in xine_play () from /usr/lib/libxine.so.1
that mutex related futex is at address 0xb07409e0, but the only sign in 
the strace of that futex being touched is:
9303  futex(0xb07409e0, FUTEX_WAIT, 2, NULL <unfinished ...>
no other event ever happens on futex 0xb07409e0. Other threads dont 
touch it.
Maybe thread 9324 is the owner of that mutex, and it's looping somewhere 
that does xine_xmalloc_aligned(), with the lock held? It did this:
#0  0xffffe410 in __kernel_vsyscall ()
#1  0x4a2539e1 in __lll_mutex_unlock_wake () from /lib/libpthread.so.0
#2  0x4a2506f9 in _L_mutex_unlock_99 () from /lib/libpthread.so.0
#3  0x4a250370 in __pthread_mutex_unlock_usercnt () from /lib/libpthread.so.0
#4  0x4a2506f0 in pthread_mutex_unlock () from /lib/libpthread.so.0
#5  0xb79fce5a in QWidget::setUpdatesEnabled () from /usr/lib/libxine.so.1
#6  0xb7a4b90b in dvd_plugin_free_buffer (buf=0xb0745470) at input_dvd.c:570
#7  0xb7a030a2 in QWidget::setUpdatesEnabled () from /usr/lib/libxine.so.1
#8  0x4a24d2db in start_thread () from /lib/libpthread.so.0
#9  0x4a05820e in clone () from /lib/libc.so.6
