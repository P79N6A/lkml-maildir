        Hi Jeff,
	As promised earlier, the new irtty driver ! This new driver
should work properly with the new serial driver in 2.5.X. As the old
irtty, the most used driver, was broken with the new serial driver,
you can guess that this is a pretty important update for most users...
	This has been tested in 2.5.44 and 2.5.46. There is still more
work to be done around the new irtty driver (like converting other
dongle drivers), but at least this should get most people going. I
will also probably remove the old drivers before 2.6.X proper (but we
need a new irport first).
	I still have other goodies in my patch queue, but they will
wait for the next update.
	Have fun...
	Jean
