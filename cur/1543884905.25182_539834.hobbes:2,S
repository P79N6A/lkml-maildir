Documentation is good, and percpu probably misses one, but please add it in a Documentation/percpu.txt file, because it's the right place.
You then can really have an extensive documentation, and you wont slow down kernel compiles...
I suggest you document all variants (get_cpu_var(), __get_cpu_var(), ...) with examples of use
Also, please note that per cpu data is not allocated * NR_CPUS, but depends on possible cpus. So if you boot an SMP kernel on a one CPU desktop, kernel allocates only the needed space.
So per_cpu data has also a space saving argument against structures declared with [NR_CPUS] arrays.
Thank you
