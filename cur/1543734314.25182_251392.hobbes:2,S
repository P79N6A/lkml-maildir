He can also get precise info with Dave Jones' parsemce tool :
    
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/davej/tools/
It currently says :
	Status: (4) Machine Check in progress.
	Restart IP invalid.
	parsebank(0): 820000001040080f @ 0
		External tag parity error
		CPU state corrupt. Restart not possible
		Bus and interconnect error
		Participation: Local processor originated request
		Timeout: Request did not timeout
		Request: Generic error
		Transaction type : Invalid
		Memory/IO : Other
Since it says it's neither memory nor I/O, I think it might be related to
a PCI parity error with some card, either during transfers or config access.
