Currently neither, but that could be easily fixed.

Well if you really worry about it then it might be better to do some dynamic
code patching to make generic and distribution kernels too.

Agreed on the general direction, but I didn't see an alternative
for kprobes for this. Well actually the hook could be maybe
right now moved into the part before kernel oops which is much less
frequently executed, but then it'll likely move up again once
kprobes support user space probes.
