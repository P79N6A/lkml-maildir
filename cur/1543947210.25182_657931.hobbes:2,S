The cfq use of it, not the radix tree code! It juggled the keys and
wants to make sure that we see all users, modulo raced added ones (ok if
we see them, doesn't matter if we don't).

I could not convince myself that the current code would always do the
right thing. We should not have been seeing ->key == NULL entries in
there, it implied a double exit of that process. So I decided to fix it
by making the code a lot more readable (the patch in question deleted a
lot more than it added), at the cost of that hlist head + node.
