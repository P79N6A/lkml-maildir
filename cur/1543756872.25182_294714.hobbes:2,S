Yes, I am running the SATA in combined mode. That, along with Auto mode, 
is the only way I can get all my devices to work properly under linux. 
Under Enhanced mode there is no primary IDE, only second and third. My 
ATA drive and CDROM are hdc and hdd, which is normal, my first SATA 
drive which would normally be hda should be hde and the other drive 
should be hdf. But the kernel doesnt see them and I cant boot off my 
normally hda, I get an invalid root= option kernel panic. I did edit 
lilo to reflect the change, but the drive wasnt even listed when hdc and 
hdd were. Under SATA only, I only get the SATA drives, and not my ATA 
drive nor my CDROM. With SATA diabled, I cant get the SATA drives at all 
which I expected.
Under Auto, which is the same as combined as far as I can tell, the 
kernel doesnt enable DMA for the drives using libata, and trying to 
enable it by hand yields the HDIO_SET_DMA failed: Operation not 
permitted error.
So, unless there is better performance from libata with ICH5 combined 
mode, I am 'forced' to stay with CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE_SATA, which isnt a 
bad thing really. I get good performance from the drives, and havent had 
any problems yet.
On a another note, kernel 2.4.30-pre1 with highmem is working fine for 
me, using CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE_SATA, uptime was a little over 2 days.
