Yes, I saw this (google sent me to a much older version when I looked,
but I just found your more recent one).
I like the fact that you have no internal array, but I like the fact
that I preserve the raw groups pointer.  You go furthur and try to do
better than linear search, too, I was aiming for minimalism.

Perhaps, but I was being cautious.  With the default setting, it's
identical to the current situation.
Cheers,
