Ok. But If I copy the /proc/vmcore to disk. Then I reboot the system 
and boot back into a kernel which is supposed to resume the hibernated
image. This kernel will not have any command line option jump_back_entry.
I  need to resume using krestore tool. How will a krestore tool decide that
image one wants to restore is a core file or a hibernated image?
In this context I thought an PT_NOTE might be useful.

Why should we exchange backup page map information between two kernels?
What data has been swapped and how to restore it back should be known
to the kernel who did it. I think the memory info and address of ELF
headers we can still pass to second kernel the same way we do for
/proc/vmcore. The only difference is that purgatory shall have to modify 
the command line to reflect the new address of ELF headers just before
jumping to new kernel (because of swapping).
We can also modify the actual ELF headers in purgatory to reflect the
right data (because of swapping) and new kernel will not have to know
anything about swapping.
So I thought of following sequence.
Lets say there is production kernel A and there is helper kernel B (B
will save the hibernated image of A).
- Boot into A.
- Load kernel B using --load-preserve-context.
- This load operation can also create the Elf headers.   
- Kexec -e will start hibernation of A. Pages shall be swapped. Control
  will be transferred to purgatory.
- Purgatory will readjust the ELF headers and command line based on 
  the swapping done and jump to new kernel.
- New kernel will retrieve the elf headers and export the memory of
  hibernated kernel through /proc/vmcore.
Hence there is no need to communicate swapped pages map between two
kernels.

Shouldn't we be able to load this image using --load-preseve-context? Why
to create another otion --flags.
So there seems to be two different kind of load options for resuming
for two different kind of images.
- For /proc/vmcore kind of images use krestore (which will use
  --load-jump-back-helper)
- For /proc/kimgcore kind of images use normal kexec -l.
This is little confusing. How will one differentiate between two kind
of files? In fact the semantics between two kind of files are not very
clear. We need to do some kind of unification here and make the whole
thing somewhat simple.

I think vmcoreinfo is stored in a PT_NOTE and passed to second kernel
parses it while parsing all ELF headers? No separate ptr or anything
else is passed to second kernel on command line.

I think modifying a kernel's data structures externally without kernel
knowing it is dangerous. 
I would think that initially we can keep it simple and not suppot
resuming. Resuming is little tough as you need to make sure kernel's
complete env has been restored back. But in this case, we are playing
with resume env, for example, changing of vmcoreinfo etc.
Capability to resume the already booted kernel (Kernel B here), creates
a coupling with the kernel it has booted with in the past (Kernel A) and
that's why you end up modifying various things once you swith to B 
from C. I think we should boot B fresh all the time to save the hibernated
image of kernel A or C (Though it will take more time for hibernation).
It keeps things simple.
If you still want to support resuming the kernel, then I would think that in
resume path kernel should re-initialize/re-construct /proc/vmcore
(parse vmcoreinfo again) etc, instead of modifying the image of loaded kernel
through /proc/kimgcore interface.
We can probably think of a setup page where all the needed data is put and
this page is used as a communication medium between two kernels (Something
like the way, a page of data is passed between boot-loader and kernel to
communicate the info like command line etc).
So in the above example, kernel C will pass some data to kernel B (on
setup page). This data will also include the pointer to new ELF headers
(which also includes vmcoreinfo PT_NOTE). Resume path of kernel B
will parse this data and re-initialize vmcore accordingly.
