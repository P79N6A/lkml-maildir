Yup, but this is when doing char-by-char operations.
When using one or two memcpy() we have only two '%' intead of 
(perhaps) many 'if's.
Of course the memcpy() has its own while() loop but since it's 
optimized in assembly (and I guess we're not going to implement
kfifo_get/put in assembly) I will stay with the memcpy + '%' version.
