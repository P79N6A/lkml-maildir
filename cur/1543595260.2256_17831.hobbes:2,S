Sigh... Guys, who maintains l-k FAQ?
Q: I've mounted filesystem in two different places and it worked. Why?
A: Because you've asked to do that. Yes, it works. No, it's not a bug.
Q: what should I do to unmount it?
A: umount <mountpoint>
Q: but that took care only of one of them. How can I deal with another?
A: umount <another_mountpoint>
