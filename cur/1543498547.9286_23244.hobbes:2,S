I just downloaded and configured 2.3.6, here is what I get during the make dep
phase:
mv /usr/src/linux-2.3.6/include/linux/modules/i386_ksyms.ver.tmp /usr/src/linux-2.3.6/include/linux/modules/i386_ksyms.ver

My config file is below.  Anyone got any ideas?  I am currently running 2.3.5
with Alan's ac1 patch.  I diffed the 2.3.6 config and the 2.3.5ac1 config and
the only difference is:

This was achived by sorting the 2 files first before doing the diff.
