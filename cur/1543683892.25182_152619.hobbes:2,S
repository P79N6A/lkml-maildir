Hi Honza!
Quota is definitely broken in 2.6.0-test2 because the
code tries to acquire dqio_sem in *_read_file_info, while
already holding the same sem in vfs_quota_on, which
simply deadlocks ...
removing the down(dqio_sem) in vfs_quota_on at least
allows quota to be enabled 8-) but still deadlocks on 
quota transfers? ... :(
it seems this stuff hasn't been tested since the last
update? doesn't anybody use quota anymore?
best,
Herbert
