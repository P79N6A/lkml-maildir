The intitial motivation for creating two children at once was so each
parent could pass on all of their genes.  The 75% of the parent's genes
might be in child A, but the other 25% would be in child B.  
Thinking about it more, there should be no reason that all of a parent's
genes have to be passed on in a child.  It would not be too difficult to
have each gene come randomly from one of the two parents.  I'll add that
in on the next rev of the patches. 
Thanks,
Jake
