Here's a more general proof.
As I understand it, calc_nr is given nr_copy, the number of data pages
that need to be written out, and it has to return the number of pages
needed to hold the image data plus a bunch of PBE pagedir indexes, where
each page gets one index (and pages containing PBEs need their own indexes
as well).
For brevity, let n = nr_copy, let p = PBES_PER_PAGE, and let x be the 
number of pagdir pages needed.  Since each page can hold p PBEs, there 
will be room to store px PBEs.  The total number of pages is n + x, so 
the routine needs to find the smallest value of x for which
	px >= n + x
or
	(p-1)x >= n
or
	x >= n / (p-1).
The obvious solution is
	x = ceiling(n / (p-1)),
so calc_nr should return n + ceiling(n / (p-1)), which is exactly what 
Michal's patch computes.
