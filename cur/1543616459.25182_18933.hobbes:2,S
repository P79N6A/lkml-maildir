Sorry but the amount of capacity we are talking about is vastly different.
hdg: Maxtor 4G160J8, ATA DISK drive
hdg: 320173056 sectors (163929 MB) w/2048KiB Cache, CHS=317632/255/63, UDMA(133)

Only the patches I have created will allow Linux to address the drives
correctly, since this is a new protocol for loading the taskfile
registers with 48-bit mode.  The other drive is being addressed in 28-bit
mode, and can NEVER access the remaining difference under this protocol.
320,173,056 - 268,435,455 = 5,173,7601 sectors
5,173,7601 * 512 = 26,489,651,712 
Roughly 26.4GB of drive capacity lost, the kernel without patches
will never address more that 137GB, and the loss of usable capacity will
continue to grow until the problem in the kernel is addressed.
All it will take is to have the 2.2/2.4/2.5 kernel maintainers to agree to
the corrective patches.
