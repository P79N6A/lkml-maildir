No, that is not the same topic or thread.

The code was totally rewritten from what was in 2.6.10-mm1, it was not
just a simple "license change".  All in-kernel users were converted, and
the known closed-source users of this code were also contacted and they
have already changed their code (nvidia being one of these users.)
If you know of any closed source code, using those functions, please put
them in contact with me.

What problem is this change causing you?  Do you have code that calls
these old, now gone, functions?
