Alright, there's our confusion.  I thought you were gonna use dev->sem
to protect new device addition && driver binding.  We can use the same
rwsem directly for binding protection too but I guess there's no big
difference one way or the other.

Thanks for enlightening me.  Probably what can be done is blocking
regular file sysfs nodes automatically and make it optional (optionally
enable or disable) for bin attrs.

I see.  Let's see how the direct suicide thing works out.
Thanks.
