Because printks are our only debugging option ("thanks", Linus), and a slow
serial port block and can change the timing of when code runs, I need the
serial port to run as fast as possible. It would be keen to be able to use
an ethernet debugging console rather than (or in addition to) serial,
because it would be even faster, and if I'm debugging (for instance) a
serial driver, I won't have to use the system I'm debugging to debug the
system I'm debugging.
Of course, a supported kernel debugger would make a nice addition to faster
console output, but I won't hold my breath waiting for Linux to acquire what
pretty much every other operating system already has.
