Apart from this issue, we haven't seen any code- or compiler-related
problems due to misaligned loads and stores occurring.  Indeed, because
gcc takes care to lay out structures to honour load/store alignments, we
deliberately don't 'fix-up' misaligned accesses, rather an oops is
raised since they are almost certainly due to something having gone
wrong, e.g.  a pointer has been overwritten somehow.
I bet someone will wonder how the misalignment hadn't shown up before.
Recall there were 2 structures being allocated with 1 kmalloc call.  The
first (nfs3_diropargs) contains 2 pointers and an unsigned int.  The
second (nfs_fattr) contains amongst other things some __u64's.  On sh64,
the __u64's will be accessed with single 8-byte load/store operations.
Although the SHmedia instruction set fully supports 64-bit addressing,
the current generation implements 32-bit (with sign-extension to 64) so
the toolchains currently store pointers as 32-bit to save memory &
cache.  Hence the 1st structure is only compiled with 4-byte alignment
=> insufficiently aligned 2nd structure in the old code.  I presume all
the other 64-bit architectures already use 64-bit pointers so the
alignment problem didn't happen.  With the patch I sent, the required
alignments are assured for any architecture.
