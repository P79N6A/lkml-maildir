IMHO, the ultimate language for the Linux kernel is C language rather
than English.  Nothing prevents one with poor English to write good C
code except for the comment part.  However if the code is really good to
be understood on its own, the problem is not that important then.
Moreover, the case here is not about people who can't read/write in
English completely.  It is to help and to encourage people who have some
difficulty to deal with the community but has the basic English skill to
deal with technical discussion.  That's like why we have disability
services for special people who can do things actually.
