Thanks. If that doesn't do it, can you start binary-searching on kernel 
versions? I run with preempt myself (well, not on my current G5 desktop, 
but otherwise), so it _should_ be stable, but you may have a driver or 
something else that doesn't like preempt.
Or it could be any number of other config options. Do you have anything 
else interesting enabled?
