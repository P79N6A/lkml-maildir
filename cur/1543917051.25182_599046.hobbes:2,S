With %lu you get warnings when u64 is long long (32-bit).
With %llu you get warnings when u64 is plain long (most 64-bit).
Hence %llu + long long cast, i.e.:
printf("%llu", (unsigned long long)value);
This is ugly but luckily imposes no runtime overheads on
current 32- or 64-bit machines.
This could be done more cleanly if the u64 typedef also
#define:d a corresponding FMT_U64 format string.
