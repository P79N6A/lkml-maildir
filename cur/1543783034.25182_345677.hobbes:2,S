There is nothing in dmesg:

Ok, I did run the following dd command in different combinations:
    dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sd?1 bs=4k count=5000000
Here the results:
    Each disk alone
    /dev/sdc1 59.094636 MB/s
    /dev/sdd1 58.686592 MB/s
    /dev/sde1 55.282807 MB/s
    /dev/sdf1 62.271240 MB/s
    /dev/sdg1 60.872891 MB/s
    /dev/sdh1 62.252781 MB/s
    /dev/sdi1 59.145637 MB/s
    /dev/sdj1 60.921119 MB/s
    sdc + sdd in parallel (2 disks on same channel)
    /dev/sdc1 42.512287 MB/s
    /dev/sdd1 43.118483 MB/s
    sdc + sdg in parallel (2 disks on different channels)
    /dev/sdc1 42.938186 MB/s
    /dev/sdg1 43.934779 MB/s
    sdc + sdd + sde in parallel (3 disks on same channel)
    /dev/sdc1 35.043501 MB/s
    /dev/sdd1 35.686878 MB/s
    /dev/sde1 34.580457 MB/s
    Similar results for three disks (sdg + sdh + sdi) on the other channel
    /dev/sdg1 36.381137 MB/s
    /dev/sdh1 37.541758 MB/s
    /dev/sdi1 35.834920 MB/s
    sdc + sdd + sde + sdf in parallel (4 disks on same channel)
    /dev/sdc1 31.432914 MB/s
    /dev/sdd1 32.058752 MB/s
    /dev/sde1 31.393455 MB/s
    /dev/sdf1 33.208165 MB/s
    And here for the four disks on the other channel
    /dev/sdg1 31.873028 MB/s
    /dev/sdh1 33.277193 MB/s
    /dev/sdi1 31.910000 MB/s
    /dev/sdj1 32.626744 MB/s
    All 8 disks in parallel
    /dev/sdc1 24.120545 MB/s
    /dev/sdd1 24.419801 MB/s
    /dev/sde1 24.296588 MB/s
    /dev/sdf1 25.609548 MB/s
    /dev/sdg1 24.572617 MB/s
    /dev/sdh1 25.552590 MB/s
    /dev/sdi1 24.575616 MB/s
    /dev/sdj1 25.124165 MB/s
So from these results, I may assume that md is not the cause of the problem.
What comes as a big surprise is that I loose 25% performance with only
two disks and each hanging on its own channel!
Is this normal? I wonder if other people have the same problem with
other controllers or the same.
What can I do next to find out if this is a kernel, driver or hardware
problem?
Thanks,
Holger
