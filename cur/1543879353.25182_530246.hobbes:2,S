Went back to SLAB, got a compile error. Did a make clean
and compiled again. Got some warnings:

Setup is 7302 bytes.
System is 3075 kB
Kernel: arch/x86_64/boot/bzImage is ready  (#11)
Then I booted this - and it hung exactly the same way.
I thought SLUB was reasonbably safe, it is new but not marked experimental.
