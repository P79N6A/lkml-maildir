Hello,
   so I've enabled JBD-DEBUG, and unfortunately somebody corrupted inode instead 
of journal head this time :-(  But corruption looks same - somebody wrote 32bit 
value 1 somewhere it should not...  Does anybody have something like 
CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGE_ALLOC for x86-64?

This time I was not doing anything special, just building new kernel & browsing web.
