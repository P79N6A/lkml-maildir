I think we should take this as a goal.  Last time I checked, d80211 wasn't in
-mm.  Perhaps it should go there.  And by the way, the latest changes from
netdev->class_dev to netdev->dev break d80211.  Perhaps we should rebase
wireless-dev immediately after 2.6.21-rc1, fix all compile issues and submit
the patch to -mm.
And iwlwifi is surprisingly good for a just announced driver.  It worked for me
from the first attempt, and that's the first d80211 driver to do so.  In my
opinion, it should go to wireless-dev as soon as possible so it can go to -mm
toghether with other drivers.  A couple of wrinkles in the standalone build
system are irrelevant to the kernel interation.
