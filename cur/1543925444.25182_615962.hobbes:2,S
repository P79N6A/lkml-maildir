While I respect you opinion about tabs, I find tab indentation the most
evil thing ever invented. Even if done right (that is, not indenting
using a mixture of spaces and tabs), the only advantage is that you save
a few bytes.
So my opinion is: use spaces. The code indentation will look the same on
every editor no matter the tab settings.
