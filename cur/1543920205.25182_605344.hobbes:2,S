You're right I missed that. (I even read it). But for fixes like this, (or
any patches that are not in the tree), you really need to resend the
series.
When Ingo posts patches to LKML on CFS, if there's a little fix like this,
he'll add that to his next queue and repost.

There wouldn't be if we didn't have to go looking for patches on patches
that are out of the series. If you see that a series is broken, don't
patch against it. Resend the series!
Patches must be against upstream, unless they are more RFC (like what
Gregory is doing). But when you want them to go upstream, they must be
against upstream.  I don't have the time to look for little fixes that
you've done to your own patches that have not been pulled in yet.
