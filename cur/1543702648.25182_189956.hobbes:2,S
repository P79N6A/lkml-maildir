Hmm... let's see...
The assembler calculates in arch/i386/boot/setup.S (with the
definition of MAXMEM from include/asm-i386/page.h):
        - 0xC0000000 - 0x08000000 - 1
This obviously is a negative number which is what the assembler
warns us about.
As there are no negative memory addresses anyway, the number we really
want is the positive number
        (1 << 32) - 0xC0000000 - 0x08000000 - 1
which is the same in modulo (1 << 32) arithmetic, of course.
Original arch/i386/boot/setup.o (subtract from 0):
0000002c <ramdisk_max>:
      2c:	ff                   	(bad)  
      2d:	ff                   	(bad)  
      2e:	ff 37                	pushl  (%edi)
Patched arch/i386/boot/setup.o (subtract from (1<<32)):
0000002c <ramdisk_max>:
      2c:	ff                   	(bad)  
      2d:	ff                   	(bad)  
      2e:	ff 37                	pushl  (%edi)
This looks OK to me so far.
However, a few issues remain:
- There probably are some nasty side effects in other places
  which I haven't thought about.
- I didn't try to boot the patched kernel yet.
- As I don't know whether the C compiler might get confused about
  that, I re-used the #ifdef in include/asm-i386/page.h.
  Subtracting UL constants from (0UL) shouldn't make a difference,
  even if subtracting from 0x100000000UL might.
- __MAXMEM_ADDRSPACE_MAX should probably be defined using a
  constant from somewhere else. (Where from?)
