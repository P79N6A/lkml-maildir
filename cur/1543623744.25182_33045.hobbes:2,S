And these processes will not be waiting on pages as often, either, as
pages will be more plentiful.
From the reports I've seen, typical numbers of waiters on pages, even
on large systems, are as much as an order of magnitude fewer in number
than 4096. It would seem applications need to wait on pages less with
the increased memory size.
