Yes, I've looked at the howto several times, and even downloaded the
drivers.
You may have missed the second paragraph I wrote:

Now I was wrong in a couple points:
	As Linus pointed to me, the Atheros driver now works even with 2.6. 
	They're not binary only, but part-binary, which is somewhat better
	(not dependent on exact kernel version, just on compiler version and
	kernel major version).
But still both the Realtek and ADMtek drivers are useless with 2.6.
