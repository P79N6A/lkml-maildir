Well it sort-of works.  I started kde (fc8 install) and ran
	play /usr/share/sounds/KDE_Close_Window.wav
and a prompt appeared titled "Error - artsmessage" with content "Sound
server fatal error: cpu overload, aborting".
After OKing that, the `play' command still works.
What could cause such a thing??
