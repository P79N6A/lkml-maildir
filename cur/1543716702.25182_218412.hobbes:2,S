No - this has several disadvantages - mainly you can  snapshot only whole "logical volume" and have preserved space for it (okay - you can add more disks) and it's not very flexible. My approach can even snapshot files to the NFS volume and if you loose primary volume you can still recover some data.

Yeah - I'm now convinced that user space daemon is "The Only Right Thing (tm)". I'm now looking how can kernel comunicate with running user-space process.
