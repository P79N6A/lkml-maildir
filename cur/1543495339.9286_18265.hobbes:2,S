Hello,
This is just to let you know of a repository of my patches (cleanup or
otherwise) for your review and critique:
http://www.aivazian.demon.co.uk/patches/recent
As any of them end up in official kernel I delete them and update the
"Checked against X.Y.Z" title, i.e. it indicates the most recent kernel in
which my patches *are not* included.
Regards,
Tigran.
