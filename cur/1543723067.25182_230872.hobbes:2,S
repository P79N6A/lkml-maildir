It would replace some uses of __packed__, where the first element
is aligned.

I did suggest that. I still think it has some advantages, but I am not
sure whether they are sufficient
1) Not every structure is that simple
2) It is an architecture specific requirement
3) padding rules might change
4) It simplifies driver writing
