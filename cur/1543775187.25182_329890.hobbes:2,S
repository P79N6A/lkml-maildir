Your first part seemed half joking and half serious, so I responded with a
more serious answer, just to make sure that others don't think  I write
code like this:
spin_lock_irqsave(lock1,flags1);
spin_lock_irqsave(lock2,flags2);
spin_lock_irqsave(lock3,flags3);
Which would just be really silly!  But you never know ;-)

is the future.
