The first rule of optimization: don't. I.e. optimizing something that
is not a bottleneck is pointless.

Or, in that case, in favour of nothing. It doesn't add any functionality.

	In that case there is much simpler argument.
If your program checks the system load so often that converting results
from ASCII to integers takes noticable time - all you are measuring
is the load created by that program. In other words, any program that
would get any speedup from such syscall is absolutely worthless, since
the load created by measurement will drown the load you are trying
to measure.
	End of story. It's not only unnecessary and tasteless, it's
useless.
