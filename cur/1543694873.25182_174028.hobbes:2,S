it's all nice code and such, but I still wonder why this can't be done
by a userland policy daemon. The 2.6 kernel has the infrastructure to
give very detailed information to userspace (eg top etc) about idle
percentages...... I didn't see anything in this driver that couldn't be
done from userspace.
Note that I'm not totally against doing some of this in the kernel; I
can well see the point of say, detecting an IRQ overload and based on
that, go to max speed in the kernel because it's a situation where
userspace doesn't even run; but the patch as is doesn't do any such
advanced things...
