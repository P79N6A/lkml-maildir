Subject: [PATCH 003 of 4] md: Make sure the events count in an md array never returns to zero.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/1/22/228

Now that we sometimes step the array events count backwards
(when transitioning dirty->clean where nothing else interesting
has happened - so that we don't need to write to spares all the time),
it is possible for the event count to return to zero, which is
potentially confusing and triggers and MD_BUG.
We could possibly remove the MD_BUG, but is just as easy, and
probably safer, to make sure we never return to zero.
