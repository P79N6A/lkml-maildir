Thank you for this thread!
libscg now has 5 different SCSI transport interface implementations
only for Linux.
There are still problems like e.g. USB which not really usable.

A reasonable idea would be to make the ATA driver a SCSI HBAdriver and
in case that there is a need for pure ATA (e.g. Hard disks) there should
be a second interface for a ATA driver stack.
Please keep me on the CC: I am not on the list.
