since when does the language make any difference.
Anyway you are still under the impression that a Linux kernel module can
be original work in the end. We keep telling you that could be a wrong
assumption which is based on the view of many of the kernel developers
and of most of the lawyers that looked at this specific topic.
Let me repeat this. Ask a legal counsel before you go ahead with your
assumption. You might get away with it or you might not. What Greg, Alan
and I try to tell you is that using EXPORT_SYMBOL or EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL
will create derivative work, but if you don't wanna believe us, that is
your prerogative. So go ahead, but don't complain if you actually get
sued for copyright infringement at some point and tell the court you
didn't know.
And while you are talking to a lawyer. Ask him/her if it is okay to
create a binary only application that uses a GPL library. Tell him/her
that it is original work. Good luck :)
Regards
Marcel
