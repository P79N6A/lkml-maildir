Paul,
	I logged into elm3b6 and did some investigation. I think I have
a tentative patch to fix your load-balance problem.
First, an explanation of the problem:
This particular machine, elm3b6, is a 4-cpu, (gasp, yes!) 4-node box i.e 
each CPU is a node by itself. If you don't have CONFIG_NUMA enabled,
then we won't have cross-node (i.e cross-cpu) load balancing.
Fortunately in your case you had CONFIG_NUMA enabled, but still were
hitting the (gross) load imbalance.
The problem seems to be with idle_balance(). This particular routine,
invoked by schedule() on a idle cpu, walks up sched-domain hierarchy and
tries to balance in each domain that has SD_BALANCE_NEWIDLE flag set.
The nodes-level domain (SD_NODE_INIT) however doesn't set this flag,
which means idle cpu looks for (im)balance within its own node at most and
not beyond. Now, here's the problem, if the idle cpu doesn't find
imbalance within its node (pulled_tasks = 0), it resets this_rq->next_balance
so that next balancing activity is deferred for upto a minute
(next_balance = jiffies + 60 *  HZ). If a idle cpu calls idle_balance
again in the next minute and finds no imbalance within its node, it
-again- resets next_balance. In your case, I think this was happening
repetetively, which made other CPUs never look for cross-node
(im)balance.
I believe the patch below is correct. With the patch applied, I could
not recreate the imbalance with rcutorture. Let me know whether you
still see the problem with this patch applied on any other machine.
I have CCed others who have worked in this area and request them to review 
this patch.
Andrew,
	If there is no objection from anyone, request you to pick this
up for next -mm release. It has been tested against 2.6.22-rc4-mm2.
idle_balance() can erroneously cause system-wide imbalance to be overlooked
by reseting rq->next_balance. When called sufficient number of times, it
can forever defer system-wide load balance. Patch below modifies
idle_balance() not to mess with ->next_balance. If indeed it turns out
that there is no imbalance even system-wide, rebalance_domains() will
anyway set ->next_balance to happen after a minute.
