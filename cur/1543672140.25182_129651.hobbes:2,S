I mentioned Windows because it happens to have a very mature threading 
implementation and I don't see why Unix can't look at something from 
Windows as a reference.
Anyway, I understand your argument about thread vs processes resources. I 
also checked that it works the same way on Solaris (which of course is a 
better reference point for Linux), so I agree that fcntl behavior is ok. 
Thanks for your explanation!
