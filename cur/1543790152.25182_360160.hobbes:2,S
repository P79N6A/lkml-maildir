Ok.  I don't know if we care but I do know why we were not seeing
the report from the bios about your boot processor.  We record
information about cpus for up to NR_CPUS, and since you had
a UP kernel NR_CPUS was one.
From your earlier boot log.

So it looks like we have this problem completely fixed.  
I don't see a good way to ensure that we always record our boot
apicid when we boot a multiple processor system and only use one
processor.
