There are lots of differences.  From memory, Jon tried to enhance the FB 
layer to do modesetting with an eye toward multiseat support.  Modes were 
set by echoing values into sysfs, and iirc it didn't tie into the DRM 
layer at all or use proper memory management.
These patches use ioctls on the DRM device for modesetting (at least for 
now), and provide userspace with maximum flexibility.  Framebuffer objects 
are allocated using the new DRM memory manager, and any FB devices created 
are slaves of the DRM layer, avoiding some of the fighting over 
suspend/resume and graphics programming.
Many of the aims are the same though, Jon was trying to address many of the 
problems outlined in my initial mail too, we just have different opinions 
about how exactly those problems should be solved. :)
