In general, if the data has no semantic meaning (ie it's just a blob), and 
there really is some point to exporting it, it should be exported as a 
binary blob. There's no point in doing some random "ASCII conversion" if 
the data doesn't have any known semantics. Bytes? Words? Longwords? 
Byteorder? It's simply not a sensible operation, and the only sane 
interface is to just read a binary blob with the raw data.
That's true in general of PCI config space. Of course, _some_ parts of PCI 
config space do indeed have meaning, so you'll find the "device" and 
"vendor" and other things like that as separate nodes in /sysfs with ASCII 
representations. So sometimes you may have mixtures (but it would be 
stupid to try to "remove" the semantic data from the blob - then it would 
turn into a _true_ monster).
So it's not like binary blobs are not allowed. In general, the rule should 
be:
 - all independent values should show up as independent files (never mix 
   stuff up that you don't need to)
 - anything with semantic meaning should have the appropriate semantic 
   textual format (ie formatted ASCII, not just raw data).
The _goal_ is that you can look at sysfs with a file manager, and the 
results should make sense.
