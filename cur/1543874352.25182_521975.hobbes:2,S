According to lore (Andi, I think), asm() always clobbers cc.

Actually, it still does need a temp register.  The sequence for cli is:
    mov %fs:xen_vcpu, %eax
    movb $1,1(%eax)
At some point I hope to move the vcpu structure directly into the
pda/percpu variables, at which point it will need no temps.
