Hi,
I am surprised that good old thing is appearing on 2.6 :-)
Hirokazu already pointed out some issues, and my major concern for
the code is that tar archiving mechanism is duplicated (embedded)
into the kernel directly.
BTW, have you looked at LUFS? (Linux Userland Filesystem)
I have not look at it closely, but it sounds it may help you.
Best Regards,
