Interesting.. here are the kernels I've tested so far, not including
the git-bisect run I did between 2.6.19 and 2.6.20:
2.6.17 -
2.6.19 -
2.6.19.7 -
2.6.20 +
2.6.21 +
2.6.22 -
2.6.23.1 +
Here a "-" means that the problem does not occur (my test program uses
100% of both CPUs) and a "+" means that the test program leaves one
CPU mostly idle.
Unless I've made a mistake, 2.6.22 seems like the outlier rather than
2.6.23. Is this inconsistent with the scheduler tick hypothesis?
Thanks,
