is there any idle time on the system, in steady state (it's a sign of 
under-balancing)? Idle balancing (and wakeup balancing) is one of the 
things that got tuned back and forth alot. Also, do you know what the 
total number of context-switches is during the full test on each kernel?  
Too many context-switches can be an indicator of over-balancing. Another 
sign of migration gone bad can be relative increase of userspace time 
vs. system time. (due to cache trashing, on DB workloads, where most of 
the cache contents are userspace's.)
