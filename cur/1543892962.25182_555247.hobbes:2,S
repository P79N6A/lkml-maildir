AFAIR git-quiltimport of quilt patches should handle this just fine?
My previous description of the issue was a bit too cryptic: besides
changing ide/ide-generic.c and ide/pci/generic.c filenames, ide/Kconfig
(names of config options) and ide/Makefile should be updated accordingly.
Also enhancing Kconfig entries for both drivers to be more verbose would
be more than appropriate.
Since I'm quite time constrained and I'm working on other IDE issues I
would prefer that somebody else handle this task and just send me patches.
