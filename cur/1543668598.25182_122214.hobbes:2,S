This (using swap as part of the tmpfs type system) is what happens on a Sun.
I was disappointed (surprised even) in the Linux implementations because
mounting a truly temporary /tmp was what I wanted it for.
I would like to see a tmpfs (swapfs?) that did presume that files not in use
(lately?) would migrate out of my valuable RAM and onto the super-cheap swap
device.
IMHO of course.
Rob.

I agree and I think if you add this option it should adjust to a
percentage of (ram + swap). With this it would be a really nice
improvement.
I even had patches for this but to do it efficently you would need to
add some hooks to swapon and swapoff.
