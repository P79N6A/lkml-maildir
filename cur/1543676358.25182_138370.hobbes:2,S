Hi Bart, Alan !
Ì noticed the reboot/shutdown notifier that is in 2.4 to standby the
disk is gone from 2.5. Is that done via other means or just missing ?
I added to my latest version of the blk PM stuff a request type for
REQ_PM_SHUTDOWN in addition to REQ_PM_SUSPEND & REQ_PM_RESUME to match
more closely the semantics of struct device, which means i can very
easily implement that standby-on-shutdown with proper locking & queue
issues in IDE using the exact same meacnism as suspend.
What do you think ?
Ben.
