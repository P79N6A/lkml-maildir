Hello
I am running into some problems with kmap_atomic in my driver.
My driver copies some pages coming from
user space to "kernel space kmalloc'ed memory".
I had this code running from 2.6.5 to 2.6.17 without any problems.
I have upgraded to 2.6.20.xx and this code fails to kmap_atomic.
I am running a uni processor 2 GRAM machine, 32bit.
Basically this is code does:
get_user_pages(page,...)
kmap_atomic(page,KM_USER0);
 .. copy and stuff
kunmap_atomic(page,KM_USER0)
I have also tried KM_USER1 and KM_SKB_SUNRPC_DATA.
I crash in arch/i386/highmem.c line 42:
  ...
  if (!pte_none(*(kmap_pte-idx)))
                  BUG();
..
To the best of my understanding ( from "see : understand the linux
kernel" page 310 ) , a different kernel component holds this window. A
fact which is quite strange in the case of KM_SKB_SUNRPC_DATA. I have
nothing that uses it.
1. Why kmap_atomic does not return NULL ?
2. Why am I failing only in high memory mappings ?
