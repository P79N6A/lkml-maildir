Hello Andre, Jens, all,
I have a problem regarding IDE drives. I don't quite know what might be
causing this, but the symptoms are as follows.
First, I initiate cdparanoia -B. It starts happily crunching the CD into a
sequence of .wavs. Meanwhile, I have a mpg123 playing something and /home
is NFS-mounted from a 2.0.36 box. Infrequently, the music pauses for a
second or two (other activity stops sometimes too). I also get
Jan 30 21:33:29 mylly kernel: nfs: server tupa not responding, still trying
Jan 30 21:33:29 mylly kernel: nfs: server tupa OK
in the logs. Normal operation is resumed once cdparanoia finishes reading
the CD.
CD-drive is hdc (on ide1) and the drive cdparanoia writes to is hdb (on
ide0). Both drives had initially using_dma=0 and unmaskirq=0, but changing
them to 1 didn't help. IDE config is:
mylly# for i in a b c d; do cat hd$i/model ; done
IBM-DHEA-34330
QUANTUM FIREBALL CR13.0A
IOMEGA ZIP 100 ATAPI
ASUS CD-S340
Kernel is 2.3.40-pre1, has happened since 2.3.20's on kernels compiled 
with both gcc 2.95.2 and 2.7.2.3. This is on x86 (SMP-PII to be more
precise). Anyone else seeing this? Something I can try to pinpoint what
exactly is causing this (apart from cdparanoia)?
More info available on request.
