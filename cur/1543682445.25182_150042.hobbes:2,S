the list.  Again I can't keep up with the list, so if Mr./Ms. Kletnieks or

Oh I see, two many people.  After fixing that, I see a list of
module-init-tools. Hmm, modutils-2.4.21-18.src.rpm is indeed newer

I guess it's just luck that Red Hat 9 had a sufficiently new modutils.

I have it configured as a module.  I guess it will be fixed automatically
when modules start working.

All except the DNS error, which came up again while I was checking out the
rest of this.  I don't think post-halloween will get here tonight.
