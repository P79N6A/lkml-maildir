functionnalities:
- allow to measure time spent by a CPU in a virtual CPU.
- allow to display in /proc/state this value by CPU
- allow to display in /proc/<pid>/state this value by process
- allow KVM to use these 3 previous functionnalities

Yes, like system time and user time are.

#ifdefs are ugly, I agree... I can remove them.
But "#ifdef" allows to save space and time (and it is not a beauty show).

Can you explain ?

Well... it provides the time spent by CPUs in virtual CPUs.
It is usefull only if you run Virtual Machine on your host (like KVM, lguest,
kqemu...) to know how many time your CPUs dedicate to virtual machine execution.
It's a good thing to have like user time and system time are good things to
have... do you use 'top' or 'time' sometime ?
