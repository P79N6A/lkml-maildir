Then you can put the CPU in C-state or lower P-state after (or even
during) your word processor displays the letter. Even you can type very
fast, the CPU is almost idle. Having frequent feedbacks simply provide
more chances to save power consumption. Then aggregate saving would make
a difference. In addition, penalty of making a wrong decision is cheap.

Even if you build a kernel, there are many opportunities for the CPU to
save power consumption without causing visible performance regression.
