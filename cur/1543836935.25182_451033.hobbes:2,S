I was somewhat-successful in building those up.  From my notes:
arm:
	eval `cat arm.dat gcc-3.4.5-glibc-2.3.6.dat` sh all.sh --notest
sh4:
	eval `cat sh4.dat gcc-3.4.5-glibc-2.3.6.dat` sh all.sh --notest
when you've struggled with crosstool for long enough, that'll become
meaningful ;)
fwiw, I've uploaded x86 binaries to 
http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/.
 
They're a bit flakey but seem to be good enough to get through a defconfig
build.  The main problem is fancy machine-specific binutils options which
are present in the kernel Makefiles but which stock binutils doesn't know
about.
