Since the log message is from your SCSI card, it would have been helpful 
to know what kind of SCSI card you have, and how it and the ES1371 are 
mapped in terms of interrupts.
It sounds like your SCSI card and your sound card are on the same 
interrupt, and the SCSI card isn't sharing. Perchance is your SCSI card 
an ISA card? If so, then you need to tell your computer's BIOS that the 
SCSI card's interrupt is "Reserved for legacy ISA" so the sound card 
won't be assigned to that interrupt.
