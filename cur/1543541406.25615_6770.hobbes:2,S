yes, the basic functionality works (i.e. for all practical purposes it is
perfect). If you need something exotic like locking then I think it is
currently on 2.4 TODO list as being merged.
Basically, I sucessfully ripped 3G worth of audio tracks, cat'd them all
together as one file and lame(1)'d them all into a single (much
smaller!) mp3 file. So it is safe to say - it just works. And I didn't
upgrade glibc or anything like that. I only upgrade the kernel (and all
other relevant bits like modutils).
