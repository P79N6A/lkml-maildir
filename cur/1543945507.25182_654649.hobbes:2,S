People, who do cleanups - I'm not talking about running lindent here -
read through the code while they fix it up.
Actually they find bugs that way or at least come up with useful
questions about code which is not obvious in the first place.
Discouraging such cleanups with a pretty offensive warning is
counterproductive.
