Hello,
My ide performance seems to have dropped noticably from 2.4.x to 
2.6.0-pre1...
the controller is an hpt-366, there's only one drive connected to it.  
It's on an 80 pin cable, and the cable is plugged in the right way.
hdparm reports that the drive is using udma4 (it's udma5 capable, the 
controller is not)
from 2.4.x, hdparm -t
 Timing buffered disk reads:  140 MB in  3.02 seconds =  46.36 MB/sec
and vmstat 1 while it's running shows

also,

under 2.6.0-pre1, I get

(this is a dual processor machine, so this looks to me like I'm cpu bound 
where I wasn't before?)
time dd if=/dev/hde1 of=/dev/null bs=4096
dd: reading `/dev/hde1': Input/output error
768088+0 records in
768088+0 records out
real    1m33.977s
user    0m0.967s
sys     0m26.695s
the input/output error is new too...
I also tried with everything in the Kernel Hacking sub-menu disabled, and 
got results from hdparm as high as 31.53MB/sec
Any idea what's wrong?
