But cdev_del also tries to do kobj_unmap before doing kobject_put. If
cdev_add fails the object is not added to the map so we shoult not try
to unmap it (although it does not hurt in the current implementation).

cdev distingueshes between stattically and synamically allocated
objects and so it is safe to do kobject_put/cdev_del even on cdevs
embedded into other structures.

raw.c seems to be DTRT.

The rule is simple - after cdev_init/cdev_alloc call kobject_put.
After successful cdev_add call cdev_del.
