Well, duh. Maybe they shouldn't be marked "inline", and maybe they should 
be marked with "__maybe_unused" instead. 
I do not think it makes sense to use "inline" as a way to say "maybe I 
won't use this function".
Yes, it's true that "static inline" won't warn, but hey, as a way to avoid 
a warning it's a pretty bad one.
