Hrm, somehow I don't understand it. On [1] you're
talking about gcc 4.1.2 and binutils 2.17 supporting
the -mcpu switch. But if you download the 2007R1 RC9
toolchain from the Files section of the site (tar.gz)
you actually get 4.1.1 without mcpu support. But the
version string from gcc indicates 07r1.
Care to explain?
Thanks,
Jan
ps: All in all it is a bit unfortunate to put features
    in the upstream kernel for a toolchain version just
    available from svn.
