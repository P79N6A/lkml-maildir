As I am probably one of the victims of these differing opinions, can anyone
tell me where to get a really-known-to-work aic-driver for 2.4? I am
experiencing zapping-black events while reading from a SDLT drive (writing to
it does fine).
Short hardware story:
02:03.0 SCSI storage controller: Adaptec AIC-7899P U160/m (rev 01)
02:03.1 SCSI storage controller: Adaptec AIC-7899P U160/m (rev 01)
Host: scsi0 Channel: 00 Id: 08 Lun: 00
  Vendor: IBM      Model: IC35L073UWDY10-0 Rev: S21E
  Type:   Direct-Access                    ANSI SCSI revision: 03
Host: scsi1 Channel: 00 Id: 02 Lun: 00
  Vendor: QUANTUM  Model: SDLT320          Rev: 3838
  Type:   Sequential-Access                ANSI SCSI revision: 02
Any hints welcome
Regards,
Stephan
