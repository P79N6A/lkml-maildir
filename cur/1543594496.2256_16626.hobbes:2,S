Al,
the pre2 didnt boot on the POWER3 SMP box. pre3 does (runs in 32bit
mode).
It could be a compiler bug because we have some trouble right now with
our toolchain on ppc32.
Right now it runs pre3 fine with a binary from the same compiler etc.
I have seen this only on that box.
Is it possible that a ppc64 writes some bogus values to the disk? I had
a ppc64 binary running but I wasnt too excited about it because it
misses some essential stuff like autofs. So I booted the 2.4.2 ppc32
kernel again with no trouble for a while..
