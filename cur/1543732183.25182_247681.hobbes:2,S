This indicates that the kernel is not able to find the root partition.
and that the kernel has already booted - most likely not a problem with 
GRUB.

Your partition table suggests that there are two different partitions 
for '/boot'
and '/'.  The GRUB loads the kernel from '/boot' which is (hd0,0) but the
kernel is unable to find the '/' partition.   You may pass it using the 
parameter
root=/dev/hda3.
That should work.
