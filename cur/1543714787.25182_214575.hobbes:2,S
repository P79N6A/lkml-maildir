That's right! I certainly won't run it before 2.6.20 or even higher on 
desktops. For example, 2.6 vanilla is much to slow (about 9%), even on 
desktops - tested with compiling. It must be fixed.
Another example: My production servers (a cluster system) are running fine 
and rockstable since years with 2.2.x.
