C'mon. Linus and you are not being paid for this but there are people out
there who make their living on selling Linux. Linux just for fun, that's
been quite a while ago.

As a service professional, I learnt to a) listen to the customer's wishes
and b) not arguing against them of, and c) to talk to development if my
product doesn't fulfil them. This is proven to work.

Which is exactly what Oracle et al. are not going to do - for obvious
reasons. This is not an "issue" but a showstopper. But you were kidding
anyway, weren't you?
