That will break functionality for the user, and sounds like a bug in
"mount". See my objection w.r.t. the user who thinks he is getting
secure authentication via RPCSEC_GSS.

The changes you are complaining about have *NOTHING* whatsoever to do
with NFSv4, which already has its own filesystem name (yes: it is called
"nfs4") with its own struct nfs4_mount.
The 2 changes to the NFSv2/v3 mount structure are as follows:
        int             pseudoflavor;           /* 5 */
        char            context[NFS_MAX_CONTEXT_LEN + 1];       /* 6 */
"pseudoflavor" adds support for the RPCSEC_GSS authentication flavours,
so that people can use it for improving NFSv2/v3 security.
"context" is an SELinux construct for passing their security context
information (whatever that may be) down to their private handler.
See? no NFSv4...
Cheers,
