I could trigger a lock up when loading gpm with my mouse on the PS/2 port
on my Tyan S1590S Super7 motherboard.  My fix was to "don't do that", I
just plugged the mouse into the serial port.  This was under the 2.2
series.  I haven't tried it yet with 2.3, but when I'm in the mood for a
lock up, I'll give it a shot.  I do have the PS/2 mouse driver compiled
into the kernel, I'm just not loading gpm on it.
