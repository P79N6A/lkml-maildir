If you are interested what usages and collections are (and if you are 
going to write the support for this device, you probably are :) ), please 
see 
http://www.usb.org/developers/hidpage
 - namely
http://www.usb.org/developers/devclass_docs/HID1_11.pdf
 and possibly also 
http://www.usb.org/developers/devclass_docs/Hut1_12.pdf

We don't want neither the 'Telephony' nor 'LEDs' usages to be claimed by 
the hid-input system, that seems to make a little sense. 
So either the device is bogus and has broken report descriptor (which we 
could fix in runtime), or it really can't be handled by hid-input (I have 
no idea about the purpose and internal working of the device in question, 
sorry).
Either we can fix the hiddev_connect() so that the device would be claimed 
by hiddev (*) and you can write the driver for this device easily in 
userland, or you could try to write generic in-kernel hid-telephony.c 
handler of all telephony devices (but I doubt this is doable in a 
reasonable way).
(*) I currently have no idea why this device is not claimed by hiddev 
though - it seems to have all collections of type 
HID_COLLECTION_APPLICATION which obviously are not IS_INPUT_APPLICATION() 
... could you please put debugging output into hiddev_connect() to examine 
why your device is not being claimed by hiddev?
Thanks,
