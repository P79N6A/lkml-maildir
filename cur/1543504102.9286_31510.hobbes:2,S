all patches I've seen do exactly the same - define HZ to something
other than "100" - it's all you have to do in order to increase HZ.
The differences are in how far they go to hide this change from userspace;
the common things being syscalls and '/proc' process/cpu info. There
are no compatibility issues (wrt eachover). (in fact i think all of
the patches do not change _anything_ unless you request a higher HZ.)

I'm afraid fixing some of them will take some time, as the fixes sometimes
are unobvious, require changes to apis and/or are controversial ;) 
[one problem, which i didn't see mentioned or handled yet, is: anything
 that assumess it can turn off interrupts for less then 1/100s. If you
 set HZ to 1024 the limit suddenly becomes <1ms and the chances of missing
 timer ticks increases]
