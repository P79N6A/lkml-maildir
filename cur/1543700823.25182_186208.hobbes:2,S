Unfortunatly my gladness didn't last long. The FAQ at
http://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/security/linux-privs/kernel-2.4/capfaq-0.2.txt
 
states that CAP_SETPCAP is disabled, but it doesn't say why it is 
disapled. That capability is needed by sucap to work.
So why is CAP_SETPCAP disabled by default?
