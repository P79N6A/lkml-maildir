Could be. I guess an easy fix would be to use an ISA display adapter.
It doesn't matter what the card is since there isn't going to be
a monitor attached anyway. I just happened to have two PCI cards
handy so I tried with them.

I know. The BIOS makes an awful lot of beeps while booting if there
is no monitor connected, but I disabled display detection from
the BIOS setup. It didn't help with the original problem though.

Like I said, I'll try that as soon as I can.

No, no, no. Looks like a lot of people have trouble understanding the
situation: LILO DOES BOOT, so it's _NOT_ the BIOS. Without a monitor,
I can hear the memory test tick and then the bootup beep. Then LILO
boots, loads the kernel image and decompresses it, but hangs after
trying to boot the kernel until I plug in a monitor. After that it
boots up fine. I tried with various configurations of 2.2.4 and
2.2.5. No change.
