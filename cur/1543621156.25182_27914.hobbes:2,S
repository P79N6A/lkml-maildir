I long time ago post about something wrong with the
optimization in the kernel 2.2.20 but it seems that
nobody got it. It is not the boot loader IMHO; You try
to compile it with i386 cpu Or try to add march=i386
in the kernel make file. 
I got the similar problem with 2.2.20 and I never be
able to boot it under 486 machine if I compile it
under 686 machine althought the 486 box has 32Mb RAM,
Finnally I have to modify the make file use march=i386
and choose cpu 386 type
