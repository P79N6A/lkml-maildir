	D'oh. And rmdir becomes what? Reserving blocks used for directory?
Not to mention the bloody layering violation you'll get here. Actually, I
like the variant with bogus inumbers having no connection with the
directory entries (see posting from Linus). FAT doesn't have hardlinks,
so...

	You'll get bloody unpleasant rmdir with that startegy. And lots of
nasty code (look through fs/nfs/dir.c for silly_rename() and friends).
	We have two ugly kludges: NFS rename scheme and NCPFS bogus
inumbers. None of them is really supported by VFS. Neither is inumber
changing. BTW, thread re open by inode IMHO indicates that something is
missing in the whole i_ino/fhandle/st_ino thing. Maybe we are mixing
different thing together just because they are mixable on normal
filesystems.
	Supporting bogus inumbers trick is easier for now. Wish it was
2.1 still. We'll have to clean NFS stuff (and it includes knfsd) in 2.3,
but let's don't start it in 2.2.0-pre.

	Albert, while we might do so we also have MSDOS on hands. What
will it do with plain, old, boring DOS 3.30?
