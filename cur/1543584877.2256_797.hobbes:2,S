every process under Linux is assigned a *task_struct* structure which has
all the info about that process eg. scheduling, accounting, I/O and others.

Subject:  system call for process information?
Hello
I asked this question on kernel-newbies - no reply, hope to be luckier
here:-)
I need to collect some info on processes. One way is to read /proc
tree. But isn't there a system call (ioctl) for this? And what are those
task[], task_struct, etc. about?
Thanks
Guennadi
