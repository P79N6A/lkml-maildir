Where?
`grep -r preempt_disable drivers' points at one bodgy scsi driver.
`grep -r preempt_disable fs' finds two instances of per-cpu data.
`grep -r preempt_disable mm' finds three instances (wtf is vmalloc_to_page
trying to do?  Looks redundant)
`grep -r preempt_disable ipc' is empty
`grep -r preempt_disable net' is empty
`grep -r preempt_disable include' gets a few.
It's less than I expected, actually.
