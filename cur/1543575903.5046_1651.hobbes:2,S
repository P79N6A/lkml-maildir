Cool!
However, can you do one test for me? Do _heavy_ writes on kORBit-ized
box. That might show you some problems. Oh, and try to eat atomic
memory by ping -f kORBit-ized box.
I've always wanted to do this: redirect /dev/dsp from one machine to
another. (Like, I have development machine and old 386. I want all
programs on devel machine use soundcard from 386. Can you do that?)
