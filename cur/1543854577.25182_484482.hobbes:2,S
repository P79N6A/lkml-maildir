Yeah, I'm fine with this part.

Might be useful. Maybe we should add a "struct device" parameter to
gpio_request() as well, to allow platforms to associate pins with the
devices using them through sysfs? Or perhaps just to generate an
appropriate name (otherwise, each driver would have to generate a
unique string by themselves, for each device it controls.)

I think I understand now. I have to use separate bitmasks for GPIO and
port mux setup.
If gpio_request() could do port mux configuration, one bitmask would be
enough to trap all errors. But after reading the rest of this thread,
I think separating the gpio and portmux APIs is a good idea, so I'm not
going to try to do this. Although I might set a bit in both masks when
configuring a pin for peripheral I/O, just to indicate that it isn't
usable for gpio at all.

You're right.

Yes and yes ;)
Which is of course the source of all this confusion. I just had to
realize that the final definition of gpio_request was I little bit
different than I originally expected. This means that gpio_request() is
no longer _essential_ on avr32 (which corresponds nicely with its
classification as "optional" in your api proposal) but very nice to
have.

Agreed. I'll change this.

Ok, I'll drop the BUG_ON(). There's really no way to take the pin back
from the GPIO controller, as "gpio" is just one of three states where
the other two assigns the pin to a specific peripheral. Leaving the pin
configured for gpio seemed the best solution.
But I'm going to remove the port configuration stuff anyway, so it
doesn't matter.

I kind of like it too. It's a direct enough match for me.

Yeah, I will definitely do that, but I thought that was supposed to be
part of the portmux api?
