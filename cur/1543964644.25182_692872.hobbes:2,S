No problem. Well, as you know, it's just a base. We need more work to
solve the problems on the top of this.
I'd like to have a mechanism to register a hook called when a new pci
(or dma capable) device is created. It enables IOMMUs to set up an
appropriate dma_mapping_ops per device. It could also enables us to
simplify the IOMMUs code to initilize devices at startup (for exmple,
intel-iommu checks all the pci devices and creates a domain per device
if necessary).
I'll post an updated version against -mm. If people seems to be fine
with per-device dma_mapping_ops, then I'll work on further issues.
