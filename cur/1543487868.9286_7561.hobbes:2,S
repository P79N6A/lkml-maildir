	Because it isn't. Suppose we have 5 sockets - A, B, C, D and E.
Initial state:
*dummy
pushing A and B. Result:
dummy <- A <- *B
pop() returns B
dummy <- *A <- B
pushing C
dummy <- A <- *C
	   <- B
pop() returns C
dummy <- *A <- C
	    <- B
pop() returns A
*dummy <- A <- C
	    <- B
D and E are left out of the tree. A, B and C are in.
