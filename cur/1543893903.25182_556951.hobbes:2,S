Suggest one.

Go ahead, submit a patch. It won't be that trivial. And i wonder
if it is actually worth the hassle. This is a debugging facility.

We have "echo c > /proc/sysrq-trigger" also.
This is a debugging option, and forcing users to recompile the kernel just
to debug suspend problems (not resume problems, the "it does not even go to
sleep" stuff is where this matters most) is IMO a bad idea.
We can also make this a boot parameter, i don't care, but i want to disable
console suspend without recompiling the kernel.
