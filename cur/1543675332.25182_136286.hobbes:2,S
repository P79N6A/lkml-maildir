Hi, all
I am not really sure if this is the same problem which I suffer from. But at 
least it sounds like it is.
In my case I get total system freeze up every time I copy something from fs to 
another and I have xawtv running. system is freezed up totally, no mouse 
movement, no response to keyboard, hd activity light is lit and constantly 
burning but nothing happens. First I thought that it could be a fs problem 
but I have tested all kinds of combinations. 
ext2->ext2
ext2->ext3
ext3->ext3
ext3->reiserfs
reiserfs ->reiserfs
xfs->xfs 
etc. 
everytime with same results, hds are changed, mb is changed, nothing helps. I 
cannot actually go back in kernel since 2.4.21-pre3 was first kernel which 
works with my new motherboard. I dont remember when this started to happen. I 
also suspected that It might be somekind pause problem so I left my system to 
finish its copy process. but after 2 days I resetted computer an no files 
were moved. Some progress has happened since now sound from bttv comes out 
even system is freezed. some times ago the sound was freezed too.

everything else but ethernet controller and bt878 has changed. 
I get random freezes if I read or write to one fs and I use my bt878. 
This has been problem quite long time now and I first suspected something else 
than kernel long time but I ruled them out one by one. Currently running with 
2.4.21-rc6.
