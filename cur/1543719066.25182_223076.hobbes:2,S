Actually, the do_wp_page() one doesn't change the page, but it potentially
changes _three_ bits: accessed, dirty _and_ writable.
But the fix on ppc64 should be to add the writable bit to the mask of 
things, and rename the function to reflect that fact.

I agree on the renaming, but please don't use the ptep_clear_flush() in 
do_wp_page(), because it really isn't changing the virtual mapping, it's 
only a (slightly) extended case of the same old "set another bit".
