I run at least 12+ machines with a similar configuration(Tyan S2466
dual athon w/3ware controllers). And I have been testing heavy loads
with them for over a year and not seen anything related to what you describe.
But, I do not use NatSemi network cards, mostly Broadcom Gbit
cards(tg3 driver) and some intel e1000 Gbit cards.  Maybe the problem is
your network card ?
