eeek, ia32 just lost another two page flags.
This stuff needs to be controlled by per-arch and per-subarch header files.
Instead of going backwards like this we'd like to actually free up _more_
bits in page->flags.  The worst (and controlling) case is on 32-bit NUMA:
eight nodes, three zones per node.  That's five bits, leaving us 27 page
flags.
So we'd need
	include/asm-foo/zonestuff.h:
	#define ARCH_MAX_NODES_SHIFT	3	/* Up to 8 nodes */
	#define ARCH_MAX_ZONES_SHIFT	2	/* Up to 4 zones per node */
and all the mm.h/mmzone.h constants use those two.
I think.  We could just say "dang numaq needs five bits", so:
	#if BITS_PER_LONG == 32
	#define ZONE_SHIFT 5
	#else
	#define ZONE_SHIFT 10
	#endif
Bit sleazy, but I think that would suffice.
