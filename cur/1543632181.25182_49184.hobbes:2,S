   I fixed this endianness mess some time ago, patch is included in 2.5.x
   but for some reason not in 2.4.x, although Andre was informed about
   problem and send patch ...
I encourage you to resubmit this when 2.4.20-preX begins.
2.4.19-preX is a long time going already, no need to delay
it further.  I've sent the simple Sparc fix to Marcelo for
now.
