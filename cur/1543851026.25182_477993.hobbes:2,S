Do you really think I have to explain anything with my replies? I was
just trying to help you telling where I found the answer.
Anyway, isn't it explained in LDD3? isn't it stated in LDD3? I think
it is (yep, not deeply, but enough: other books cover that points
better and a device driver programmer doesn't have to know about
implementations, right?). Sure, neither the book or I didn't know
about the VM_PFNMAP change, but that doesn't change that I was trying
to encourage you to read such chapter, the same way I found the answer
there.

And I still say I tried it, many ways, using remap_pfn_range() and
other weird things also. Finally, I thought something was wrong, so I
read LDD3 and I found the explanation about why my code mmap couldn't
mmap RAM. Also, my area was full of zeros, as LDD3 states. So I read a
little further and I did what "Remapping RAM" explains.
Anything else?
