	This affects one specific mode (balance-alb) in one specific
case (moving MAC addresses around, which happens during failover or
initialization), and a full fix is more complicated than just a switch
to work queues, although that is part of the full fix.  There are three
things going on: calls to sleeping functions with locks held, the same
calls from the timer context, and rtnl hold issues.
	The actual functions affected are various things called by
notifier NETDEV_CHANGEADDR callbacks started by dev_set_mac_address() as
well as some of the driver level set_mac_address functions that may
sleep.
	Andy Gospodarek <andy@greyhouse.net> and I have been working
jointly on a two phased fix for these problems: he's working up the
short term fix, which includes the changeover to workqueues, and I've
been working on the long term fix, which involves refactoring the
bonding link monitoring and failover system.  Jaroslav's patch looks to
be a subset of the patch Andy is working on.
