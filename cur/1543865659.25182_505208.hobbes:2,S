Subject: [PATCH] [DLM] saved dlm message can be dropped
dlm_receive_message() returns 0 instead of returning 'error'.  What would
happen is that process_requestqueue would take a saved message off the
requestqueue and call receive_message on it.  receive_message would then
see that recovery had been aborted, set error to EINTR, and 'goto out',
expecting that the error would be returned.  Instead, 0 was always
returned, so process_requestqueue would think that the message had been
processed and delete it instead of saving it to process next time.  This
means the message (usually an unlock in my tests) would be lost.
