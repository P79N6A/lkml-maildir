The problem is that there are already 5-6 different incompatible system calls 
with either different numbers or different semantics in significant 
deployment in the wild. EA/ACLs is an important feature for
samba servers so they are rather popular. While it's IMHO ok to do limited
testing in private the critical threshold where incompatible system call
ABIs are just a big problem for linux has long been surpassed. 
One of the success linux/i386 had in the past was to maintain a very stable
kernel ABI, but at least in the EA space this archivement is currently
getting undermined badly.
