Good.

First of all, let me quote mount(8):
---------------------------------------------------------------------
       The programs mount and umount maintain a list of currently
       mounted file systems in the file /etc/mtab.  If  no  argu­
       ments  are given to mount, this list is printed.  When the
       proc filesystem is  mounted  (say  at  /proc),  the  files
       /etc/mtab and /proc/mounts have very similar contents. The
       former has somewhat more information, such  as  the  mount
       options  used,  but is not necessarily up-to-date (cf. the
       -n option below). It is possible to replace /etc/mtab by a
       symbolic  link  to  /proc/mounts,  but some information is
       lost that way, and in particular  working  with  the  loop
       device will be less convenient. Also, pathnames containing
       spaces are handled correctly by /etc/mtab but not (yet) by
       /proc/mounts.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Your web page misses the loop device info.
Another point of difference is the name of the root device.
/proc/mounts has /dev/root, while /etc/mtab usually has
whatever was listed for / in /etc/fstab.
For some applications it is important to get the name of the
root device right. (I wrote a mount_guess_rootdev.c found in
the latest util-linux (2.10p), but not yet used because the
information in /etc/fstab is normally better.)
2.4 allows us multiple mounts of the same filesystem.
This means that umount currently is broken since it will
remove all entries for a (device,mountpoint) pair, while
it should remove only the last one.
Here /proc/mounts show the actual state of affairs.
2.4 allows us to remount (bind) subtrees at different points.
Here /proc/mounts is broken.
(The command "mount --bind /home/aeb /mnt" yields a line
	/home/aeb /mnt ext2 rw,bind 0 0
in /etc/mtab, and a line
	/dev/hdb7 /mnt ext2 rw 0 0
in /proc/mounts.)
So far about the current status.
Backporting my 2.4 mount patch to 2.2 is a good idea.
Also removing the 1-page limit is just a triviality.
But before doing more extensive things, we might wait a bit and see
what happens with 2.4. The new mount stuff allows people to build
immensely complicated mount structures. No doubt this has security
implications, and probably security conscious stuff will have to be
partially rewritten. I could imagine that we'll discover the need
for new system calls, maybe mtable(), or mstat() to find out about
the mount status of a file or directory. No design exists as yet.
