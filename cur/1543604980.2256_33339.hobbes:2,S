Yes this is the goal. At the office we have many developpers doing various
projects. They often have to setup special demos and those demos must be
located in our dmz. So until now, we could not give them root password. This
was kind of annoying (It is always annoying to refuse the root password to
a friend). Now we can do it.
But I suspect many ASP will use this. For now to make the box really robust
we need to enhance the schedular (some fairness) and make the user
resource global to a vserver. For now, you can limit a process (ulimit) and the
number of process a user can start, but you have little control over total
limits used by a user or vserver (right ?, maybe 2.4 has something in this area
I have missed)

Highly. Bug pending.
The concept is both very simple and sound
	security ID to isolate processes (an integer)
	chroot to isolate the files
	capabilities to lower the ability of root (I had to enhance that
	a little with the capability ceiling)
	set_ipv4root to tie all processes in a vserver to one IP.
The "bug pending" means that I may have forgotten one place in the kernel.
For example, when I implemented the new_s_context, I patchs the kill system
call in few places, then later I realized the ptrace syscall was an issue. I added
a one line test there. I may have forgotten one check.
The same applies to capabilities. When we moved from suser() to capable() we may
have forgotten something. Since capabilities are not that much used, some place
may be missing. For example /proc/sys was writtable by root and not protected
by any capabilities.
But the changes in the kernel a trivial. This is why I am posting here to
get some review.
