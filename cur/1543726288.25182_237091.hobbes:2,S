Well, at this point, I've 'shotgunned' just about everything.  Mobo, 
cpu, memory and psu now.    And a fresh ATI (Xtacy made) 9200SE video 
card, the old nvidia failed and apparently compromised something on 
the old Biostar M7VIB mobo as it was going.  Its now a Biostar 
M7NCD-Pro, with a 2800XP athlon replaceing the 1400XP on the old 
board.   The new memory, 2 sticks of 512Mb, is DDR400 rated.  And I 
just built, and am booted to, 2.6.7.  I'll see how long it stays up.
And despite all this trouble, I'm once again slowly climbing in the 
seti@home ranks :-)
