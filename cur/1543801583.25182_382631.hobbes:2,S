ccw_driver should be easy: Just don't set ->probe and ->remove in
ccw_driver_register() and move ccw_device_remove() and
ccw_device_probe() to the bus type.
css_driver needs some wrapper functions added, since
io_subchannel_{probe,remove,shutdown} are really specific to I/O
subchannels.
I'll see what I can put together when I'm back at work next week.
