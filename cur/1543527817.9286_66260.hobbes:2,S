 -fno-builtin in all cases gets my vote.  reliance on built-in
(implicit) prototypes is a dangerous practice, reminiscent of the 'bad
old days' of K&R C.  Think of all the portability and compiler version
issues here....  
 If one wishes a specific thing to happen in their program, one should
generally provide specific directions, thus reducing the chance the
compiler might provide 'surprising' alternatives..
 ...just a friendly opinion
