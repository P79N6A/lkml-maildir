Chris,
I reported the same thing on 11/19/00, whether this is a feature or bug for
2.4.X was not determined.  Was this behavior intentionally changed and why?
Looks like 2.2.X gives ECONNREFUSED, but 2.4.X doesn't and times out.

----------------------------------------
       I had occasion to "telinit 1" today and found that it took a long time
       to login after root passwd was entered.  this doesn't happen with 2.2.X
       kernels.
       Is this to be expected with the 2.4 series kernels? or a bug?
