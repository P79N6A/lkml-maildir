So describe what are the requirements (constraints)?
Above example has exactly one syscall in the chain, so it is ok, but
generally it is not correct.
So instead there will be 
s = atom_create_and_add(__NR_stat, path, stat, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);
atom then can be freed in the glibc_async_wait() wrapper just before
returning data to userspace.
There are millions of possible ways to do that, but what exactly one
should be used from your point of view? Describe _your_ vision of that path.
Currently generic example is following:
allocate mem
setup complex structure
submit syscall
wait syscall
free mem
the first two can be hidden in glibc setup/startup code, the last one -
in waiting or cleanup entry.
Or it can be this one (just an idea):
glibc_async_stat(path, &stat);
int glibc_async_stat(char *path, struct stat *stat)
{
	struct pthread *p;
	asm ("movl %%gs:0, %0", "=r"(unsigned long)(p));
	atom = allocate_new_atom_and_setup_initial_values();
	setup_atom(atom, __NR_stat, path, stat, ...);
	add_atom_into_private_tree(p, atom);
	return async_submit(atom);
}
glibc_async_wait()
{
	struct pthread *p;
	asm ("movl %%gs:0, %0", "=r"(unsigned long)(p));
	
	cookie = sys_async_wait();
	atom = search_for_cookie_and_remove(p);
	free_atom(atom);
}
Although that cruft might need to be extended...
So, describe how exactly _you_ think it should be implemented with its
pros and cons, so that systemn could be adopted without trying to
mind-read of what is simple and good or complex and really bad.
