I have no problem with this.  Keeping the names in all caps rings
"preprocessor define" to me, which in fact they are - but only insomuch
as they point to a real variable.  So I dislike that.
Personally I like them as normal variable names... don't you do the same
in the VM code as well?  But tune_foo is fine..
