Joe,
I continue to see the same issues with the resync patch in -mm.  For me,
tapping stops working, and I'm now seeing both the mouse pointer jumping
 as well (a lesser issue for me, so it was probably present earlier as
well).
I switched to using the synaptics X driver as recommended by Dmitry
Torokhov (
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/11/25/130
), and that has worked
splendidly for me.  However, that's really just a band-aid, and I'd be
happier with a working resync patch.

Same issue for me as well.
