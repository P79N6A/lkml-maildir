I'm a kernel programmer. I'm not an objective tester.
It also happens to be the case that I personally have never encountered
a performance problem with any of the schedulers, mainline included, on
any system I use interactively. So my "user experience" is not valuable.

This doesn't really fit in with anything I'm aware of.
