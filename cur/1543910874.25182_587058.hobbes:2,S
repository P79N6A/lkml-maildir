Subject: [RFC][PATCH -mm 0/4] Hibernation: Arbitrary boot kernel support on x86_64
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hi,
The following patches make it possible to restore a hibernation image with the
help of a kernel different from the image one.
The first patch adds the generic, platform independent code needed for that.
The second patch implements the idea on x86_64 and the two remaining patches
are generalizations.
Details in the changelogs, comments welcome.
Greetings,
Rafael
