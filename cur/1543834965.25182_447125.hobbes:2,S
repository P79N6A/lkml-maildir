I'm sorry for saying it that directly, and this is not meant against you 
personally:
Your statement is a good example why this data is worse than having no 
data.
As I already said in this thread:
<--  snip  -->
You are able to say that based on klive data, reiser4 has at least 
35 users in the world.
But you can not tell based on klive data whether the ratio of 
reiser4:ext3 users in the world is more like 1:5, 1:500 or 1:50000.
<--  snip  -->
I can't prove that the 1:5 ratio is wrong, but the point is that 
claiming a 1:5 ratio was true based on the klive data is not better than 
claiming it based on no data. But claiming it based on the klive data is 
worse since people like you are getting the wrong impression it was 
based on data that would have the quality for supporting such a 
statement.
The data simply has not the quality for such a statement.
Please read my two examples in [1] if you want to get an impression why 
such problems can occur.
