I have to admit that I call in the teen reserves to actually get good 
feedback on games, but I do watch a fair number of videos and under high 
load I find sd acceptable and cfs totally smooth. The next time my game 
expert comes to visit I'll get some subjective feedback. My use of 
glxgears was mainly intended to use something readily available, and 
which gave me the ability to make both subjective and objective evaluations.
My -ck2 results certainly show no significant difference from sd-0.48, I 
suspect that on a machine with less memory the swap reload would be more 
beneficial.
