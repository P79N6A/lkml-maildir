How about taking the idea a bit further and have two active versions. Eg: 
now 2.6.11 is out, new changes go into a 2.6.13 series. Any changes to make 
2.6.11 (more :) stable go into a 2.6.12 series which is 
stability/security/whatever improvements rather than devel work.
This way you can shorten the length of the time the odd series spends in -rc 
and can spend more time accepting patches rather than having long periods 
where developers queue them. Distributors are encouraged to use the even 
numbers including the even -rc versions and to give feedback as to what 
stability/whatever patches need adding to the even series to keep them 
happy.
Just an idea...
Regards,
Richard
