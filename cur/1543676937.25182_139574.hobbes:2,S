I don't think sysfs works like that (please correct me if I've
misunderstood, mochel..)
Look in /sys/bus/pci/devices/  There you have all the PCI devices
lumped together in one place, and we obviously need the domain number
in the name.  I don't know where the 0 on the end of /sys/devices/pci0/
comes from, but if we could, I wouldn't say no to:
/sys/devices/pciDDDD/DDDD:BB:SS.F
or
/sys/devices/pciDDDD:BB/DDDD:BB:SS.F
(Domain,Bus,Slot,Func)
I don't think the extra level of hierarchy in your suggestion is necessary
or particularly desirable.
