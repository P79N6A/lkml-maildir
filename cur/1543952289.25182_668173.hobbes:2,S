I'm just compiling the intel_reg_dumper right? I don't have to recompile 
all of X to use it?

Ok, got that. I tried to compile and I found out I also had to install 
libpciaccess-dev, that's probably because I'm using the git tree and not 
the one that Ubuntu 7.10 uses. But I still can't compile the 
intel_reg_dumper I get the following error:
