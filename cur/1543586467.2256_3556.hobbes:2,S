[sorry this doesn't have proper References: headers, i read the list
off the hypermail archive.]
there was some discussion of whether the kernel should emit a
/proc/config or some such for purposes of bug reporting, but that
seems to be a lot of bloat.
instead, why not try to point to a canonical location for a config
copy (we already basically do this with ksymoops and System.map), and
instead have a /proc/config-hash which emits a (precomputed) MD5 hash
of the .config file it was compiled with?
this way, you could check possible configs (Debian for example likes
to stash a copy in /boot, like System.map) and also know if they were
the right ones.
the one problem that comes to mind right now is modules, which needn't
correspond to a full kernel .config.
anyway, my $0.02.
