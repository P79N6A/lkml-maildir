Hi all,
    Here is the solution needed to get kernel v2.2.15pre3/pre5 etc to
boot and finish downloading the instructions on the Adaptec 2940U2W
with AIC7895 for NArrow Channel B. I'll mention also what I did to
get this value. I'd like to make a suggestion also in conclusion too.
A). Change the udelay(50) in the function aic7xxx_download_instr()
    to the following values to find the magic number. I tried the
    following:
    all 0's
    all 1's
    all 5's
    all 15's
    all 25's
    all 50's
    all 1500's
    The above didn't work.
  Next  removed all the udelays except last one and changed it to
udelay(15) to be like linux 2.2.13.
  Next  commented out all the udelays()
     The above two configs didn't work.
B). I then put a printk(KERN_INFO "message");  into the beggining of this 
     aic7xxx_download_instr() to see what was going on and found out
     that it wasn't calling this function for NARROW CHANNEL B. Thus,
     no matter what value that udelay() would have had, it wouldn't
     do any good.
C).  I then put alot of printk(KERN_INFO "message"); into this driver
     to find out where it was getting hung. The printk's were put
     in functions configure_termination() after the "Cables present"
      and in the function aic7xxx_register(). It then BOOTED!!!!
      Thus printk's put enough delay somewhere to make it boot.
      Therefore, the solution is to permanently :) put printk's
      into the source code driver. This is undesirable, see item (D)
D).   I then went one by one to find out which printk() made it work.
      However, when it crashed it was getting stuck on the
aic_outb(p,0,SCSIRATE)  function in aic7xxx_register() before looking
at the information that the board or BIOS left us comment.
        The printk() in the function configure_termination() that
        is in this section of code,
		.....
		aic_outb(p, sxfrctl12, SXFRCTL1);
		write_brdctl(p,brddat);
		printk(KERN_INFO "works when this message is here");
		release_seeprom(p);
		.....
E).   The next thing was to find the minimum udelay value to put
      in place of this printk() function.
       It was determined that a udelay(35) or greater would make
       this kernel 2.2.15pre5 boot.
       SUGGESTION:  Put a udelay(50) here instead to be on the safe
		    side so that it isn't on the *edge* of a timing
		     problem.
       I also tried mdelay(1) too and it booted.
F).  I also copied aic7xxx.c from the linux 2.2.13 kernel in place
      of this driver and I was able to boot linux 2.2.15pre5 too!
CONCLUSION:
      a. Is it possible to detect some register flag from the SCSI
         card and break out on that when it goes high vs. guessing
         a udelay() values?
      b. Is it possible to put a udelay(5) in the aic_inb() and aic_outb()
         functions so that anytime the function(s) are called they all
         get the same delay. Thus, one could remove all the udelay()
	 thoroughout the driver.
         Moreover, change the udelay(1) to udelay(5) in the functions
	  read_brdctl() and write_brdctl() too.
     c. With the above udelay(50) fix, retest the 3940W Adaptec cards
        to see if the udelay() values that were added to function
	aic7xxx_download_instr() can be removed or set back to what
	linux 2.2.13 kernel had.  The reason I asking this is because
	this board series also got hung on download_instrs too and
	the above solution may correct it also.
	Anybody out there with this card to try out this fix and report
	back?
Well that's it.
Hope to see this fix in linux 2.2.15pre7 since it''s to late for
2.2.15pre6.
