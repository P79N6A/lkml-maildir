Sorry misinterpreted, a userspace console would be possible now, if
someone implements it we can use it, but I'm not sure a freetype
accelrated console is necessary for us to do everything else.

Yes at least a 2.6 distro based X should always work, I'm sure 2.4 DRM
doesn't work with new X in a lot of cases anyways as no-one tested it
at the time and it just got broken...

I'm not considering using knowledge from X drivers, I'm considering
using the X drivers, I don't personally care about things like X's
over use of typedefs and that sort of stuff, that is what I term
semantic, people who work on X drivers know X drivers, and writing the
drivers is the biggest part of any graphic systems.

I'm talking the recent secure thread that came from OpenBSD, we should
have no unchecked access to the I/O ports from userspace, even for
root or special graphics processes, MMIO needs to be mapped R/O to
userspace and accessed via either real DMA or pseudo-DMA mechanism in
the kernel. I don't think putting modesetting into the kernel is
sufficent to fix all needed uses for MMIO so I'd rather add a checking
mechanism ala what the DRM does now.
