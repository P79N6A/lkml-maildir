Yeah, Willy, and pardon a slight bit of sarcasm here but that's how we get the 
reputation for needing virgins to sacrifice, regular experienced girls just

This isn't APL running on an IBM 5120, so it should Just Work(TM) and not need

button is only about 6 feet away...  I get some execsize that way by getting 
up to push it. :)
