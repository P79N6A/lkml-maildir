I ageww it's a hard problem.  Right now there is massive pressure on
Linux application developers to add features to catch up with MS and
Apple.  This inevitably leads to bloat, we all know that efficiency is
the first thing to go out the window in that situation, the problem is
exacerbated by the wide availability of fast machines.  It's an old,
depressing story...
That being said it would indeed be nice if we had more tools to quantify
bloat.
