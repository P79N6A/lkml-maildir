Subject: fs corruption caused by memory module

I've experienced some problems with my new 128 MB DIMM memory module
that produced also a fs corruption:
Memory test at power up even the intensive one was always okay and
Windoz crashed only from times to times without an obvious cause.
Sometimes it was running for an hour without blue screens. So, for me it
seemed to be normal ... ;-)
After that I've tried other memory modules (64 MB and 128 MB) and there
was no problem at all.
The interesting thing was that this problems occurred only sometimes
(after 10-30 min running the system) using the new kernels (2.2.10) and
very quick (after 2 min) using the old kernels (2.0.36).
A safe way to get a kernel panic was to mkfs with bad sector check under
2.0.36 for a partion of 900MB.
So this might be a way to determine if it is really the kernel or a
memory module.
Maybe it helps people to track down this phenomena of fs corruption.
Bye, Steffen
