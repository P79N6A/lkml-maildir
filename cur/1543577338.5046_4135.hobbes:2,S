Your arguments are senseless.
The dcache aging is mostly useful with _high_ VFS load like updatedb in
background. The logic is the same of the VM aging (ask yourself when the VM
aging is most useful: when there's high VM load, like a `cp /dev/zero .` in
background, the updatedb is the equivalent of `cp /dev/zero .` but for the
dcache).  Without the aging the "referenced" cache would be thrown away as well
with the rest of the cache pollution, while with the aging the "referenced"
cache will have a chance to remain in cache. This is true for both VM cache and
dcache.  The higher the load, the more times your working set would been thrown
away without the aging, so the higher improvement you get thanks to the aging.
