ksoftirqd will not be switched to before the first schedule
or ret form syscall, when softirqs will be processed in any case.
So, wake up in this case would be mistake.

The _real_ problem is softirqs generated from another softirqs:
additonal thread is made _not_ to speed up softirqs, but to _tame_
them (if I understood Andres's explanations correctly).
