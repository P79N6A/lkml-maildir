Looks like this item can be dropped from the concensus ... ;).
I for one would recommend getting the hierarchy right from the
beginning.
Though I can appreciate that others were trying to "keep it simple"
and postpone dealing with such complications.  I don't agree.
Such stuff as this deeply affects all that sits on it.  Get the
basic data shape presented by the kernel-user API right up front.
The rest will follow, much easier.
Good review of the choices - thanks.
