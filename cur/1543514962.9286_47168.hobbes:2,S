Subject: panic when loading driver

hi,
I have written an SCSI HBA driver. This driver is compiled as a module.
When trying to load this driver using insmod, I get a kernel panic.
Details are:
Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 0007a1bc
current->tss.cr3=016cb000, %cr3=016cb000
*pde=00000000
This driver requires a large amount of memory for allocating various
driver. The machine has 32MB RAM. Just before the panic, the total
amount of memory allocated by the driver is around 8824 bytes. The panic occurs
when I try to do a kmalloc for some more memory.
What can be the possible reason for this panic? Is it that the system is
running out of memory? Or is the panic because the data structures are
not aligned, ie I have not bothered to align any of the
data structures.
