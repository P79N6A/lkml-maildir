Hey,
I've a problem with pci_alloc_consistent with Kernel 2.6.5 and memory >= 4GB on a x86_64 machine.
The device can't use the dma_addr which I retrieve from pci_alloc_consistent.
But if the machine has less then 4GB it works fine.
How can I prove that the adress I get from pci_alloc_consistent is dma compatible?
Should pci_alloc_consistent not be used in environments before CONFIG_ZONE_DMA32?
Is there a better way to get dma compatible memory since 2.6.1 (except using kmalloc and GFP_DMA, cause just below 16MB is not enough memory)?
I'm very appreciative for any answer / help.
Ciao Thilo
