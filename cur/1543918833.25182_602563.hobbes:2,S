Qutie frankly, this kind of "I'll tell you more when I'm done" is not 
generally a very working approach. 
If it's all backwards-compatible with the current Kconfig format, I guess 
it's not too bad, but historically speaking, the people who went off on 
their own and redesigned something from scratch have not been successful 
(and the CML2 thing is a good example of that).
Incremental improvements actually tend to do better than "redesign".  
That's largely true outside of computer science too..
