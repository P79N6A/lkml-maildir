IMPORTANT POINT:  The 4k-stacks code does *NOT* reduce overall  
available stack!!!  With the old code we have 8k of _total_ stack.   
With the new code we have 4k of interrupt stack and 4k of per-process  
stack.  This makes stack-overflows a _LOT_ more debuggable, because  
it's not a coincidence of high process-stack-usage and high interrupt- 
stack-usage.

I posted a list of links to the archives of various reasons a day or  
so ago, but for summary:
This helps for some NUMA systems because single pages can come out of  
a per-cpu pool instead of requiring global allocator locks.

One comment on x86-64 vs. x86:  There are restrictions on where in  
memory your process stacks can be located on a 32-bit platform.  They  
need to reside in lowmem, which means under certain circumstances  
your lowmem can get too fragmented to create new processes even  
though you still have a lot of available RAM.

Who is this "everybody" of whom you speak?  :-D.  Personally I agree  
that we shouldn't _encourage_ 10k threads, but there are existing  
userspace programs which do that, and I think we should support them  
as much as possible.

The fragmentation behavior and optimizations for order-1 vs. order-0  
_is_ significant.  You can _always_ allocate order-0 pages if you  
have any free memory in that zone, which is _not_ necessarily true  
for order-N pages. (even if N==1).  Also, I think some of the  
fragmentation avoidance attempts get significantly easier and produce  
much better results if all the kernel stacks are order-0.
