After an uptime of  13:34 under heavy load and no errors, I'm pretty 
sure your patch is correct. Is there a way to backport this to 2.6.18.x?
Just an off topic question, does anyone know why I get so uneven IRQ 
handling on 2.6.19-20 and almost perfect on 2.6.20-rc2-mm1?
Thanks for everything.
Pablo.
