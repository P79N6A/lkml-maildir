Alan,
bttv still doesn't compile in all cases. What is needed to make things work
is this patch from Gerd Knorr which applied cleanly to 2.5.48 and 2.5.49.
With the compile fix introduced in 2.5.50 there's one reject.

In case you want to try out what the problem still is, I've attached my
config for 2.5.50
Regards,
-Udo.
