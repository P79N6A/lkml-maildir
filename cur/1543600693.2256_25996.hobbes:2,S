1) you add a special case just for that, and you argued for ages that you
   don't want special cases in the blkdev close path and I agree on that
   (infact I don't have special cases except where strictly needed to be
   safe)

If you read my previous email completly:
	you make this special case you would be safe on that side).  But also

	the user may do O_RDWR open and not modify the device, and still we must

	not screwup a rw-mountd fs under it.
	^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
you would now know why even adding the O_RDONLY special case isn't
enough. I can rephrase it: the user is allowed to open(O_RDWR), to only
read(2) and not to write(2) and still expect not to corrupt the
underlying fs. We cannot check all the tools out there to verify they
are opeining all the device with O_RDONLY when they're not going to
write to it. So if some tool is opeining with O_RDWR and never using
write(2) we shouldn't corrupt the underlying rw-mounted fs in my
vocabulary. I considered all this details while writing the current
code.
