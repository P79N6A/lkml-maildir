So the issue is two processes contenting on the zone lock for one node? 
You are overallocating the 4G node with two processes attempting to 
allocate 7.5GB? So we go off node for 3.5G of the allocation?
Does the system scale the right way if you stay within the bounds of node 
memory? I.e. allocate 1.5GB from each process?
Have you tried increasing the size of the per cpu caches in 
/proc/sys/vm/percpu_pagelist_fraction?

Could this be a hardware problem? Some issue with atomic ops in the 
Sun hardware?
