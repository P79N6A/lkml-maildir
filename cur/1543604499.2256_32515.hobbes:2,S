Alan,
Your fix seems to have eliminated the problem. I found this strange, as
the device ids still did not match mine. So I added a PRINTK line in the
test, and found that _with_ your fix it DOES NOT get triggered. The ac
kernel WITH the bug however DOES trigger the test. 
So, as I have tested both your and Linus' driver (in which the whole
"if" was missing), one has to conclude that both the bug in de ac driver
AND the whole missing line in Linus' kernel made the test succeed, where
is actually SHOULD NOT succeed. So actually my NIC is perfectly ok, but
not in combination with a workaround for a bug it doesn't have ;) This
was what broke things.
So, the 10Mbit half-duplex workaround breaks stuff on the devices that
do not suffer from the bug. This is dangerous... ;)
Anyway, I'm upgraded to 100Mbit now, and the bug is fixed, so I'm happy
:)
Thanx for your help.
Regards,
- Robbert
