due to the BKL. cond_resched() in BKL code breaks up BKL latencies.
i dont mind not doing that though - we should increase the pain for BKL 
users, so that subsystems finally get rid of it altogether. 
lock_kernel() use within the kernel is still rampant - there are still 
more than 400 callsites to lock_kernel().
