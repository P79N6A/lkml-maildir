OK, I'll send the cleanup patch.

I think this works ;)
This stack frame can't disappear until __put_task_struct()->...->free_thread_info().
So, if you have a reference to task_struct, then it it is safe to dereference
to_kthread(task).
Before this patch, kthread_stop() can only be used when we know that kthread
must not exit by its own. And with this patch we are safe in this case, note
that kthread_stop() does get_task_struct() before it sets ->should_stop = 1.
And this also pins the memory pointed by to_kthread().

This was not allowed, but now this is fine. Please look at the 4/4 patch.
But, in that case you must pin the task_struct after kthread_create(),
otherwise (with or without this patch) you just can't use this task_struct
in any way.

Well, this patch overloads ->vfork_done, and I agree this is a bit ugly.
But what you suggest (if I undestand correctly) is more complex, and doesn't
have any advantages, imho.
What do you think?
Oleg.
