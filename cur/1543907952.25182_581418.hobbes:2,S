Since the network device documentation needs a rewrite, I was thinking
of using basic html format instead of just plain text. But since this would
be starting an new precedent for kernel documentation, some it seemed
like a worthwhile topic for discussion.
Advantages of html:
  * basic formatting like lists, italics, etc
  * easier to integrate into other places and retain formatting
  * ability to link documents and to external sources easier
Downsides:
  * can become too formatted and unclear
  * accessibility and translation issues?
  * even more style issues
