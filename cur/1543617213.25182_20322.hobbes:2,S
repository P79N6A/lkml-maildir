Hello,
yesterday we came across another MM related problem. This time its related to
the bttv-driver. We do very simple things:
First load it:
# modprobe bttv
Jan 14 17:28:14 fred kernel: bttv: driver version 0.7.83 loaded
Jan 14 17:28:14 fred kernel: bttv: using 2 buffers with 2080k (4160k total) for
capture Jan 14 17:28:14 fred kernel: bttv: Host bridge is VIA Technologies,
Inc. VT82C693A/694x [Apollo PRO133x] Jan 14 17:28:14 fred kernel: bttv: Host
bridge is VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82C686 [Apollo Super ACPI] Jan 14 17:28:14
fred kernel: bttv: Bt8xx card found (0). Jan 14 17:28:14 fred kernel: bttv0:
Bt848 (rev 18) at 00:0c.0, irq: 16, latency: 32, memory: 0xef000000 Jan 14
17:28:14 fred kernel: bttv0: using: BT848A( *** UNKNOWN/GENERIC **)

[client=(unset),ok] Jan 14 17:28:14 fred kernel: i2c-core.o: client [(unset)]
registered to adapter [bt848 #0](pos. 0).
Then try to use it:
# xawtv
Jan 14 17:46:53 fred kernel: bttv: vmalloc_32(4259840) failed
... and exit of course.
Uh?
Interesting about it:
Does not work with 2.4.17 nor 2.4.18-pre3, but does work with 2.4.10-SUSE.
(Same setup, only booting another kernel)
Any hints?
Regards,
Stephan
