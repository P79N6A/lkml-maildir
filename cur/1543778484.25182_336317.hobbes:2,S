Subject: [PATCH 10/23] Use kernel_power_off in sysrq-o
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

We already do all of the gymnastics to run from process context
to call the power off code so call into the power off code cleanly.
This especially helps acpi as part of it's shutdown logic should
run acpi_shutdown called from device_shutdown which was not
being called from here.
