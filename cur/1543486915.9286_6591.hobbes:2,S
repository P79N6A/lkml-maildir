Linux Educational Needs Posting Pages
Hi all.
I am passing around a link to a new page
designed for the purpose of helping
LINUX move into the classroom.  Please
be kind enough to pass it around to
others in the LINUX community.
Linux Educational Needs Posting Pages
http://www.slip.net/~brk/linuxedpp.htm
These pages are intended for schools to
provide posting for their LINUX based
needs.  There is also a section for
volunteers to post contact information.
If a group or individual cannot
Volunteer, but can provide services at a
SUBSTANTIALLY discounted rate, you are
welcome to post as well.
Thanks for you help.
Bill
