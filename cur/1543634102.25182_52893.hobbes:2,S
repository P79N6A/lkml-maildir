Yes.

Yes, I don't know why I took that to mean that sg was displayed differently.

No matter the column position sg can be found if each column includes
the upper level name (sg, sd etc.). Then you do not need to know or
check the scsi_type of the template, or explicitly locate the sg
template in scsi_proc_map().
And then without the header scsi_proc_map() gets really simple.
