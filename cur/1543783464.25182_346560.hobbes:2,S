Below may not be directly related to the cause of the problem.
But I think some window sizes in your mail need to be re-evaluated.

Since the TCP Window Scale options are exchanged,
the window size field contains shifted value except SYNs.

I think the real window size here is 8192 << 2 = 32768.

I think the real window size here is 16534 << 2 = 66136.

I think the real window size here is 16534 << 2 = 66136.

I think the real window sizes are 15340 << 2 = 61360 and 2355 << 2 = 9420.
Hence, the right edges can be calculated as the following:
  84402527 + 15340 << 2 = 84463887
  84458619 +  2355 << 2 = 84468039
So, the window is not shrinked between those two lines.
Sorry, I have not checked other lines.

I think the real window size here is 2355 << 2 = 9420.
> As I mentioned earlier, I've seen it go as low as 181.
I think the real window size is 181 << 2 = 724.
