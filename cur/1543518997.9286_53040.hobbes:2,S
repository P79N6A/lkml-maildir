To get the max compatibility, CDROM-compatible drives need to present
themselves as a CDROM drive. So even if it's a floptical, which
normally present themselves as a "removable optical device", once it
has CDROM compatibility it will present itself as a CDROM to be
compatible with the large amount of thirdparty software that allows
you to do audio playback from CDROMs. (which on MS operating systems
probably doesn't use the right drivers)
