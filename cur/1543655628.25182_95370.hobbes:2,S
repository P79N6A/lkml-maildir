Yes, it is weird: I wondered the same when we did our bigstack patch
for debugging 2.4 stack overflows.
The conclusion I came to was, it was trying to start the stack somewhere
that wouldn't clash with where it's set up for the trampoline at the top
of the stack area, see in particular initialize_secondary(): was choosing
somewhere arbitrarily far below that.
To avoid mysterious magic numbers, I chose instead to start it immediately
below that area i.e. set the top esp here to the bottom esp there.  That
worked fine for 2.4, I don't see why the same shouldn't work for 2.5.
Whereas with your patch, you might be overwriting that area.
So below I've munged your patch into what we found worked back then.
To be honest, I can't quite remember my way around that stuff now,
and my words above may make little sense!
