That patch comes too late in the PCI init sequence for my machine. 
pirq_find_router() (where your patch goes) depends on pirq_table being set up by 
pirq_find_routing_table().  When I put in the debug statement in the attached 
patch, I got the "PCI: No Interrupt Routing Table found" message.  Since 
pirq_table wasn't set up, pirq_find_router() is never called.  Let me look at this 
some more (got vacation this week, so I can finally devote some time to this.)
