Is that always the case? - Or would it happen only if the ref count is 0?
I'm asking because I am currently writting a driver for a pci card (just
started) and if the module were to be swapped out when it was doing a
busmaster transfer I could imagine the computer crashing...I am sure this
would be the case with most modules providing important hwaccess system
services. 
Sorry if the answer to my question is obvious but I am fairly new to
linux kernel development. - Feel free to point out where I can find some
information about this...
Thanks,
