So in cgroup_unlock() [which is called all over the places] we first call 
cgroup_flush_deferred_work_locked(), then drop the cgroup_mutex. Then:

we drop the cgroup_mutex and start processing deferred work, then:

then we drop the mutex and:

clear the recursion flag.
So this is already a high-complexity, high-overhead codepath for the 
deferred work case.
Why isnt this in a workqueue? That way there's no overhead for the normal 
fastpath _at all_ - the deferred wakeup would be handled as side-effect of 
the mutex unlock in essence. Nor would you duplicate core kernel 
infrastructure that way.
Plus:

Why is the addition of work dependent on whether it's queued up already? 
Callers should know whether it's queued or not - and if they dont then 
this is hiding a code structure problem elsewhere.
