Can't speak for XFS, but the 4k stack issue was an option, and could be
investigated with care. I only found one case where 4k would repeatably
cause a problem, and the fix was in the -bk before I had a decent test
case. I am going to try XFS in a month or so, I have a chance to bench JFS
vs. XFS for an application with 40-50k files in a directory. Hope it works
by then if it doesn't now, I'm told BSD works well.
