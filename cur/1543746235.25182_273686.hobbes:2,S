There are already several things in filesystems that don't strictly
belong inside the kernel.  A filesystem could be implemented quite well
as a user-space daemon that sat on top of the block device and
communicated via sockets or shared memory just like an X server.
So, the argument that because it could be implemented in userspace that
it should be implemented in userspace is not automatically true.
