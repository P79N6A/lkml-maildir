I've only created coaster _with_ the suid bit while ab^H^Husing the 
computer to do other things--like compiling a new kernel. 2.6 is much
better at setting up DMA access to the drive; 2.4 would use huge amounts
of system time (> 90%). When that happened, the system felt like it was 
out to lunch--mouse cursor updates would sometimes take >2 seconds. 
Cdrecord used more cpu if it was suid. I haven't had a problem in 2.6.
The  warning is counter to my expericnce with cdrecord. I think the
warning would be worded better as:
"Warning: Cdrecord was unable to get exclusive access to the cpu."
"Warning: This may cause Buffer underruns from other activity."
and
"Warning: Cdrecord was unable to get exclusive access to memory."
"Warning: This may cause Buffer underruns from other activity."
But drop the first one if you're on >2.6.
