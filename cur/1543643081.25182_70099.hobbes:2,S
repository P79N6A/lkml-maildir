Your observation is right, but I'm not sure how much it will
matter if we start reading the file at stat() time or at
read() time.
This is because one disk seek takes about 10 million CPU
cycles on modern systems and we'll have completed the stat(),
open() and started the read() before the disk arm has started
moving ;)
