Then all SCSI drivers end up in the initramfs for the install kernel for
a distro? There might be _many_ devices configured that don't need to
reside on the initramfs.
OTOH, the initramfs will get built and populated by separate tools (just
like initrd is done today), so the alternatives would boil down to M/N.
_If_ the grand scheme of getting rid of builtins flies. I for one wouldn't
hold my breath.
