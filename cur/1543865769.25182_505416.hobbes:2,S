Actually, I have a few more -stable patches for both 2.6.18.y and 2.6.19.y, if
you don't mind holding off a day or two (wont have time to prepare these until
tomorrow evening)...  One of them is a security fix, that allows a non-root user
to hang the kernel given the correct circumstances.
Maybe you guys can make some sort of announcement before the -stable kernel is
closed.  I know that now that 2.6.20 is released, implicitly 2.6.18.y is
closed... but it's been a long while since the last 2.6.18.y release, so I
wasn't sure if patches were still being accepted.
