I did get the current 'pre' set of 2.4.35 (circa early
June) patches and applied to 2.4.34.5.  After fixing a goto
mislable in one of the patches (dont remember if it was one of
the patch-2.4.34.? or patch-2.4.35.pre5), managed to build a
vmlinuz-2.4.35 successfully.
Just wondered whether to expect an abandonded tree, in which
case I will fly with this 2.4.35 build or should wait for its
eventual release.
Thanks Greg!
