It looks fine in theory, but I'm sure it'll break with some anal ARP filters.
(so at least for 2.2 we probably would need to sysctl it, or teach lots
of users about prefsrc)
I guess Alexey would hate your implementation because it adds a 
unnecessary fib_lookup() in a reasonable fast path, it would probably be 
better to cache it in the dst entry and pass it in.
