The rationale is that after suspend the CPU has to be reinitialized.
That is because it is essentially like a reboot. All the previous
CPU state is gone.
It doesn't need to touch state in memory only -- if you want
you could create a new annotation for functions that only touch
memory; but I'm not sure it would buy all that much.
