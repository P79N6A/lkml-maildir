My primary concern was that of; why does the kernels own coding style
deviate from that advise given in it's documentation. Other than that
most mixed-case errors will be caught by the compiler, unless there
is an ambiguity with other mixed-case statements; which is probably
why that clause exists in the coding style documentation.

Certainly I would like to have a go at a patch, but I must say that I do not
feel particularly familiar with the code in question to make such a change.
I would have risen to the challenge had this been a driver level change,
but the mmu is something that I will not touch untill I feel comfortable.
I feel that this is a change that would be best managed by an experienced
kernel janitor.
