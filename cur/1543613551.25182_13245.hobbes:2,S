Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

  Hi, all. Version 199.5 of my devfs patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
The devfs FAQ is also available here.
Patch directly available from:
ftp://ftp
.??.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rgooch/v2.4/devfs-patch-current.gz
AND:
ftp://ftp.atnf.csiro.au/pub/people/rgooch/linux/kernel-patches/v2.4/devfs-patch-current.gz
NOTE: this is the patch that I'll be sending to Marcelo soon. PLEASE
TEST this patch if you use devfs, otherwise don't complain if there
are lingering problems. This patch should fix all known remaining
problems, including the devfs/blkdev races that Al Viro has mentioned.
This is against 2.4.17-rc1. Highlights of this release:
- Added clarifying comments in response to preliminary EMC code review
  (missed in ChangeLog in devfs-patch-v199.4)
- Added poisoning to <devfs_put>
- Improved debugging messages
- Fixed unregister bugs in drivers/md/lvm-fs.c
				Regards,
					Richard....
