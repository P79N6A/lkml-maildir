Hi,
I have a problem with the file /proc/<pid>/stat in the
linux-2.2.7-kernel
.
As I read in the documentation there is an entry for the time in jiffies
that the process spend in user- and system-mode. Also there is an entry 
for the time that its children spend in both modes. But if I summarize
the values of the (u/s)times from the children they are not equal to the
c(u/s)time from the parent. 
Can you help me with that problem ? Can I somehow get the values in C
without looking in /proc/<pid>/stat ? 
Thanks in advance,
Roman
