Because 2.4 is used on (real) production systems - even my desktop PC
on my workplace is considered a production system - which (at least)
should run and therefore trying 2.5 is not an option (and no, no way).
And then it takes 1.5 years for the next stable kernel release which 
implies that quite new hardware (without an existing driver) cannot be
used for any production-like system.
IOW you would just loose a lot real use and testing of backported 
stuff and new hardware drivers.
And no, I don't think that someone wants that.
