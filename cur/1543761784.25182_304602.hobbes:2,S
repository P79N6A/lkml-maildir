IDE drivers.
Since its a detail that varies widely depending on platform, the arch
should either provide it or at least have a way to override it.
linux/pci.h would be fine place for the "generic version arch overrides
with HAVE_ARCH_PCI_IDE_IRQ", or we could fix the asm-generic header to
not need #ifdefs in -your- source just to be usable.
