That's my problem, too.
There does not seem to exist any single set of test cases that
accurately predicts how the VM will behave with customer
workloads.
The one thing I can do relatively easily is go through a few
hundred bugzillas and figure out what kinds of problems have
been plaguing the VM consistently over the last few years.
I just finished doing that, and am trying to come up with
fixes for the problems that just don't seem to be easily
fixable with bandaids...
