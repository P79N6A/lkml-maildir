Venkatesh,
I could not find the definition for CLUSTERED_APIC_NONE. Is this an attempt
to set up the clustered mode right in case if it was not compiled with
CLUSTERED_..._XAPIC on the system with > 8 cpu?

In the systems like ES7000, all CPU (up to 32) and IO-APICs have 8-bit
hard-wired ID's according to their topological position. Therefore, the
apic_broadcast_id be has to be 0xFF (like summit's, I guess), and modes
should be clustered logical for Cascades, clustered physical for xAPIC. The
IO-APIC lines are programmed with the broadcast ID/lowest priority for
Cascades, and boot CPU ID/XTPR flag/Lowest priority for Fosters/Gallatins.
This is pretty much the only choices we have. If this is not what the patch
allows to do, we need a last chance architectural hook to be able to
accommodate our stuff.
Thanks,
