So looking at this the main thing for converting a filesystem is some extra
bits in the mount process and replacing PAGE_CACHE_* macros with
page_cache_*() wrapper functions.
We can probably set all this up trivially with XFS by allowing block size > page
size filesystems to be mounted and modifying the way we feed pages to a bio
to be aware of compound pages.

Does this mean that the -mm code will currently support bufferheads on compound
pages? We need that before we can get XFS to work with compound pages.

It's more drivers that we have to worry about, I think.  We don't need to
modify bios to explicitly support compound pages. From bio.h:
/*
 * was unsigned short, but we might as well be ready for > 64kB I/O pages
 */
struct bio_vec {
        struct page     *bv_page;
        unsigned int    bv_len;
        unsigned int    bv_offset;
};
So compound pages should be transparent to anything that doesn't
look at the contents of bio_vecs....

hmmm - what about the way we do copyin and copyout from the page cache? ie
we kmap_atomic() them before we access them. Does this need to change?

I don't think it will take much to get XFS to work with a high order
page cache and we can probably insulate the block layer initially with some
kind of bio_add_compound_page() wrapper and some similar
wrapper on the io completion side.

So far it's much less intrusive than I expected ;)
