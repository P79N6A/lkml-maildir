The initial UncorrectableError is the drive erroring the request due to
real failure of the drive to get the data. There are some races in the
base code when that occurs
rq should never be NULL at that point because after all there has to be
a request which has timed out. If the timeout isn't being cleared on the
error path that would make sense of the trace or if the timeout occurred
at the same time as the error completed it would have raced.
It could also be due to the fact base 2.6.10 will corrupt requests on
errors sometimes (which SGI now fixed)
