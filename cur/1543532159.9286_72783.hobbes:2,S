Yes, ifconfig -was- broken, I don't know if it still is, I would guess it's
been fixed.
I stopped using ifconfig and route ages ago because I had similar problems. 
I needed more granular control over the interfaces and routing tables than
ifconfig and route could give me.
My recommendation is to check on the latest version of net-tools, not the
latest that debian has.  I also recommend reviewing 'ip' as a replacement
for ifconfig and route.  Particularly when dealing with interface aliases or
quirky routing.
