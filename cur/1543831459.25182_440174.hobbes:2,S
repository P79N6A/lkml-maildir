Could you elaborate on this one a bit?  
I assume that there are rules that once i_nlink hits 0, it never goes
back up again.  It seems that a whole bunch (if not all) of the
individual filesystems do things to it.  Is it really necessary to go
into all of those looking for the places that i_nlink hits 0?  Seems
like it would be an awful lot of patching.
