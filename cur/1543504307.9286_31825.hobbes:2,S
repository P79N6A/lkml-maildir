Whilst one will probably need to identify the BIOS to determine
precicely how the CMOS is being used, one also needs to remember that
MOST of the BIOS's in use are generic ones that can be used with both
64 byte and 128 byte CMOS chips.

Personally, I'd see this as being along the lines of /etc/localtime
and the timezone stuff - have an intelligent default setting in the
kernel, and a separate userland utility that can change the default.
My choice would be to have the kernel part thereof split in two,
using something along the lines of the following...
 1. Do as little other kernel initialisation as possible. Only
    the stuff that HAS to be done before the RTC can be touched
    and the system clock initialised should be done at this
    stage of the proceedings.
 2. Read the RTC and initialise the system clock from it. In
    the process, store the current value of the CMOS RAM at the
    address offset corresponding to the mirrored RTC seconds
    register.
 3. Initialise EVERYTHING that hasn't already been initialised.
    This should guarantee that the RTC seconds register has
    been incremented at least once, which is the only guarantee
    that is required.
 4. As the final step in initialising the kernel, reread the
    said CMOS RAM location. If it has changed, assume the CMOS
    has 50 bytes of RAM available, otherwise assume that it
    has 114 bytes of RAM available.
 5. Start running the /etc/rc.d/rc (or whatever) scripts, to
    start up the various userspace daemons and what-have-you.
Comments?

Not about that part of the proceedings, you didn't. I agree with you
that the code to determine exactly how the CMOS is mapped into values
on a given system needs to be in userspace, but the code to actually
locate, read and write it needs to be in the kernel itself.

The original algorithm that I presented IS possible from userspace,
despite certain pretences to the contrary, but it needs a bit more
work than I've given it to date to polish it up somewhat...
Best wishes from Riley.
