We have about half of all the in-tree filesystems declaring
->setattr(), and out of those only two that we know would use this.
Others haven't commented, which proably means, they just don't care
about this issue.
And even if most of them would make use of this feature, a inode flag
or filesystem flag for a smooth and backward compatible migration is
just so much better than risking to break filesystems.
And yes, I'm thinking about in-tree filesystems as well.  I'm sure you
did a thorough audit of all filesystems, but we are all human and can
make mistakes.  It is _always_ safer to not change an API which could
cause silent breakage.  And IMO, that's far more important than the
beauty of an interface (and ->setattr() is not beautiful with or
without an inode flag).

Oh no.  I'd like less breakage not more.
