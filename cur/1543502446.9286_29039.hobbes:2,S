I've put some new stuff on our download page at
http://aerobee.informatik.uni-bremen.de/acl_download.html
including:
ACL patch for linux-2.2.10
ACL patch for linux-2.3.10
Bugfixes:
- remounting to enable ACL support works now, so also / can be mounted
with ACL support 
- replaced #include <config/ext2/fs/acl.h> with #include <linux/config.h>
- standard permissions are used correctly (again) if no ACL is associated with an inode
New patch for e2fsprogs, works with 1.14 & 1.15.
