Thank you for your reaction. Others on the list also said that with a
kernel compile, disk speed is a bottleneck, not memory. 
What is the difference between PC133-333 and PC133-222, and is that also
the difference between RAM and SDRAM? Do you have an url to more info
about this (and other factors to SDRAM timing)? TIA!
