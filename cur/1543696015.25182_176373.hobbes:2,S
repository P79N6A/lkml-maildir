Does "pci_map_page(virt_to_page(addr))" handle contiguous regions of
multiple pages?  It seems like the i386 implementation will (assuming
we're dealing with kmalloc'd memory).  Although the semantics of
map_single seem better to me than map_page, if I'm mapping a single
"region" of multiple pages.
