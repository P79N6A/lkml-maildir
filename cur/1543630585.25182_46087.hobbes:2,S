I did not see corruption on VIA KT133 (VT8363) + Promise PDC20265R in
non-RAID ("UDMA/100") mode with hda + hde. (No longer using the promise
because FreeBSD uses to talk Tagged Queueing on those old Promise
chips).
So maybe it's the newer chipset or it's rare enough it doesn't bite
everybody -- or it's infact a Promise incompatibility. (FreeBSD man
pages report Promise chips before TX2 lock up hard with ATA DMA queued
commands).
