Subject: 2.5.59-mjb4 (scalability / NUMA patchset)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/2/7/4

The patchset contains mainly scalability and NUMA stuff, and anything 
else that stops things from irritating me. It's meant to be pretty stable, 
not so much a testing ground for new stuff.
I'd be very interested in feedback from anyone willing to test on any 
platform, however large or small.

Since 2.5.59-mjb3 (~ = changed, + = added, - = dropped)
Notes:
Very, very boring ... just getting one (hopefully) rock-solid stabilisation
point for lots of stuff that's pending I have to merge somehow ...  
I've broken out the pidmaps_nodepages and 4K stacks patches that were
causing some problems ... will return soon. Available seperately (as above)
- thread_info_cleanup (4K stacks pt 1)		Dave Hansen / Ben LaHaise
- interrupt_stacks    (4K stacks pt 2)		Dave Hansen / Ben LaHaise
- stack_usage_check   (4K stacks pt 3)		Dave Hansen / Ben LaHaise
- 4k_stack            (4K stacks pt 4)		Dave Hansen
- pidmaps_nodepages				Dave Hansen
