Subject: 2.5.56 CardBus not accepting USB 2.0 adapter
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

2.5.56 CardBus is not accepting a USB 2.0 adapter due to
the infamous PCI resource collision problem.  This was
also seen in 2.5.54, 2.5.55. The card works under 2.4.18.
lspci has
02:03.0 CardBus bridge: Texas Instruments PCI1420
02:03.1 CardBus bridge: Texas Instruments PCI1420
dmesg shows:
cs: cb_alloc(bus 3): vendor 0x1033, device 0x0035
PCI: Device 03:00.0 not available because of resource collisions
PCI: Device 03:00.1 not available because of resource collisions
PCI: Device 03:00.2 not available because of resource collisions
Other people on this list seem to have problems with network cards.
I reported this on the usb devel list but apparently it is CardBus
b0rkeness rather than a usb problem.
Any ideas?
