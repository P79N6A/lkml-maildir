Actually, a -git bisection test is even easier, less work involved, and

Cheers,

P.S.: I apologize if any cc's got dropped.... I tried to add those that 
I know should be here, but the V4L mailing list hosted by RedHat adds a 
Reply-To: and drops all the cc's ...  I've been flamed about it in the 
past, and I complained about it on V4L list-- Alan Cox says this was 
intended, and nobody agrees with me that it should be fixed.  :-(  (this 
is my last word on the issue)
