Hmmm... A recent thread on PCI write posting seemed to confirm my view [1].
What am I missing here?

For i/o space it is ok as in*/out* are synchronous. For mmio right now I
don't know. I need to talk to Andre about that for SATA. I guess for the
PPC its going to be fun

There was some talking about hwif->IOSYNC() (for IDE). That might be
interesting for other devices, too. It could resolve to a nop for
synchronous operations, and say a read* for MMIO. IMHO it shouldn't be up
to a driver maintainer to figure out what sync op some arch the driver may
run on needs. What a maintainer typically _can_ provide is type of
operation (MMIO/PIO) and a register that is considered safe for a sync
read.
