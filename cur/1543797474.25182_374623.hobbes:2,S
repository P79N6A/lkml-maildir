Milton's comment for patch 5 was about the patch comment, I don't
think I can address that any more.
Here come updated version for patches 8 and 10, a fix for patch 3
and a number of other patches that have come up in the last week.
All patches apply on top of today's powerpc.git tree.
More patches will be coming to address the concerns of Al Viro
about spufs.
Thanks,
