You'll need to declare and use spinlocks on shared resources, such as shared
memory (variables etc) in your network card driver. When you're called in
the bottom half interrupt handler (ISR), you wait for then take the
spinlock, then do your work. Do the same in your other functions. Just try
to ensure the spinlock is held for a little as time possible, for more
scalability etc.
