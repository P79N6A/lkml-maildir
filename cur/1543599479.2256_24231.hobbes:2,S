hello, i saw that patch 2.3.9ac moves mount_sem from fs/super.c to
fs/namespace.c (it is devlared static), this has problems
with VFS lock patch that is needed fro LVM snapshots and journaled fs
which uses mount_sem in unlockfs()
I believe the best way to fix this is moving unlockfs()
to fs/namespace.c, but i am not 100% positive
what would you suggest?
