Subject: What's slated for inclusion in 2.6.24-rc1 from the NFS client git tree...
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/3/325

Aside from the usual updates from Chuck for NFS-over-IPv6 (still
incomplete) and a number of bugfixes for the text-based mount code, the
main news in the NFS tree is the merging of support for the NFS/RDMA
client code from Tom Talpey and the NetApp New England (NANE) team.
We also have the 64-bit inode support from RedHat/Peter Staubach.
There is also the addition of a nfs_vm_page_mkwrite() method in order to
clean up the mmap() write code.
Finally, I've been working on a number of updates for the attribute
revalidation, having pulled apart most of the dentry and attribute
revalidation into separate variables. A number of fixes that address
existing bugs fell out of that review, which should hopefully result in
more efficient dcache behaviour...
The NFS client git tree can be found at
   git://git.linux-nfs.org/pub/linux/nfs-2.6.git
or on gitweb at
  
http://linux-nfs.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=nfs-2.6.git;a=summary
Finally, a full set of patches may be found on
  
http://client.linux-nfs.org/Linux-2.6.x/2.6.23-rc9/
Cheers
