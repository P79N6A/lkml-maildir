Hmmm... any chance this could be split into a sys_sync_file_range and
a vfs_sync_file_range which takes a 'struct file*' and does less (or
no) sanity checking, so I can call it from nfsd?
Currently I implement COMMIT (which has a range) with a by messing
around with filemap_fdatawrite and filemap_fdatawait (ignoring the
range) and I'd rather than a vfs helper.
And in nfsd I call filp->f_op->fsync between the two.  Doesn't
sys_sync_file_range need to call into the filesystem at all?
