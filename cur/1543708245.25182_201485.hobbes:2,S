OSS-API emulation does not work properly in 2.6.3 with Loki's 
UnrealTournament.
When using kernel 2.6.3 with Loki's UT, the sound is too fast. This is 
_not_ an issue with 2.6.2. Both kernels are compiled with the same 
options - ALSA with all OSS emulation options enabled. No native OSS 
support is compiled in.
OSS emulation seems to work with other programs, such as xmms, under 
both kernels.
A workaround is to compile all sound options as modules, and modprobe 
ALSA out and OSS in before starting UnrealTournament. This is quite 
clumsy, though.
