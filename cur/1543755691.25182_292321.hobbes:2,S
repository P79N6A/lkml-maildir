Yes fairly sure. The feature has been a well known but non-documented
property of the tty layer since about 1.0. There are two ways I see to
clean it up - we
can have the serial driver behave like other drivers and if need be
known about
recursive entries or we could extend the driver interface with an "echo"
method used by line disciplines when calling back to the tty driver from
a data
receive event.
