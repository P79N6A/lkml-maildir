I've googled a bit, too. Unfortunately, I don't have much knowledge about
standards and who defines or changes them. Nevertheless it might help
what I've found in "
http://www.opengroup.org/austin/docs/austin_251.txt"
:
   XSH ERN 84 sigaction Accept as marked below
   Change from:
    This mask is formed by taking the union of the current signal mask and
    the value of the sa_mask for the signal being delivered [XSI] [Option
    Start]  unless SA_NODEFER or SA_RESETHAND is set, [Option End] and
    then including the signal being delivered.
   to:
    This mask is formed by taking the union of the current signal mask and
    the value of the sa_mask for the signal being delivered, and [XSI] [Option
    Start]  unless SA_NODEFER or SA_RESETHAND is set, [Option End]
    then including the signal being delivered.
Maybe, the standard already is fixed?
