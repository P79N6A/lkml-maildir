Subject: [PATCH] kill massive wireless-related log spam

Please apply to 2.6.14-rc.
Although this message is having the intended effect of causing wireless
driver maintainers to upgrade their code, I never should have merged
this patch in its present form.  Leading to tons of bug reports and
unhappy users.
Some wireless apps poll for statistics regularly, which leads to a
printk() every single time they ask for stats.  That's a little bit
_too_ much of a reminder that the driver is using an old API.
Change this to printing out the message once, per kernel boot.
