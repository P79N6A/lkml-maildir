I forced maestro on irq11, and it now works, but pcmcia locks up. Maybe
11 is not correct, but it just happens frequene enough for sound to play
back?
Ugh... Yep, if I hooked maestro on USB interrupt.... Of course that would
work!
Ouch, you said you have maestro on irq5. And does it *work*? For me,
it plays mp3 but repeats portions even on wrong interrupt.

Will patch below fix the problem or just print tables?

I'm afraid I'm not going to call HP, sitting in europe. Also not sure if
I'll be able to update BIOS, notebook is not exactly mine ("Trash anything
on the disk, but don't kill the machine").
