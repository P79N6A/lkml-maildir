Riiiight. This will not happen before 2037 unless we make changes now
that break the broken applications.

The time_t interface and associated functions _are_ that API.
Any program that uses them properly would need to be recompiled on the
redefinition of time_t, but that is it.

Correct.

See 3.

This should be step 1.

"all machines"? Step 5 should take care of this within 5-10 years
without further intervention with certain exceptions (Xenix equivalents).

Make the problem go away by 2020 and have a nice relaxing 2037 developing
new stuff that we haven't even concieved yet. Fighting fires this
predictable at the last moment is no way to run a project.
