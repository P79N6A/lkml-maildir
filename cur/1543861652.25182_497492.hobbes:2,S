It depends on what "the purpose of TSC" is.  The original spec is 
ambiguous if the TSC counts wall time or CPU time, since there was no 
distinction when the spec was made.  The more common usage, however, was 
to count wall time; the relatively few users who care about CPU cycles 
(especially when the CPU is degraded) can be serviced via an RDPMC counter.
I *definitely* support the concept that RDPMC 0 should could CPU cycles 
by convention in Linux.
