One more question then. Since ix86 instruction set is so easy to
support what takes up all the die space?
Also I still don't understand why chip designers don't design simpler
chips that behave like multiple processors rather than going to all
the work of having deep pipelines and all the complexity associated
with that e.g. speculative execution, out of order execution... 
i.e. Is there some reason they don't make a chip which is essentially
four 486's, cache and all the glue circuitry needed to make them
capable of running SMP.
