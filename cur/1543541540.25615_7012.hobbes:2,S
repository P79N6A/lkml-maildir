Yes, it's obvious that more work is needed here.  We can't offer these
patches as "solutions" with outstanding mysteries like this.
I modified `amlat' so that after every SIGIO it chews 80% of an interrupt
interval.  My approach was to just spin on the value of the TSC.  According
to `ps' it is amazingly accurate. Could you please take a look and let me
know if you can spot anything which can explain this?

OK, I'll take a look, work out what's going on.
