 It tends to work in the APIC mode all the time (with all systems), unlike 
the PIT which has "interesting" routing problems with its IRQ0, which 
you've probably already noticed.  Have a look at all the hassle in 
check_timer() if you want to double-check it.
 Of course using APIC internal timers is generally the best idea on SMP, 
but they may have had reasons to avoid them (it's not an ISA interrupt, so 
it could have been simply out of question in the initial design).
