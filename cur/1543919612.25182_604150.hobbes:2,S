I meant: if there is any reordering possible this should be quite
distinctly visible, because why would any vendor enable such nasty
things if not for performance. But now I start to doubt: of course
there is such a possibility someone makes this reordering for some
other reasons which could be so rare it's hard to check. And this
someone knows it's processors are seen less efficient because of eg.
mostly unneeded read barriers used by operating systems...

No, it's only about the comment to this patch: "Hence, smp_rmb() may be
a simple barrier".

Anyway, it seems any heavy testing such as yours, should give us the
same informations years earlier than any vendors manual and then any
gain is multiplied by millions of users. Then only still doubtful
cases could be treated with additional caution and some debugging
code.

After reading this Intel's legal information I don't think you should
feel so much more forward confident...

And they really should be!
