Briefly, our ES7000 boxes are non-NUMA, but use clustered APICs (logical
with Cascades, and physical with Gallatins/Fosters). Our code is pretty much
within the clustered APIC code (when both physical and logical are
implemented). Even with NUMA that is forced in clustered APIC case, we are
usually OK as a single-node case.
There are only a few problems with porting the Linux kernel to the ES7000:
	we use 8-bit APIC IDs - this makes us use APIC_LDR instead of
APIC_ID throughout the code;
	we have special RTE destination values on IO-APIC - the "if" in the
programming IO-APIC line code;
	we introduce severe IRQ override case - we remap ISA interrupts to a
different interrupt range (all the "i < 16" clauses).
Also, I usually have to add things like XTPR mechanism for Fosters/Gallatins
and disable conventional IRQ balancing, since our IO-APIC doesn't work this
way... (All of the above is in the SuSE code base).
I worked with the SuSE tree which has clustered code (at the first glance)
close to the patch being discussed here.
The 2.5 tree gives us a benefit of the subarch that will accomodate
(hopefully) our special cases. 
But I may need to add more hooks.

I will be looking at the Intel patch submited against 2.4 with support for
the ES7000 in mind. I am trying to get the ES7000 patch for 2.5.x out
sometime next week (my boss won't let me have a life until I get ES7000
support in 2.5 (:-<)). At the same time, we are very interested in any
clustered APIC patch that goes in the 2.5 tree (sooner the better).  Having
physical cluster support in 2.5 would greatly reduce the size of diffs for
the ES7000.
