I have not seen any consensus on any IPv6 mailing lists for this
behaviour, and not any reports on how other OS APIs work. IPv4-mapped
IPv6 addresses are a feature of the IPv6 API. If you don't enable the
IPv6 API, you will not be able to use its features.
A much more valid request is to enable IPv6 by default in the
kernel. I really hope that the common Linux distributions will
distribute their default kernel with IPv6 enabled. AIX is already
there, among others.
