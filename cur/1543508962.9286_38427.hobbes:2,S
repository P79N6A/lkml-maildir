I'm sure someone responded to this already, but this is complete bull. 
There has been no time that I am aware of that a new kernel has
been >RELEASED< to fix a security issue.  There has always been
>PATCHES< that were integrated into later kernel releases.  Correct me
if I'm wrong, and please don't consider this a troll, but this sounds
like complete FUD to me.  "Oh, we >CAN'T< put the new RAID in the
"stable" kernel because then we wouldn't be able to correct security
holes as they are discovered!!!"  Please.
