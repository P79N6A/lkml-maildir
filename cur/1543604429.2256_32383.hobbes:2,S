I must correct myself: I bootet a 2.4.7 instead and I had the same crash.
And there was one thing that I did that I didn't before the past months: I
did run "nice abcde" (abcde is a music -> OGG/MP3 program, that means both
cdparanoia and lame were running at the same time) plus one or more other
programs that cause high sytem load (this time it was an
"apt-get dist-upgrade").
