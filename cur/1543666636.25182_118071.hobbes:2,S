Okee doke. Will do.
I said I was going to use dynamically allocated bitmaps instead of page
flags. Do you mind if I do use pageflags after all (at least for the
moment)? I've used one in the generate_free_page_map patch, and need one
more to mark pages which will be saved in another pageset.

Mmm, but I will use suspend_task elsewhere and wanted to make the test
simple (zero = not suspending at the moment; since init will never be
the suspend task, it's safe usage).
