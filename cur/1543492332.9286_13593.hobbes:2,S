    You're not being paranoid enough.
    You've forgotten the users, and the evil management that forces you
    to let people break security on your machines.  Every machine on the
    local network is there for the sole purpose of breaking onto YOUR
    machine, and those dirty scoundrels won't stop until inodes are
    BLEEDING ON THE FLOOR.
