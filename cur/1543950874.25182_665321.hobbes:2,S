   Thank you for taking the time to look and reply to this.

   At the bottom of the above message there's a patch which is not currently 
merged in either the linux-2.6.24.y.git or linux-2.6.git trees.  That's 
perhaps as it should be, but I would like to know if it's worth trying 
merging the patch locally as an attempted workaround until such time as 
2.6.25 is released and stable.

   If I understand the above correctly, it sounds like the per-vfsmount is 
going to be a new feature committed to 2.6.25, but probably not backported to 
prior kernel trees.  If this feature was was added at 2.6.23.9 then if I 
understand corectly it's only an issue between that version and 2.6.25; is 
that correct?
   Thanks again.
   Cheers.
