Well well well.
Thank you Nate!
I changed that bit of code to:
	if (dirty_ratio > unmapped_ratio - 10) 
		dirty_ratio = unmapped_ratio - 10;
and added a couple of sanity checks so that it couldn't get below 5 or above 95.
Then set /proc/sys/vm/dirty_ratio to 95 and dirty_background_ratio to 1.
Guess what? Now my video streams for 120 seconds before being throttled. This is *much better*.
It's now quite feasible to reach 30 seconds by finding a faster disk and/or adding another 512M
or RAM.
I guess the hard-coded limit is in there for a reason, but I sure wish it was adjustable without
this sort of hacking.
regards, Anthony
