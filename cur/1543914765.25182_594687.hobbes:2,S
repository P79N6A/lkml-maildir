The latest sched-devel.git tree can be pulled from:
   git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mingo/linux-2.6-sched-devel.git
people were busy sending patches, so there's lots of updates since the 
first announcement of the cfs-devel.git tree four days ago:

the most user-noticeable improvement should be the latency/interactivity 
fixes from Mike Galbraith and Peter Zijlstra. The biggest (and most 
complex) item is the new group scheduler code from Srivatsa Vaddagiri. 
There's also speedups from Dmitry Adamushko and various cleanups and 
fixes. Also added in the yield workaround that should address the 
regression reported by Antoine Martin.
Changes:
- the biggest item is the addition of the group scheduler from Srivatsa 
  Vaddagiri - this is not configurable yet, it depends on
  CONFIG_CONTAINERS. It causes no overhead on !CONFIG_CONTAINERS. This
  code clearly seems mature now, hopefully the container bits go
  upstream in 2.6.24 too. Srivatsa did lots of heavy lifting in the past 
  few months, and this final bit of code that moves in all the 
  infrastructure changes almost nothing in the core scheduler.
- a triplet of nice simplifications from Dmitry Adamushko. Most notably
  Dmitry got rid of se->fair_key which shaves 8 bytes of task_struct and
  gives further speedup. Thanks Dmitry!
- continued refinements to the SMP ->vruntime code and timeslicing by 
  Peter Zijstra and Mike Galbraith.
As usual, bugreports, fixes and suggestions are welcome and please 
holler if some patch went missing in action.
