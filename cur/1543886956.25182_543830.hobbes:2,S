Really? I thought it was pretty cool to be able to shave several
hundreds of cycles off our page lock :)

Yep, no flags bloating at all.

Of course not, but they can just use a regular atomic word sized
bitop. The problem with i386 is that its atomic ops also imply
memory barriers that you obviously don't need on unlock. So I think
getting rid of them is pretty good. A grep of mm/ and fs/ for
lock_page tells me we want this to be as fast as possible even
if it isn't being used in the nopage fastpath.

Well I was resigned to that few % regression in the page fault path
until the G5 numbers showed that we needed to improve things. But
now it looks like (at least on my 2*HT P4 Xeon) that we don't have to
have any regression there.

Oh, well invalidate wants to be able to skip dirty pages or have the
filesystem do something special with them first. Once you have taken
the page out of the pagecache but still mapped shared, then blowing
it away doesn't actually solve the data loss problem... only makes
the window of VM inconsistency smaller.
