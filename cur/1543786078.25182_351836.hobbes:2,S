We gradually need to fix the deficiencies of the policy layer. Calling 
fixes "ugly code" and refusing to discuss solutions does not help anyone.

Have you ever had the challenge to work with large HPC applications on a 
large NUMA system? Which things? Many HPC apps do not use swap space 
at all and we likely wont be using swap for page migration (see Marcelo's 
work on a migration cache). All I have heard is you imagining complex 
solutions ("performance counters" etc) to things that would be simple if 
the policy layer would be up to the task.
