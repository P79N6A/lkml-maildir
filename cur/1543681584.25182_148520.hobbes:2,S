That's true.  But shouldn't it be true for both the TSO and non-TSO
case?

But sendfile() was _not_ used in any of the tests.  The ftp server
installed no the machine doesn't use it (not to my knowledge, at
least) and netperf only uses it for the SENDFILE test.

We could, but would it always be a win?  Especially for
copy_from_user().  Most of the time, that data remains cached, so I
don't think we'd want to use non-temporal stores on those (in
general).  csum_and_copy_from_user() isn't well optimized yet.  Let's
see if I can find a volunteer... ;-)
