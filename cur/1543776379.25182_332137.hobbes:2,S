Is there also a scrollback for after you log out of minicom and turn off
the machine ;-)
Thanks, I didn't know about that feature of minicom. I should really start
reading the fine manuals.  Unfortunately, the minicom was on my laptop
which I turned off yesterday and only today did I see your note.
To try and reproduce it again, I've added in /etc/rc3.d an S98reboot that
will switch the system to runlevel 6 again, and repeat the process over
and over. All this while connect to minicom and capturing.  Hopefully it
will eventually show the same bug.  If not, maybe it was just a fluke.
