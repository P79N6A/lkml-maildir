sorry, I should have written a few lines here...
issue solved (sorry for not CCing here, I'm shy ((: ) resulting in no 
need for a patch, just the need of a recent kernel and a userspace program.
I report here the full discussion I had with Linus Torvalds, Dmitry 
Torokhov (CCed to linux-input list):

Yes, please do verify.

You're welcome.

I'm certainly ok with it, but I guess it's more up to Dmitry. If he ack's
it, I can just commit it.
Dmitry? Any reason not to do this?

EVIOCSKEYCODE support for HID (USB) went in in 2.6.22-rc1.
There is keyfuzz utility you can use to play with keymaps for a
particular device:
