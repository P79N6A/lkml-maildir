Who is the target audience/user of those facilities?
a) The kernel itself needing to read/write SES pages?
b) A user space application using sysfs to read/write
   SES pages?
At the moment SES device management is done via
an application (user-space) and a user-space library
used by the application and /dev/sgX to send SCSI
commands to the SES device.
One could have a very good argument to not bloat
the kernel with this but leave it to a user-space
application and a library to do all this and
communicate with the SES device via the kernel's /dev/sgX.
