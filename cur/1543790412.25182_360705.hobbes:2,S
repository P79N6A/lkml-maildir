ecasound utilizes jack if it's on, which I don't really need so I
don't run it, but it is taking advantage of SCHED_FIFO. But truely
this is not what I'm trying to get to. I have something in this
computer that is interrupting everything +/- 6 seconds and I'd like to
find out what it is, I'm really just not sure the best way to find out
what the 'offender' is.
thanks,
