If you have a 9xxxx series ATA-33 drive it may have bad ASIC that violates
the ATA standard.
Also HPT366 support is native in the patch and it has been submitted to
Linus for the 2.3.12 inclusion.
A second patch has been sent to AC for initial review.
This is a shortened version of the code in 2.3.X that is only intel
centric, sorry.
