Some testing - now that's a great idea!  Good spotting.

Sorry, I should have noticed that: VM_ACCOUNT was certainly on my
mind as a flag that gives trouble when merging vmas, but I'd
misconvinced myself that it wasn't a problem in this case.

Please let me think on that - we can live with the status quo for
the moment.  I need to remind myself why I used that peculiar way
of conveying info from mmap.c to shmem.c: the right answer may be
just to pass another arg to shmem_zero_setup and shmem_file_setup.
