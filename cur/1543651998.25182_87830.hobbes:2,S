Yes, ACPI can and should use standard kernel interfaces when they are
available. The interfaces you're talking about don't exist yet, but could be
added.
An example of this is cpufreq. ACPI exposed its own proc interface before
cpufreq was integrated, but now it recently started working through cpufreq.
It should be relatively easy to establish generic interfaces for other areas
and hook ACPI into them.
