Subject: boottime "VFS: file-max limit 4096/8192 reached": module problem!

Hello,
I've just found why i always got a message (and i read more or less
similar reports)
VFS: file-max limit 4096 reached
or more recent 2.3. kernels:
VFS: file-max limit 8192 reached
only while booting, just after starting init, and for _some_ reason only
with the 2.3.xx kernels (/var/log/boot.msg):
<6>Partition check:
<6> hda: hda1 hda2 hda3
<6> hdc: hdc1 hdc2 hdc3
<4>VFS: Mounted root (ext2 filesystem) readonly.
<4>Freeing unused kernel memory: 136k freed
<4>VFS: file-max limit 8192 reached
<6>NET4: Unix domain sockets 1.0/SMP for Linux NET4.0.
<6>Adding Swap: 187984k swap-space (priority 100)
And there are some abnormal long delays when booting up in some of above
lines.
I just enabled "Unix domain sockets" "static" instead using it as modules,
and rebooted with new kernel, and never seen the message again :)
With pre-2.3.35-1 i rechecked this (with and without "Unix domain
sockets"-module) and found above results again.
And i just rebooted to 2.2.14pre4 and found indeed "Unix domain
sockets" compiled into the kernel.
So i think something in /sbin/init.d/boot before swapon -a may need badly
unix domain sockets, or perhaps init itself? Perhaps i should do a
"init=/usr/bin/strace /sbin/init"  ? :)
