Kind Kernel Peoples:
Upon upgrading from the stock 2.2.14 kernel to the up2date RedHat 6.2 
2.2.19-6.2.7 kernel, the following line in my driver makes the system
fully hang:
	x = inl(reg->bmsr);
The board is in a pci space.  I suspect the board simultaneously
died some time around the upgrade or the perhaps the pci hardware
implementation is not quite stable, or, maybe something changed in the
kernel.
Yes, reg->bmsr contains a valid address (0x0000ec7c) and this value did
not get "stomped on" since the PCI block was requested.  Further, I know
this is the culprit by using {return -1;} before and after this line and
observing hang/nohang behaviour.
TIA and patiently waiting,
