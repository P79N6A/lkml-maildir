Please do a few non-swap tests too. 
Swapping is the thing that rmap is supposed to _help_, so improvements in
that area are good (and had better happen!), but if you're only looking at
the swap performance, you're ignoring the known problems with rmap, ie the
cases where non-rmap kernels do really well.
Comparing one but not the other doesn't give a very balanced picture..
