What's the current wisdom with dual Athlon boards to get them stable?
This is my list so far (for Asus A7M266-D):
- Plug in a PS/2 mouse even though you don't use it. It fixes certain
  hardware problems.
- Select "PnP OS = no" in the BIOS so all PCI devices (even the ones
  behind the PCI-PCI bridge) get properly initialised.
- Boot Linux with "noapic" to avoid random hangs.
Exact BIOS revision doesn't seem to matter. Any more suggestions?
Erik
