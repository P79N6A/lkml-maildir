Register and unregister will continue to work as before, requiring a
process context and the ability to sleep.  notifier_block_enable/disable
should be used when:
	a callout wants to disable itself as it is running, or
	someone running in an atomic context wants to enable or disable
	a callout.
In the first case, unregister can't be used because it would hang.  In the 
second case, register/unregister can't be used because they need to be 
able to sleep.
In both cases the notifier block would have to be registered beforehand 
and unregistered later.

No; the list _won't_ be protected in call_chain.  It will be possible to
unregister a callout while the chain is in use.  That's how the RCU
approach works -- it uses no read locks, only write locks.
Deleting an entry while the list is in use is safe, because readers will
encounter either the old or the new value of the .next pointer, and either
one will be valid.  The important thing is to make sure that no one will
ever encounter the old pointer after unregister returns; that's what the
"while" loop is for.
