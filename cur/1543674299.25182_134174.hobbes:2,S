In edge-triggered mode, epoll will deliver an event only when events warrant it (sic).
If you decide to starve a client for a while, that client's fd
will only get an event or two as the last bits of I/O to it
occur; after that, no more events will come in unless you do
some I/O.
So I guess I'm saying "remember the fact that you got the event, but
don't do anything about it until you feel like it".
