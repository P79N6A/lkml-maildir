Subject: [PATCH 1/6] writeback: fix time ordering of the per superblock inode lists 8
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/8/19/12

Streamline the management of dirty inode lists and fix time ordering bugs.
The writeback logic used to moving not-yet-expired dirty inodes from s_dirty to
s_io, *only to* move them back. The move-inodes-back-and-forth thing is a mess,
which is eliminated by this patch.
The new scheme is:
- s_dirty acts as a time ordered io delaying queue;
- s_io/s_more_io together acts as an io dispatching queue.
On kupdate writeback, we pull some inodes from s_dirty to s_io at the start of
every full scan of s_io.  Otherwise(i.e. for sync/throttle/background
writeback), we always pull from s_dirty on each run(a partial scan).
Note that the line
	list_splice_init(&sb->s_more_io, &sb->s_io);
is moved to queue_io() to leave s_io empty. Otherwise a big dirtied file will
sit in s_io for a long time, preventing new expired inodes to get in.
