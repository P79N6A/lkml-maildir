Hi Guys - I was surprised to discover that the very latest 2.4.20
kernels running the latest -ck patches still have major VM problems,
even with the -aa VM.
Our dual Athlon server with 512Mb RAM / 1.2Gb swap, and not particularly
heavily loaded, lasted 81 days with 2.4.20-ck1 under RH8.0, and then
succumbed with these errors:
  VM error: killing process wineserver
   _alloc_pages: 0-order allocation failed (gfp=0x1d2/0)
This time, it only lasted _3 days_ with -ck4 before the same thing
happened.
I presume this is the OOM killer? Swap is indeed full, but I've no idea
why, on a machine that's only running a couple of instances of a small
Windoze app under WINE.
Is there a problem here? Should I just give up and run 2.5? ;-)
Cheers
Alastair                            .-=-.
