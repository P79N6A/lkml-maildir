I don't see such gross variations here, and there's nothing between -mm1 and
-mm2 which could cause this.  (BTW: what idiot broke diffstat as distributed
in rh8.0?  It fails to understand interdiff output, which is quite
legitimately formatted).
However there are some interesting snippets.  Elapsed time for io_load:
2.5.59: 					182,183,180
2.5.59 + deadline-np-42:			198,114,106,112,183,140
2.5.59 + deadline-np-42 + deadline-np-43:	224,224
2.5.59-mm2:					212,239
So it looks like deadline-np-42.patch lessens starvation of reads by writes,
and deadline-np-43.patch considerably worsens it.
But this is all just fiddling around.  Nick is working on an implementation
of anticipatory scheduling, which is a whole new ball game.  The pressure is
on ;)
