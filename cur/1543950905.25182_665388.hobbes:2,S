Hum, may be to avoid confusion with a new protocol handler, I can add my 
hook in usb_stor_control_thread with a new flag.
Something like :
[...]
  /* Handle those devices which need us to fake
          * their inquiry data */
         else if ((us->srb->cmnd[0] == INQUIRY) &&
                 (us->flags & US_FL_FIX_INQUIRY)) {
[...]
	else if (( (us->srb->cmnd[0] == ATA_12) || (us->srb->cmnd[0] == ATA_16)) &&
                 (us->flags & US_FL_CYPRESS_ATACB)) {
         US_DEBUGP("emulating ATA pass thru\n");
		call to emulate_pass_thru_with_atacb code
         }
         /* we've got a command, let's do it! */
         else {
             US_DEBUG(usb_stor_show_command(us->srb));
             us->proto_handler(us->srb, us);
         }
Does it sound better ?
