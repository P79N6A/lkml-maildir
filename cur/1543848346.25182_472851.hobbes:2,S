well.... breaking stuff for no reason other than "but it sounds like HIS
name" is I thing bad. Yes the name is unfortunate, but if you can use
the interface... why not? Just because the name isn't perfect everyone
should change over, including keeping compatibility mess etc etc?
That needs a stronger reason than "it sounds like his name" to me...
Now if the interface itself isn't good enough, that's a different matter
of course; but from what I read so far that's not really the case.
