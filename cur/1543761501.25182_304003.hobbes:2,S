If we need to do priority inheritance across the memory allocator, so
that high-priority tasks blocked waiting for memory pass their priority
on to RCU readers, agreed.  But I don't see any sign that real-time
preempt does this.
In absence of this, as Ingo noted, the fact that readers don't block
each other should make things be safe.  I think...
