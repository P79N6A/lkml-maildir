I think you missed the why behind the comment just above your first change.

The exit code notices that there is no signal handler for SIGCHILD and
does a fast exit, then we notice when woken up the child no longer exists.
Rusty discovered this back in June when we were trying to fix a checker
error on the wait call, and decided that at the time no one was using the
return value, hence the simpler fix.
