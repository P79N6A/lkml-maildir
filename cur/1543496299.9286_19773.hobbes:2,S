Hey, I got an idea, but I don't know if it has already been or is being
implemented, but I think it can boost SMP performance. Why not have
multiple swap files, one for each processor? Processes scheduled to run
on a given CPU would have a higher probability of being swapped to a
given swap file... Then you could put two swap files onto two separate
drives for two processors. I think that could boost performance.... Or
would there be too much overhead?
