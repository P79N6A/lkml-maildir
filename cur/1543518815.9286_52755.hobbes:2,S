The console system really needs a major overhaul. Keynoard hanlding is
just one thing. Their also is multihead support thet needs to be
added. Then their is also expanding the character size from 8 bit to
16. This way you can display up to 65K types of characters. With this
asian characters can be displayed. Their are also other little things
needed to be done.
