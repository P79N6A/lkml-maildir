Yes I have some draft of patches that enable mmap. But I think we should 
fist make the non mmap case work cleanly.
The current approach is to map higher order pages into an address space on 
a per PTE basis. A page fault will establish one pte which may point to a 
tail page of a compound page. This means that the 4k semantics are 
preserved. We essentially manage pointers into 4k sections of larger 
pages.
Later we could add support for PMD faults. If the page size is larger than
pmd size then establish pmds mapping 2M instead of ptes. But that would be 
much much later when everything else works.
