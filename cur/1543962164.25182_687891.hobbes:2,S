And another problem is that often, it's hard to get good "real work" coverage
over the whole tree.  I just discovered an apparent borkage somewhere in
the networking/wireless area that seems to have gotten into Linus's tree
somewhere between 24-rc8 and 24-final, just because I haven't beaten on
my wireless card in the last few weeks, so I didn't notice a regression in
'ip link show' related to the rfkill switch...
