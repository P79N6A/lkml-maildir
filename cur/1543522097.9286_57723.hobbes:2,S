>There seems to be some race when using parallel build. 
some parts of the build prosess is indeed not parallelizable.  The
heaviest steps are, fortunately.
I used to do 
make dep clean bzlilo modules modules_install
and tried just puting a -j 3 in front of that on the dual machine.
It turns out that "dep" will conflict with itself, so it must run
singular.
No surprise when "modules" and "modules_install" failed when running
simultaneously either.  Try this:
make dep clean & make -j 3 bzlilo modules & make modules_install
All the compiling happens in parallel, and that's the heaviest part.
