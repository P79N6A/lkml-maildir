It's actually a problem that gcc assumes 686 = 686+cmov. The glibc
isn't broken, its just compiled for gcc's view of what 686 is.

No. K6-III is a family 5 processor, so should get built for 586.

Its not a glibc bug.

This is the best of the bunch, and is the same solution debian users
were using for some time a while back when someone made a '686' version
of libssl.
