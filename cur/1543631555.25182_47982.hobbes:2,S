Hi Ron.

I seem to remember somewhere that CC should always be defined to be just
the name of the executable, and any flags should be defined in CFLAGS
rather than in CC itself. Memory says that in some circumstances, make
can do the wrong thing if this rule isn't followed.
Perhaps somebody can confirm this?
Best wishes from Riley.
