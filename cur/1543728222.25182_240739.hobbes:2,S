Eh? what's the peak run? the one out of 10 with best performace. Oddly,
what you're seeing doesn't match what I'm seeing at all ... I'm looking
at average runtime. SDET is fairly variable - I don't think looking at
the best run is a good idea.

Me too.

Very odd. would suggest you do a few more runs - for 4 scripts,
you're matching the results of nostaircase, for 16, without it.
