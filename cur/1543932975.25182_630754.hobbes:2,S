I don't think that many OEMs have that much control over the BIOS in
their "value lines".
:)
And the MMCONFIG problem with enterprise systems and workstations, where
we do control the BIOS (for the most part), is due to known bugs in
certain versions of certain chipsets, HT1000, AMD8132, among them, not
the BIOS.
Anyway, we are devising better ways to deal with these anomalies
than blacklists and telling customers to use "pci=nommconf"
And we're bringing them to the community for discussion, improvement,
and, we hope, acceptance.
