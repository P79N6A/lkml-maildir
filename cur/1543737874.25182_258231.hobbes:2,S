My "console=uart" patch
 
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0409.1/1034.html
is a start, I think.  Relative to the current situation, it
 - requires different syntax ("console=uart" vs "console=ttyS0"),
   though a platform could choose to translate "console=ttyS0"
   into "console=uart,io,0x3f8"
 - can start working much earlier (no interrupts or clock
   calibration required)
 - doesn't deal with all the wierd devices the full driver does
 - transitions automatically to the matching ttyS device after
   the driver is initialized
