We've set the accessed bit for a long time.  From asm-i388/pgtable.h:
#define PAGE_SHARED     __pgprot(_PAGE_PRESENT | _PAGE_RW | _PAGE_USER | _PAGE_ACCESSED)
#define PAGE_COPY       __pgprot(_PAGE_PRESENT | _PAGE_USER | _PAGE_ACCESSED)
#define PAGE_READONLY   __pgprot(_PAGE_PRESENT | _PAGE_USER | _PAGE_ACCESSED)
Now will you stop trying to incite pointless riots and allow those of us
who are trying to use linux-kernel as a useful means of communicating
development issues a chance for a decent signal to noise ratio?
