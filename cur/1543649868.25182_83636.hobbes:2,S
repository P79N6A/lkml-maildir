On Via Ezra 667 I get this:
Csum benchmark program
buffer size: 4 Mb
Each test tried 16 times, max and min CPU cycles are reported.
Please disregard max values. They are due to system interference only.
csum tests:
                     kernel_csum - took  2739 max, 2727 min cycles per kb. sum=0x44000077
                     kernel_csum - took  2733 max, 2727 min cycles per kb. sum=0x44000077
                     kernel_csum - took  2733 max, 2727 min cycles per kb. sum=0x44000077
                  kernelpii_csum - took  2691 max, 2686 min cycles per kb. sum=0x44000077
copy tests:
                     kernel_copy - took  2044 max, 2014 min cycles per kb. sum=0x44000077
                     kernel_copy - took  2026 max, 2016 min cycles per kb. sum=0x44000077
                     kernel_copy - took  2061 max, 2016 min cycles per kb. sum=0x44000077
                  kernelpii_copy - took  1526 max, 1523 min cycles per kb. sum=0x44000077
Done
The nt* functions do not work on this CPU.
