actually, my BIOS is even to old for e.g. ACPI, with latest firmware
installed. i had no issues so far with the board/bios, but perhaps this is
no longer true. however, it's still strange that this thing is only
triggerd with you change and CONFIG_EDD=y.

nevermind then. as nobody else seem to be bothered by this i am happy with
the workarund (CONFIG_EDD=n) and since the lkml-archives exist we could
get back to it when it's bothering more people (n>1)
thank you for your time,
Christian.
