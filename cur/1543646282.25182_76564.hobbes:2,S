part 3:
[depends on -02-SMP]
If an object is freed from a slab, then move the slab to the tail of the 
partial list - this should increase the probability that the other 
objects from the same page are freed, too, and that a page can be 
returned to gfp later.
The cpu arrays are now always in front of the list, i.e. cache hit rates 
should not matter.
Please apply
