Well, if the semaphore is grabbed then the critical section is serialized
including accessing of IPC ids, so there would be no need to have
a separate spinlock for the IPC ids. Hugh pointed out the right reason,
semaphore IPCs use the spinlock for serialization in many paths,
not the semaphore in ipc_ids. 
Hugh's point is right - you have two data structures to protect - ipc_id
arrays and the kern_ipc_perms attached to it. I would use a single
spinlock in ipc_ids to serialize all the updates and use RCU for both
to implement safe lockfree lookups. For the second, you would probably
want to add a rcu_head to struct kern_ipc_perms and an RCU callback
to free it.
Thanks
