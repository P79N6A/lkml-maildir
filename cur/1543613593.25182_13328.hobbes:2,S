Yes, every single mount is an independant tree.

What I like most about /tmp in tmpfs is the ability to resize on the
fly: I have a big swap partition and a reasonable limit for /tmp and
/var/tmp.
When one of these gets full I can either stop the affending job or
increase the limit: If there is swap left I can simply increase the
limit. If swap is full I add a swap file on a real filesystem and
increase the limit.

P.S: Documentation/filesystems/tmpfs.txt is in the 2.4.17-rc patch.
