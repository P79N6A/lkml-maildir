Subject: [PATCH] move sg_dma_ macros out of asm-i386/pci.h
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

These macros belong in asm-i386/scatterlist.h instead.
As the headers are disentangled this has shown up as a problem with my
MCA SCSI drivers since they no-longer include asm/pci.h in any form but
need to traverse the scatterlist.
