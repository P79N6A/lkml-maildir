Undoing some of the trimming to include the vserver guys at least.
Herbert at least has a better handle on how to do resource limits
than I do.

There is a reason I'm cleaning up /proc at the moment :)
But the only real gotcha I see is how do we do per namespace resource
limits.  As opposed to global resource limits.  For the moment
just having truly global limits seems reasonable.

I successfully handled pid_max.  So while it is awkward you can get
per task values in and out if sysctl.

So having both is doable.  Although most of that goes to resource
limits, and resource limits are something we clearly need to discuss
but they really are a separate problem.

There is nothing in the implementation of sysvipc that is inherently
hierarchical.  So it would simply be disjoin flat namespaces.  That
are only hierarchical in the sense that they are connected to
processes which form a hierarchical process tree.
As for the resource limit problem that is the domain of CKRM and the
bean counter patches.  The isolation work we are doing may put a new
spin on the problem and help it get solved but it isn't something we
need to solve.
Herbert Poetzl has suggest in the past is that we may need some kind
of namespace off to the side that is the essence of a container and
has all of the container resource limits.

There aren't that many of them, and what different groups want to
share/unshare is different.  The biggest difference is that for
migration restart it is not necessary to solve the problem of having
the same UID map to multiple user_structs depending on the context and
all of the weird things that will do to permission checking in the
kernel.
There are also a few items migration cares about that people doing
virtual private servers don't.  Like the ability to isolate monotonic
timers, so even after migration the monotonic properties are
maintained.  If you always remain on the same kernel that is a problem
that simply does not come up.
