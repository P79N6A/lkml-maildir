It gets used, the fact that you don't hit it for your workload(s) is
pretty uninteresting. Try threaded io tests, for instance.
That said, the one-hit cache is pretty effective since a process usually
gets to submit more than one request at the time (which is why it's
there). In 2.6 merges aren't as important anymore due to large io
submissions. You didn't say what version of the kernel you are looking
at though, so kind of hard to really say anything about your
'investigation'.

In 2.4 it's a O(N) scan, which doubles as an insertion scan (meaning we
have to do it anyways). In 2.6 it's a hash lookup, quick enough.
You also didn't say how you are logging this info. If you are using
printk() to log every request you pretty much already Heisenberged your
test. Even without qualifying the supposedly wasted CPU time.
