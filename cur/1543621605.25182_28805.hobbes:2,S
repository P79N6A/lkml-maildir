Hi Richard!

Sorry for sending the patch as attachment, but Notes messes
up whitespace so the patch would'nt apply if I include it directly.

I do not think this patch is very nice either & it does not work at
all (the initialisation of the array is only called in error case).
I find the overall thing for registering/deregistering devices &
allocating majors very inconsistent.
devfs_alloc_major and devfs_register_*dev do hold the information
about which majors are allocated in two different places without
knowing about each other (bdops field and this private bitfield).
A good solution would be if *dev_register would never return a
major being statically allocated when called with major 0. If this is the
case, I do not see what alloc_major and dealloc_major are useful for.
mit freundlichem Gruß / with kind regards
