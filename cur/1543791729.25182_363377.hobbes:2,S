I found hugetlb support in linux not very practical/usable on NUMA machines, 
boot-time parameters or /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages.
With this single integer parameter, you cannot allocate 1000 4MB pages on one 
specific node, letting small pages on another node.
I'm not an astrophysician, nor a DB admin, I'm only trying to partition a dual 
node machine between one (numa aware) memory intensive job and all others 
(system, network, shells).
At least I can reboot it if needed, but I feel Andy pain.
There is a /proc/buddyinfo file, maybe we need a /proc/sys/vm/node_hugepages 
with a list of integers (one per node) ?
