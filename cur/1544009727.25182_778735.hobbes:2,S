Curious...my kernel is CONFIG_X86_32=y and CONFIG_X86=y, CONFIG_MK6=y.
Perhaps this could be an issue with the Windows Server side (Windows Home
Server, latest Windows SPs, etc.)  Maybe MSFT introduced some "improvement"
in a recent update that caused an incompatibility of some sort.  I can try
mounting some other Windows machines via CIFS from the 2.6.27.8 end and see
what happens, plus boot back to 2.6.27.6 and compare.
