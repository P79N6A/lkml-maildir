Only if we really consider the printks in question "whatever the default
is."  The default has changed before and may change again (as you are
suggesting).  I have no problem changing the default - I just think if
Denis suggests a printk should be classified as "informative" and we
agree, let's change it.  Although I don't think it would fly with Linus,
any printk we can solidly classify we should, imo.
This doesn't preclude changing the default, as you suggest, especially
if its clearly too high.  But I don't see why we shouldn't be explicit
where possible.  No?
