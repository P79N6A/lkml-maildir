Same thing happens to me when I compile programs over nfs and the server's
date is a little ahead of the client.  Doesn't happen when client is ahead
of the server.
Because of the date, it seems that the kernel won't build over nfs if the
times are wrong.  (problem with a header included in version.c IIRC.  It
get's I/O error on the header)
