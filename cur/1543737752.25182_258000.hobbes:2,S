Bugs and high latency code paths that should instead be fixed.

By _definition_, when you turn on preempt, you hide the stuff I just
described above.
Hiding that stuff means that users and developers won't see code paths
that need fixing.  If users and developers aren't aware of code paths
that need fixing, they don't get fixed.
Therefore, by advocating preempt, you are advocating a solution _other
than_ actually making the necessary fixes.
