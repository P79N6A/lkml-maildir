Folks, this is getting a little silly.
Even if CONFIG_NO_HZ is new this is a an important regression, and
yes we should avoid regressions wherever we can, and for such a quite
important feature we should fix it.  On the other hand blktrace is using
the wrong interface, and it has been told multiple times on lkml that
sched_clock() should never ever be used outside the scheduler.  So the
burden to fix this regression lies on the shoulders of the blktrace
maintainer.
No need for silly name calling here.
