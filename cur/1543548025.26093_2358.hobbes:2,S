I just found out that gcc-2.96 won't compile glibc-2.1.93 or glibc-2.1.2 or
glibc-2.1.3 successfully whereas gcc-2.95.2 will.  It bombs in a couple of
places.
I just downgraded my machine to 2.95.2 to prove the point.  Guess I'll wait
for gcc-3.0.

Oh.  I've been using gcc-2.96 with test7 for a while, no problems except
the ## warnings.  Never occured to me that gcc-2.95.2 would be better,
which I was using for ages before that...
