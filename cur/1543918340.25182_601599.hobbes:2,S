No - the new pdflush is put in the same cpuset as its parent, with a
patch that I sent in early this year.  See the following code in
mm/pdflush.c:
        /*
         * Some configs put our parent kthread in a limited cpuset,
         * which kthread() overrides, forcing cpus_allowed == CPU_MASK_ALL.
         * Our needs are more modest - cut back to our cpusets cpus_allowed.
         * This is needed as pdflush's are dynamically created and destroyed.
         * The boottime pdflush's are easily placed w/o these 2 lines.
         */
        cpus_allowed = cpuset_cpus_allowed(current);
        set_cpus_allowed(current, cpus_allowed);
        return __pdflush(&my_work);
