NO! Dammit, you'll break everyone who is using these compact names to
mount the root FS. Look more closely at the code you're trying to
remove, and you'll see it's *not* used to avoid work in startup
scripts. It's only used to create the devfs entry for the root FS.
This change is gratuitous. The code is __init code anyway, so doesn't
contribute to bloat. And forcing people to migrate to the longer names
isn't reasonable, as it chews up precious space on the kernel command
line. I've had times where I ran out of space when I had too many
options.
Linus, please don't apply.
