Yeah I tend to agree and most of my work to date has been squashing
false positives.

For now I've disabled this one.  Put it in the freezer with the
StudlyCaps one.
I like the idea of checking for #if 0 as that is very likely bogus in a
patch meant for inclusion.

All very good points.  It does only reply to emails which are clearly
unidiff patches and silently drops all else.  But the potential for spam
is worrysome ... will think on this some and see if we can come up with
a safety net.

I am getting a fair bit of feedback, most of it copied to Joel and Randy
so at least that bit is working.
