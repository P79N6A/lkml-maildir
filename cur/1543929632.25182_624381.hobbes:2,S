Incremental patch:
From: Andrew Morton <akpm@linux-foundation.org>
Fix checkpatch warnings:
ERROR: do not use C99 // comments
#72: FILE: scripts/kallsyms.c:516:
+	// sort by address first
ERROR: do not use C99 // comments
#78: FILE: scripts/kallsyms.c:522:
+	// sort by "weakness" type
ERROR: do not use C99 // comments
#84: FILE: scripts/kallsyms.c:528:
+	// sort by initial order, so that other symbols are left undisturbed
total: 3 errors, 0 warnings, 61 lines checked
Your patch has style problems, please review.  If any of these errors
are false positives report them to the maintainer, see
CHECKPATCH in MAINTAINERS.
Please run checkpatch prior to sending patches
And a few coding-style things which checkpatch missed.
And fix up constificiation to remove typecasting.
