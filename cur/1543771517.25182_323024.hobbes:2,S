Probably not.  x86_64 can emulate / run 32bit environment, and run 32bit
programs assuming you have all the required 32bit libraries.  That
doesn't mean rpm has to know about that.  I don't know how redhat
handles x86_64, but certainly Debian does not accept a 32bit package to
be installed by the 64bit package manager.  You can however setup a
chroot and run a 32bit environment in the chroot seperate from the 64bit
to manage software installs, and then run the program from outside the
chroot afterwards.  At least on Debian.

Highly unlikely.

Using a 32bit rpm installer I imagine.

A redhat list would be more likely to know.  It's not a kernel problem,
but an rpm user space problem.
