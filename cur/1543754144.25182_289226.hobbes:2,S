It's already there.  Look at the code in vfs_link.  The security_inode_link
hook is documented in include/linux/security.h.  And the restrictive policy
you're referring to is already codified in the owlsm module.  See the
do_owlsm_link() function here (code's a bit old, but basic idea is still
relevant):
