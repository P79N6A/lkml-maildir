Greetings;
Running 2.6.15-rc7, uptime 6d 23:43 atm.
Going thru the systems email output, I note this in the logwatch file, 
something I don't recall seeing previously:
 --------------------- Kernel Begin ------------------------ 
WARNING:  Kernel Errors Present
   smb_lookup: find contrib/ircstats2 failed, error=-5...:  1 Time(s)
   smb_proc_readdir_long: error=-2, breaking...:  2 Time(s)
   smb_proc_readdir_long: error=-5, breaking...:  1 Time(s)
   smb_proc_readdir_long: error=-512, breaking...:  1 Time(s)
 ---------------------- Kernel End -------------------------
Does anyone have a clue?  Other than its samba related, I have no clue.

Cheers, Gene
People having trouble with vz bouncing email to me should add the word
'online' between the 'verizon', and the dot which bypasses vz's
stupid bounce rules.  I do use spamassassin too. :-)
