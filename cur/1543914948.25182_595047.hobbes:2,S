Subject: [PATCH 039/104] KVM: kvm_vm_ioctl_get_dirty_log restore "nothing dirty" optimization
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Rusty Russell <rusty@rustcorp.com.au>
kvm_vm_ioctl_get_dirty_log scans bitmap to see it it's all zero, but
doesn't use that information.
Avi says:
	Looks like it was used to guard	kvm_mmu_slot_remove_write_access();
	optimizing the case where the guest just leaves the screen alone (which
	it usually does, especially in benchmarks).
	I'd rather reinstate that optimization.  See
	90cb0529dd230548a7f0d6b315997be854caea1b where the damage was done.
It's pretty simple: if the bitmap is all zero, we don't need to do anything to
clean it.
