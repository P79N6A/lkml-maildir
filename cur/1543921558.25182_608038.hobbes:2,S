Hi Vaidy,
I will use the metric you have suggested.
Thanks,
Ravi

Thats correct. The used excluding the buffer caches gives most of the
memory used by the system.  You have excludes _all_ file backed memory
including shm.

Two problems with this logic:
1. all of tmpfs may not be really used.  You are over committing.
2. You still miss the pages needed to map the program code.  They are
file backed too. Though this will be very less amount of memory compared
to data  and shared memory.
Let me suggest a metric:
1. Take the used part excluding the buffers (309MB) in your case and add
'Mapped' and 'Dirty' from /proc/meminfo
This may be better than adding tmpfs/shmdev size.
2. Once your system is running will all applications loaded, cleanup the
pagecache (file data cached in memory)
sync
echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
The first sync will bring down 'Dirty' count and drop_caches will
reclaim all 'not needed' file cache memory.
Now if you use 'free' and take the used count _with_ the buffers and
file cache, this will provide a realistic value. (Actually Free in
/proc/meminfo)
Do not exclude buffers they are _needed_ for optimum system operation.
With the above figure you can probably add 10% or more memory as extra
memory for file cache when the system is operating with full load.
If you want to be sure of these experiments boot you system with less
memory using mem=xxx kernel parameter and run some performance tests to
ensure the degradation is under acceptable limits.
