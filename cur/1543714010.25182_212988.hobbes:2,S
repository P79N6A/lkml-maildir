I've seen this kind of lockup (according to sysrq-T) on different boxes:
1) ope
	RAID:		mylex 352
	drivers:	e100, dac960
	.config:	
http://sysadminday.org.ru/2.6.1-io_lockup/ope/.config
2) terror
	RAID:		megaraid 320-2
	drivers:	e1000, megaraid2
	.config:	
http://sysadminday.org.ru/2.6.X-lockup/terror/.config
3) mirror
	drivers:	e100, aic7xxx, md, netconsole
	.config:	
http://sysadminday.org.ru/2.6.X-lockup/mirror/.config
I also saw the same symptoms on a fourth box, but I'm not shure about
this one because it didn't use to be attached to serial console at that time.
For this box:
	RAID:		Compaq smart 2
	drivers:	tlan,epic100,cpqarray
