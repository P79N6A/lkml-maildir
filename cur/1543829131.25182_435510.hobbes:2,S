FWIW, my main -mm testing system (with a reiserfs root filesystem)
blows up during boot with 2.6.17-mm1 + the hotfix. I haven't tried
plain 2.6.17-mm1 or 2.6.17-mm1 with the reiserfs patches reverted. The
last kernel this system ran was 2.6.17-rc6-mm2, with lockdep disabled,
with no problems whatsoever.
Unfortunately I still haven't gotten around to adding a serial console
to this box *and* I do not have access to my digital camera for
approx. 2 weeks. I guess I'll try to add a serial console ASAP. This
will probably take me a day or two however.
