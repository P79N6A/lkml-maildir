I don't disagree with the thumbnail/icon/description, but things like
POSIX acls and extended attributes have _existing_ interfaces which
should be used.  I don't deny them the right to add other interfaces
later, but such should be a secondary or tertiary patch, after the
rest of the stuff is in.  In any case, if we were to provide an
interface by which one could $EDITOR the POSIX ACLs, it should be
done in the VFS where all filesystems can share it.

The key difference here is that Mac OS X does all of the bundle mess
in userspace where it belongs. :-D  (I know, I use it daily)  I think
that part of Reiser4 needs more review than it's been given at present.
