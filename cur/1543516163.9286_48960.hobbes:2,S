I made just that suggestion to the guy who originally posted the
article. I also said that he should inform Sun with the reasons he isn't
running StarOffice.
	It's the ISV's who have to become compatible with Linux, not the other
way round, else we end up with a mish-mash of a kernel and a
falling-down OS a-la MScrap whence the said ISV's will eventually ruin,
then dump Linux unceremoneously. It's in our enlightened self-interest
to maintain the disciplined approach here rather than bend to
accommodate the worst practices, Linux will gain reputation and respect
from holding fast to standards.
