Hi all...
I am running glibc-2.3.1 on top of a hacked 2.4.21-pre2+aa, and all programs
show a curious message at exit when straced:
strace ls:
...
SYS_252(0, 0x1000, 0x156ad360, 0x156ae824, 0) = -1 ENOSYS (Function not implemented)
_exit(0)                                = ?
252 is __NR_exit_group. I can not recover anything about this on MARC, is there
any pointer to that for 2.4 ? Is it in -ac kernels ?
BTW: I remember to see some posts about this, but _how_ can I make the search
engine in MARC to do _not_ convert underscores to spaces ("exit_group" ->
"exit group", and results not be half the posts in LKML) ???
TIA
