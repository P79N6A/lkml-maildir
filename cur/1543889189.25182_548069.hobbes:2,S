I don't see any use for that.  But indeed, it should not be too hard
to do.

So your question is, which mount takes priority on the lookup?  It
probably should be the propagated real mount, rather than the
dir-on-file one, shouldn't it?

Final mntput of what?

I think it's done right: detach_mnt() with namespace_sem and
vfsmount_lock, then release locks, and path_release(&old_nd).
If the recursion is extremely deep we could have stack overflow
problems though, aargh...
