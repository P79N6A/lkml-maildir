If I might offer a suggestion, that requires a patched mount command, etc.
I would offer as an alternative implementation which might be both easier
to do and more useful in testing. Make the capability an option in the
kernel, and then require that it be enabled in /proc/sys with default off.
Think TCP_SYN_COOKIES or similar. That way you can have a single patch set
for the kernel only, and no one can possibly "stumble on it" and complain.
Also, you can disable without reboot or remount after testing.
