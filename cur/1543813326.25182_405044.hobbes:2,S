 but I don't know if that's its origin.

The patch looks remarkably like the one I originally submitted for
comments.
I'm still running Linux on my Dell Inspiron 8200 and I'm not using
that patch anymore. Rather, I found a package that recently made it to
the Debian unstable repository, hotkey-setup
http://packages.debian.org/unstable/misc/hotkey-setup
which you may want to consider for inclusion on Fedora too. On the
Debian BTS you will also see a Bug/Wish from me
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=355223
with additional definitions for the multimedia keys on my Dell and
some comments.
