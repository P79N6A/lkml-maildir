Subject: [Patch 0/4] four small cpuset patches ...

Here are four small patches that I would like included in the
cpuset patches in *-mm.  Simon Derr has reviewed them and found
them reasonable.  I have built, booted and unit tested them.
They are:
 1) Add cpus_allowed, mems_allowed to /proc/<pid>/status
 2) Simplify recalculation of new cpus_allowed when task changes cpuset
 3) Remove a bit of slightly broken, completely useless, code
 4) Tweak top cpuset to have just online, not all possible, cpus and nodes.
