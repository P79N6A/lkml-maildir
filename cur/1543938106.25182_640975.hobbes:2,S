I was confused by this too. Search the ppc list archives and there is
a thread about it where BenH tries to explain the correct way of
fixing it to me.
This is part of the ppc to powerpc conversion that has not been
completely cleaned up in this driver. NO_IRQ = -1 is ppc and NO_IRQ =
0 is powerpc. Since this driver didn't originally use the NO_IRQ
define it didn't get automatically converted. We need to identify the
right places where NO_IRQ should have been used.

I missed this one, it should have been NO_IRQ.

It is only bailing out on an error, not the NO_IRQ case. But maybe the
comparison needs to be with NO_IRQ instead of zero.

All of this is very confusing to me, There are physical IRQs and
virtual IRQs. Apparently zero is a legal physical IRQ but it is not a
legal virtual IRQ. We only get virtual IRQs in this code. We need to
get BenH to give us the right answer on these two cases.
