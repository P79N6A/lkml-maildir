On the base point, libata has never enabled SMART on its own.  That's 
always up to the BIOS, etc.
It's possible that the recent addition of ACPI support will cause disks 
to be in different modes than previously expected.  ACPI supplies ATA 
taskfiles to be pushed to the disk, and who knows what's in there...
