Modularization usually is done through a level of indirection (function
pointers).  I have a can of "indirection be gone" almost ready to spray over
the plugsched framework that would reduce the overhead to zero at runtime.
I'd be happy to finish that work if it makes it more palpable to integrate a
plugsched framework into the kernel?
