timekeeping_init() is pretty straight forward:
	write_seqlock_irqsave(&xtime_lock, flags);
	clock = clocksource_get_next();
	clocksource_calculate_interval(clock, tick_nsec);
	clock->cycle_last = clocksource_read(clock);
	ntp_clear();
	write_sequnlock_irqrestore(&xtime_lock, flags);
We initialize the clock value and call ntp_clear.  The jiffies
clocksource will be used to start - other clocksources will be selected
as they become available.
Just to be sure, which inter-dependencies where you're thinking of?
