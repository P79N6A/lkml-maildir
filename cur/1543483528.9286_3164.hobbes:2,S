probably the wrong way to go -- padding NULLs might kill your original data (semantics)!
which tape drive are you using ?
check the default tape block size for both 2.0/2.2 kernel using `mt stat'.
for DAT, EXABYTE etc. (which do support variable length tape blocks)
you can/should use
	mt setblk 0
to enable variable block lengths.  so you can write final blocks which
are not multiples of blocksize (and not mutliples of powers of two).
