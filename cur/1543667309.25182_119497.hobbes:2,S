First thing we need to work out is whether it is a CPU scheduler thing
or if it is a VM/MM/block/fs latency problem.
- How much memory do you have?
- Are your disks runnning in DMA mode? (run hdparm /dev/hda)
- Send `vmstat 1' traces from when the problem is happening.
- If you nice up the X server, does that help?
- Try setting /proc/sys/vm/swappiness to zero
- Try decreasing /proc/sys/vm/dirty_ratio to 15
