There is no interface in virtio currently to batch multiple queue 
notifications so the only way one could do this AFAICT is to use a timer 
to delay the notifications.  Were you thinking of something else?

That can be a different device.

I don't think so.  A vmexit is required to lower the IRQ line.  It may 
be possible to do something clever like set a shared memory value that's 
checked on every vmexit.  I think it's very unlikely that it's worth it 
though.

My first implementation did that.  I switched to using a selector 
because it reduces the amount of PCI config space used and does not 
limit the number of queues defined by the ABI as much.

Yes, it's also not stricly needed on cleanup I think.  I left it there 
though for clarity.  I can remove.
