Subject: NFS locking and such, Getting stuck in D state.

basic info:
-both smp machines running 2.2.0-pre6 
-nfs sharing mail spool over automount with rpc.statd and lockd locking
-userspace nfs
-client runs redhat, server slackware
one of my users gets pine stuck in the D state, I am not quite sure how
but it involves checking mail on main mail server and his machine with the
mail spool automounted via nfs (/home/mail) pine get stuck on the client.
ps auxl reports that pine is in rpc_execute
the syslog has strange rpc errors involving requests/dentries and return
errors.
I have two questions:
1: is anyone intrested in this error.  I am willing to generate more
infomation and look into the exact way of reproducing the this state.
2: is there a way that i can get the kernel to tell me what it was trying
to do, ie dump the stack, or force an oops or such. Or have pine dump
core. I can't attach via gdb (the D state) so I am trying to figure out
how to see what pine was upto when this happened.
