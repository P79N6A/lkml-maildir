	Loading the module won't happen without a config, but there's no
requirement that a built-in netconsole has a kernel command-line
argument.  I always build netconsole for my kernels.  Sure, I usually do
it as a module, but if I build a monolithic kernel I compile it in.
That doesn't mean I always have a server, let alone a netconsole= option
:-)
