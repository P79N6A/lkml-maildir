OK, I misunderstood your original report to mean that something was 
complaining about "too much" output.  You're saying that lots of console 
output seems to lock the domain.
I've had a report about heavy disk IO seems to lock up as well.  Perhaps 
they're both related to high event rates.  Do you think you could try an 
IO-intensive workload to see if you can get a similar lockup?
When the domain is locked up, what does /usr/lib/xen/bin/xenctx say?
Hm.  Rather than backing out the structure-change patch, could you try 
this workaround:
diff -r be3ca4e0e19e arch/x86/xen/enlighten.c

+static int have_vcpu_info_placement = 0;
 
 static void __init xen_vcpu_setup(int cpu)
 {
Reverting the structure shape could cause crashes or random data 
corruption, but it has the side-effect of disabling the vpu_info 
structure placement mechanism.  This patch disables it cleanly.
Thanks,
