Subject: [PATCH] Fix a use after free bug in kernel->userspace relay file support
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Coverity spotted what looks like a real possible case of using a 
variable after it has been freed.
The problem is in kernel/relay.c::relay_open_buf()
If the code hits "goto free_buf;" it ends up in this code :
  free_buf:
    	relay_destroy_buf(buf);	<--- calls kfree() on 'buf'.
  free_name:
   	kfree(tmpname);
  end:
  	return buf;		<-- use after free of 'buf'.
I read through the callers and they all handle a NULL return 
from this function as an error (and hitting the 'free_buf' label 
only happens on failure to chan->cb->create_buf_file(), so that 
looks like a clear error to me). 
The patch simply sets 'buf' to NULL after the call to 
relay_destroy_buf(buf); - as far as I can see that should take 
care of the problem.
The patch also corrects a reference to a documentation file while 
I was at it.
Note from Mathieu: the documentation reference change should have been
done in a separate patch, but I guess no one will really care.
