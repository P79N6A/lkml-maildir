sometimes tracking down exactly what options need to be enabled to let you 
at other options that apply to your system can be quite a chore, a tool to 
start from no .config file and get you one that is tailered to your system 
could be useful.
I agree that make oldconfig shouldn't do this type of thing, but that 
requires that youhave an existing .config for the box. if you do a make 
autoconfig you are explicitly asking the software to do this for you.
