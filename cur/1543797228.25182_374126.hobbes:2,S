I thought the purpose of udev was to create device manager like 
functionality.  I posted my question here because udev is creating 32 nodes. 
  Udev gets that information from the kernel serial port driver.  Thanks to 
your explanation I now understand.  This is why I ask questions so I can 
learn.

I thought there were only 7 tty devices (Ctrl-F1 to Ctrl-F7) for local 
system login?  Ctrl-F7 being for Xwindows.  Did I miss something?
Thank you for taking the time to answer my questions.  I really appreciate 
it.
