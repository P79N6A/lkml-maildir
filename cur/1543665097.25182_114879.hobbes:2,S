Time for allnoconfig went down from 13s to 4s.
Time for allyesconfig went down from 44m to 59s.
Great!
The output is slightly less verbose, but that information wasn't too
useful anyway. Thanks a lot!
BTW: Your mailer did something horrible to the patch, and I had to fix
it manually. Hope it didn't break anything (i386 looks fine).
And mine appears to do the same. Better send it as an attachment until
I fix the cause. :(
