That depends on the architecture (i386, x86_64, arm, ppc, etc.),
compiler version (gcc 3.3, 3.4, 4.0, etc.), and kernel configuration
(single CPU, SMP, preempt, regparms, etc.). Kbuild knows about all
those things.

Create a file Makefile.kbuild with the usual stuff kbuild needs (see
http://lwn.net/Articles/21823/
 ). Then make an automake Makefile.am
file like this:
all:
	$(MAKE) -f ${srcdir}/Makefile.kbuild -C ${KERNEL_DIR} \
		M=${srcdir} O=${builddir} modules
Have configure.in AC_SUBST(KERNEL_DIR), and you should be set.
I haven't tested this, but I think it should work.
