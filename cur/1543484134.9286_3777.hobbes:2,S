What??? Wait... it's grow_inodes() and it looks like we never shrink the
damned icache again. Looks like it was always so with possible exception
of 2.1.36-2.1.42 when we used slab instead of bare pages. Damn. It's not a
leak per se - we just never shrink icache. Now, the fact that you managed
to grow it that large may mean that there is an inode leak, but that's
another story. What is the number of dirty inodes, BTW? They can't be
reused until they are cleaned.
