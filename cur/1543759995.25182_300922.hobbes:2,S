i would just like to add that its very disappointing that the LSM,
having been included in the kernel (apparently very much against
Christoph's and others' advice) turns out to be so useless. from
outside lkml, LSM appeared to be a mechanism to allow
non-kernel-developers to create new security policies (perhaps even
mechanisms) without trying to tackle the entire kernel. instead, we
are now getting a fix which, while it solves the same problem, has
required substantive analysis of its effect on the overall kernel, and
will require continued vigilance to ensure that it doesn't now or
later cause unintended side effects. LSM appeared to be the "right"
way to do this in terms of modularity - it is disappointing to find it
has so little support (close to zero to judge from this debate) on
LKML despite being present in the kernel.
