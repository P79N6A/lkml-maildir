Yes, that one is perfect. Now some more tests to do with the keyboard:
1) The same with i8042_direct on the kernel command line.
2) The same with i8042_direct and atkbd_set=3 on the kernel command line.
It may make the extra keyboards work and will definitely explain what's
happening in greater detail.
