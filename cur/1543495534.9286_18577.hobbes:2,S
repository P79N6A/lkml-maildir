For mount() we have it - see mount_sem usage.

Why bother with mount(8)? Check is fairly trivial - you are taking a
dentry of new mountpoint anyway, so you can just do the following:
error = -EINVAL;
for(foo=mountpoint->d_inode->i_sb;
    foo!=foo->s_root->d_covers->d_inode->i_sb;
    foo=foo->s_root->d_covers->d_inode->i_sb)
	if (foo == our_sb)
		goto no_fscking_way;
That's it. Now, problems with knfsd remain - they have nothing to loops...
Could you look at it?
