I've had problems under both 2.2.9 and 2.2.10, and I don't overclock.
Also, I don't think my system is overheating (I've got a PC Power &
Cooling "Turbo Cool" power supply and extra fans in the case).  I've got
an old 3.5" half-height Seagate Barracuda in the case, but it doesn't
seem to be too hot if I open the case and feel it.
I have been using "egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release)" to
compile my kernel (that's what comes with Red Hat 6.0).  I've seen that
maybe that is a problem, but right now (and I hate to say this since I
know my problem won't get fixed this way), I just don't have time to
"fiddle" since this is my work system, and I've lost too much time this
month as it is having to re-install Linux.  I've just stuck with 2.2.5
compiled with egcs, since it works.
When you work in a company that is a Microsoft Certified Solution
Provider, Technical Education Center, and more, there is a lot of
pressure to switch to Windows if your system has trouble and you're
running Linux.  I can't afford to have Linux fail again right now;
someone might re-format my hard drive while I'm out of the office! :-)

I don't speak for anybody but myself - that's enough trouble.
