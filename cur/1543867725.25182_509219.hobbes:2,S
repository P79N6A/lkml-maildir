But you still need several 'real' devices to separate data and meta-data 
blocks. DualFS does the same with just one real device. Probably 'data 
device' and 'meta-data device' names are a bit confusing. Think about 
them as partitions, not as real devices.

But we are talking about a different case. What I have said is that if you 
use two devices, one for the 'regular' file system and another one for the 
log, DualFS is better in that case because it can use the log for reads. 
Other journaling file systems can not do that.

If you have a RAID system, both the data and meta-data devices of DualFS 
can be stripped, and you get the same result. No problem for DualFS :)

I do not think so. The performance of DualFS is superb in meta-data read 
intensive workloads. And it is also better than the performance of other 
file system when reading a directory tree with several copies of the Linux 
kernel source code (I showed those results on Tuesday at the LSF07 
workshop).
