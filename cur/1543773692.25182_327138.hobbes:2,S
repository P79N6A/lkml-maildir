The problem is that they're mostly calls to library functions (strlen,
strcmp, fgets, etc.) so it's either the solaris way or the glibc way.
A (somewhat unclean) solution is to make the type change based on the
platform. Are there any defines present to test if we're in a Solaris
environment? I don't have access to any Solaris machines myself so I
can't really test.
