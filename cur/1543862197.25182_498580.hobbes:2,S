Yes, I saw that.

One of things I was trying to do with cpu_acct was to actually calculate
the % load over a defined interval. I have the patch for that ready.
When the interval ticks over (which happens in interrupt context -
account_xxxxx_time()), I want to reset the load of child containers
to 0. To walk the hierarchy, I have no root now since I do not have
any task context. I was wondering if exporting the rootnode or providing
a function to export the rootnode of the mounter hierarchy will make
programming easier.
Something like
struct container *get_root_container(struct container_subsys *ss)
{
	return &rootnode[ss->hierarchy];
}
