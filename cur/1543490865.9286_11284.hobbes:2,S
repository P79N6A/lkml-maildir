I'll make this quick:
Does any maintainer care that after upgrading the BIOS in my SuperMicro
P6DBE from 1.1 to 1.5a causes the memory sizing to no longer work? (ie, I
just couldn't figure out why my 196MB box was running so slowly today -
64MB is not a lot of ram).
If so, let me know and I'll help fix it up ....
G'day! <yes: mem=196608k works just fine>
