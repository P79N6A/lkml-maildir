Ok. Thanks for the explanation. Agree, ->rc should be left as is.

While I searched for typos and you're fixing them, au1550 owned 0x170000.
2.6.11-rc3 says:
	#define I2C_ALGO_AU1550 0x170000 /* Au1550 PSC algorithm */
So, I'd remove first two comments.
Oh, and the last note: current sparse and gcc 4 don't produce any warnings.
