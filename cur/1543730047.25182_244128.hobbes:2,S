Absolutely. But since the vast majority of the bugs in oprofile kernel
code are either identified or reported by kernel developers, it's really
that audience that need to do testing beyond what I'm outfitted for.
For example a while ago wli walked right into an obvious bug on one of
his machines that hadn't shown up during /any/ of my testing since the
code was merged.

Me neither. It would certainly be great to have a decent regression test
suite for OProfile, but I don't have one other than the usual by-hand
testing I do. Isn't there some STP thing or something at OSDL we can
get people to try?

I must admit I'm still not clear on when the equivalent of "early in the
2.6.x cycle" is going to happen again... I have no idea when, if ever,
call-graph OProfile would be suitable to merge.

That'd be handy certainly...
