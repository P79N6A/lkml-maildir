You are right of course. The MMUs first level descriptors force you to 
have 16MB pages.
I don't see anything wrong with using hugeTLB. Then it is up to the user 
to get hugetlbfs setup so that they can mmap(...) properly. This is 
forced on us by the designers of the MMU ;)
I think that is better than setting permissions during ioremap(...) so 
that a user space process can use a kernel virtual address for user 
space access.
