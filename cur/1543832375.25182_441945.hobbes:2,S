ps has some historical baggage in this area that probably ought to go,
but /proc/tty is used by various installers and management type apps so
shouldn't be going anywhere in a hurry.
Some of the stuff in there would be better in sysfs had sysfs been
around at the time. Other stuff like firmware loading in the serial
drivers would really benefit from a move to sysfs and hotplug events too
