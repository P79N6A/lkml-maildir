What hw bugs ? :-)
The driver is very fortunate. Based on DELs, only a few known hw bugs have
had to be worked-around by sym drivers. In fact, you can avoid most bugs,
by taking into account usual bugs in PCI hw. When I have made sym53c8xx
from ncr53c8xx, I had some clues in mind.
The 16MB/32MB boundary I pointed out can only affect sym53c896 rev. 1, and
only in not very likely situations. In plan to resurrect the work-around
in Linux sym_glue.c if pci_map_sg() will not want to handle the issue.
So, on paper, you were talking about a single unlikely to happen hw bug.

Will look into all these great things over the week-end and let you all
know my remarks if any.

Jen's seems to be a great and very courageous coder, so let me trust him
not to miss anything important. :)
Thanks for your reply,
  Gérard.
PS: Don't take the wrong way my statements against Sun stuff. In fact, I
    dislike almost everything that comes and came from them. :)
