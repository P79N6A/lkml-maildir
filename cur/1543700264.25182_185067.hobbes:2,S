Hi,
I have a doubt regarding the VLAN operation of the Standard Linux kernel
(linux-2.4.20).
My network setup is something like this:
---+---------------+------ VLAN ID 200
   |eth0.200       |eth0.200
+------+       +------+
|  HA  |       |Router|
+------+       +------+
                   |eth1.300
-----------+-------------- VLAN ID 300
           |eth0.300
        +------+
        |  HB  |
        +------+
When I send ping packets from HA to HB over the interface eth0.200, is
possible for the Router (using linux-2.4.20 with CONFIG_8021Q option) to
switch packets from VLAN 200 to VLAN 300?
Is this VLAN switching functionality supported by the standard linux kernel?
Is there some extra configuration, some patches or sources that can support
this feature for linux?
I would be a great help to me if someone could answer this or give some
pointers to this?
Thanks & Regards
Madhavi.
