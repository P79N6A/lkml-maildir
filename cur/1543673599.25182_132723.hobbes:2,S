Rgr..  That is the key.  You are seeing the same thing
as I have, and which is entered several times into the
RH Bugzilla.

The chain of the events (and my first encountering of the problem
was on 2.4.18 kernel) is:
RPM calls db4 environment open, which calls  pthreads-mutex
initialization, which fails...

------- Additional Comment #2 From Joe Orton on 2003-04-27 04:52 -------
This looks similar to bug 88178: I think the problem is that DB4 is
configured to use pthread mutexes in Shrike, but this depends on
pthread_mutexattr_setpshared working.  But it seems
pthread_mutexattr_setpshared only works with an NPTL-savvy kernel,
so DB4 doesn't work right of booting an old (or non-NPTL) kernel.
What might be that "NPTL-savvy" kernel ?
If your 2.5.69-mm4 isn't, it must be RH specific ?
