Point for me is, that with a DRM you could 100% verify that foreign
module Y is 100% from company Z. Or that binary product F is 100% from
the company and can be trusted to run here or there.
I think the major problem with DRM is the negative vibration it bringts
with its very stupid use in all kind of Mass Media Music/Movie industry.
Which is in a kind of ultimate end-of-its-days panic.
