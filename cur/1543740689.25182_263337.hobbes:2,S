ok, this should be fixed in -U9.2.

i have trouble reproducing this myself. Can you still trigger it under
-U9.2? If yes then could you check whether this still happens with a the
same .config but with CONFIG_SMP turned off? This smells like a locking
bug/breakage in the tty layer that we dont detect. You have all the
relevant debug options turned on, correct? (DEBUG_PREEMPT and
RWSEM_DEADLOCK_DETECT)
