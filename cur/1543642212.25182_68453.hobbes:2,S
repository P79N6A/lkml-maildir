   Yes, but Dave Millier claims that this patch is still broken, he says the
   fix needs to be in `ipc_kludge'.  I don't have access to my source tree
   until this evening, have you looked at this?
You didn't read David's patch at all, this is exactly what he is
doing, fixing the ipc_kludge declaration.
