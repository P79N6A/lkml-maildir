I've benchmarked my patch with a 2-pages-per-fault loop:
make allnoconfig
date >>aaa
make bzImage
date >>aaa
and then checked manually the time difference
Took the same time both on vanilla 2.5.66 and my 2.5.66+cowahead.
Perhaps it's better for other workloads...
ps. my posted patch had a little bug: it did the cow loop only 1 time,
    so it only cow'ed 1 page... be sure to change the end test if
    you want to benchmark it futher.
