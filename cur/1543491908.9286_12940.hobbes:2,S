I'm running stock RedHat-5.2 + kernel-2.2 + updates on a SPARCstation4
(sun4m), only trouble is NFS locking doesn't work against a Solaris 2.6
server, plus random X crashes (might be cured by latest XFree86 update?).
Here (i586 UP) I'm running 2.2.5 with egcs-1.1.2, glibc-2.1,
binutils-2.9.1.0.22b. No problems at all.
-O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -march=pentium
Hope this helps.
