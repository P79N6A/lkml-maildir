cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/suspend co suspend
and please read the HOWTO.  Unfortunately the RSA-related part hasn't been
documented yet, but it's pretty straightforward.
First, you need to generate the RSA key pair using suspend-keygen and save
the output file as /etc/suspend.key (or something else pointed to by
the "RSA key file =" configuration parameter of suspend).  This file contains
the public modulus (n), public exponent (e) and Blowfish-encrypted private
exponent (d) of the RSA key pair.
Then, the suspend utility will load the contents of this file,  generate a random
session key (k) and initialization vector (i) for the image encryption and use
(n, e) to encrypt these values with RSA.  The encrypted k, i as well as the
contents of the RSA key file will be saved in the image header.
The resume utility will read n, e and (encrypted) d as well as (encrypted) k, i
from the image header.  Then it will ask the user for a passphrase and will
try to decrypt d using it.  Next, it will use (n, e, d) to decrypt k, i needed
for decrypting the image.
Greetings,
Rafael
