I've noticed that they *ALL* have their From:, To:, and Subject: written in
uppercase. So it's really easy to filter them out depending on the tools used.
If a mail header either matches ^FROM:, ^TO: or ^SUBJECT: then it has high
chances to be a spam/virus. I checked all my recent mails and a few months
back in LKML and did not found anything except spam/viruses which match this.
At least, we should be lucky that these virus writers don't fully respect
protocols...
HTH,
