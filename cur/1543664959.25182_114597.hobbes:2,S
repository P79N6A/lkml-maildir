fs/ seems an obvious addition to me.  Could you cc linux-fsdevel on
anything you find in there?  Documentation/filesystems/Locking is not
too inaccurate and might help winnow the wheat from the chaff.
I think we'd benefit from the tty code being audited too --
drivers/char/*tty*

enabling/disabling interrupts is also a locking mechnism ;-)  When
you access data from interrupt context, you need to disable interrupts
to avoid that race.  So it's perfectly fine to do:
spin_lock_irq(foo);
spin_lock(bar);
spin_unlock(bar);
spin_unlock_irq(foo);
Also, are you modelling spin_lock_bh() yet?  That has a similar
function to spin_lock_irq() except it only protects against
softirqs/tasklets/timers, not regular interrupts.
