Is the WinXP client located in the same place where you are?
From my side the ISP that is giving me problems is xs26.net
at 2 different points. One is flapping and one is the link between them
and another ISP (i can't even reach it now) where pkts get seriously
delayed (from 100ms to more than 350ms) probably due to a slow link.
But what is seriously annoying is that xs26.net keeps announcing a network
that it can't reach, fscking the entire routing.
