Yes, indeed, I saw that. The idea here is, at the end, to propose a more
"userspace oriented" solution.
As we can't use msgget(), etc, API to specify an ID, I think we can at least
change it afterwards

In the general case, yes, you're right.
In the case of the checkpoint/restart, this is not necessarily a problem, as we
will probably restart an application in an empty "container"/"namespace"; Thus
we can create all needed IPCs in an empty IPC namespace like this:
1. create first IPC
2. change its ID
3. create the second IPC
4. change its ID
5. etc..
But yes, I agree that if we can directly create an IPC with the right ID, it
would be better; may be with an IPC_CREATE command or something like that if the
direction is to do that from userspace.
