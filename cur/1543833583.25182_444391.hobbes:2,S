Oops, I did not test it with suspend/resume stuff, sorry. The problem is that ehci_run is called
from resume without its counterpart ehci_stop in suspend, so notifier ends up registered twice.
David, Alan,
Do you think it is Ok to unregister reboot notifier in ehci_run before registering one to make
sure there is no 'double registering' of notifier, or is it better to move register/unregister
reboot notifier from ehci_run/ehci_stop completely to some other place ?
Aleks.
