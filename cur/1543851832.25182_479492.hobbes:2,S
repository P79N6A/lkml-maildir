You wanna bet? Use the newer P4 cores. A branch mispredict is over 20 
cycles, and I bet the "sti" isn't cheap either.
In other words, I suspect the difference between "popfl" and "conditional 
jump over sti" is basically zero - exactly because the sti isn't exactly a 
no-op.
(Enabling interrupts is actually much more complex than you'd expect. 
Interrupt delivery in a HT core is not simple in itself, and "sti" in many 
ways is actually more complex than "popf", because it has the additional 
"single-cycle interrupt shadow", ie the interrupt isn't actually enabled 
after the sti, it's enabled after the _next_ instruction after the sti. So 
from a uarch standpoint, "popf" is actually somewhat simpler.)
Anyway, what both you and Chuck seem to be missing is that trying to save 
a couple of CPU cycles is NOT WORTH IT, if it makes the code harder and 
more fragile. The "save eflags over context switch" that we do now is 
_obvious_ code. That's worth a lot in itself. And the costs of context 
switching isn't actually a couple of cycles - the real costs are all 
elsewhere.
