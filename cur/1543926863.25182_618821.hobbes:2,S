With this change we will see zillions of files being rebuild each
time we pick up another kernel version from git and friends.
For me it looks like this right now:
#define UTS_RELEASE "2.6.24-rc2-g99fee6d7-dirty"
committing my local changes made it look like:
#define UTS_RELEASE "2.6.24-rc2-g99fee6d7"
The above change will trigger a rebuild of all files
that reference UTS_RELEASE as will all WARN_ON users.
And this is with the default configuration.
So if we want this then we want to push that change to a
seperate function so we rebuild less files for simple changes.
