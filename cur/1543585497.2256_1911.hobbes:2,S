I wouldn't call it misconfiguration, just because it's a bit more difficult
to handle.
On the iontel side: You should watch out for matching APICs, voltages and
cache coherency (MESI) protocol. Actually, Deschutes and Coppermine just
work fine in spite of slightly different voltage.

It should be always legal to have the same CPU with different speeds. (FSB
must be the same for obvious reasons), e.g.. The TSC part of the patch
addresses this.

TSC is supported by both CPUs ... so why not use the nice rdtsc based time
routine.
The penalty:
It is 5 (20 bytes) ints more in the struct cpuinfo_x86, so you have
a kernel with (NR_CPUS*20 - 12) = 628 bytes more kernel data ...
Your bootup time may be a fraction of a second longer, as every CPU
calibrates the TSC on its own; OTOH they do it in parallel ...
The timer interrupt does an extra copy of xtime (2 ints) to the to the per
CPU struct. And one extra indirection for accessing the per CPU struct.
Something like 4 CPU cycles per timer interrupt.
gettimeofday() also has this extra indirection; OTOH not accessing global
data saves a cache line flush the next time the structure is written to ...
So this is probably a net cost of zero.

Thx! 
If you have some requests to make it suitable for -ac kernels, I'll do my
best.
