I had the same message:
Jan  3 23:40:15 jaipur kernel: kmalloc: Size (503808) too large
when trying to mount my NTFS partition under 2.2.0-pre4 after fixing
/usr/src/linux/include/linux/ntfs_fs_i.h to include the definitions
for ntfs_s* integer definitions.
After making the above change in ntfsendian.h, my NTFS partition mounted
properly.  Fixing the definition of NTFS_GETS8 fixed the problem in my
case.  Better get this change to Linus.
Thanks,
Ryan
