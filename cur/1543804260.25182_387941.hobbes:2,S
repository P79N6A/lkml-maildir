I posted the basic idea of this patch back on Dec 18, Steven came up with
his stuff about 2 weeks later, and it's a bit too creative with its use of
the preprocessor for my tastes,  so I didn't retrofit the idea.
On the other hand, I'm not *that* attached to my solution - if somebody wants
to code a patch Steven's way and toss it to Andrew, they're welcome to do so,
and we'll let Andrew decide. ;)
