That's *your* goal, it should not be a shock that users have a goal of 
using their systems without having to reconfigure them every time 
there's a kernel upgrade containing a security fix.

Is that a joke, or subtle irony? Do you generally validate drivers you 
don't use just because your hardware might be able to support them? I 
don't validate various accelerated video drivers on systems running 
mostly text console, never check sound options on systems with an audio 
application, etc. After I tried the e100 driver on the first few systems 
and found issues (which may be resolved by now) I went back to eepro100 
and used what worked. And used the driver for any new systems in other 
installs.
If there were any benefit to removing a working driver I would at least 
be able to see it as a resources issue, but as far as I can see you just 
seem to have a personal preference for the e100 driver and want to force 
others to use it because you are so much better able to decide what 
users need than the system administrators. That's one of the reasons 
people choose open source, because they have a choice, and can use 
what's best for them.
