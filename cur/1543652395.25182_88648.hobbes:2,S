Hi George,
I have a couple of small comments on the latest POSIX interface
patch (take 10 -- NOT HIGH RES).
1.  arch/i386/kernel/entry.S uses nr_syscalls and the patch
removes NR_syscalls from include/asm-i386/sys.h, but
user-mode-linux needs/uses NR_syscalls.  However, I see why you
removed it from sys.h:  it's basically a dead file.
And it looks like include/linux/sys.h shouldn't have that
#define in it (should be per arch).
2.  again in arch/i386/kernel/entry.S:  the added syscall number
/*comments*/ are off by 1.
