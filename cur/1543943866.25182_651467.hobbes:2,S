No amount of information about such a thing is too much information.  We 
do not need to do any more, but we can do more.
It is news, how about an entry in the kernel.org news section?  How 
about a security alerts section on kernel.org?  There is a lot that can 
be done to support people who want to patch their kernels as quickly as 
possible.
