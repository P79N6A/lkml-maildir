Well, this points out a serious problem with doing an mmap extension to
/dev/rtc. It would be better to have a page mapped by another device like
/dev/jiffy_counter, or something like that rather than to overload the
/dev/rtc with that functionality. The semantic for this change is shadey
in the first place so you should consider that option. It basically means
that, if Xorg, adopts this interface, no userspace applications can get at
and use the 'rtc' for any existing purposes with X running (mplayer and
friends).
It's not a really usable interface for Keith's purposes because of this
and it is a serious problem. You might want to consider writting special
device to do this like I mentioned above instead of mmap extension to
'rtc'.
