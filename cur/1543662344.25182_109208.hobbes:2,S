Subject: [PATCH][2.5.60 Trivial] Sysfs not handling show errors
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Attempting to cat a sysfs file that returns an error will result in an
endless dump of garbage to the screen because the result of the specific
show operation was being saved to a size_t (unsigned) and then later
checked for a negative value.
Here is a trivial patch to fix the error.
