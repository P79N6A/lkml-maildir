Hi,
usb-mouse
---------
In 2.2.19-pre6 (and previous) we had a CONFIG_INPUT_MOUSEDEV. It has
disapearead in 2.2.19-7. The only alternative for an usb mouse seems 
to be CONFIG_USB_MOUSE which is for an USB HIDBP Mouse.
So there is no mean to get mousedev & input compiled.
Maybe "Input core support" is missing with the matching ../drivers/input 
directory.
Iomega ZIP support
------------------
IOMEGA parallel port (ppa - older drives)
IOMEGA parallel port (imm - newer drives)
Have vanished from the "SCSI low-level drivers" sub-menu.
