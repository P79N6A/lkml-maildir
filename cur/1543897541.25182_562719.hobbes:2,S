Subject: [md-accel PATCH 00/19] md raid acceleration and the async_tx api
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Greetings,
Per Andrew's suggestion this is the md raid5 acceleration patch set
updated with more thorough changelogs to lower the barrier to entry for
reviewers.  To get started with the code I would suggest the following
order:
[md-accel PATCH 01/19] dmaengine: refactor dmaengine around dma_async_tx_descriptor
[md-accel PATCH 04/19] async_tx: add the async_tx api
[md-accel PATCH 07/19] md: raid5_run_ops - run stripe operations outside sh->lock
[md-accel PATCH 16/19] dmaengine: driver for the iop32x, iop33x, and iop13xx raid engines
The patch set can be broken down into three main categories:
1/ API (async_tx: patches 1 - 4)
2/ implementation (md changes: patches 5 - 15)
3/ driver (iop-adma: patches 16 - 19)
I have worked with Neil to get approval of the category 2 changes.
However for the category 1 and 3 changes there was no obvious
merge-path/maintainer to work through.  I have thus far extrapolated
Neil's comments about 2 out to 1 and 3, Jeff gave some direction on a
early revision about the scalability of the API, and the patch set has
picked up various fixes and suggestions from being in -mm for a few
releases.  Please help me ensure that this code is ready for Linus to
pull for 2.6.23.

Administrivia:
This patch set contains three new patches compared to the previous
release they are:
[md-accel PATCH 03/19] xor: make 'xor_blocks' a library routine for use with async_tx
[md-accel PATCH 05/19] raid5: refactor handle_stripe5 and handle_stripe6 (v2) 
[md-accel PATCH 06/19] raid5: replace custom debug PRINTKs with standard pr_debug
net/core/dev.c is touched by the following:
[md-accel PATCH 02/19] dmaengine: make clients responsible for managing channels
