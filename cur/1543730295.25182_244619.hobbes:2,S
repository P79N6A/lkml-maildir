Oh right... Yea, the code assumes that someone added the 4713 id (0x4713 ;)
) to pci_ids.h. Interesting that it runs out of memory though. The new
version does use quite a bit of GFP_DMA (== memory under 16MB since there's
no way of allocating memory under 1GB, which would do.). Apart from some
legacy ISA stuff I don't think anything else should be sucking it up, so
there should be enough, at least after a fresh boot.

Whew, maybe it's not a driver issue. Only thing I can think of is trying a
few different kernels (say 2.6.7, 2.4.x if that fails), acpi=off, pci=noacpi
on the command line etc.
