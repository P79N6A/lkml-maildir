Has anyone else seen extraordinarily large sizes in /proc/mtrr  
output?  We're running v2.6.24 on some Tyan S5383 dual-socket systems  
with the following characteristics:
  - qty(1) Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5345 @ 2.33GHz (quad-core, the other  
socket is unoccupied)
  - 32GB RAM (qty(16) 2GB DIMMS)
  - MTRR Discrete ENABLED in the BIOS
  - PCI Memory Hole set to 512MB in the BIOS (other options are  
256MB, 1GB and 2GB, all of which produce similar results)
  - CONFIG_MTRR, CONFIG_SMP and CONFIG_MCORE2 enabled
Here's some relevant output from a shell session:

I have a hunch that those 192GB+ sizes aren't "correct."  We're in  
communication with Tyan, and they say the MTRRs look OK from their  
end on a similarly configured system (using a utility unknown to me):

Here is the MTRR that we dumped from S5383 with 32G memory,BIOS SETUP  
for PCI memory hole 512MB and MTRR discrete ENABLED:

Although it's not running v2.6.24 at the moment, we also have an  
Intel S5400SF system exhibiting similar behavior:

We'll continue to work with the board vendors on this, but we wanted  
to get feedback from any MTRR experts out there.
Please CC me when replying.  Thanks.
