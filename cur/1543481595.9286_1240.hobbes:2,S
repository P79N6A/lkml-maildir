	This is where the analogy breaks down.  OSes are not life forms. 
They exists to serve our needs, cannot reporoduce without our help, and
the form of their genetic code, so to speak, is entirely within our
control.  I see no reason whatsoever why a *free* OS should hang on to the
bitter end.

	Then it is not the same species anymore.  Just because FluxOS is
made up of Linux sausage does not make it Linux, even if you call it
Linux.  By that token, I guess "Linux" will be around forever as long as
there is an OS that goes by the name of "Linux".  But this is semantic
nonsense.  When I say that Linux will be obsolteted by another OS within
two years, I mean more-or-less the current monolithic POSIX-compliant Unix
clone architecture of Linux 2.2 (and Linuxly also 2.3/2.4 as well).

	I never said that anything should be terminated.  Please do not
put words in my mouth.

	I didn't do that!  Why are you accusing me of this?  All I ever
said was that I thought that this would happen as part of the natural
evolutionary course of free OS development.

	You need to maybe proof your replies once before shooting them

	People have not even run out of ideas for horse-and-buggy
contrivances.  Are you saying they are not obsoleted by the automobile?

	The buggy vs. car analogy appies here too.

	Then it will obsolete itself.  My point is not that _Linux_ will 
dissapar as a name, but that the concept of a traditional monolithic Unix 
kernel will.  You gjust agreed with me, then.  Thank you.
