I am building a 2.2.12final3 right now and will retest with that kernel
but I had some strange results last night with a large file.
Download the 70MB StarOffice tarball into the / partition. Moved it over
to the /var partition. Noticed that the / partition did not release the
70MB. So I then moved it back to the root and noticed that /var did not
give up ITS space either and / was now showing 100% used.
I COPIED the file over to var and DELETED it from / and still showing 90%
used ... it freed up the space from the second file but still would not
free up the space from the first one that I moved out.
I am building a final3 and will reboot and retest to see if it is still
happening.
