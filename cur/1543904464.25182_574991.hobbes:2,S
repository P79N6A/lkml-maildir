Yeah, it's an ugly world we live in.  Would you be able to try the
attached patch just for testing?  It should sort devices with the
same _HID by their _UID.  It doesn't have any effect on my systems,
because my devices are already ordered by _UID by default.  But I
think it should switch your COM1/COM2 ports back to the order you
expect.
Yinghai, you mentioned the same issue on boxes with multiple root
bridges.  Any chance you could try this out there as well?
