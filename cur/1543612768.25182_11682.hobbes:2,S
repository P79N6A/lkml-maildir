Andre,
    Any chance of some further details on this work.  AFAIKT you've been the
foremost contributor of cutting-edge IDE updates for quite some time now.  I
find it astonishing that Linus would have inexplicably started refusing your
code.  At least point us in the right direction so we can try the new stuff
out.
Simon
