Yes, and one of my favorite things in BeOS too when I associate a specific
player to a file. But that's beside the point, in that this facility is more
general purpose than just adding properties for GUIs systems.
I primarily think of it through an pretty nasty object oriented POV and what
programmers can do with it coming from Hans Reiser unified namespaces (not a terribly
new idea, but badly needed) ideal. It's a legitimate theoryish computer science
pursuit, IMO and something I sorely miss in traditional Unixes.
