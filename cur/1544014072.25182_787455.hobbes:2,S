An ext3 file system that needs journal recovery sets one of the ext2
incompatible flags to prevent just that.

While you cannot have that, you'll need to dump the file system
(possibly with dd_rescue) to another medium and work on the copy.
That's what you should do anyways. ;-)
I think if you really want to mount the file system without journal
replay, you need to clear the needs-recovery "incompat" flag (on the
copy, obviously).
