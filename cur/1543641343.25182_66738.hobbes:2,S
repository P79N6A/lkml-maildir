Andrew had a new version that he just submitted to 2.5,
but it may not backport easily.
The agreement at OLS was to treat read and write seperately - 
nuke them immediately for one side, and reclaim under mem
pressure for the other. Half of Andrea's patch, and half of 
Andrew's. Unfortunately I can never remember which was which ;-)
And I don't think anyone has rolled that together yet ....
Summary: the code below probably isn't the desired solution.
