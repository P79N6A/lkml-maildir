Sure did and what I get was an explaination that, for
Linux, the letters "CDFS" refer to something that "exports
all the tracks and boot images of a CD as normal files".
That's not what I want. I want to mount a CDFS file-system.
Given that, maybe the explaination is bogus, but I
need some CDFS file-system support so I can mount
a Microsoft CDFS CD/ROM. If such support exists, I
would think that I should be able to do:
mount -t cdfs /dev/cdrom /mnt
Cheers,
