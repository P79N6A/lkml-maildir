Very nice. First manufacturer I've seen that gives out a spec. without

I've read the spec. and the command response type seems to be the only 
thing required. So protocol awareness is acceptable there provided there 
is a failure case for any unknown type.
For the command type field the driver should check the number of blocks 
and direction, not the command code. SDIO seems more difficult. But 
since we do not support that atm we still have the option of making sure 
any future implementations consider the needs of this hardware. I doubt 
there will be a need for checking command codes here either.
In summary, I see no need for protocol awareness other than response types.
