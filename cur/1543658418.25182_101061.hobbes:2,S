Not only endian-unsafe but also word-length-unsafe!
I certainly never imagined hash_mem would be a replacement for an
externally visible hash function such as those used by ext3.  Rather I
was wondering if one of those used by ext3 would be a suitable
candidate for hash_mem, and found that they weren't convincingly
better.

That's a shame.... It fills a similar purpose to full_name_hash in
dcache.h.  It might be nice to have just one function for internal
hashing of names.
The proposed hash_mem() seems slightly better than full_name_hash, and
much the same speed (Depending on how you measure it...)
Maybe full_name_hash et.al could be moved to linux/hash.h and I could
use that ...
My current preferred internal 'hash-a-string' function is:
static inline unsigned long hash_str(unsigned char *name, int bits, char term)
{
	unsigned long hash = 0;
	unsigned long l = 0;
	int len = 0;
	unsigned char c;
	while (likely(c = *name++) && likely(c != term)) {
		l = (l << 8) | c;
		len++;
		if ((len & (BITS_PER_LONG/8-1))==0)
			hash = hash_long(hash^l, BITS_PER_LONG);
	}
	l = l << 8 ^ len;
	return hash_long(hash^l, bits);
}
Given that we need to search for a terminator, using *(unsigned long*)
doesn't really help.
This hash_str could be used in place of the namei/dcache hashing, and
can be used where I need to hash a string.
Would anyone like to independantly compare it with:
		c = *(const unsigned char *)name;
		hash = init_name_hash();
		do {
			name++;
			hash = partial_name_hash(c, hash);
			c = *(const unsigned char *)name;
		} while (c && (c != '/'));
which is the comparable function from namei.c
