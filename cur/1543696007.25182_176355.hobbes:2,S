    Valdis> No, a paradigm is "a way of looking at things" or "a world
    Valdis> view".  So this would include paradigms like "the world is
    Valdis> flat" or "monolithic kernels are preferable" or "gcc is
    Valdis> the only compiler for the kernel".
Actually "paradigm" has both meanings -- it may mean "example" _or_
"framework."
