Yes, if you are smart enough to do this you could also edit the oops
report or even patch nvidia licence tag etc. It's just a help to
the kernel developers to sort out newbie bug reports, nothing more.

There is no internal kernel function being called in order to 
initialise this flag. insmod just sets the value of the symbol, it
doesn't call a kernel function which could make an entry into the logs.
However, insmod can and should IMHO syslog this.

See Documentation/oops-tracing.txt and Documentation/sysctl/kernel.txt
(in 2.4.19-rc2 at least).
