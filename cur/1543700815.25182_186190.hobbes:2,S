Still I don't see why we shouldn't simply return EINVAL if a user is
trying to something obviously stupid - assuming full coherency in
application is a somewhat common thing and there's better things to waste
time on.  And yes while we could support coherency for arbitrary mappings
I agree it's a bad idea - but there's a huge difference between just
checking arguments and adding the large extra complexity of supporting
arbitrary combinations of addresses for mappings.
