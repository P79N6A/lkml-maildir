i doubt it helps any -- except for benchmark-only purposes.
there's a description of the 32-bit T-table approach in section 7.3 of 
<
http://fp.gladman.plus.com/cryptography_technology/rijndael/aesspec.pdf>
basically the tables are 8-bit -> 32-bit maps, and there are 4 of them (2 
for each direction).  to go to 64-bit you'd need 16-bit -> 64-bit maps... 
512KiB per table.  there are some other variations on the tables which are 
smaller, but nothing as small as the 1024 bytes per table of the 32-bit 
implementation.
there's a completely different approach using bit-slicing (basically 
consider each register as 64 1-bit registers), which yields great 
throughput but cruddy latency -- you basically need lots of non-dependant 
streams to make this pay off (i.e. it might work for disk crypto 
processing multiple blocks simultaneously).
