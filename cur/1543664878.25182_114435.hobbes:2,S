You appear to be strugling with the same problem I have. What I find is
that the multicast application binds to the loopback instead of ethernet
interface (also no IGMP joins are send out on the ethernet interface).
Can you please check the output of 'netstat -n -g' and see if the
multicast address shows up at the correct interface?
Various people have provided hints on how (and in what order) to setup
the interfaces, but uptil now I have not been able to receive any
multicast data with 2.5 kernels.
It would be nice to know if anyone is able to join multicast groups on
2.5 kernels. Especially for applications that don't bind to a very
specific interface, but leave this choice to the kernel.
