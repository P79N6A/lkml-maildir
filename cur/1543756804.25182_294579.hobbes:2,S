Hugh,
Thank you immensely for answering this so clearly.  Although it leaves
me at a short end, I am grateful I no longer have to bang my head in
this direction any further.  I have wasted a HUGE amount of time in
recent months trying to figure out why different kernel versions caused
my applications memory footprint to change so.
That said, many mod_perl users are *VERY* interested in being able to
detect and observe how "shared" our forked children are.  Shared meaning
private pages shared with children (copy on write).  Is it even possible
to do this in 2.6 kernels?  If so, any pointers would be very helpful.
Thanks again,
Richard F. Rebel
