Okay, you are changing the formula for the optimal number of free 
pages in a zone. Ideally, this should depend just on the zone size, 
but really, it also needs to consider the rate of intr-context 
non-waitable allocation requests that may be generated (this is
probably where the "min" value comes in?)  And maybe 
some performance considerations (is that the logic for a "max" 
value?)

In 2.3.42, freepages.* is still used in kswapd, right? I believe we 
should try to kill that usage, and make kswapd zone aware ... I sent
a patch to Linus about this.

Only when ZONE_BALANCED returns "zone-not-balanced", do you need to do
classfree(). classfree() might return "zone-is-balanced" though. If 
ZONE_BALANCED says "zone-is-balanced", classfree() will never say 
"zone-not-balanced". That's the optimization ...
I don't think ZONE_BALANCED is a big deal, but my experiments with zone
balance tweaks on a 16Mb box have left me paranoid of any changes in
these parts. As you mention, its _probably_ better to kill it ...
