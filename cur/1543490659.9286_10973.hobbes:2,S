I can't be on the bleeding edge of the OS...  2.2 was just released and
it already has three dot releases.  I don't have time to deal with
upgrading a kernel and everything else for a machine that I physically
can't get to because its on another continent.  If I botched it, I would
be a real unhappy camper so I'd rather stick with the 2.0.x kernels if
at all possible...  Atleast until I have time to upgrade and test the
2.2.x locally...
