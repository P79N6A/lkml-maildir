Well, this is happening when reading the log up from disk during
mount, we will be asking for somewhere around 32K of data at a
time, but it might not be well aligned. I will instrument it and
report back - will be a few hours, the box is at work and I just
tripped it up in some other code, I cannot reset it from here.

Since it is down I cannot give you the ide boot messages right now,
but it is a Tyan Tiger BX motherboard using the built in IDE chipset,
so pretty generic stuff.

It's a scratch box, all it does is run development kernels and tests,
I am keeping 2.5 in a cage right now.
To answer your other question Jens, yes I can reproduce at will,
once I go in to the office.
