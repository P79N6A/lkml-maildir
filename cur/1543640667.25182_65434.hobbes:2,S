Hi,
I am writing a device driver for a pci card i know that whenever u r writing a interrupt handler there are some restrictions. like u cannot acquire a lock, u can't sleep but i want to know, is there some restriction like i can't use buffers which i have allocated through vmalloc. actually i allocated some structure through vmalloc in init_module() and referencing them in interrupt handler will that create some problem.
Thanks in advance
