Subject: 2.5.75 - very poor GUI (KDE Kicker) feedback time

Mandrake 9.1 (KDE 3.1.0) mostly unchanged, 2.5.75. Kicker is configured to 
enlarge icons on mouse over - now it takes several seconds to do it. Clicking 
on an icon in Kicker again takes several seconds before I get visual feedback 
and application starts to load.
It needs several seconds before tooltip appears after passing mouse over an 
icon in Kicker - and often it stays there as if mouse leave event has been 
lost.
Not sure how to even start debugging this, any pointers appreciated.
TIA
