I don't have any benchmark numbers yet, so I can't explain the
effectiveness with numbers.  I've been looking for the way to
measure the cost of pzones correctly, but I've not found it out yet.

I guess you are referring to the situation that global memory is running
out but there are free pages in pzones.  These free pages in pzones are
handled as reserved for pzone users and not used even in global memory 
shortage.
