Yes .. of course .. but please don't tap some words (without this kind 
comment) which sounds like rules [1]. *Especialy if* talk is about *one* 
specified piece of hardware. Moving discuss from one point to full 
population many people takes as plain trolling. Luben looks like SAS 
specialist and if you drive discuss outside SAS area this must be 
confusing for him .. and not only for him. And also .. SAS controlers 
this is not '"cheap" market'.
[1] look at comments at /. and osnews:

look how many people without proper knowledge level assumes: Linus is 
authoritet -> Linus says "spec is close to useless" (without looking on 
context) -> .. probaly spec is realy useless. Of course it is blind 
repeatig but case like this may ruine many thing aroud Linux .. and 
forgive me: you must be aware all this.
Thank You, sorry and regards
