Heh. These improvements look fine, but I definitely don't want to first 
apply the broken one and then improve upon it - it would be much nicer to 
get this kind of nice "progression" patch that starts off from a clean 
thing and just improves on it (maybe that ends up meaning just one patch 
to replace Kirill's, I don't know..)
