OK, I was able to reproduce at least the problem with I/O apparently
never completing on my smaller test machine.  I've been assuming this
was related to whatever was causing the BUG_ON().  But in case it
isn't, I'm going to continue to look into what's going on on the running
system and I'll let you know what I find.
In the mean time, once you've generated a patch, I'll give it a try
as soon as I get it.  I'll also pass it on to the dbt2 workload guys.
