Hmm, is this the old "non-standard sector alignment" problem ?
Some CDs have their directory sector entries exceed the sector, and AFAIK
the problem is that they exceed it not entry by entry,
but in the middle of a directory entry, which violates the ISO9660 spec.
The Linux CD-ROM driver used to have a workaround for this,
but then after 2.0.x it seems to have been removed.
Why ???
After all Windows perfectly accepts these broken (ISO9660 wise) CD-ROMs.
I don't know whether 2.4.x still has the same "feature" that 2.2.x had.
A Spanish language training CD of mine has this problem, and I can't read
several files on it.
Hmm, or maybe your problem is simply that you forgot to enable the
"hidden" mount option for your CD-ROM ??
(some files are burnt with "hidden" attribute !)
