The bisection narrowed in on an innocent patch in ipv4 space.  Meanwhile
the rush of patches continues.  When I retested yesterday when Linus
HEAD was 8af03e782... the CONFIG_SMP=n kernel worked perfectly.  So
maybe it was fixed?  Or maybe the bug depends on the relative
location of various bits of code/data and as the kernel grows and
shrinks with incoming changes the problem comes and goes :-(
