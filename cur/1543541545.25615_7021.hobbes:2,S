I do think that the approach works from a technology standpoint, but I
cannot honestly say that I think this is even remotely "user-friendly".
I actually think that Linux with the stuff that is going on in 3D,
desktops etc has a chance to become the first real user-friendly UNIX.
Gnome is looking mighty fine these days if you just have the memory, and
on the whole things look quite nice.
I'd much rather have an implied mount happen automatically (if the forks
are to be done with a mount-like internal implementation) for the user
when he encounters a file with forks. So that people can just write
scripts etc, and without the user having to care about the details.
