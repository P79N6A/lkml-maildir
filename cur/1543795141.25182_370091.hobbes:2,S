Subject: [Patch 0/6] Remove Deprecated PM Interface from Obsolete Sound Drivers

Hi there.
This is a series of 6 patches that remove the old, deprecated power
management interface from a variety of old OSS drivers, most of them
marked OBSOLETE and scheduled for removal in January 2006.
These patches facilitate the removal of the ancient PM interface by
reducing the number of in-kernel users to 3:
	drivers/net/3c509.c
	drivers/net/irda/ali-ircc.c
	drivers/serial/68328serial.c
Of the drivers affected by these patches, the following are marked
OBSOLETE:
	- cs4281
	- cs46xx
	- maestro
	- nm256
The following is not, though there seems to be a corresponding ALSA
driver:
	- opl3sa2
The ad1848 driver is used by several OSS drivers. This may be the most
controversial removal.
Does any one have any objections to these patches?
Thanks,
	Pat
