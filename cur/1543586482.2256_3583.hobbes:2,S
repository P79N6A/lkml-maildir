Hi Richard,
You are correct and I freely admit that I have problems in communication
on paper, but do better in person as you found out, I hope.  I think I
will do what most every one else does is drop from lkml and only deal with
direct mail.
Also it was good to meet you this weekend.
Cheers,
Andre Hedrick
