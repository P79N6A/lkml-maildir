Well, if you plan to post PPC related patches, please do so on
the linuxppc-dev list (or CC it at least) so we can know what you
are doing. We do maintain a linuxppc-2.5 bk tree which is regulary
merged with Linux but contains our up-to-date fixes for PPC.
It compiles and runs most of the time (thanks Paulus for maintaining
it)
Ben.
