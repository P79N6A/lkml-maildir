Which is problematic, because cpuset_cpus_allowed ->
guarantee_online_cpus restricts the task->cpus_allowed mask to cpus
which happen to be online at the time of the call to
sched_setaffinity.  If more cpus come online later, that task can't be
migrated to them.

It's not.

I think it could reasonably be interpreted as all bits in the mask are
set unless the task's affinity has been modified.
