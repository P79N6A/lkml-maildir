Subject: [PATCH] Cleaned /dev/epoll patch ...

The /dev/epoll patch has been cleaned and slightly changed :
1) moved the file callback list handling from fs/file.c to fs/fcblist.c
2) moved the functions definitions from include/linux/file.h to
        include/linux/fcblist.h
3) renamed the patch from /dev/poll to /dev/epoll ( event poll )
4) renamed the devpoll.c(.h) files into eventpoll.c(.h)
5) configuration variable from CONFIG_DEVPOLL to CONFIG_EVENTPOLL
6) fixed a locking issue on SMP
7) kmalloc/vmalloc switch for big chunks of mem
8) increased the maximum number of fds to 128000 ( maybe I'll change this to be
        unbounded )
9) changed device MINOR to 124
