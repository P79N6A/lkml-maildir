Right, if "C" means "strictly conforming ISO C" to you.
(in which case, nearly all real-world code is broken)
FYI, the kernel also assumes that a "char" is 8 bits.
Maybe you should run away screaming.

Right, it gets much worse with the current gcc snapshots.
IMHO you should play such games with "g++ -O9", but that's
a discussion for a different mailing list.

Nope, unless we decide that the performance advantages of
a language change are worth the risk and pain.
