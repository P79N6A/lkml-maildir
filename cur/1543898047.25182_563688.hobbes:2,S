This is purely a guess, backed by zero evidence.
These network drivers were hand-tuned to use tasklets.  Sure it will 
WORK as a workqueue, but that says nothing equivalence.

Network driver patches welcome :)

Completely false, at least in network driver land.  Threads existed and 
were used (proof: 8139too, among others).
Kernel threads were not used for hot path network packet shovelling 
because they were too damn slow.  Tasklets were single-threaded, fast, 
simple and immediate.  Workqueues today are simple and almost-fast.
