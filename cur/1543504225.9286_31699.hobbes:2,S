The driver got HZ/100 when running the device driver on an x86.  It's
most likely that those drivers were only ever tested on an x86 with HZ
== 100.
Unless the driver is still being actively maintained, it's irrelevant
what the original author wanted.  Any change made now should make the
driver behave the same as it always has done because that's all that's
been tested on real hardware.
