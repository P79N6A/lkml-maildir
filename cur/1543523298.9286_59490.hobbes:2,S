    My name's not Dave.
    But as for /dev/sdq...
root@downbelow# ls -l /dev/sdq
ls: /dev/sdq: No such file or directory
root@downbelow# ls -l /dev/sdq*
ls: /dev/sdq*: No such file or directory
root@downbelow# 
    I presume that /dev/sdq will be living on Yet Another major to get
    around the bizarre type-of-device numbering of scsi devices?  I'll
    just start shuddering now and avoid the rush.

   So the output of /proc/devices will be out of date if an rmmod is done
   just after the code trawls over the registry entry for the offending
   device.   Is this important?

    No.  That's a pretty awful scheme there.

    david parsons \bi/ so now I need to make a zillion system calls to figure
                   \/     out which major is affiliated with which hdx device?
