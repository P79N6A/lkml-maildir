It is our position and we believe that it is supported by the BKL license
that it is the right and authority of the original creator of the project
to enforce any license they so wish.  If Linus wants to make it clear
that if you make changesets using BK that the checkin comments are also
GPLed, that's his right.  That's our intent and that's what we believe
the license says.  See clause 3(b).

That's because we haven't shipped bk-3.0 yet, we expect to do so this
week.  The license clause has been there for a long time, these rules are
part of the BKL.  However, we only recently added the "click to accept"
stuff for the extra license and the lawyers tell us that is required to
be enforceable.
