I have noticed this behaviour as well with any newer pre 2.4 kernels on a Compaq Proliant 3000 
with a Smart2-DH controller and, just recently, with test9-pre7 on my home system.  It always 
happens during high disk activity.  The problem I have is that usually it starts scrolling several 
pages of errors (or plain garbage) and I cannot get enough to submit any useful information.  
One system is SCSI (the Proliant) and one is IDE, so I cannot even limit it to that.  The only 
commonality that I can see is that there is always high disk I/O when the panic occurs.
