   Actually I'm victim on over inlining too. Was at least.
   I was running some router on old Pentium's. I remember almost 
dramatical drop of performance with newer kernels because of inlining in 
net/*. But sure on Xeon P4 it boosts performance...
   Actually what I'm about.
   We have classical situation when we have mess of representation and 
intentions.
   Representation == 'inline', but intentions - 'inline or it will 
break' _and_ 'inline - it runs faster'.
   This obviously should be separated.
   even more.
#define INLINE_LEVEL some_platform_specific_number
---------
#define inline0 inline_always
#if INLINE_LEVEL >= 1
#  define inline1 inline_always
#else
#  define inline1
#endif
...
#if INLINE_LEVEL >= N
#  define inlineN inline_always
#else
#  define inlineN
#endif
    and so on, giving a platform chance to influence amount of inlining.
    better to put it into config with defined by platform defaults.
