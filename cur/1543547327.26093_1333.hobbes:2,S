You dont want it in kernel space. Not unless you plan to lock uid/gid access
and make them atomic. Think about things like file operations where the uid
changes under you on another CPU as you walk a directory tree checking
permissions.. 
Quota looks even more horrible.
Its also very rare and not a performance case to push into glibc
