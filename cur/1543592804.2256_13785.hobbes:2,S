Where in the man page does it state this?  I just read it and couldn't find
any such statement.
I do, however, find the following:
       exceptfds will be watched for exceptions.   On  exit,  the
       sets  are  modified in place to indicate which descriptors
       actually changed status.
If there is a time out, it makes sense that no descriptors changed state,
and so everything would be zeroed out.
And actually, the example seems to support this:
           if (retval)
               printf("Data is available now.\n");
               /* FD_ISSET(0, &rfds) will be true. */
The comment seems to indicate that if retval is 0, then FD_ISSET will be
false.
