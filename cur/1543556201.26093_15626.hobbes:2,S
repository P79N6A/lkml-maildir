Not necessarily - it all depends on what your driver does.  In many cases,
supporting 2.2 and 2.4 is easy, and all you need are a few #if's.  It's
certainly much better to have a dozen or so #if's sprinkled throughout the code
than to have two separate source trees, and have to make the same change to
multiple files.
Kernel drivers that are not easy to maintain simply delay the release of each
kernel version.  Besides, code is back-ported from 2.4 to 2.2 all the time.
