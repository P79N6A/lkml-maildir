Subject: Trouble compiling 2.3.39 (also 2.3.40-6) with Athlon support..

Hello, tried compiling both 2.3.39 and 2.3.40-6 with athlon support both
failing. I also tried searching archives for similar case but found
nothing.
Maybe there's something with my setup but setting processor config to PPro
kernel compiles just fine.
Any hints?
System is Athlon 500, Asus K7M, 64Mb memory and ver_linux gives:
