This patch causes the depth specification to be retained when we release 
commandblocks.  Since releasing command blocks is supposed only to be done 
when we give up the device (and therefore, is supposed to clear everything), 
your fix looks like it's merely masking a problem, not fixing it.
Is the real problem that this controller is getting a release command blocks 
and then a reallocate of them after slave_attach is called?  If so, that's 
probably what needs to be fixed.
