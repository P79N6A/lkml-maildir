Heh, good. Well, the mode spec should work in fact, provided that you
get the syntax right, though I haven't tried. I'll have a look later,
but if it doesn't work, then it was always broken and it's not a
regression :) I still want to fix more stuff in this area, but for now,
I'm concerned mostly about regressions.
Can you remind me exactly what's up with the backlight control ?
Ben.
