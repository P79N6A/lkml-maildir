Hi,
I've nailed this down to something that happened in 2.6.17-rc4. The
system locks up with either a NULL dereference or an unhandable paging
request. The stack trace shows this:
paging request            NULL dereference
_raw_spin_trylock+12    _raw_spin_trylock+20
__spin_lock+22
main_timer_handler+22
timer_interrupt+18
handle_IRQ_event+41
__do_IRQ+156
do_IRQ+51
default_idle+0
_spin_unlock_irq+43
thread_return+187
generic_unplug_device+0
default_idle+45
dev_idle+95 (I can't read the func clearly in this handwriting)
start_secondary+1129
I'm guessing this is the same problem only that it once manifests itself
as one and another time as the other. The problem is in the call to
write_seqlock(&xtime_lock) from main_timer_handler().
I've not been able to determine what patch has caused this to happen,
but it is between 2.6.17-rc3 and -rc4. I'm bisecting, but if anybody has
a good candidate, it'd probably be faster than doing a complete bisect.
