Oh geez.  Couldn't you have split out the various data items into 
separate xattrs?  This seems to be a really bad user interface, 
especially for writing (can't chmod the file without poking at all the 
other data items), except for a non-DOS-based filesystem to keep data 
for Samba itself.  Samba clearly has other needs than other users, 
although of course it would be unfortunate if Samba then can't export 
this information.
In other words, I'm inclined to define simple system attributes or just 
go back to the original ioctl() patch for the DOS filesystems as seen by 
the kernel.
