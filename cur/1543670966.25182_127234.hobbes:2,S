  In addition to all the points you covered, you also have to figure
out what to do if the log medium fills up or fails.  In a high security
environment the only thing you can do is panic the system immediately,
because (unaudited) bad things might already be happening.  You also
have to configure the system so it will not boot into multiuser
mode if the log has failed.  (And *then* you get to deal with clueless
admins who will disable that feature in their desperation to get
the system up and running, but that's not really a technical problem.)
