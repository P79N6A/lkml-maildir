So, time to ask the question.
I've been thinking for the past couple of weeks of hacking at the
different users of netlink and trying to get everyone to play nicely
together - if we're pushing things like connector, why can't we make
this a general solution? (read: why do uevents have to be seperate?
why are we forced to a particular protocol number with connector?
etc.?).
