It appears to work (even with the reiserfs patch with the obvious
Makefile tweak), but the drm modules have unresolved symbols:
root# modprobe mga
/lib/modules/2.4.0-prerelease/kernel/drivers/char/drm/mga.o:
unresolved symbol remap_page_range
/lib/modules/2.4.0-prerelease/kernel/drivers/char/drm/mga.o:
unresolved symbol __wake_up
/lib/modules/2.4.0-prerelease/kernel/drivers/char/drm/mga.o:
unresolved symbol mtrr_add
/lib/modules/2.4.0-prerelease/kernel/drivers/char/drm/mga.o:
unresolved symbol __generic_copy_from_user
/lib/modules/2.4.0-prerelease/kernel/drivers/char/drm/mga.o:
unresolved symbol schedule
