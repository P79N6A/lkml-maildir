..And once thats done and the tree settles a bit I'll start working on
the swsusp2 x86_64 port again. (Unless someone who understands that
whole thing better wants to jump forward.)
FWIW I ported the 'old' pmdisk suspend code into swsusp2 and I can
suspend, but I can't resume. I haven't got a serial port (its a "modern"
laptop.. with parallel, etc but no serial..) so I'm also looking at
netconsole, digging around for a line printer, etc..
