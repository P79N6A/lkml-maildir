Why would you allocate memory on a resume transition? 
As for suspending, this is something that has been discussed a few times 
before. No definitive decision has come out of it because it hasn't been 
implemented yet. It hasn't been implemented yet because the infrastructure 
isn't complete. It's real close, but still not quite there. 
Nonetheless, you have to do one of a couple things: use GFP_NOIO or
special case the swap device(s) so they don't stop I/O when everything
else does. (Of course, you have to eventually stop it)
Check the archives; there are lots of ideas there wrt this topic. But, 
there are bigger fish to fry in the meantime ;)
