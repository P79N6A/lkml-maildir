Imho,
Given that the filesystem is still 'experimental', I'd concentrate on
getting it stable before worrying about immutable and xattrs unless
they are easy.  (Immutable is easy).
In 13 years of using Linux in all sorts of ways I've never yet to use
either feature.  They would be good to have, but stability in a
filesystem is much more useful.
I'm biased of course: if LogFS were stable and well tested, I'd be
using it right now in my embedded thingy - and that doesn't even
bother with uids :-)
