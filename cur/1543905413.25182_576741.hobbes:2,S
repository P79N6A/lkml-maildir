Hey All,
    Thanks a lot for the replies. I have the development keys. But the
algorithm and some intellectual property needs to be licenced from the
4C entity guys to implement it. As of now I just want to test the CPRM
functionality. So licensing the algo for a prototype testing is a huge
cost.
   That is why I was looking for an already implemented solution -
hardware/software - so that I can just test. If it does not suite our
needs, then I have just paid for a chip only and not for a whole
license.
  Seems like there is no other way out than shelling out money for the
license. :(
Thanks anyways,
Midhun.
