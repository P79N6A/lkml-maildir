Hahah so true so true ... but all gods fall if their worshipers stop

So ... there are ways. Root is only given this power because it is 
allowed that by the operating system kernel. It is always possible to 
shunt root out if the kernel chooses to do so.   We can actually 
construct environments where security officers != system administrators.
