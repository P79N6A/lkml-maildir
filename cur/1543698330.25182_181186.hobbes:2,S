Whenever The ABI Question (TM) comes up, it seems to be about claiming a
(binary compatible) interface - mostly for modules. But I think it's
widely accepted that there isn't much work done to have these truly (sp?)
binary compatible (eg. UP/SMP spinlocks et al.).
Of course, we want to have a somewhat stable interface for libc (->
userspace), but some struct (fb_info, ...) doesn't need to be binary
compatible - as long as a driver (given to be in source) still works
cleanly with it:)
