Just some ideas:
1. Put 'em on t-shirts.
2. Read aloud to non-technical people as a cure for insonmia.
3. As song lyrics (just like the DeCSS decoder song).
4. Put 'em on wallpaper.
5. Print 'em on toiletpaper.
6. Print, shred and dispose as a was of disinforming dumpster divers.
I'm sure that the community can come up with more :-)
