Other than the minor little fact that -mregparm=n exposes several latent
compiler bugs, that since it is not part of the ABI, it isn't on anybody's
radar screen as needing to be fixed.  This is of course the downside of free
software, that volunteers tend to have their own ideas of what to work on.
Also note, that for -mregpar=n, it is important that variable argument
functions be declared properly in all callers, since they need to use the
standard calling sequence.
