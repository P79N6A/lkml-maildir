Given the background, the most likely cause would seem
to be bad a CPU/motherboard connection. I have
realised that the APIC error is for CPU1, but I have
actually removed CPU0. And a bad CPU0 would explain
why "nosmp" didn't work either.
It's a pity that "nosmp" doesn't (logially cannot?)
take a "boot CPU number" as a parameter.

Not any more. Everything started to hit the fan at the
beginning of August, and I thought that I had
"patched" things by underclocking the FSB. However,
that only seems to have delayed the inevitable. CPU
slot 2 on my motherboard just seems not to work any
more. I have no idea why - it's not like I can see a
lot of dust and dirt in there.
Oh well, I hear that Dell are selling dual 2.6 GHz
Xeons with RedHat preinstalled nowadays. (These should
have "hyperthreading support", right ;-) ?)
Cheers,
Chris
