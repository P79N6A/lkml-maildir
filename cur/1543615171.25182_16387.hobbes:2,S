Hi!
I'm making a new filesystem (
http://efat.sourceforge.net
 -> despite the
name it has nothing to do with Microsoft FAT variants) and I want to
know where can I find info about what is supposed to have in a Linux
Filesystem Driver... (what entry points, what must they do, what kernel
I/O facilities are available, these info that comes about OS/2 in the
IFS document and about WinNT in the Microsoft IFSKit)
Regards
