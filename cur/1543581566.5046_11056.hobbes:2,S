First of all, I'm sorry to be so late to answer,
but we had problems with our mail server, last week (damned NT.....) :=(((
I know that some (maybe a lot..) of the FA311 cards work well with the 
natsemi driver.
I know that some doesn't work, also. In fact, I don't use a FA311 card,
but a DP83815 Chip included on a motherboard.
And, in my case, the driver fails....
I started to work on the SiS900 driver.
I will try to do something about it...
Maybe it won't be quick,
because I'm not used to work so deep inside the kernel,
but it's a good time to start ! :=)))
So, please be patient, I'll come back with something new,
one of these days...
Jocelyn Mayer.
