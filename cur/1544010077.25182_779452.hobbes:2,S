This patch set ports cpu buffers in oprofile to the new ring buffer
provided by the tracing framework. The motivation here is to leave the
pain of implementing ring buffers to others. Oh, no, there are more
advantages. Main reason is the support of different sample sizes that
could be stored in the buffer. Use cases for this are IBS and Cell spu
profiling. Using the new ring buffer ensures valid and complete
samples and allows copying the cpu buffer stateless without knowing
its content. Second it will use generic kernel API and also reduce
code size. And hopefully, there are less bugs.
The patch set is also available here:
