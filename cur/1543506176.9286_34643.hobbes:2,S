Hi Steve,
> Are you back permanently now?
Yes.  I moved, got a new job at a startup (which takes lots of time),
and I bought a new computer to replace my lame 3-hours-to-compile-a-kernel
486.  Now I have a Sony Vaio PCG-F250 laptop, fractional T-1 connectivity
through work, and it's a nice kernel hacking machine.

I am running into weird behaviour with objcopy.  I think this is going
to be a patch that requires a new version of objcopy, maybe so new that
it won't exist until I file some bug reports with the binutils people.
That definitely makes it 2.5 territory.
