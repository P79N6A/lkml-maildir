Debian slink (Currently frozen, hopefully will be released soon) is
mostly 2.2.x ready, there are a few issues (As I'm quite sure there are
with the other dists) such as DHCP which may not function properly..
However a number of the developers (myself included) have been running
2.1.x kernels for a while, and even more who are now on the 2.2.0 pre
kernels..
However if you run into any problems with Debian related with the 2.2.x
kernels feel free to drop me a note, and I'll see what I can do to help.
