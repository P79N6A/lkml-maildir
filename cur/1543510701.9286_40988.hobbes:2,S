But the advantages are that it forces clueless lusers to learn a lot more
about the differences between Linux and a certain shrink wrapped product
from a certain company in Seattle, and teaches them the concepts and
advantages of in open source software. The more literate people becomes,
the more they know, the less they can have the wool pulled over their eyes
by the likes of Micro$not.
I'd rather have more literate people and less clueless people out there.. 
Cheers,
