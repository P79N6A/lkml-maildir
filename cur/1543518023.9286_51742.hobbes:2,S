That's partly because the development model of XFree86 is less open than 
that of the Linux kernel. 
Also, I don't know if I'm a representative sample, but it took me a lot longer
to find my way around the XFree86 source enough to be productive than it took
me to find my way around the kernel source.
I think that for these reasons, along with others, the Linux kernel gets more 
feedback and patches from random users than X does.
(Please no flame war about the openness of XFree86 development - 'less open' 
is all I said).
