nice!

I guess it should be moved to input.h with other types of events.

what about moving this long comment to Documentation/input/uinput.txt?
the rest of the patch seems fine to me
thanks,
(p.s.: sorry for the delay and the dup that will follow. my server is
offline due adsl problems and the first answer is stuck there :)
