One issue here is Nagle--you'll definitely want to turn that off, and
I don't think you can do it from the server side.  Also, I think SSH
does its own batching of keystrokes, to decrease the overhead of the
crypto encapsulation.  So this part seems like a hard problem without
a cooperating client.

You're not going to be able to do that with network connections, only
locally attached keyboards.
