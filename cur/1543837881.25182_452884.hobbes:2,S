Yeah, sorry - this is almost certainly due to the increase in NR_IRQS.  It
made this, in include/linux/kernel_stat.h
	DECLARE_PER_CPU(struct kernel_stat, kstat);
really big and we consume all the per-cpu memory.
NR_IRQS is (sometimes) calculated from NR_CPUS via complex means.  Reducing
your NR_CPUS should fix things up.
