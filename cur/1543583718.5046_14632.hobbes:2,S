There will be no change whatsoever with me.  The existing ABI is
fixed.  If you want your programs to behave different set the mode
appropriately.  I have not the slightest interest in seeing
applications (including the libc) being broken just because of this
stupid idea.  No kernel and no libc modifications necessary.  This is
the end of the story as far as I'm concerned.
