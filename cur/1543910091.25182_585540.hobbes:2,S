How do you measure this?
If you want to have something done every 300 microseconds, you must not 
sleep for 300 microseconds in each iteration, because you'd accumulate 
errors. Use a periodic timer or use the current time to compute how long 
to sleep in each iteration. Take a look how cyclictest does it.

Don't forget the process will always have non-zero wakeup latency. It 
takes some time to process an interrupt, wakeup the process and schedule 
it to run on the CPU. 10-30 microseconds is not unreasonable.
