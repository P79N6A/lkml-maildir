Could you try reverting aic7xxx-deadlock-fix.patch?  Also, add
initcall_debug to the boot command just so we know we aren't blaming the

Apart from that, gosh.  Maybe you could add just linus.patch and
bk-scsi.patch, see if that hangs too?  Or just test the latest linus tree -
the scsi changes were merged this morning.  Thanks.
