Sorry, I am afraid, I caused a bit of confusion here. 0x29b6 I had when 
BIOS configuration was set to "IDE". Then I couldn't use the 0x29b6 at 
all, and therefore couldn't access the external eSATA disk at all. Then I 
switched to AHCI, now all SATA hosts are on PCI ID 0x2922 and 0x29b6 is 
also there as an IDE host unused...
So, now BIOS is set to "AHCI", all SATA hosts - internal and external are 
on PCI ID 0x2922, and external needs a minute to start up, but then it 
works fine.
Thanks
