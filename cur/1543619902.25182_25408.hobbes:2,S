Ok, the reason I'm asking is that I receive a request from a remote machine on interrupt level
(tasklet) and want to submit this to the local device. The reason I'm using a tasklet instead of a
kernel thread is that somewhere between RedHat's 2.4.3-12 and 2.4.9-12 kernels the latency of waking
up a kernel thread increased (using a semaphore method similar to the one used in loop.c). I don't
know why this happened, but I guess that if I still could use a kernel thread there wouldn't be any
problems using generic_make_request().
