I do not have this device so I cannot test it, but your logic seems
correct.
This is a much nicer fix for the preempt-related issues than others
proposed, too.
Anyone out there who _can_ mount the device?  Can you test this?  It
ought to be merged if it works.  We need to get device drivers in 2.5 up
to par..
