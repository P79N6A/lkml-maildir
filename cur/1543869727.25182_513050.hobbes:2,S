Why do you need another time stamp them?

Only if your app cannot handle time going backwards.

Not that many, but some probably. 
Letting the kernel do the time stamping is usually quite useless anyways. 
You can as well do it in your application when you receive it. After all
you're interested in when you can read the packet in your app, 
not when the driver processes it.
The kernel time stamping is mainly for sniffing applications that want
to know exactly what's going on on the wire. But even then it's fairly
arbitary because it can be a long time between the packet arriving 
on the PHY and being processed by the driver.
