Can you ask them to contact me?

Indeed... It's a catch-22. The current driver is correct; default clock
rate is 125 MHz. Luckily, for the case that specific implementations
use different rates I did build in the default_xclk=-1 and default_mclk=-1
options, which make the driver not to touch the clocks.
But that still breaks the default. Do you know someone elso who has an
ibook, or any other PowerPC M1? If the 50 MHz is consequent on all PowerPC
implementations, we could perhaps make it 50MHz on PowerPC only as
emergency fix.

Same problem for me :)
I did post the driver on the Linux-fbdev and LinuxPPC mailinglists.
Replies: 0. I also asked you, you didn't have time, no problem, but again
no test. It gets merged, people start testing...
I agree the stable series should have a stable driver, I proposed that
Marcelo would merge the driver, I would aggressively investigate problems,
and in case of serious trouble a revert.

It's a possibility, Alexander Kern is porting the code to 2.6. But
please wait a few days, it's quite likely things will be fixed and stable then.
