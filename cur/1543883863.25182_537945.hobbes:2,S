We have __attribute_used__ for this, but the implementation looks whacky:
it's there for gcc-3 but not for gcc-4 and the intel compiler.
But it looks like the gcc-3 version is there to iron over a gcc
implementation glitch.

Of course, one could do 
	int type = pci_direct_probe();
here instead, but that's a bit fragile.
