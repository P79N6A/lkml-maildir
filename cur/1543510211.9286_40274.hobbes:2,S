Oh yes, very much indeed. If you are writing data to a buffer
descriptor in PCI shared memory space, there is no reason to do every
single write synchronously when all you want is to make sure that all
data is there before you issue the `send' command to the adapter.

Depends on your architecture.

Well take a look at it, it's actually quite neat -
