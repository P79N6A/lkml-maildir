Right, if it were a sleep point, I agree.
But my understanding is that down_trylock()
is not one of those: isn't it used for conditionally
acquiring the semaphore? That is, if  semaphore available,
get the semaphore, otherwise don't bother?
And a quick check reveals __down_trylock is used
only in down_trylock path, not by down() variants
which can sleep.
