Your mail is still hanging in my inbox, and unfortunately I don't have
the complete schematic for the parkbd adapter anywhere near me.
I was hoping I could find it, but I suppose the following might be
enough for you to build the adapter:
It's really simple, just two diodes and two resistors in this
arrangement:
            ______
+5V -------|______|--.
                     |
INPUT PIN -----------|
		     |--- KBD PIN
OUTPUT PIN ---|<|----'
Now for KBD CLOCK you use STROBE and ACK pins on the parallel port and
for KBD DATA you use AUTOFD and BUSY pins on the parallel port. I don't
remember the value of the resistor used, but something like 5k should
work OK. It's not completely necessary anyway.
And then you'll also have to connect the keyboard +5V and GND pins. For
+5V you can either use the real keyboard or mouse connectors, get +5V
from the joystick connector or from an external power supply.
