This is 2.6.6-rc3 on sparc64. It has recently got some new warnings in
NTFS (there was a warning before but now there are more):
fs/ntfs/super.c: In function `parse_ntfs_boot_sector':
fs/ntfs/super.c:638: warning: long long unsigned int format, s64 arg (arg 4)
fs/ntfs/super.c: In function `ntfs_fill_super':
fs/ntfs/super.c:1523: warning: cast to pointer from integer of different size
fs/ntfs/super.c:1529: warning: cast to pointer from integer of different size
fs/ntfs/super.c:1634: warning: cast to pointer from integer of different size
The 3 new warnings are because of this definition:
#define OGIN    ((struct inode*)le32_to_cpu(0x4e49474f))        /* OGIN */
This seems suspicious - hardcoded pointer?
