i think fortunate might be a better word.  comparing the two:
struct atm_skb_data {
        struct atm_vcc  *vcc;       
        int             iovcnt;    
        unsigned long   atm_options;
};
struct inet_skb_parm
{
	struct ip_options {
	  __u32         faddr;
	  unsigned char optlen;
	  unsigned char srr;
	  unsigned char rr;
	  unsigned char ts;
...
}
surprising you only run into trouble on some 64bit platforms.  at this
point the atm_vcc* overlaps with optlen and chaos ensues.  on a somewhat
related note, i believe iovcnt is probably obselete.  skb's support
scatter/gather.

this is one option.  the other would be to clone the skb and pass the
clone to the ip layer.  the last option, and the one i prefer, would
be to make the atm drivers not modify skb->cb (or reset it) when passing
up the skb.  the atm socket layer doesnt rely on it, and it would keep
the 'extra' processing to a minimum.
