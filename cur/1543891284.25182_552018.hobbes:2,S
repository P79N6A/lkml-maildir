Something I'd really love to have is a CONFIG option to decide if
slub_debug is set or not by default.  The reasoning behind this is that during
development of each Fedora release, I used to leave SLAB_DEBUG=y for
months on end and catch all kinds of nasties.
Now that I've switched it over to using slub, I ended up adding the
ugly patch below, because otherwise, no-one would ever run with
slub_debug and we'd miss out on all those lovely bugs.
(I have 'make release' and 'make debug' targets which enable/disable
 this [and other] patches in the Fedora kernel).
(Patch for illustration only, obviously not for applying).
Unless someone beats me to it, I'll hack up a CONFIG option around
this. Having that turned on if !CONFIG_STABLE would also be a win I think.
