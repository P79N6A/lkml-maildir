Hi! I upgraded to Linux 2.6.0 yesterday. After a whole bunch of false
starts, I've got most of my system up and running now, with the
following problem:
I Use a Logitech Wireless Desktop MX keyboard/mouse set, and I've found
that my "Messenger/SMS" and "Shopping" buttons have ceased to work.
showkey in a console tells me nothing about the keys (no output when
these keys are pressed) - all I can get is the following kernel
error/warning messages:
Shopping:
atkbd.c: Unknown key pressed (translated set 2, code 0x12c, data 0x14, on isa0060/serio0).
atkbd.c: Unknown key released (translated set 2, code 0x12c, data 0x94, on isa0060/serio0).
Messenger/SMS:
atkbd.c: Unknown key pressed (translated set 2, code 0x11d, data 0x11, on isa0060/serio0).
atkbd.c: Unknown key released (translated set 2, code 0x11d, data 0x91, on isa0060/serio0).
I wouldn't be too bothered about this if it weren't for the fact that
the keys /also/ don't work in X - X doesn't register the presses, and
looking in dmesg, I see the same errors being output.
I realise that someone's posted to the list about this problem before,
but I found no answer that really explained how to fix it. The one reply
seemed to indicate the use of setkeycodes, but the error message gives
me no real hint about a scancode I can use.
Both keys used to work fine in Linux 2.4.21 - I was using the
Messenger/SMS button to change the DPMS timings on my monitor so I could
have it turn off/on at a buttonpress in X.
I'm running Debian GNU/Linux unstable; the bulk of the system is up to
date as of a week or so ago (but I expect this isn't all that relevant).
