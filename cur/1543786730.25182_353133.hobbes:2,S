I haven't diagnosed this further and it only ever happened in the SUSE
kernel to my knowledge (no one has reported it to me for the vanilla
kernels + suspend patch).
So lets just keep this patch out of the equation for now, it could be
that other SUSE patches broke something in this area :/

ata_do_simple_cmd() always blocks anyways, so I don't see the point.
Perhaps rename the function to ata_execute_and_wait_simple_cmd().
