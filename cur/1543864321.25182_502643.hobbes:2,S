Does it find sys?  If so perhaps I should do something even more significant.
I guess if I get many complaints about this I will figure out how to print
out an appropriate error message.

It is supposed to fail in this instance.  If you want something under /proc/sys
you are supposed to use register_sysctl like everyone else.  If it's not a
sysctl it should not show up under /proc/sys.
I think I fixed the one in tree instance of this behavior.
I'm glad to see my cleanup uncovering more bugs, I'm sorry you were the one
who had to find it.  I will you well fixing your out of tree ipfilter module.
