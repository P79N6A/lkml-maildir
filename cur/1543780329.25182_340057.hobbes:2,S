are you sure you are seeing this with the -52-14 patch? If yes then 
please send me your .config.
the build error showed a more fundamental bug, which had to be solved 
differently. The problem was the code in route.c, the problem was this:
 # define rt_hash_lock_addr(slot) NULL
 # define rt_hash_lock_init()
where NULL has no type. The solution for the build problem would have 
been to cast the NULL to spinlock_t *, but we need this spinlock so the 
correct solution was to add a || defined(PREEMPT_RT) to the #if 
defined(CONFIG_SMP) line above. Solving the build problem alone only 
fixes the symptom, not the bug.
