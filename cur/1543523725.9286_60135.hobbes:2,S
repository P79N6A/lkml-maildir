While i've been working with the linux kernel, i've noticed some definate
performance bottlenecks in its implementation, and one of them is the incredible
lack of lock granularity.  While there has been some improvement in
2.3.40, i just ran a simple grep to find the calls to lock_kernel, and
found  451. I was wondering if there are any groups out there that are addressing
this problem specifically, or any general strategy for addressing the number
of global kernel locks? (Especially since some of them seem to be used
with relatively orthogonal things... ;-)
