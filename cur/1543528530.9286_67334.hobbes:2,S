There is a point at which you say 'fuck it' and filter because
the cost of trying all those possibilities has become too great.
It's much like doing support. You'll happily handle x number
of the same stupid question. But when that number surpasses x
you're not going to give the same quality of responses. Hence
the 'RTFM' and 'RTFFAQ' responses (and why a FAQ gets created.
ppl get tired of the same questions over and over again. they
wish to move on and get on with their lives... ofcourse the
person at the other end mostlikely sees their problem as unique).
