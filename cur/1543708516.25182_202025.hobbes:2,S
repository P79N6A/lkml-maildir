The strongest example is that Andrew Morton always "fixes" whitespace
as patches go through his tree.  It's about 50 lines of code, and it's
not slow (but has definite room for optimization).

There's no documentation I could find for "O=", BTW.  I'm not even
sure what it does...

Right. 8(

I was thinking of the driver author.  Driver consists of three .c
files, and a local .h file.  They want to catch anyone touching any of
these files.  But they don't want the sum to change just because
someone adds a new inline function to linux/kernel.h.
If it's impractical, we can just skip all the headers.  But it would
be a real loss.

Um, sizeof() vs strlen().

Yeah, I love GCC.  It's also in ISO C, BTW.

Ack.
Thanks!
