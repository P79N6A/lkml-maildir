No. That doesn't make sense for network-based filesystems. You don't
want a single RPC credential to be shared among all the users, since
that requires the client to choose one that is 'the correct user auth
for reading this file'. If you have some sort of uid/gid mapping, ACLs
or --worse yet-- des/kerberos style authentication, then such a
selection is not obvious. (Imagine if the kerberos token suddenly
expires)
As for holding the file handle in the address_space structure, then
this becomes equivalent to placing it in the inode structure if I
correctly read the scheme you're proposing. This has been discussed,
and the concensus was that it won't work well against Linux servers,
since they encode at least some path info in the file handle. You
don't want your entire inode coming down with a bad case of '-ESTALE'
because somebody on the server deleted the hard link associated to the
fhandle you happen to have selected.
Under Linux, the fhandle is more properly associated to the dentry
rather than the inode.
Cheers,
