What happens ift he whole thing is cooled so much that it stops functioning?
What if the part that is supposed to do the system suicide is shot away?
There are all kind of interesting ways of bypassing such protections, I
wouldn't count on covering all of them (which doesn't mean you shouldn't try).

How many devices there are doesn't matter, a RSA key is ten times as big
as an AES key anyway. But maybe you've a more complex system where having
multiple keys indeed isn't possible (e.g. the filesystem is shared between
multiple devices).

Not if you put it in initramfs included in the kernel binary.
Depending on how much room you have on the secured flash area,
you'd want to put as much as possible there anyway.

Well, as the filesystem isn't restricted you should be prepared for anything.
Is the RAM in restricted area or not? Because if it isn't and they have
access to the bus then it can be tampered with.

I've nothing against your RSA implementation, it's one of the cleaner and
smaller ones. Merging it is probably a good idea to stop others and to have
a minimalistic reference implementation.
I've problems with the assumed security it brings to many uses of it though.
Depending on the expected lifetime of your product I'd also consider using
something that can't be broken by quantum computers in the (near?) future. ;-)
Good luck,
Indan
