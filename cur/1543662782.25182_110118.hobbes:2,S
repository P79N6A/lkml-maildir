Yes, something is wrong with the CPU scheduler.  Simple test case:
	./tbench_srv &
	while true
	do
		./tbench 4
	done &
	cd /usr/src/util-linux
	time make -j4
The tbench activity takes the time to compile util-linux from 13 second to
133 seconds.
But that is not the whole story.  The compilation appeared to make no
progress at all while tbench was running - it was only in the gaps between
ending one tbench run and starting another that the compilation did anything.
When I changed the load to one instance of
	while true
	do
		./tbench 2
	done
	and one instance of
	while true
	do
		./tbench 3
	done
the compilation made no progress except for those rare instances when the two
shell scripts were restarting the tbench run at the same time.  After a while
the scripts fell itno synchronism, and the compilation took 260 seconds.
Conclusion: tbench completely starves the `make'.
It mainly seems to affect uniprocessor builds.  SMP was much better behaved.
Adding the sched-f3 patch basicaly fixed it all up.  The 133 second build
came down to 55 seconds, and the compilation was visibly making progress
during the tbench runs.
