Argl, this has "silent failure" written all over it. No, I think
single-field granularity wouldn't incur excessive overhead: at
run time, you can trivially handle adjacent fields with a single
copy, and I don't think there are really that many practically
useful fields that setup cost (CPU or memory) would be terrible.

Hmm yes, about as bad as I remember it from my psmisc days :-(

That would the the least of my concerns. If you really run out
of memory, you can always fall back to an iterative process.

Cute ;-) But it might be faster just to dump the whole data,
and let user space worry about picking the right entries.
