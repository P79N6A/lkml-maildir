Subject: [PATCH] kd_mksound inclusion on PPC
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Marcelo,
On PPC, we have many platforms which don't have an ISA timer chip and
on which therefore the default _kd_mksound does the wrong thing.  This
patch changes drivers/char/vt.c so we can use a config option,
CONFIG_PPC_ISATIMER, to control whether we get the default _kd_mksound
or not, rather than including it on all PPC machines.  (The
CONFIG_PPC_ISATIMER is derived from the user's choice of platform
support, we don't ask about it explicitly.)
Please apply this to your tree.
Thanks,
Paul.
