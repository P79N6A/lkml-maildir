Hm, no, we still deal with patches, and unless Thomas had added that to
his patches, we would not have seen it.  He was asking us to pull a git
tree :)
I guess I need to write up a "best way to deal with the stable tree"
type email and send it out to try to remove any confusion here.  But
that will have to wait until tonight, it's a nice day out, a rarity this
time of year, and I'm supposed to not be working today, time to go take
the kids and play outside...
