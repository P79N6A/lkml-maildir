I'm fairly sure this isn't going to happen. Unless you're telling me
that irqs run for 50ms plus.
What is more likely is that you are seeing some starvation from simply
too much CPU usage by interrupts (note this has nothing to do with latency).
*This* is the reason ksoftirqd exists.
ie. you are seeing a throughput issue rather than a latency issue.

ksoftirq doesn't alleviate any kind of latencies anywhere AFAIKS.

softirqs won't normally run in another thread though, right?

Yeah I don't think it is anything close to the same concept of
softirqs though. But yeah, "just" running top half in threads
sounds like one of the issues that will come up for discussion ;)
