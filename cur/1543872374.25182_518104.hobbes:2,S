I just gave the reason why I designed it the way it is now. If you 
really feel it needs to be changed, well, I don't really object to that. 
chaostables has only seen like.. 1 1/2 version announcements (urls to 
tarballs, no patches) to mailing lists, and except for the few users who 
definitely tried it (based on questions I received), there have not been 
any suggestions for changes yet, which either tells me that nobody is 
interested or everything is fine.

I see. Thank you for the link. I think you are on the way to have me 
convinced.
