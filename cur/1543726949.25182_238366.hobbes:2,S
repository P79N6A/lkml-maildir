Okay the people who are interested in the future of the DRM seem to be
fairly evenly split between dri-devel and linux-kernel mailing lists,
I'm not going to subscribe to lk (I've been there and I quite enjoy having
a life :-), and I know a fair few lk people won't want to join dri-devel
as DRM isn't the only thing going on there...
So is there a requirement for having a drm mailing list? I'm sure fd.o
will oblige if I ask, I expect it to be fairly low traffic with mostly
patch and future directions discussions...
If anyone thinks this is a really bad idea let me know, otherwise I'll
probably start the ball rolling before the end of the week..
Dave.
