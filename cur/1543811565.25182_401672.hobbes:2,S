How can something as widely used as sound not work from one kernel version 
to the next, as seems to be implied with the "private" nature of the ABI?  
This is a total cop-out and is IMHO very amateur of the developers.  If 
something like this is to be the case, at the very least the alsa libraries 
need to provide a stable ABI and be shipped with the kernel.
