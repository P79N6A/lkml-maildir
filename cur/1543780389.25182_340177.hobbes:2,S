No good idea anyway. X does, of course, not "include" these files, but
they are reused. I don't want to maintain two different versions of the
files.
Furthermore, I have a quite big sisfb update in the queue which I intend
to submit after 2.6.13 is out. It, amongst others, removes a lot of 2.4
related stuff.
It's best to leave it alone for now.
