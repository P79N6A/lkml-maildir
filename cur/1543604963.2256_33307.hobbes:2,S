Plus, the most significant part is to the left, as in "42", "3.1415",
"17:23", "1.1.1.2", etc.  This does not only makes it sortable, but also
consistant and logical.  Why should dates be the only exception?  The
problem with three letter month abbreviations is that they are language
dependant, and a bit hard to sort chronologically.
[Insert your favourite Mr. Spock quote about logic here!]
