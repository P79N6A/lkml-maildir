Well, one of the instrumentation patches which I use detects a
scheduling overrun at interrupt time and emits an all-CPU backtrace.
You just feed the trace into ksymoops or gdb then go stare at
the offending code.  
That's the easy part - the hard part is getting sufficient coverage.
There are surprising places.  close_files(), exit_notify(), ...

Yes.  They can be very bad for really large directories.  Scheduling
on the found-in-cache case in bread() kills that one easily for most
local filesystems.  There may still be a problem in ext2.
