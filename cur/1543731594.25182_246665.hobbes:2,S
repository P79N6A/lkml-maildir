I received mine just one day too late... And I guess I'm not the only one. 
The fact that I bought it especially because of Linux support after trying 
3 other cams last week, adds some irony to ease the bitterness. :)

Yes. I assume it's all the stuff that contains the word 'decompressor'. 
Such as:
-       pdev->decompressor = NULL;
+       /* Find our decompressor, if any */
+       pdev->decompressor = pwc_find_decompressor(pdev->type);
You can easily do a diff between the previous kernel version and a more 
recent one without the hooks.
Here's the patch that removed the whole driver:
http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.6/gnupatch@412d8e0cqutBsdGubqorXXCeHHdS2g
You can reverse-patch this and then do a diff compare between the tree and 
the pwc-9.0.2 package. Or find the patchset that removed the hook.
A quick look with diff shows changes in:
./pwc-ctrl.c
./pwc-if.c
./pwc-uncompress.h
./pwc.h

Do email Philips customer support though. Let them know you use linux, 
bought their product and want a driver.
