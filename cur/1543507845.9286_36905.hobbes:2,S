What I'd like to see is a variant combining both methods, which would
result in something like the following algorithm:
 1. Scan the config file for standard directories to search. For
    each one found, search it for the required module, stopping
    with the first one found.
 2. If the required module isn't found in any of the standard
    directories, scan the config file for a config statement
    naming a base directory, then do a full tree search from
    that directory for a matching module.
 3. If the required module still hasn't been found, scan the
    config file for a "last resort" directory statement, and
    search in that directory for the module.
 4. If the required module still hasn't been found, report an
    error.
In theory, all modules would be found using step (1), so steps (2)
and (3) would only get used for modules which are not in the expected
directory for some reason. As a result, this would minimise the 
overhead incurred.
Best wishes from Riley.
