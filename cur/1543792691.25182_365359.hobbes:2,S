Umm, references are implemented as pointers.  Instead of a "zoo of
pointers" you have a "zoo of references".  No functional difference.

Not true at all!  If you're storing references you absolutley still need
reference counting.  Allocation non-trivial things on the stack is Bad
Idea in kernel land.
