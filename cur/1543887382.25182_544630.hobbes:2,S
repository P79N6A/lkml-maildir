Subject: [PATCH v2] pcmcia: ppc64 needs 32-bit ioaddr_t

ppc64 really needs ioaddr_t to be 32-bit, since I/O beyond the
first PCI bus might be mapped at a higher range.
While the type is exported to userspace, there hasn't been any platforms
with PCMCIA on 64-bit powerpc until now, so changing it won't regress
any existing users. Besides, those interfaces are overdue for removal
already.
