The A7M266-D is infamously picky about the PSU, about the DIMM quality
and about the heat handling. Its one of the reasons I suspect that the
dual athlon didn't get AMD into the enterprise market - goes like a
rocket, requires space shuttle grade components and produces as much
heat.
I am using dual cpu and two dimms (ecc, registered). Contrary to the
docs I've never managed to get it stable with 3 dimms.
Also make sure you use a recommended PSU, many 400W PSU's don't
produce the right amount of power on the right voltage lines.
