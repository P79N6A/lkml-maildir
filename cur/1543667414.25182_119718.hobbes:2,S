But these patches can be easily postponed to the next release and now
we can release just the bug fix as you did in the 2.2 series.

No, I asked you for reasons against, you gave me (except for the first

Do you really think that "People should either use vendor kernels or
read LKML and be able to gather the fixes from there themselves" is a
good strategy?
				Have a nice fortnight
