I'm not a lawyer, but I don't see why you'd want the copyright notice
in the executable:
 * It's probably the source text that you're intending to copyright, not
   the binary executable bits.
 * If you look, I believe you will find that there are almost no other
   copyright strings in the vmlinux executable.
 * By what right can I copy or distribute a kernel built with this string
   in it?  The comments in zlib.h let us use the source, but I don't see
   any authorization to use the resulting executable bits on which this
   static copyright string seems to assert copyright.
