Okay please imagine that kernel initialized all hardware and,
now, what shall it do instead of mounting root fs and starting
$INIT?
You want a "prompt where I can either shutdown or reboot the system".
How to do that? It is best done from small userspace environment,
like initrd or initramfs. Putting this into kernel is ugly.
