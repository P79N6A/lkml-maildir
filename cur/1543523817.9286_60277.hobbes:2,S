I found 2.3.39 cannot recognize my ISA supra FAX modem correctly.
previously, I used 2.3.16 and that handle the modem without trouble.
But when I tried to use ppp connection using 2.3.39, it produces
following error:
Jan 28 21:16:39 matx pppd[201]: pppd 2.3.9 started by root, uid 0
Jan 28 21:16:39 matx kernel: LSR safety check engaged!
Jan 28 21:16:40 matx kernel: LSR safety check engaged!
Jan 28 21:16:40 matx chat[202]: Can't get terminal parameters: Input/output error
Jan 28 21:16:40 matx pppd[201]: Connect script failed
Jan 28 21:16:41 matx pppd[201]: Exit.
Actually, I cannot 'cat' /dev/ttyS1 by the same error.
I put 'printk' into every inb/outb in drivers/char/serial.c and saw
the difference between 2.3.16 and 2.3.39.
Then I noticed that the problem may exist before serial.c was called,
because the first printk corresponding ttyS1 port in serial.c produces
different values.
Does anybody tell me what should be checked next step or I missed something?
