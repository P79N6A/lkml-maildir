It is not a broken BIOS! The BIOS timer that ticks 18.206 times
per second has an ISR that, in addition to keeping time, turns
OFF the FDC motor after two seconds of inactivity. This ISR is taken
away by Linux. Therefore Linux must turn off that motor! It is a
Linux bug, not a BIOS bug. Linux took control away from the BIOS
during boot.
