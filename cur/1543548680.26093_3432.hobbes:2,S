I think something like this: (I don't know the current code, so maybe
this suggestion is really stupid.....)
struct request_queue {
	int4	start_time;
	struct request *list;
	struct request_queue *next;
}
struct request_queue *current_queue;
function too_old (struct request_queue *q) {
	/* can actually easily be implemented using time, nr of requests
  	   or any other messure of amount of work */
	if (current_time > q->start_time + MAXTIME)
		return 1;
	else
		return 0;
}
function insert_request(struct request *new) {
	struct request_queue *q=current_queue;
	if (new->sectornr < current_sector);
		q=q->next;
	while (too_old(q))
		q=q->next;
	insert_request(q->list, new);
}

I don't think you should allow merges. If one process is doing a big 
IO operation on a big file it would still get _all_ capacity, right?
