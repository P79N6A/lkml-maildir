I don't think it's quite as deep down as all that.  I built cat.c with
some additional debugging fprintf()s in it.  When I run it from the
text console, it tells me that the variable <outsize> is 4096
(derived from #define ST_BLKSIZE(statbuf)  <about 4 different #defines>.
However, when run from an X terminal window, it tells me that outsize
is 1024.
I don't have time right now to dig into the 4 #defines for ST_BLKSIZE
to see where the problem is.
Anyway, it looks as though the kernel read function for /proc/net/dev
is filling up cat's buffer and just stopping, which seems OK to me.
Looks like a cat bug IMO, but I haven't finished looking at it.

OK.  Loading dummy driver multiple times is OK for this.
