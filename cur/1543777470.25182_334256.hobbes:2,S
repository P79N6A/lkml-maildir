And I'm incredibly frustrated by this insistence on hard data when it's
completely obvious to anyone who knows the first thing about MIDI that
HZ=250 will fail in situations where HZ=1000 succeeds.
Do you really consider this "theoretical whining"?

It's straight from the MIDI spec.  Your argument is pretty close to "the
MIDI spec is wrong, no one can hear the difference between 1ms and 4ms".
