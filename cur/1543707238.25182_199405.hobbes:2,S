A minor point. It is not necessary for the src to be clean because a
parallel truncate can also invalidate the src. Actually, my test program
uses truncate to invalidate the src.

Yeah. Andrew's patch is lot cleaner than my _crap_ patch.

Yeap. Andrew's patch fixes the problem. I did put in a printk along with
Andrew's patch to check whether the NULL src condition repeats. I could
trigger the condition again, and the machine didn't oops because of the
patch.
Thanks,
