Yeah, but it also ruins your locality of reference (in a NUMA sense). 
Not convinced that's a good idea. You're guaranteeing universally consistent
worse-case performance for everyone. And you're only looking at a situation
where there's one allocator on the system, and that's imbalanced.
You WANT your data to be local. That's the whole idea.
