It looks like tha ALSA pci drivers properly do the MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE
stuff, and I have the proper entries in my modules.pcimap for my sound
cards.
What driver are you using that you do not see this working for?
And pci drivers do not get automatically loaded by the hotplug
subsystem, unless you insert the card _after_ userspace is up and
running (like for a PCMCIA or pci hotplug system.)
