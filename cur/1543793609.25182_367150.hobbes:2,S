register_netdev / unregister_netdev don't deal with the .owner stuff, so
your bug isn't there.  If your NIC is a PCI card, it should register it's
driver through pci_register_driver which would deal with the necessary
reference counting.  If it's implemented as a platform device you're
presumably calling driver_register() before platform_device_register() and
driver_register() would do the necessary magic for you.  If you're using a
different bus it may have it's own variant of driver_register which you
should call.  If you don't, you have a problem :-)
