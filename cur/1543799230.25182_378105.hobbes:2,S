Just had a quick look at everything that contains "SATA" or ICH in the
patch list from RedHat, and there are two :
 - one concerns pci_quirks and pci_irqs,
 - one concerns ata_piix.c and libata.c
If the first one seems quite OK, the second one implies going back to
libata 0.93 and switching to the "old" ata_piix.c, as the one in the
2.4.32 kernel contains :
	if (combined) {
		...
		return ENODEV;
	}
thus clearly preventing devices from being detected when combined
more is there.
Do you really think such a big step back is required ?
Regards,
Paul
