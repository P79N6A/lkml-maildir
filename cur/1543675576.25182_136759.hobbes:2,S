I think the main reason (aside from memory consumption) 2.4 has such
small queues is to minimize read latency. If your patch goes off fixes
that, you can probably get away with larger queues, which will help in
merging. But then you definitely want to look into always merging reads,
like Andrew does.
A maximum of ~1000 request entries seems nice if you really give a boost
to reads otherwise.
