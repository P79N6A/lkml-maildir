Linus,
Please do another pull from the 'merge' branch of
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/paulus/powerpc.git merge
Sorry for a second request so soon after the previous one, but I
realized that I had missed one commit that I intended to include, and
without it our 32-bit SMP configs won't compile.
Thanks,
Paul.
