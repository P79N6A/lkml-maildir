SATA ATAPI looks and works just like PATA ATAPI, with one notable 
exception:  S/ATAPI will include "asynchronous notification", a feature 
that allows you to eliminate the polling of the cdrom driver that 
normally occurs.
You can use ATAPI on SATA today, using a PATA->SATA bridge.  In fact 
that's the only way I can test SATA ATAPI at all, right now.
I hope somebody sends me one of these Plextor devices for testing ;-)
