Bernhard,
As Eric mentioned, CONFIG_CRASH_DUMP has been used for all dump capturing
infrastructure and rest of the kexec and kexec on panic functionality
has been put under CONFIG_KEXEC. 
Keeping memory reservation under CONFIG_KEXEC helps in a sense when
somebody is not using a relocatable kernel and uses a custom kernel for dump
capture. In that case he does not have to enable CONFIG_CRASH_DUMP in the
first kernel.
Thanks
Vivek
