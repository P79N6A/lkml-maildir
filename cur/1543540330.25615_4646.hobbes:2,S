I called it a "horror". It is easy to fling shit, but much harder to
write code that tolerates a kernel with non-standard HZ. There are
real live users running with HZ set to 1000 and higher. Now people are
starting to pick multiples of MIDI frequencies.

BSD has plenty to vomit about:
ps t?        Cool, a shell wildcard means "no tty"
ps u12345    Some BSD won't accept a space, so users expect this
ps h         One header per page, conflicting with the old Linux ps
ps axg       If SunOS 4 is BSD to you, 'g' is used, else not
ps u42       The "user" display format, for process 42
ps t         Processes on the current tty
ps t42       Processes on tty 42, NOT anything related to process 42
ps tu42      This horror is supposed to be tty 42 also, not PID 42
Going the BSD way, you are supposed to read kernel memory as root.
Have fun. I eagerly await your code for non-standard HZ support.
