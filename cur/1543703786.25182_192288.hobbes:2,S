The patch did not apply cleanly because it is against a newer
core/memalloc.c than the one in 2.6.1-mm4 (rev 1.19 vs. 1.20).
I fetched memalloc.c rev1.20 from ALSA CVS and applied the
patch on top of that: My es1968 soundcard works.
(To make sure the whole problem was not just caused by an
out-of-date memalloc.c in 2.6.1-mm4 I also tried just
the updated memalloc.c without your patch, but this did
not cure the "DMA buffer beyond 256MB" problem.)
