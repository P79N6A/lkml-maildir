Hi!
I can see a lot of "MTRR 1 not used" messages when the X server ends or
is restarted while running 2.5.69-mmx.
# cat /proc/mtrr
reg00: base=0x00000000 (   0MB), size= 256MB: write-back, count=1
reg01: base=0xfd000000 (4048MB), size=   8MB: write-combining, count=1
I have an ATI RAGE Mobility M1 AGP with 8MB video card. I have never
seen this message on 2.4 kernels. What does this mean?
