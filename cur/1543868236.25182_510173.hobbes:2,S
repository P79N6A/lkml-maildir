The host driver is supposed to call mmc_resume_host from it's resume
callback.  This should be called before the child's resume callback.

I don't see that - as I say above, the correct sequence is:
 - host device resume
     - calls mmc_resume_host()
 - child's device resume (mmc_blk_resume)
     - mmc_queue_resume()
