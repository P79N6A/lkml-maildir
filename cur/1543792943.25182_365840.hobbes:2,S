yes. traces show that the new calibration code results in a bogomips 
value on Athlon64 CPUs that halve the timeout. I.e. udelay(100) now 
takes 50 usecs (!). The calibration code seems to assume the number of 
cycles == number of loops in __delay() - that is not valid. The 
calibration needs to happen based on some real clock, such as the PIT, 
or PIT-driven jiffies.
