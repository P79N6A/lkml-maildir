As far as I understand the kernel generates random numbers gathering
data from several entropy sources, you will never get repetability
from there. Two options I know of:
1) The standard C library has the functions rand and random, wich
seems to have a decent distribution of the random numbers.
2) If you use C++, the Boost library (www.boost.org) has an excelent
set of options for generating random numbers.

That is not dead which can eternal lie,
and with strange aeons, even death may die.
