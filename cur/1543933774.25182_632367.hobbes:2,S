The current solution is as follow:
1. The original kernel will set %edi to jump back entry if resumable and
set %edi to 0 if not.
2. The purgatory of loaded kernel will check %edi, if it is not zero,
the string "jump_back_entry=<jump_back_entry>" will be appended to
kernel command line parameter.
3. In kexeced kernel, if there is "jump_back_entry=<jump_back_entry>"
in /proc/cmdline, the previous kernel is resumable, otherwise not.
As for ELF NOTE, in fact, the ELF NOTE does not work for resumable
kernel. Because the contents of source page and destination page is
swapped during kexec, and the kernel access the destination page
directly during parsing ELF NOTE. All memory that is swapped need to be
accessed via the backup pages map (image->head). I think these
information can be exchanged between two kernels via kernel command line
or /proc/kimgcore.

Yes, this is better. I will change it.

Yes. I think so too. The current implementation of krestore restoring
the hibernated image using /dev/oldmem. And the hibernated image can be
launched using --load-jump-back-helper.

The image of B is made as you said. And it can be restored as follow:
/sbin/kexec -l --args-none --flags=0x2 <kimgecore>
/sbin/kexec -e
That is, the image of B is loaded as a ordinary ELF file. A option
to /sbin/kexec named --flags are added to specify the
KEXEC_PRESERVE_CONTEXT flags for sys_kexec_load. This has been tested.

Yes. This is better. I will change it.

An example:
1. kernel A kexec kernel B, provides vmcoreinfo in kernel command line.
2. kernel B jump back to kernel A
3. in kernel A, the memory image of kernel B is saved via /proc/kimgcore
4. system reboot, kernel C is booted
5. kernel C load the memory image of kernel B, and jump back to kernel B
In step 5, the vmcoreinfo provided in step 1 is invalid, so a
communication method is needed to tell kernel B the new one. This can be
done via amending /proc/kimgcore. For example, change the memory of the
kernel command line of kernel B.
