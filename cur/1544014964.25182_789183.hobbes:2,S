Thanks this is all good.

Actually I was thinking of something as simple as just using
cryptd as is.  That is, register a blkcipher algorithm for your
version of cbc-aes, but don't register under the name cbc(aes),
e.g., register it under the name of __cbc-aes-aesni for both alg
name and driver name.  You can register it under cbc(aes) too
if you add the fallback in there.
Then for the real thing, just allocate the blkcipher __cbc_*,
plus the ablkcipher cryptd(__cbc_*), and invoke the right one
depending on caller context.
This is even simpler for the modes which you don't implement.
In that case you would just allocate FOO(aes-aesni) in conjunction
with cryptd(FOO(aes-aesni)).
Cheers,
