There are all kinds of policy decisions about how many of something is 
in the kernel...  For example, file descriptors, selectable file 
descriptors, etc.
It would be simple to determine how many events should be saved by even 
the most complex application or event counts could be configurable.  The 
issue of dropping events only matters for startup, since anything later 
is likely not to have as many new devices as a startup sequence might...

Binary is fine by me.  Ascii *also* has to be kept in sync, even if its 
more readable, its just as much an interface as binary.

still a new process is spawned per event which is what we should want to 
avoid.
