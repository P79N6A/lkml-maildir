> Hi, 
> 
> I wish to ask for your assistance.  I have a PixelView TV card that I have
> installed on my dual booted linux 2.2.1 (redhat 5.0) and win98.  The card
> works under Win98.  Under Linux I can see channels 61,62,63,64, & 78.  I
> can not see any other channels.  The other channels all show up as either
> totally blue or a totally "snowy" picture.  Audio works only only on
> 61,62,etc.  I have looked at the card and it uses the bt848akfp chip.  It
> has a philips tuner on it, but I can not tell exactly which kind.  Below I
> have the listing from some of the test runs I have done with the bttv
> drivers (I am using 0.6.2) and xawtv.  I am presently not using any
> mapping, although I have tried to do that (with no better results) .  The
> video card is a Diablo3D by a company named mirage.  It runs a S3 Savage3D
> video chipset.  Because this card doesn't have direct XFree support (no
> driver) I am using the Framebuffer device to run X.  The vesafb message
> during boot up shows vidmem = 0xd80 and that it's being remapped to 0xe68.
> Trying these settings didn't change anything (so I removed them).  I don't
> know if the framebuffer device support DGA (honestly I don't really know
> what that is).   Also note that it is recognized as a MIRO card.  Upon
> closer inspection of the PixelView card it looks like it has the same
> setup as the MIRO card.  
> 
> The first test is using tuner=1 setting
