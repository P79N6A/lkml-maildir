Yes there was some merging trouble with this and some of the hunks 
applied to the wrong places and I didn't remove the wrong one 
in the first fixup patch. Sorry. This should fix it up.
Andrew, can you send that one to Linus please?

Remove wrong cpu_has_apic checks that came from mismerging.
We only need to check cpu_has_apic in the IO-APIC/L-APIC parsing,
not for all of ACPI.
