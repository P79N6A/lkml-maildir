Dear Rogier,
have a look at Stevens' APUE, the page that describes lseek(2) (it is not
at hand and I can't remember page number) it will tell you which
particular flavour (AT&T SVR3 or something similar) did that. I definitely
(but vaguely, 5-6 years ago or so) remember situations where negative
offsets off /dev/kmem were valid and useful.
Regards,
Tigran.
