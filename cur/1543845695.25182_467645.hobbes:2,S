There's no locking.  This is a direct copy of the original powerpc 
code.  I assume, but haven't checked, that there's a lock to serialize 
module loading/unloading, so the insertion/deletion is all properly 
synchronized. 
The only other user is traversal when actually handling a bug; if you're 
very unlucky this could happen while you're actually loading/unloading 
and you would see the list in an inconsistent state.  I guess we could 
put a lock there, and trylock it on traversal; at least that would stop 
a concurrent modload/unload from getting in there while we're trying to 
walk the list.

I'll get right on that.  And perhaps it should be signed if people 
overshoot and introduce a negative number of BUGs.
