Similar thread came across l-k not long ago.  Start reading at
http://www.kernelnotes.org/lnxlists/linux-kernel/lk_9911_02/msg01137.html
and see Andi Kleen's hacks for the kernel and for ssh at
http://www.kernelnotes.org/lnxlists/linux-kernel/lk_9911_02/msg01235.html
The idea is to allow a manual "kickstart" to a TCP connection, and to
bind this to an SSH key sequence.  (*Automated* quick link recovery in
problematic without messing up congestion avoidance.  *Manual* recovery
is conceptually similar to hitting "STOP" then "RELOAD" in Netscape,
i.e. it sometimes works wonders and you can't stop people from trying
it, one way or another, anyway.)
I didn't try the patches but they look good on (virtual) paper.
