First to be honest swiotlb performance is not very high on the priority list. 
It will always be bad. If you care about performance you should use devices 
that can address all your memory.
EM64T server boxes shouldn't have big problems with that because they usually
support AHCI for IDE, and firewire/usb2/sound is not that critical. And the 
EM64T boxes with other chipsets typically don't support >4G phys because they 
only support the lowerend Intel CPUs. Summit might be an exception, but those
normally only use IDE for CDROMs, which are also not a big issue.

Not in this form no. Problem first needs to be understood fully and
then no_iommu should be set properly.

That is ugly and I don't like it.  Need to track down the real problem
