Sadly, gcc doesn't do it in this case. Still, I'd rather keep the source 
clean, and hope that the compiler improves eventually, than to make the 
code uglier.
I replaced both of the "test_bit(WORK_STRUCT_PENDING, &work->management)" 
with "work_pending(work)" in my tree.
Now somebody who knows how to trigger this thing should just _test_ it.
