For the benefit of those who want to run 2.4.0-test12 and
2.4.0-test13-preX kernels with ReiserFS and who are not actively
monitoring the reiserfs-list, the following information may be
of interest.
Reiserfs version 3.6.22 (only) now works with these latest kernels, but
two additional patches for 2.4.0-test12 and a third patch for test13-preX are 
necessary.
Reiserfs-3.6.22 is available at:
ftp://ftp.namesys.com/pub/2.4/linux-2.4.0-test10-reiserfs-3.6.22-patch.gz
The first two additional patches are available here:
ftp://ftp.reiserfs.org/pub/2.4/beta/reiserfs-test12-patches.tar.gz
This tar contains:
readpage-uptodate.diff    Linus's version (Test12 ll_rw_block thread)
reiserfs-3622-test12.diff
For 2.4.0-test13-pre1,2,3, the following Makefile patch is needed:
ftp://ftp.reiserfs.org/pub/2.4/beta/test13-preX/reiserfs-Makefile-patch
If you apply these patches in this order, you shouldn't get any rejects.
(Apply the test13-preX patch first).
Have fun,
Steven
