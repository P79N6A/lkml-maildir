It'd take some kernel archaeology to work out how things got the way they
are.
Perhaps the issue with VT_LOCKSWITCH is that its effects will persist after
the user has logged out?  So user A is effectively altering user B's
console, hence suitable capabilities are needed?
Is the current code actually causing any observable problem?
