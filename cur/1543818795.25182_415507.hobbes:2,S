Ok, sometimes I feel special, but never that "special" :)  If you note,
USB also does this for its core files, so there is precidence...
Anyway, is include/linux/pci/pci.h really necessary for just one file?
I guess I could put the msi stuff in there, but again, I really don't
want any driver including it, like they have tried to do so in the
past...
