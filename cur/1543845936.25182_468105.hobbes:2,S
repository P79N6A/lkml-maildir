Well, I tried to hack the patch into 2.6.18 driver, but wasn't very 
successful. It migt be also due to the case that I have a MCP51 chipset and 
if I read the patch correctly it isn't designed  to activate ADMA on MCP51. 
Do you know whether MCP51 knows ADMA? If not, how is NCQ to be activated on 
MCP51? According to nvidia.com and windows user reports MCP51 does know NCQ.
Cheers,
