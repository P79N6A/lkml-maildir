  Umm, yes. You're right, my previous explanation was bogus. But that
should do no harm as we do not touch the journal_head of the buffer in
wbuf array. We just eventually send it to disk. We are guarded against
truncate/memory pressure because we hold the buffer lock so that should
be fine too.

  Actually not quite - I've been thinking about the other problems for
quite some while and I did not find a way to fix other flaws in a
non-intrusive way. I also like small and clean fixes but sometimes one
has to simply rewrite the code...
