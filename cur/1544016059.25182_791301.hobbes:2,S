Dear bugzilla admin,
Could you please unlock bugzilla so that everybody (starting with me)
is allowed to change the attachment types? I am a bit tired of having
to e-mail the person who created the attachment to ask him/her to
change the type from application/octet-stream to text/plain so that I
can see the attachment directly in my web browser. If we want people to
help with bugs, we must make it as easy for them as possible.
Thanks,
