ok.. my intention was not to change callers for removing attribute group and 
keep the changes within sysfs. But if you prefer otherway (I too :-)), please 
see the patch below. As of now I can see only netdev not releasing attribute 
group. I guess power subsystem don't need to remove attribute groups created 
in pm_init() and pm_disk_init() as these don't unregister from sysfs.
Thanks

o attribute group should be removed while unregistering from sysfs. netdev
  does not do this and leaks dentries belonging to the attribute group. 
  The following patch removes the attribute group when netdev is unregistered.
