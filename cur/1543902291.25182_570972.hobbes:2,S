Turns out the boot failure wasn't related to the merge after all.  With
my orginal compile (and the revert below) PCI works and the kernel
boots.
Please apply both.

Subject: [PATCH] Revert "[POWERPC] Do firmware feature fixups after features are initialised"
This reverts commit 5a26f6bbb767d7ad23311a1e81cfdd2bebefb855.
The original patch causes boot failures when built with ppc64_defconfig.  The
quickest fix is to revert it while alterates are investigated.
