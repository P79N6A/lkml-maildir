Actually if this is a patch against 2.6, between ramfs (including initramfs) 
and the ability to loopback mount files, I personally consider ramdisks 
semi-obsolete.  (This might be _why_ it says most normal users won't need 
them.)

Again, on 2.6, most users will probably answer N and will instead use 
initramfs.
