   The hidden assumption of the pre-emption patch  is that there are kernel 
   paths that take more than 500us to reach a schedule or return to user 
   mode. Obviously there are such paths, but what are they and why can't they
   be fixed?
Just to name a few obvious ones:
1) write(fd, buffer, SOME_LARGE_VALUE);
2) read(fd, buffer, SOME_LARGE_VALUE);
I honestly can't think of a way in which we'd want to deal with these
cases, except to perhaps check need_resched after or before copying
each page into/out-of the page cache out-of/into user space.  And I
believe this is what the pre-emption patch and Ingo's low-latency
variant is up to basically.
