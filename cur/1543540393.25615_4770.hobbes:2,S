It's kinda hard to work around a bug in the Bridge. There just isn't
all that much to program. You just write 0x07 to the command register to
turn it on. Whatever bits stick are the ones supported by the device.
The Device ID and Vendor ID are always visible, even if the chip isn't
enabled. It either works or it doesn't. So as I said, it's unlikely that
they would market a bad chip.
PCI Interface Chips that support complex devices like a 'Mass storage
controller' can be filthy with bugs, however the bridge chip itself
either works or it doesn't.
