Per defintion you need to include <asm/irq.h> right now.  I'd like to change
that to <linux/interrupt.h>, but not my including <asm/irq.h> there.
We should just make the prototypes in <linux/interrupt.h> unconditional
and get rid of the macro/inline tricks some architectures do, these calls
aren't exactly fastpathes where that matters.
