Does anyone know if this chip, which goes by PCI ID 8086:27c4 (as  
listed in ata_piix.c) is something that ahci.c can also drive? It  
isn't listed explicity in ahci.c file, but ata_piix.c file says it's  
identical to ICH6M, which is listed in ahci.c.
PS. I'm not subscribed to the list, so please CC me on the answer.
TIA,
