Hmm. I can't find any docs on the registers it was twiddling, but from a
hexdump of the .COM file Cyrix give as their work around, it looks like the
2.3.6-2.3.10 code was doing the same thing.

In which case can it at least still shout about the bug when it finds it?
People who were used to the 2.2 behaviour will get a bit of shock when 2.4
materialises.
Also, does this mean the distributions (e.g. Redhat? :) are going to detect
the CPU type on start-up and run set6x86 appropriately? No, I didn't think
so..
BTW Alan - ORBS has got one of the Demon relays again, so I can't mail you
direct. I'm off to bang some heads together at Demon towers, if I can.
