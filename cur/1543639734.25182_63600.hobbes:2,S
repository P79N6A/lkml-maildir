Sorry, I don't understand what you're getting at.  Currently the behaviour is
consistent between config, menuconfig and xconfig: null-valued deps are ignored.

Ah.  If you're willing to knowingly feed Linus with patches that break current
config behaviour, then OK we have a way to proceed.

Sorry, didn't see that.

Absolutely, and I have a catalogue of dust puppies to help that process ;-)

CML2's semantics were that all symbols have a default which is a zero; for
booleans and tristates that means "n".  Changing from those semantics to the
ones necessary to run the gcml2 rulebase on CML1 rules was one of the most
painful parts of supporting CML1.
So I think having an explicit "n" default is a good idea, but I fail to see how
you would actually implement such a thing in a shell based parser.

This is precisely the CML2 semantics.

Agreed.

I don't think there's any value to gratuitously breaking 2.4's config.
That's the point of a "stable" series right?

Ah, glad you asked, see attached output from the latest version of gcml2
(not yet released).
