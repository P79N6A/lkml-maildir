btw, regardless of what glibc is doing, still the cpu shouldn't go
idle IMHO. Even if we're overscheduling and trashing over the mmap_sem
with threads (no idea if other OS schedules the task away when they
find the other cpu in the mmap critical section), or if we've
overscheduling with futex locking, the cpu usage should remain 100%
system time in the worst case. The only explanation for going idle
legitimately could be on HT cpus where HT may hurt more than help but
on real multicore it shouldn't happen.
