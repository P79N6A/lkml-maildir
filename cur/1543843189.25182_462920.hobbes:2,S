Hi,
	I have one question about CLOCK_REALTIME_HR. 
Before the rt patch I used to work with this clock. ie : hrtimers-support-3.1.1
With the rt patch it seems CLOCK_REALTIME_HR does not exist anymore !
Is this normal ?
The kernel speaks about that in arch/ia64/Kconfig
perhaps it should be removed !
I had a libtimers using this clock.
Is the good correction to say CLOCK_REALTIME_HR = CLOCK_REALTIME ?
I don't want to modify all my programs.
