 Ask them.

 It could be either.  For example some IBM hardware used to be known to 
have problems, like the 8254 timer freezing occasionally, when the APIC 
was used and the NMI watchdog enabled.  On some laptops you would get an 
instant hard lockup if you enabled the APIC and used one of the special 
key combinations (whether on purpose or by chance) used to adjust display 
brightness, etc..

 It depends on what you want to use NMIs for.  For their PC/AT compatible 
purpose, that is reporting of memory parity/ECC and bus errors, it works 
in either mode.  For any other purpose you need an APIC.
