Okay, here's more info.  Earlier I reported my HPT366 kernel locking up
before uncompressing.  I rebuilt with SMP and it at least tries to load.
Now, I get a kernel panic 'cause my root fs isn't mounted.  Here's what
the hand-copied screen looks like:
   Uniform Multi-Platform E-IDE driver Revision: 6.30
   CMD640: ignored by ide_scan_pci_device() (uses own driver)
   HPT366: onboard version of chipset, pin1=1 pin2=1
   HPT366: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 78
   HPT366: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
       ide0: BM-DMA  at 0xf800-0xf807, BIOS settings: hda:pio, hdb=pio
   HPT366: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 79
   HPT366: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
       ide0: BM-DMA  at 0xf400-0xf407, BIOS settings: hdc:pio, hdd=pio
   ide0: buggy cmd640b interface on PCI (type2), config=0x7e
   ide1: not serialized, secondary interface not cmd640
   cmd640: drive0 timings/prefetch(off) preserved
   cmd640: drive1 timings/prefetch(off) preserved
   Floppy drive(s): fd0 is 1.44M
   FDC 0 is a post-1991 82077
   scsi : 0 hosts
   scsi : detected total.
   request_module[block-major-3]: Root fs not mounted
   VFS: Cannot open root device 03:02
   Kerenl panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on 03:02
For comparison, a normal (sans HPT366) boot looks like this:
   CMD640: ignored by ide_scan_pci_device() (uses own driver)
   ide0: buggy cmd640b interface on PCI (type2), config=0x7e
   ide1: not serialized, secondary interface not cmd640
   cmd640: drive0 timings/prefetch(off) preserved, clocks=2/3/3
   cmd640: drive1 timings/prefetch(off) preserved, clocks=2/3/3
   hda: ST3630A, ATA DISK drive
   hdb: WDC AC22100H, ATA DISK drive
   hdc: FX820S, ATAPI CDROM drive
   hdd: NEC CD-ROM DRIVE:252, ATAPI CDROM drive
   ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6 on irq 14
   ide1 at 0x170-0x177,0x376 on irq 15
   hda: ST3630A, 601MB w/120kB Cache, CHS=1223/16/63
   hdb: WDC AC22100H, 2014MB w/128kB Cache, CHS=4092/16/63
   hdc: ATAPI 8X CD-ROM drive, 256kB Cache
   Uniform CDROM driver Revision: 2.56
   hdd: ATAPI 6X CD-ROM changer w/4 slots, 128kB Cache
   Floppy drive(s): fd0 is 1.44M
   FDC 0 is a post-1991 82077
   ...
So you see, here it detects drives, whereas with the HPT366 compiled in
it does not...
What I want is:
   ide0: CMD640
      hda: ST3630A, 601MB w/120kB Cache, CHS=1223/16/63
      hdb: WDC AC22100H, 2014MB w/128kB Cache, CHS=4092/16/63
   ide1: "unserialized, non-cmd640 secondary interface" (it's onboard ISA IDE)
      hdc: ATAPI 8X CD-ROM drive, 256kB Cache
      hdd: ATAPI 6X CD-ROM changer w/4 slots, 128kB Cache
   ide2: BM-DMA  at 0xf800-0xf807, BIOS settings: hda:pio, hdb=pio
      hde: whatever I attach here
      hdf: whatever I attach here
   ide3: BM-DMA  at 0xf400-0xf407, BIOS settings: hdc:pio, hdd=pio
      hdg: whatever I attach here
      hdh: whatever I attach here
Can this be done?  
Also, what's the meaning of 
   HPT366: onboard version of chipset, pin1=1 pin2=1
This is a PCI card in slot 1.
Finally, is the meaning of
   request_module[block-major-3]: Root fs not mounted
I didn't compile "ide-probe" as a module--what's it complaining about?
Hopefully this is enough information for you guys to give me a hand.
Thanks,
Brendan
