Hi,
 got this in my /var/log/messages after trying to
 access my scanner (scsi generic, used newest sg-code
 by Douglas Gilbert):
 Mar 24 20:18:42 solfire sudo: mccramer : TTY=pts/0 ; PWD=/proc/scsi ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/home/mccramer/bin/find-scanner
 Mar 24 20:18:53 solfire kernel: Unlink of SHM id 5472271 failed (-1). 
 Mar 24 20:19:06 solfire kernel: Unlink of SHM id 5570576 failed (-1). 
 Mar 24 20:19:18 solfire kernel: Unlink of SHM id 5668881 failed (-1). 
 Access to scanner first locks the machine (SYSREQ boot still works, sync
 and unmount don't), then after reboot the command 'find-scanner' (distributed 
 with sane-1.02) still finds the scanner on /dev/sg1 but access via
 xsane/xscanimage reports "no device available" along with the messages above.
 If further help/reports/logs etc neccessary, pleas email me!
 KEEP HACKING!
 Meino
