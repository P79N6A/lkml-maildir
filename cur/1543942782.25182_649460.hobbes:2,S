Seems that it should be a stream of eight
CPU n is now offline
CPU n down

I reworked that on top of ed50d6cbc394cd0966469d3e249353c9dd1d38b9: no
change.
However I watched the vga console this time (nothing is coming over
netconsole at this stage) I saw this:
CPU 1 is now offline
<10 second pause>
CPU 1 is down
CPU 2 is now offline
CPU 2 is down
CPU 3 is now offline
CPU 3 is down
CPU 4 is now offline
<10 second pause>
followed by a quick spew of the remaining CPUs going down and offline then
poweroff.
