I have updated this driver with a version 3 of the patch, taking into
account all of these comments.
See resolutions below.  The updated patch will follow shortly.

Of course!  I will drop the &.  Also, because this variable is only
used once, I'll drop the
variable entirely.

That would make sense, but there is nothing in the spec that states
that.  The bit does need
to be set, so I'll leave this in.

I have updated the driver to add in the proper handling of the various
PIO modes,
in a similar manner to what the PIIX driver does.

Code removed.

Updated accordingly.

I'll indicate PIO mode 0 is not supported.

Dropped!

IT8172G has these bits implemented differently, hence the limitation shouldn't apply. You shouldn't just update the masks without doing anythiung about programming the modes...
Mode programming added, and mask now set to ATA_MWDMA2

I've changed it to "Steve Longerbeam", and I removed the obsolete email address.
