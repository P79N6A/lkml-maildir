That's the only thing I know of that used it.
I'd really like to know if there are any real workloads that
benefited from this feature, rather than just some benchmark.
I can do some research, but was hoping someone on this list
might remember.  If there is a valid workload, I'll propose
a patch.  However, I don't think we should be adding patches/
features just to help some benchmark that is unrelated to
real world use.
