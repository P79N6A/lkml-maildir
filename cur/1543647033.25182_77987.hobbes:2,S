Users might just fill up all xattr space leaving no space for ACLs (or 
similar). If user xattrs are disabled this can no longer occur, so some 
administrators might be happy to have a choice.

With the registration API modules doing HSM/LSM/... can just register handlers 
without having to modify the file system code. Otherwise we would have to 
hand code additional hooks for independently loadable modules.
