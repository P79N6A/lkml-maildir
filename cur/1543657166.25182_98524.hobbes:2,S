Ermm no.
Lets correct a few comments made here
1.  On Pentium II/III we have no known cases where MCE is misreported.
(Some old pentiums dont have the external bits of the MCA/MCE stuff
wired up  right so do trigger it). Radeon IGP also triggers it but for
what appear to be valid reasons (Linux confused the chipset badly)
2.  The panic occurs because the CPU set flags saying that the CPU state
was corrupt. That is it trapped out at a point where the previous state
could not be recovered, so the trap is fatal
3.  Don't be suprised if it moves CPU. It is possible (and not uncommon)
to set up dual systems so that both CPU's boot and race to become CPU#0.
This is actually recommended since the box will then almost always boot
with one failed CPU.
Running each CPU as a single CPU test may find a faulty CPU.
