This is the first time in a long time I'm experiencing problems with
the Linux kernel. A wonderful job. The backside is that it's also a
very long time ago since the last time I read (parts of) the kernel.
One of my users complained of netscape hanging frequently while
reading news. I tried to find out what was happening and found
netscape in the ``uninterruptible sleep' state. When checking dmesg I
found this message:

Well, if the kernel says it's a bug, it'll be a bug, right? But I
really don't know what to do with this. I checked out that line and
got the message that this is something for 2.5. The kernel is
2.4.0pre8 using APIC on a mono CPU, compiled with gcc 2.95.2,
debian/woody box (Athlon CPU, Biostar motherboard, VIA chipset).
I wonder if there is anything I can do in this situation beside
switching off APIC and waiting for 2.5.0. The bad thing is, that after
this has happened, sync, shutdown (and some other programs?) also fall
asleep, forcing me to powercycle the computer. I can't really tell how
to reproduce the problem, but as it is popping up quite frequently, a
more knowledable writer on this list might be able to tell me how to
prepare such an event to make it reproducible. In both cases, please
CC to me, as I'm not on this list.
TIA
Christoph
