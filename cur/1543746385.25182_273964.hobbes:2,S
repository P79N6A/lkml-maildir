I'll even add that the default behavior slows the system down with extra
scheduling switches.  If IRQ 10 is preempted by IRQ 2 then there's an
extra switch to get back and finish IRQ 10. For every IRQ that comes
during a "lower" priority IRQ there's an extra switch needed. If the
IRQs really don't have a order of priority, then they should be the
same. Some cases you need to set IRQs at different priorities, but that
should be done by the user and not the kernel giving the first irq
preference.
