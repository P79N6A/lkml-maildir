Hi,
I'm looking for a patch to the redhat 2.4 kernel to add Unicode
support to smbfs. My particular version is 2.4.26. I searched the list
archives and found someone named Urban Widmark claimed to have a patch
for 2.4.18, but his URL is outdated.
If anyone has this patch, please let me know -- this would help me
greatly. Thanks!
