Well, we had some advance :-)
I have really no clue about what can cause your system getting no interrupt 
free for pcmcia. 
>>airo: register interrupt 0 failed, rc -16
Googling for "pcmcia-cs register interrupt 0 failed" i found this:
http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/archive/3/2003/07/4/48965
 where it 
points to a ISA related issue.

If it does not help you, i  can only point you to the pcmcia-cs documentation 
about interrupts at
 
http://pcmcia-cs.sourceforge.net/ftp/doc/PCMCIA-HOWTO-5.html#ss5.2
hope it helps. ( tell us please :-)  )
