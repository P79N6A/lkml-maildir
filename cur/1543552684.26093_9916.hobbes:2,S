I disagree violently with doing this in the low-level drivers.
If it cannot be done in user space (which is dubious in itself, but I'll
certainly accept it), then why not just do the equivalent of a reset in
the high-level IDE driver on coming back from sleep? Possibly together
with forcing any other setup state we know about.
That, together with using the pci_register_driver() thing, would be my
preferred approach by far. This kind of low-level twiddling and special
casing _will_ come back to haunt us later.
