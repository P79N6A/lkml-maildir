Subject: [PATCH] Fix 8139too ring size for dreamcast/embedded
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Presently 2.6.6 backs out the CONFIG_8139_RXBUF_IDX in favor of using a
hardcoded 8139_RXBUF_IDX (again). This seems to have been done due to
some issues occuring with 8139_RXBUF_IDX == 3, however (as the Kconfig
pointed out), we still need 8139_RXBUF_IDX == 1 in the CONFIG_SH_DREAMCAST
case.
The patch which made this change can be seen at:

!-|index.html|stats|!+|index.html|ChangeSet@-8w
Before that, CONFIG_8139_RXBUF_IDX was set to 1 both in the CONFIG_SH_DREAMCAST
and CONFIG_EMBEDDED cases. This patch adds that back into the current 8139too.
Additionally, why remove the config option at all? Wouldn't it just be
easier to drop the range from 0 - 3 to 0 - 2 until problems with a 64K ring
size are resolved?
