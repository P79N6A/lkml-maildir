That's the way for the user or admin to do it.  It would be good
for a driver to be able to say "I like my interrupt here, please
don't move it".   It can be advisory, rather than mandatory, but
there are often cases where one driver is hurt by something that
is generally beneficial, and disabling it everywhere is a big
hammer.
It works, but it's not ideal.   Different issue than you are
dealing with, but I thought it was worth bringing up, as long
as we are talking about moving interrupts.
