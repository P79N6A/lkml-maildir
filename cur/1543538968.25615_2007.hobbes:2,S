Subject: Why do these messages happen and 2.4.0-t4p6 eats all memory for itself.

I see these messages frequently throughout the day on this machine as
well as others.  Why do they happen?
Both hosts mentioned here are using 2.4.0-test4-pre6.  mail.kali is a
machine in my bedroom presently and the cable modem is using a mix of
iptables NAT and GRE tunneling for addressing.  The NAT 1:many is only
for ports 80, 993, and ftp.

I've seen these messages for over a year on different kernels.  Until
now I've mostly ignored them.  However mail.kali is now spontaneously
rebooting several times a day.  Just before rebooting, all memory is
consumed, most of it appears in the buffers.  -But-, a ps aux doesn't
reflect the usage nor does anything appear to be abnormal.  VM killing
messages appear just before it reboots.
I'm now running a watch on free and vmstat, if someone wants more stats,
please let me know what program to run to collect them.
Thanks
