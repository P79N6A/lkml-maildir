I'm still undecided about whether to fill with idle frames or not.
Alan's convinced me that we can try without, and if it causes real
problems on real connections, add it later.  It might be fine.
Echo cancelling means the Tx side needs to know when an underrun occurs,
and precisely how many sample points were transmitted in the underrun.
Because, as you point out, it needs to know the exact signal that's
transmitted.

During the training period, modem latency is not important so we can use
a larger output buffer and underruns won't happen.

Assume we know exactly what's transmitted, even during an underrun.
Does the echo canceller adapt so quickly that the change in signal
character will screw it up?
If so, then would having the kernel driver fill with a
zero-autocorrelation pattern fix that?

That's the one to look at after all the others have failed.

You seem to know a lot about echo cancellation.  Can you point me to
good, freely available references on the subject?  I have a design, but
it's based on hand-waving and dodgy maths...
What sort of phase effects are present in sound card converters?
