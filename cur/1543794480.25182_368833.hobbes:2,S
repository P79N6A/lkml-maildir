This is actually the 'as' request state detection being a little to
anxious, I think. The cdrom layer reuses the same request several times
instead of allocating/freeing it inside the loop, and 'as' barfs if the
request state isn't 'fresh' when it first sees the request after it has
completed once.
This should work around the issue in the cdrom layer, even though it
isn't actually buggy.

It just so happens to trigger there, because then you drop into single
frame dma mode which will iterate the loop several times per request
(which then exposes the bug).

That'll do fine as well, of course.
