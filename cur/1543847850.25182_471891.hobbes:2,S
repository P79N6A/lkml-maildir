That's great news. I accept that it's impractical to port back to 
earlier hardware, but it means it'll stop being a problem eventually.
(Entirely unrelatedly, have you got any idea why several D-series 
Latitudes with Intel graphics switch off the backlight on lid close and 
never switch it back on again? It happens under Windows if you boot in 
safe mode, so it's not Linux specific...)
