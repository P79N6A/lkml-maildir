a) He's already on CC
b) No config I have posted was invalid
c) There are two (possibly three) entirely separate issues
You've got the wrong end of the stick here. I'm not saying V4L isn't required 
for MEDIA_TUNER, but MEDIA_TUNER should not be a dependency of V4L and so 
should NOT be unconditionally enabled.
The first issue is obviously the build error, which can be resolved by adding 
a dep on I2C to MEDIA_TUNER, but given the recent churn there I'll leave that 
to Mauro.
The second issue is the fact that the MEDIA_TUNER option is transparent and 
not user selectable, building code that is probably not required in some 
kernel configurations (tuner code depends on V4L, but surely not the other 
way around.. MEDIA_TUNER should be able to be n when VIDEO_DEV is y).
The final issue is more of a matter of personal taste, which refers to the 
MEDIA_TUNER_CUSTOMIZE option, something that I think should be inverted and 
turned into a menu like most other device driver sections. So rather than 
MEDIA_TUNER_CUSTOMIZE, why not just have MEDIA_TUNER be visible to the user, 
and if Y, let them select tuners, and if N, no tuners are built.
