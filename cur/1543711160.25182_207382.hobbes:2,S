Replying to my own post.
Forget the proposed patch.  If we ever want to get the new interfaces
standardized saying the affinity mask is undefined after a failed
setaffinity call is not acceptable.
So I'm going to hardcode the fact that the value returned by a
successful getaffinity call will never change.  Regardless of how many
hotplug CPUs as added.  Can this be guaranteed?
