There are embedded platforms that are using NUMA memory policies,
including mbind() in applications for setting them. Page migration is a
little iffier, but that can be turned off. Embedded platforms with
multiple memories (and a different cost per memory) are quite common, and
they're getting large enough to offset the overhead of a pgdat + bootmem
map. We have them on nommu also, but that's not been hacked up generically yet.
