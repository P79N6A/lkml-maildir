The correct solution to this problem is "suspend-to-disk" --
if the machine isn't doing anything anyway, TURN IT OFF.
One slightly more practical solution from the "you-now-who gets angry
mails" POV anyway, would be to tie the reduced-rate scanning to the load
average -- if nothing at all happens, swap-out doesn't need to happen
either.
