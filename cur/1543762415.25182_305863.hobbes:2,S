This is incorrect, because it implies that a user would want to use the 
'xstore' feature at full speed -- which would dominate the CPU, 
drastically slowing down the applications that are actually doing work.
As I mentioned in another message, VIA xstore support should be removed 
from hw_random.c and moved completely to userspace rngd.
