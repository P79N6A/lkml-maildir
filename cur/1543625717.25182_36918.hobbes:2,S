Sorry but it is silly. (-; What's wrong with open("filename", O_FLAGS); 
followed by fcntl(); if you want to modify them after opening. That is a 
lot cleaner than going via proc in such a way...
posix_fadvise() can then be implemented in userspace and that can go via 
fcntl(). That way we have the best of both worlds.
Best regards,
Anton
