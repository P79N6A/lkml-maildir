Comments:
1) it seems a bit questionable that the attributes are globally 
writeable, even by unpriveleged heathens?
2) ahci_led_locate_store() and ahci_led_fault()_store are the same, save 
for a single constant
3) Don't document ahci_em_messages values (like SGPIO) which are not 
actually supported in the code.  Feel free to put these in a comment to 
make sure others follow your lead, however
4) ahci_transmit_led_message() is issued completely without any locking. 
   that does not look safe in the face of libata-eh doing a reset?
5) please run through scripts/checkpatch in 2.6.24-rc1, there are 
several "use tabs not spaces" type errors and some other minor style nits
6) ATA_FLAG_EM is added but never used
7) Is it valid to check capabilities bit 6 (EMS) on AHCI 1.0?  I would 
tend to shy away from assuming that all silicon gives us sane 'reserved' 
bits :)
8) when is this actually used?  do you have a sample user in userspace? 
  does a userspace daemon watch disk activity and manage LEDs somehow? 
I'm a bit cloudy on the usage need of this.
9) overall, sans the above comments, the overall goal seems OK to me, 
and the patch seems pretty good.
