    No it isn't.  I've kept pretty much the same set of drivers in my
    standard kernel since 1.2.13 days, and the kernel size went from
    about 400k (1.2.13) to 500k (2.0.28+logo) to 600k (2.2.10) to
    640k (2.3.6)   Some of this is additional driver (VIA IDE support,
    but those drivers came into existance at the same time AMD Lance
    support was modularised, so it's a wash)

    Linux isn't a democracy.  I can discuss until my face turns red,
    but if backwards compatability isn't important to any kernel
    developer (I am not a kernel developer; I just hack the kernel
    so that it works with my projects) it won't make any difference.
    As a general rule, it's a Good Thing that the people who write the
    code get to make the rules, but it's also NOT a Good Thing to assume
    that everyone is a hobbyist who is willing to patch their codebase
    every time a kernel interface is tweaked.
    And speaking of patches, this patch to 2.2.10 puts back the
    old-style fcntl locking:
