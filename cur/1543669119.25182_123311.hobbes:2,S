Well, I think the 'more recently used swapped out' order relation is equivalent
to the 'later swapped out' order relation if the kswapd uses the LRU algorithm.
(if it does not, it has its reasons and we should respect them by simply using
the 'later swapped out' order...)
But I am not familiar with the linux swapping management so I don't know if it
tracks this order in any structure. Perhaps there is a kind of 'last used
timestamp' for each page and so for the swapped pages, too, wich could be used
for my purpose. But as I sayed, I don't know...
I hope there is anybody out there who can help me with this question...
Thanks
