Julian, thanks for sharing the background info.
I assume that strict_interface_arp be enabled only for interfaces
that require it (e.g. for bandwidth control). It does not require loopback
to be hidden. You may have other interfaces (different ip subnets) that
does unrestricted operations.

The arp patches all operate on the case of RTN_LOCAL (address in the box)
- proxy_arp should not be affected.

Agreed. (strict_interface_arp touched arp_solicit and inet_addr_select for
that)
