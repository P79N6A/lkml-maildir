Hi,
    I have an IBM T42 Debian Sid, with latest BIOS and correct options 
(had old BIOS before and still same problem) Sometimes, when I'm running 
on Battery power, I get this problem, it might also occur when charging 
the battery.
I had opened a bug about it in bugzilla, but I never got an answer. I 
provided the acpidump and so on.
This so far with 2.6.13 and 2.6.14 dunno if also with older kernels.
