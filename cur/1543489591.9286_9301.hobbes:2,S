Yep, read it.

Nope, no compilation happening.  As I stated, my system was idle.
I have few system services running, httpd, inetd, sshd, smbd, and
thats about it.  inetd services are all practically disabled.  I
wasn't using any of the network services locally (localhost), and
all of my network connections (eth0, ppp0) were down, as in
ifconfig xxx0 down.  So, the only active programs were PINE,
sitting idle, and the MP3 player.  I tried it several times, and
got similar results each time, I quit PINE and other apps and
even went to single user with nothing running but the MP3 player,
and it still skips.  I have a 200Mhz CPU.  In 2.0.x I can play
MP3's just fine, and have many many apps running and actively
doing stuff.  Only very very occasionally does anything break up
(maybe once or twice in an hour of heavy activity).

My load avg was very low - only the mp3 player was running.  It
is repeatable.  If anyone has suggestions, I can try anything
you like to try and locate the problem.  It certainly isn't X
though, or any other apps.  I'm pretty sure it is kernel related.
