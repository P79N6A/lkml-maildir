0 is valid for ia64, which is the only architecture that currently
defines __HAVE_ARCH_RAW_SPIN_LOCK_FLAGS.  If other architectures want
to define __HAVE_ARCH_RAW_SPIN_LOCK_FLAGS and they need a different
flag value to indicate 'no flags available' then the 0 can be changed
to an arch defined value.  Worry about that if it ever occurs.
