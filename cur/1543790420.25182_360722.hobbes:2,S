Marcel,
The board did take the 4GB of RAM and it is finding them, therefore supports
them. It is just not designed to give a full 4GB of RAM to the system, it only
gives 3.4XGB RAM and the rest is really not used, then basically the system
just tries to give the 0.6xGB RAM remaining a task by it being used by "System
Resources"
This isn't really Linux dependant.
