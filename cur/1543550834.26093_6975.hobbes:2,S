Nobody is suggesting to make any arguments for Linus. That code was just a
trivial "runq history log" thing I needed for finding out why the load on
my machine is always (at least) 1.0 and yet there is no apparent process
to be blamed for it.
What Philipp says is an interesting excercise and I might try it
today. (for my present purposes reducing the size of the log was
sufficient).
