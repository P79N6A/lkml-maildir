PDPTR is documented to have P bits but none of the other control bits, 
unlike other levels of the hierarchy.
The hardware never sets A or D bits on non-present pages, since all the 
bits except P are reserved for the operating systems (and, besides, they 
can never be accessed or dirty.)

Yes.  And as Linus said, it would be a new special case.
