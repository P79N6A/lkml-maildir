Strictly speaking, since ACPI tells us about IRQs, we shouldn't need
probe_irq_on() on ia64, should we?
I don't see any ACPI smarts in the IDE driver, but I think the
serial driver needs only the attached patch to make it avoid
the use of probe_irq_on().  I tested this on i2k and various
HP zx1 boxes, and it works fine.
Russell, if you agree, would you mind applying this?
ACPI and HCDP tell us what IRQ the serial port uses, so there's
no need to have the driver probe for the IRQ.
