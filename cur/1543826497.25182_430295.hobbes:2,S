What is the biggest, or even top 3 or 5?  I've a todo list of some
140-odd entries which are being worked on.  It's slow and tedious,
but in progress.  I'd be happy to hear some top issues (guess we're
talking high-level technical categories here) to help prioritize and
perhaps even augment that todo list.  I've got my ideas and priorities,
but I'm interested to hear yours.
thanks,
