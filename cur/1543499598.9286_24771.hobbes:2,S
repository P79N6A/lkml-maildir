In the driver I'm porting, the mmap function ends with:
   vma->vm_inode = file->f_dentry->d_inode;
   file->f_dentry->d_inode->i_count += 1;
   return 0;
I notice that the above mmap function doesn't mess with inodes 
or i_counts.  Are these still needed in some form in 2.2.x?
Was the driver I'm porting incorrect to begin with?
