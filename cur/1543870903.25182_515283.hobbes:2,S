This would help a similar problem I am having. Simply using a serial console 
with Flow control enabled, turns flow control on. 
If the application wants the capability to turn Flow control on later, without 
booting with it on, the current code does not allow this...
Was this the intended use the the 'console=...r'?
Thanks
