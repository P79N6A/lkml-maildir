I disagree.  Your testing, while I'm sure is long drawn out and massively
complicated, is missing the crucial element of testing what you're
submitting against.  I don't think you need to check the latest bleeding
unstable kernel in your test runs, partly because it changes so fast, and
partly because you'll start to hit bugs that are unrelated to your driver.
But you absolutely must at least test compiling your driver against the
tree you submit it against, and a quick boot of the resulting kernel
wouldn't add much time to your patch submission process.
