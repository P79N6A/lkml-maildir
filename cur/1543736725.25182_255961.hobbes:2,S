Affinity means that a process has an affinity for a particular subset
of the available CPUs within a particular system - it wishes to run
only on these processors. Linux supports hard processor affinity and
process migration to enforce such demands which get be made using the
POSIX sched_[set|get]param calls.
Robert Love has written an excellent book entitled Linux Kernel
Development, it's not expensive and very worthwhile. Chapter 3 is
entitled Scheduling and it explains process affinity as well as
process migration and the concept of migration threads as used within
the Linux kernel to enforce policy in the implmentation.
I suggest also that you consider joining the Kernel Newbies mailing
list, newly revived and now with working signup page over at
