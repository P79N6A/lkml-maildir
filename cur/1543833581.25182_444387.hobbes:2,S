I'd also like to point out that we can do this whole process very
incrementally.  If we want, we can start out with all containers
chroot'd into a filesystem namespace which uses read-only bind mounts
and doesn't allow any write access to the underlying filesystem.
As we introduce the capability checks, we can start to actually
cooperatively share more data.
