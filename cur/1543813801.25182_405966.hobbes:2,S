Actually moving it to the head is good anyway because we may reduce the
amount of padding between vectors.  On i386 however it is size-neutral
with respect to the vectors.  However, it did save 45 bytes on the code
front.
I've applied the patch with the structure rearrangement so that the large
power-of-2 sized members come first.
Thanks,
