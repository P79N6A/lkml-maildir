It would certainly fit nicely with the existing metadata. We already rip out
code comments via kernel-doc, and extending it to rip out
	-	Help text
	-	Web site
	-	Version information
	-	Man page for the driver
	-	Module options
etc, shouldn't be too challenging. Ok so kernel-doc is in perl and ugly perl
but if someone hates it enough to rewrite it in python thats a win too 8)
