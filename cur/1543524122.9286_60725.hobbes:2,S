Fewer instructions doesn't always mean fewer operations.

Many agree.
IMHO the optimal equilibrium point is not static -- best performance
will result from extending the dynamic compilation idea out onto
executables stored on disk, deep into the dynamic translation process
itself (self optimisation), and with software distribution being more of
an interactive conversation than a one-way download.
It's complicated to imagine it running but it may be less complicated to
program than what we do now in our static environments.
have a nice day,
