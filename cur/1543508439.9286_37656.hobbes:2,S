Hmm.....
Are your IDE disks setup in DMA mode?
(do a hdparm /dev/hd<harddisk> eg /dev/hda).
If d == 0, then you'd do good to enable DMA transfer **only** if it's safe
to do so (eg Intel chipset, good h/d, etc).
I get very low processor usage (<4%) maxing out the IDE bus and my harddisk
(I get 20.5MB/s to/from it on a Celeron 464A). Of course, the more seeking
done, the less processor time doing I/O (but less transfer rate). This may
imply that it may not be the I/O subsystem. Other tweaks such as 32-bit
transfer, optimal read-ahead, etc help a significant amount AFAICT. Check
the hdparm man page.
(If you were running windows 9x, lots of I/O will draw **lots** of processor
time)
