Thanks. In the meantime I have gone through the code and I can confirm 
that this is the root cause of what I am observing.
Now regarding the patch - at the time when the dim happened previously, 
currently there is a observable blink (after which the brightness is 
correct). I have put some debugging printk() into fb_notifier_callback(), 
and it turns out that on FB_EVENT_CONBLANK, there are two successive calls 
to backlight_update_status(), second immediately following the first one:
Feb 26 15:11:14 thunder kernel: calling backlight_update_status() with bd->props.fb_blank == 1, bd->props.brightness == 0
Feb 26 15:11:14 thunder kernel: calling backlight_update_status() with bd->props.fb_blank == 0, bd->props.brightness == 0
Is this really a right thing to do?
