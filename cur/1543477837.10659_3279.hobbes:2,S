I'm running 2.2.0-pre5 on a P2-333, 128mb RAM, 2x Adaptec 2940UW controllers,
Teac 55S CD-R, and Lexmark 1620 attached to the parallel port.  My first 
problem is that I can't print because kerneld didn't figure out it needed to 
load there parport_pc.o module.  When I insmodded the port (as instructed
in parport.txt), it still did nothing.
For the CDROM drive, I was reading in audio CDs.  cdparanoia was working
fine for a while but now hangs before reading the CD (but after loading
in the module).
I was going to install 2.2.0-pre7 tonight, but I'll wait to see if
someone wants to help me run down the problems.
