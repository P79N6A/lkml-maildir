I agree.
Jumping to 0xf000:0xfff0 is widely accepted to be a standard warm
reboot (as *should* an INIT, e.g. triplefault, be, as well -- make
sure A20 is enabled before tripping, though.)  For quite a few (most?)
BIOSes, the vector that is stored at 0xf000:0xfff0 in the running
(BIOS decompressed and shadowed) configuration is *not* the same as
the one at the RESET vector.
