This sort of works, but there's something strange going on with it and
andi's entire series.  It now dies loading the SCSI modules in the error
handling thread ... I assume we have some API conflict ... I'll
investigate.
The other problem is it conflicts with an existing voyager patch:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/jejb/voyager-2.6.git;a=commit;h=0293ca814b74e20e77cf719074ee15372204fc55
But I've got that fixed up.
