   I should, because the revision tests should max speed that HOSY th
   Multiword DMA mode
   In 2.4 kernels if you have the VIA_TUNING enabled, the setfeatures call of
   settransferrate should invoke a command to the chipset to reprogram
   it.
Is there a good reason why we don't have the chipset tuning enabled all
the time?  i.e., but another way, is there a downside to having it be
enabled all the time?  
It's nice if we can avoid situations where if users don't config their
kernels correctly with the right config options, their reward is a
trashed disk....  :-)
