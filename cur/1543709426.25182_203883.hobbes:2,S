Before we start up this larger debate again, might there be some short
term solution for my patch that would satisfy both of you?
If I understand the earlier arguments, if we're going to have the
dynamically relocated segments at some point, I agree that absolute
addresses are going to have problems. However, if I'm not mistaken, this
problem already exists w/ the vsyscall-sysenter code, correct? 
What is the plan for avoiding the absolute address issue there? If I
implemented the vsyscall-gettimeofday code in a similar manner (as
Andrea suggested), could the planned solution for vsyscall-sysenter be
applied here as well?
thanks
