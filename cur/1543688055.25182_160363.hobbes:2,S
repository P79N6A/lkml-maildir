So each process should have three keyrings:
	- Process level (inherited over fork/exec, but not SUID)
	- UID level (fixed to whichever UID a process currently is)
	- GID level (fixed to whichever GID a process currently is)
So the search would proceed through the above list top-down, depth first (each
key can itself be another keyring).
But what about:
	- setuid() and related UID syscalls?
	- setgid() and related GID syscalls?
	- SGID programs?
	- The GROUPS list? Each GID there could have a keyring...
I think changes to UID should cause the process level keyring to be exchanged
for a new empty one, but changes in GID/GROUPS should not. Also I think GROUPS
list specified keyrings can be ignored for now.

If your subset is but a single pre-existing key (where this includes a keyring
as a specialisation of a key), then yes; but if the filesystem is permitted to
select multiple keys from different sources, then no.
I think for the moment, however, we can assume there will be a single key.

Fair enough.

Because not doing so complicates things in other ways. But don't lets worry
about that.

Why? If a process has access to appropriate UID-level or GID-level keys, then
surely it has the rights to do "that", even if it hasn't copied them into its
process level keyring...

Hmmm... if I'm using these keys for AFS, say, then I don't want to have to
search a complete tree of keyrings every time I perform secure operation
(every RxRPC operation possibly). I would like to have the applicable keys
immediately to hand - and only those keys - with as little structure as
possible.

Um. I'm not sure that what you describe is of much use... I'm not sure I
understand correctly what your suggestion is. Can you give an example please?

Exactly there. The ACL would contain a right to (dis)allow modifications to
itself.
Actually, it's more a problem of controlling subscription to arbitrarily
subscribable "named" keys.
For example, say that a process (owned by dwmw2) says "give me access to the
keyring named 'dhowells-session-1275'", then what's to prohibit it from
gaining access to all my keys _unless_ I can add an ACL?
Of course, access control could also be performed UID/GID and mode_t settings,
but that's just a very simple ACL.

But how do you get that other key in the first place?
This sounds a lot more complicated than it needs to be, and slow... To perform
subscription, you then have to search the process's three keyrings for a match
for every conditional key in the target tree...
