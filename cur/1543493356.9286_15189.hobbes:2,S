It is probably not a hardware issue as much as it is an MTA issue. They
are probably running sendmail and might have a large (relatively) number
of subscribers with intermittant connectivity with dedicated IP domains
without a permanently connected MX host. This probably results in the mail
queue backing up as each of the offline sites' emails must time out before
the next is processed. 
I might suggest that vger change to exim.
