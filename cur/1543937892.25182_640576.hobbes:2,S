D'oh! [or something stronger]  I KNEW it was something stupid.  I
thought it strange that there were no reports of something this glaring.
That's why I took so long investigating before I finally asked.
I've used debugfs+mmtrace on x86_64 in the past and I've had the debugfs
mount in my test systems' fstab for so long that I don't even think
about it [obviously!].  I moved to a different test system a couple of
months ago and apparently brought over an old fstab patch.
Sorry for the noise [he says sheepishly].
