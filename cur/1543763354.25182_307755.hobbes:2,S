Yes, sounds good, thanks.
And I'll look into Thomas's suggestions.
Other than "sounds good," are there some comments on:
a.  leaving IrDA and Bluetooth subsystem (with drivers) where they
     are, which is under "Network options and protocols"
	(I really don't want to split their drivers away from their
	subsystem, just to put them under Network driver support.)
b.  leaving SLIP, PPP, and PLIP where they are under Network driver
     support, even though they say that they are "protocols" ?
Any others?
Thanks,
