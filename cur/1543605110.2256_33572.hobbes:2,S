Folks,
Let's stop talking :-) and let's generate some numbers for comparison.
Rik, Andrea, why don't you describe a procedure to generate the numbers for comparison? I have both kernels installed on my machine, so it's easy for me to compare under different loads.
Of couse, I'm new to this stuff, forgive my ignorance :-)
Regards,
Marcelo.
