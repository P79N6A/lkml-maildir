One other thing of note is that certain linux kernel headers _are_  
used by userspace (albeit in a number of cases legacy userspace), and  
as a result we need to ensure that they continue to build on the  
variety of compilers currently used in userspace.  Naturally this  
doesn't apply to everything, but see the recent threads involving  
(IIRC) some part of KDE and indirectly <linux/types.h>.  From what  
Linus has stated in the past it sounds like his goal is to make the  
user<=>libc interface completely 100% separated from the  
libc<=>kernel interface such that neither includes the other, but a  
lot of older userspace violates those assumptions.  As a result, if  
we want older versions of libc's to continue to work in various  
compilers with newer kernel headers we need to maintain some of that  
"compatibility cruft".
That said, if __GNUC__ is mentioned inside __KERNEL__ in anything  
other than a version test then it should probably be removed.  To  
that end these little macros in <linux/compiler.h> might make it a  
bit more obvious what's being tested and make it easier to grep for:
#ifdef __KERNEL__
# define GCC_VERSION ((__GNUC__ << 24) | \
	(__GNUC_MINOR__ << 16) | \
	(__GNUC_PATCHLEVEL__))
# define GCC_AT_LEAST(x,y,z) (GCC_VERSION >= (((x)<<24)|((y)<<16)|(z)))
# define GCC_OLDER_THAN(x,y,z) (!GCC_AT_LEAST(x,y,z))
#endif

I personally tend to agree; seems like some of this cruft is just  
accepted status-quo because it would be so tedious and git-queue- 
blocking to go through and clean it all up.
