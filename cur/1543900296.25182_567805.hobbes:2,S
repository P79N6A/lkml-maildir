I would agree with preliminary testing, save that if you get a lot of 
processes updating the screen at once, there seems to be a notable case 
of processes getting no CPU for 100-300ms, followed by a lot of CPU.
I see this clearly with the "glitch1" test with four scrolling xterms 
and glxgears, but also watching videos with little busy processes on the 
screen. The only version where I never see this in test or with real use 
is cfs-v13.
