2.2.10 seems to be a bit too strict about recognizing CD-ROMS?????
So far, I've only seen one report on this; can't reproduce it anywhere.
Maybe someone else?

Some may remember the hassle I had getting Mandrake 6 to 
recognise the presence of my cdrom drive.
Despite all the various pieces of advice offered I could not get it to 
work - seems the kernel did simply not regosnise its presence. My 
Redhat5.2 installation on boot prints to screen the manufactures 
name etc of hda, then hdb then hdc - 'CDROM ATAPI' - it says.
Mandrake 6 does just this for hda and hdb - then skips over hdc for 
some reason. I tried reinstalling RedHat5.2 (joy - it worked!) - then 
changed the kernel to 2.2.10 (and others 2.2.* incidentally) and 
watched - no hdc on boot! So back to 2.0.36....!
I can only guess that my cdrom is slightly buggy and although 
2.0.36 can cope with this 2.2.* is more fussy and can not? I'll 
change my cdrom drive soon just to see if this is right - and then 
may be I really can use 2.2.10!
For the record though this message is really a public way of saying 
a very warm thankyou to all those of you who considered this 
problem , who took the time the ponder on it, mail me, ask for info, 
suggest fixes etc.
As a sociologist as I can that if the spirit of geneorosity that 
manifests itself in this list was only more prevelent in society 
generally than many social problems would never occur in the first 
place!
So thanks again - there are some really good folk out there!
Bob
