Maybe not really a final version: The __init should remain there if
suspend/resume isn't enabled in the configuration. I'd guess you want
something for this paralleling the __cpuinit/__devinit/module_init stuff
(if these occur very rarely, then doing this inline may of course also
be an acceptable choice). Jan

Hi!
fix_processor_context was calling functions marked __init on x86-64;
bad idea. Maybe we should memset freed memory to zero so such bugs are
prevented?
Thanks to Rafael for keeping notifying me about this bug, and someone
get me yet another brown paper bag.
Anyway, this should fix it, please apply,
								Pavel
