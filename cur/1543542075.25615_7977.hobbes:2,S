Alan, all this userspace stuff is external to the original discussion,
i.e. really irrelevant. The original claim made by Juergen is that native
UW7 lwp are faster than native Linux clone'd tasks. I.e. kernel objects vs
kernel objects comparison. Userspace threads can be fast or slow, I don't
care as long as we discuss the kernel lightweight threads.
And I don't believe that UW7 lwp creation is 1000x faster than Linux
CLONE_VM task creation, until he can prove it.
