That doesn't help. It's against some stupid SUS rule, I'm afraid.
(And THAT is a stupid rule, I 100% agree with. It means that some things
return -EFAULT, and other things do SIGSEGV, and the only difference is
whether something is a system call or is implemented as a library thing.
UNIX should always just have segfaulted, but there you are..)
