Hi all,
Doing my housekeeping today I saw this in logs from last week on one of my 
boxes (2.4.32) with then about 92 days uptime:
Feb 19 14:05:31 quake kernel: hda: irq timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }
Feb 19 14:05:31 quake kernel:
Feb 19 14:05:31 quake smartd[405]: Device: /dev/hda, not capable of SMART 
self-check
Feb 19 14:05:31 quake smartd[405]: Sending warning via  mail to 
root@localhost ...
Feb 19 14:05:31 quake kernel: hda: status timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }
Feb 19 14:05:31 quake kernel:
Feb 19 14:05:31 quake kernel: hda: DMA disabled
Feb 19 14:05:31 quake kernel: hda: drive not ready for command
Feb 19 14:05:33 quake kernel: ide0: reset: success
and looking at drive saw DMA was indeed now off.
At boot:
Uniform Multi-Platform E-IDE driver Revision: 7.00beta4-2.4
ide: Assuming 33MHz system bus speed for PIO modes; override with idebus=xx
PIIX4: IDE controller at PCI slot 00:07.1
PIIX4: chipset revision 1
PIIX4: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
    ide0: BM-DMA at 0xffa0-0xffa7, BIOS settings: hda:DMA, hdb:pio
    ide1: BM-DMA at 0xffa8-0xffaf, BIOS settings: hdc:pio, hdd:pio
hda: IBM-DTTA-371010, ATA DISK drive
blk: queue c02a7560, I/O limit 4095Mb (mask 0xffffffff)
hdc: NEC CD-ROM DRIVE:28B, ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive
ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6 on irq 14
ide1 at 0x170-0x177,0x376 on irq 15
hda: attached ide-disk driver.
hda: host protected area => 1
hda: 19746720 sectors (10110 MB) w/465KiB Cache, CHS=1229/255/63, UDMA(33)
I dunno what happened to the drive that time (this is the only logs of the 
incident) and I turned DMA back on with hdparm - but my question is why is 
DMA turned off and then left off after a reset?
Thanks,
Nick
