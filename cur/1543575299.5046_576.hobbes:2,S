Anton,
I will be able to help "officially" in another 14 months, when the 
inevitability window is closed.  Unfortunately, by then, MS will 
have altered the on-disk structures again, makeing the job even harder.
You and Alan should Brainstorm a solution.  Removing write support or 
putting in a disclaimer would suffice.  It's your call, BTW along 
with Alan.
:-)
