In addition to adding a new feature, you are changing existing code.   
If any one of the changes you made breaks existing behavior, having  
them all in small atomic patches makes it practical to bisect and  
find the problem.
In addition it makes it worlds easier to review by people who are not  
so familiar with your fscache implementation.  And smaller patches  
means the ratio of patch descriptions to code changes can be much  
higher.
It does make sense to introduce the files under fs/fsc in a single  
patch.  But when you are changing code that is already being used,  
more care needs to be taken.

The very latest version (post 1.1.1) is required today for text-based  
NFS mounts.  (That is, the bleeding edge version you get by cloning  
the nfs-utils git repo).
And it only works on kernels later than 2.6.22 -- if that particular  
user is testing fscache on 2.6.22 or older, then only the legacy  
binary NFS mount system call API is supported.

What does that have to do with local disk caching?

Why is it necessary to add additional mtime, ctime and size fields  
for NFS inodes?  Similar metadata is already stored in nfsi.
All I'm asking for is some documentation of what these fields do that  
the existing time stamps and size fields in nfsi don't.  Explain why  
the NFS fsc implementation needs this data structure.

We should explore whether it is typical or even possible that such a  
configuration exports the same file handles on different ports, and  
whether that really matters to the client.

I always do this:  I meant 2.6.25, not 2.6.24.
By the time you return, basic IPv6 support for NFSv4 should be in  
2.6.25-rc1's NFS client (not server).  Not that it is bug-free, but  
an implementation is now there.
