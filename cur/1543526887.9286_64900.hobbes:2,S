Subject: NULL pointer dereference on boot 2.3.4[67]

Hello all...
	I've run into the following problem in 2.3.46 and 2.3.47 where
I get an "Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference" when booting
up.  Any numbers are for my 2.3.47 build (I've already pitched the 2.3.46
and can't confirm that the numbers match).  2.3.45 boots and runs fine
and I used the 2.3.45 config file to build the new config file using
"make oldconfig".
	When booting 2.3.47, I get to the point of ide detection.  I
get the following normal messages just before the failure:
PIIX4: IDE controller on PCI Bus 00 dev 21
PIIX4: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
hdc: ATAPI 44X CDROM, ATAPI CDROM drive
ide1 at 0x170-0x177,0x376 on irq 15
	I should see these messages next (taken from 2.3.45 bootup):
hdc: ATAPI 40X CD-ROM drive, 128kB Cache
Uniform CD-ROM driver Revision: 3.06
	Instead I get:
Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000267
printing eip:
c019a198
*pde=00000000
Oops: 0000
	[...] (I can get the rest of the register dump if anyone needs it,
I just have to copy it down by hand)
	The call traceback is:
	[<c018f4fc>] [<c019a48b>] [<c019a56d>] [<c019a701>] [<c0105000>] [<c010709f>] [<c0107497>]

	System Info:
	CPU:	Pentium III (Katmai)
	Speed:	450 MHz
	Mem:	256M
	Distro:	RedHat 6.1
	gcc:	gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release)
	Problem does not occur on 2.3.45 but does occur on 2.3.46 and 2.3.47
dependably.
	This is also not occuring on another system of mine which is a
RedHat 5.2 system on a 350MHz AMD K6, which is running 2.3.47 just fine.
	Gcc on the K6 system: gcc version 2.7.2.3
	Other differences...  The system which fails has no ide hard drives
and ide0 is disabled (CD-Rom is on ide1).  The system which has not failed
does have an ide hard drive on ide0 and a CD-Rom drive on ide1.
	I've also tried 586 and 686 builds.  All fail (just with different
addresses).
	Attached below is my .config file from this build.
	I have not (yet) tried building the kernel for the P-III system
on the K6 system.  If there is strong reason to suspect the compiler,
I will try that next.
	Any other ideas or suggestions on what to try next?
	Mike
