The modifications between ac9 and ac12 come from the new DMA 
mapping. They added a bug for the (already buggy ?) big-endian
machines. I would be surprised that something has *always* been 
missing in the driver and your hardware triggers it*. IMHO the culprit 
is to be found elsewhere.
I'd like to know what it's worth to share an irq with a pio audio card.
