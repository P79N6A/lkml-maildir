Sometimes you also must supply options to parport_pc in /etc/conf.modules

For LS-120 you need ide-floppy module. And it must be loaded automatically
(along with fat & vfat). IMO something is screwed up due usage of System
Commander (I had this problem with LoadLin)... What `depmod -a' gives ?
P.S. Oh, and talking about depmod, insmod and so on. Are you have modutils
2.1.121 installed as suggested by 
http://www.kernelnotes.org/change22.html
 ?
You can download version for RedHat 5.2 from RedHat's updates site...
