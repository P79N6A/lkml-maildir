You can't fix it.  Talk to keyspan and get it a 2clause BSD or GPL
header and the problem is solved.

Read through the license, especially:
--
Permission is hereby granted for the distribution of this firmware 
image as part of a Linux or other Open Source operating system kernel 
in text or binary form as required. 
--
"as part of the linux kerrnel" is a violation of the GPL, because I
can't use it in my kernel fork, or hurd if they ever get usb support.
Also note that it doesn't mention modification at all.  There's no
way you can legally link it into a GPL'ed program.  I don't know what
you're IP lawyer are smoking, but I could count a few laywers I've
talked to that are active in the Free Software and Creative Commons
world that absolutely disagree with you.  What you say is basically
the GPL is void and works under it are placed in the public domain.
Got a paycheck from SCO recently?
