Problem: Input core help is confusing wrt joysticks
Description:
The input core subsystem is necessary for 2.4 joystick support, even for
non-usb joysticks. "Joystick support" in "Input core support" mentions
only USB joysticks, but is necessary to have a jsX interface at all.
Fix:
The following patch modifies Configure.help's entry for "Input core
support" to state that it is required for any joysticks, and "Joystick
support" under it to remove the reference to USB.
Patch follows:
