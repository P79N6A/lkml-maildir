 	It looks like if ntp_adj held a big negative number you might end 
up with a smaller output . ntp_adj is signed too .. I don't know how 
ntp_adj is set though .
 	I thought I remember George Anzinger speculating that ntp could 
cause the time to backwards , that's why I brought it up. Maybe if he's 
read he can clue us in ..
