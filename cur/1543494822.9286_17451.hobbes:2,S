	I have a PCI card. I am able to read the pci config
	registers by using the pcibios_read_config_xxx calls.
	I get valid values in the Device Id and Vendor Id fields.
	I get a base addresse ( 0xe1xxxxx0). It is memory mapped.
	But when I try to access this address location, the system hangs.
	
	Do I have to remap this address to some other address space.
	How do I go about doing it?
