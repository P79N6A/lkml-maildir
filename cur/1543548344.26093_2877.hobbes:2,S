One of the principal architects at Compaq called me Friday after reading Linus'
email about not caring about commercial or support issues for commercialization
of Linux on this topic-- his right -- it had the anticipated impact I would
expect, and it's rippling through the industry.  This topic on kernel debuggers
and Linux kernel development philosophy has been an unknown to a lot of folks in
the commercial software world for a long time and now Linus has made some things
very clear.
Since Linus has rejected kdb there's every indication he will reject any other
kernel debugger submissions -- also his right.  I think my time would be better
spent completing the merge of the Linux code base onto MANOS since moving the
debugger over to Linux seems to not be something Linus would adopt and it's
contrary to his development philosophy, so it's probably a complete waste of my
time.
If I get time to create a patch for Linux, I'll put it up.  kdb seems to be
already there, so folks can use it on Linux for now, and I'll stick to printk()
and code reviews for my debugging on Linux.
