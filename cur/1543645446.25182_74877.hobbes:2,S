I agree, this is the way started, however it touches so much driver code
(not to mention core code) that it seemed likely to be rejected.  I'm
all for replacing capable() calls, but it's not a consistent interface
and can't always be simply exchanged.  I see no reason not to remove the
obvious ones right away.

Your point is well-taken.  Of course, we do not want to produce
unmaintainable code.  The hook creation/placement has been thought about
and discussed quite a bit.

It was placed there as an obvious contol point over which ioports
could be accessed.  We will definitely revisit this since it's not being
used.

Coming from two separate system calls there is no guarantee the
callers will be in the same execution domain.

sure, uts releated hooks could be collapsed.

yes, again there is no assumption the execution domains would be the
same.

Yes, I agree.  We've had a few patches that did this, nothing
committed to the LSM tree currently.
