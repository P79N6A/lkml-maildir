Thanks for the reply. I was not asking to change the default, I just
want to see the option in e.g. menuconfig. And the help text already has
a very strong advise to leave it at VMSPLIT_3G.
Anyway, I don't want to stress this further: I'm happy enough with my
Kconfig that has "if EMBEDDED" removed for the prompt. 
Best,
