I'll third it.  Just had another machine blow up it's RAID5 set because
of this bug.  Tyan S2895 board, 4 500GB Hitachi SATA drives in RAID5.  I
suppose I could buy a 3ware controller I suppose but that's a few
hundred dollars per machine.
These machines are running SUSE 9.3 or SUSE 10, I've tried kernel.org
kernels as well as the iommu=memaper=3 cmdline option.
Any other advice greatly appreciated.
I saw a lot of patches come through by Muli but am not sure they address
this issue, do they?
