Look at it from the other side: Compare a simple 50-line allocator based
on linked lists which is obviously correct and a complex allocator with
several hundreds lines of code which, although very fast and elegant,
is very far from being understandable in a couple of minutes. And believe
me, bugs in memory allocators are some of the worst to find.
On the other hand, well implemented segment trees might be much more useful for
other stuff, like the vm_area_struct lists.
				Have a nice fortnight
