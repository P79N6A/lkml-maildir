If there's one thing that could be nicer, ioctl() would be it.
ioctl() works ok in C and terribly in everything else.
CORBA works well in scripting languages and Java, and sucks in C
compared with a simple ioctl().
Is there a way to marry the best sides of each?
Is 9P that way (I don't know much about it)?
