I don't think so. There is code to handle it. More likely the tuning
code is wrong and loaded incorrect values. We identify at PIO0 then
select modes.
Best way to test:
Boot with mwdma/udma set to zero in "info" block
then
Boot with only pio 0 claimed as supported and the mode setting logic 
commented out.
That gives a good idea what broke.
