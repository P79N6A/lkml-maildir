It is _not_ allowed to do that for regular UNIX filesystems.
It is allowed to return it for things like pipes, sockets, etc, and for 
filesystems that do not have UNIX behaviour.

It's not the kernel side that is not restartable. It's the _user_ side. 
There is 30 _years_ of history on this, and there are programs that have 
been programmed to follow the existing documentation.
And the existing documentation says that if you return a partial read from 
a normal file, that means EOF for that file.
You may not like it, but that doesn't make it less so. Linux has UNIX 
semantics for read(). Linux is not a research project where we change 
fundamental semantics just because we don't like it. That's final.
