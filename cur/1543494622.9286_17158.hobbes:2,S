I have a strange suspicion this is related to what is happening on our
nameserver machine -- about 5-6 times per day now the "named" process is
locking up with WCHAN in "tcp_close".  Obviously, named then does not
answer any more requests at all.  I just recently caught the WCHAN,
because previously I have been attempting to "strace" the process, but it
seems as soon as the process receives a signal it continues on as normal.
I'm not sure if this really is related or not, but if it's a
wrapping/corrupted timer somewhere, it could well be.
I will run a "netstat -a -n -o" next time I catch it happening to see if
there is actually a wrapping timer.
