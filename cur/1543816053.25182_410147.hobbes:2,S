I'd put it the other way: a control dependency is not "sorted out" by 
branch prediction, it is effectively _nullified_ by branch prediction.
Basically, control dependencies aren't dependencies at all. There is 
absolutely _zero_ dependency between the following two loads:
	if (load a)
		load b;
because the "load b" can happen before the "load a" because of control 
prediction.
So if you need a read barrier where there is a _control_ dependency in 
between loading a and loading b, you need to make it a full "smp_rmb()". 
It is _not_ sufficient to make this a "read_barrier_depends", because the 
load of b really doesn't depend on the load of a at all.
So data dependencies that result in control dependencies aren't 
dependencies at all. Not even if the address depends on the control 
dependency.
So
	int *address_of_b;
	address_of_b = load(&a);
	smp_read_barrier_depends();
	b = load(address_of_b);
is correct, but
	int *address_of_b = default_address_of_b;
	if (load(&a))
		address_of_b = another_address_of_b;
	smp_read_barrier_depends();
	b = load(address_of_b);
is NOT correct, because there is no data dependency on the load of b, just 
a control dependency that the CPU may short-circuit with prediction, and 
that second case thus needs a real smp_rmb().
And yes, if we ever hit a CPU that does actual data prediction, not just 
control prediction, that will force smp_read_barrier_depends() to be the 
same as smp_rmb() on such an architecture.
