At least userspace has chance to mark *really* sensitive stuff as
unswappable. Unfortunately that does not work against swsusp :-(.
[BTW... I was thinking about just generating random key on swapon, and
using it, so that data in swap is garbage after reboot; no userspace
changes needed. What do you think?]

Andreas, these are yours.
