Have seen a problem with the Redhat kernel upgrade after installing new
modutils.  Basically, the problem is that the kernel updater will
install a new kernel, and build a new init ram disk (initrd), but the
2.5 version of modprobe/insmod will get put in the ram disk instead of
the 2.4 version (modprobe.old).  This is fixable, but a nuisance.
