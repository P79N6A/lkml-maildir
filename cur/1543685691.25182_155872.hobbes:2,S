I believe the C language allows for systems where the NULL pointer is
not zero.
I can't think of any reason why the NULL macro exists otherwise.
However, even if I'm right, I dread the guy who has to make other
people's code work on such a platform.  Using normal boolean tests for
NULL pointer checks is just too common.
