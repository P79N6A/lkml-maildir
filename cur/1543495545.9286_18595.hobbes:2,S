I'm not at all familiar with the knfsd code, but I went through
export.c quickly.  It seems that it doesn't keep hold of the dentry
for the filesystem it exports, so if you move a filesystem under it,
it will then try the lookup when accessed and fail (unless you put
another filesystem under it of course).  But accesses to old files
will keep the same dentry and inode, so they will work.  Really, it
shouldn't be any different to the underlying directory being renamed.
Or have I completely missed your point?  (Entirely possible).

Again, I'm not entirely sure I follow :-(  Could you give an example of
the type of thing you're talking about, please?
