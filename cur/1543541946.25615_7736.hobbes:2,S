i'm not sure what bugs he's encountered, but this patch turns the deadlock
detection algorithm from O(n^2) to O(m^2) where n are the number of
locks in the system and m is the number of currently blocked locks.
It's a significant change because the number of unblocked locks is
normally much higher than the number of blocked locks.
