No, this eliminates the whole point of all the abstractions.
Please just use the APIs properly.

How about allocating the tfm(s) (one per cpu on SMP) at module
init time?  That's how I would implement this.
Please try to implement something using the existing APIs.
It's not the size of the cryptoapi core that I'm worries about
(that's only like 1K or 2K on 32-bit systems), it's the SHA1/MD*
code which is a bit  larger.  This might all cancel out once the
SHA1/MD* code is deleted from random.o, and your implementation
will prove/disprove this, and then we can move onto perf analysis.

James, comments?
