Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Version 2 changes:

- Clean up confusing bitfields
- Use random32() instead of local random function
- Use krefs to track endpoint reference counts
- Misc nits
-----
The following series implements the Chelsio T3 iWARP/RDMA Driver to
be considered for inclusion in 2.6.20.  It depends on the Chelsio T3
Ethernet Driver which is also under review now for 2.6.20. See:
http://www.mail-archive.com/netdev@vger.kernel.org/msg26619.html
The patches are against 2.6.19.
