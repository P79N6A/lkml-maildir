The kernel should not be validating -trusted- userland inputs.  Root is 
allowed to scrag the disk, violate limits, and/or crash his own machine.
A simple example is requiring userland, when submitting ATA taskfiles 
via an ioctl, to specify the data phase (pio read, dma write, no-data, 
etc.).  If the data phase is specified incorrectly, you kill the OS 
driver's ATA host state machine, and the results are very unpredictable. 
  Since this is a trusted operation, requiring CAP_RAW_IO, it's up to 
userland to get the required details right (just like following a spec).

hehe.  I think we all agree here...
