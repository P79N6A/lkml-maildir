All the development that SGI is doing on the Linux kernel will be
released under GPL, and that includes page cache and buffer cache
changes we might be making for XFS. Note however that XFS itself
is not part of the kernel but rather a loadable module. The terms
of the XFS license are still being reviewed by our legal staff.
