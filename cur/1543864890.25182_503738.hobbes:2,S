ok, here's one victi^H^H^H^H testbox that seems to match your 
description:
 18:          3          0   IO-APIC-fasteoi   uhci_hcd:usb3, ohci1394
 19:    2413090          0   IO-APIC-fasteoi   uhci_hcd:usb2, libata
 22:        168          0   IO-APIC-fasteoi   HDA Intel
 23:          0          0   IO-APIC-fasteoi   uhci_hcd:usb1, ehci_hcd:usb5
so i should try to generate some missing ACK [this meaning a missing 
driver-level ack, right?] on IRQ#19's libata handler - and i should 
expect a screaming interrupt? Or non-working USB? Or both?
[ i can hunt for other hardware if this doesnt look broken enough to you
  :-) ]
