Is this your message?

You should probably also list the kernel version(s) (uname -a) and cpuinfo
(cat /proc/cpuinfo) just to have some more info to go on.
I don't actually know anything about the cpu frequency scaling myself,
since I just leave my systems running full speed all the time (I use
desktop machines, not laptops).
