Hi,
[Oops, forgot to Cc LKML]
while going through the bio highmem handling code I noticed a small
glitch. __end_that_request_first might modify the bv_offset and bv_len
if the segment was partially completed. The bio-read-bounce-back code
should use the unmodified bv_offset when copying the segment data:
