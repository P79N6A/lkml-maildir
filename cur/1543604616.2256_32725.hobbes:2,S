Actually I'm not using any sound modules, but have a monolithic kernel.
But I just discovered that the emu10k1 driver is not the culprit here.
[So we can take the discussion to emu10k1-devel and drop lkml]
The problem is interaction with emu-tools-0.9.2. The following boot script
was used to setup the DSP (and worked with previous sound drivers).
If you find something wrong with it, please let me know.
