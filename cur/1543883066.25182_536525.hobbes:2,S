hm.  Maybe if we were taking the lock once per N pages rather than once per
page, we could avoid such trickiness.

Where an element would be a page, so we're talking about a 64GB file with
4k pagesize?
Gosh that tree has huge fanout.  We fiddled around a bit with
RADIX_TREE_MAP_SHIFT in the early days.  Changing it by quite large amounts
didn't appear to have much effect on anything, actually.
btw, regarding __do_page_cache_readahead(): that function is presently
optimised for file rereads - if all pages are present it'll only take the
lock once.  The first version of it was optimised the other way around - it
took the lock once for uncached file reads (no pages present), but once per
page for rereads.  I made this change because Anton Blanchard had some
workload which hurt, and we figured that rereads are the common case, and
uncached reads are limited by disk speed anyway.
Thinking about it, I guess that was a correct decision, but we did
pessimise these read-a-gargantuan-file cases.
But we could actually implement both flavours and pick the right one to
call based upon the hit-rate metrics which the readahead code is
maintaining (or add new ones).
Of course, gang-populate would be better.
