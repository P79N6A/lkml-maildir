I have never proposed that management activities be performed solely
within the kernel.  My position has been that meta-data parsing and
updating has to be core-resident for any solution that handles advanced
RAID functionality and that spliting out any portion of those roles
to userland just complicates the solution.

That's unfortunate considering that the meta-data formats we are talking
about already have the capability of expressing RAID 1(E),4,5,6.  There has
to be a common meta-data framework in order to avoid this duplication.

So all of this complexity is still in the kernel.  The only difference is
that the meta-data can *also* be manipulated from userspace.  In order
for this to be safe, the mirror must be suspended (meta-data becomes stable),
the meta-data must be re-read by the userland program, the meta-data must be
updated, the mapping must be updated, the mirror must be resumed, and the
mirror must revalidate all meta-data.  How do you avoid deadlock in this
process?  Does the userland daemon, which must be core resident in this case,
pre-allocate buffers for reading and writing the meta-data?
The dm-raid1 module also appears to intrinsicly trust its mapping and the
contents of its meta-data (simple magic number check).  It seems to me that 
the kernel should validate all of its inputs regardless of whether the
ioctls that are used to present them are only supposed to be used by a
"trusted daemon".
All of this adds up to more complexity.  Your argument seems to be that,
since DM avoids this complexity in its core, this is a better solution,
but I am more interested in the least complex, most easily maintained
total solution.

The simplicity of the user/kernel interface is not what is at stake here.
With EMD, you can perform all of the same operations talked about above,
in just as few ioctl calls.  The only difference is that the kernel and
only the kernel, reads and modifies the metadata.  There are actually
fewer steps for the userland application than before.  This becomes even
more evident as more meta-data modules are added.

I honestly don't care if the final solution is EMD, DM, or XYZ so long
as that solution is correct, supportable, and covers all of the scenarios
required for robust RAID support.  That is the crux of the argument, not
"please love my code".
