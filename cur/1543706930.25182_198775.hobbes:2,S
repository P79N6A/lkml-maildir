I also get a black screen on boot on my IBM X31, but pressing Fn+F7 a 
couple of times brings it up. Fn+F7 switches between LCD, monitor and 
both. Here is my dmesg:
radeonfb: Invalid ROM signature 0 should be 0xaa55
radeonfb: Retreived PLL infos from BIOS
radeonfb: Reference=27.00 MHz (RefDiv=60) Memory=144.00 Mhz, 
System=144.00 MHz
Non-DDC laptop panel detected
radeonfb: Monitor 1 type LCD found
radeonfb: Monitor 2 type no found
radeonfb: panel ID string: 1024x768
radeonfb: detected LVDS panel size from BIOS: 1024x768
