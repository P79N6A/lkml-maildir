There really is if you're expecting a short time later to do
	*p = <expr2>
and had no need for a MS_SYNC anywhere in the meantime.
If you did have the need for MS_SYNC, then kicking off the IO
ASAP is going to be more efficient.

Can he remember what it is? It sounds like it is broken.
OTOH, it could have been blocking on pages already under writeout
but a smarter implementation could ignore those (at the cost of
worse IO efficiency in these rare cases).
