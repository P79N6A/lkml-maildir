I just installed redhat 7.1 on a system.
Cleaning up, a made a fs for home...(mounted on /mnt
to write the stuff to it)
Then I accidently mounted it on /home.
So it was mounted on /home and /mnt at the same time.
(I didn't bother going in to see what was there).
Shouldn't this NOT happen?
[root@pb /]# mount
/dev/hda9 on / type ext2 (rw)
none on /proc type proc (rw)
/dev/hda5 on /boot type ext2 (rw)
/dev/hda7 on /usr type ext2 (rw)
/dev/hda6 on /var type ext2 (rw)
none on /dev/pts type devpts (rw,gid=5,mode=620)
automount(pid603) on /misc type autofs (rw,fd=5,pgrp=603,minproto=2,maxproto=3)
pb:(pid704) on /net type nfs (intr,rw,port=1023,timeo=8,retrans=110,indirect,ma
p=/etc/amd.net,dev=00000007)
/dev/hda10 on /mnt type ext2 (rw)
/dev/hda10 on /home type ext2 (rw)
Is this a feature or a bug?
This is with 2.4.2...
