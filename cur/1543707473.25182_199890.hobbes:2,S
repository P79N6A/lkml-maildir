Why do you focus on linear directory scans?
They simply do not happen under any reasonable IO patterns. You look up 
names under the same name that they are on the disk. So the _only_ thing 
that should matter is the exact match.
The inexact matches should be a case of "make them correct". Screw 
performance. And tell people that they are slower.
Sure, I can imaging that MS would make some benchmark to show that case, 
but at that point I just don't care.
