           Hello Andrea, i`m bothering you just to let you know
     that proper amounts of good documentation never hurts, :)
        I mean that old VM was pretty good documented so there was a good
     number of folks who understood it and were able to help to
     develop it. Now i start to fear that with the current situation
     some months later folks will start to argue between them of how
     this VM works... bad perspective...
           Please Andrea, i think i`m not alone in this praise, 
     give the community the password to the magic land :-)
regards, Samium Gromoff
