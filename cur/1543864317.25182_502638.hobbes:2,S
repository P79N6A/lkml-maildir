The very early archives are available on the web:
http://www.kclug.org/old_archives/linux-activists/
And I'm under the impression that Alan Cox once collected a complete set of 
mbox archives, but this is a vague an unfocused recollection of something 
going by years ago.  (I also thought the result was downloadable under 
kernel.org/pub somewhere.  This would not appear to be the case.)
