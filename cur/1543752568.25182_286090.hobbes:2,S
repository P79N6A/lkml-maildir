I'm sorry but I disagree with this. Most of the security flaws in the
kernel are NOT buffer overflows. Almost none are! (and that is because
in the linux kernel you are very much stack constrained and can't put
large-ish buffers on the stack).
Userland.. that's a different matter.
Propolice is one of the options there, there are others too. But for the
kernel, buffer overflows are really rare (esp ones that propolice and
other tools can catch).
