Ah...:-)  Badari used 0x80000 for DELAYED_ALLOC in the previous patch
(2.6.11 based).When moving those patches forward to 2.6.13-rc3, we found
the conflict with QUOTA, and obviously picked up a wrong value.

Okey, will think a new name for this feature to avoid confusion.  Alex's
delalloc is bond to extent tree structure so it's hard to be adopted
directly to the current ext3 layout, so, I'd say this work done by
Badari(inspired by Alex's work) is a different implementation.

Fixed. 
Thanks for looking at this.
