Yes.  I have changed my mind regarding your earlier proposal; I now think
it's best to make it "mandatory" for remove() to unregister all children.  
"Mandatory" in the sense that not doing so will provoke a big fat WARN_ON
complaint.
Having device_del() call itself recursively is not a good idea.  It would
destroy that guarantee that no one but the creator of a device will
unregister it.

That might confuse udev, but otherwise it could be okay.

When (if) such a file is added, it should contain more than just these few

Yes.

It doesn't really have to.  The driver core could do it.

It should never need to make that transition.  The only routines in the
driver which get passed a pointer to the device (as opposed to a pointer
to the private data) should be the methods called by the driver core or
sysfs.  Neither will make any calls to the driver after remove() has
returned, unless the driver does something wrong.

A trivial omission on my part -- "The driver must also retain a module 
reference to the owner of the device (unless the driver is itself the 
device's owner)."

If every driver follows this rule, we may not need the kobject->owner 
stuff.  Although it wouldn't hurt to keep it for safety's sake.

:-)  Actually this should be a little more general, since the device will 
generally be embedded in a larger structure created by the subsystem.  The 
driver should also be able to acquire and release locks in that larger 
structure.
On a related topic, I complained before about the problem with char device
unregistration.  Below is an example patch showing how the USB mechanism
can be made safe.  It should be easy to understand, even for people who
aren't familiar with how the USB core works.  Basically it amounts to
replacing a spinlock with an rwsem, which can then be held throughout an
entire call to an f_op->open() method.
Without something like this, we face a potential race:
	Driver				User
	------				----
					usb_open(inode);
					Look up iminor(inode) in the table
						of minors
	remove():
	call usb_deregister_chrdev():
	Entry is removed from the
		table of minors
					Call f_op->open():
					Private data matching the minor
						number is located
	Minor info is removed from
		the private data
	Private data is deallocated
	remove() returns
					Try to use the private data
It's true that there are other ways of preventing this scenario, but they 
put the burden on the device driver instead of on the subsystem.  They 
also tend to be somewhat fragile and often involve the BKL.  This way is 
simple and general.  Is there any reason it shouldn't be used by every 
subsystem that maintains a table of minors?
