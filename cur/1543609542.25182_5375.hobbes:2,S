You'll find a post from me there back in October, and a patch to X (and a 
binary module) linked to. The files are still there, and contains details 
on how to try the work-around.

Probably a Clevo, they make a lot of notebooks. Then again, you never know.

Gotta love reference designs.

The sisfb driver changes appeared in 2.4.13-ac4, so I'd guess they'd be in 
2.4.13-ac8. Unfortunately (afaik) Alan hasn't gotten much in the way of 
e-mail response from SiS on his questions. The driver made an appearance 
early in the 2.4 series, and was 'reverted' back to the old one as SiS 
didn't respond to questions about the code, which afaik seemed "inconsistent".
Can you e-mail me (may as well be off-list) the dump of 'lspci -bv' please? 
I'm interested in checking up on the revision differences between our 
chipsets. Should give me something to start with on the audio front, and 
hopefully on the video front I can get the same info from people without 
problems, so I can figure out what revisions have this problem. Any others 
who either have this video problem, or don't have it (SiS630 chipsets only 
at the moment, and I know a few people are keeping an eye out for topics 
with SiS630 in them like I am), feel free to e-mail me your output from 
'lspci -bv' as well. The more info I get, the more likely we can narrow 
this down.
