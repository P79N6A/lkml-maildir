You could just get rid of the process/sighand/whatever reference
entirely and just make reads on a signalfd always dequeue signals for
the current thread.
You'd lose the ability to pass signalfds around to other processes, but
I'm not convinced that is even useful. (But I'm sure somebody smarter
than me has a valid use case and would love to share :-)
