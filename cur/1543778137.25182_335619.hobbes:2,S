I doubt that _any_ of the regressions that are user-visible are
scheduler-related. They all tend to be disk IO issues (bad scheduling or
just plain bad drivers), and then sometimes just VM misbehaviour.
People are looking at all these RT patches, when the thing is that most
nobody will ever be able to tell the difference between 10us and 1ms
latencies unless it causes a skip in audio.
