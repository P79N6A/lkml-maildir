I know kernel development well.  Just because I don't know some silly 
application, and haven't taken the time to learn it, that is VERY
orthogonal to being able to understand the algorithms in the kernel.
Just because someone doesn't know the random voodoo to make program
X do action Y, and the documentation is lacking, doesn't mean that 
I don't understand OS design, or general relativity.  I wouldn't ask
a biochemist to tell me how various page eviction routines impact the 
performace of the system, but I respect their intelligence anyway.  
Not knowing silly commands for a text editor is NOT a lack of 
intelligence, but that attitude seems to be popular within the 
community.  And it has probably done a good job of alienating some
really good programmers.  
So saying "If you can't do this, you shouldn't be working with the 
kernel" is a form of exclusivism/elitism, and I thought Linux was
about democratization, at least according to the propaganda.  Just
because all of the default editors on Linux have obscure commands
to do line wrap, doesn't mean that I don't know what I'm doing.  
Believing such is arrogant pretention, and a self ego-stroking/
intellectual masturbation in front of a mirror.
If I have a problem with the way someone's doing something, I tell them 
a possible fix.  I don't give them a smart ass answer.  (Unless I'm in
a really bad mood... ;-)

Thank you again.  This is the kind of helpfullness that would be more
appreciated on the list.  Thank you for serving as a good example! ;-)

Oh, that was more directed at the list.  ;-)  Problems with listservs, 
the recipient is ambigous!
