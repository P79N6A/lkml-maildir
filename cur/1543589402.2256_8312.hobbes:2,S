Hi there,
I found a quite interesting file: arch/i386/kernel/dmi_scan.c
It should print some DMI values at boot. As far as I remember, I've seen
these at times of 2.4.0 or so. Now these outputs are deactivated with a 
#define dmi_printk(x)
Can someone explain why this has been deactivated? I would find these
values quite useful!
TIA, Michael
