 You can reduce i8259A accesses by setting i8259As into the AEOI mode,
which fits Linux very well.  In this mode you need not to send EOIs to the
chips, only to mask an IRQ on entry and unmask it on exit (which is done
now anyway).  As a result, you save a few i8259A accesses every interrupt. 
 Unfortunately, this sucks horribly for level-triggered interrupts on APIC
systems working in virtual wire mode (that is running UP kernels or with
"noapic"  option).  As such it's not suitable as a general solution but if
you have a specific need and need not run virtual wire mode
configurations, than this may be good for you.  Writing appropriate code
is not difficult; I may dig my old patches if you want to see a (possibly
not working) example.
