Hello all,
     I have problems with USB in recent kernels (tested on 2.5.56) and
RedHat 8.0. Right after end of script  '/etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit' and before
script '/etc/rc.d/rc' which runs after USB  daemon khubd gets some signal
and ends. From this point USB does not work as as system does not get any
plug events. If I disable USB at startup and load modules later, everything
works.
     Under 2.4.x kernel everithing works as expected.
