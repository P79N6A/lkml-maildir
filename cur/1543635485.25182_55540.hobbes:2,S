I'd still say no. Kernel messages are meant not meant for end users but for
kernel developers. The latter all speak english, but chances are that most
of them won't understand japanese kernel messages. So they would need to
be translated back before posted here.
If you want translated kernel messages, use message IDs, that can be parsed
and translated in userspace, if somebody really needs it.
