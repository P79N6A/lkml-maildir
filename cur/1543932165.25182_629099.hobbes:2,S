Sure.  And yes, I very much do prefer code that uses C as it ought to be
used and doesn't play games with casts from hell, etc.  For a lot of reasons,
both correctness- and efficiency-related.
We _do_ have such turds.  In spades.  And such places are potential timebombs,
since well-intentioned idiotic patch ("I've read in lecture notes that sizeof
is better than explicit constant, so replacement surely can only improve the
things and the best part is, I don't need to understand what I'm doing")
turns an ugly FPOS into equally ugly FPOS that silently doesn't work ;-/
[sorry about the rant, I'm about 3/4 through the drivers/net colonoscopy,
with >300Kb of patches and a pile of assorted bugs so far - and then there's
drivers/scsi to deal with.  Endianness stuff, mostly...]
