You don't understand the initial problem.  This is that
	kill(SIGSTOP);
	ptrace(PTRACE_CONTINUE)
is interrupting syscalls as well.  It is fine if signals in general
interrrupt syscalls.  But SIGSTOP & friends, undone by a ptrace() call
should not return since these kind of things happen when because of
reasons outside the program.  I user hitting ^Z or gdb stopping and
restarting a process.  The behaviour of the program is changed
dramatically.
