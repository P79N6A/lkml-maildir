Oh.  I kinda sorta agree. If the continuous nanosecond thing happens,
it'll make things _much_ easier.  I actually have exactly one testcase
that actually requires nanoseconds as things stand, and that one I've
worked around in the past.  The rest of my desire to increase accuracy
stems from instrumenting timeslice enforcement.  Statistical at best,
and truly sad at worst.
