As I understand it VESA 0x4F04 is for saving/restoring mode state, not
restoring the video card from poweroff. Correct me if I'm wrong here.
Secondly if you wanted to do this cleanly you could still do the save
from vm86 in user space and the restore on the 16bit return path having
checked a save was made and that the video bios hasn't gone for a walk.
