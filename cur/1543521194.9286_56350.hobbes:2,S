Subject: unresolved symbols in module

A while back I wrote an EPP parallel port driver for kernel 2.0.36. I'm
just now getting around
to updating the driver code for the more recent kernels. I have code
that compiles for 2.2.13,
but insmod complains about unresolved symbols for calls like printk,
kmalloc, etc. I have
a version of my driver working for 2.2.5 that does not have this
problem. I have poked around
on most of the relevant web sites and documentation, but I have not
found any indication of what 
changed to cause this. I'm sure its pretty simple. Could anyone point me
in the right direction
to resolving this problem? 
Other info: 
I'm compiling for i386. 
the version info on gcc is:
Reading specs from /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i686-pc-linux-gnu/pgcc-2.91.66/specs
gcc version pgcc-2.91.66 19990314 (egcs-1.1.2 release)
(I don't think this matters at all, but...) mandrake 6.1 distribution
