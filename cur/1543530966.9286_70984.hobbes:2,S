I do have (rough) numbers from a large WWW site I ran quite recently.
I often had 100 or more processes running at once, alongside many 
other jobs (including satellite image processing) on a box with just
over 1Gb of VM. Without overcommit, the processes would not have
fitted in VM - even if I had killed every other process running.

Yes, I have. Why do you want to remove one of the key benefits of Unix
platforms?

The kernel doesn't do that anyway (unless you have explicitly disabled
sanity checking). With or without normal overcommit, the behaviour
here is identical; the only difference is in whether or not you really
populate the whole block of address space you requested BEFORE you use
it.
