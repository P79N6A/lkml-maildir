You are wrong.
ar r module.a module-symbol-versions-copyright-or-whatever
ar r vmlinuz.a symbol-versions-from-System.map
(Perhaps the ld variant with some section magic would be
  looking prettier and technically more correct.)
Shared libraries for example don't look up stuff like this inside
themselfs. (Unless you look at DLL stubs...)
It's the ld.so programm which maintains such data.
modutils don't do anything different from classical late binding.
The natural place for such maintainance work could be for example
the init process, which serves already pretty a similar role for
the kernel like ld.so does for user land applications. It would
provide a convenient point for possible synchronization...
Another analogy is the rpm dependency maintainance.
It's the rpm program - which does checking here and not
the actual application itself during the file-system install.
