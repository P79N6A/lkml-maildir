   And a pretty straightforward one, too. Convert the internal reiserfs
   link stuff to an unsigned short, find NLINK_MAX using the code I posted
   last night (or maybe simply grab it from userspace includes) and add
   a check to your stat() code to return NLINK_MAX if necessary.
Whose stat() code?  These go straight to userspace via normal
syscalls.
It has to be done generically, in the VFS or reiserfs.
