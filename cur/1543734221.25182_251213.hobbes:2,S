In my expierence XFS, was right after JFS the worst and the slowest 
filesystem ever made.
Since than, I am using reiserfs 3.6. I don't need quota for my servers, 
but there is patch avaliable for it I belive, from SuSE.
ReiserFS is da most reliable FS for linux (with journaling). If you 
don't need journaling, ext2 is da choice.
