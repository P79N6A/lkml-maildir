Very often the case is that they indeed can be merged automagically.
For example two patches inserting few lines right after the #include
lines.
patch1:
@@ 10,1 10,2 @@
 #include <foo.h>
+#include <1.h>
patch2:
@@ 10,1 10,2 @@
 #include <foo.h>
+#include <2.h>
The patch will fail to patch :-). But there is no real conflict between
the patches.

diff3 comes from gnu diffutils
<
ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/diffutils/diffutils-2.7.tar.gz>.
 But all it does
is comparing three FILES for differencies.
