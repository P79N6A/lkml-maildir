Unfortunately not all went well with this:
make -f scripts/Makefile.build obj=drivers/video/matrox
   gcc -Wp,-MD,drivers/video/matrox/.matroxfb_base.o.d -D__KERNEL__ -Iinclude -Wall 
-Wstrict-prototypes -Wno-trigraphs -O2 -fno-strict-aliasing -fno-common -pipe 
-mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 -march=athlon -Iarch/i386/mach-generic -fomit-frame-pointer -nostdinc 
-iwithprefix include -DMODULE   -DKBUILD_BASENAME=matroxfb_base -DKBUILD_MODNAME=matroxfb_base 
-DEXPORT_SYMTAB  -c -o drivers/video/matrox/matroxfb_base.o drivers/video/matrox/matroxfb_base.c
In file included from drivers/video/matrox/matroxfb_base.c:105:
drivers/video/matrox/matroxfb_base.h:52:25: video/fbcon.h: No such file or directory
... and downwards thereafter.
