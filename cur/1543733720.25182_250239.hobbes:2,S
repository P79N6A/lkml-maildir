Nope. It might change the access model for some user space applications.

Who says PCI is a top level bus. You can have PCI bridges on a different
top level bus on some systems - totally independant. Not sure if you can
hot plug PCI root bridges on any parisc boxes but that would sure be
fun.

Some of the NUMA x86 boxes have multiple I/O spaces too. So your I/O
address effectively includes a "system node" section.
