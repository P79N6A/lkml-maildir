32.768kHz crystals are pretty much standard for use in digital clocks.  
Checking an electronics catalogue shows a fairly reasonable -60ppm to 
+30ppm rating over the operating temperature range (implying the device 
is tuned for 20C room temperature).

That's one thing I truely dislike about the current timer code.  If we 
could program the RTC interrupt to come into the system as an NMI (iirc 
oprofile already has code to do this), we could get much better TSC 
interpolation since we would be sampling the TSC at a much smaller, less 
variable offset, which can only be a good thing.
