If the purpose of not having a 2.7 branch or longer RCs is to have people test 
the latest vanilla, you can't simultaneously send users away.
I maintain a number of servers and don't like to depend on a distro for the 
kernel. I do my tests before deployment and can live with some problems in a 
specific release (noone is perfect), but I'd like to have a plan B without 
creating my own branch.
Having security patches in a 2.6.(x-1).y would allow me to test the latest 
vanilla AND have stable production servers without the rush that usually 
accompanies a new release followed by a vulnerability.
