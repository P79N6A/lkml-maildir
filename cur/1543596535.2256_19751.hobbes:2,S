No 32-bit Linux system could exceed 1 TB on anything until this week.
This is caused by signed 32-bit math on units of 512 bytes.
Now there are experimental patches for larger devices.
The file access API was limited to signed 32-bit byte values.
Officially, this was fixed for the 2.4 series. Most distributions
shipped 2.2 series kernels with patches to allow large files.
The ext2, FAT, and NFSv2 filesystems all had a 32-bit file
size limit. For ext2 this was lifted just as the 2.2 series
came out, but only Alpha systems could use the large files.
FAT has not been fixed. NFSv2 has been replaced by NFSv3.
EXT2FS_VERSION has not been updated because feature flag bits
are being used instead.
I have a graph of ext2 limits:
