Chicken and egg problem.  modprobe uses syslog which needs Unix sockets
which triggers kmod to load net-pf-1 which calls modprobe ...  This
patch from Maciej W. Rozycki against modutils 2.3.[78] is a temporary
workaround.  I'm looking for a more general fix to detect kmod
recursion, but it looks like it can only be fixed with kernel changes.
