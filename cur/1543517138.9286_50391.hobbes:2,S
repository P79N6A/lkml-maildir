this small patch against pre2-2.3.20 changes ioremap to always map UC. PCI
apperture is not cached anyway, so the only effect is on store-forwarding.
[and store-forwarding is exactly the kind of thing we do not want to
happen in 99% of the PCI drivers.] Drivers which use ioremap_nocache()
should change to plain ioremap() until 2.4.
