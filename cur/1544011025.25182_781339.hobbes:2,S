With sizeof(ei->i_data) = 15 * 4 = 60 bytes, this will set ei->i_data[60]
as NUL, which is writing 1 byte beyond the end of the array.
Note that in ext[234]_symlink() the check for fast symlinks is:
	l = strlen(symname)+1;
        if (l > sizeof (EXT3_I(inode)->i_data)) {
		inode->i_op = &ext3_symlink_inode_operations;
	} else {
		inode->i_op = &ext3_fast_symlink_inode_operations;
		inode->i_size = l-1;
	}
so in fact the fast symlinks should always have space for a trailing NUL
character, and "sizeof(ei->i_data) - 1" is the right maxlen to use for
ext[234].
That might not be true for other filesystems, in which case you would
need to add a "padding" field after the symlink name in memory to hold
the trailing NUL.
Cheers, Andreas
