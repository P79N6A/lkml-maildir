It does hide something.  It hides *the implementation* of
the function hypot().
In effect, elsewhere in your code you could have the explicit
	... = sqrt((x * x) + (y * y));
or,
	... = hypot(x, y);
It's just eliminating (code) redundancy and duplication.
I.e. this addendum was meant on a more abstract/logical ground, thus the
name of the chapter.

This isn't really my rule.  I didn't invent or came up with anything
new here.
Documentation/CodingStyle is remarkably similar to most of what
you'd find in [1], and those rules are more or less from that
same book.
Actually, the whole point of my posting the patch is the last rule,
since well thought out data representation makes or breaks the code.
