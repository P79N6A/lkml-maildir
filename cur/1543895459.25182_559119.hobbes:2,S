Unfortunately, I can't do OLS this year, but anyone who wants to talk on
these things can drop me a line and we can setup phone calls or whatever
for planning.  Adding polish to any FS is not a one man show, and so I know
I'll need to get more people on board to really finish btrfs off.
One of my long term goals for btrfs is to figure out the features and
layout people are most interested in for filesystems that don't have to
be ext* backwards compatible.  I've got a pretty good start, but I'm
sure parts of it will change if I can get a big enough developer base.

Definitely.  There's a lot of work in the DM integration bits that are
not FS specific.
