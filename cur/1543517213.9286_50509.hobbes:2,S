Thanks for the info, I'm sure somebody has talked about this before, but I
must have forgot about it. Hmm, what should we do here? One (easy) way
would be to remove irda_proto_init from net/protocols.c and insert it in
front of irda_device init in main.c. What do you think, would this fix the
problem?
