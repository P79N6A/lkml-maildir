But where would the kernel adjust them?
This is truly _trivial_ to do when we have a fixed mapping: we not only
have the code (that the kernel controls and can change depending on
features like a broken TSC or newfangled TSC's like the Coppermine one
that changes frequency), but we'd also have the above kind of embedded
structure that is NOT exported to user space explicitly.
It's impossible to do sanely if we have a generic notion of MAP_INHERIT
which can be used by user space in an uncontrolled manner. And that's the
problem.
