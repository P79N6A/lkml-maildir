I don't know if this will help with the decision to make 2.2.0-final the
official release, but here's some info.
1) I am NOWHERE near as techinically knowledgable about the kernel as you
the developers and thus am looking from the average user viewpoint.
I installed the source ona RH 5.2 x86 AMD K6 PR166MMX machine. I upgraded
only what the development required files list was from www.linuxberg.com. I
did a make mrproper ; make menuconfig. I kept everything as it was except I
removed the SCSI support as I have no SCSI. I did a make dep ; make clean;
make modules; make modules_install; mv /boot/System.map-2.0.36-3
/boot/System.map-OLD20363; rm /boot/System.map; cp
/usr/src/linux/System.map /boot/System.map-2.2.0-final; ln -s
/boot/System.map-2.2.0-final /boot/System.map; linuxconf
Pretty much a straightforward install. It compiled wthout any errors at all
as did the modules. Once I gave linuxconf the info needed to install
another default boot, I rebooted. No problems except for errors in the
module depends for IPX and NSF (still get that to this minute no idea why
either)
Next I ran all the apps i usually use like Tkrat, Netscape, KDE, and gnome
based apps. (I am at glibc2.0.7 at this point) all with no crashes or
propblems except for slaggy tcp connections.
next I upgraded to glibc2.0.109 and recompiled again this time streamlining
for my exact hardware ONLY. again no problems except for the IPX and NSF
error messages.
Well, maybe one but I think it's the glibc. Everything lags for like less
than a full second then runs at normal speed. also, the TCP problems are
worse. I deisabled the hardware throttling in the kernel and still get it.
I don't know if this is the kernel or the pppd causing the problems.
(Thought it might be the kernel cause of the hardware throttling options
for the NIC cards but remember I removed those 2nd time around.)
Other than the IPX and NSF module errors about undefined symbols, the sort
of "lag" of the system every like 45 to 50 seconds for a less-than-a-second
period, and the TCP slaggy connections, everything works perfectly fine for
a default install.
One other problem is Sig11 errors when trying to run Quake 2 in either
ref_soft or ref_gl modes. THIS problem does NOT happen in the 2.0.36 kernels.
just an idea for you to look at if you want. (For now, i'll play quake
under Win98 if I really wanna play that bad.) If anyone needs more info on
anything I have mentioned let me know. I'm writing cause I have always felt
user feedback to develoeprs is key to better development. hehehe
Night all. And thanks for such a great OS, Linus! Ya got a hard working
bunch of folks helping ya too. (Been watching linux since 1.0.9 but using
since 1.0.10)
