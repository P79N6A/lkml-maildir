That limitation stems from ECC and ECC is done in software.  Currently
everyone and his dog is doing ECC in chunks of 256 bytes on NAND.  So
your minimum write size is 256 bytes _if you care about ECC_.  If you
don't care, you can write single bits on NAND, just as you can on NOR.
Controlling ECC in software means we are quite flexible.  Given
sufficient incentive, we can change the rules quite significantly.
