This is a hard limit that is part of the Sun RPC's 'UNIX
authentication' scheme. The X/Open group specifies the RPC definition
as
struct auth_unix {
           unsigned int stamp;
           string machinename<255>;
           unsigned int uid;
           unsigned int gid;
           unsigned int gids<16>;
       };
Please note that other authentication schemes (DES, Kerberos etc.)
define completely different structures.
Cheers,
  Trond
