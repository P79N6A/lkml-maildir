I must admit, I don't think I've even seen a tab before (not that you'd
actually _see_ a tab). Oh, grep tells me that powernow uses it. By the
time that gets through syslog it's changed into "^I", so it would
probably be better to not actually use tabs, either (or fix syslog).
New patch below outputs as \xxx if it's not a "nice" character.  "Nice"
is now 32..126, \n and \t.
