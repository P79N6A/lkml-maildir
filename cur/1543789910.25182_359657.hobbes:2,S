It was advertised as "SAS BOF" -- the person who wrote that on the message
board (reading this list currently) can verify that.

I still am.  What everyone now wants is SDI. And as you can see I've posted
several times _code_ and templates as to how to do a backend which would
work as per spec and a front end which would be adjustable to the whims of
"the community", sg/sysfs/whatever1/whatever2.
I think SDI will completely satisfy everyone's needs, independently of
the fact whether the the protocol is hidden in the FW or not.
In fact Fusion MPT is very cool: you only add a few PCI IDs and your
hw works with the same driver!  And if you care about protocol
specifics: use SDI.
But the community wanted involvement so then you say: "No! Give us
your hardware, we'll do it for you." and then you get into this
never-ending goose chase, implementing the wrong thing, the wrong way,
as opposed to _listening_ to what is actually wanted.

Sorry you feel this way.  I don't remember you saying anything about
SAS.
