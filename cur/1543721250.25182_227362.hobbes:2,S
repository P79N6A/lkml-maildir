Hello
I have discovered that make menuconfig entries are inclusively cross-dependent.
It means that if I disable and re-enable something that masks more entries,
the entries are reset into their default state.
Toggling one checkbox can apparently cause toggling of another checkbox of the
another checkbox is masked by the first checkbox.
I would like to know if toggling one checkbox can cause toggling another
checkbox even in the case the second checkbox is not masked by the first one.
