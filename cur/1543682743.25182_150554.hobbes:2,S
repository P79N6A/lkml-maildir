BUG REPORT
Build fails for ia64 with linux-2.6.0-test1-bk2 with missing file.
Description of problem:
1.  Pulled 2.6.0-test1
2.  Pulled 2.6.0-test1-bk2 patch
3.  Applied bk2 patch to 2.6.0-test1
4.  make menuconfig
5.  make compressed modules
Failed with the following:
   kernel/profile.c:11:26: asm/sections.h:  No such file or directory
   kernel/profile.c: In function `profile_init':
   kernel/profile.c:38: `_etext' undeclared (first use in this function)
   kernel/profile.c:38: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
   kernel/profile.c:38: for each function it appears in.)
   kernel/profile.c:38: `_stext' undeclared (first use in this function)
   make[1]: *** [kernel/profile.o] Error 1
   make: *** [kernel] Error 2
Proposed Solution:
I believe that the include/asm/sections.h files needs to be linked to one of
the incude/asm-arch/sections.h files.
Keywords:
ia64, build, sections.h
