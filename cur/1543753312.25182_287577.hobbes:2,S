Subject: [PATCH] Remove nonsensical list function list_for_each_safe_rcu
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Name: Remove nonsensical list function
Status: Trivial
Signed-off-by: Rusty Russell <rusty@rustcorp.com.au>
The correct use of list_for_each_safe_rcu is a coding puzzle which
minor minds such mine are not capable of solving.  Please remove this
obstacle on my path to enlightenment.
