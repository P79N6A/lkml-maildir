because NR_IRQS is increased. and MSI irq is back counting from NR_IRQS - 1.
we have patch in sparse_irq, will start dyn irq for MSI from
nr_irqs_gsi ( the max irq ioapic will use) .. ( according to Thomas)
before that reach mainline, the effects for you is wasting some space
from some big irq_desc[].
but only 450... that is not bad.
