You should have said "a solution", not "the solution", above.  For the Ext2/3 
HTree index, we found a rather nice solution that varies the hash dispersion 
pattern on a per-volume basis, in a way that's difficult for a DOSer to 
reconstruct (please feel free to analyze this approach and find a hole, if 
there is one).
This is much simpler than what you propose.  As we are talking core kernel 
here, adding an extra spiderweb of complexity in the form of multiple hash 
algorithms really isn't appealing, if it can be avoided.  Not to mention the 
overhead of indexing into the correct hash algorithm on each lookup.

Translation: adding bloat is often the easy way out for the lazy.  Anyway, 
thanks for your analysis, but I disagree with your recommendation.
