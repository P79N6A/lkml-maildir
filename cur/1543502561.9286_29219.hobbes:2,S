You must be confusing it with 2.0 {put,get}_user or with 2.2 __get/__put_user. 
There it was/is true.
2.2 *_user all do full
memory verification. What doesn't are the __ variants (__get_user, __put_user
etc.). They do exception handling for invalid user pages, but don't check
if the destination or source is a kernel address. So only use them when
when you checked the range earlier with another *_user or a verify_area. 
get_user(bla, ptr) is equivalent (but slightly more efficient) to
copy_from_user(&bla, ptr, sizeof(bla)). Similar for put_user/copy_to_user.

P.S.: I'm thinking about writing some section 9 pages for the basic stable
functions of the kernel to clear such myths in future. Mostly only for the
basic kernel infrastructure (e.g. locks, user access, interrupts), not for
the evolving parts.
