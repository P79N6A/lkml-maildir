So did we just get your issues sorted? I _think_ *snip* is the
Howells code for "OK", but I can never be sure ;)
FWIW, as a rule, ClearPageUptodate should never be done by anyone,
least of all a filesystem on regular file pagecache. I need to go
through and audit this stuff... but so much backlog :P
