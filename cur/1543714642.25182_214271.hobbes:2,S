Hmm, do you mean that existent SATA drives on current 2.4.x kernels where 
"seen" as /dev/hdX and with the SATA merge will be /dev/sdX ? I dont think 
2.4.x supported SATA (at least not on Intel). I have a ICH5 motherboard 
with one PATA drive and one SATA drive. With 2.6.5 kernel with support for 
IDE PIIX (in the ATA section) and SATA PIIX (in the SCSI low level drivers 
section) I see my PATA as /dev/hda and my SATA as /dev/sdb (I have another 
SCSI disk on a SCSI controller which is /dev/sda). So it does seem to me 
to do the right thing. Also on 2.4.25 with PIIX support I only saw the 
PATA disk. In BIOS the PATA/SATA configuration is set to "Enhanced". More 
informations:
