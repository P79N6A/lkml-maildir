Whooha, really? While I honor the acpi-folks' work when using a desktop 
machine I am otherwise always reminded to the comment in 
arch/i386/kernel/apm.c, which basically says: "write bios code, does it 
compile? does it boot win98? ->ship it" ;))

I only thought it was the other way around: less (active, used) code - 
less bug (caused by strange ACPI implementations). But I can see your 
point.

I'm happy to do this with the new cpufreq interface, but right now I 
could not care less about saving power :(
