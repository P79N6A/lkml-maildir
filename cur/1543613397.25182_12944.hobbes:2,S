As you may recall from chemistry classes, a buffer is a solutee that
reduces pH  variations. Since the initials VGA in IBM's display
adapter stand for, "video graphics array," I recommend changing the
name of the devices from "framebuffer" to "video array." I shall
like to know what other people think.
