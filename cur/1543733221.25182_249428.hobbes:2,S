Actually we should probably #ifdef the whole change_page_attr() mess
on CONFIG_AGP; any box that cares about the overhead will be headless
and thus able to remove the state maintenance on behalf of AGP. AGP's
introduction of physical aliases (i.e. 2 physical addresses aliasing
the same memory) without cache coherency protocol support was beyond
insane and people should be able to opt out of the overhead when they
don't want or need AGP support.
