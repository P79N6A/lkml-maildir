Do you mean it was really left intentional?
Unbeleivable! But why the other parts of a
hrtimer API are exported nevertheless, and
only this particular function not?
As for the users - I am porting my pcsp driver to
it and I need that function.
It is not exactly in-tree stuff, but it was
in an ALSA tree for years already, so it is a
close one.
