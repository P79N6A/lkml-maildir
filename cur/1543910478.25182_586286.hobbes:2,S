It is just to avoid error if we compile kvm module outside of the kernel, with
kernel without support of guest accounting. Can be removed if you want.

No, empty function.
It is just to introduce "symmetry" in code, the VCPU code begins with
"kvm_guest_start()" and ends with "kvm_guest_exit()". And we have no operation
to do in kvm_guest_exit() (the PF_VCPU is cleared by account_system_time()), so
"empty function", removed by the optimizer (I hope).
