Subject: [PATCH]  d_delete in jffs causes oops (2.5.48)

jffs_remove calls d_delete(dentry). vfs_unlink then tries to access dentry->d_inode->i_sem
and calls d_delete(dentry). 
Suggested patch:
--- inode-v23.c	20 Nov 2002 11:57:45 -0000	1.4
+++ inode-v23.c	20 Nov 2002 19:45:07 -0000

 	inode->i_ctime = dir->i_ctime;
 	mark_inode_dirty(inode);

 jffs_remove_end:
 	return result;
Can the JFFS guys verify that this doesn't cause a memory leak?
