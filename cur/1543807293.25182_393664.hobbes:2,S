That's an almost-equivalent transformation.  If the compiler's good enough,
it'll generate the same code here I think.
If so then there's probably not much point in optimising it - but one needs
to look at the numbers.

I'm saying "gee, that looks big.  Do you have time to investigate possible
improvements?"   They may come to naught.

Neato.  Please also have a think about __cache_alloc(), see if we can
improve it further - that's a real hotspot.
