I'd be happy to turn this into CONFIG_NONSTANDARD or
CONFIG_EXPERT, which is how I described it in the Kconfig help texts:
menuconfig EMBEDDED
        bool "Configure standard kernel features (for small systems)"
        help
          This option allows certain base kernel options and settings
          to be disabled or tweaked. This is for specialized
          environments which can tolerate a "non-standard" kernel.
          Only use this if you really know what you are doing.
A number of current users are indeed bogus. Stuff like:
config SUPERH
        bool
        default y
        select EMBEDDED
Just because you're using a SuperH board doesn't mean you want to turn
off standard features.
