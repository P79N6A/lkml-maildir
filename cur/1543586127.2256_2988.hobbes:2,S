This seems to me to really be the kind of thing devfs does better than
trying to play number games.  devfs (and I'm talking in the abstract, not
necessarily the existing implementation) can present things in multiple
views, using hard links.  This is a Good Thing, because it lets you ask
different questions and get appropriate answers (one question is "what
are my disks", another is "what are my SCSI devices".)
As far as IDE is concerned, I repeat my call for "generic ATAPI" to go
along with "generic SCSI"...
