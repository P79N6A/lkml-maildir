I cannot start PCMCIA on x86-64 SuSE 9.3 on Asus L5D.  Apparently, the following
command:
sh -c modprobe --ignore-install firmware_class; echo 30 > /sys/class/firmware/timeout
loops forever with almost 100% of the time spent in the kernel.
AFAICS, 2.6.13-rc6-mm2 is also affected, but the mainline kernels are not.
Greetings,
Rafael
