Just wanted to report that these patches lead to progress on my T41p;
relevant lspci -vvv:
0000:01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc M10 NT [FireGL Mobility T2] (rev 80) (prog-if 00 [VGA])

In 2.6.13-rc7 or 2.6.13-rc6-mm2, after echo mem > /sys/power/state, the
lcd light comes back, but no video is actually displayed (I just notice
that the backlight turns on). With your patches, I now see (with either
rc7 or rc6-mm2) a mostly black screen with "inux" in the upper left --
basically a garbled console -- which slowly turns completely white.
If you would like me to do more debugging, I would be more than happy to
do so.
Thanks for the work so far,
Nish
