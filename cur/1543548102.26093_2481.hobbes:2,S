You do not even need patches for it. You can do it as well with a TBF
filter in the qdisc and a u32 filter that selects RSTs (it is even a 
standard example in iproute2) 
Another way that may work is to set the send buffer of tcp_socket in
tcp_ipv4.c to a really small value, so that only one RST packet fits.
Then you get a good load limit implicitely in the stack
(there should be probably a sysctl for that)
