I tell you my honest hunch - remove LVM and try again. This has made
my life a little more peaceful lately. Even with a 2-3 minute outages
while our cluster automatically fails over - the 100's of users whining
about their sessions being disconnected makes you a bit depressed.

We had the black screen also until we got the machines oopsing over
serial. The oops was actually showing up in ext3 with a corrupted
bufferhead. Without LVM, i've measured my longest uptime, 17 days x
4 machines in the cluster (68 days) ie. we only did it 17 days ago.
