Mar 17 21:32:38 lunar pppd[2294]: Hangup (SIGHUP)
Mar 17 21:32:38 lunar pppd[2294]: ioctl(PPPIOCSASYNCMAP): No such file or
directory(5)
Mar 17 21:32:40 lunar pppd[2294]: Exit.
Any ideas what could be causing this?? my asyncmap is set to 0x00000000
I never had this problem with ppp-2.3.5.  Just as this happens it shuts
down the pppd even when its running in demand mode.
