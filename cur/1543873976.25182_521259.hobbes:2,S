No damn it! He's pointing out that you do have heuristics, they are just 
built into the design. And of course he's whipping up test cases, how 
else can anyone help you find corner cases where it behaves in an 
unexpected or undesirable manner?
I think he's trying to help, please stop taking it personally.

Actually I think Ingo has tried to help get it in, that's his patch 
offered for CONFIG_SCHED_FAIR, lets people try it and all.
Now for something constructive... by any chance is Mike running KDE 
instead of GNOME? I only had a short time to play because I had to look 
at another problem in 2.6.21-rc3 (nbd not working), so the test machine 
is in use. But it looked as if behavior was not as smooth with KDE. May 
that thought be useful.
