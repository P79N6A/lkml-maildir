   NFSv2's requirements are stricter -- so I guess knfsd has to handle
   this by locking the inode during an NFSv2 write.  Is this done and
   does anyone care?
   I don't see any similar wording in NFSv3 (rfc1813).
The writes are atomic at the page level, but no further.
When a write through the page cache occurs, pages are locked
while they are being updated, then the lock is released.
Essentially, if you take a gander at mm/filemap.c you'll see that the
bare-bones top-level algorithm of generic_file_write is:
     for_each_page() {
		page = find_page(...);
		if (!page)
			page = make_page_cache_entry();
		/* One of the two above incremented the
		 * page reference count and also locked
		 * the page.
		 */
		write_one_page();
		unlock(page);
		page_cache_release(page);
     }
So the answer is that we provide page-level atomicity at
the moment.  And it's not just an SMP problem actually,
multiple threads of control can write to independant pages
at the "same time" even on uniprocessor.
