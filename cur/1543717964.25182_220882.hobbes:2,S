I think Steven's machine (according to an earlier 'dmesg') has something 
like 384MB of RAM and just one PIII-450 CPU.
With that setup, he's likely getting a lot of IO (and possibly even
swapping). The BK disk working set for the kernel archive is something
like half a gig per tree, I think.
In contrast, your nicer machine will do the whole stress-test basically
totally cached (well, BK will force writeback with fsync, but it will all
be pretty synchronous with nothing else going on).
So if it's IO-related or happens when swapping...
But again, neither of those should usually cause that kind of strange 
partial-page corruption.
