esp0: IRQ 36 SCSI ID 7 Clk 25MHz CCF=5 TOut 167 NCR53C9x(esp236)

My 4m/690 has two esp cards and the disks work hard but I don't see this
problem. Do you have any other non-ross CPUs to try and isolate the problem?

If Sun wasn't so anal and actually helped us out a bit then we concentrate

hardware to work on.
