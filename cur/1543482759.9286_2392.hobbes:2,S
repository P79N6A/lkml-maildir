Yes. The bug Ingo found _is_ a show-stopper. But if you actually read my
email, you would have seen the "unless there is a showstopper" caveat. It
seems we will make a 2.2.1 within days, but it's only going to contain
those kinds of fixes.
That doesn't change the basic issue - I'm _not_ interested in anything
_but_ showstoppers at this point, and I won't be for a few more weeks.
