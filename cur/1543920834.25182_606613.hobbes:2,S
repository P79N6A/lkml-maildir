I've "upgraded" the other machine ("b"), it uses the same VT6307
(not sure the packaging letter but I've already closed the case)
and is made in 2006 (week 22 or 20).
firewire_ohci: Added fw-ohci device 0000:02:03.0, OHCI version 1.10
firewire_core: created new fw device fw0 (0 config rom retries)
firewire_core: created new fw device fw1 (0 config rom retries)
firewire_core: phy config: card 0, new root=ffc1, gap_count=5
Just watching live DV stream across Ethernet from this machine.
OTOH, it's no magic - they claim OHCI 1.1 and they do it. We don't
only know how to enable it with (only) software. I suspect all those
VT6306 could be "upgraded" as well.
