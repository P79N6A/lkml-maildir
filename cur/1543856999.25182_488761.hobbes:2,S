a WARN_ON() also triggers a stack dump, which should pinpoint the exact 
location. (especially if combined with kallsyms) For example:
posix_cpu_timer/13[CPU#1]: BUG in trace_stop_sched_switched at kernel/latency_trace.c:2142
Call Trace:
 [<ffffffff8020b272>] dump_trace+0xaf/0x3f4
 [<ffffffff8020b5f6>] show_trace+0x3f/0x5d
 [<ffffffff8020b8c1>] dump_stack+0x1a/0x1c

 [<ffffffff8020a938>] child_rip+0xa/0x12
here the "trace_stop_sched_switched+0xad/0x30a" is a perfect 
identification of the WARN_ON() code location - if there's any doubt 
about why the problem happened.

side-effects happen regularly in WARN_ON()s and while they should be 
avoided, they are not noticed by the compiler and can cause nasty bugs 
if executed twice. Do we really need this change?
