EHLO developers.of.the.linux.kernel.and.all.others:  :)
I've been using Linux for about 3 years now, and I've yet to see this feature.
Perhaps I'm just silly and haven't looked hard enough, but anyhow..
I was kind've thinking about how nice it would be to have the ability to
reverse stereo channels.  This could be a compile-in option, a module/module
option, or something like that, but personally, I'd like to see it as a sysctl
option.
This may seem like a semi-stupid feature, but..
1) Windows can do it
2) In a presentation, you'd like the stereo sounds to match the directions of
the animations on the screen.  (When Linux has something like Powerpoint..
uNF)
3) Sometimes swapping speakers is not an applicable solution.
Comments/Flames/Reality checks?  Please share.
