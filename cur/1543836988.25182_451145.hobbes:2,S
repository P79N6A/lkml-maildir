Ok, I must be confused then. I though CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START was
introduced in order to allow an alternative address to be provided for
kdump, and that previously it was hard-coded to some
architecture-specific value.
What I was really getting as is if it needs to be configurable at
compile time or not. Obviously there needs to be some sane default
regardless.
