	Read the documentation for _exit. You will see that it is useless in the
case of a portable program that needs to terminate as quickly as possible
and, in fact, isn't guaranteed to cause program termination at all:
       The function _exit is like exit(), but does not  call  any
       functions  registered with the ANSI C atexit function, nor
       any registered signal handlers. Whether it  flushes  stan-
       dard  I/O buffers and removes temporary files created with
       tmpfile(3)  is  implementation-dependent.   On  the  other
       hand, _exit does close open file descriptors, and this may
       cause an unknown delay, waiting for pending output to fin-
       ish.  If  the delay is undesired, it may be useful to call
       functions like tcflush() before calling _exit().   Whether
       any pending I/O is cancelled, and which pending I/O may be
       cancelled upon _exit(), is implementation-dependent.
	One major problem with _exit() is that it touches various structures. If
the program's execution environment is no longer trusted, calling _exit()
can cause an endless loop. In multithreaded programs, _exit() may need to
acquire mutexes. This can take an indeterminate amount of time. Portable
programs cannot rely on _exit() in a case where they need to terminate as
soon as possible.
	Now, if you have a better way for a portable program that needs to
terminate immediately to do so, that's fine, tell me what it is. Otherwise,
you are *forcing* people to DoS your syslog.
