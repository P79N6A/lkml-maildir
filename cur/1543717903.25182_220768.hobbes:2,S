Ho hum.  Greg, any preferences?  We can either:
a) Add a `restart' driver method and call that during reboot instead of
   ->shutdown, if the driver implements ->restart.  Otherwise call
   ->shutdown or
b) stick with the
	if (system_state == SYSTEM_RESTART)
		...
   thing in IDE and potentially a couple of other places?
