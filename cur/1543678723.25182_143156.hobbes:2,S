I know the problem exists in 2.95.3 since that's the one I
used for my initial 2.5.73 testing. Having seen the spinlock.h
patch, I strongly suspected things would break.
If I remember correctly, the empty struct miscompilation exists
in all old egcs and gcc-2.95 versions, but was fixed during 3.0
development, so 2.96 is apparently also Ok.
