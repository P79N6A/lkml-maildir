   What is wrong with using typeof?
Users don't think about the type that way, the new macros forces them
to at least consider it for a moment.
   If you must have a three argument min, 
   could it please be called "type_min" of similar.
We wanted people trying to use "min" and "max" with 2
args, or redefining their own, to get a compile error.
Later,
