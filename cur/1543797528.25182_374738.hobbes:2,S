  I think that the comments of debugfs_create_u16 and
debugfs_create_u32 
have the copy and paste error.
below is original comments.
/**
 * debugfs_create_u16 - create a file in the debugfs
filesystem that is used to read and write a unsigned 8
bit value.
 *
/**
 * debugfs_create_u32 - create a file in the debugfs
filesystem that is used to read and write a unsigned 8
bit value.
 *
It should be "a unsigned 16 bit value" and "a unsigned
32 bit value"
