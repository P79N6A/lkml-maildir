Machine will panic. I've actually captured some and sent them to this
list, but I've been told that my stack was corrupt. Problem is, ATM, I
can't find a memory problem. Memtest86 locks up on test 4(as in, machine
needs hard booting), no matter if it's 8GB or 4GB RAM installed. An no
matter if *known good* ram is being tested as well. So I don't think
it's that per se.

Could that yield a corrupt stack?

I shall gather the information sometime 12/06/2002. TIA
