Hi all.
I know that 2.0-series linux kernel is about to be "dead", now with 2.2
-series. But something strange I have found in 2.0.36 (maybe 2.0.37 you can
fix this):
When I enable Proccess Assounting, in 1.3.78 (with Patch), 2.0.36 (option
in menuconfig) and 2.2.0-pre5-ac1 (option in menuconfig), using the same
accton and dumpacct (compiled on 2.0.36) binaries, the results I got is
strange... In 1.3, works fine; 2.2 also... but 2.0 is a mess! I can't
understand what kind of info it tries to print...
Is there some special instruction i need to do? But... this fact of work in
1.3 and 2.2, but not in 2.0 is getting me down...
Thanks in advance... And sorry if this is my fault.
