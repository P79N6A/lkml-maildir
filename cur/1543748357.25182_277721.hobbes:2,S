Chris,
Thanks for your detailed review, I will work through your 
comments later. I will make the code look better.
Do you have any major concern about the overall design of jobfs?
Do you find any major flaw or big no no where you read the code?
For example, using existing procfs other than creating a new virtual
filesystem. It seems that people are moving things out of /proc, not
adding more, also procfs does not provide mkdir/chown operations, 
that are the reasons I chose a custom fs over procfs.
Another question is where do we mount the jobfs. The mount point does 
not show up in the kernel code, but what are the choices, /job, 
/dev/job, or other places? Is there any guideline about this?
Thanks!
