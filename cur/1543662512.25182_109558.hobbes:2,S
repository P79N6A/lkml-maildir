This was just writing out a single 400 megabyte file with `dd'.  I didn't try
anything fancier.

I have not tried pushing NFS with complex access patterns recently.
BTW, there's a little patch in there from Trond which I forgot to mention: it
implements sendfile for NFS, so loop-on-NFS works again.
But we have a refcounting bug somewhere:
# mount server:/dir /mnt/point
# losetup /dev/loop0 /mnt/point/file
# mount /dev/loop0 /mnt/loop0
# umount /mnt/loop0
# losetup -d /dev/loop0 
# umount /mnt/point
umount: /mnt/point: device is busy
