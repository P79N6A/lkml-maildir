I don't think so. There is a README that should explain this and the
example hotplug-script should go away, because it confuses more than it
helps. The current one looks very different and is working fine for 2.4
and 2.6. If people don't have a firmware.agent script on their system
they can either update the hotplug utils or use the Internet to find
one.
