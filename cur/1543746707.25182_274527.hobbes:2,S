then make it task-C, which tried to take the lock before the RT task
came into the picture. Btw., the above scenario can still happen on SMP.
when task-A unlocks lock1, it can very well give it to task-C - there's
no reason not to do it, task-RT has not expressed any interest in lock1 
yet.
so my example and analysis still stands.

it can produce such a flow on SMP, or if you add in a third non-RT task
(task-C). Agreed?
In the test where you got 3 msecs you had more than 2 non-RT tasks,
correct?
