And that's what some devices do. Apologies for a non-USB example, but
since we are talking about input devices and it would be nice to have
the rules consistent across all hardware interfaces I think it's OK...
Synaptics PS/2 touchpad can be put into a sleep mode where it only
reacts on button presses. While this behavior is reasonable for system-
wide suspend it would hardly work for autosuspend.
