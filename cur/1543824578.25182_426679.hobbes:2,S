Hi,

We have seen > 20% improvement on ppc64 running some networking
workloads when forcing 128 byte alignment (instead of 16 byte
alignment). DMA writes have to get cacheline aligned (in power of 2
steps) on some IO chips.

Im thinking more generally, MTRRs are x86 specific and it would be good
to have a more generic way to enable write combining.
