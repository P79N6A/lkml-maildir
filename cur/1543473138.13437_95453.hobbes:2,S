What I understand is that the second CPU will wait in synchronize_bh() 
(wait_on_bh())  because it will think that there's a bh running on the
first CPU while the first CPU is simply running in a bh_atomic section of
code. This is the reason I changed synchronize_bh, to handle also the case
in which one CPU is running disable_bh in a irq handler... (and because I
can' t understand why we can't run wait_on_bh from an irq handler..).
I agree that a spinlock would work too but using start_bh_atomic() will
automagically protect us also in run_bottom_halves when we'll read
bh_mask and I think that could perform better...
Maybe I am misunderstooding some bit of code...
