They will be affected. In our first implemetentation of 
general "cpu_down after freeze"(
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/2/14/107
)
we had a new state known CPU_DEAD_KILL_THREADS, 
the notifications for which were being sent
*after* we thawed the processes in __cpu_down.
However, in the version which we are working on, we are thawing processes
individually in CPU_DEAD before cleaning/stopping them.
I haven't observed any bad lockups/freeze chills with this approach. 
But I need to test it a bit more before posting them.

gautham.
