OK. *AFAIK* most drivers that use DMA request the memory allocation with
GFP_DMA so that the allocators (whatever they chose) will give them
DMAbale memory from the DMA memory zone. Memory from that zone is fixed
(not pagable). You can then map that memory into proccesses address
space according to demand (and the Linux device drivers second addition
has a good example of doing that).
Now, if I understood you correctly you want to allocate 256M of memroy
and perform DMA into it? if so, you *cannot* use memory allocated using
vmalloc because the memory it supplies is virtual, that is it not
contigous in physical memory but might be scattered all over the place
and I doubt that whatever device you're DMAing from can handle that.
Also, I think you don't want this memory to be swapable, because if it
is swapped out and then in and might very well end up on a completly
different address in physical memory from where it were and again, I
don't think the device that does DMA will be able to handle that - all
the ones I know require physical addresses (well actualy bus addresses
but for the sake of argument let's ignore that for a second).
In short, I don't think you need what you think want... :-)

AFAIK the VM_RESERVED flag will cause kswapd to ignore the page
completly - no paging in or out at all.

See my previous answer regarding why you don't vmalloced memory at
visibility.

Very simple - you can't unload the device until the ref count says all
the users (proccesses in thuis case) have closed it.
