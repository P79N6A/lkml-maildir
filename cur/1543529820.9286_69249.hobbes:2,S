lol :o)
The difference is: your ft script belongs to the distros, reiserfs to the
kernel. Ask some distros to include your script, maybe it is considered
useful. ;o) (Maybe reiserfs also belongs to distros, not to the kernel, but I
thought that we do not really want to go this way (and break linux into
distro-specific linux like latin into italian, french, spanish...) But maybe
I'm wrong...)

I wonder, too, if somebody feels offended, please feel being apologized,
too... (Or please tell me what's the reality, I just quoted the local media
viewpoint to have an example..)

I do not get that point (maybe I'm to tired). Is the user asked "reiserfs"
within "make menuconfig" after freshly installing a current kernel? Until the
answer to this question is "no", users have only the chance, but not the
choice...
