It turns out that the autoconfigure script included in CML2 is actually
an adaptation of kautoconfigure (Giacomo Catenazzi <cate@debian.org>,
http://sf.net/projects/kautoconfigure
), just tweaked to use CML2 and
python... a slightly older version that uses sh (well, bash) is still
available. The ruleset is something like 8 months old by now, but the
features provided are really pretty nifty. I used it once and it worked
very nicely. I don't know if it was the, erm, downfall of CML2 that
killed this project, but I wouldn't mind seeing it come back.
