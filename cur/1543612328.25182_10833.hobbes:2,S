Actually, I think all GCCs will error on it, or at least should.
Most of the __devexit routines are static, you get something like:
test.c:2: weak declaration of `foo' must be public
It is very weird thing to have a non-public weak, and assemblers will do
weird things if you tweak it in assembly output.
