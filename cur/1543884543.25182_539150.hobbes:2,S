Yep.  Although unfortunately given where we are in distro release
cycles (and I'm not sure where glibc is in its release cycle), it'll
probably be a year or so before most users will see the benefits.  So
it would be nice if we can get samba using the fallocate() support
now, in the hopes that we can get all of the pieces aligned in time
for the next major enterprise distro releases.
