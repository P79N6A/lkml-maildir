How about you go read Einstein's history and show me where he made
discoveries by retracing paths which had been shown time and again to
be fruitless?  You'll look for quite a while.
Great leaps forward typically come from a fresh approach, not from 
retrying the same tired out ideas which have failed in the past.
On the other hand, as an old boss pointed out to me once, "don't worry
about the people wasting their time doing it wrong, it keeps them out of
your way".  So maybe I should just bow out of this part of the discussion.
