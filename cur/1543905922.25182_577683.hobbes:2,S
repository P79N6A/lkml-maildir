Doesn't this only take effect if you've been poking /sys/power/pm_trace though ?
Also, look at the date in the output from Chuck. It looks like only the
year is wrong.  I'd have expected more than just the century byte to have been
corrupted.
That +100 heuristic seems really odd to me.  Possibly it needs to be
checking if the century byte is set/unset, or it needs additional
clamping to make sure it doesn't overflow.
