Test with trees of devices too - where a whole tree is suspended -
I don't think you can allocate anywhere in dm_swap_table()
without PF_MEMALLOC (which I recently removed and am reluctant
to reinstate).
Have you considered if anything is feasible based around bd_claim()?
Doesn't it make more sense for the links to be set up at table
load time - i.e. superset of both tables if present?
