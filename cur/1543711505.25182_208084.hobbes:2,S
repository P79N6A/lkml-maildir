The journaled filesystems need this.  We need to make sure that before
we write the commit block for a transaction, all the previous log blocks
we're written are safely on media.  Then we also need to make sure the
commit block is on media.  
We end up with a log blocks, pre-flush, commit block, post-flush cycle,
which is what gives the proper transaction ordering on disk.
For data blocks we only need the post flush, which is why Jens made
blkdev_issue_flush skip the pre-flush.
