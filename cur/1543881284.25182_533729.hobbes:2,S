This is interesting.  Ginormous speedups in ebizzy[1] on my quad core
test system.  The following numbers are the average of 10 runs, since
ebizzy shows some variability.
You can see a big influence from the tlb batching and from Nick's
madv_sem patch.  The reduction in system time from 100 seconds to
3 seconds is way more than I had expected, but I'm not complaining.
The 4 fold reduction in wall clock time is a nice bonus.
According to Val, ebizzy shows the weaknesses of Linux with a real
workload, so this could be a useful result.
