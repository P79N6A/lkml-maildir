Are you a troll?
This is not something to be quoted by anybody serious.
Andrew referred to "well-known weaknesses" in cryptoloop,
and when I inquired it turned out that what he referred to
were properties of cryptoloop and dm-crypt alike, so that
his remarks that started that discussion were misguided.
Of course people may prefer dm-crypt or cryptoloop or loop-aes,
just like people prefer ide-cd or ide-scsi.
I have not yet seen a valid reason to deprecate one of these three
very soon.
