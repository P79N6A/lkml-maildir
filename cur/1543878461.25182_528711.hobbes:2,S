Subject: [PATCH 2/8] Add container pointer on struct page
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/9/82

Each page is supposed to have an owner - the container
that touched the page first. The owner stays alive during
the page lifetime even if the task that touched the page
dies or moves to another container.
This ownership is the forerunner for the "fair" page sharing
accounting, in which page has as may owners as it is really
used by.
