If I'm FUDding then please explain how C++ support modular programming.
How I'm could use module without including part of module sources in my
program ? What's analog of "FROM ... IMPORT ...;" construct from good old
Modula-2 ? Or "with ...; use ...;" from Ada ? Or even "Uses ...;" from
Turbo/Borland/Object Pascal ? Not to mention Java with it's import clause...
No, this is not FUD. This is just bitter truth :-(( Since my daily work is
programming on C++ I'm know this very well...
To say that C++ (or C for that matter) has support for modular programming is
to say that Asm has exellent support for modular programming: you have wonderful
support for modular programming in both languages via include construct...
