I'm having alot of problems with screen and /dev/pts/* as well. In 
my case, I've got /dev/pts mounted to mode 620. Now from what I've observed,
in my case, screen tries to :
crw-------   1 root     tty      136,  13 May 18 10:54 /dev/pts/13
it does a geteuid (root's pid) and getuid (my pid) and then it does a 
setreuid(root's pid, my pid) which results in
open(pty, O_RDWR)... Permission denied
And then it restores the ruid to root and euid to me. Which is obviously
wrong.
Whatever.
