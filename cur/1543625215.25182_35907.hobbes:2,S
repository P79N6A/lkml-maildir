I'm chasing a leak or two somewhere. One common theme seems to be KDE so
my guess is there is something like an mprotect/mremap/shared page path that
isnt correctly accounted and kde triggers more than most other stuff (eg
because of the strange way KDE execs new processes). 
Last night I added some validator code for the non shmfs cases to see if
I can find it.
