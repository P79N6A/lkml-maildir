Ok,
After Ingo forwarded me his original patch (I found his patch via a web
based medium, which had converted all of the left shifts to compares, and
now I'm very glad it didn't boot...) and the system is booted and is
balancing most of the interrupts at least.  Here's the current output
of /proc/interrupts
brynhild:bash$ cat /proc/interrupts 
           CPU0       CPU1       
  0:     171414          0    IO-APIC-edge  timer
  1:          3          2    IO-APIC-edge  keyboard
  2:          0          0          XT-PIC  cascade
  8:          1          0    IO-APIC-edge  rtc
 18:          8          7   IO-APIC-level  aic7xxx
 19:      13566      12799   IO-APIC-level  eth0

 21:          9          7   IO-APIC-level  aic7xxx

So, the timer isn't being balanced still, others are (is there a
specific case in your patch for irq 0 (< 1)?  I couldn't see it but
it almost looks as though it's being missed..)
Thanks to all that replied.
Regards
James
