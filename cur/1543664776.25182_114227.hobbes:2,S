Subject: 2.5.63: Can't handle class_mask in drivers/serial/8250_pci

Compiling 2.5.63 with PCI enabled and SERIAL_8250 as a module
generates these warnings from scripts/file2alias:do_pci_entry(),
via scripts/modpost:
*** Warning: Can't handle class_mask in drivers/serial/8250_pci:0001
*** Warning: Can't handle class_mask in drivers/serial/8250_pci:0002
*** Warning: Can't handle class_mask in drivers/serial/8250_pci:0004
*** Warning: Can't handle class_mask in drivers/serial/8250_pci:0008
*** Warning: Can't handle class_mask in drivers/serial/8250_pci:FFFF00
*** Warning: Can't handle class_mask in drivers/serial/8250_pci:FFFF00
*** Warning: Can't handle class_mask in drivers/serial/8250_pci:FFFF00
Non-fatal, but something's obviously not right.
Who maintains drivers/serial/, Theodore Ts'o or Russell King?
