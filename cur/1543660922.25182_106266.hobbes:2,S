You are running vanilla 2.4.21pre3, right? 
I just noticed that my big update which has this all fixed went 
only in after pre3. Get one of the bitkeeper snapshots from Marcelo
or alternatively if you want the latest'n'greatest check out an 
CVS tree from cvs.x86-64.org (www.x86-64.org has instructions)
