My change seems safe to me because once you have the buffer clean
ll_rw_block will become harmless.
So you only need to check for a just started ll_rw_block and you'll be
done. If an ll_rw_block is not started yet then it will be harmless when
it will happens.
Both the lock bit and the dirty bit are always touched with atomic
operations except in wait_on_buffer() where it's a read.
Talking about the b_sate reads (__buffer_state()), IMO it would be safer
to change __buffer_state to use test_bit to avoid the compiler to cache
the b_state variable in registers (b_state is not volatile).
