    And Linux is the best thing that ever happend to GNU.
It was certainly a very good thing--it filled the last gap in the
system.  100% of an operating system is a lot more useful than 95%.
    Would you be happy if it were called Linux/GNU, for example?
It's appropriate to put GNU first since it came first, but that's a
secondary question so I won't argue about it.  "Linux/GNU" gives us
equal mention, and that is a lot better than just "Linux".  Thank you
in advance if you do that.
