My appologies, I thought you meant do_mounts.c was being yanked
entirly if initramfs goes in.

Actually it's very possible to eliminate it....require an initramfs image
to have scripts and tools (mount and pivotroot) to do it all and mount that
as the root. (An interesting but pretty bad idea IMO) This is what I thought
you meant.

I'll accept your apology after you see how nicely I cleaned up do_mounts.c
(It's 11K now) However I did not know the 'rootfs' was called 'early 
userspace'. (Or was my above assumption correct?)

Jeff, be nice. I'm trying very hard myself...and if you knew me, you'd know
it's a difficult task. : >
