Subject: [PATCH] fix weird placement of static keyword in sound/core/pcm_memory.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/11/23/315

This patch moves the 'static' keyword to the beginning of the declaration 
to eliminate the following warning when building with gcc -W
sound/core/pcm_memory.c:40: warning: `static' is not at beginning of declaration
This has no actal imact on the code, but it's one less warning to sift 
through when looking for potential trouble-code with -W
I have a hard time thinking of a reason to not apply this trivial patch :)
