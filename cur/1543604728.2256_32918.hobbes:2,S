On my velo, I have pcmcia but don't quite know how to drive it properly.
I have not figured interrupts, so I ran ne2000 in polling mode. .5MB/sec
is not bad for as slow hardware as velo is (see sig). Next experiment was
ATA flash. I had to bump HZ to 1000 for it, and I'm getting spurious 
unexpected interrupt messaegs, but it works surprisingly well.
