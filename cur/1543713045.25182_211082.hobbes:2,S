Hi all!
After three weeks of development, we proudly present Umbrella version
0.3 for Linux 2.6.x kernels.
--- Short version ---
Umbrella for implements a combination of process based mandatory access
control (MAC) and authentication of files for Linux on top of the Linux
Security Modules framework. The MAC scheme is enforced by a set of
restrictions for each process.
--- What's new? ---
This release rounds up the implementation of process based restrictions.
To increase performance and to make the use of Umbrella even smoother
for programmers, restrictions have been devided into two levels.
Level 1 is a static set of restrictions, which is provided by The
Umbrella Team. At present these is aimed at protecting a Linux system on
a HP iPAQ. Level 2 is restrictions is purely defined by the programmer
and applies only to the process and sub-processes that the restricted
program spawns.
A short simple example of the use of this may be found in the user space
program in the Umbrella 0.3 release or directly in cvs at:
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/
*checkout*/umbrella/umbrella-devel/userspace/src/umb_user.c?rev=1.3
Furthermore a hash table is implemented to increase flexibility and
speed of the lookup of restrictions.
More details is given on the Umbrella web site:
http://umbrella.sourceforge.net
and on the project site
