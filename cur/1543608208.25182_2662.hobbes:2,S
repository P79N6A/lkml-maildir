There is some race somewhere - I've found one interrupt race (that
actually seems to exist in the 2.2.x VM too, but is probably _much_
harder to trigger where an interrupt at _just_ the right time will
corrupt the per-process local page list.  That looks so unlikely that I
doubt that is it, but I'm looking for others (the irq one wasn't even a
SMP race - it's on UP too, surprise surprise). 
Working on it, in other words.
