The lock module interface has been left identical to that in GFS1 for
the time being so that it is possible to share lock modules between the
two versions. There are a few things which could be tidied up if we were
to change the interface, and we may well do that, but we've been holding
off as long as possible if only to make testing easier.
Since you've brought the subject up, we'll add it to out list :-) Thanks
for the suggestions,
Steve.
