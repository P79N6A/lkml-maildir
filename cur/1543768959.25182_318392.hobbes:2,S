Since Jeff brought up $repo/branches/$branch, you may also want
to add that $repo/branches/$branch is used to record the URL of
the remote $branch (the information used to be in a flat file
$repo/remotes, branch name and URL separated by shell $IFS, one
record on each line), and is quite different from those 40-byte
SHA1 plus LF files you see in $repo/refs/*/ directory.
I think it is a reasonable one, I also follow the
$repo/branches/$branch convention Cogito uses, and I would
encorage other Porcelain implementations to follow suit.
