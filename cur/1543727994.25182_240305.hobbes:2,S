Ok, I can live with that.

Well, "no DMA" needs to be part of definition, too, because some
devices (USB) do DMA only if they have nothing to do.

...well, no, if device wants (for example) PCI state, it can call
to_pci_state() function from core. That should avoid code
duplication. OTOH if driver wants to do something more advanced, it
still can be done.

Well, if runtime suspend is the goal, your patch reflects that
complexity.

You are right, I was not reading carefully enough.
Anyway, there's still one problem:
if something like this gets merged, it will immediately break swsusp
because initially no drivers will have "stop" methods.
Passing system state down to drivers and having special "quiesce"
(as discussed in rather long thread) state has advantage of
automagicaly working on drivers that ignore u32 parameter of suspend
callback (and that's most of them). David's patches do not bring us
runtime suspend capabilities, but do not force us to go through all
the drivers, either...
You could perhaps make the code call suspend when no stop callback is
present... That should add a simple migration path... and would
probably work for me.
