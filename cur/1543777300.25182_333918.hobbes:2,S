Yes, the patch 19/19 contains the translation of configuration
interfaces ([x|g|menu]config) and it is only 23 kb. The full version of
unfinished hu.po is 2 MB and the fully translated italian it.po is 3,2
MB. I see Linus doesn't want the huge language files in kernel source.
But what is Linus opinion about this little .po file?
