NT doesn't - I haven't seen any NT system mount filesystems that MS didn't
develop. This does NOT refer to samba - that makes OUR file system look like
THEIRS, and yes it would be good to support NT ACLs in that case.

1. The distributed file system may come from a Linux server - It would then
   be a Good Thing to support any ACLs on the distributed file system
   (NFS/Coda? If NFS then the underlying file system may have ACLs)
2. The outline I provided does not "force" any ACL support. If it isn't
   supported then the value ENOSYS should be returned to indicate
   that it doesn't exist.
I tried to lay out a proposal that doesn't impose any constraints on the
ACL implementation in the kernel. The filesystem layer should make that
determination.
I also didn't mandate an external daemon to perform translation services, but
one could be used. The application library/editor could communicate with
a daemon for translations, that would be up to the library/editor.

Yup. Didn't mean to imply that removable media was any different - but
consider:
	20GB IDE/SCSI removable disk sleds. IF the facility provides for
	secure storage then the ACLs (and MAC labels too) are also secure.
We have labeled removable media here (file migration to 50GB tapes) and in
a secure facility. Labels can still be trusted since users cannot get their
hands on it. 27TB of data cannot all be stored on non-removable disks (at
least not yet).
