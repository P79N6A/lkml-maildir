It's not a private svn tree -- the IBM ehca development is available
to anyone via svn at 
https://openib.org/svn/gen2/trunk/src/linux-kernel/infiniband/hw/ehca

The IB driver stack is still in its early stages, so although I'm
pushing for things to be merged as fast as possible, the unfortunate
fact is that lots of things that people want to use (including the IBM
ehca driver) are not upstream and are not ready to go upstream yet.
But that doesn't mean we should give up on merging them.
Distro politics are just distro politics -- and there will always be
pressure on distros to ship stuff that's not upstream yet.
