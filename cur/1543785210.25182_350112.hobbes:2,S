New performance result are posted on 
http://kernel-perf.sourceforge.net
with latest data collected on kernel 2.6.13-git9.
Kernel-build bench are fairly stable over the last 14 kernel versions
or so.  It was consistently 3-5% better on x86_64 over baseline 2.6.9
kernel.  It showed a lot smaller gain on ia64 though.
Java business benchmark showed very little change in performance on all
kernel versions.
Volanomark took some heavy performance hit during 2.6.12-rc* period, but
come back in 2.6.13 on x86_64 configuration.  Though latest 2.6.13-git9
showed a little bit perf. regression.
Netperf is showing wildly result, especially the 1-byte request/response
component.  Overall, UDP portion Of the netperf are showing nice improvement
over baseline 2.6.9 kernel.
Industry standard transaction processing database workload still suffering
13% performance regression with 2.6.13. (data will be posted in a separate mail)
Take a look at the performance data.  Comments and suggestions are always
welcome and please post them to LKML.
