I had the same problem here with my Epson Stylus Color 600. I did not matter 
whether I sent the output directly to the printer (cat file.txt > /dev/lp0) 
or used cups or lpd. It just stuck in random places. Fiddling with parport 
settings did not change anything.
In debugging the problem I found out that if one attaches an strace to the 
stuck output process (strace -p pid) the output continues. The strace always 
consisted of either write or read calls (can't remember right now, though 
write seems more logical) the first of which after attaching with strace was 
a request for 8192 Bytes which returned short with usually some 100 bytes. 
All folowing calls had the full 8192 requested Bytes as return value.
All of this vanished, when I replaced all occurrences of /dev/lp0 in my 
printer configuration by /dev/par0. I has been working flawlessly since then.
I have changed quite a bit on my system since that time, but using 
/dev/printers/0 under devfs also works fine here.
