When group leader exits it goes into TASK_ZOMBIE state (if it is not the
only one thread in the same group). It is still the ->group_leader for all
threads including itself. Only when release_task(last_thread_in_thread_group)
happens, it will notice not yet released group_leader, and release it, see
'repeat:' patch in release_task().
The ->group_leader is changed only when non-leader thread does exec, it kills
other threads and becomes ->group_leader for itself.
So, I think send_group_sigqueue() should do:
	read_lock(tasklist_lock);
	if (!tsk->signal) {
		// Can happen only if de_thread did release_task(tsk)
		// while switching to new leader.
		// We can't figure out the new leader, but it does not
		// matter - we should drop the signal anyway.
		unlock(tasklist);
		return;
	}
Oleg.
