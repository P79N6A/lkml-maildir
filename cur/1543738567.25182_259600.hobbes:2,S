Hi folks,
I installed 2.6.9-rc4 this morning, but it died at boot time
(a lot of hex output and something about "Aiee" :-). I tried
to redirect syslog to another host, but the error message did
not show up in the foreign log files.
Any idea how to catch this message? The problem seems to be
reproducable, and I would be glad to help.
Regards
Harri
