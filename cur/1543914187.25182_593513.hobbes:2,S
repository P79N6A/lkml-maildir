Yes, it can change while in use. A measure of how quickly it can change
is roughly: it can half in a dirty_limit worth of writeout.
What will happen is that those processes doing heavy IO on the slower
device will get throttled more aggressively until its below its new
threshold again - however all the time it will keep on writing at (full)
speed because it will have this backlog to rid itself of, and by doing
that it completes writeouts which ensure it will keep part of the dirty
limit for itself, and thus can always make progress.
You can monitor this by looking at /sys/block/sd*/queue/cache_size while
doing such a thing. It should stabilise quite 'quickly'.

Uhh, yeah, obviously :-)

Perhaps already answered above, as long as there is dirty stuff to write
out it will keep completing writes and thus gain a stable share of the
dirty limit.
