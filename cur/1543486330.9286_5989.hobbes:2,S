Hi all.
Last night, when i was compiling a new program, i did this thing "in
locus":
darkstar:/usr/src/gs5.50# cd //tmp (double slash?)
darkstar://tmp# cd //usr (works??)
darkstar://usr# _ (how?????)
and it works in any parent directory. If i try:
darkstar://usr# cd //home//ftp//pub
darkstar://home/ftp/pub# _
I just got double slashes in 1st dir. Is that really possible to do, or my
machine (and me) are getting too much crazy? :p
Linux 2.2.1, glibc-2.0.7pre6, egcs-1.1.1, ext2fs to all disks, bash 2.20.
Is "just" a 3.6 slack being migrated to glibc.
