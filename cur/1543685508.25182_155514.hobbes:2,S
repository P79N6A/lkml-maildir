I've got an old system with 2.2.10 and took a look.  It
appears as though the form of the loop in may of 1999 was
	for(delay = SX_CCR_TIMEOUT; delay; delay--)
so my guess is that the changes were made around the
constant to minimise typing and progressed something like so:
	for(delay = SX_CCR_TIMEOUT; delay; delay--)
	for(delay = SX_CCR_TIMEOUT; delay > 0; delay--)
	for(delay = 0; delay < SX_CCR_TIMEOUT > 0; delay++)
with name changes somewhere in the mix.  So there was never
any intent to have a double test.  Besides comparing a
constant with another constant wouldn't make much sense.
