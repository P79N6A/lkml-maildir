If we're compiling the messages into the kernel regardless,
then it doesn't really make much sense to NOT show all of them
on the error paths.
This stuff (fancy status dumps) is mostly just for the error paths,
where more information is always a good thing.
Controlling the rest of the ata_msg_xxx stuff from sysctl is fine
for non-error paths.
Cheers
