 From the diff, I can see the problem is that "__bss_start" changes 
position with "_edata" from the first to the second pass.
If your read my post from yesterday "Re: Linux v2.6.12-rc4" (not a very 
descriptive subject), I explain there why this is a problem.
Sam, from looking at your patch, it seems that the patch shouldn't 
affect these particular symbols. Am I correct?
Maybe we really need the more robust fix to kallsyms, so that this sort 
of thing doesn't bite us in the future, no matter what symbols change 
position.

This is just a "tape over" solution that makes the symbols change 
positions, so that maybe these 2 symbols don't get selected for sampling.

There is a simple workaround that is to increase the WORKING_SET define 
in scripts/kallsyms.c to something like 65536. This will include every 
symbol in the token table calculation, so that even if symbol position 
changes, the token table should be the same.
I tested this with a configuration I have here that had a similar 
problem and it indeed worked as expected.
The problem with this approach is that it takes longer to calculate the 
token table. (~3secs on my P4 2.8GHz, 11300 symbols)
