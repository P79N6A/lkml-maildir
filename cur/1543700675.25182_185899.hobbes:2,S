Well, it's not just for /dev/random but also for all in-kernel cosumers
of random numbers, so doing this as a sysctl makes quite a lot of sense.
Whether sysctl should be mached into procfs or sysfs or rather be it's
own fs is an entirely different question.  Interface-wise the latter
would make most sense.
