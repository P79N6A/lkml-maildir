I've had people pull the authentication game on me before. I just
stopped replying to them, waste of my time.
Fixing the spam problem is a lot easier without losing contact with
all your friends in the proces:, train your Bayesian filters and be
done with it. Mine were a mess, deleted all the data and fed 10 days
of spam and some proper mail through sa-learn. Since then I have seen
1 spam make it through during the last week, it used to be 20-40/day
(and some 200-300/day caught by the filters).
