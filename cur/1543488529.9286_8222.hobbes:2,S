Thank you very much for replying Alan.

Perfect.  I at least glad to hear something :-)  Will going back to
userland nfs help the situation.  That was basically my next step in
things to try.

2.2.0 had the same behavior.  The box was never used with 2.0.36 and the
reason being support for the Adaptec 2940 U2W cards.  At the time, it
seemed at if the U2W was not supported by the driver in 2.0.36.  Was I
wrong?  Plus I fear changes in raid may make things rather difficult to
move back.  This is unfortunately a production level machine.  Downtime to
backup, wipe out the partition and rebuild would well, hurt.

Next time it dies I will do this and get a copy and send it to the list.
Is there any way to anticipate a failure, or something to watch that will
tell me something is wrong?
I appreciate this.
Thanks
