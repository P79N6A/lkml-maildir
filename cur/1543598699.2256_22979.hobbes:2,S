Longstanding Linux Bug: "ignore a _seven_ year old standard called PNPBIOS".

PNPBIOS _easily_ resolves this problem !
Try -ac Kernels with integrated PNPBIOS and "lspnp -v",
then you will see your "motherboard resources". No magic.
Note: Linux currently does _not_ yet reserve these resources automatically
(although I think the standalone pcmcia package has such an option).
By confirming (and posting your lspnp results) you could encourage
some developers to rectify this situation :-)
Alan, 2.4 would largely benefit from PNPBIOS, do you plan
to submit this to LT (probably with the proposed life saver fix) ?
