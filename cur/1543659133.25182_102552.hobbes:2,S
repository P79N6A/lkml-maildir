I wasn't sure how suitable patches would be for documentation but I'll try
anything once. A tar ball of the current tex source is at
http://www.csn.ul.ie/~mel/projects/vm/guide/vm_book.tar.gz
 . There is a
CVS tree but it's on a computer thats already heavily loaded so I don't
want to have it hammered.
The tex sources are in tex/understand and tex/code . To create a DVI,
simply ./make dvi . If you add "understand" or "code", it'll just generate
that book.
