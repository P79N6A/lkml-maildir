no, i'm discussing precisely the point you raised:

with the observation that 1) binding is already possible [so your 
suggestion is apparently knocking on open doors] 2) binding is a 
separate mechanism (not adequate for all workloads) and it is thus 
orthogonal to what i'm trying to achieve with the "RT overload" stuff.  
Really simple and straightforward observations i think.
