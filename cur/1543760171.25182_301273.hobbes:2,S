You know what would be really useful... if www.kernel.org listed the
"latest -ac" patch as something current instead of 2.6.10-ac12, which was
a great patch in its day, but hasn't been current for a while.
In fairness, the -mm is out of date, too. Perhaps a bit of automation
would be appropriate here, so that no one would have to update this
manually.
