I did a procfs-based implementation of a user interface for setting CPU
affinity.  It implements various features like Ingo's with the change
that it is, obviously, a procfs entry and not a set of syscalls. 
It is readable and writable via /proc/<pid>/affinity 
I posted a patch to lkml moments ago, but it is also available at 
	
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rml/cpu-affinity
(please use a mirror).
Comments, suggestions, et cetera welcome -- if possible under the new thread.
