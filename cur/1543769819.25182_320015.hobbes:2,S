I think yes.
Moving a subtree to a different namespace is a bit tricky so maybe
move should still be restricted to be within a single namespace.
And I think we should relax the checks under /proc, to allow proper
access to foreign namespaces as far as it doesn't impact security.
E.g. it makes sense to allow a process to access /proc/self/fd/XXX
even if XXX resides in a different namespace.  Currently that is not
allowed.
