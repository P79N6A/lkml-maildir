I guess a kernel profile would be useful.
- Add "profile=1" to the kernel boot command line
- Run some workload
- In another xterm, do:
	readprofile -r
	sleep 10
	readprofile -n -v -m /boot/System.map | sort -n +2 | tail -40
  (make sure that you're using the correct System.map for the
  currently-running kernel).
