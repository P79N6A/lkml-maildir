I think he needs to pass on much more data than just return address. 
IIUC, he needs to pass backup pages map to new kernel, so that any
user space tool can use backup pages map to reconstruct/rearrange the
first kernel's memory core and tools like makedumpfile can do filtering
before hibernated images is saved.
This brings me to a random thought. Can we break the process of loading
a hibernation kernel in two steps.
- In first step just do the memory reservation for running second kernel.
  (kexec -l <dummpy-file-for-reserving-memory>)
- This memory map of reserved pages is exported to user space.
- Use this memory map and regenerate the hibernation kernel initrd
  (rootfs.gz) and put the memory map there. This memory map can be used
  by makedumpfile in second kernel for filtering.
This way it will user space to user space communication of information 
which gets fixed at kernel loading time.

Agreed. Without a proper protocol, we will often run into issues that
X version of kernel does not work with Y version of hibernation kernel
etc.

That makes sense. Just that we shall have to put some kind of ELF NOTE
or some other identifier in resumable core file to identify it.
