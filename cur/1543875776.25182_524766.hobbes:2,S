That, cryptically enough, means that the filesystem has detected a 
problem and has shut down.

For one reason or another, xfs has detected a corrupted on-disk inode 
format which it cannot recognize, and shuts down.  It is likely the 
result of something which has gone wrong previously.  xfs_repair should 
fix it.  Are there other non-xfs messages in your logs indicating other 
problems prior to this?
