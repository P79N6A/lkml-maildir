Subject: 2.6.16-rc5: process with huge vsize but no swap used

System is a Thinkpad 600X (Pentium III) w/ 576MB of RAM, 1GB of swap.
While testing 2.6.16-rc5 for ACPI issues, I ran across a vm behavior
that I've never seen before.  I had just booted and logged in via xdm,
and had opened a few small files in emacs.  All of a sudden
sudden emacs complained that:
  Memory exhausted--use M-x save-some-buffers RET
I didn't have any large files opened, but:
$ ps u3817
USER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
sanjoy    3817  0.1  2.0 1246160 11992 ?       S    Mar09   0:11 emacs -iconic
No swap is being used despite emacs allegedly consuming 1.2GB of VM:
$ free
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:        580924     219964     360960          0      29124     128956
-/+ buffers/cache:      61884     519040
Swap:      1068280          0    1068280
Is that possible (maybe it's all zero-filled memory)?  If so, it's an
emacs bug that I've never seen before and I'll report it on the emacs
lists.  If it's not possible, then maybe it's a kernel issue.  I saved
/proc/3817/{maps,smaps,status,exe} just in case.
