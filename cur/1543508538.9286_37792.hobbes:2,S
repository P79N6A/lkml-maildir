Hmm. In that case, you need a 
	evqid = create_event_queue ();
	declare_interest (int evqid, int fd, int interestmask);
Once we start redefining APIs the fun starts:
I just define that the declare_interest pushes a "ready for read" onto
the event queue, if declare_interest is called on an fd that already is
ready-for-read.
I have seen applications that would switch between select with two
distinct different sets.
