`mount` uses _TCP_ (and mountd sits at an address at around 6xx here). So
a mount bug/loop may explain some kind of flood. Dan can be _right_ saying
"it was all me".
Anyway this doesn't seems a 2.0.x security issue but a mount/mountd
userspace problem if something. So I only suggest to upgrade `mount` as
first thing and the nfs server (rpc.mountd mainly) as second thing, and
also the kernel if 2.0.x still doesn't work stable for you.
