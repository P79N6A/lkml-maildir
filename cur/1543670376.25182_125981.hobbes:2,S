I thought I'd read everything about the Rhine and Via in my lurking on
lkml, but I must have missed something.  This box here is an Abit KD7-RAID
(Via KT400 + Rhine II) and I have IOAPIC enabled and am using Roger's latest
driver with 2.4.21-pre6 with great success.

What am I missing here?  It sounds like it's dangerous to use, but it
doesn't look like it's broken.
