For most people, entropy input far exceeds entropy output and the pool
is a finite size. There's no reason not to use these entropy bits as
the pool is always full and we're discarding entropy constantly. It's
only a problem when the pool is running low and we risk making
/dev/random block.

Convenience and control of resource sharing. The latter is slightly
under-implemented.
