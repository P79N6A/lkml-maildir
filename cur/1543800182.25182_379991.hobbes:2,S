I'm glad you agree.  I've decided to try something different once 2.6.16
is out.  Every day, I'm going to push the -git snapshot of the day into
a testing branch for Fedora users. (Normally, only rawhide[1] users 
get to test kernel-de-jour, and this always has the latest userspace, so
we don't notice problems until a kernel point release and the stable
distro gets an update).
It'll come with disclaimers up the whazoo about it possibly crashing,
eating your cat etc, but I bet some loonies will be mad enough to
try it, and report when it crashes and burns. This should at least
get us knowing about *when* we break things sooner.
During 2.6.16rc, expect more screaming.
