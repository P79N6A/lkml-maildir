Not entirely, using a radix tree instead lets you tag things instead of
doing the current backflips across three lists.

This gives you an O(inodes dirty) behavior instead of the current O(old
inodes).  It might not matter, but walking the radix tree is more
expensive than walking a list.
But, I look forward to your patches, we can tune from there.
