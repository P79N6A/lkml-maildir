Hello,
For Mathieu's uses, it's critical to have a short a path as possible in his
instrumentation code since the results can be effected by it as well as general
impact on the kernel.
The reason why the old RCU read-side logic is ok is that in the -rt kernel RCU
is use to protect things like dcache_lock and other large kernel subsystems. A
non-preemptible RCU would otherwise make all locks in the file system with a
RCU critical section above it in the lock graph non-preemptible or else it
violates the locking rules resulting in dead locking. Since Mathieu's NMI code
doesn't take other kernel locks outside of his own code, it won't create a
situation where it forces parts of the -rt system back below an RCU read-side
section to be non-preemptible.
A preempt_disable/enable should be good enough to restore the previous RCU
behavior just for Mathieu's NMI code with maybe a different function for RCU
synchronization. Making RCU safe for NMI isn't really necessary, but I'm sure
it won't stop you (Paul) from trying. :)
