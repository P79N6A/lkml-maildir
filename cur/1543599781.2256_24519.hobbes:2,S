__module_license needs to be static.  Otherwise we get problems when
MODULE_LICENSE() is used in two objects which are linked into the same
module.  Given the legal requirements for copyright etc., I expect
people to put MODULE_LICENSE in every source file, not just one.
What do you need for licence support in modutils?  Obviously modinfo
needs to print it, but what about insmod?  Should insmod issue warning
messages for proprietary modules?  What about ksymoops?  IOW, what was
the reason for adding MODULE_LICENSE?
