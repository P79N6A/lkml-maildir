Quoting Al Viro on this subject on 11/12/99:
It's being changed. Really. Blame me - USB SCSI _is_ broken in .27 and
will remain that way for some time. It did things that were/are illegal
wrt mid-layer SCSI and procfs. I had deliberately left the thing in
non-compiling state - better than screwed memory and, ultimately, screwed
filesystems.
	There is a procfs cleanup underway (Jeff and your truly) and some
things will be broken for a while. Sorry.
			Al, really going down now - 40 hours up and most
of them fscking with SCSI code...
