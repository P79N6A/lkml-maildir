While that has been an interesting idea, its implementation would need
to be sketched out far beyond the speculative, in order to override
what I perceive as the rough consensus reached during earlier in the
thread.

If you don't allow yourself to presume on-the-fly function
recompilation, then these markers would need to be made run-time
rather than compile-time configurable.  That is, not like this:
