	Hello All ,  I have a .config file that has only the needed items
	defined .  What I am looking to do is have the 'make *config'
	be in a script that builds a kernel .  I'd like to have all
	entries that would pop up in a 'make oldconfig' as undefined
	be defined as 'N' .  I am not looking for this to cross major
	kernel versions (ie: 2.4 -> 2.5) just to many possible changes in
	the code .  Does anyone have any pointers ?  Tia ,  JimL
