If my aunt lives in Rome but I get a postcard (or even a letter) from
her in Moscow, are you suggesting I should consign it to the dustbin
unread? That's what the SPF folks seem to want, and it works no better
in your snail mail analogy than it does in real life.
People travel. Mail gets forwarded.

In the case of mail from my bank, if it _had_ a postmark rather than
being pre-paid I would be suspicious.
The SPF folks would have me refuse mail from claiming to be from the
bank because it's actually delivered by my postman, and he doesn't work
for the bank therefore it must be a "forgery" (using their new
definition of that term).
Meanwhile, in the real world, I don't want to throw away valid mail. And
there are better ways of avoiding fakes, too. 
ObVger: we should probably enable sender verification callouts, if
they're not being done already. There's no justification for accepting
mail from an address which doesn't accept bounces. That would combat
forgery in a much saner manner.
