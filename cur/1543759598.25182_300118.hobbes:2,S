Having Linus pull from the 2.6.x.y bk tree, will not work out.  We
probably don't want the .1, .2, and so on tags in the tree, as well as
not all fixes in there will be proper for his tree (like the 2 currently
in 2.6.11.1.)  The "real" fix will go into his tree through the proper
ways.
But I/we will be sure to pick out the stuff that should go there and
send them to him.
