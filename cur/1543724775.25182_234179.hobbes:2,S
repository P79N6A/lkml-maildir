There are two flags in adjacent bytes of pci config space.
State transitions are shown in the spec [1] (simple state
diagrams), but basically your hardware started out in a
"BIOS owned" mode, and we want Linux to run it instead.
So we change (0,1) to (1,1), then BIOS should get an IRQ
before changing it to (1,0) and ignoring EHCI ... it's not.
Sounds to me like your BIOS may be broken.  But if you're
up for it, you could try using byte access to write that one
flag byte; I could also believe some hardware won't issue the
SMI interrupt without that.  There are also a lot of bits in
the next word, which might let you stomp on on the BIOS in
constructive useful ways.
