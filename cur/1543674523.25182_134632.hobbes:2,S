Hi,
I'm having problems with epic100 module. The kernel is 2.4.21rc2, SMP.
epic100 module from 2.4.21rc2 kernel, compiled with RH9 "gcc 3.2.2-5"
produces ca 1% of RX frame errors.
epic100 module from 2.4.20rc2 (insmod -f into 2.4.21rc2 kernel) produces
these errors, too.
The same source (2.4.20rc2) compiled with "RH8.0 gcc 3.2-7 20020903" works
fine with insmod -f (and with 2.4.20rc2 SMP kernel as well).
Any idea what's wrong?
I'm working on it, but someone might have fixed it already.
