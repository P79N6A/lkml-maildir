At this point, I'd like direct everyone's attention to the simloads package:
<
http://downloads.sourceforge.net/cpuse/simloads-0.1.1.tar.gz>
which contains a set of programs designed to be used in the construction 
of CPU scheduler tests.  Of particular use is the aspin program which 
can be used to launch tasks with specified sleep/wake characteristics.
