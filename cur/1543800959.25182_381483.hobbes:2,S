Yes, if we uninline a big hunk of stuff, we should see results. But
which hunk? Running benchmarks w/ and w/o Ingo's 3 patches should be
educational. As would with -Os.
Also note that there are going to be cases where smaller wins by
orders of magnitude: where it makes the difference between the working
set fitting in cache or RAM or not.

The out of line spinlock stuff went by about a year ago. Google for
"zwane spinlock out of line".
