} I've thought about this since I have the above (more or less) all over
} my code. The problem is, I could find no good way to do that macro. I
} ended up with something like:
} 
} #define for_each_entry(p,tmp,head,type,member)		\
} for (tmp = (head)->next;				\
}      p = list_entry(tmp,type,member), tmp != (head);	\
}      tmp = tmp->next)
} 
} struct node {
} 	int data;
} 	struct list_head list;
} };
} 
} struct list_head *queue, *tmp;
} struct node *n;
} 
} ...
} 
} for_each_entry(n,tmp,queue,struct node,list)
} 	printf("%d\n", n->data);
} 
} ...but I could never remember what order the fields come in. Or you
} can leave the list_entry call outside, but then the macro doesn't help
} much, just reduces the readability of the code. So no macro for me.
} 
I was thinking something slightly simpler..Like this:
#define FOR_EACH(pos, head) \
        for (pos = (head)->next; pos != (head); pos = pos->next)
So a sample program would be:
#include <stdio.h> 
#include "list.h" 
struct node { 
	int data; 
	struct list_head list; 
}; 
int main(void) 
{ 
	struct list_head queue, *pos;
	struct node n1, n2, n3; 
	n1.data = 1; 
	n2.data = 2; 
	n3.data = 3; 
	INIT_LIST_HEAD(&queue); 
	list_add(&n1.list, &queue); 
	list_add(&n2.list, &queue); 
	list_add(&n3.list, &queue); 
	FOR_EACH(pos, &queue) {
		struct node *n = list_entry(pos, struct node, list); 
		printf("%d\n", n->data); 
	} 
/* Instead of:
        pos = queue.next; 
        while(pos != &queue) { 
                struct node *n = list_entry(pos, struct node, list); 
                printf("%d\n", n->data); 
                pos = pos->next; 
        } 
*/
	list_del(&n2.list); 
	list_del(&n1.list); 
	list_del(&n3.list); 
}
