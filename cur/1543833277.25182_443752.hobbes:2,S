BTW, with smp-alternatives thing merged, "SMP or not" may not be that
simple question anymore.
I for one stopped compiling UP and SMP kernels for x86 since 2.6.17,
because SMP kernel works just fine on UP, including benchmarks (as
opposed to SMP kernel w/o smp-alternatives).  But I don't remember
if uname shows SMP in this case or not (don't have any running UP
machine with that kernel right now).
But the thing is: smp-alternatives + cpu-hotplug changes things at
runtime...
