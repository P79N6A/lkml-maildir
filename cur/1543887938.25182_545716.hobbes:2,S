drivers/gameport/gameport.c as well.
Both read the PIT directly, which will lead to interesting results. The
PIT is either stopped or it can be used in one shot mode with per event
changing intervals due to the changes introduced by the clock events
layer.
This code should use ktime_get() and not fiddle in the hardware itself.
