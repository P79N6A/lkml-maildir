Well, that shows that this particular problem was solved, but there are
more problems. No doubt we'll understand everything eventually.
(Unless we remove this i8042_unxlate_seen before understanding all problems.
It is really very ugly to have two different arrays that both keep the
"key down" status of the keys, and that can get out of sync.)
Again, of course, I would like to see the past few dozen scancodes, like you
gave before, up to the moment the problem arises.
(If you cannot think of something better, just log every incoming scancode.)
