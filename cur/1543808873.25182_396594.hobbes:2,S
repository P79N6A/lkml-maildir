OK, tested scsiinfo now with 9 bridges (8 or 7 different chips).
The patch obviously works as expected.
Jody, are you going to channel the patch through your tree?
BTW, a Prolific based enclosure indeed seems to be unable to handle
CD-ROMs after scsiinfo treatment. An enclosure based on an old
revision of TI StorageLynx apparently causes mode_sense -> check
condition/ unit attention loops when scsiinfo tries to access some
mode page.
