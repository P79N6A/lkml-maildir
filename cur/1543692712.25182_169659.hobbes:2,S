Ouch, ouch and ouch.  You're right, it is a serious problem with the
patch.  It is easy enough to fix by making the fault handler not take
mmap_sem if the fault's in the kernel address range.  (With apologies
to the folk running kernel mode userspace...)

It might deref off the end of a mapped region.

I agree, but there's going to be an installed base of _current_ 2.4
kernels, on these AMD CPUs, for some years to come.  App and library
writers will have to know about the erratum if they want to use the
prefetch instruction, for a while yet.
Btw, does anyone know if the "prefetchw" instruction is affected by
the erratum?  I see that in current 2.6, only the "prefetchnta"
instruction is disabled so presumably "prefetchw" is ok?
