iBurst is a wireless broadband internet service, so far I only know that it is 
available in Austrailer and South Africa. Here in South Africa, there are two 
devices you can use for connectivity an internal and external "modem". With 
the external modem, you can use either  USB or ethernet to connect (pppoe). 
The PCMCIA currently is not documented and there is no driver for Linux.
I ordered the external modem (still waiting for it), I'll try to get some guys 
from our LUG to test it (only the PCMCIA version is causing pain), hopefuly 
someone is stuck with that version ;)
