Diff between 2.4.6pre2aa2 and 2.4.6pre3aa1:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Moved on top of 2.4.6pre3.
Only in 2.4.6pre2aa2: 00_alpha-compile-swapon-1
Only in 2.4.6pre2aa2: 00_x86-entry.S-fix-1
	Merged in 2.4.6pre3.
Only in 2.4.6pre3aa1: 00_backout-gcc-3_0-patch-1
	Backout 2.4.6pre3 gcc 3.0 change.
	(nice to have)
Only in 2.4.6pre3aa1: 00_alpha-warnings-1
	Fix alpha warning from Jeff.
	(nice to have)
Only in 2.4.6pre2aa2: 00_ksoftirqd-5
Only in 2.4.6pre3aa1: 00_ksoftirqd-6
	Replace _NOVERS with %c0.
	(nice to have)
Only in 2.4.6pre2aa2: 00_o_direct-8
Only in 2.4.6pre3aa1: 00_o_direct-9
	Improve truncate_inode_pages and invalidate_inode_pages2.
	This patch triggered a bug in the alpha port where O_DIRECT
	was defined as O_SYNC. O_DIRECTIO of tru64 is defined as ours
	O_NOFOLLOW, so some breakage is going on. To at least allow
	O_SYNC to work on alpha I defined for now O_DIRECT as 02000000
	and we'll possibly change it later.
	(recommended)
Only in 2.4.6pre3aa1: 00_backout-udelay-1
Only in 2.4.6pre3aa1: 10_alpha-udelay-1
	Replace 2.4.6pre3 change with a better fix proposed by me and
	implemented by Jeff.
	(nice to have)
