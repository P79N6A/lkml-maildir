Actually, no, it does not work that way. The wait queue is the mechanism
by which a process can be *woken up* . The call to add_wait_queue() does
not put the process to sleep.
The process is put to sleep in do_poll(), using schedule_timeout() with
the current state as TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE. This is on line 453.
Your driver will eventually have to wake up sleepers on the queue.
do_poll() will also wake up when the timeout expires, or a signal is
sent to the poll()'ing process.
These semantics have not changed since 2.4. The implementation has
changed a bit, but the driver interface has not changed. Read the
documentation the Roland pointed you to.
