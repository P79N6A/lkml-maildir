Subject: strange sync behaviour

Try this on an unloaded system:
sync
find / -name something
sync
ok, now all directories are cached and no buffers have to be written to 
the disk. Type again:
find / -name something
sync
Why the sync command make my HDs to work for 2-3 seconds ?  find 
shouldn't write anything on the disk, so what has it to update ??
Bye.
