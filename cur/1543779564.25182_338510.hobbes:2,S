Doesn't compile for me w/ gcc 3.4.4:
  CC      arch/i386/kernel/irq.o
In file included from include/linux/dyn-tick.h:64,
                 from arch/i386/kernel/irq.c:21:
include/asm/dyn-tick.h: In function `reprogram_apic_timer':
include/asm/dyn-tick.h:48: warning: implicit declaration of function
`apic_write_around'
include/asm/dyn-tick.h:48: error: `APIC_TMICT' undeclared (first use in this
