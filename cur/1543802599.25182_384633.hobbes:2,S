John,
accidentially ;-) I did merge my PPSkit-light into SuSE's 2.6.13 tree. It wasn't a 
big issue to merge the patch, but that might not be sufficient. Originally I 
wanted to update the patch for a standard kernel tree, but I realized that I first 
have to get the sources. I cannot promise you when, but I'll try to apply my stuff 
to a recent 2.6 kernel.
So if there's a kernel source to merge my stuff with, tell me wich, but the source 
should be stable enough to give me time to finish the merge before the next one is 
out. I only have a slower modem at home, so I cannot refresh sources frequently.
Does a release candidate kernel have the nanosecond clock in now? I got that 
impression recently.
BTW: Leaving the old crap in the kernel would help me to merge my stuff (Looking 
for "anchors" in the sources).
Regards,
Ulrich
