The logic is faulty, or at least very odd.
	tx_left = tp->cur_tx - dirty_tx;
	while (tx_left > 0) {
		int entry = dirty_tx % NUM_TX_DESC;
		if (!(le32_to_cpu(tp->TxDescArray[entry].status) & OWNbit)) {
			...
		}
	}
Why is that `if' test there at all?  If it ever returns false, the box
locks up.  A BUG_ON(le32_to_cpu(tp->TxDescArray[entry].status) & OWNbit)
might make more sense.
