Actually I thought that what you needed was an is_valid_gpio();
your motivation was that you needed a predicate.
The problem I have with a #define for a single such invalid GPIO
number is that people will inevitably start to assume it's the
only such number.  In particular "if (gpio == NO_GPIO) ..."
is by definition incorrect.
So I'd really rather see a predicate like is_valid_gpio().
If you want to designate one value for use as an initializer,
then I'd rather see a simple
	#define NO_GPIO	(-EINVAL)
without any option for arch-specific overrides ... along with a
comment that this is only *one* of the numerous values which
will fail is_valid_gpio().
