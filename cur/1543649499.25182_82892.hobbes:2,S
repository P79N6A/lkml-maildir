Great, thanks!
Yes, it's true that the xtkbd.c code has no way to set the LEDs on the
keyboard nor any functions that'd support sending bytes to the keyboard.
Anyway, the PC-9800 seems to have diverged from IBM machines at about
the time of the XT, and thus the keyboard controller in it (i8251) and
the keyboard itself speak much like they'd do on an IBM XT, with some
extensions like adding commands to set the LEDs, of course.
