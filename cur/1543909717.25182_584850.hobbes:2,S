Thanks for the explanation, Andi. I understand it much better now, and 
agree with you.
As alternatives what we have now, we can either keep the paravirt_ops as 
it is now for the native case, just hooking the vsmp functions in place 
of the normal one, (there are just three ops anyway), refill the 
paravirt_ops entirely in somewhere like vsmp.c, or similar (or maybe 
even assigning paravirt_ops.fn = vsmp_fn on the fly, but early enough).
Maybe we could even make VSMP depend on PARAVIRT, to make it sure it is 
completely a paravirt client.
But as you could see, my knowledge of vsmp does not go that far, and I 
would really like to have input from the vsmp guys prior to touch 
anything here.
