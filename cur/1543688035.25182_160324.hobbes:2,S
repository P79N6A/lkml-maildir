precisely what scheme do you mean by this? There are two important points:  
when a thread sleeps on a futex, and when some thread does a wakeup on a
futex address. We cannot hash the futex based on the virtual address
(arbitrary share-ability of futex pages is another key appeal of them),
and if by the time the wakeup happens the physical page goes away how do
we find which threads are queued on this address?
