Well I have the skills to follow LKML discussion, but I don't have the 
skills to provide *perfect* patch for loop.c
So I'm offering a financial reward for the *perfect* loop.c patch.
It should support *A LOT OF* loop devices without any need to specify 
any max_loop at all.
I offered $256 in my previous email, I don't know if this is enough for 
this job, so I'm open to all your suggestions. Is there anyone interested?
If you hate these offers on LKML then let me know please, I'm just used 
to pay for others' time, I hope it doesn't offend you.
Thank you for your consideration.
