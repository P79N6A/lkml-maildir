Meaning that you don't trust the DVD media test to return true on all
drives when and only when there's DVD media currently in there?
If that's your logic, it follows that userspace programs shouldn't
trust the DVD media test either - they should always call
DVD_READ_STRUCT if they would like to treat DVDs differently to CDs.
So, can you add a flag to the request meaning "if this
DVD_READ_STRUCT request fails with illegal request, don't log it"?
