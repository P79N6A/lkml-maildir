Agreed - we've found that we've had roughly 50% success in finding
the cause of these problems from crash dumps triggered immediately
like this vs ~0% from a crash that occurred some time later.
Given that this problem will always result in a crash of the kernel
at some random time in the future, why don't we just make this error
an unconditional panic on get the crash over and done with?
Cheers,
Dave.
