Yes, slow and laborious, but it works...

OK.

OK.  Squashfs has much better compression and is much faster than 
cramfs, which is why many embedded systems that used cramfs have moved 
over to squashfs.  Additionally squashfs is used in liveCDs (where 
cramfs can't be used because of its max 256MB size limit), where it is 
slowly taking over from cloop, again because it compresses better and is 
faster.
Both these two groups have been asking for squashfs to be in the 
mainline kernel.
I can put the above rationale and a pointer to some performance 
statistics in the changelog, will that be sufficient?
