hey
I am using chelsio offload stack to tranfer data between two back to
back connected systems.
Now I using lighttpd server and http browser. After three-way
handskahe successful completed, when it start transfering of data it
gives me the following warning and then close the socket.
cxgb3 0000:01:00.0 CIM SDRAM address out of range (0x2)
cxgb3 0000:01:00.0 encountered fatal error. operation suspended.
cxgb3 0000:01:00.0 FW status: 0x0,0x0,0x0,0x0
n then i don't get anything on the browser side.
As i have tried to debug the problem i found that when skb is
nonlinear and skb->len became more then mtu, it give me this bug.
After that i have tried to linearize the skb and send but other side
it shows me a really html crapped data.
i am not able to clearly debug the problem. what i am doing wrong.
thanks
