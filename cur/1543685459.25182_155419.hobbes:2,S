Which exact corner case you are refering to?  video_release() being
called _after_ video_unregister_device() returns due to a sysfs file
being busy?  Doesn't sysfs refcounting take care of that?  If not
module_{get|put}(vfd->fops->owner) at sensible places should fix that.
get in video_unregister_device(), put in video_release()?

videodev.ko simply can't be unloaded while v4l drivers are loaded
due to symbol references.
