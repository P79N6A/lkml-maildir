The data storage exists in ".sections". The common ones are:
.text		Where the code is
.bss		Data initialized upon startup to zeros.
.data		Where non-local data are kept.
.rodata		Where non-writable strings are put.
.othernames	Defined by the implementor so that it can
		remain isolated.
The "othernames" are things like __ex_table and _text_lock.
A subsection is a finer-granularity section. They can't be
named, only numbered. Since each of the ".sections" are
separate, one can set up a specific trap on a section. For
instance, one can grab an out-of-bounds access in a ".section"
without seg-faulting the whole kernel. This helps provide
for a recovery mechanism should the kernel try to write to
an invalid user-provided buffer.
The keyword ".previous" is shorthand for just that. It tells
the assembler to emit data and/or code according to the previous
section.
If you are writing code under cygwin, you should not be encountering
spin-locks and kernel-specific things. Perhaps you are including
the wrong header files? You should never do:
	#include <linux/xxx.h>
	#include <asm/xxx.h>
... unless you are writing modules. And you don't do that in cygwin.
