yeah. I think this also fits into the special-case i mentioned: it isnt 
connected to something user-selectable, it's a side-effect of the first 
'feature selection' the user does: 'what platform do you compile your 
kernel on'. As such it is a convenience group-selection.
i.e. what we have behind this is still a clean tree of dependencies.
The mess begins i think when options with real code behind them start to 
grow back and forth dependencies in form of criss-crossing 'depends on' 
and 'select' instances.
