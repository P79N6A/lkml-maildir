#1 I doubt the time taken to look at include files that are #ifndef'd in 
their entirety is significant (I think there is special code in gcc to 
handle this case fast.)
#2 is actually a non-issue.  If each file is usable standalone (and have 
a multiple inclusion guard), then the include order shouldn't matter. 
Not that one can't create contrived cases where it would matter, but one 
can't solve every problem...
