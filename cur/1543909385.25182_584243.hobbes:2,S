And as was pointed out at the time, the people whining about that were
talking out of the wrong equipment. The supplier of the code can no more
or less easily change the binary as the matching source tree once its been
shipped. In fact its probably easier to change the binaries as the
sources will be left on CD.
The only non-stale source is git-blame.
