More importantly, it should be possible for root to write to /dev/random
_without_ increasing the entropy count, for example when restoring random
pool contents after reboot. In such cases you want the pool to contain
at least some unpredictable data before real entropy arrives, so that
/dev/urandom cannot be guessed, but you unless you remember the entropy
counter as well, you should not add any entropy.
				Have a nice fortnight
