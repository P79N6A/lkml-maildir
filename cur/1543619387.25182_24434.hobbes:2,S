rbtree are not too overhead for the rebalance, but the problem of not
using the hashtable is that you can't just pay with ram globally. Of
course you can enlarge the array for each radix node (that will end to
be a waste with an huge number of inodes with only a page in them), but
as the height of the tree increases performance will go down anyways (it
will never be as large as the global hashtable that we can tune
optimally at boot). With the hashtable the ram we pay for is not per inode,
but it's global.
I'm not optimistic it will work (even if it can be better than an rb or
an avl during the lookups because it pays more ram per tree node [and
per-inode], but still nearly not enoguh ram per node with big files to
be fast, and a big waste of ram with lots of inodes with a only 1 page
in them)
So I wouldn't merge it, at least until some math is done for the memory
consumation with 500k inodes with only 1 page in them each, and on the
number of heights/levels that must be walked during the tree lookup,
during a access at offset 10G (or worst case in general [biggest
height]) of an inode with 10G just allocated in pagecache.
