What was the size of uncompressed kernel binaries?
This is a simple (and somewhat inaccurate) measure of compiler
improvement ;)

Yes. M$ (and some other compilers) beat GCC badly.

I'm afraid it's code generation engine. It is just worse than
M$ or Intel's one. It is not easily fixable,
GCC folks have tremendous task at hand.
I wonder whether some big companies supposedly supporting 
Linux (e.g. Intel) can help GCC team (for example by giving
away some code and/or developer time).
