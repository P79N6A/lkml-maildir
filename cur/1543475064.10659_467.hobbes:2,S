International kernel patch 2.2.0-pre4.1 is available.  The idea of the
patch is to collect all crypto patches so that using crypto in the
kernel will be easier than today.
The patch is available from:
ftp://ftp.kerneli.org/pub/linux/kerneli/v2.1/patch-int-2.2.0-pre4.1.gz
The major news since last announcement is that more ciphers have been
added (DES, IDEA, Blowfish).  
NOTE: Please treat this patch as alpha software. 
The following has changed since the last announcement (2.1.131.4):
1999-01-04  Alexander Kjeldaas  <astor@guardian.no>
        * International kernel patch 2.2.0-pre4.1 released.
        * Removed obsolete loop_idea.c and loop_blow.c since IDEA and
        blowfish algorithms have been added to the crypto library.
        * drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c: Added loop_gen_init.  loop_gen only
        worked as a module.
1998-12-30  Alexander Kjeldaas  <astor@guardian.no>
        * crypto/testing/speed.c: i386-specific timer-code removed.
        * crypto configuration added for all architectures (previously
        only i386 was supported).  However, 64-bit and endian issues needs
        to be ironed out for a lot of platforms (maybe even i386).
1998-12-29  Alexander Kjeldaas  <astor@guardian.no>
        * International kernel patch 2.2.0-pre1.1 released.
        * International kernel patch 2.1.131.8 released.
        * DES/IDEA compile fixes.
1998-12-29  Raimar Falke <hawk@hawk.shef.ac.uk>
        * DES cipher added.  crypto/testing/speed.c fixes.
1998-12-18  Alexander Kjeldaas  <astor@guardian.no>
        * International kernel patch 2.1.131.7 released.
1998-12-18  Raimar Falke <hawk@hawk.shef.ac.uk>
        * include-fixes for IDEA cipher.
1998-12-18  Alexander Kjeldaas  <astor@guardian.no>
        * International kernel patch 2.1.131.6 released.
1998-12-18  Raimar Falke <hawk@hawk.shef.ac.uk>
        * IDEA cipher added.
1998-12-18  Patrice Lacroix  <tootix@writeme.com>
        * My latest patch for modular loop encryption. I think everything
        is in there. Ciphers are only requested on LOOP_SET_STATUS. Module
        count is always right (for what I have tested) and unloading now
        works.
1998-12-17  Alexander Kjeldaas  <astor@guardian.no>
        * International kernel patch 2.1.131.5 released.
1998-12-17  Raimar Falke <hawk@hawk.shef.ac.uk>
        * Extracted the blowfish code from loop_blow and made a
        cipher-module of it.
1998-12-17  Alexander Kjeldaas  <astor@guardian.no>
        * Removed loop_serpent, loop_mars, loop_dfc and loop_rc6 since
        their funcionality is available through loop_gen.
1998-12-16  Alexander Kjeldaas  <astor@guardian.no>
        * Removed loop_idea from the configuration menus.  It hasn't been
        converted to the new API.
1998-12-14  Alexander Kjeldaas  <astor@guardian.no>
        * Fixes to the rijndael cipher.  It builds, but isn't working
        properly so it it disabled for the moment.  The cipher is from
        Dr. Brian Gladman <gladman@seven77.demon.co.uk> AES
        reimplementation project.  More information on rijndael:
        
http://www.esat.kuleuven.ac.be/~rijmen/rijndael/
 Rijndael is free.
1998-12-14  Patrice Lacroix  <tootix@writeme.com>
        * More modular ciphers/loop patches. Cipher locking fixes.
        Autoloading of ciphers.  More loop and loop_gen integration.
On the ftp-site, the directory /pub/linux/kernel is a normal
kernel-mirror while /pub/linux/kerneli is a kernel-mirror plus the
international kernel patch.  You should find all utilities needed for
using crypto in the kernel in /pub/linux/kerneli/net-source/.
Enjoy,
astor
