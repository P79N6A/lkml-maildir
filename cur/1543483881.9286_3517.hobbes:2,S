Under the 2.0 kernels, I used cx5x86mod_1.0c to enable some of the
enhancements in the 5x86C chip.  Since the 2.2.1 kernel does such a good
job of indentifying the CPU, could some code be added to support the
features of this module from within the kernel?
I used to double my bogomips to almost 100 using this mod on a 100MHz
5x86C.  Anyway, the module no longer loads under 2.2.1.  It doesn't
recognize the symbol use_def.  I have upgraded to the latest modutils.
Any help/advice would be appreciated.
Dan
