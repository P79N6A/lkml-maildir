Thanks... but I think I need a bit more help.

The client in question is 129.94.211.194
It sends a UDP request to 129.94.172.12
The reply, addressed to 129.94.211.194 causes ARP requests on bartok's
eth1
Surely the route that applies is the 4th one, which seems to have a
correct 'src' parameter.
BTW, The routes were all created with 'route', not 'ip', incase it
matters.
