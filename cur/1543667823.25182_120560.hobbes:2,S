It doesn't exist. At lost, not on the part of Linux. The license of the
firmware may prohibit it.
The way I interpret the GPL you may link _any_ _data_ into a GPL'ed
program. Since this firmware is _data_ from the point of view of the kernel
(eg. the stream of execution never enters the firmware and it isn't mapped
to a text segment) there shouldn't be any problem.
It may still be preferable to choose another option, but linking the
firmware into a module has the advantage of the user being able to do
module autoloading without further configuration (eg. post-install lines in
modules.conf).
