I am not sure that page locking is done very strictly in the swap
cache. I had to fiddle around that sometimes in shmem.c. 
The patch actually is getting me the 'right error': Undead swap
entries in swapoff instead of bad swap entries in nopage. The latter
means there is a swapentry noted in the page table which was legally
removed. And that's definitely wrong.

Yes, I agree. I was too lazy to check the other uses of get_swap_page
for this patchlet. But at least shmem.c uses the same and I think it's
logical. We always need a swap cache and a user reference.

If this is right we should do this. There is no need to care about
contention in swapoff. It's definitely not the common path. But we
have to be careful about deadlocks....
