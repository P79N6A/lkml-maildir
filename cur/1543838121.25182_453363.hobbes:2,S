What if the packet is originally received on the device in question,
and then gets redirected to another device by a packet scheduler
traffic classifier action or a netfilter rule?
It is necessary to handle the case where the device changes on the
skb, and the skb gets freed up in a context and assosciation different
from when the skb was allocated (for example, different from the
device attached to the virtual block device).
