You will have much better success asking this on one of the SUSE mailing

Crazy though this sounds that's not actually a kernel question (this 
isn't really the place to get help with RPM)...

It workedforme but perhaps my usual tools are different to yours : ). I 
really recommend asking on a (friendly?) SUSE area about this as I 
suspect 
http://www.suse.de/~agruen/kernel-doc/
 (found via 
http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&client=safari&rls=en-us&q=suse
+compile+kernel&btnG=Search 
) might not detail quite enough steps to help you past this...
Good luck!
