Hello,
I was told I might have discovered a bug in the IDE code.  It was also
recommended to me that I not go into too much descriptive detail, so
I'll describe the problem as succinctly as I can and attach my logs.
I have been tryng to get a CastleWood (
http://www.castlewoodsystems.com
)
ORB drive to work with linux, kernel 2.0.36 (samething 7; whatever came
with RedHat 5.2.  I haven't installed the 2.2 kernel yet.)  The ORB is a
2.2Gb removable media drive with hard-drive performance (12Mb transfer,
10ms access). The media are low cost ($30) and small (Zip-media size),
the drives are low cost ($199) and small (fit into a half-height bay).
I have an internal IDE model.
The drive is recognized correctly, and I can partition, mkfs, and use
the drive with minimal problems - the most common being BUSY timeouts:
Feb 24 22:10:24 ender kernel: hdc: status timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }
Feb 24 22:10:24 ender kernel: hdc: no DRQ after issuing WRITE
Feb 24 22:10:25 ender kernel: ide1: reset: success
After dumping 800Mb of data to the drive, I found a single 50K file that
was corrupt.  I can unmount, eject, remount, and use the drive
regularly.  The real problem is that when I reboot, the drive will not
mount without dumping a large amount of errors of the type:
Feb 24 22:15:19 ender kernel: EXT2-fs error (device 16:01):
read_block_bitmap: Cannot read block bitmap - block_group = 224,
block_bitmap = 1835019
Feb 24 22:15:19 ender kernel: attempt to access beyond end of device
Feb 24 22:15:19 ender kernel: 16:01: rw=0, want=1843212, limit=1056352
and looking at the drive with fsck results in:
bash# fsck /dev/hdc1
Parallelizing fsck version 1.12 (9-Jul-98)
e2fsck 1.12, 9-Jul-98 for EXT2 FS 0.5b, 95/08/09
The filesystem size (according to the superblock) is 2153560 blocks
The physical size of the device is 1056352 blocks
Either the superblock or the partition table is likely to be corrupt!
Abort<y>?
However, fdisk reports the correct drive geometry.  The geometry is set
manually in BIOS to the values that the drive's instruction manual
listed (CHS = 4273,16,63) and "Normal" tranlation, and I pass
"hdc=4273,16,63" to lilo on booting.  This problem occurs whether or not
I boot the machine with media in the drive.
I have attached a segment of the system log (messages.txt.gz); the log
starts with the first error I get while running mke2fs.  I have also
attached a dump of "hdparm -i /dev/hdc".  Please let me know if there is
any other information I can get for you, and what your thoughts are on
the matter.
Thank you *very* much.
