Ok, I'll see what you are getting at considering the statements about
XFree 4 modularised driver support later. 
Here are some timing results which I consider enlightening. I'll have to
say I was surpised. These results were gotten by cycling the available
modes in X and panning around in the virtual screen with a mouse.
                     Name|Time (ms)|Times
-------------------------+---------+-----
pan_display              |   13.587|  268
encode_fix               |    0.011|   21
set_var                  |  464.447|   21
As you can see encode_fix does not call LRMI_int() and the time it takes
might be mostly gettimeofday() overhead (I have to change my timing
code to use rdtsc some time). However even pan_display which I know to be
just a couple of outb-instructions on CT6555x takes 13.5 ms. The time for
set_var() which might call SET_MODE, SET_LOGICAL_SCAN_LINE_LENGTH and
SET_DISPLAY_START depending of the mode is almost half a seconds. I have
to double-check that it does not try to clear the screen by itself but I'm
sure I got it right. Scheduling policy of the daemon was SCHED_RR.

Which makes sense. I haven't researched this myself but according to Matan
Ziv-Av (svgalib maintainer) supporting XFree 4 loadable modules will not
be a easy task. There are apparently hundreds of support functions which
these drivers need.

I had a feeling that this would be the case. Hence the idea concerning
black listing BIOSes. Thanks for the information. I knew that the BIOS of
my laptop (Toshiba) would not be alone in this respect. :(

Thank you. I certainly will.
