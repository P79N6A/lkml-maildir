OK, that compiles, but does not boot. Tt's not the *.S files, not the 
*.c, files, I think it's in the .h files somewhere.
Undoing *.S files did not help. Undoing *.c files did not help. 
Finally undoing the *.h files booted... I'll try to narrow it down more.
Yeah, this is UP machine. Also just remembered I don't have a serial port
for lowe level printk's :)
