Nice recovery, however, reading your original comment in context, it
appears that you were not aware of the method RTAI uses to prevent
priority inversions[1]:
 - I think the microkernel approach is fundamentally broken. Karim claims
   there is no priority inversion, but he must have his blinders on. Every
   single spinlock in the kernel assumes that the kernel isn't preempted,
   which means that user apps that can preempt the kernel cannot use them.
So, since you thought that the priority inversion problem was not solved,
then you must not have known about the second set of services.

Oh, but I think you just showed that you do need to do that, I think we
all do.
