What about "translated set2" ?
So far I have not yet seen cases where the translation was nonstandard.
That is, for all keyboards I have looked at or received reports on
the table given in
	
http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/kbd/scancodes-4.html#kscancodes
described the conversion from set2 to set1.
So, given the translated set2 codes, also the original set2 codes are
known with high probability. (The translation is almost 1-1.)
