Hi,
I'm just about always in favor of having automated tools help us find
bugs. However... can you give an indication of how many real bugs you
have encountered? If it's "mostly noise" all the time.. then it's maybe
not worth the effort... while if you find real bugs then it's obviously
worthwhile to go through this.
Greetings,
