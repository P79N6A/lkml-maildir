Yes, for example the NatSemi SC2200 has a 32+1 bit "High Resolution
Timer" that can be clocked either at 1MHz or 27MHz and that can
generate an interrupt whenever it wraps around.
Just using the High Resolution timer would avoid the known problems
with the TSC (stops on HLT, a bug when the low 32 bits of the TSC wrap
around) and the PIT (something somewhere, maybe SMM mode, seems to
mess upp the latch values).
