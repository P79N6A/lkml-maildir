The only interaction with you that I've ever had, according to my outbox, 
is on Date: Mon, 30 Oct 2000 15:38:43 -0800 where you asked about BK, 
said there wasn't an image for you platform, I asked what platform, and
so far haven't heard back, at least I have no record of it.
Bootstrapping BK on a new platform isn't easy, you need BK to do it, so
we do it by hand for each new platform.  We try and provide images for
all platforms, so it would be nice to know what it is that you have.
And, it would be nice if you raised the issue with us rather than the 
kernel list, they aren't going to build your BK image for you.
