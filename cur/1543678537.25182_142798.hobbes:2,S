Hi,
Here's some PCI fixes that are against the latest 2.5.73 bk tree.
They fix the compile error that a number of people have reported with
2.5.73 and CONFIG_HOTPLUG=n.  It also has some more acpi pci cleanups by 
Matthew Wilcox.
Please pull from:

thanks,
greg k-h
p.s. I'll send these as patches in response to this email to lkml for
those who want to see them.
