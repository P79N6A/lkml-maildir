It isn't a bug. It is a feature; Think about silent corruption that
may damage your filesystem; Only an FSCK can see how much of damage is
done and fix it. Journaling will help you to a degree, but not all the
way.

heh, the way I look at it, you either have the time, or money. Use one
and get rid of your problem. If you have them and aren't willing to
commit to fix your problem, maybe your problem isn't important enough
to you. If you have no time and no money, ranting here doesn't help
you either.
