}    It's not a new idea but that doesn't make it a good one.  The idea
}    of distributing the _same_ compiler but different versions is
}    nutty.
} 
} Actually, this is common practice even in the commercial UNIX world
} for kernel development.  I have seen several UNIX vendors who use a
} specific version of a specific compiler for kernel development.  When
} you want to build a kernel, you check out the kernel build kit, and
} this is the compiler that gets used.
} 
} I honestly see nothing wrong with it.  There are different parts of
} the compiler stressed by the kernel build as opposed to most userland
} compilation, and furthermore the desired compiler stability/feature
} ratio is different for each task.  So one way to solve these differing
} needs is to simply use different compilers.
I remember building kernels on SunOS systems and I don't remember it
fondly.  I don't think "it's been done in UNIX before" is a strong argument
for something being done now :)
I remember doing builds on redhat systems with 'make' but now what
do I need to do?  Tinker around with the Makefile, do 'make CC=kgcc' or
what's the advised build methodology for the kernel with redhat now?
I pray the PowerPC distributions don't follow in this path...
