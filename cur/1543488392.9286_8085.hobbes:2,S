First guess is you've got a bad bit somewhere in memory, which is
notoriously hard to test. First thing to do is devise a test that shows up
the problem. One that works for a lot of people is doing a large gzip, for
instance with the kernel source. Using md5sum, you should be able to
repeatedly zip a large file and get an identical checksum.
Once you've managed to repeat it, try swapping out RAM and test again. 
Then try switching kernels, drive cables, and drives.
The reason a memory error might show up with 2.2 and not 2.0 is that usage
patterns have changed substantially.
