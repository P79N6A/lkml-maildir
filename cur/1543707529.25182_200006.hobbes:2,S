In my copy of tux-3.2.13, the number 242 is used correctly. That number
is the one that is reserved in the official linux sources. Martin
allocated it exactly one year ago when I sent the patch enabling 
s390 in tux to Florian La Roche <laroche@redhat.com>.
If you have a really old version of the tux sources, there might
be the fallback to number 222 still there (which is a pretty dumb
idea, btw).
