Another requirement that I have that makes it difficult for me to disable 
CONFIG_PCI is that the hardware component that is running Windows (and 
therefore the PCI host) is optional hardware. If the Windows part is not 
present, then the IXP will be configured (via hardware means) as a PCI host. 
So, I need to detect at run time whether the IXP is in PCI option or PCI host 
mode. If it is in PCI host mode then the code encapuslated by CONFIG_PCI must 
be available.
I can see now that I also have a need to have a "CONFIG_PCI_GADGET".
